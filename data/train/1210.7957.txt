    "we shall consider an external potential corresponding to a cubic optical lattice @xcite ( generalizations to other lattice configurations are quite straightforward ) : v(r)= _ t = x , y , z s_t ^2 ( k e_tr ) where @xmath93 is the depth of the periodic standing wave potential in the @xmath94 -direction , @xmath95 - versor in the corresponding direction , while @xmath96 the wavevector for light with wavelength @xmath27 .",

    "this representation of the hamiltonian is _ exact _ ( formally in a sense that the convergence of infinite series expansions requires a missing proof ) .",
    "the approximations emerge when we limit the number of bands as well as put restrictions on the hamiltonian parameters . in particular , restricting the expansion to the lowest band only , assuming that the tunneling amplitudes are non - zero to nearest neigbors while interactions are entirely on - site , we recover the standard bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite . since we will be interested in processes populating excited bands we shall take them into account , limiting ourselves to several of them in each direction .",

    "<S> the studied system is a 2d lattice with the tight harmonic confinement in the third direction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the system is assumed to be in a deep mott insulator regime @xmath81 due to a deep lattice potential , the inter - site hopping can be neglected , and the whole system decouples into independent 2d sites with the ( assumed ) integer filling @xmath82 we have prepared the system in the ground state @xmath83 with energy @xmath84 following @xcite we restrict the numerical simulation to first three bands ( while this may not be sufficient for a simulation of a real situation since @xmath52 terms efficiently populate higher bands we consider the _ same _ model as in @xcite to isolate the influence of wannier functions dynamics ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed the numerical evolution of the system for time corresponding to @xmath85 with varying frequencies @xmath86 as in @xcite we measure the maximal ground state depletion : @xmath87 }   |\\langle \\psi_{\\omega_x}(t ) | \\psi(0)\\rangle| $ ] as a function of the driving frequency @xmath86 we find that the presence of @xmath52 term changes significantly the depletion function in the frequency range considered ( compare fig.[fig : sow2606 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> we have found that including the @xmath52 term in the analysis makes the process much faster and efficient . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation period is decreased usually several times with similar excitation efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , while confirming the possibility of direct resonant transfer of population to excited bands by lattice depth modulation , our analysis suggests that taking the time variation of wannier functions into account is crucial for controlling the process and for selective excitation of desired bands .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the @xmath52 term in the hamiltonian , ( [ eq : trans ] ) , may be also analyzed using the floquet approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> exemplary spectra inspecting the broad structure around @xmath88 in the depletion function are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : floq ] . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum without @xmath52 contribution shows a single isolated avoided crossing indicating a simple resonance ( corresponding to the isolated peak in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sow2606 ] ) in a contrast to broad structure of avoided crossings for the quasi - exact evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this structure correlates well with the broadened peaks observed in the depletion function .    to understand this striking difference it is enough to consider the magnitude of different oscillatory terms in the hamiltonian . for a deep lattice , </S>",
    "<S> when the tunneling is negligible and a single site is considered only @xcite the driving comes from the time dependence interaction term as well as from @xmath52 term . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant interaction term @xmath89 may be expanded as [ compare ( [ st ] ) ] u^0000(s)u^0000(s^0_x ) + s_m t 1.45 + 0.050 t [ ut ] for @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( in recoil units ) . the dominant intrasite hopping term coming from the @xmath52 term t^20_0(s ) & & ( t^20_0(s^0_x)+ s_m t)s_mt & & 0.79 t-0.0262 t [ tt ] for @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the driving term coming from @xmath52 contribution is an order of magnitude stronger than driving induced by a modulation of interactions ! </S>",
    "<S> the presence of an `` in phase '' and `` in quadrature '' driving breaks the time - reversal invariance @xcite that strongly affects the structure of avoided crossings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover @xmath52 term brings strong second harmonic which additionally strongly modifies floquet spectrum as well as the dynamics . for parameters of @xcite the @xmath52 term dominates the dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> let us mention also that the importance of the @xmath52 term in the evolution appears also for sufficiently fast oscillatory movement of the lattice sites with a fixed lattice depth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the selection rules for excitations are then modified with respect to the simple , translationally invariant , symmetric situation discussed here @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other possible applications of the presented formalism may be thought of due to the generality of the arguments leading to eq .  </S>",

    "<S> in particular , with appropriate modifications it can be formulated for fermions as well .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have shown that great care has to be taken when using discretized tight - binding approximations for atomic systems in optical lattices in the presence of fast time variations of optical lattice parameters . </S>",
    "<S> a transformation to wannier functions basis involves time dependent terms reflecting the time dependence of wannier functions themselves . </S>",
    "<S> these terms modify the tight - binding hamiltonian and are responsible for appreciable and directly experimentally measurable effects whenever the change of lattice parameters is sufficiently fast .    </S>",
    "<S> recently a variational approach for studying non - equilibrium dynamics has been developed using time - dependent wannier basis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the variational ansatz assumes a _ single _ time dependent wannier function per site ( thus all particles at a given site must be in the same mode ) . </S>",
    "<S> while this approach seems promising in certain applications , it fails to treat real transitions to excited bands whenever there are two or more particles per site ( e.g. it can not represent properly the entangled two particle state with one of them in the lowest , the other in some higher band ) . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed comparison of both approaches with the possible generalizations will be performed elsewhere .    </S>",
