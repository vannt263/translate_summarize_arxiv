    "let @xmath2 be a non - archimedean local field .",
    "by the local langlands correspondence for @xmath3 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , irreducible supercuspidal representations of @xmath3 are parameterized by @xmath4-dimensional irreducible smooth representations of the weil group @xmath5 of @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "irreducible supercuspidal representations of @xmath3 are completely classified by the theory of types @xcite .",
    "however , in general it is very difficult to determine the parameter corresponding to each supercuspidal representation explicitly .",
    "this problem , called `` the explicit local langlands correspondence '' , is extensively studied by bushnell and henniart ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , imai and tsushima @xcite also gave a result in this direction , which is not covered by the works cited above .",
    "the methods in all of these works are purely algebraic , and sometimes involve very detailed and complicated computations .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose a new geometric method for the explicit local langlands correspondence .",
    "it is well - known that the local langlands correspondence for @xmath3 has a nice geometric realization ; it appears in the middle degree @xmath6-adic cohomology of the lubin - tate tower . this fact is called the non - abelian lubin - tate theory after carayol @xcite , and has been proved by harris - taylor @xcite and boyer @xcite . therefore , it is quite natural to expect that we can understand the local langlands correspondence by studying the geometry of the lubin - tate tower .",
    "apart from many results in the case @xmath7 , the first result in this direction was given by yoshida @xcite .",
    "he constructed a semistable model of the first layer of the lubin - tate tower , and discovered the deligne - lusztig variety for @xmath8 in the reduction of it . by using this result",
    ", he concluded that a part of the non - abelian lubin - tate theory boils down to the deligne - lusztig theory @xcite .",
    "more recently , the lubin - tate space at infinite level , namely the projective limit of the lubin - tate tower , turns out to be much simpler than individual layers .",
    "this idea goes back to faltings @xcite and fargues @xcite , and now is formulated by the theory of perfectoid spaces @xcite ; see @xcite and @xcite for detail .",
    "based on this theory , weinstein and boyarchenko @xcite constructed a family of affinoids in the lubin - tate space at infinite level",
    ". they also constructed formal models of the affinoids , and observed that a part of the local langlands correspondence is encoded in the @xmath6-adic cohomology of their reduction . following this work ,",
    "some other authors also obtain similar results ; see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . the common strategy in these works is to combine an explicit computation of the reduction of the formal models and a previously known explicit description of the local langlands correspondence . the idea of this article is to reverse this process ; we combine a computation of the reduction and the non - abelian lubin - tate theory to obtain a result in the explicit local langlands correspondence . to carry it out ,",
    "we need to relate the cohomology of the reduction with that of the lubin - tate tower itself , which is not included in the previous works .",
    "the main ingredient of this article is to give a useful condition which ensures the existence of such a relation .",
    "here is a key technical result for us :    [ thm : specialization - injectivity - intro ] let @xmath9 be a complete algebraically closed non - archimedean field , @xmath10 its valuation ring , and @xmath11 the residue field of @xmath10 .",
    "assume that the characteristic of @xmath11 is positive .",
    "fix a non - zero element @xmath12 in the maximal ideal of @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a @xmath12-adically complete flat @xmath10-algebra endowed with an action of a profinite group @xmath14 .",
    "we write @xmath15 for the integral closure of @xmath13 in @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "we assume the following two conditions ( see section 3 for detail ) :    * the space @xmath17,\\widetilde{a})$ ] is the projective limit of a tower @xmath18 of smooth affinoids over @xmath9 indexed by open normal subgroups @xmath19 of @xmath14 . *",
    "the reduction @xmath20 of @xmath21 is the perfection of an affine scheme @xmath22 of finite type over @xmath11 .    1 .   for a prime number @xmath6 invertible in @xmath11",
    ", we have a map @xmath23 which we call the specialization map .",
    "it is functorial with respect to automorphisms of @xmath13 of finite level ( i.e. , automorphisms coming from those of the tower @xmath18 ) .",
    "2 .   assume moreover that @xmath22 is pure - dimensional and smooth over @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath24 be a tower of rigid spaces which contains @xmath18 as a tower of open rigid subspaces .",
    "for a subspace @xmath25 such that the composite @xmath26 is injective , the composite @xmath27 is also injective .    in the application",
    ", @xmath28 becomes the lubin - tate tower , @xmath17,\\widetilde{a})$ ] an affinoid in the lubin - tate space at infinite level , and @xmath21 a formal model of it .",
    "we remark that , unlike the case of finite type , the specialization map @xmath29 is not necessarily surjective , even if @xmath22 is smooth ( see example [ exa : non - reduced ] ) .    to demonstrate how theorem [ thm : specialization - injectivity - intro ] is used to give an explicit description of the local langlands correspondence , we choose two classes of irreducible supercuspidal representations as examples ; one is depth @xmath1 supercuspidal representations and the other is simple supercuspidal representations .",
    "recall that the latter are supercuspidal representations with minimal positive depth ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . by geometric method",
    ", we will obtain the following result :    [ thm : explicit - llc - intro ] let @xmath30 be either a depth @xmath1 supercuspidal representation or a simple supercuspidal representation .",
    "then , we can describe the langlands parameter of @xmath30 explicitly .    for a more precise statement ,",
    "see theorems [ thm : llc - jljc - depth-0 ] and [ thm : llc - jljc - ssc ] .",
    "we can also determine the image of @xmath30 under the local jacquet - langlands correspondence between @xmath3 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the central division algebra over @xmath2 with invariant @xmath33 .",
    "note that the resulting description in theorem [ thm : explicit - llc - intro ] is not new , as in remarks [ rem : history - depth-0 ] , [ rem : history - ssc ] .",
    "however our proof is totally different from the previous ones .",
    "we do not need to investigate involved representations closely .",
    "in fact , we do not have to compute neither characters nor epsilon factors .",
    "the author expects that the same method can be applied to supercuspidal representations with larger depth .",
    "this will be considered in our future works .",
    "the idea to see the map @xmath34 in theorem [ thm : specialization - injectivity - intro ] ( ii ) emerged from discussion with takahiro tsushima .",
    "after we wrote this paper , we are informed that tsushima is also working on a similar problem in the case where @xmath7 and @xmath2 is an odd equal characteristic local field .",
    "he also pays attention to the map @xmath34 , but his basic strategy is to find a family of affinoids with good reduction in the lubin - tate spaces at suitable finite levels , which is different from ours .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : finite - level ] , we give an analogous result as theorem [ thm : specialization - injectivity - intro ] in the finite level setting by using the theory of formal nearby cycles . in section [ sec : infinite - level ] , we deduce theorem [ thm : specialization - injectivity - intro ] from the finite level case .",
    "to enable this step , we should allow bad reduction in section [ sec : finite - level ] , even if the reduction appearing in theorem [ thm : specialization - injectivity - intro ] is the perfection of a smooth affine scheme over @xmath11 . in section [ sec : lt - tower",
    "] , we recall the definition of the lubin - tate tower and the statement of the non - abelian lubin - tate theory .",
    "we also verify that theorem [ thm : specialization - injectivity - intro ] is applicable to an affinoid in the lubin - tate space at infinite level . in section [ sec : depth-0 ] , we explicitly describe the langlands parameter of a depth @xmath1 supercuspidal representation .",
    "we use a formal model of an affinoid whose reduction becomes the perfection of the deligne - lusztig variety for @xmath8 .",
    "this formal model can be seen as the infinite level version of a piece of the model constructed by yoshida @xcite . in section [ sec : ssc ] , we give a description of the langlands parameter of a simple supercuspidal representation . here",
    "we use results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "appendix [ sec : ring - theory ] contains some results for algebras over the valuation ring @xmath10 which do not satisfy any finiteness condition .",
    "the results on the cohomology of the artin - schreier sheaves in appendix [ sec : artin - schreier ] are used in section [ sec : ssc ] .    * acknowledgment*the author is grateful to takahiro tsushima for inspiring discussions .",
    "he also learned many techniques to treat the @xmath6-adic cohomology of the artin - schreier varieties from him .",
    "the author also thanks kazuki tokimoto for motivating discussions .",
