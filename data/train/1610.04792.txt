    "hess j0632 + 057 ( mwc148 ; hd259440 ) is one of the most interesting tev @xmath1-ray binaries @xcite .",
    "the optical star is known to be a b0 emission line star , though the nature of the compact companion ( a neutron star or a black hole ) remains uncertain @xcite .",
    "the object displays periodic variations on several different time - scales .",
    "the most pronounced variations , derived from x - ray data , were detected with a period of 315@xmath10 ( or 321@xmath115 ) days @xcite which is considered to be the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "other variability includes :    * h@xmath12 line variations with a period of @xmath1360@xmath14 detected by @xcite , possibly attributed to a spiral density wave in the circumstellar disc , * @xmath1-ray variability on time - scales of the order of one to two months , possibly linked to the x - ray outburst that occurs about 100 days after periastron passage @xcite , * clear evidence of strong x - ray variability on multiple timescales , with the measured flux doubling on time - scales as short as @xmath135 days @xcite .

    "multicolour optical polarimetry ( linear and circular ) of hess j0632 + 057 was carried out in two sets ( set `` i '' : 2015 march 24 ( jd 2457106 ) and set `` ii '' : 2015 december 12 ( jd 2457369 ) ) at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "saao s high speed polarimeter , hippo @xcite , was used to conduct all stokes mode photopolarimetry of hess j0632 + 057 on the saao 1.9 m telescope .",
    "observations were made with johnson @xmath0 filters .",
    "in addition , observations of a field star ( gsc 00158 - 01500 ) were performed in the same mode during jd 2457106 .",
    "this a0v star ( m@xmath15@xmath1612.1 ; `` star in cluster '' ) is located very close to hess j0632 + 057 ( 2 arcmin ) and was used to estimate the interstellar polarisation .",
    "the fk5 coordinates ( ep = j2000 eq=2000 ) for gsc 00158 - 01500 are 06 32 55.51 + 05 49 29.9 , while for hess j0632 + 057 the coordinates are 06 32 59.254 + 05 48 01.18 .",
    "the resulting polarisation measurements for hess j0632 + 057 are presented in table  2 .",
    "assuming the orbital phase 0 is at t@xmath17=mjd 2454857 @xcite , the date of set `` i '' observations correspond to an orbital phase of 0.140 ( if the period is 315 days ) , or phase 0.006 ( if the period is 321 days ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the set `` ii '' observations fall at a phase of 0.975 ( for 315 days ) , or 0.826 ( for 321 days ) . in either case ,",
    "our observations were performed close to periastron passage - just after for set `` i '' and just before ( the subsequent periastron passage ) for set `` ii '' .",
    "as we noted in sect.1 , previously published polarimetric data for hess j0632 + 057 are very limited .",
    "the first observations made by @xcite at wavelength @xmath18 ( i.e. close to the photometric band v ) observed polarisation to be p=4.0 per cent at @xmath19 .",
    "later , values of p=3.9 per cent at @xmath20 were published by @xcite without any indication of the wavelength used .",
    "we will assume further , that this data corresponded to the v - band .",
    "the first multi - band measurements of polarisation were presented by @xcite , but with large errors in the red ( @xmath210.2 per cent at wavelengths @xmath130.8 - 0.9@xmath22 m ) . for these observations , the position angle ( @xmath23 )",
    "was also found to be between @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "the most recent polarimetric data were published by @xcite and showed polarisation ranging from p@xmath133.5 per cent to p@xmath133.9 per cent with @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( see table  2 ) .    as shown by our set `` i '' data , the object displayed statistically higher polarisation than all previous measurements ( @xmath284.21 per cent ) .",
    "in addition , the value of detected polarisation in the red ( @xmath293.8 per cent ) and in the blue ( @xmath303.4 per cent ) were around 0.5 per cent higher than noted by @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the position angle ( @xmath3 ) is also different by @xmath136@xmath3110@xmath31 from previously published values .",
    "the polarised standard star , hd154445 @xcite was observed in order to calculate the position angle offsets and efficiency factors .",
    "unpolarised standard stars were used to measure any instrumental polarisation ( 0.4 per cent , 0.3 per cent , @xmath320.1 per cent , @xmath320.1 per cent , @xmath320.1 per cent in ubvri correspondingly ) .",
    "these values of instrumental polarisation were vectorially subtracted from the observation values .",
    "background sky polarisation measurements were also taken at frequent intervals during the observations .",
    "thus , we can confidently rule out any instrumental effects and conclude that the increase in polarisation and shift in the observed position angle are real and intrinsic to the source .",
    "our set `` ii '' data show statistically lower polarisation values ( by around 0.2 - 0.4 per cent ) in all photometric bands compared to set `` i '' ( see fig .  1 and table  2 )",
    ". the position angle also changed from @xmath33 ( for set `` i '' ) to @xmath34 .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the observed polarisation for both of our datasets was also different from that of @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) . according to @xcite the maximum polarisation occurred at @xmath35=0.62@xmath22 m , while in our data the maximum is in the `` v''-band for both of our datasets .",
    "the difference between our data and that previously published is even more pronounced on a qu - diagram of stokes parameters ( fig .",
    "it is immediately obvious that our set `` i '' data are concentrated well outside the group of previously published values .",
    "the set `` ii '' data are located in the space between set `` i '' and all other previously published values .",
    "it is seen also in fig .  2 , that the data as a whole are spread out around a straight line in the qu - plane although the correlation coefficient is not large : r=0.33 for unweighted data ( weighting takes into account the observational errors changes the result insignificantly ) .",
    "this may be linked to orbital phase , as a smooth increase in polarisation the closer the compact object gets to periastron .",
    "note , however , that @xcite found a very different linear behaviour using only v - band data of @xcite .",
    "straight lines in @xcite and in fig",
    ".  2 of the present work are approximately perpendicular one to another in qu - plane .",
    "better time sampled polarimetric monitoring covering the orbital phase is required to investigate this further . finally , the analysis of qu - diagram ( fig .  2 ) allow us to decline ( at least to date ) the statement of @xcite on the possibility that `` the data trace an ellipse in the qu - plane '' .",
    "generally , no significant circular polarisation was detected in either dataset .",
    "however , marginally significant ( @xmath132@xmath36 ) circular polarisation is seen in the `` v '' and `` i '' bands for set `` i '' at the level @xmath130.05 per cent , but with opposite signs . marginally significant ( @xmath132@xmath36 )",
    "circular polarisation was also seen in the `` u '' band for set `` ii '' at the level @xmath130.17 per cent .",
    "this result is in line with the data of @xcite , who noted that circular polarisation in hess j0632 + 057 is very low , if it is present at all .",
    "to date , we have two estimates of interstellar polarisation toward the object .",
    "first is the estimate by @xcite ",
    "p@xmath37@xmath162 per cent and @xmath38165@xmath39 ( using the `` field star method '' for 28 field stars in 3@xmath31 vicinity of hess j0632 + 057 ) and second is the data obtained for the nearby field star ( gsc 00158 - 01500 ) in this work . this field star is located just 2 from hess j0632 + 057 ( see fig .  3 ) and was not included in the previous interstellar polarisation estimate by @xcite . the nearest star from @xcite catalogue used by @xcite for his interstellar polarisation estimate ( hd 45910 )",
    "is located @xmath1340 away from hess j0632 + 057 .",
    "v - band measurements obtained on the same date ( jd 2457106.3413561 ) indicate the degree of polarisation of p@xmath40 per cent with @xmath41 . unfortunately , as this field star is relatively faint ( m@xmath42@xmath1612.6;12.1;12.7 respectively ) , the detected degree of polarisation does not exceed the 3@xmath36 level in the `` bri '' bands . nevertheless , the degree of polarisation detected in the `` bri '' bands is less than 0.6 per cent .    =",
    "0.7@xmath22 m was used instead of @xmath43=0.55@xmath22m.,width=340 ]    in order to obtain the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic polarisation of the source , the interstellar component , p@xmath37 , needs to be subtracted in all photometric bands .",
    "we can do this by using both estimates of p@xmath37 for our observing data of two epochs reported above - set i and set ii . for the data of @xcite",
    ", we assume that p@xmath442 per cent , @xmath38165@xmath39 and @xmath43=0.55@xmath22 m .",
    "the values of interstellar polarisation in other photometric bands were calculated using the standard `` serkowski s law '' @xcite .",
    "vectorial subtraction of these values of interstellar polarisation from the observed ones allow us to re - construct the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic polarisation ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "note , that only `` v '' band measurements for 28 field stars used by @xcite for the estimate of interstellar polarisation are available in @xcite .",
    "therefore , some uncertainty in @xmath43 value may occur . however , changing of @xmath43 value from 0.55@xmath22 m to 0.7@xmath22 m will change the resulting intrinsic @xmath45 dependence insignificantly ( see dotted line in fig .  4 as an example ) .",
    "using this estimation of p@xmath37 , the average values of the intrinsic polarisation for hess j0632 + 057 are p@xmath161.8 per cent to 2.2 per cent and @xmath46 .    in fig .",
    "we also plot the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic polarisation calculated by vectorial subtraction of the field star observed during this work , using the above described procedure .",
    "we assume that p@xmath440.65 per cent , @xmath38153@xmath39 and @xmath43=0.55@xmath22 m . in this case , the average values of the intrinsic polarisation for hess j0632 + 057 are p@xmath163 per cent to 3.5 per cent and @xmath47 .",
    "note that in either case , the intrinsic p(@xmath35 ) dependence is essentially flat , without noticeably decreasing in the red .",
    "similar p(@xmath35 ) distributions are often observed in classical be stars and are attributed to scattering in flattened circumstellar gaseous discs and/or jets around them ( see also the polarimetric study of the microquasar ls i + 61@xmath39303 by @xcite ) .",
    "we propose that thomson scattering in a gaseous disc ( see , for example , the discussion of optical polarisation in the high - mass x - ray binary ls 5039 by @xcite ) may be the dominant mechanism for producing the polarisation behaviour in hess j0632 + 057 ( at least close to periastron passage ) . another possibility is discussed by @xcite in the context of synchrotron emission from jets launched close to black holes or neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries . in this case , however , strong polarimetric variability can be expected in the near - ir .",
    "we have shown that the observed polarisation in hess j0632 + 057 , close to periastron passage , is statistically different from previously published measurements .",
    "the detected polarisation degree , just after periastron , is higher than previously observed with a shift of 6@xmath31 - 10@xmath31 in position angle .",
    "we propose that these changes arise from the interaction of the compact object with a circumstellar disc near periastron passage , and/or some redistribution of the material within the circumstellar disc .",
    "according to @xcite , the compact object moves deeply through the circumstellar disc during periastron passage , in the zones associated with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 line formation , i.e. crossing dense regions of the disc @xcite . at this orbital phase ,",
    "different events may occur , such as : the interaction of the stellar wind with the wind or jet of the compact object ; a strong flow of matter from the be star can be captured by the compact object resulting in the formation of an accretion disc or gaseous tail ; the disruption of the circumstellar disc by the compact object etc .",
    "( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . therefore",
    ", some perturbation of circumstellar material at this orbital phase or the formation of an additional source of polarisation can not be surprising .",
    "on the other hand , the be disc can be misaligned with the orbital plane @xcite . in this case",
    ", the formation of a tilted accretion disc , formation of a jet which is non - orthogonal to the be disc , or formation of a tail from gas captured by a compact object may result in a shift in the position angle of the observed polarisation , as detected here .",
    "if the polarimetric variations reported here ( especially for set `` i '' ) are linked to some form of perturbations in the circumstellar disc or the formation of an additional source of polarisation started just after the periastron passage , then we can expect further increase of polarisation at phases up to @xmath130.3 - 0.5 . in this context , the object exhibits a main outburst , at tev and x - rays , at orbital phases @xmath130.3 and a secondary lower outburst at orbital phases @xmath130.7 @xcite .",
    "therefore , one might expect the geometry of the circumstellar envelope to also change during these phases .",
    "depolarisation across the h@xmath51 line , which is often observed in many early - type objects , can be used as a method for independently deriving the interstellar polarisation @xcite and circumstellar envelope geometry .",
    "therefore , spectropolarimetry around h@xmath51 would be very helpful .",
    "finally , higher - precision polarimetric measurements over the orbital period are needed to study the hess j0632 + 057 behavior in the qu - plane . to date , our limited observations do not allow us to make definitive conclusions about the geometry of the system , or the mechanisms responsible for the detected polarimetric variations .",
    "most extensive polarimetric data were obtained by @xcite in `` u , b , v '' bands .",
    "lack of polarimetric data in `` r , i '' does not allow to analyze the object in a whole spectral region .",
    "near - ir polarimetric data would also be strongly desirable .    therefore , additional multi - epoch and multicolour polarimetric observations covering the entire orbit are strongly desirable to verify potential orbital phase variations in the polarisation degree and to map the geometry of the hess j0632 + 057 system .",
