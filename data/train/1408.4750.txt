    "the kinematics of the narrow line region ( nlr ) of ngc1068 has been the subject of many studies over the years , the most recent and detailed being those of @xcite and @xcite , based on long - slit optical spectroscopy of the inner few hundred parsecs obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph aboard the hubble space telescope ( _ hst - stis _ ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that the nlr gas is outflowing in a hollow bi - cone , along which the gas seems to be accelerated up to 140pc from the nucleus and then decelerated .",
    "integral field optical spectroscopy of the inner 1.5kpc was obtained by @xcite using the instrument sauron  at lower spatial resolution but covering a larger region of the galaxy than in @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed the outflow in [ oiii ]  @xmath55007 and h@xmath14 , finding also streaming motions towards the nucleus and emission knots of h@xmath14 attributed to regions of star formation in the galaxy plane .",
    "@xcite presented optical integral field observations of the inner 400pc using the gemini multi - object spectrograph integral field unit ( gmos - ifu ) at a better spatial resolution ( @xmath1340pc ) which revealed , besides high - velocity gas emission from outflowing gas , also some emission from the gas in the galaxy disc .    in the near - infrared ( hereafter near - ir ) , @xcite and",
    "@xcite have mapped the gas kinematics via integral field observations using the instrument sinfoni at the very large telescope ( vlt ) . while @xcite focus on the h@xmath11 kinematics in the inner few tens of pc which revealed inflows , @xcite focus on the br@xmath4 and coronal lines kinematics , which are dominated by outflows .    in @xcite ( hereafter paper  i ) we have used the gemini near - infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs ) on the gemini north telescope operating with the adaptive optics module altair to map the flux distributions and excitation of the gas within the inner @xmath15pc , while in @xcite we have studied the stellar population .    in this paper , we present detailed measurements of the gas kinematics observed in the near - ir emission lines [ feii ]  @xmath2 m , h@xmath3 m and br@xmath4 using channel maps and position velocity diagrams .",
    "we concluded this is the best way to separate the multiple kinematic components which are present in the emitting gas in this galaxy .",
    "the [ feii ] gas kinematics shows a  broader \" outflow than previously observed in [ oiii ] and in the near - ir coronal lines , being similar to that observed in planetary nebulae and consistent with an origin in an accretion disc wind @xcite or a torus wind @xcite .",

    "nifs has a square field of view of 3  @xmath16 3  and was set to a position angle of 300 degrees for the observations , resulting in a spatial sampling of 0.044 arcsec perpendicular to the jet ( vertical direction in our images ) and 0.103 arcsec along it ( horizontal direction in our images ) .",

    "the n wall of the hourglass is observed covering a range of blueshifts and redshifts , while the e wall is observed mostly in redshift .",
    "the n and e walls of the hourglass do not keep the same pa and structure over the velocity channels due to the patchy nature of the emitting gas and also because of the hourglass geometry and its relative orientation to the line of sight .",

    "[ fig - channel - map - bra ] shows that the flux distribution in [ oiii ] ( contours ) is very similar to that of br@xmath4 and so we assume that their emission originate in the same gas and consequently the kinematics of the [ oiii ] and br@xmath4 should also be similar .",
    "the blueshift channels correspond to the front wall of the outflow and the redshift channels correspond to the back wall . from this figure",
    "it is not clear that the geometry of the outflow is conical as derived by @xcite . in our data",
    "the brightest emission comes , from a narrow region extending from the nucleus to the n - ne , being stronger in the blueshift channels .",
    "this emission comes from the front wall of the outflow which is at higher galactic latitude than the emission from the back wall , that is observed in redshift .",
    "additionally , the emission coming from the sw side of the outflow is observed in redshift corresponding to emission from the back wall of the outflow which is at higher galactic latitude than that of the front wall .",
    "@xcite derived the conical geometry for the outflow from the kinematics that they could obtain from deep stis long - slit spectroscopy of the whole region , not from the flux maps .",
    "the approximately conical geometry is better seen in the [ feii ] channel maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig - channel - map - fe ] ) , and in particular , in the redshift channels .",
    "while the br@xmath4 emission distribution is concentrated and mostly directed towards north , the [ feii ] emission distribution encompasses it and extends further spanning a wide hourglass shaped area more clearly seen to ne of the nucleus between pa  @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the redshift channels .",
    "the difference between [ feii ] and br@xmath4 flux distribution and kinematics can be understood as follows . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "most of the [ fe ii ] emission comes from a region where h is only partially ionized . in the completely ionized region , as the ionization potential of fe+ is just 16.2ev , fe+ is further ionized and there is not much [ feii ] emission .",
    "extensive partially ionized zones around the nlr of seyfert galaxies are created by x - rays that have small cross sections and penetrate deeper in the gas than less energetic photons , heating the gas .",
    "the [ feii]@xmath2 m emission is excited in these partially ionized zones by collisions with electrons , as well as by shocks that may be present due to the interaction of agn jets and winds with the ambient gas .",
    "the extent of the partially ionized region determines where we may find [ feii ] emission .",
    "the larger extent of the [ feii ] emitting region compared to that of the br@xmath4 can thus be understood as caused by the existence of a partially ionized zone extending beyond the fully ionized hydrogen zone where br@xmath4 is produced .",
    "the enhancement of the [ feii ] emission to the ne in the redshift channels when compared with the br@xmath4 emission can also be attributed to the interaction of the back wall of the outflow with the far side of the galaxy disc .",
    "the shocks produced in this interaction could provide the energy for the excitation of [ feii ] , besides some contribution from collisions with electrons in the gas heated by x - rays from the agn .",
    "support for the presence of shocks is provided by line ratio maps presented in paper i. towards the borders of the line flux distributions , in particular to the ne border , there is an increase of the [ feii]/pa@xmath14 line ratio to values up to @xmath124 , consistent with shock excitation .",
    "we conclude that the [ feii ] emission can be observed beyond the region where [ oiii ] and h recombination lines can be observed , providing a better coverage of the outflow .",
    "the h@xmath11 emission is detectable mainly in the velocity range @xmath77 to @xmath78  km  s@xmath8 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - channel - map - h2 ] .",
    "the distribution of h@xmath11 flux emission along the velocity channels is very different from that of the [ feii ] and br@xmath4 , indicating that they are tracing distinct gas components and processes .",
    "the strongest emission is detected in the central channels ( around zero velocity ) and exhibits a ring like morphology ( see paper  i and @xcite ) .",
    "the emission of the ring in redshift appears in the velocity channels from @xmath79  km  s@xmath8 to @xmath80  km  s@xmath8 and it comes from the n half of the ring while in the blueshift channels from @xmath41  km  s@xmath8 to @xmath81  km  s@xmath8 the emission comes from the s half of the ring .    in the highest blueshift velocity channel we observe nuclear emission as well as a clump of faint emission distant from the nucleus by @xmath82 at pa  @xmath83 .",
    "the clump is the tip of an elongated emission structure seen in the channels with velocities @xmath84  km  s@xmath8 to @xmath79  km  s@xmath8 , which include the _ northern tongue _ ( nt as in @xcite ) most clearly seen from channel @xmath85  km  s@xmath8 to channel @xmath86  km  s@xmath8 .",

    "this conclusion can also be reached via the analysis of the _ p - v _ diagrams ( sec.[pv_h2 ] ) , in which the ne side of the ring shows mostly redshifts , while the sw side shows blueshifts .",

    "this result indicates that the expansion in the ring has negative acceleration .",
    "this deceleration , showing that the outer border of the ring is not expanding anymore allows to reconcile our previous finding in @xcite , that the h@xmath11 ring is also the site of a young ( age @xmath13 10myr ) stellar population , with the ring kinematics .",
    "if the ring were expanding at constant velocity of @xmath12100  km  s@xmath8 , as previously thought , the 100pc ring would have moved away by much more than 100pc in 10@xmath130yr , and there should be no association anymore between the h@xmath11 ring and star formation originated in this same gas .",
    "hydrodynamic jet simulations by @xcite support the formation of rings of young stellar population in the galaxy disc as a result of shock waves created during the early phases of the jet activity when the jet is still contained inside the galactic disc .",
    "they predict that these rings should have a radius of @xmath12 100  pc .",
    "the ring is formed by the expansion of gas pushed by the shock waves produced by the jet which eventually stop and pile up leading to the formation of the young stars .",
    "the h@xmath11 ring we detected in correspondence to the ring of young stellar population @xcite has the right size and kinematics predicted by the model of @xcite . only that the ring is not centered at the nucleus , as predicted by the model .",

    "there is a better agreement of the model with the data than in the previous two models .",
    "the exceptions are the highest redshift channels ( @xmath184  km  s@xmath8 ) , but , as we already discussed , we have to consider that the outflow is patchy and that most of the sw outflow is hidden behind the galaxy plane .",

    "given the distinct morphology of the [ feii ] as compared to that of the [ oiii ] emitting gas and to that of the conical model , it is remarkable that the conical model previously proposed by @xcite  based on long - slit spectroscopy  gives such a good reproduction of our [ feii ] data , although we have tuned a bit the parameters .",
    "the conical model , however gives a poorer reproduction of the outflowing gas morphology than the lemniscate model as seen in the integrated flux map ( fig .",
    "[ fig - flux - mod-24 ] ) and in the channel maps ( figure 1 of the appendix , available online as a supplementary material ) .",
    "the spherical model fits poorly the data and results in no improvement over the conical model .",
    "the lemniscate model gives a better fit to the flux distribution , but the improvement in the kinematics relative to the conical model is modest : in the _ p - v _ diagrams , the lemniscate model reproduces better the data for the slits that are farthest away from the centre . in the slits closest to the nucleus , there is a  knee \" in the positive velocities at @xmath1312 from the nucleus that is also well reproduced by the lemniscate model .",
    "it may be argued that this model shows a narrower range of velocities than the data , particularly noticeable in the central slits of the _ p - v _ diagrams , but this can be understood as due to the fact that we did not include a velocity dispersion across the walls of the lemniscate . in the conical model ,",
    "such velocity dispersion arises naturally because of the radial symmetry of the model which leads to a varying orientation of the velocity vectors across the walls of the cone , while , in the same region of the lemniscate model the velocity vectors are parallel .",
    "we would like to point out that , even though the geometric distribution of the gas seems to be better reproduced by the lemniscate model , there is no significant difference between the kinematics of the conical and lemniscate models , both providing similar reproduction of the data .",
    "the conical model and the lemniscate model give equally good ( or bad ! ) reproduction of the kinematic data .",
    "this is due to the fact that our modeling did not include all the effects present in the data , only a simple geometry and kinematics for the outflow .",
    "no velocity component due to gas in the disc was considered in the models , even though they seem to be present in the data .",
    "we have also not considered the patchy nature of the outflow , which is obvious in the channel maps , neither the enhanced emission in the redshift channel maps to the ne , as observed in the data .",
    "as we have already pointed out , these latter features are due to the interaction between an accretion disc outflow and the circumnuclear ism of the galaxy . due to the orientation of the outflow relative to the galaxy plane",
    ", the back wall of the ne part of the outflow is tangent to the galaxy plane , encountering much more gas on its way out than the front wall which leaves the plane at a larger angle .",
    "the absence of the effects discussed above in the modelling precludes a quantitative discrimination of the best model to fit the data .",
    "as we have stated above we can only say that the lemniscate model gives a somewhat better reproduction of the line flux distributions .",
    "an additional discriminator between the models could be obtained if the outflow could be probed at larger distances from the nucleus than we have observed , as the models predict distinct morphologies and behaviors in that regions .",
    "the outflow we are seeing on scales of tens to hundreds of parsecs originates in an accretion disc outflow which occurs on scales 23 orders of magnitudes smaller .",
    "we are thus observing the interaction of an agn outflow with the circumnuclear gas at the galaxy .",
    "thus it is remarkable that the observed geometry is so similar to that proposed in accretion disc wind models , such as those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fact that the outflow is hollow supports also an origin in a finite range of radii in the accretion disc as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the only difference between the agn outflow models and the data is the fact that the opening angle of the observed outflow decreases with distance from the nucleus , what seems not to be predicted by the models and may be due to the interaction of the agn outflow and the circumnuclear gas of the galaxy .",
    "it is interesting to note that this feature is observed also in some planetary nebulae ( e.g. ngc6302 and ngc6537 ) .",
    "in order to quantify the mass outflow rate , consider a cross section of the lemniscate perpendicular to the model axis at a distance of 1  arcsec from the nucleus .",

    "* the bi - polar bowl shape geometry ( including the partially ionized gas region ) resembles that of many planetary nebulae and that predicted by disc and torus wind models , supporting that such winds are the origin of the observed outflow . *",
    "the h@xmath11 kinematics is completely distinct from that of the ionized gas , showing an off - centered ring - like morphology at much lower velocities that suggest expansion in the galaxy plane , at an average velocity of @xmath13100kms@xmath8 as supported by previous co mm observations . *",
    "a new result regarding h@xmath11 is our finding of deceleration between the inner and outer border of the ring from @xmath128kms@xmath8 down to zero , which indicates that the expansion is being halted .",
    "this result has been predicted in recent hydrodynamic simulations and can be attributed to the interaction of a nuclear jet with the gas in the galaxy disk .",
    "this gas is pushed radially away from the nucleus and subsequently halted by the circumnuclear ism .",
    "this deceleration reconciles our previous finding of a 10myr stellar population in the ring with its kinematics .",
    "* our measurements also suggest that the two h@xmath11 linear structures nt and st ( to the north and south of the nucleus ) which apparently connect the ring to the galaxy nucleus are in outflow ( contrary to the suggested inflows in previous studies ) .",
    "* we have built models testing three distinct geometries for the outflow observed in [ feii ] : a conical , a spherical and a lemniscate ( hourglass ) . although the lemniscate model gives a better reproduction of the integrated flux distribution , its kinematics does not provide a significantly better reproduction of the velocity field than the conical model of @xcite ; in both models , the outflow is accelerated to a maximum velocity of 1000kms@xmath8 at 80pc from the nucleus , decelerating to zero in the conical model and keeping its maximum velocity constant in the lemniscate model for distances larger than 80pc from the nucleus . *",
    "the calculated mass outflow rate along the nlr is @xmath6m@xmath7yr@xmath8 .",
    "similarly to what we and others have found for other seyfert galaxies , this outflow rate is much larger than the mass accretion rate to the agn , indicating that the observed outflow is in fact gas from the inner region of the galaxy pushed by an agn outflow . *",
    "the calculated power of the outflow is @xmath240  erg  s@xmath8 , which is only @xmath241 , thus smaller than the @xmath242 required to affect significantly the galaxy evolution .",
