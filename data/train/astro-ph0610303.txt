    "the brightness and approximate uniformity of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) enable us to use them as reliable and distant standard candles , and provided evidence for the accelerating universe @xcite . for precision cosmology ,",
    "it is critical to understand the origin of diversity , as well as the explosion mechanism of sne ia that is still open to debate ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "possible sources of diversity include the asymmetry of the explosion @xcite due to the rotation of the progenitor white dwarfs ( wds ) @xcite and/or turbulent behavior of the deflagration flame ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is important to observationally investigate the distribution of the synthesized elements and the kinematical structure of the ejecta in order to constrain the explosion models .    in this respect , late - phase ( @xmath4yr since the explosion ) spectroscopy at near - infrared ( nir )",
    "wavelength provides important diagnostics .",
    "because the ejecta become optically thin in late phases , spectroscopy provides an unbiased , direct view of the innermost regions .",
    "well isolated [ fe ii ]  emission lines at 1.257 and @xmath5 enable us to trace the distribution of the most important isotopes synthesized in sne ia , i.e. , @xmath6ni ( which decays into @xmath6co and then @xmath6fe ) and other iron isotopes such as @xmath7fe .",
    "nir observations of the type ia sn  1991 t show a strongly peaked [ fe ii]@xmath5 line which appears symmetric with respect to the rest - frame of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the nir [ fe ii ]  line profile of sn  1998bu observed by @xcite appears to have a somewhat less centrally - peaked emission profile .",
    "this approach was highlighted by the discovery of a flat - topped [ fe ii ]  @xmath5 emission line in sn 2003du @xcite .",
    "such a line profile requires a central hole in the kinematic distribution of the radioactive ejecta .",
    "this sort of hollow radioactivity distribution is predicted in 1d explosion models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) in which the innermost regions are burned under high densities , @xmath8 , and electron capture produces stable isotopes of @xmath9ni , @xmath7fe , and @xmath6fe , rather than radioactive @xmath6ni .",
    "however , such a distribution is contrary to the predictions of state - of - the - art 3d deflagration simulations which predict large - scale turbulent mixing in the inner layers , and thus do not confine @xmath6ni outside the central core .",
    "the @xcite nir spectrum of sn  2003du also indicate that the [ fe ii ]  1.257 , @xmath5 emission lines show a blueshift of @xmath10 km s@xmath3 with respect to the host galaxy .    however , since the observed sample size of late - phase nir spectra is so small , it is not clear whether the flat - topped and blue - shifted lines are general properties of sne ia .",
    "such observations are extremely difficult because even relatively nearby and bright sne ia are faint in nir at late phases ( e.g. , @xmath11 for sn 2003du at @xmath12 1 year after the explosion ) .",
    "we therefore have conducted nir observations of sne ia using the subaru with oh airglow suppressor ( table 1 ) and obtained 2 more late - phase @xmath13 m spectra of sn 2003hv and 2005w .    detailed explanation and discussion of the spectra will be presented elsewhere ( motohara et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "we briefly report two interesting results in this letter .",
    "( 1 ) the [ fe ii ]  lines of sn  2003hv also show a clear flat - topped feature .",
    "( 2 ) the [ fe ii ]  lines of sn  2005w show less prominent flatness .",
    "( 3 ) a large velocity shift of the line center , varying from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ( km s@xmath3 ) with respect to the host galaxies , exists .    considering the uniformity in optical bands around the peak luminosity ,",
    "the existence of such inhomogeneity and asymmetry in sne ia is surprising , and provides important , new constraints on the explosion models .",
    "sn 2003du was discovered by lotoss on 2003 apr . 22.4 in ugc 9391 at about 15.9mag @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed to be a sn ia by @xcite who reported that the optical spectrum resembles that of sn 2002bo about 2 weeks before maximum , and reached maximum light in the @xmath14-band ( @xmath15 ) on 2003 may 6.3 ut ( jd @xmath16 ) @xcite .    as reported @xcite , @xmath17-band spectroscopy of sn 2003du",
    "was carried out using ohs / cisco @xcite at subaru . for this work ,",
    "we re - reduced the data taken on 2004 feb 27.5 ( @xmath18 ) , which were processed in a standard procedure of flat fielding , sky subtraction , bad - pixel correction , and residual sky subtraction .",
    "the flux was scaled using the @xmath19-band photometry that was taken on 2004 april 2.5 , assuming that the change in the brightness is negligible at the late phase .",
    "wavelength was calibrated using the standard pixel - wavelength relation of cisco , of which the systematic error is estimated to be less than 0.5 pixels ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "sn 2003hv was discovered by lotoss on 2003 sep .",
    "9.5 ( ut ) in ngc 1201 at about 12.5mag @xcite , and confirmed to be a sn ia by the spectrum taken on 2003 sep .",
    "10.4 which resembles that of sn 1994d two days after maximum @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume maximum light in the @xmath14-band to be jd2452891 .",
    "our @xmath17-band spectroscopy of sn 2003hv was carried out using ohs / cisco on 2004 oct 6 ( epoch @xmath21 ) .",
    "the @xmath17-band spectroscopy consists of 6 frames of 2000 sec exposure with an 05 slit , providing a wavelength resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "the a2 star sao 169939 was observed after the target to correct the atmospheric and instrumental absorption pattern .",
    "the data were reduced in the same manner as that of sn 2003du .",
    "sn 2005w was discovered on 2005 feb .",
    "1.4 ( ut ) in ngc 691 at about 15.2mag @xcite , and confirmed to be a sn ia about a week before maximum on 2005 feb 2.7 ( ut ) @xcite .",
    "the expansion velocity is measured to be @xmath23 km s@xmath3 from the si ii line .",
    "we assume maximum light in the @xmath14-band to be 2005 feb 10 ( jd 2453413 ) .",
    "our @xmath17-band spectroscopy of sn 2005w was carried out on 2005 sep 12 ( epoch @xmath24 ) by ohs / cisco .",
    "it consists of 4 frames of 1000 sec exposure with an @xmath25 slit .",
    "the a2 star hip 20091 was observed after the target to correct the atmospheric and instrumental absorption pattern .",
    "the data were reduced in the same manner as that of sn  2003du .",
    "the nir spectra are shown in figure [ specall ] .",
    "it can be seen that all the observed sne ia exhibit strong [ fe ii ]  @xmath26 and @xmath5 lines .",
    "we discovered two important features .",
    "first , the line center of [ fe ii ] , corrected for the redshift of the host galaxies , is not identical for the three events . with respect to the rest wavelength of the line ( @xmath5 ) , 2 sne ia ( 2003du , 2003hv )",
    "show a blueshift , while the other sn ( 2005w ) shows a redshift .",
    "the corresponding velocity shifts relative to the hosts rest frame are @xmath27 km s@xmath3 , @xmath28 km s@xmath3 , and @xmath29 km s@xmath3 , for sne 2003hv , 2003du , and 2005w , respectively .",
    "such a velocity shift is confirmed by a mid - infrared(mir ) spectrum of sn 2003hv taken by the irs / spitzer space telescope at @xmath30 after maximum brightness ( fig .",
    "[ modelfithv ] ; gerardy et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "one of the strongest emission features is identified as the ground - state fine - structure line of [ co iii ]  at @xmath31 ( a@xmath32f@xmath33 - a@xmath32f@xmath34 ) .",
    "the well - isolated [ co iii ]  line also shows a velocity shift which is consistent with that seen in the nir [ fe ii ]  @xmath5 line , to within the noise level of the mir feature .    secondly , we find that the observed [ fe ii ]  lines show a large variety in their shape ( figure  [ specall ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of sn 2003hv clearly shows a flat - topped boxy profile like that seen at much lower @xmath35 in sn 2003du .",
    "indeed , the higher @xmath35 of the sn 2003hv spectrum places a much stronger constraint on the flatness of the core of the [ fe ii ]  line . in contrast , the [ fe ii ]  line profile of sn 2005w shows no evidence of a central flat top .",
    "the boxy profile of [ fe ii ]  lines seen in sn 2003du and sn 2003hv suggests the absence of radioactive @xmath6ni  below @xmath36 km s@xmath3 ( measured from the center of the @xmath6ni  distribution ) .",
    "we note that the observed epoch of sn 2003hv is more advanced than sn 2003du . at a later epoch",
    ", the line profile should follow the @xmath6ni  distribution more closely (  4 ) . effects of possible line deformation due to electron and line scatterings will also effectively vanish .",
    "the present result of sn 2003hv confirms the existence of the @xmath6ni - empty hole more strongly than that of sn 2003du .",
    "in this section we discuss the impact of our findings for understanding the explosion mechanism .",
    "it is widely agreed that the explosion of a sn ia starts from a deflagration @xcite . in the spherical deflagration models ,",
    "electron capture leads to the synthesis of @xmath9ni , @xmath7fe , and @xmath6fe ( not via @xmath6ni decay ) , thus creating an almost @xmath6ni - empty hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in multi - d models , the ignition of the deflagration may be off - center , producing a non - spherical burning region @xcite . in some cases",
    ", the deflagration to detonation transition ( ddt ) may occur ( delayed detonation models : * ? ? ?",
    "the ddt may also take place non - spherically @xcite even if the deflagration does not have bulk kinematical offset .",
    "the flat - topped [ fe ii ]  nir lines in sne 2003hv and 2003du indicate that the highest density region occupied by neutron - rich fe - peak isotopes is not mixed with the surrounding region where the dominant isotope is @xmath6ni  @xcite .",
    "figure [ modelfithv ] shows a spectrum for the spherical deflagration explosion model w7 ( nomoto et al .",
    "1984 ) at @xmath37 since the explosion , compared with that of sn 2003hv .",
    "this is calculated by solving transport of @xmath38-rays produced in the decay chain @xmath6ni  @xmath39 @xmath6co  @xmath39 @xmath6fe   and iteratively solving nlte rate equations @xcite .",
    "positrons produced by the @xmath6co - decay are assumed to be trapped on the spot , since the mean free path of positrons is expected to be small at this epoch @xcite .",
    "the model shows that the flat - topped profile is consistent with the [ fe ii ]  @xmath5 emission for the reason as described above .",
    "the asymmetry in the profile , mildly peaking in the red , is due to the weak contributions of [ fe ii ]  @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the shift of [ fe ii ]  lines suggests that the distribution of @xmath6ni  ( which decays to @xmath6fe  via @xmath6co ) produced at the explosion is asymmetric , showing the bulk kinematical offset of @xmath42 km s@xmath3 with respect to the sn rest frame .",
    "this suggests that , unlike the spherical models , the carbon ignition may take place off - center .",
    "the flat - topped [ fe ii ]  line profiles suggest that electron capture in the high density off - center deflagration region creates the neutron - rich hole as in 1d models , at least in sne 2003du and 2003hv .",
    "the neutron - rich hole is offset along with the bulk @xmath6nidistribution .",
    "this indicates that the highest density burning in these sne took place quite far away from the center of the progenitor star .",
    "the blueshifted and flat - topped profile of [ fe ii ]  can also be reproduced by symmetric and opaque dusty core , like [ o i ]  @xmath43 observed in late phase type ii sn @xcite .",
    "if this is the case in the present results , mir [ co iii ]  line , which will be far less affected by dust extinction , may show much smaller blueshift than nir [ fe ii ] .",
    "however , the [ co iii ]  line shows almost same blueshift as [ fe ii ]  ( fig .",
    "[ modelfithv ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the flat - topped profile is caused by the opaque dust core .    adding the result of sn 1991 t @xcite",
    ", 2 sne ( sn 2003du , sn 2003hv ) out of 4 sne ia show the boxy [ fe ii ]  profile ( figure [ specall ] ) , while sn1991 t and sn 2005w do not .",
    "this could indicate that the distribution of @xmath6ni in the innermost region of the sn ia explosion might differ from object to object .",
    "sne ia with a non - boxy line profile might experience more mixing than those with a boxy profile ( e.g. , sn 2003hv ) in the innermost region .",
    "another possibility is that the density of the progenitor where the ignition takes place differs from object to object , and sn ia with the peaked [ fe ii ]  explodes at a low density so as not to produce electron capture isotopes .",
    "alternatively , the different line shape could be due to an age effect , i.e. , due to a variation in the extent to which the energy deposition from the radioactivity is kept local . at earlier epochs , @xmath38-rays are the dominant heating source . since the @xmath38-ray penetration is not a local process , the innermost region , even without @xmath6ni  there , can be heated effectively . at later epochs ,",
    "contribution from the local positron energy input becomes larger , and the line profile should follow the @xmath6ni  distribution more closely . therefore , we expect that the line shape could evolve from a peaked to a flat - topped profile .",
    "this may partially explain the fact that the most aged sn ia 2003hv shows the clean flat - topped boxy [ fe ii ]  line .",
    "indeed , this provides an observational test of our model .",
    "we suggest a future test to estimate the age effect and confirm our interpretation of the @xmath6ni : a temporal series of nir nebular spectra for an individual sn ia .",
    "the shape of [ fe ii ]  line is expected to start getting flat at @xmath44 , and may become totally flat at @xmath45 .",
    "thereafter , it may start showing a peaked profile at @xmath46 again , depending on the amount of positrons that can escape the ejecta @xcite .",
    "also , spectra at different wavelengths from optical to the mir will be useful to investigate the distribution of different ions and heating radioactive isotopes ( e.g. , figure [ modelfithv ] ) .",
    "because the line profiles from different ions and from different energy levels are dependent on the ionization and thermal structure of the ejecta , further detailed theoretical study is necessary to make use of these observations efficiently .",
