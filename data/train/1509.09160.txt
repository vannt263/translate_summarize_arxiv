    "formal deformation quantization as introduced in @xcite has reached a remarkable state where the existence and the classification of formal star products is by now understood very well : kontsevich s formality theorem gives both , the general existence of formal star products on poisson manifolds as well as their classification up to equivalence . in the symplectic case",
    ", earlier results gave the existence @xcite as well as the classification @xcite .",
    "beside the symplectic situation , the linear poisson structures , i.e. the kirillov - kostant - souriau bracket on the dual of a lie algebra @xmath1 , remained the only example which allowed a formal deformation quantization for a long time : the existence of a star product on @xmath2 is contained in the construction of gutt @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the construction is rather simple .",
    "the algebra of polynomial functions on @xmath2 is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra @xmath0 which is , as filtered vector space , isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra @xmath3 via the poincar - birkhoff - witt theorem . taking the canonical pbw isomorphism , i.e. the total symmetrization map , one can pull - back the product of @xmath3 to obtain a product on @xmath0 and hence on @xmath4 .",
    "taking into account the degrees of the polynomials in the right way allows to plug in a deformation parameter @xmath5 such that one ends up with a star product @xmath6 on @xmath2 .",
    "this star product has many remarkable features , one of them is that it converges for trivial reasons on the polynomial functions @xmath4 for all @xmath5 .",
    "this is clear by the very construction . from the quantization point of view , @xmath5 is something like @xmath7 with @xmath8 being planck s constant .    in general , formal star products",
    "are very hard to control from an analytic point of view : not much is known about the convergence properties of the formal power series .",
    "the reason is rather simple : in a formal star product the number of involved derivatives of the two factors is typically equal or higher as the power of the deformation parameter : hence the classical borel lemma allows to construct smooth functions for which the star product has radius of convergence zero .",
    "the interesting question is of course whether one can find a reasonable subalgebra where the star product has a nontrivial radius of convergence .",
    "beside very few examples , related to the weyl - moyal product @xcite and the khler structure on the poincar disk @xcite , not much is known in this direction . alternatively , there are various approaches to strict deformation quantization based on integral formulas for the deformed product .",
    "the formal star product then arises as asymptotic expansion of the integrals . here",
    "we refer to e.g. @xcite as well as to @xcite . however , the usage of integral formulas bounds these approaches to finite dimensions whereas a direct investigation of the convergence of series may still be applicable in infinite dimensions as needed for ( quantum ) field - theoretic models .    in this paper",
    "we want to add yet another example where the convergence of a formal star product can be controlled in an efficient way : the gutt star product on @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , our construction will work even in some infinite - dimensional cases .",
    "therefore we need a slight reformulation to incorporate these situations , too : instead of the polynomial functions we focus on the symmetric algebra @xmath0 of the lie algebra .",
    "in finite dimensions this will make no difference but in infinite dimensions , @xmath0 only injects into @xmath4 but is strictly smaller .",
    "since the gutt star product on @xmath0 can be constructed in any dimension , this seems to be a reasonable framework .",
    "our basic idea is now to establish a locally convex topology on @xmath0 in such a way that the gutt star product becomes continuous .",
    "then it automatically extends to the completion which we want to be as large as possible .",
    "however , we want the completion to be small enough so that its elements are still functions on the ( topological ) dual @xmath9 of @xmath1 .",
    "this requires the evaluation functionals on points in @xmath9 to be continuous . while in finite dimensions this will work for all lie algebras equally well , in infinite dimensions we have to add some technical continuity properties on the lie bracket of @xmath1 .    in the following ,",
    "we consider a locally convex lie algebra @xmath1 over @xmath10 or @xmath11 , i.e. a real or complex locally convex topological vector space with a continuous lie bracket .",
    "we focus on a honestly continuous lie bracket instead of a separately continuous one throughout this work .",
    "this means that for every continuous seminorm @xmath12 there exists another continuous seminorm @xmath13 such that for all @xmath14 one has @xmath15 )      \\leq      q(\\xi ) q(\\eta).\\ ] ] for our study of the gutt star product , this will not be enough , since we will have to control an arbitrarily high number of nested brackets without getting a new seminorm for each bracket .",
    "thus , we will need an estimate which does not depend on the number of lie brackets implied .",
    "this motivates the following definition , see also @xcite :    [ def : ae ] let @xmath16 be a hausdorff locally convex algebra ( not necessarily associative ) with @xmath17 denoting the multiplication , and let @xmath12 be a continuous seminorm .",
    "[ item : asymptoticestimate ] a continuous seminorm @xmath13 is said to be an asymptotic estimate for @xmath12 , if @xmath18 for all words @xmath19 made out of @xmath20 products of the elements @xmath21 with arbitrary position of placing brackets .",
    "[ item : aealgebra ] a locally convex algebra is said to be an asymptotic estimate algebra ( ae - algebra ) , if every continuous seminorm has an asymptotic estimate .",
    "we are mainly interested in the case of an ae - lie algebra but of course also associative ae - algebras are of interest . given an associative ae - algebra its commutator lie algebra is a ae - lie algebra .",
    "also , all finite - dimensional lie algebras are ae - lie algebras .",
    "more generally , all _ locally multiplicatively convex _ algebras are of this type , i.e. those where one finds a defining set of continuous seminorms @xmath12 such that @xmath22 for all algebra elements @xmath23",
    ". clearly , all finite - dimensional lie algebras are locally multiplicatively convex .    in order to formulate our continuity results we have to specify the topology on @xmath24 . here",
    "we rely on the results of @xcite , where a definition for a locally convex topology on the tensor algebra @xmath25 of a locally convex vector space @xmath26 was given : given @xmath27 , one can define the locally convex vector spaces @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the symmetric tensor algebra viewed as subspace of the tensor algebra .",
    "the basic idea is to control the growth of tensor powers of a seminorm @xmath31 applied to the homogeneous tensor parts of degree @xmath32 by the @xmath33-th power of @xmath34 .",
    "there were also definitions given for the projective limits @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we will define those spaces more precisely in section  [ sec : prelim ] . using this topology on the symmetric algebra",
    ", we can now state the main results :    [ theorem : maintheoremi ] let @xmath1 be an ae - lie algebra and let @xmath37 .",
    "the gutt star product @xmath6 is continuous with respect to the @xmath38-topology for every @xmath39 .",
    "the completion @xmath40 becomes a locally convex hopf algebra with respect to the gutt star product and the undeformed coproduct , antipode , and counit .",
    "the gutt star product is convergent as series in @xmath41 .",
    "the construction is functorial for continuous lie algebra homomorphisms .",
    "[ theorem : maintheoremii ] let @xmath1 be a nilpotent locally convex lie algebra .",
    "then the statement of main theorem  [ theorem : maintheoremi ] holds for all @xmath37 and for the projective limit @xmath42 .",
    "remarkably , in the general case of main theorem  [ theorem : maintheoremi ] , the completion will _ not _ contain the exponentials of elements in @xmath1 : this is in some sense to be expected as otherwise the product of two such exponentials would again be defined as an element of the completion .",
    "this way , one would be able to reconstruct a convergent bch series for all elements in @xmath1 , which is known to be impossible .",
    "however , in the nilpotent case , we have the exponentials inside the completion .",
    "of course , this matches well with the fact that the bch series is non - problematic in this case .",
    "[ remark : finitedimcases ] in the finite - dimensional case one can directly consider the universal enveloping algebra and establish topologies on it .",
    "the analogous topology to our @xmath38-topology has been used and investigated by @xcite and @xcite . from that point of view ,",
    "our results can be seen as a generalization to the possibly infinite - dimensional case including the much more involved proofs for the ae lie algebra case . the strategy in @xcite",
    "is based very much on the fact that in finite - dimensions one has a banach - lie algebra .",
    "moreover , the topology is obtained by a quotient procedure starting with the @xmath43-topology on the tensor algebra and proving that the ideal generated by the lie relations is actually closed in order to give a hausdorff topology on the universal enveloping algebra .",
    "what is missing is of course the continuity of the coefficient maps @xmath44 of the gutt star product since there is only the filtration of the universal enveloping algebra but not the grading of the symmetric algebra available .",
    "this makes the question on analytic dependence on a deformation parameter meaningless : at the time of @xcite and @xcite the notion of star products was not yet commonly known .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : prelim ] we first outline the construction of the locally convex topologies on the tensor algebra and the symmetric algebra according to @xcite .",
    "then we recall the basic construction of the gutt star product and provide several equivalent descriptions .",
    "the most useful for our purposes is the one based on the baker - campbell - hausdorff series @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : lctopolgy ] contains the heart of this work : we establish the continuity of the gutt star product with respect to the @xmath38-topology for @xmath37 .",
    "the first approach works for general asymptotic estimate lie algebras .",
    "we also include a second and easier proof which , however , works only in the locally multiplicatively convex case . then we show that we in fact obtain an entire deformation enjoying good functorial properties with respect to continuous lie algebra homomorphisms .",
    "section  [ sec : nilpotent ] is devoted to the nilpotent case .",
    "here we can improve the previous continuity statements to the projective limit @xmath45 since the bch series has significantly less terms in this situation .",
    "the completion will now include exponential functions . in section  [ sec : hopf ] we show the continuity of the remaining hopf algebra maps .",
    "this is now much simpler as they are the classical maps not depending on the deformation parameter @xmath5 .",

    "let @xmath434 and @xmath435 , then we can actually simplify the calculations by @xmath436 where in we rearranged the factorials in ( @xmath124 ) and used @xmath437 .",
    "the estimates ( @xmath125 ) are the standard binomial coefficient estimates . in ( @xmath221 )",
    "we used @xmath431 .",
    "now we just use @xmath438 and the infimum argument to expand this estimate to all tensors .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "in a last step we investigate the continuity of the hopf algebra structure maps on @xmath317 . pulling back the coproduct @xmath439 and the antipode @xmath440 from @xmath317 to @xmath0 we",

    "it is well - known that @xmath441 and @xmath442 are independent of @xmath5 and coincide with the classical shuffle coproduct and antipode which on the symmetric algebra can be written as follows :    [ thm : hopf : formulas ] for @xmath443 we have the identities @xmath444 and @xmath445 where @xmath446 denotes the symmetric tensor product of all @xmath179 with @xmath447 and @xmath448 means that the @xmath179 with @xmath447 are left out .",
    "we need a topology on the tensor product in , for which we take again the projective tensor product .",
    "the continuity of the two maps is now easy to prove .",
    "in fact , it does not refer to the lie structure at all and holds in full generality :    [ prop : hopf : coproductcontinuity ] let @xmath26 be a locally convex vector space and let @xmath213 . for every continuous seminorm @xmath12 and all @xmath449 the following estimates hold : @xmath450 and",

    ", we compute it on factorizing tensors : @xmath452 this extends to all tensors by the infimum argument and restricts to the symmetric algebra afterwards .    since the continuity of the unit and the counit @xmath453 is clear by the definition of our topology , we have the following result .",
    "[ prop : hopf : continuoushopf ] let @xmath1 be an ae - lie algebra and @xmath409 . then ,",
    "if @xmath216 , @xmath454 is a topological hopf algebra .",
    "the same holds for @xmath455 , if @xmath1 is a nilpotent locally convex lie algebra with continuous lie bracket .",
    "the two main theorems allow us to make some observations , which also go beyond deformation quantization .",
    "we found a locally convex topology on the universal enveloping algebra and encountered a special class of ae(-lie ) algebras .",
    "it is worth looking at those two issues more closely .",
    "the term asymptotic estimate has , to the best of our knowledge , first been used by boseck , czichowski and rudolph in @xcite . their definition of an ae - algebra differs from ours since not just one but a whole series of asymptotic estimates has to exist for every seminorm .",
    "this series has to fulfil two technical properties .",
    "this is not the case in our definition , which is , in general , weaker .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , glckner and neeb use a property to which they referred as ( @xmath456 ) for associative algebras .",
    "this was then used in @xcite by bogfjellmo and dahmen and schmedig , who called it the @xmath457-property .",
    "it is easy to see that it is equivalent to being ae .",
    "as we already know , there are a lot of examples of these structures , like @xmath458-algebras , banach algebras and more generally : locally multiplicatively convex algebras .",
    "recall that a locally convex algebra ( either associative or lie ) is called _ locally multiplicatively convex _ if there exists a defining system of seminorms such that for all seminorms @xmath12 of this system one has @xmath459 for all @xmath460 .",
    "clearly , this implies .",
    "the associative locally multiplicatively convex algebras have been discussed in detail by michael @xcite .",
    "clearly , finite - dimensional ( lie ) algebras are banach and hence locally multiplicatively convex .",
    "also , all nilpotent locally convex ( lie ) algebras belong to this category , since one just needs to take the maximum of a finite number of seminorms .",
    "so far , we did not find an example for an ae(-lie ) algebra , which was neither locally multiplicatively convex nor nilpotent and it seems to be a non - trivial question , whether such an algebra exists at all .",
    "are there ae(-lie ) algebras , which are not already locally multiplicatively convex or nilpotent ?    in some special cases , however , we can give an answer to this question : every associative ae algebra admits an entire holomorphic calculus in the following sense : let @xmath16 be a complete associative ae algebra and let @xmath461 be an entire function , then for every @xmath462 and every continuous seminorm @xmath12 with asymptotic estimate @xmath13 we have @xmath463 thus @xmath464 is defined for every @xmath228 and every entire function @xmath465 , obeying the usual rules of a functional calculus . in this sense , @xmath16 behaves very much like a locally multiplicatively convex algebra .",
    "if in addition , @xmath16 is commutative and frchet , we get an answer to our question by using a result @xcite due to mitiagin , rolewicz and elazko .",
    "they showed that an associative , commutative frchet algebra admitting an entire calculus _ is _ actually locally multiplicatively convex .    for non - commutative algebras",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "there are associative frchet algebras admitting an entire holomorphic calculus which are not locally multiplicatively convex . in @xcite , elazko gave an example of such an algebra . however , his example is also not ae .    in the lie case ,",
    "not much seems to be known about the relation between ae - lie algebras and locally multiplicatively convex lie algebras .",
    "we also imposed a locally convex topology on the universal enveloping algebra @xmath466 , since we can just pull back the topology on @xmath238 with the poincar - birkhoff - witt isomorphism .",
    "it is not the only one on @xmath466 which is reasonable : in @xcite schottenloher and pflaum mention another locally convex topology in the case of a finite - dimensional lie algebra , which we will call @xmath467 for now .",
    "they take the coarsest locally convex topology , such that all finite - dimensional representations of @xmath1 extend to continuous algebra homomorphisms .",
    "this topology is in fact even locally multiplicatively convex and therefore different from ours .",
    "it is easy to show , that our topology is finer .",
    "[ thm : lcana : continuousrepresentations ] let @xmath216 and @xmath468 the universal enveloping algebra of a finite - dimensional lie algebra @xmath1 , then the @xmath38-topology is strictly finer than @xmath467 .    from corollary  [ coro : lcana :",
    "continuousrepresentations ] we know that if @xmath1 is finite - dimensional , all finite - dimensional representations will extend to continuous algebra homomorphisms . since @xmath467 was the coarsest topology such that this is the case , the @xmath38-topology must be finer .",
    "it is strictly finer , since the @xmath38-topology does not have an entire calculus for @xmath216 and can hence not be locally multiplicatively convex .    for representations on infinite - dimensional banach or hilbert spaces , the statement is less important , since there one rarely has norm - continuous representations , but merely strongly continuous ones .",
    "[ rem : lcanabchconvergence ] one could argue , that a topology which is locally multiplicatively convex is much more useful than a `` just locally convex '' one . of course , submultiplicativity of the seminorms allows for more constructions like an entire calculus , but there are good reasons why the @xmath38-topology also has its advantages : first of all , it is also defined for infinite - dimensional lie algebras with reasonable functorial properties .",
    "second , the topology build upon representations does not allow to have a continuous deformation of @xmath469 , at least in a similar way : the canonical projections @xmath470 from proposition  [ proposition : projections ] can be shown to be discontinuous with respect to @xmath467 . for @xmath311 , @xmath471 and @xmath472 being the projection onto the lie algebra itself , we get @xmath473 if we assume the product and the projection to be convergent . with respect to @xmath467 , the exponential series @xmath474 exists for all @xmath270 and",
    "therefore the baker - campbell - hausdorff series must exist for all @xmath14 .",
    "since this is not the case in a generic lie algebra , we get a contradiction .",
    "first we note that it is just a matter of collecting signs to extend our results to super lie algebras . here",
    "the analysis part is robust enough as the signs will not alter the estimates .",
    "we do not formulate the details here .",
    "more interesting is the application of our result to deformation quantization , say in finite dimensions for simplicity .",
    "while the gutt star product itself may be seen as yet rather simple , it encodes quantizations of coadjoint orbits : from @xcite one knows that the gutt star product does not just restrict to coadjoint orbits in general , even though there are interesting exceptional cases . for these cases",
    ", we immediately get convergent star products on coadjoint orbits :    [ theorem : quantizecoadjointorbits ] let @xmath102 be a finite - dimensional lie group with lie algebra @xmath1 and @xmath475 a coadjoint orbit to which the gutt star product is tangential",
    ". then the gutt star product restricts to a continuous star product on @xmath476 .",
    "here we use now that @xmath477 can be identified with the polynomial functions @xmath478 on @xmath2 . now since the evaluation functionals at points in @xmath2 are continuous by proposition  [ proposition : projections ] , , the vanishing ideal of the orbit is a closed subspace of @xmath477 .",
    "since we assume that the gutt star product is tangential , it is also a two - sided ideal with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "thus , on the one hand , the quotient inherits the product and , on the other hand , it inherits a hausdorff locally convex topology for which the product is continuous .",
    "we then can complete again to get a holomorphic deformation of those functions on the orbit which are obtained by restricting functions on @xmath2 in the completion of @xmath4 with respect to the @xmath38-topology to the orbit .",
    "however , even if the gutt star product is not tangential , there is some hope to get a star product on coadjoint orbits for which the convergence can be controlled : in ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.2 ) a construction of a deformed restriction map @xmath479 of functions on @xmath2 to functions on a coadjoint orbit @xmath480 was given , provided the lie algebra @xmath1 is compact and the orbit is regular .",
    "it will be left to a future project to investigate the behaviour of the deformed restriction map with respect to polynomial functions and their @xmath38-topology . beside this fairly general construction",
    ", it seems also plausible to generalize the restriction procedure to particular other cases .",
    "since we used the results from proposition  [ proposition : pbwguttdrinfeldbchwhoelsestarproduct ] and proposition  [ proposition : deformedliealgebrastarproduct ] , we need to give a proof that that they hold for any ( also infinite - dimensional ) lie algebra @xmath1 . to avoid any possible confusion ,",
    "we define three different star products .",
    "[ def : threestarproducts ] let @xmath1 be a lie algebra and @xmath409 .",
    "then we define the gutt star product @xmath6 via , the deformed pbw star product @xmath481 via and the drinfeld star product @xmath482 via .",
    "we need to prove that all of them are identical .",
    "therefore , it is enough to show that they coincide on @xmath483 for @xmath14 and any @xmath188 , since those terms generate the whole algebra .",
    "we get equality for @xmath484 by polarization and then for @xmath485 by iteration .",
    "recall that we have @xmath486 if @xmath311 from the construction , since @xmath487 . in proposition",
    "[ proposition : guttstaronelinearfactor ] we have sketched the proof of a formula for @xmath482 : @xmath488 we first show @xmath489 .          we need the identities @xmath496 which are easy to check .",
    "since the map @xmath119 is linear , we can pull out the constants and get @xmath497 now we just have to use the two equalities to get @xmath498 and collect the terms for which we have @xmath499 .",
    "we need some standard identities on binomial coefficients and the recursive definition of the bernoulli numbers . besides that",
