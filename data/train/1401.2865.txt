    "<S> the wide controllability of these systems allow experimentalists to prepare different kinds of non - equilibrium initial states and it is also possible to study the dynamics with time resolution unreachable in other physical systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some of the main questions are when and how thermalization , or more generally equilibration , occurs and their connection to ergodicity and integrability . </S>",
    "<S> these were first posed by j. von neumann already in 1929 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - equilibrium time evolution can be characterized by many different ways , borrowing ideas from equilibrium statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the ultrashort time non - equilibrium dynamics , revealing the role of high - energy excitations , is also of interest as well as the stationary state reached after long time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this latter can be described by the diagonal ensemble , which is roughly the time averaged density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the results of local measurements can be described by simpler ensembles , i.e. by the thermal gibbs ensemble for non integrable ( ergodic ) systems @xcite and by the generalized gibbs ensemble for integrable ones @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the loschmidt overlap ( lo ) , which is the main focus of this paper , is a nonlocal expression and is entirely determined by the diagonal ensemble , hence it characterizes the stationary state @xcite . analyzing the lo proved to be useful in studying quantum chaos , decoherence and quantum criticality @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite pointed out a similarity between the time evolution of the lo overlap and the equilibrium phase transitions ( epts ) . </S>",
    "<S> close to phase transitions the free energy density is non analytical function of the temperature . a method proposed by fisher @xcite to analyze the zeros of the partition function in the _ complex temperature plane _ gives a good understanding of these non - analyticities . in a finite system phase transitions can not occur , and the fisher - zeros are isolated and do not lie on the real axis . however , in the thermodynamic limit they coalesce into lines ( or in general case areas @xcite ) that can cross the real axis . </S>",
    "<S> these crossings are responsible for the breakdown of the analytic continuation of the free energy density as a function of temperature : knowing the free energy above the transition temperature does not give any informations about the free energy below .    </S>",
    "<S> the lo in eq . is formally similar to the canonical partition function with imaginary temperature . for a large system @xmath3 scales exponentially with the system size , </S>",
    "<S> hence it is worthwhile to study the dynamical free energy @xcite , which we define as @xmath4 under certain circumstances this quantity shows non - analytical time - evolution . due to the similarities with the ept , the notion _ dynamical phase transitions _ </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that in the transverse field ising chain the dpts and epts are ultimately related : the time evolution of @xmath3 becomes non - analytic whenever the magnetic field is quenched through the ( equilibrium ) critical value . </S>",
    "<S> similar observations were made for non - integrable models  @xcite and for complex magnetic fields @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to show that this connection is not rigorous . to this aim </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the anisotropic xy chain in transverse magnetic field and show that generally dpts can occur in quenches within the same phase , i.e. without crossing any equilibrium phase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> note that a numerical evidence for this phenomenon was reported recently in refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also present a counter - example where the quench crosses an equilibrium critical point , but the lo remains analytic .    </S>",
    "<S> the xy hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions reads as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the anisotropy parameter and the homogeneous external magnetic field , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> this hamiltonian conserves the parity of the particle number and acts differently on the even and odd subspaces ( sometimes referred to as neveu - schwarz or ramond sectors ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian in the two subspaces are formally the same if we impose antiperiodic boundary condition for the even and periodic boundary condition for the odd subspace . in wavenumber space </S>",

    "<S> though the asymptotic behaviour of the bogoliubov angles are similar to the @xmath67 case , there is an interesting difference as well : there are no fisher zeros in the vicinity of the imaginary axis . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath32 is not continuous at @xmath68 , therefore @xmath69 . </S>",

    "<S> as we approach the xx line the slope of @xmath32 diverges at @xmath71 , hence the density of fisher zeros vanish near the imaginary axis . </S>",
    "<S> as opposed to previous examples , when the initial and final hamiltonians lied in the gapped phase , quenching to the xx line is a special case because the final parameters are on a critical line . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it is still surprising that for quenches @xmath65 dpts occur everywhere except for the boundary of these regions .    </S>",
    "<S> however , non analytical behaviour in the dynamical free energy can be observed in quenches to the critical lines as well . </S>",
    "<S> one example is a quench from i or iii to the xx line : @xmath72 with @xmath73 . in this case </S>",

    "<S> the other example , which we only mention here , is a quench crossing a critical line @xcite : starting from @xmath66 to the @xmath76 critical boundary of @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ quench from phase i to iii_. in this case the anisotropy parameter is quenched from positive to negative values in low magnetic field ( @xmath77 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the system goes through an anisotropy transition at @xmath42 . at @xmath78 </S>",

    "<S> for these quenches @xmath82 meaning that the fisher lines start and end at the left half plane </S>",
    "<S> . however , there is wavenumber @xmath83 defined by @xmath84 , for which @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that while @xmath31 goes through the interval @xmath86 the fisher lines come from @xmath87 , reach @xmath88 at @xmath71 and finally go back to @xmath87 again ( fig.[fig : fisherline]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence all the fisher lines cross the imaginary axis twice giving rise to two emergent timescales in the dynamical free energy ( fig.[fig : dynfree_magn]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is qualitative difference between the quenches i to ii and i to iii .    for epts , </S>",
    "<S> the non - analyticity of the free energy is also imprinted in the non - analytic behaviour of other physical quantities , e.g. the order parameter or its susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> a similar phenomenon is expected to occur for the dpts as well  @xcite . for the xy model , </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium order parameter is the magnetization in the xy plane . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we determined its absolute value for the non - equilibrium situation by numerical evaluation of pfaffians @xcite . whenever the fisher line crosses the imaginary axis once , only a single emergent non - equilibrium timescale appears from the dynamical free energy , which matches exactly that of the magnetization </S>",
    "<S> however , for quenches @xmath74 and @xmath75 each fisher line crosses the imaginary axis twice which implies two non equilibrium timescales . only these two timescales and their higher harmonics ( in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it is an important question whether the non analytic behaviour is present in quenches starting from polarized states or not . for quenches through the critical point in the transverse field ising model it has been shown that dpts can be observed , but the non - analyticities are not at the fisher - times of the parity subspaces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found similar behaviour in the xy model @xcite .    though we calculated the lo and the dynamical free energy directly from the time evolution of the initial wave function , they describe the stationary state after the quench @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , as the time evolution operator is diagonal in the eigenbasis of @xmath2 , @xmath3 depends only on the diagonal elements of the density matrix : @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the diagonal ensemble . </S>",
