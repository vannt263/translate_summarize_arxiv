    "we address the question of how the dynamics of quantum systems on curved space  times can be described in a physically motivated and mathematically useful manner in the special case of a class of robertson  walker space  times . in the literature known to us",
    ", the general question is broached either for free fields or in some quasi - classical approximation .",
    "we would like to give a purely quantum field - theoretic treatment which is valid also for interacting quantum fields .",
    "we do so in the language of algebraic quantum field theory@xcite , which , though not widely known , has the advantages of being conceptually broad enough to subsume within it most approaches to quantum field theory and yet being mathematically rigorous .",
    "corresponding to the operationally motivated nature of algebraic quantum field theory , we begin our considerations with the worldline of an observer .",
    "this moving observer is subject to various forces  if his worldline is a geodesic , these forces are purely gravitational ; otherwise , he is subject to acceleration due to non - gravitational causes .",
    "the same is true if the worldline is that of a quantum system , subject now to forces on the quantum level . what would be a suitable , mathematically rigorous description of the attendant dynamics of this system ?",
    "we propose an answer to that question , at least for quantum systems on a large class of robertson  walker space  times , which includes de sitter space . in section 2 , we shall specify the class of robertson  walker space  times we shall be considering . for all of these space ",
    "times , the local conformal group is @xmath0 .",
    "we show that given an arbitrary worldline in such a space  time , two physically motivated assumptions allow us to find a unique curve in @xmath0 which generates the worldlines of the given system and neighboring systems .",
    "these considerations are purely geometrical in nature .",
    "quantum theory enters for the first time in section 3 , where we describe quantum systems on our class of robertson  walker space  times using nets of local observable algebras supplied with a state .",
    "we define there what we mean by covariant , respectively quasi - covariant , dynamics of such systems .",
    "this will involve continuous 2-parameter families of automorphisms of the global observable algebra satisfying canonical propagator identities , which implement the action of the curve in @xmath0 associated with the evolution of the initial worldline , and which act locally on the observables in a well motivated manner .    in section 4 , we shall use results from a previous paper @xcite to construct nets and states on the specified robertson  walker space  times which admit dynamics in the sense of section 3 .",
    "we provide examples which admit covariant dynamics , as well as examples which only admit quasi - covariant dynamics .",
    "the transplanted state will be shown to be passive in an appropriate sense for this dynamics , so that for this dynamics the state behaves like a local equilibrium state from which cyclic processes can not extract energy .    in the final section",

    "the corresponding spatial direction is a unit vector in @xmath325 , which we denote by @xmath326 as is well known , the motion of the gyroscope axis corresponds to the fermi ",

    "i.e.  _ its direction at time @xmath6 then corresponds to @xmath327 on the other hand , the direction of our measurement device at time @xmath6 corresponds , by assumption ( a ) , to the projection of @xmath328 onto @xmath329  @xcite . but as a consequence of equation  , the latter coincides with @xmath328 .",
    "hence , assumption ( b ) implies that @xmath330 on @xmath331 since the fermi  walker transport also acts on @xmath332 like @xmath288 ( see equation  ) , we have shown that ( a ) and ( b ) imply @xmath330 , @xmath315 .",
