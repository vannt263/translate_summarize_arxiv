    "expansiveness plays an important role in the exploitation of hyperbolicity in smooth dynamical systems , and in complex dynamics in particular ( see for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .    in the context of continuous maps on compact metric spaces , there are two weaker notions of expansion , called _ @xmath1-expansiveness _ and _ asymptotic @xmath1-expansiveness _ , introduced by r.  bowen @xcite and m.  misiurewicz @xcite , respectively .",

    "see section  [ subsctasymhexpconcepts ] for details .",
    "another way to formulate forward expansiveness is via distance expansion .",
    "we say that @xmath9 is _ distance - expanding _",

    "conversely , if @xmath14 is distance - expanding , then it is forward expansive ( see for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.1.1 ) ) .",
    "so roughly speaking , if @xmath14 is forward expansive , then the distance between two points that are close enough grows exponentially under forward iterations of @xmath14 .    since a thurston map , by definition , has to be a branched covering map , we can always find two distinct points that are arbitrarily close to a critical point ( thus arbitrarily close to each other ) and that are mapped to the same point .",
    "thus a thurston map can not be forward expansive . in order to impose some expansion condition ,",
    "it is then natural to consider backward orbits .",
    "we say that a thurston map is expanding if for any two points @xmath28 , their preimages under iterations of the map gets closer and closer .",
