    "systems made of correlated electrons confined in semiconductor nanoscopic dot and ring structures , so - called quantum dots ( qds ) and rings ( qrs ) respectively , have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental research , see e.g. refs . and references therein . from the latter point of view , for quantum dots",
    "it has been proved @xcite the possibility to tune over a wide range the number of electrons contained in the system , as well as to control both the size and the shape of the dots by means of external gate voltages , goal that has not been achieved yet for ring geometries due to the higher complexity of their fabrication process , @xcite which involves several experimental techniques such as atomic force microscopy,@xcite strain - induced self - organization @xcite or droplet molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "@xcite    the interest of qrs arises from their peculiar behavior in the presence of a perpendicularly applied magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) , which is very distinct from that observed in qds and shows up as an oscillatory behavior of their energy levels as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this property , together with the fact that in narrow enough qrs the electrons experiment a nearly one - dimensional coulomb repulsion , leads to the integer and fractional aharonov - bohm effects , usually associated with the appearance of the so - called persistent currents in the ring .",
    "@xcite these quantum - interference phenomena have been experimentally reported @xcite and have motivated a series of theoretical works whose number is steadily increasing , see e.g. , refs .",
    "and references therein .",
    "one of the most appealing possibilities offered by electron systems confined in semiconductor heterostructures is their ability to form coupled entities , usually referred to as `` artificial molecules '' , in which the role of the constituent `` atoms '' is played by single quantum dots or rings and that have analogies with natural molecules such as the hybridization of the electronic states forming molecular - like orbitals .",
    "in addition , these artificially coupled systems present important advantages such as a tunable `` interatomic '' coupling by means , e.g. , of the modification of the relative position / size of the constituents .",
    "this fact has , besides its intrinsic interest , potential relevance to quantum information processing schemes since basic quantum gate operations require controllable coupling between qubits . in this sense , artificial molecules based on two coupled qds , called quantum dot molecules ( qdms )",
    "have been proposed as scalable implementations for quantum computation purposes and have received great attention from the scientific community in the last years see e.g. refs . and references therein .    also , molecular - beam epitaxy techniques have recently allowed the synthesis of _ quantum ring molecules _ ( qrms ) in the form of concentric double qrs @xcite and vertically stacked layers of self - assembled qrs , @xcite the optical and structural properties of the latters having also been characterized by photoluminescence spectroscopy and by atomic force microscopy , respectively .",
    "this has sparked theoretical studies on the structure and optical response of both vertically and concentrically coupled qrs of different complexity and scope , revealing properties different from those of their dot counterparts due to the non - simply connected ring topology .",
    "for instance , studies on the single - electron spectrum of vertical qrms @xcite have shown that the electronic structure of these systems is more sensitive to the inter - ring distance than that of coupled qds . as a consequence , in ring molecules quantum tunneling effects",
    "are enhanced since less tunneling energy is required to enter the molecular - type phase .",
    "also , the consideration of `` heteronuclear '' artificial molecules constituted by slightly different qrs offers the interesting possibility to control the effective coupling of direct - indirect excitons @xcite by means of the application of a magnetic field and taking advantage of the fact that charge tunneling between states with distinct angular momentum is strongly suppressed by orbital selection rules . to this end",
    ", some authors have considered the case of qrms made of strictly one - dimensional , zero - thickness qrs and have used diagonalization techniques to address the few - electron problem .",
    "@xcite the simultaneous effect of both electric and magnetic fields applied to a single - electron qrm has also been studied @xcite see also ref .  and",
    "the optical response of qrms where the thickness of the constituent qrs is taken into account has been obtained.@xcite in addition , the spatial correlation between electron pairs in vertically stacked qrs only electrostatically coupled has been shown to undergo oscillations as a function of the magnetic flux , with strongly correlated situations between ground states with odd angular momentum turning out to occur even at large inter - ring distances .",
    "@xcite more recently , the structure of a qrm made of two vertically stacked quantum rings has been addressed at zero magnetic field for a few tens of electrons within the local spin - density functional theory ( lsdft ) neglecting@xcite and incorporating@xcite the vertical thickness of the constituent qrs .    in this work",
    "we address the ground state ( gs ) of two thick , vertically coupled identical quantum rings forming `` homonuclear '' qrms populated with up to 40 electrons and pierced by a perpendicularly applied magnetic field .",
    "we extend in this way our previous study,@xcite addressing the appearance and physical interplay between the spin and isospin@xcite degrees of freedom as a function of the variation of both the intensity of the magnetic field and the inter - ring separation .",
    "modelling systems charged with such large number of electrons requires the employment of methodologies that minimize the computational cost .",
    "here we have made use of the lsdft,@xcite whose accuracy for the considered values of the magnetic field has been assessed@xcite by comparing the obtained results for a single qd with those given by the current - spin - density functional theory ( csdft),@xcite which in principle is better - suited for high magnetic fields , and also with exact results for artificial molecules.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly introduce the lsdft and the model used to represent the vertical qrms . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the obtained results for some selected configurations , and a summary is given in sec .",
    "the axial symmetry of the system allows one to work in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the confining potential @xmath2 has been taken parabolic in the @xmath3-plane with a repulsive core around the origin , plus a symmetric double quantum well in the @xmath4-direction , each one with width @xmath5 , depth @xmath6 , and separated by a distance @xmath7 . to improve on the convergence of the calculations ,",
    "the double - well profile has been slightly rounded off , as illustrated in fig . 2 of ref . .",
    "the potential thus reads @xmath8 , where @xmath9 with @xmath10 nm , and @xmath11 if @xmath12 and zero otherwise .",
    "the convenience of using a hard - wall confining potential to describe the effect of the inner core in qrs is endorsed by several works in the literature.@xcite we have taken @xmath13 nm , @xmath14 350 mev , @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 nm . these parameters determine the confinement for the electrons together with the distance between the constituent quantum wells that is varied to study qrms in different inter - ring coupling regimes .    for small electron numbers ( @xmath17 ) , it is justified to take @xmath18 to be @xmath17-independent .",
    "however , in a more realistic scheme its value should be tuned according to the number of electrons contained in the system , relaxing the confinement as the latter is increased . in the case of quantum dots",
    "it has oftenly been used a @xmath19-dependence that arises from the @xmath20-expansion near the origin of the coulomb potential created by a two - dimensional uniform positive charge distribution jellium model and that it is generalized to the case of quantum dot molecules as @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the number of electrons filling bonding orbitals see below . the rationale for this generalization",
    "is given in ref . .",
    "it is clear that the mentioned @xmath17-dependence would be harder to justify for qrs , and in fact no alternative law is known for a single qr that could be generalized to the case of qrms . for this reason , in this work",

    "the superscript @xmath62 corresponds to symmetric ( antisymmetric ) states under reflection with respect to the @xmath63 plane bisecting the qrms , and the subscript @xmath64 refers to positive(negative ) parity states .",

    "we have defined the `` isospin '' quantum number @xmath65 bond order in molecular physics as@xcite @xmath66 , @xmath67 being the number of occupied bonding(antibonding ) sp states .",
    "due to the large number of variables needed to characterize a given qrm configuration ( electron number , magnetic field and inter - ring distance ) , we limit ourselves to present results in a limited range of values for such variables , aiming at discussing calculations that might illustrate the appearance of some properties of the systems under study .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we have also addressed one single qr symmetrically located with respect to the @xmath63 plane with the same thickness ( 5 nm ) and radial confinement as the coupled rings .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the kohn - sham sp levels for one single ring hosting @xmath17=40 electrons as a function of @xmath68 for different values of the applied magnetic field .",
    "as it is well known , these levels are @xmath69-degenerate at @xmath70 . in this particular case",
    ", the gs has @xmath71 , and it is made up of symmetric ( with respect to @xmath63 ) sp states with up to @xmath72 . in the non - interacting single - electron model , in which the coulomb energy is not considered and consequently the sp wave functions factorize into a @xmath20-dependent and a @xmath4-dependent part with associated quantum numbers @xmath73 and @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75 , one would say that the gs is made up of sp states with @xmath76 and radial quantum numbers up to @xmath77 .    when @xmath78 0 , the @xmath69-degeneracy is lifted and , on the other hand , the @xmath79 sp levels become progressively depopulated in favor of those with @xmath80 as the magnetic field increases until eventually at about @xmath81 4 t only @xmath80 orbitals are filled . at this point , only a few states with @xmath82 are occupied , and the ring has @xmath83 . from this value of @xmath0 on , the simultaneous filling of increasingly higher-@xmath68 states and those close to @xmath84",
    "gives rise to configurations containing only states with @xmath85 and with large values of the total spin ( e.g. , @xmath86 for @xmath87 t ) .",
    "eventually , the system becomes fully spin - polarized at @xmath88 13.5 t. it is worth noticing the conspicuous bending of the `` landau bands '' ( sets of bonding or antibonding states characterized by the same @xmath89 and spin , and different value of @xmath68 ) , instead of displaying a fairly flat region , as it happens when the in - plane confinement is produced by a jellium - like potential,@xcite but not with our present choice of a @xmath17-independent parabola .",
    "it is also worth to stress that , due to the much stronger confinement in the vertical direction as compared to that in the radial one , only symmetric states are occupied .",
    "analogously , the energy levels corresponding to qrms with @xmath90 and inter - ring distances @xmath91 , 4 and 6 nm are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig4 ] .",
    "one can see the gradual evolution of the system as @xmath7 increases ; indeed , at @xmath91 nm the spectrum is very similar to that of the single ring , with only bonding sp states being occupied . as @xmath7 increases , a few antibonding orbitals become populated at small @xmath0 s , as one can see from the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , corresponding to @xmath92 nm , but eventually for increasing values of @xmath0 the qrms have again ground states where only bonding states are populated , as can be seen from the bottom panels of the same figure . for this inter - ring distance ,",
    "the fully spin - polarized state is reached at @xmath88 13.75 t. finally , for the largest ring separation considered , namely @xmath93 nm , a large amount of antibonding orbitals become occupied giving rise to small @xmath65 s instead of the fairly large isospin values found for similar configurations at smaller distances ( compare the bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] with those in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the fully spin - polarized gs is found at about @xmath94 7 t with @xmath95 , whereas for @xmath91 and 4 nm it appears near @xmath96 t and has the maximum possible isospin value , namely @xmath97 . at @xmath93 nm ,",
    "the maximum - spin state naturally consists of two distinct bands , one made up of bonding and another of antibonding states .",
    "these configurations are the qrm - analogues of the maximum density droplet ( mdd ) configurations found for qdms at similar inter - dot distances , called respectively mdd@xmath98 and mdd@xmath99 in ref . .",
    "increasing further the magnetic field causes the progressive occupation of higher-@xmath68 orbitals , which provokes the depopulation of the antibonding band and the consequent increase of @xmath65 . for the highest considered magnetic field ( @xmath94 14 t ) , some antibonding orbitals are still occupied , yielding @xmath100 .",
    "these results are a consequence of the evolution with @xmath7 of the energy difference between bonding and antibonding states , @xmath101 , which accurately varies as a function of the inter - ring distance according to the law @xmath102 , already found for qdms.@xcite in our case , from the difference in energy of single - electron ( bonding and antibonding ) qrms we have obtained @xmath103 mev and @xmath104 nm,@xcite values which have turned out to be unaffected by the applied magnetic field .",
    "clearly , the value of @xmath105 as compared to @xmath101 , which allows to discern between the strong ( @xmath106 ) and the weak ( @xmath107 ) quantum mechanical coupling regimes , has a crucial influence on the actual filling of bonding and antibonding sp states at a given inter - ring distance . indeed , increasing @xmath18 while keeping constant",
    "the double well structure may favor the population of antibonding orbitals for large enough values of @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite this can be understood from the non - interacting electron model , in which the single - electron energies are the sum of two independent terms , one arising from the @xmath4-localization and characterized by the quantum number @xmath74 , and another , which increases as @xmath18 does , arising from the @xmath20-localization and depending on @xmath68 and the radial quantum number @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath17 is large enough , the qrms can minimize its energy by populating antibonding states with low values of @xmath73 and @xmath68 instead of going on populating bonding states with higher quantum numbers .",
    "this explains why some antibonding states were filled even for @xmath91 nm at @xmath70 and @xmath90 for the qrms of ref . , where @xmath18 was taken to be 15 mev , value almost three times larger than the one considered in the present work .",
    "@xcite    this particular structure of the bonding and antibonding bands at high magnetic fields may have some observable effects on the far - infrared response of qrms .",
    "indeed , since the dipole operator can not connect bonding with antibonding sp states , for qrms in the weak coupling limit one would expect the dipole spectrum to display additional fragmentation in the characteristic edge modes of the ring geometry @xcite due to the contribution of the antibonding electron - hole pairs ( see e.g. the bottom panels of fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the evolution with @xmath7 of the gs energy and the molecular phase of qrms made up of @xmath108 electrons and submitted to magnetic fields of different intensities .",
    "notice that even moderate values of @xmath0 give rise to ground states with large total angular momentum , which increases as the magnetic field does .",
    "for this reason , we have denoted it by its actual value instead of employing the usual notation with upper greek letters , except for the cases with @xmath109 .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for all the values of the magnetic field we have considered ; on the one hand , for the studied inter - ring distances , the energy of the molecular phases increases with @xmath7 due to the enhancement of the energy of the bonding states , @xcite which dominates over the decrease of the coulomb energy for larger distances the constituent qrs are so apart that eventually this decrease dominates and the tendency is reversed . on the other hand , one can see that the first phase transitions are always found at the largest inter - ring distances since , as happens for qdms in the few - electron limit , they are due to the replacement of an occupied bonding sp state by an empty antibonding one .",
    "this also explains why in most of the cases , and especially for the highest magnetic fields , the total angular momentum of the qrms in the weakest coupling regime is reduced : the filled antibonding orbitals have lower @xmath68 s than the replaced bonding states .",
    "we have determined the magnetic field that gives rise to ring molecules with fully spin - polarized gs , and show it in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] as a function of @xmath17 for different inter - ring distances going from the strong to the weak quantum mechanical coupling regimes .",
    "the isospin value of each configuration is also indicated .",
    "the number of electrons , @xmath110 with @xmath111 to 5 , was chosen with the aim of producing closed - shell structures at @xmath70 in the weak coupling limit .",
    "one can see that the results for @xmath91 and 4 nm are very close , with only noticeable differences for @xmath112 .",
    "this can be understood from the bottom panels of figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , which show that for rather large magnetic fields only bonding orbitals are occupied for both ring separations .",
    "contrarily , from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] one can see that in weaker coupling regimes the filling of antibonding states favors the fully spin - polarization of the qrms at low @xmath0 intensities as compared to those needed when the rings are closer to each other , which explains the differentiated results corresponding to @xmath113 and 6 nm in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "when antibonding orbitas are populated , the variation of the magnetic field yields numerous transitions between different molecular phases with different isospin that are more complex than these observed in vertically coupled qds .",
    "this particular behavior is mainly due to the periodic destabilization suffered by the lowest-@xmath68 occupied orbitals induced by the magnetic field , which is a direct consequence of the aharonov - bohm effect and makes it rather difficult to find a pattern among the observed evolutions for the different electronic populations .",
    "the spin and isospin phases as a function of the magnetic field are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for @xmath93 nm corresponding to @xmath114 and 24 .",
    "it can be seen that in all cases at @xmath70 the qrms have @xmath95 and @xmath71 ; when @xmath0 is increased , non - monotonic spin and isospin oscillations with @xmath115 and @xmath116 and 2 appear , respectively .",
    "two facts , also present in qdms , @xcite are worth to be stressed : on the one hand , molecular phase changes from @xmath117(@xmath118 ) to @xmath118(@xmath117 ) ground states recall that , as explained in sec .",
    "ii , this sign is related to the symmetry of the molecular configuration involve @xmath119(-1 ) flips ; on the other hand , quite often the transitions in both magnitudes take place simultaneously , except obviously when the qrms reach the full spin - polarization , point from which on the isospin increases in one - unit jumps until the system is made up of only bonding states .",
    "the comparison of the isospin phases for qrms with @xmath92 and 6 nm is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for @xmath112 and 40 .",
    "clearly , the highest values of @xmath65 appear for the smallest inter - ring distances , as expected from the single - particle levels shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , corresponding to @xmath92 nm and @xmath90 , in which only a few antibonding orbitals are occupied for low values of @xmath0 . indeed , one can see from the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] that for this inter - ring distance magnetic fields of about 5 t are enough to yield configurations with the maximum isospin value @xmath120 , whereas for the qrms with @xmath93 nm such values of @xmath0 still correspond to small @xmath65 s due to the large amount of filled antibonding states .",
    "we have also calculated the addition energies , defined by @xmath121 @xmath122 being the total energy of the @xmath17-electron system , for qrms made of up to 14 electrons at different inter - ring distances , submitted to several magnetic fields , as a function of @xmath17 . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "we have also calculated @xmath123 for the corresponding single rings .",
    "the results for @xmath124 and 6 t are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig9]-[fig11 ] , respectively , in which the bottom panels correspond to the single ring .    from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] one can see that at zero magnetic field the single - qr addition spectrum presents the usual intense peaks at @xmath125 and 10 with zero total spin , and those at @xmath126 and 8 with @xmath71 satisfying hund s rule .",
    "similar results are found for the qrms with @xmath91 and 4 nm , indicating that such systems behave as a single ring owing to the strong quantum mechanical coupling corresponding to these inter - ring distances notice that the spin values coincide for all the configurations but that with @xmath127 . this fact contrasts with the results found for the vertical ring molecules of ref . , where at @xmath92 nm the spectrum clearly reflected an intermediate coupling situation due to the filling of the first antibonding orbitals .",
    "as commented before , for the systems studied in the present paper such states are only occupied for larger inter - ring separations ( or @xmath17 s of the order of 30 ) .",
    "the spectrum corresponding to @xmath93 nm is shown in the top panel of the same figure .",
    "one can see that , although some of the marked peaks are preserved , in particular those at @xmath128 and 8 , the ones at @xmath129 no longer exist notice that for 6 electrons the spectrum presents now a minimum and also that a new peak is found at @xmath130 .",
    "this intricate structure can be understood from the corresponding single - particle energy levels .",
    "indeed , it appears that the qrms with @xmath131 are made up of only bonding states , the first antibonding state being filled when @xmath130 . from @xmath132 on , the qrms have always occupied both b and ab orbitals but , however , the intermediate 6-electron configuration has again only symmetric states .",
    "this alternate behavior evidences that 6 nm is not a separation large enough for the qrms to be in the weak coupling limit , but rather corresponds to an intermediate regime .",
    "notice also that , from the results of ref .",
    ", in the weak coupling limit one would expect to find clearly marked peaks at the same @xmath17 values as for the single ring multiplied by two i.e . at @xmath126 , 12 and 20 , indicating that the rings are so apart that behave as isolated entities .",
    "we have checked that for our qrms to present such spectrum , we should consider inter - ring distances of about 10 nm . the different spin values for @xmath93",
    "nm as compared to those in the strong coupling regime can also be explained from the sp levels .",
    "for example , the @xmath133 assignation of the qrm with @xmath130 is due to the above - mentioned filling of an antibonding spin - up with @xmath84 orbital replacing the spin - down @xmath134 state occupied for @xmath91 and 4 nm .",
    "analogously , the configuration with @xmath71 ( instead of @xmath83 ) for @xmath135 can also be explained from the sp levels : in the strong coupling limit , the qrm is formed by the spin - degenerated sp levels with @xmath136 and @xmath137 , but this closed - shell configuration is prevented by the filling of the antisymmetric orbitals at @xmath93 nm .",
    "finally , the reverse situation occurs at @xmath108 , where the closing of the antibonding @xmath84 and @xmath138 shells contrasts with the hunds - rule configurations found for the strongly coupled molecules .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows the addition energies corresponding to the situation in which a magnetic field of 3 t is applied to the rings . like what is found at @xmath70 , the spectrum of the single system and of the molecules with @xmath91 and 4 nm are rather similar notice the different energy scales , the most remarkable difference being the salient minimum that appears for the single qr at @xmath130 . for the above - mentioned inter - ring distances , peaks with @xmath83",
    "are found at @xmath139 and 12 , as well as a peak at @xmath140 with @xmath141 , although they are not as clearly marked as at @xmath70 .",
    "it turns out that , even in the presence of a magnetic field , when the single - particle energy levels no longer display the @xmath142degeneration , the qrms can adopt configurations that are somehow analogue to these characteristic of the situation at @xmath70 , namely the closed - shell ones and those fulfilling hund s rule .",
    "indeed , for e.g. @xmath92 nm and @xmath135 , the ring molecule is made up of the spin - degenerate bonding states with @xmath143 ( instead of those with @xmath144 of the @xmath70 case ) .",
    "similarly , at @xmath140 the occupied orbitals are the spin - up and -down ones with @xmath145 and 2 , and the spin - up ones with @xmath84 and 3 ( instead of the spin - degenerate states with @xmath146 filled at zero magnetic field ) . for larger inter - ring separations ,",
    "the occupancy of the first antibonding orbitals washes out these structures and the addition spectrum becomes flatter and irregular .",
    "one can notice also the different spin assignations between the single and the coupled systems , especially for the lowest - populated configurations .",
    "in particular , the single qrs with @xmath147 turn out to be fully spin - polarized , which can be attributed to the combined effect of the magnetic field and a relatively strong exchange - correlation interaction characteristic of few - electron single quantum rings .",
    "the relatively higher spin values at @xmath93 nm for @xmath148 are due to the filling of the antibonding states .    finally , the addition energies for @xmath149 t are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "it can be seen that in all cases the only clearly marked peak is the one at @xmath128 , with the rest of the spectra being rather flat , following the trend observed at @xmath150 t. nevertheless , some weak peaks are still found and can be interpretated as in the previous cases , e.g. the one at @xmath108 for @xmath92 nm with @xmath151 : the system fills the spin - up and -down states with @xmath152 and the spin - up ones with @xmath145 and 5 .",
    "one can also notice that the faint peak of the 4-electron configurations of both the single ring and the qrm with @xmath91 nm becomes a minimum at larger inter - ring distances . concerning the spin , the single qrs and the qrms with @xmath91 and 4 nm turn out to be fully polarized for @xmath153 and 3 , respectively , whereas the filling of the antibonding states favors the fully spin - polarization of molecules with the largest ring separation for all the considered electron numbers .",
    "within the local spin - density functional theory , we have addressed the ground state of quantum ring molecules containing up to 40 electrons , with different inter - ring distances , and submitted to perpendicular magnetic fields . in the strong coupling regime the energy levels and the addition energies of the qrms are similar to those of a single qr , although some differences are found due to the effect of the magnetic field , which has a tendency to wash out the clearly marked peaks characteristic of the @xmath70 case as well as to yield flatter addition spectra .",
    "however , even at @xmath1 , some peaks are still present and they can be interpretated as at zero magnetic field .",
