    "prior to the announcement of the _ wmap _ results @xcite , observations of high-@xmath0 sne provided the most compelling evidence of the existence of a nonzero cosmological constant .",
    "since then , they have been used in combination with the _ wmap _ data to refine the determination of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the luminosity distances @xmath7 are determined by combining the observed fluxes @xmath8 with estimates of the sne luminosities @xmath9 .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath7 are caused by uncertainties in @xmath9 , because sne are not perfect standard candles .",
    "the flux @xmath8 is much easier to measure , but for distant sources the value of @xmath8 might be altered by gravitational lensing caused by the intervening distribution of matter .",
    "for instance , a magnification @xmath10 would result in a increase in @xmath8 , and an underestimation of @xmath7 .",
    "estimating the effect of lensing on the statistics of high-@xmath0 supernovae is a complex problem . using either an analytical model or ray - tracing simulations , we can estimate the effect of lensing of a large number of sources in a statistical sense .",
    "we would then need to redo the error analysis on the sne data to include in a consistent way the effect of lensing .",
    "this would be a very complex task , and in this paper we have chosen a much simpler approach .",
    "_ our goal is not to obtain a precise estimate of the error introduced by lensing , but rather to assess the importance of this effect : is it dominant , important , or negligible , and for what range of redshift ? and how does it affect the discrimination between different cosmological models ? _ to answer these questions , we take at face value the published results of type  ia sne , including their error bars which account for every source of uncertainty but gravitational lensing . then",
    ", we include _ a posteriori _ the effect of lensing , to estimate the change in the errors .",
    "this approach is not rigorous at all , and does not constitute a substitute for a rigorous treatment of the errors .",
    "but it has the great advantage of simplicity .",
    "we do not have to redo the detailed error analysis performed by the high - redshift sne groups , and , more importantly , our conclusions will not be tied to any particular sample or particular data reduction and error analysis technique used by any particular group .",
    "we are seeking to make generic statements about the importance of lensing ( or lack of ) that are relevant to any current or future sample of high-@xmath0 sne .",

    "@xcite used ray - tracing experiments to estimate the effect of weak lensing on the determination of the deceleration parameter @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite focused on sne as a mean to study the nature of weak lensing .",
    "the issue of determining the cosmological parameters for distant sne , and how this determination is affected by lensing , was addressed by @xcite who used semi - analytical models to determine the magnification distribution function , @xcite who used monte carlo ray - tracing simulations to study the effect of weak and strong lensing , and @xcite and @xcite , who estimated the effect on lensing along individual lines of sight by considering the properties of foreground galaxies in the same direction .",
    "these various studies concluded that the effect of lensing on current determinations of the cosmological parameters is small .",
    "@xcite discussed the effect of gravitational lensing on a population of sne at @xmath12 .",
    "what distinguishes our approach is mostly its simplicity .",
    "our calculations depend on very few assumptions , and this implies a certain amount of robustness to our results .",
    "even though we rely on numerical simulations , this work should be regarded as a back - of - the - envelope calculation , whose purpose is to obtain a qualitative estimate of the effect of lensing on the determination of cosmological parameters by distant sne .",
    "using ray - tracing experiments , rather than a semi - analytical approach , enables us to extend our study to redshifts much higher than the ones considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : in  2 , we describe our calculation of the magnification distribution @xmath13 , and how to estimate that distribution at any redshift @xmath0 . in  3 , we describe the real and mock samples of supernovae we use for our calculations .",

    "matter is divided into two components : background matter and galaxies .",
    "we use a @xmath15 algorithm @xcite to simulate the distribution of background matter .",
    "the simulations used @xmath16 equal - mass particles and a @xmath17 pm grid , inside a comoving volume of size @xmath14 .",

    "each experiment consists of propagating a square beam of @xmath26 rays back in time from the present to redshift @xmath27 , through the matter distribution .",
    "the rays in the beam were widely separated , by 6 arc minutes , and therefore sampled different regions of space .",

    "these authors actually use the notation @xmath57 for @xmath54 and @xmath58 for @xmath55 .    in this paper , we work with the sample of @xcite .",
    "this is not the most up - to - date sample , but it is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "this sample is comprised of 230 type ia sne in the redshift range @xmath59 , with 79 of them being located at redshifts @xmath60 ( including 5 at redshifts @xmath61 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be read directly in the @xmath62 and @xmath63 columns of their table  8 , respectively .",
    "we generated a mock catalog of 43 sne in the range @xmath64 .",
    "for each `` supernova , '' we need to choose a redshift @xmath0 , a measured value @xmath54 , and an uncertainty @xmath55 .",
    "there is of course no rigorous method for doing that , since these sne do not exist . to provide a good coverage of the redshift range of interest",
    ", we used 43 equally - spaced values of @xmath0 between @xmath65 and @xmath66 . to determine @xmath55",
    ", we first plotted @xmath55 versus @xmath0 , for the @xcite sample , to look for trends .",
    "there is a large number of sne with @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "if we focus on the 79 sne at redshift @xmath69 , we do not see any obvious trend , and in particular @xmath55 does not appear to increase with redshift .",
    "so we chose , somewhat arbitrarily , the 9 sne at @xmath70 . for these sne ,",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the uncertainties are @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",

    "this ensures a smooth transition between the real and mock samples .    to determine @xmath54 , we assume that the underlying cosmology corresponds to a @xmath4cdm universe ( as supported by the real sample ) .",
    "we then use @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the actual value of @xmath77 in a @xmath4cdm universe , and @xmath78 is a random number drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation given by the value of @xmath55 we just calculated .",
    "as we explained in  1 , our goal is not to perform a rigorous error analysis of the uncertainties resulting from the possibility of lensing , but rather to estimate _ a posteriori _ the effect of lensing on the uncertainties already present in the analysis .",
    "we estimate the effect of lensing as follows : the distances of high-@xmath0 supernovae are reported in the literature in the format given by equation  ( [ apmda ] ) , where @xmath55 is the intrinsic uncertainty ( i.e. not caused by lensing ) .",
    "the distance @xmath7 is related to the luminosity @xmath9 and flux @xmath8 by @xmath79    we use equations  ( [ apmda ] ) and  ( [ flux ] ) to eliminate @xmath7 , and get @xmath80    the effect of lensing will be to modify the flux @xmath8 . to account for it ,",
    "we replace @xmath8 by @xmath81 in equation  ( [ lsqh0 ] ) , and perform a taylor expansion to first order in @xmath82 , @xmath83    this expression reduces to @xmath84    the last term represents the uncertainty due to lensing . for a given supernova with magnification @xmath29 , @xmath85 . of course",
    ", we will never know the value of @xmath29 for a single source .",
    "but for a large number of sources , we can use statistics .",
    "first , the simplest , lowest - order approximation for a `` typical '' value of @xmath29 is @xmath86 , or equivalently @xmath87 .",
    "equation  ( [ errors1 ] ) reduces to @xmath88     versus redshift .",
    "the dotted lines separate the real data of tonry et al .",
    "( left side ) from the mock , high - redshift data ( right side ) .",
    ", width=480 ]    where @xmath89 can be computed using the empirical relations plotted in figure  [ sigma ] .",
    "we use the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 reported by @xcite ( their table  8) . in figure",
    "[ ratio ] , we plot the ratio @xmath90 versus @xmath0 ( left of the dotted lines ) .",
    "this quantity increases with redshift , but never gets higher than 0.5 for the tonry et al . sample .",
    "furthermore , we shall assume that @xmath55 and @xmath91 are statistically independent , and combine them in quadrature , using @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the total error .",
    "the contribution of lensing to this error is then of order 25% at most .    for each supernova",

[ [ deltabin ] ] comes from @xmath100 $ ] ) .",
    "notice that this method of averaging is much fancier than what appears to be done in the supernovae papers .",
    "for instance , figure  9 of @xcite shows an averaging over redshift bins which is based on the median of the data and apparently does not take into account the uncertainties @xmath55 on the individual supernovae .",

    "the three curves , from top to bottom , show the exact results for the @xmath4cdm , low - density , and matter - dominated models , respectively .",
    "the results support the flat @xmath4cdm model and exclude the other models considered .",
    "the other panels of figure  [ hubble ] show the effect of lensing ( the three models have to be plotted separately , because the correction due to lensing , which uses the relations plotted in fig .  [ sigma ] , is model - dependent ) .",
    "this effect is totally negligible .",
    "the largest correction to the error bars is about 10% for the highest redshift bin , for the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "relative to an empty universe , for the three models considered .",
    "the dotted lines separate the @xcite data ( on the left ) from the mock data ( on the right ) . in the top panel ,",
    "the three curves , from top to bottom , show the analytical result for the cosmological models ( @xmath101,@xmath102)=(0.27,0.73 ) , ( 0.3,0.0 ) , and ( 1.0,0.0 ) , respectively .",
    "the error bars show 90% confidence level .",
    "the last three panels reproduce the data of the top panel , but have been corrected to account for lensing . since this correction is model - dependent , the three models are plotted on separate panels . , width=441 ]    clearly , the potential error introduced by lensing is negligible in comparison to the intrinsic error in the measurement , at least for sne at redshifts @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reach the same conclusion , we now estimate the effect of lensing on a yet - undiscovered population of very - high-@xmath0 sne , using our mock catalog .",
    "the ratios @xmath90 are plotted in figure  [ ratio ] , on the right hand side of the dotted lines .",
    "the effect of lensing rapidly becomes important at redshift @xmath5 , especially for the @xmath4cdm models .",
    "we find many sne with @xmath103 , that is , the correction due to lensing is larger than the intrinsic uncertainty .",
    "the points located on the right hand side of the dotted lines in figure  [ hubble ] shows the results for the mock data .",
    "the error bars get significantly bigger when lensing is included .",
    "furthermore , at redshift @xmath104 , it becomes very difficult to distinguish the open , low density model from the cosmological constant model , because the theoretical curves intersect .",
    "keeping in mind the caveat that the mock catalog was built under the assumption that the underlying cosmology was @xmath4cdm , we see that the einstein - de  sitter model is totally ruled out by sne at @xmath5 , but the open model is not . indeed , it is clear that sne at @xmath5 would be rather useless in distinguishing an open cdm and a @xmath4cdm model : the theoretical curves get closer , whereas the error bars become larger .",
    "it is , interestingly , the sne in the redshift range @xmath6 that would still provide the best discriminant between these two models , and data in that redshift range are already available .",
    "the calculation presented in the previous section relies entirely in the standard deviation @xmath34 for estimating the uncertainties caused by lensing .",
    "this approach would probably be sufficient if the distributions of magnifications @xmath13 were gaussian .",
    "however , for sources at large redshifts , @xmath13 is strongly skewed , as figure  1 shows .",
    "the large majority of sources are demagnified , as the light reaching the observer travels mostly through underdense regions of the universe , while a few sources are strongly magnified , especially those which happen to be aligned with a massive galaxy at intermediate redshift .    , but with @xmath91 computed using the monte carlo approach for all sne ( real or mocked ) at redshift @xmath61 .",
    ", width=480 ]    to account for the distribution of magnifications , we consider all sne at redshifts @xmath61 ( 5 from the tonry sample , 43 from the mock catalog ) .",
    "for each one , we determine the distribution @xmath13 at its redshift @xmath0 , using equation  ( [ newpmu ] ) , and then choose a magnification @xmath29 by drawing it randomly from the distribution @xmath13 .",
    "we then compute @xmath105 .",
    "the resulting ratios @xmath106 are plotted in figure  [ ratio2 ] .",
    "comparing with figure  [ ratio ] , we find only a few sne for which this ratio exceeds unity .",
    "for all redshifts and all models , we find that the distributions @xmath13 peak at a value @xmath107 such that @xmath108 . hence , setting @xmath109 ( instead of @xmath85 ) ,",
    "as we did in  4.1 , overestimates the effect of lensing for most sne .",
    "however , the distributions are very skewed , and as a result a few sne are highly magnified , as figure  [ ratio2 ] shows .    , with errors bars computed using the monte carlo approach .",
    ", width=441 ]    figure  [ hubble_hz2 ] shows the resulting hubble diagram . comparing with figure  [ hubble ] , we find that the error bars are significantly smaller .",
    "the effect of lensing is less important when we use the actual distribution of magnifications @xmath13 , and not only its standard deviation .",
    "however , the results at @xmath110 , which assume an underlying @xmath4cdm cosmology , still can not rule out the open cdm model ; the error bars are still too large .",
    "so far , we have assumed that any supernova , with any value of @xmath0 and @xmath29 , can be observed .",
    "this assumption is probably valid over the range @xmath111 , which includes all the current observations .",
    "but as the redshift gets higher , it becomes increasingly difficult to observe supernovae with current and even future telescopes , because of the combined effect of the flux reduction and the light being shifted to the near infrared .",
    "it might just be impossible to detect a supernova at redshift @xmath5 unless , of course , it is magnified by lensing .",
    "@xcite argue that , with magnification taken into account , it might be possible to observe type  ii sne at redshifts up to @xmath112 .",
    "of course , if only the highly - magnified sne are observable , this introduces biasing , an effect that we must take into account .    here , we do not want to perform a detailed analysis similar to the one of @xcite , but just to get a rough estimate of the importance of biasing .",
    "the key results of the analysis of @xcite are shown in their figure  7 , which shows , as a function of redshift , the ab apparent magnitude in the j , k , l , and m bands , with and without lensing .",
    "they also plot the expected flux limit of _",
    "jwst_. from this figure , we see that without lensing , the apparent magnitudes are below the detection limit at high redshift . when lensing is included , the magnitudes in the j and k bands are above the detection limit .",
    "their analysis was for type  ii sne .",
    "type  ia sne are typically 1.5 magnitudes brighter , and therefore much easier to detect . neglecting the details of the spectra",
    ", we can simply take figure  7 of @xcite and shift all the curves upward by 1.5 magnitudes .",
    "we find that , without lensing , type  ia sne would be visible in the j and k band , and almost visible in the l band , at redshifts up to @xmath113",
    ". with lensing , most sne would be demagnified , but the reduction in flux is typically of the order @xmath114 , that is , a correction of @xmath115 magnitudes .",
    "hence , all high-@xmath0 type  ia sne should be detectable , using the proper telescope , and therefore we were justified to ignore any biasing effect .",
    "this being said , the identification of type ia sne requires that we obtain a spectrum , and this could be quite challenging at these extreme redshifts .",
    "we have assumed that the typical intrinsic uncertainties @xmath55 do not grow with redshift for @xmath110 , based on the absence of obvious trend at @xmath116 .",
    "if the uncertainties do grow with redshift , our conclusion that understanding the effect of lensing at high redshift would be weakened , in the sense that these data would be rather useless no matter how well lensing is understood .",
    "furthermore , it would reinforce our conclusion that sne at intermediate redshifts are more useful to discriminate between different cosmological models .",
    "we should also ask whether type  ia sne at redshift @xmath117 can actually exist . for a @xmath4cdm model with a hubble constant of @xmath118",
    ", this redshift corresponds to an age of the universe of @xmath119 .",
    "subtracting the formation and evolutionary time of the progenitor , we are getting embarrassingly close to the big bang .",
    "type  ii sne would be a far better candidate for high-@xmath0 sne , since the evolutionary time of their progenitors are much shorter .",
    "but then only the few that are magnified would be detectable , and their number might be too small to perform any meaningful statistics on them .",
    "we have performed a series of ray - tracing experiments using a multiple lens - plane algorithm . we have determined the distributions of magnifications @xmath13 for sources in the redshift range @xmath120 , for three different cosmological models .",
    "we have used these distributions to estimate the effect of gravitational lensing on the determination of the cosmological parameters with high - redshift type  ia supernovae .",
    "we used a generic , _ a posteriori _ approach which is not tied to any particular sample .",
    "we found that errors introduced by lensing are unimportant for sne with redshift @xmath1 .",
    "these errors are negligible compared to the intrinsic errors already present in the supernovae data . since those intrinsic errors do not prevent us from determining the cosmological parameters , the additional errors introduced by lensing have no consequences .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite .    using a mock catalog of high-@xmath0 sne , extending to @xmath121",
    ", we showed that the effect of lensing on a hypothetical population of sne at redshifts @xmath5 could be quite significant , and must be understood before such sne could be used to constrain cosmological models .",
    "furthermore , the open cdm and @xmath4cdm are difficult to distinguish at that redshift .",
    "we showed that , even if sne at redshift @xmath113 were ever discovered , it is the sne in the range @xmath122 that would still provide the best discriminant between these two models .",
