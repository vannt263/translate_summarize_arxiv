    "when a film of a type ii superconductor is placed in a magnetic field large enough to permit penetration of vortices , a transport current in the film acts on the vortices through a lorentz force that is opposed by a pinning force and , eventually , by a drag force . when the lorentz force exceeds the pinning force , the vortices are set into motion and the drag force comes into play .",
    "when the lorentz force is substantially larger than the pinning forces but the transport current is still small compared to the depairing current , previous experiments @xcite showed that the resulting dissipation is reasonably well described by the bardeen - stephen ( bs ) model @xcite . in this region",
    "it is ohmic , but as the current is increased , it becomes non - linear and eventually reaches an instability manifested by a discontinuous increase in voltage . at temperatures not far below the critical temperature",
    ", the instability has been studied in a classic paper @xcite by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) .",
    "they showed that the electron distribution departs from a thermal distribution at high vortex velocities , changing the superconducting order parameter and altering the drag force on the vortices .",
    "they predicted a non - linearity in the current - voltage characteristic and an instability in the vortex motion when the vortices reach a critical velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the lo instability is due to a decrease in the drag force with increasing vortex velocity , accompanied by a decrease in vortex size .",
    "lo showed that the critical velocity is independent of the magnetic field .",
    "early experiments on low-@xmath1 systems @xcite confirmed larkin and ovchinnikov s results and predictions .",
    "subsequent experiments on y@xmath2ba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( ybco ) by doettinger , huebener , gerdemann , khle , anders , truble , and villgier @xcite and by xiao and ziemann @xcite , also confirmed lo behavior .",
    "however , experiments carried out at lower temperatures @xcite on ybco , showed a non - linearity and instability with a very different dependence of @xmath0on the magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "analysis @xcite showed that the new behavior could be accounted for by a simple model in which the electron gas has a thermal - like distribution function characterized by a higher temperature than the lattice and bath .",
    "larkin and ovchinnikov did , in fact , suggest this possibility in their original paper @xcite without exploring its consequences . as the electron temperature rises ,",
    "the resulting increase in resistivity causes a decrease in current above a certain electric field and hence a non - monotonic response .",
    "this model yields a critical vortex velocity @xmath0at instability that is proportional to @xmath7 , as seen in the low-@xmath8 experiments .",
    "some of the essential consequences of such a hot - electron instability were calculated in our earlier papers and shown to be consistent with experimental observations .    in the present work some of the simplifying assumptions and restrictions in the previous calculations",
    "have been removed and more complete calculations have been carried out :    1 . ) the rate @xmath9of transfer of energy from the electron gas to the lattice  which plays a crucial role in determining the electron temperature  was taken as a constant in previous discussions of the model . in this paper",
    "we show that it can be expected to have a strong temperature dependence .",
    "this temperature dependence of @xmath10is now included in our numerical calculations of the current - voltage curves .",
    "we find that the general shape of the current - voltage relation is not very sensitive to the temperature variation of @xmath10 because the electron gas passes rapidly from the bath temperature to a temperature not far below @xmath1 before any significant non - linearity is manifested .",
    "this is a consequence of the very small low - temperature specific heat of a superconducting electron gas .",
    "however , the strong temperature variation of the relaxation time gives a sensitive measure of the electron temperature .",
    "evaluation of @xmath10from the data near the instability point indicates an electron temperature much higher than the bath temperature , supporting the heated electron picture of the instability .",
    "the calculation of this electron - lattice energy relaxation time is presented in section iii below .    2 . ) in our previous work@xcite , we assumed the film thickness to be negligible compared to the phonon mean free path , so that the phonon temperature is uniform throughout the film . in this work",
    ", we remove this assumption and take phonon lifetime effects into account",
    ". the phonons will not necessarily be at the bath temperature , and will have a non - thermal distribution which varies with position in the film .",
    "phonon lifetime effects can be taken into account following work by bezuglij and shklovsky @xcite , who solved the phonon kinetic equation for a thin film .",
    "the non - thermal phonon distribution found in this solution can be incorporated into our calculation of the energy transfer rate , and provides a correction to our earlier results .",
    "this result is derived in section iv below .",
    "we begin in section ii by giving a description of the model presenting some new numerical results for the current - voltage curves under various conditions and for the critical parameters at the instability .",
    "the macroscopic fields in a type ii superconductor carrying a transport current are related to the velocity of the vortices by the fundamental relation @xmath11 which follows from the law of induction .",
    "this equation can be used to find the electric field once the vortex velocity is determined by considering the fundamental dissipative processes in the medium .",
    "elastic forces can be shown to be negligible .",
    "one of the dissipative processes is the scattering of normal electrons in the vortex core and quasiparticles outside the core first treated by bardeen and stephen .",
    "they found that the transport current density @xmath12 is expressed in terms of the upper critical field @xmath13 and the normal resistivity @xmath14 by @xmath15 later treatments @xcite take into account the relaxation of the order parameter during passage of the vortex first treated by tinkham @xcite .",
    "they give results which vary with circumstances , but agree with eq.([j1 ] ) to within a numerical factor of order 1 .",
    "these energy dissipation mechanisms raise the energy of the electrons , and this energy subsequently relaxes to the lattice .",
    "the assumption of our model is that the electron - electron scattering time is small enough compared to the electron - phonon inelastic scattering time that the electron gas remains in internal thermal equilibrium at a temperature higher than the lattice temperature .",
    "the plausibility of the assumption can be checked by estimating the cross - over temperature below which electron - electron scattering is dominant .",
    "the standard estimates @xcite of the scattering rates @xmath16 and of @xmath17 then give a cross - over temperature of the order of 100 k for parameters appropriate to ybco@xcite .",
    "this temperature is indeed higher than the range of interest in the experiments .",
    "changes in the energy density of the electron gas can be described by a rate equation that includes the work done by the electric field and the exchange of energy with the lattice . if we assume that the exchange can be described approximately by an energy relaxation time @xmath10 , then the equation is @xmath18 where @xmath10can depend on the phonon temperature @xmath19 as well as on the elevated electron temperature @xmath20 .",
    "we argue below that the dependence of @xmath10on @xmath19 is weak enough to be ignored in the relevant range of temperatures and the relevant energy transfer rates between the lattice and the bath .",
    "the quasiparticles transfer the energy they receive from the transport current to the lattice at a rate much higher than it is radiated back , and the energy then flows from the lattice to the bath .",
    "thus @xmath10can be assumed to depend only on @xmath20 , and we can write the steady - state equation @xmath21 where the energy difference in eq.([dudt ] ) has been expressed in terms of the electronic specific heat per unit volume .    equations ( [ j1 ] ) - ( [ jet ] ) determine the relationship between the electric field , the current density and the temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat and the upper critical field are taken from standard bcs theory @xcite . in calculating the specific heat ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the gap was taken from bcs theory and its magnitude was multiplied by a factor to give the observed zero - temperature gap @xcite and critical temperature . in the next section , we calculate the energy relaxation time and its temperature dependence .",
    "typical results of the model are presented in the following figures .",
    "[ fjeb ] shows the calculated current - voltage curves for different magnetic fields .",
    "the shape of the curves is in general qualitative agreement with the experimental data shown in fig [ expdat ] .",
    "the strength parameter @xmath22 of the electron - phonon coupling , defined in the next section , was adjusted to obtain agreement with the values of @xmath23 and @xmath12 at the peak .",
    "we comment on the choice of @xmath22 in the next section .",
    "the onset of the unstable region in the current - voltage response does not require explicitly invoking the forces on the vortices in treatment of the model .",
    "rather , the instability appears in the result as a region of negative differential conductivity , where @xmath12 decreases as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "the region begins at the value @xmath24 of the field that can be determined by calculating @xmath25 from eq.([jet ] ) , setting the result equal to zero , and solving for @xmath23 : @xmath26 where primes indicate differentiation with respect to temperature . resulting in steps in the current - voltage curves .",
    "such steps have been observed in constant - voltage measurements at high dissipations @xcite . ]",
    "the experimentally well - verified @xmath27 dependence of @xmath24 follows provided the temperature @xmath28 at the instability is independent or weakly dependent on @xmath6 so that the temperature - dependent factors c , @xmath10 , and @xmath13 in eq.([estar ] ) remain independent of @xmath6 .",
    "this result is a consequence of our model , since we have explicitly excluded a field dependence for these quantities and taken @xmath14 to be temperature and field independent .",
    "although volovik @xcite has shown that the specific heat has a @xmath6-dependence in type ii materials above the lower critical field , we have checked that his scaling prediction at low temperatures gives only a weak dependence in the range of fields @xmath29 relevant to our experiment .",

    "the rate of energy transfer from the electrons to the lattice at any given temperature is equal to the rate of transfer from the lattice to the electrons at the same temperature .",
    "indeed , the rate from phonon emission balances the rate from absorption and the rate from quasiparticle recombination balances the rate from pair creation . these results can be demonstrated in the deformation potential approximation , where the matrix element for phonon emission and absorption depends only on the phonon energy @xmath78 .",
    "for example , the rates for emission and absorption and for quasiparticle recombination and creation can be written    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the phonon occupation number at the given temperature and @xmath81 is the quasiparticle density of states , and @xmath82 has the value @xmath83 .",

    "wellstood , urbina , and clarke , @xcite , assert that the difference between the emission rate and the absorption rate for a normal metal is equal to the difference between the rate electrons radiate to a zero temperature lattice and rate phonons radiate to a zero temperature electron gas .",

    "<S> at high dissipation levels , vortex motion in a superconducting film has been observed to become unstable at a certain critical vortex velocity @xmath0 . at substrate temperatures substantially below @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the observed behavior can be accounted for by a model in which the electrons reach an elevated temperature relative to the phonons and the substrate . here </S>",
    "<S> we examine the underlying assumptions concerning energy flow and relaxation times in this model . </S>",
    "<S> a calculation of the rate of energy transfer from the electron gas to the lattice finds that at the instability , the electronic temperature reaches a very high value close to the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated energy relaxation times are consistent with those deduced from the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate the phonon mean free path and assess its effect on the flow of energy in the film . </S>"
