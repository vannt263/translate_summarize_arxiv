    "many theoretical works were stimulated to interpret the nature and the structure of the new particle , such as the @xmath1 bound state @xcite , the pseudoscalar glueball @xcite , and the radial excitation of the @xmath15 @xcite , etc .    in this article , we take the @xmath0 as a baryonium with the quantum numbers @xmath16 , and calculate the mass spectrum of the baryon - antibaryon bound states @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 with the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .",
