    "contrary to what may be perceived at a first glance , social and physical models were brought together several times , during the last four centuries .",
    "in fact , not only maxwell and boltzmann were inspired by the statistical approaches in social sciences to develop the kinetic theory of gases , but one can even cite the english philosopher thomas hobbes , who already in the seventeenth century , using a mechanical approach , tried to explain how people acquaintances and behaviors may contribute to the evolution towards a stable absolute monarchy@xcite .",
    "more than making a historical perspective if these approaches were successful and correct or not , it is almost unquestionable that , at a certain level , there are social phenomena that could be more deeply understood by using approaches of statistical and physical models .",
    "recently@xcite , this perspective gained considerable strength from the increased interest on - and in several senses well - succeed - network approach , where one describes complex systems by mapping them on a graph ( network ) of nodes and links and studies their structure and dynamics with the help of some statistical and topological tools from statistical physics and graph theory@xcite .",
    "when addressing the specific case of a social system , nodes represent individuals and the connections between them represent social relations and acquaintances of a certain kind .",
    "social networks were studied in different contexts@xcite , ranging from epidemics spreading and sexual contacts to language evolution and vote elections . however , although they are ubiquitous , social networks differ from most other networks , yielding a still broad spectrum of unanswered questions and improvements to be done when studying their statistical and topological properties . in this paper",
    ", we will address three fundamental open questions related to the typical structure and dynamics associated to social networks .",
    "the first open question has to do with the modeling of social networks .",
    "the recent broad study of empirical social networks has shown that they have three fundamental features common to all of them@xcite .",
    "first , they present the small - world effect@xcite with small average path lengths between nodes and high clustering coefficients meaning that neighbors tend to be connected with each other .",
    "second , they have positive correlations : the highly ( poorly ) connected nodes tend to connected to other highly ( poorly ) connected nodes .",
    "third and last , invariably one observes an organization of the network into some subsets of nodes ( communities ) more densely connected between each other .",
    "although there are arguments pointing out that all these features could be consequence from one another@xcite , the modeling of specific social networks reproducing quantitatively all these features has not been successful .",
    "using a recent approach to construct networks , based on a system of mobile agents , it is possible to reproduce all these features . in section [ sec : mobileagents ] we will further show that the degree distributions characterizing social networks typically follow a specific one - parameter distribution , so - called brody distribution .    the second question is related to the intrinsic nature of the nodes . for certain social networks",
    "there are intrinsic features of the individuals which must be considered in the analysis .",
    "for instance , the gender in networks of sexual contacts@xcite or the hierarchical position in a network of social contacts inside some enterprise . from the network point of view",
    "this distinction means to introduce multipartivity in the network , biasing the preferential attachment between nodes that tend to connect with nodes of a certain type .",
    "when there are two types of nodes , e.g.  men and women , and the connections between them is strongly related to this type , e.g.  men can only match women and vice - versa , the standard measures to analyze network structure fails . in particular , the standard clustering coefficient@xcite , is unable to quantify the connectedness of broader neighborhoods that typically appear in multipartite networks . in sec .",
    "[ sec : clustering ] we will revisit some of the clustering coefficients used to study clustering in bipartite networks , and show how the combination of both clustering coefficients can yield good estimates of normalized cycle distributions . moreover , we will discuss a general theoretical picture of a global measure of increasing order of clustering coefficients according to some suitable expansion .    the third open question has to do with the heterogeneity of nodes in what concerns their influence in the connections and therefore in the propagation phenomena on social networks . in rumor",
    "propagation@xcite , for instance , one usually treats all connections equally in the spread of some signal ( opinion , rumor , etc ) .",
    "this is a suitable assumption for situations like the spread of an opinion which is equally interesting to all nodes in the network , for example political opinions to some vote election .",
    "however , there are also several social situations where the signal is not equally interesting to all nodes , as the case of spreading of some gossip about some common friend . in these cases there are connections which will be more probably used to spread the signal than others , since not all our friends are also friends of the particular person which is being gossiped about and therefore , either we tend to not tell the gossip to them or they tend to not spread it even if they hear it . in sec .  [ sec : gossip ] we will present a simple model for gossip propagation and describe some striking features .",
    "namely , that there is an optimal number of friends , depending on the degree distribution and degree correlations of the entire network , for which the danger to be gossiped is minimized .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we make final conclusions , giving an overview of future questions which could be studied in social networks arising from the topics studied throughout the paper .",
    "since the study of social networks is mainly concerned with topological and statistical features of people s acquaintances@xcite , the modeling of such networks has been done within the framework of graph theory using suitable probabilistic laws for the distribution of connections between individuals@xcite .",
    "this approach proved to be successful in several contexts , for instance to describe community formation@xcite and their growth@xcite .     in a randomly chosen direction ( arrows ) . at @xmath0 two nodes ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 collide and a connection between them is introduced ( solid line ) , velocities are updated increasing their magnitude and choosing a new random direction . at @xmath3 two other collisions occur , between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath4 and between nodes @xmath1 and @xmath5 . in this way a network of nodes and connections between them emerges as a straightforward consequence of their motion ( see text).,width=377 ]    however , they present two major drawbacks .",
    "first , the graph approach may be suited to describe the structure of social contacts and acquaintances , but lacks to give insight into the social dynamical laws underlying it .",
    "second , these models seem to be unable to reproduce all the main features characteristic of social networks , at least at the fundamental level . in this context , it was pointed out that@xcite dynamical processes based on local information should be also considered when modeling the network . our recent proposal to overcome these shortcomings was to construct networks , from a system of mobile agents following a simple motion law@xcite . here",
    ", we briefly review this model and further present the analytical expression that fits the obtained degree distributions .",
    "in particular we show that the degree distribution typically follows a brody distribution@xcite .",
    "the model is given by a system of particles ( agents ) that move and collide with each other , forming through those collisions the acquaintances between individuals .",
    "consequently , the network results directly from the time evolution of the system and is parameterized by two single parameters , the density @xmath6 of agents characterizing the system composition and the maximal residence time @xmath7 controlling its evolution .",
    "each agent @xmath8 is characterized by its number @xmath9 of links and by its age @xmath10 .",
    "when initialized each agent has a randomly chosen age , position and moving direction with velocity @xmath11 and one sets @xmath12 . while moving , the individuals follow ballistic trajectories till they collide . as a first approximation we assume that social contacts do not determine which social contact will occur next . therefore ,",
    "after collisions , the total momentum should not be conserved , with the two agents choosing completely random new moving directions .",
    "figure [ fig01 ] sketches consecutive stages of the evolution of such a system of mobile agents .    assuming that large number of acquaintances tend to favor the occurrence of new contacts ,",
    "the velocity should increase with degree @xmath13 , namely @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant to assure dimensions of velocity , @xmath16 with @xmath17 a random angle and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are unit vectors .",

    "( [ velo ] ) controls the velocity update after each collision . here",
    ", we consider @xmath21 .",
    "further , the removal of agents considered here is simply imposed by some threshold @xmath7 in the age of the agents : when @xmath22 agent @xmath8 leaves the system and a new agent @xmath23 replaces it with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and randomly chosen moving direction .",
    "the selected values for @xmath7 must be of the order of several times the characteristic time @xmath26 between collisions , in order to avoid either premature death of nodes .",
    "too large values of @xmath7 are also inappropriate since in that case each node may on average collide with all other nodes yielding a fully connected network .     and the system of mobile agents that reproduce their topological and statistical features . in",

    "[ fig02]a one sees the normalized residence time @xmath29 as a strictly monotonic function of the average degree @xmath28 . from the residence time it is also possible to define a collision rate , as the fraction between the average residence time @xmath30 and the characteristic time @xmath26 , namely @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the characteristic time of the system at the beginning when all agents have velocity @xmath11 .",

    "to measure `` the cliquishness of a typical neighborhood '' in a network , watts and strogatz  @xcite introduced a simple coefficient , called the clustering coefficient , which counts the number of pairs of neighbors of a certain node which are connected with each other , forming a cycle of size @xmath44 . while such tool enables one to access the structure of complex networks arising in many systems  @xcite , helping to characterize small - world networks  @xcite , to understand synchronization in scale - free networks of oscillators  @xcite and to characterize chemical reactions  @xcite and networks of social relationships  @xcite , there are other situations where this measure does not suit .",
    "namely , when the network presents a multipartite structure .",
    "for instance ,",
    "when there are two different kinds of nodes and connections link only nodes of different type , the network is bipartite@xcite and the bipartite structure does not allow the occurrence of cycles with odd size , in particular with @xmath44 .",

    ", we will discuss how these different clustering coefficients are related to each other and how one can use them to improve the knowledge of the network structure .",

    "therefore , @xmath124 is independent of the degree , similarly to what is observed for the density of particles as derived by catanzaro et al@xcite in diffusion - annihilation processes on complex networks .",
    "for correlated networks , as the empirical network here studied , the analytical approach is not straightforward and will be presented elsewhere .     of spreading times @xmath26 for ( a ) the apl network of 8 generations , and ( b ) the real school network ( circles ) and the ba network with @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( solid line).,width=321 ]    another quantity of interest is the distribution @xmath146 of spreading times , which clearly decays exponentially for the apollonian network , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig09]a .",
    "this behavior can be also obtained analytically by considering that @xmath147 and using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) together with the degree distribution , @xmath148 , to obtain @xmath149 for large @xmath13 .",
    "the slope in fig .",
    "[ fig09]a is precisely @xmath150 using @xmath40 from fig .",
    "[ fig07]a and @xmath151 from ref .",
    "@xcite . for the school network",
    ", @xmath146 follows also an exponential decay for large @xmath26 , but with a 3.5 times smaller characteristic decay time , and has a maximum for small @xmath26 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig09]b ( circles ) .",
    "compared to the @xmath146 of the barabsi - albert network with @xmath144 ( solid line ) , the shapes are similar but the barabsi - albert case is slightly shifted to the right , due to the larger minimal number of connections .",
    "many other regimes of gossip and of propagation phenomena can be also addressed with these two quantities .",
    "namely , a more realistic scenario could be addressed by enabling each node to transfer information with a probability @xmath152 .",
    "further , the assumption that the person to which a gossip did not spread at the first attempt , will never get it , yields a regime similar to percolation conditional to the neighborhood of the victim . differently",
    ", if at each time - step the neighbors which already know the gossip repeatedly try to spread it to the common friends , one observes the same value of @xmath124 measured for @xmath153 , and the spreading time scales as @xmath154 , where @xmath26 is measured for @xmath153 .",
    "finally , other possible regimes comprehend the situation where the gossip spreading over strangers , i.e.  over nodes which are not directly connected to the victim .",
    "such cases are being studied in detail and results will be presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "in this paper we presented and developed recent achievements in social network research , concerning the modeling of empirical networks , and specific mathematical tools to address their structure and dynamical processes on them .    concerning the modeling of empirical networks , we described briefly a recent approach based on a system of mobile agents .",
    "further developments were given , namely in what concerns the analytical expression which fits the typical degree distributions observed in empirical social networks .",
    "we gave evidence that such distributions follow a brody distribution which depends on a single parameter that scales with the average degree of the network .",
    "a question which now remains to be answered is how to derive such distribution from an analytical and meaningful approach .",
    "showing that the usual clustering coefficient is , in general , inappropriate when addressing the clustering properties of social networks , we described a suitable measure to access these properties and presented its additional applications for estimating the distribution of cycles of higher order .",
    "this additional clustering coefficient was also put in a general framework with different other higher - order coefficients , that could be useful for particular situations of multipartite networks .",
    "an expansion combining all possible coefficients was also proposed , motivated by previous works@xcite , which depends only on the degree distribution and degree - degree correlations .",
    "however , computational effort to compute such coefficients increases exponentially with their order and therefore it is not yet clear how useful such an expansion may be .    finally , to study dynamical processes in social networks , in particular the propagation of information , two simple measures were introduced .",
    "namely , a spread factor , which measures the maximal relative size of the neighborhood reached , when the information starts from a local source ( node ) , and a spreading time , which gives the number of sufficient steps to reach such maximal size .",
    "this two measures gave rise to introduce a minimal model for gossip propagation , which can be seen as a particular model of opinions .",
    "within this specific model , the spread factor was found to be minimized by a particular non - trivial degree of the source , which is related to the degree - degree correlations arising in the network . if such possibility of minimizing the danger of being gossiped can be tested in a real situation and which other implications these findings have in other situations - e.g.  in internet virus propagation - remain open questions for forthcoming studies .",
