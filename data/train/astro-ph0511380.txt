    "the time to achieve burst ignition depends primarily on the accretion rate and the h - fraction , @xmath15 , in the accreted material ; the composition at ignition , @xmath16 ( as well as the temperature of the fuel layer ) is modified by steady hot - cno h - burning between the bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the  spread in peak fluxes for the brighter ( @xmath44@xmath58 ) pre bursts is similar to that measured in 4u  1728@xmath034  ( paper a ) .",
    "if the variation in the peak fluxes of the bright pre bursts from 4u  1636@xmath0536  arises from the same mechanism , we might expect to find evidence for a connection with the persistent emission , as well as for reprocessing of the burst flux ( i.e. a correlation between the peak flux and fluence ) .",
    "while there are some indications for quasi - periodic variation at a period of @xmath59  d in the long - term all - sky monitor lightcurve , this periodicity does not appear to be reflected by the peak burst fluxes .",

    "we also found no evidence for modulation of the peak burst fluxes at the 3.8  hr orbital period ( using the most recent published ephemeris ; @xcite ) .",
    "we found two bursts that exhibited pre but reached peak fluxes significantly below the maximum peak flux of the non - pre bursts .",
    "while one of the bursts ( on 1999 sep 25 20:40:49 ut ) exhibited a factor of @xmath60 increase in radius and the archetypical flat - topped flux profile of a pre burst , the other ( on 2000 jan 22 04:43:48 ut ) had much more modest expansion and an overall less compelling case for pre .",
    "the bursts reached peak fluxes of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "these peak fluxes were consistent to within the errors , and were less than the mean for the remaining pre bursts by a factor of @xmath2(where the uncertainty arises primarily from the variation in the peak fluxes of the latter sample ) .",
    "these bursts represent a highly significant deviation from the normally - distributed peak fluxes of the remaining pre bursts , and lead to an overall variation of a factor of @xmath3 in the peak fluxes of pre bursts from 4u  1636@xmath0536 .    in fig .",
    "[ example ] we show the variation of spectral parameters throughout a bright pre burst , a non - pre burst , and one of the fainter pre bursts .",
    "the profiles for the bright and faint pre bursts ( a , left panels and c , right panels ) were similar before and after the pre episode .",
    "however , for burst ( c ) the flux was approximately constant during the pre episode at around @xmath63 , i.e. at around 60% of that reached at the peak of burst ( a ) .",
    "we note that the two faint pre bursts were observed while the persistent 2.525  kev flux was unusually high , above @xmath64 .",
    "we observed an insufficient number of bursts within this flux range to determine conclusively whether the peak flux distribution differed from that at lower persistent fluxes .",
    "both @xmath50  and @xmath14  measured at the time of maximum flux of the two faint pre bursts were , individually , within the ranges spanned by the brighter pre bursts .",
    "thus , the lower peak fluxes were not solely due to unusually low values of either of these parameters .",
    "we note that , as with previous observations @xcite , the radius maximum during the majority of the pre bursts was generally achieved prior to the maximum measured flux .",
    "thus , the luminosity continued to increase throughout the pre episodes , as has been found on other sources ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the two faint pre bursts were notable exceptions ; for those bursts , the peak flux coincided with the peak radius .",
    "given the relatively wide field of view ( @xmath65 ) of _ rxte _  it is conceivable that these fainter pre bursts actually originated from a previously unknown and more distant field source .",
    "the detection of burst oscillations at 580  hz in the burst on 1999 september 25 ( fig .",
    "[ example]c ; @xcite ) effectively rules out this possibility , at least for that burst .    a third burst , observed on 2002 january 15 14:08:16 ut , showed evidence of a local radius maximum , but at an even lower peak flux than burst ( c ) .",
    "during this burst the flux rose and decayed gradually , possibly with more than one local maxima .",
    "the maximum radius reached was only somewhat below that of burst ( c ) and , like that burst , was accompanied by a local minimum in @xmath14 .",
    "however , the peak flux was below @xmath66 , i.e. less than 25% the peak flux of burst ( a ) ; furthermore , the possible radius expansion episode occurred well before the peak flux was reached , at a flux of only around @xmath67 .",
    "this burst was substantially different in character from the other two faint pre bursts .",
    "it reached a comparable peak flux and was observed at a similar persistent flux level as were four double - peaked bursts , also observed by _",
    "rxte_. these bursts ( on 2001 september 5 08:15:04 ut , 2001 october 3 00:22:18 ut , 2002 january 8 12:22:44 ut and 2002 february 28 23:42:53 ut ) exhibited double peaks in the bolometric flux , as has been observed previously from this source @xcite . in contrast to the double - peaked bursts observed previously , in which the first peak was consistently higher , 3 of the 4 double peaked bursts observed by _ rxte _ reached a higher flux during the second peak .",
    "the relative fluxes of the two peaks varied from @xmath683 .",
    "two of the four double - peaked bursts exhibited a local maxima in the radius ( and a corresponding minimum in temperature ) coincident or just after the first flux peak , similar to what is generally interpreted as evidence for pre .",
    "because of this similarity , we conclude that the 2002 january 15 14:08:16 ut burst was not a genuine pre burst , but instead arose from the same phenomenon which gives rise to the double - peaked bursts .",
    "we have studied the peak fluxes of radius expansion bursts from 4u  1636@xmath0536and found the largest range yet seen in any lmxb .",
    "while the fractional variation of peak fluxes exceeded the expected range of the eddington limit between atmospheres with h at cosmic abundances ( @xmath69 , with @xmath70 ) and with pure he ( @xmath71 , @xmath6 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the distribution of peak fluxes was nearly bimodal , with the mean peak flux for the majority of the pre bursts being a factor of @xmath2  higher than the peak fluxes for the faint pre bursts .    in a previous investigation of x - ray bursts from 4u  1636@xmath0536  with _ tenma",
    "_ , @xcite observed a gap in the distribution of peak fluxes of bursts and identified the lower and upper boundaries of this gap as the eddington limits for h - rich @xmath69  and pure he fuel @xmath71 , respectively . according to their interpetation",
    ", the increase in radius which was observed during the pre bursts from 4u  1636@xmath0536  was accompanied by      ejection of an outer , h - rich layer , exposing the underlying pure - he layer below .",
    "bursts that never reached @xmath69  did not exhibit pre , while the characteristic flux limit for bursts that did exceed @xmath69  switched to @xmath71 , which is a factor of 1.7 higher .    in this paper , we reported the observation of two pre bursts that were apparently limited by @xmath69  instead of @xmath71 .",
    "this appears to confirm the hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "for those bursts , the effective eddington limit could have remained at @xmath69  if the burst energy was insufficient to drive off the outer h - rich layer .",
    "however , we also found a significant overlap between the peak flux distributions for the pre and non - pre bursts , without the gap found in earlier samples .",
    "bursts with peak fluxes within the range @xmath55@xmath56 were , however , relatively infrequent .",
    "this strongly suggests that the previously observed gap was merely a consequence of small burst samples , specifically 12 for the study of @xcite , and 27 for that of @xcite , with only 3 radius expansion bursts in each sample .",
    "four bursts observed by _",
    "rxte _ that peaked between the putative @xmath69  and @xmath71  values exhibited no evidence of pre ( an example is shown in fig . [",
    "example]b ) .",
    "in order for these bursts to have exceeded @xmath69 , the majority of the accreted h must have been ejected , but subsequently the flux must have remained below the effective eddington limit for the residual material .",
    "the fact that no observational evidence of this ejection is seen suggests that the ejected material becomes transparent on a timescale less than the 0.25  s bin time of our time - resolved spectra .",
    "ejection of the accreted hydrogen likely requires that the accreted material first becomes highly stratified . in a well - mixed atmosphere , the h and he nuclei",
    "are efficiently coupled to the electrons ( on which the radiation forces act ) through coulomb colisions , thus preventing any separation of the elements during the radius expansion episode .",
    "variation in the h - fraction with depth may arise via a number of mechanisms , such as steady h burning between the bursts or via convective mixing of deeper material during the previous x - ray bursts .",
    "however , as we show below , the properties of the x - ray bursts from 4u  1636@xmath0536  place strong constraints on these mechanisms .    in order to make a rough estimate for the requirements of the ejection of the h layer during a burst , we assume that all the radiation ( emitted at @xmath72 ) during the radius - expansion episode is imparted as kinetic energy to the h layer .",
    "since the h layer needs to be ejected in a short time @xmath73  s , the total energy available is simply @xmath74@xmath69@xmath75ergs .",
    "this amount of energy can unbind a layer of pure hydrogen of total mass @xmath76 which extends down to a column depth of @xmath77 for the burst to be subsequently limited by the pure - he eddington limit , the material below this column depth must be practically hydrogen free .",
    "this degree of stratification is rather difficult to achieve on an accreting neutron star , as we discuss below .",
    "@xcite estimate the column depth at which hydrogen runs out to be @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath80 is the mass fraction of cno nuclei , and @xmath15 is the mass fraction of hydrogen in the accreting material . for this column depth to be comparable to the requirement derived in equation  ( [ eq : y ] ) , the accretion rate or the mass fraction of cno nuclei in 4u  1636@xmath0536  have to be very different than what is normally assumed .",
    "depletion of hydrogen below a column depth of @xmath81  gr  @xmath82 is possible , according to @xcite , if compressional heating is taken into account , the local accretion rate is comparable to the eddington limit , and the core temperature of the neutron star is @xmath83  k. this is again a rather implausible combination , since a high rate of accretion in a persistent source , such as 4u  1636@xmath0536 , is inconsistent with a cool neutron - star core ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "convective mixing of deeper material during the previous x - ray burst also appears to be incapable of reducing the abundance of hydrogen at columns larger than @xmath81  gr  @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , the convective zone in the simulations by @xcite reached up to column depths that were at least two orders of magnitude larger than required .",
    "the properties of the bursts in 4u  1636@xmath0536  thus strongly suggest that there is an additional source of stratification which acts to separate the accreted elements , and allow the majority of the accreted h to be ejected during the brightest bursts .    in paper",
    "a , we also explored in detail the possibility that variations in @xmath44  could arise through systematic instrumental or analysis - related biases . for example , we considered the effect of deviations of the true emission spectrum from perfect blackbodies .",
    "implicit in our estimation of the bolometric fluxes in equation ( [ flux ] ) is a correction to the flux measured in the pca bandpass ; this correction adds around 7% to the peak 2.520  kev pca flux of radius expansion bursts .",
    "should the emitted spectrum deviate significantly from a blackbody , equation ( [ flux ] ) will not give the correct bolometric flux , potentially giving rise to spurious bolometric flux variations . as with 4u  1728@xmath034 ,",
    "variations in the flux contribution from outside the pca band of many times the typical bolometric correction would be required to account for the 30% variation in the peak flux of the majority of the radius expansion bursts from 4u  1636@xmath0536 .",
    "we consider this unlikely .",
    "it is even less likely that such effects could account for the factor of @xmath84 variation we observe in the peak fluxes of all the pre bursts from 4u  1636@xmath0536 .",
    "similarly , while variations in the persistent ( non - burst ) emission could in principle give rise to spurious scatter in the peak burst fluxes , the variation would have to be several times the total persistent flux level in the 2.525  kev band to account for the peak flux variation we observe .",
    "although we found no evidence for quasi - periodic variation in the peak fluxes of bursts from 4u  1636@xmath0536 , or correlations between the peak pre burst flux and fluence , we can not completely rule out reprocessing as a contributing factor to the  peak flux variation of the bright pre bursts .",
    "the lack of detectable quasiperiodic variations in the peak burst fluxes could result from inadequate sampling provided by the burst times , or possibly the intrinsic variability is aperiodic . as for the lack of a correlation between @xmath42  and @xmath44 , the burst profiles from 4u",
    "1636@xmath0536 were much more variable than those of 4u  1728@xmath034 , so that other ( possibly related ) variations between these properties could perhaps mask an underlying correlation resulting from reprocessing .",
    "an alternative explanation for the low peak flux pre bursts is that they arise from ignition of material confined to some fraction of the neutron star .",
    "some authors have suggested that such confinement may occur as a result of the influence of the neutron star s magnetic field on the fuel layer , or as a consequence of rapid rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . while recent modelling indicates that rotation may instead enhance spreading @xcite , variations in the properties of bursts with @xmath85 from some sources suggest uneven distribution of fuel over the neutron star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this possibility may also help to explain the observation of double- @xcite and even triple - peaked @xcite bursts from 4u  1636@xmath0536 .",
    "we also observed four double - peaked bursts in the _ rxte _  sample .",
    "confinement of the burst fuel could result in weaker radius - expansion bursts if the local eddington limit was reached , but only over a fraction of the neutron star surface . in that case ,",
    "expansion of the photosphere would still occur , at much lower total luminosity .",
    "if the expansion of the burning region of the photosphere went to sufficiently large radii that it appeared isotropic to a distant observer , the result might be a burst which appeared similar to a normal radius expansion burst , but at a significantly lower peak flux .",
    "this explanation appears inconsistent with the observed radii in the tail of the faint pre bursts , which are in excess of that of some of the brighter pre bursts .",
    "it would also require that the factor of 1.7 between the peak fluxes of the two groups of pre bursts was a coincidence .",
    "we note that several other explanations have been proposed to explain the bursts with multiple peaks @xcite .",
    "previous estimates of the distance to 4u  1636@xmath0536  at between 67  kpc relied on the identification of the peak flux of the pre bursts as @xmath71@xcite , in addition to a gravitational redshift measured from absorption features in the burst spectra @xcite . while absorption features have now been detected in burst spectra from other sources using more modern , high - resolution spectroscopic instruments @xcite , it is widely thought that the earlier detections using proportional counters were more likely to arise from instrumental effects . without the absorption line measurement ,",
    "the analysis of @xcite likely can not substantially constrain the distance to 4u  1636@xmath0536 .",
    "despite the increase in measurement precision for peak burst fluxes with _ rxte _ , the dominant uncertainty for distance estimates to most bursting sources remains the atmospheric composition , i.e. the value of @xmath16 in equation [ ledd ] . with the detection of pre bursts that apparently reach either @xmath69  or @xmath71 , the compositional question in 4u  1636@xmath0536",
    "is resolved , and we can make distance estimates using either group of bursts . on correcting the observed fluxes for the gravitational redshift at the surface of a @xmath86 ns with @xmath87  km , the fainter pre bursts ( which we assume reach @xmath69 ) lead to a distance estimate of @xmath88  kpc .",
    "the distance estimate assuming that the brighter pre bursts reach @xmath71  instead is fully consistent with this value at @xmath9  kpc , where the uncertainty arises from the standard deviation of the peak fluxes for this larger group . from the faintest of this group of bursts",

    "<S> we also observed non - radius expansion bursts that exceeded the peak flux of the faintest radius expansion bursts . </S>",
    "<S> for these bursts the accreted hydrogen must have been partly ejected or eliminated , but the burst flux did not subsequently reach the ( higher ) eddington limit for the underlying he - rich material .    </S>",
    "<S> we found no evidence for a gap in the peak flux distribution between the radius - expansion and non - radius expansion bursts , previously observed in smaller samples . assuming that the faint radius - expansion bursts reached the eddington limit for h - rich material ( @xmath5 ) , and the brighter bursts the limit for pure he ( @xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the distance to 4u  1636@xmath0536  ( for a canonical neutron star with @xmath7 , @xmath8  km ) to be @xmath9  kpc , or for @xmath10 at most 7.1  kpc . </S>"
