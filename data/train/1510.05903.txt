    "this effect is in contrast to conventional thermal transport where thermal currents are induced by temperature gradients , and can be regarded as a thermal counterpart of the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "we have shown that , in class diii topological superconductors with imaginary @xmath1-wave pairing fluctuation , the chiral gravitomagnetic effect can be realized dynamically due to the presence of the time dependences of the relative phase , i.e. , the leggett mode .",

    "we have briefly discussed a possible application of our study to the thermal responses of 3d point - nodal superconductors such as weyl superconductors .",
    "these two phenomena arise as a consequence of the realization of the dynamical gravitational axion field in condensed matter .",

    "note that the term ( [ u_theta_g ] ) has not yet been derived from a 3d microscopic model with gravitational field , whereas the theta term ( [ s_theta ] ) can be derived microscopically , for example , by the fujikawa s method .",
    "the derivation in ref . is based on the surface quantum thermal hall effect of massive majorana fermions .",
    "this can be seen clearly in the low - energy effective hamiltonian of 3d topological insulators such as bi@xmath125se@xmath126 .",

    "zhang , nat .",
    "phys . * 5 * , 438 ( 2009 ) .    more generally ,",

    "topological properties of a system are not changed qualitatively by continuous parameter changes , i.e. , they do not depend on the detail of the electronic band structure , as long as the bulk topological invariant is retained , which means that the effective hamiltonian of the bulk can be deformed so that the fermi velocities of the bulk and surface states are the same in the magnitude .",
