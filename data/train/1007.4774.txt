    "heavy - ion reactions at radioactive ion beam ( rib ) facilities allow us to form new exotic neutron - rich nuclei and to study their physical properties .",
    "examples include experiments with neutron - rich @xmath0sn beams on targets of @xmath5ni  @xcite and of @xmath1zr  @xcite .",
    "another experimental frontier is the synthesis of superheavy nuclei in cold fusion reactions involving spherical closed - shell @xmath6pb targets  @xcite and in hot fusion reactions with deformed actinide nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these experiments present numerous challenges for a theoretical description , in particular for dynamic microscopic theories .    at relatively large impact parameters ,",
    "heavy - ion reactions are dominated by deep inelastic collisions in which the nuclei make only brief contact .",
    "the reaction products have mass and charge similar to projectile and target , but the energy may be strongly damped . at smaller impact parameters ,",
    "an intermediate dinuclear system is formed .",
    "entrance - channel heavy - ion potentials have been calculated in various models , including the macroscopic - microscopic method with five shape parameters  @xcite , and the energy density functional method with extended thomas - fermi approximation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dynamical models  @xcite show that if the dinuclear system is able to move inside the saddle point , capture occurs which may lead to the formation of a compound nucleus with compact shape . during capture the energy of relative motion of the ions gets converted into intrinsic excitation energy @xmath3 .",
    "if a compound nucleus is formed it will subsequently decay either by particle evaporation or by fission . on the other hand ,",
    "if the dinuclear system separates before crossing the saddle point , the reaction process is called quasifission . in this case , the shape of the dinuclear system is very elongated ( large quadrupole moment ) .",
    "experimentally , it is possible to separate fusion - fission from quasifission by measuring the angular anisotropy of the fragments . in the collision of very heavy ions such as @xmath0sn+@xmath1zr considered in this paper ,",
    "studies of fusion reactions are complicated by the competition with quasifission and fusion - fission events which hinder the formation of evaporation residues .",
    "the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) theory provides a useful foundation for a fully microscopic many - body theory of heavy - ion collisions in the vicinity of the coulomb barrier  @xcite . partly because of the recent breakthroughs in microprocessor technology , it has become feasible to perform tdhf calculations on a three - dimensional ( 3d ) cartesian grid with no symmetry restrictions and with much more accurate numerical methods . at the same time",
    "the quality of effective interactions has also been substantially improved  @xcite .",
    "these developments allow for the testing of the time - dependent mean - field approach to nuclear reactions without any numerical uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "the tdhf code used in these calculations utilizes the full skyrme interaction , including all of the time - odd terms in the mean field hamiltonian  @xcite .    during the past several years",
    ", we have developed the density - constrained ( dc ) tdhf method ( dc - tdhf ) for calculating heavy - ion potentials  @xcite .",
    "we have applied this method to calculate fusion cross sections above and below the barrier for a number of systems : the first application was for the @xmath0sn+@xmath5ni  @xcite system .",
    "the fusion cross section at the lowest projectile energy has been re - measured  @xcite and now agrees remarkably well with our calculations .",
    "we have also performed calculations for @xmath5ni+@xmath5ni  @xcite and for @xmath7o+@xmath6pb@xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "we have found very good agreement between the measured fusion cross sections and the dc - tdhf results .",
    "very recently , we have carried out a microscopic dynamical study of the astrophysical triple-@xmath8 reaction to form a resonant state of @xmath9c  @xcite and a study similar to the one presented here for reactions involving superheavy formations  @xcite , using the same approach .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study reactions between the neutron - rich @xmath0sn nucleus and @xmath1zr at energies in the vicinity of the ion - ion potential barrier peak , and we compare observables to those of the stable system @xmath2sn+@xmath1zr .",
    "the dynamic microscopic calculations are carried out on a 3d cartesian lattice using both unrestricted tdhf and dc - tdhf methods .",
    "this is by far the heaviest neutron - rich system we have investigated so far , and the microscopic numerical calculations with the added dc are computationally very intensive .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  ii we summarize the formalism ( dc - tdhf , dynamic excitation energy , capture cross section ) . in section  iii",
    "numerical results are presented . in particular , we show contour plots of the mass density of the dinuclear system and discuss the dynamic quadrupole moment @xmath4 during the initial stages of the collision .",
    "we also calculate the heavy - ion interaction potential @xmath10 and demonstrate that in these very heavy systems the barrier height and width increase dramatically with increasing beam energy .",
    "interaction barrier heights and positions are also deduced from unrestricted tdhf runs .",
    "we examine the dynamic excitation energy @xmath11 during the initial stages of the collision and compare it to the excitation energy of the compound nucleus in its ground state , @xmath12 .",
    "finally , capture cross sections for the two reactions are analyzed in terms of dynamic effects , and a comparison with recently measured capture - fission data  @xcite is given .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section  iv .",
    "recently , we have developed a method to extract ion - ion interaction potentials directly from the tdhf time - evolution of the nuclear system . in our dc - tdhf approach  @xcite",
    ", the tdhf time - evolution takes place with no restrictions . at certain times during the evolution the instantaneous density is used to perform a static hartree - fock minimization while holding the total proton and neutron density of the dinuclear system constrained to be the instantaneous tdhf density .",
    "this provides us with the tdhf dynamical path in relation to the multi - dimensional static energy surface of the combined nuclear system . in the dc - tdhf method the ion - ion interaction potential",
    "is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dc energy at the instantaneous separation @xmath15 , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the binding energies of the two nuclei obtained with the same effective interaction .",
    "the interaction potentials calculated with the dc - tdhf method incorporate all of the dynamical entrance channel effects such as neck formation , particle exchange , internal excitations , and deformation effects . while the outer part of the potential barrier is largely determined by the entrance channel properties ,",
    "the inner part of the potential barrier is strongly sensitive to dynamical effects such as particle transfer and neck formation .    for the calculation of the ion - ion separation distance",
    "@xmath18 we use a hybrid method as described in ref .  @xcite . at large distances where a still visible neck allows us to identify two fragments",
    "we compute it as distance of the center of mass of the ions . for more compact configurations ,",
    "we compute @xmath18 from the mass quadrupole moment @xmath19 as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a scale factor to connect the definition smoothly to the large - distance region .    in heavy - ion reactions ,",
    "the total capture cross section consists of the following terms  @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denote the evaporation residue cross section , the quasifission cross section , and the fusion - fission cross section . in the reaction of light and medium - heavy ions , the fission barriers of the pre - compound system are so high that fission contributions are negligible . in this case",
    "we have @xmath24 . on the other hand , for the reaction of massive nuclei like @xmath0sn+@xmath1zr ,",
    "the pre - compound system is an excited state of the actinide nucleus @xmath25th with a fission barrier of only about 6 mev ; thus we expect sizable fission contributions , and the evaporation residue cross section is expected be be rather small .",
    "the number of quasifission events increases dramatically with the product of the charge numbers @xmath26 and with the orbital angular momentum @xmath27 in the entrance channel .",
    "another reason for the decreasing yield of er formation is that a heated and rotating cn may fission ( fusion - fission ) .",
    "ion - ion interaction potentials calculated using dc - tdhf correspond to the configuration attained during a particular tdhf collision . as",
    "mentioned above , for light and medium mass systems as well as heavier systems for which fusion is the dominant reaction channel , dc - tdhf gives the fusion barrier with an appreciable but relatively small energy dependence . on the other hand , for reactions involving massive systems fusion",
    "is not the dominant channel at barrier top energies .",
    "instead the system sticks in some dinuclear configuration with possible break - up after exchanging a few nucleons .",
    "the long - time evolution to break - up is beyond the scope of tdhf due to the absence of quantum decay processes and transitions .",
    "as we increase the energy above the barrier this phenomenon gradually changes to the formation of a truly composite object .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the _ extrapush _ phenomenon discussed in phenomenological models .",
    "for this reason the energy dependence of the dc - tdhf ion - ion potential barriers for these systems is not just due to the dynamical effects for the same final configuration but actually represents different final configurations .",
    "theoretically , the calculation of the total capture cross section is similar to the calculation of the fusion cross section @xmath28 with the understanding that the ion - ion interaction potential used in the calculations distinguishes the two events . in practice ,",
    "the potential barrier penetrabilities @xmath29 at @xmath30 energies below and above the barrier are obtained by numerical integration of the schrdinger equation for the relative coordinate @xmath18 using the well - established _ incoming wave boundary condition _ ( iwbc ) method  @xcite .",
    "this schrdinger equation contains the heavy - ion potential @xmath10 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr ] ) and the centrifugal potential . in the iwbc calculations the summation over @xmath31 in eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma_capt_1 ] is continued until the contribution becomes negligible to the total cross section . as we shall discuss below",
    ", we can also determine the maximum value of @xmath31 by performing tdhf calculations for non - zero impact parameters .",
    "the optimal way to study the problem would be to perform dc - tdhf calculations for different @xmath31 values , however for heavy systems the computational cost for doing this is very large . finally , for the calculation of capture cross sections it is possible to use a coordinate dependent effective mass @xmath32 as described in ref .",
    "the effect of using a coordinate dependent mass is to modify the inner part of the ion - ion potential , particularly at low subbarrier energies . for the energies studied here we have found this effect to be very small for capture cross sections .",

    "we utilize a few thousand time steps , and the dc is applied every @xmath52 time steps . to distinguish between deep - inelastic and capture reactions , we have also performed several unrestricted tdhf runs for the @xmath0sn+@xmath1zr system above the barrier .",

    "[ fig : capt_fiss132 ] we compare the dc - tdhf cross sections for deep - inelastic and capture reactions to experimental capture - fission cross sections measured at hribf with a radioactive @xmath0sn beam  @xcite . because the fission probability @xmath107 , our _ calculated capture cross sections _ should be regarded as an _ upper limit _ for the measured capture - fission cross sections .",
    "according to our unrestricted tdhf calculations , the dominant reaction channels at energies @xmath73 mev are the deep - inelastic and quasi - elastic channels .",
    "in fact , our density plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] reveal that at the lowest measured energy @xmath54 mev the nuclear surfaces barely touch .",
    "any fission from such an event would have to arise from sub - barrier neutron - transfer and should be negligible compared to capture fission at higher energies .",
    "we therefore make the conjecture that the bulk of the low - energy experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig : capt_fiss132 ] represent deep - inelastic and quasi - elastic events masquerading as capture - fission . indeed , because of the limited mass resolution in the hribf experiments",

    "plotted are total cross sections for capture and for deep - inelastic reactions calculated with the dc - tdhf method as function of the c.m . energy .",
    "like in the corresponding neutron - rich system , only the heavy - ion potentials calculated at energies @xmath58 mev lead to capture while potentials at lower energies are associated with deep - inelastic channels .",
    "we have also carried out unrestricted tdhf runs for this system at @xmath98 mev . at impact parameter @xmath108 fm",
    "we find a deep - inelastic reaction , and at @xmath109 fm we obtain capture .",

    "[ fig : capt124_v2 ] .",
    "this impact parameter corresponds to an orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath111 .",
    "if we use this angular momentum cut - off in the dc - tdhf method , we obtain the curve labeled @xmath111 ; as we can see , both methods yield the same capture cross section .     total cross section for capture ( solid line ) and for deep - inelastic reactions ( dashed line ) for the stable system @xmath2sn+@xmath1zr calculated with the dc - tdhf method as function of @xmath30 .",
    "the experimental capture - fission cross sections are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=325 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : capt124 ] we compare the dc - tdhf cross sections for deep - inelastic and capture reactions to experimental capture - fission cross sections measured at hribf .",
    "again , our calculated capture cross sections represent an upper limit for the measured capture - fission data .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is quite remarkable in view of the fact that we employ a fully microscopic theory based on a given energy functional , with no adjustable parameters related to the capture process .",
    "in this paper we have studied deep - inelastic and capture reactions for the neutron - rich system @xmath0sn+@xmath1zr at energies in the vicinity of the barrier .",
    "this is by far the heaviest neutron - rich system we have investigated using both unrestricted tdhf and dc - tdhf methods . to elucidate any special properties",
    "neutron - rich systems might possess , we have compared a number of observables to those of the stable system @xmath2sn+@xmath1zr .",
    "the dynamic microscopic calculations are carried out on a 3d cartesian lattice , and they require a large amount of cpu time , particularly with the added dc method .",
    "a contour plot of the mass density of the dinuclear system shows clearly a transition from two separate cores at lower energies to a shape configuration with overlapping cores or a single - core at energies @xmath58 mev .",
    "a study of the dynamic quadrupole moment @xmath4 shows that even at @xmath112 mev , the intrinsic quadrupole moment is @xmath113 times larger than that of the deformed compound nucleus @xmath25th during the initial stages of the collision .",
    "we also calculate the heavy - ion interaction potential @xmath10 , and we demonstrate that in these very heavy systems the barrier height and width increase dramatically with increasing beam energy @xmath33 .",
    "we find that the potential barriers of the neutron - rich system @xmath0sn+@xmath1zr are systematically @xmath72 mev higher than those of the stable system .",
    "by contrast , we observe large differences ( @xmath77 mev ) in the interaction barriers of the two systems which can be deduced from unrestricted tdhf runs .",
    "we then examine the dynamic excitation energy @xmath11 during the initial stages of the collision and compare it to the expression @xmath12 ( deduced from reaction kinematics ) which assumes that the combined system is in its ground state . finally , capture cross sections for the two reactions",
    "are analyzed in terms of dynamic effects , and a comparison with recently measured capture - fission data is given .",
    "one of the major open questions in the reactions of neutron - rich nuclei is the dependence of the barrier on isospin @xmath114 . to reveal possible systematic trends requires additional theoretical and experimental studies with a wide variety of projectile and target combinations which are expected to become available at current and future rib facilities . to be able to pin down the isospin dependence in a fully microscopic theory ,",
    "it is probably best to choose collision partners which are as simple as possible : projectile and target nuclei should be spherical in their ground state , and the compound nucleus should have a high fission barrier so that the fission component can be ignored ( at least at lower beam energies ) .",
    "a desirable reaction system of this kind appears to be @xmath0sn+@xmath115ca , and we are planning to investigate these reactions in the future .",
