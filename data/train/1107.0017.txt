    "observations of the milky way ( mw ) and the galaxy m31 shape to a great extent our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , three landmarks have been pivotal in the development of theoretical studies of structure formation : a ) the abundance of mw galaxy satellites that motivated one of the strongest points of tension with the now - standard @xmath0 cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) paradigm of structure formation @xcite , b ) the spatial distribution of the same satellites which triggered discussions on how unique the host dark matter halo of the mw is @xcite and c ) the measurements of the tidal debris of disrupted merging galaxies around the mw and m31 galaxy , confirming the hierarchical nature of galaxy evolution , one of the fundamental characteristics of @xmath0cdm @xcite . however",
    ", inferring general conclusions on galaxy evolution based on observations of these two galaxies requires an assessment on how biased the properties of the mw and m31 are with respect to a given control population .    in the framework of @xmath0cdm ,",
    "the study of the mw and m31 starts by modeling their individual host dark matter halos , _ assuming _ that their simulated formation histories are `` typical '' , or at least compatible with the assembly of the real local group @xcite .",
    "the basic definition of a lg ( in terms of the dark matter distribution ) has two basic elements based on the state of the system _ today _ : ( i ) the estimated masses of the dark matter halos corresponding to the mw and m31 ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) and ( ii ) the isolation of these two halos from other massive structures @xcite .",
    "two additional constraints could be the separation and the relative velocity of the two halos @xcite .",
    "however , the condition on the lg isolation admits a strict formulation , by requiring that the environment , in terms of the mass and position of the dominant galaxy clusters in the local universe , be as close as possible to the one inferred from observations .",
    "such an additional condition imposes restrictions on the possible outcomes of structure formation on scales of the order of @xmath8 mpc .",
    "this is considered here as the meso - scale as opposed to the large ( @xmath9 mpc ) or the small ( @xmath10 mpc ) scales .",
    "the new feature in the analysis presented in this paper is the inclusion of such observational constraints around the lg environment in the initial conditions of the simulation . in a series of three simulations from such initial conditions , in a wmap5 cosmology with a normalization @xmath11 @xcite , we are able to define a sample of three lg dark matter halo pairs that form and evolve under specific conditions reflecting structure of the local universe .",
    "in addition we will take advantage of one of the largest cosmological simulations carried out to date , the bolshoi simulation @xcite , to explore a larger sample of halos within the mass range of the lg , and calibrate possible cosmic variance effects .",
    "we analyze the constrained simulations with the primary goal of quantifying the assembly histories of the lg halos .",
    "this is driven by two different motivations .",
    "one is to find out whether the simulated lgs , that are selected by dynamical considerations pertaining to their redshift zero structure , have mass aggregation histories ( mahs ) that lead to the formation of disk galaxies like the mw and m31 .",
    "the other is to find out whether such a mah is dictated by by meso - scale environment of the lg , or whether a random selection of objects similar to the lg is likely to have a similar mah .    in section [ sec : clues ] , we describe our simulations and the method to re - construct the mass aggregation histories . in section",
    "[ sec : sample ] we describe how we build the different control samples for our statistical analysis . in section [ sec : results ] we study the mahs in the different samples and argue that the selection by different isolation criteria does not induce a strong bias in the statistics describing the mahs . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the possible origin of these findings and comment on the connection with observations of the mw and m31 . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in this paper we make use of four cosmological n - body dark matter simulations .",
    "three of them are part of the constrained local universe simulations ( clues ) project , whose aim is to perform n - body cosmological simulations that reproduce the local large scale structure in the universe as accurately as current observations allow .",
    "the fourth simulation is the bolshoi simulation , which was performed from unconstrained initial conditions and spans a volume @xmath12 times larger than each one of the clues simulations . in this section",
    "we will describe these simulations and the procedure we have used to construct the mass aggregation histories for the dark matter halos .",
    "first we describe the procedure employed to generate the constrained initial conditions .",
    "the observational constraints are the peculiar velocities drawn from the mark iii @xcite , surface brightness fluctuation @xcite and the position and virial properties of nearby x - ray selected clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the @xcite algorithm is used to generate the initial conditions as constrained realizations of gaussian random fields .",
    "these observational data sets impose constraints on the outcome of structure formation on scales larger than a few megaparsec .",
    "these constraints affect only the large and meso - scales of the initial conditions of the simulations , leaving the small scales essentially random .",
    "in particular . the presence of a local group with two dark matter halos roughly matching the masses , separation and relative velocities of the mw and m31 can not be constrained .",
    "the strategy employed here is to construct an ensemble of 200 different realizations of the constrained initial conditions and simulate these with @xmath13 particles on a box with side length @xmath14using the tree - pm mpi n - body code gadget2 @xcite , and then scan these for appropriate lg - like objects within a search box centered on the actual position of the lg .",
    "only three realizations are found to have such a lg object following the criteria detailed at the end of sect .",
    "[ sec : sample ] .",
    "it follows that the simulations analyzed here obey two kinds o selection rules . by construction these are constrained simulations whose large and meso - scales",
    "are designed to mimic the local universe .",
    "then , post factum , the simulations that have the appropriate lgs are selected for further analysis .",
    "the selected simulations are then re - simulated at high resolution of @xmath15 particles .",
    "the high resolution extension of the low - resolution simulation is obtained by creating an unconstrained realization at the desired resolution , fast fourier transforming it to @xmath16-space and substituting the unconstrained low @xmath16 modes with the constrained ones .",
    "the resulting realization is made of unconstrained high @xmath16 modes and constrained low @xmath16 ones .",
    "the transitional scale happens around the length scale corresponding to the nyquist frequency of the @xmath13 mesh , @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "this corresponds to a mass scale of @xmath19 , below which the structure formation can be considered as emerging primarily from the unconstrained @xmath16 modes .",
    "the cosmological parameters in these high resolution simulations are consistent with a wmap5 cosmology with a density @xmath20 , a cosmological constant @xmath21 , a dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath22 , a spectral index of primordial density perturbations @xmath23 and a normalization @xmath11 @xcite . with these characteristics",
    "each particle has a mass @xmath24 .",
    "we have used as well the bolshoi simulation @xcite to verify that the constrained simulation did not bias the halo samples and their mahs .",
    "the simulation was done in a cubic volume of @xmath25 on a side using @xmath26 particles , leading to a particle mass of @xmath27 , roughly 10 times lower than the resolution in the clues simulations .",
    "we take from the bolshoi simulation eight non - overlapping sub - volumes .",
    "each sub - volume has a cubic size of @xmath28 on a side , corresponding to a comoving volume comparable to the three clues simulations combined .",
    "the halo samples in the sub - volumes will be used to calibrate the impact of cosmic variance on the different statistics we use to characterize the halo populations .      in order to identify halos we use a fof algorithm .",
    "we do not include any information of the substructure in each halo . all the analysis related to the mass aggregation history",
    "is done in terms of the host halos .",
    "in particular the mergers do not correspond to the fusion of an accreted sub - halo with a central dominant host halo , but instead correspond to the moment of two halos overlapping for the first time .",
    "the fof algorithm has a linking length of @xmath29 times the mean inter particle separation .",
    "the mean overdensity of objects found with this linking length at redshift @xmath30 is 680 @xcite .",
    "we identify the halos for @xmath31 snapshots more or less equally spaced over the 13 gyrs between redshifts @xmath32 .",
    "all the objects with 20 or more particles are kept in the halo catalogue and considered in the merger tree construction .",
    "this corresponds to a minimum halo mass of @xmath33 . within the clues simulations a milky way like dark matter halo of mass @xmath34",
    "is resolved with @xmath35 particles , in the bolshoi simulation it is resolved with @xmath36 particles . for the bolshoi simulation we have used snapshots spaced by roughly @xmath37myr and followed the exact same procedure to build the halo catalogues and the merger trees .    within the fof analysis all fof groups with 20 or more particles are identified .",
    "the merger tree construction is based on the comparison of the particles in fof groups in two consecutive snapshots .",
    "starting at @xmath30 for every fof group in the catalog , @xmath38 , we find all the fof groups in the previous snapshots that share at least thirteen particles with @xmath38 and label them as tentative progenitors .",
    "then , for each tentative progenitor , we find all the descendants sharing at least thirteen particles . since the smallest fof groups contain 20 particles at least 2/3 of the particles must be identified in tentative progenitors or descendants .",
    "only the tentative progenitors that have as a main descendant the group @xmath38 are labeled as confirmed progenitors at that level .",
    "we iterate this procedure for each confirmed progenitor , until the last available snapshot at high redshift . by construction ,",
    "each halo in the tree can have only one descendant , but many progenitors .",
    "the mergers of fof groups correspond to the time where the fof radii of two halos overlap for the first time .",
    "the infall of the less massive halo into the host and the subsequent inspiral , disruption and fusion will be delayed with respect to the time of the fof merger .",
    "different theoretical approximations and methodologies can predict the infall - fusion time - scale only as an order - of - magnitude estimate @xcite .",
    "the most used time - scale for this process is based on the chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula , but improved estimates based on numerical simulations @xcite yield @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the virial radius , velocity and mass of the host halo , @xmath43 the mass of the future satellite at the moment of infall at @xmath40 .",
    "a median initial circularity of the satellite orbit of @xmath44 has been assumed . for mass ratios of @xmath45    @xmath46             [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      naively , one might hypothesise that the fact that all three clues lgs have a common mah , as defined here , is consistent with being drawn at random from the sample of pairs , i.e. the range of properties spanned by three random halo pairs can be naturally expected to be narrow .",
    "this is the null hypothesis we test now .",
    "what is the probability that 3 randomly selected pairs have mahs within the range of properties found for the lg ?",
    "we compute this probability based on the fraction of halos in the pair samples that share the _ lg _ formation properties .",
    "we define first the minimal subspace that contains the 3 simulated lgs by providing lower bounds on the different times describing the mahs .",
    "table [ table : probability ] lists the minimal last major merger , formation and assembly look - back times , where two options are taken to estimate the minima .",
    "the first defines the `` two sigma '' bound , namely the average value minus twice the standard deviation of each time of the 6 halos of the 3 lgs , the second takes the minimum value for each time .",
    "the table provides the fraction of halos in the _ individuals _ sample satisfying each one of the conditions @xmath47 independently and all of them simultaneously , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 and the subscript @xmath51 denotes the minimal bound of such time .",
    "we find that the fraction of _ individuals _ in the quiet mah subspace is @xmath52 both in clues and bolshoi for the first ( second ) minima option .",
    "if we consider now the halos either in the _ pairs _ or _ isolated pairs _ samples , only a fraction of @xmath53 pairs are composed of halos that are both within the _ lg _ parameter space . to a good approximation , the pair fraction can be calculated as the individual fraction squared , @xmath54 .",
    "this is the expected result under the assumption that the assembly of the mw and m31 are independent .",
    "the probability of randomly selecting three random halo pairs and having them within the range of parameters defined by the _ lg _ can be calculated as @xmath55 .",
    "this small probability is a consequence of having found 3 halo pairs within a set of properties shared by @xmath56 of the total population of halos . if we consider pairs with a range of desired properties within shared by , say , @xmath57 of the halos in the total population ( the fraction within one standard deviation around the mean ) , the probability of finding three pairs inside that range would be @xmath58 .",
    "comparing the results of the probabilities @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the null hypothesis can be safely rejected .",
    "it is highly unlikely that the three randomly selected pairs show a narrow range of properties as in the case of the _ lg _ sample .    both the _ ab - initio _ and _ post - factum _ constraints imposed on the lg yield a _",
    "lg _ sample with very similar mahs . in the clues simulations",
    "only the large and mid - scales are effectively constrained by the data leaving the galactic and smaller scales effectively random .",
    "it follows that the mah of objects similar to the lg is strongly affected by their environment . to",
    "what extent this is valid for dm halos in general remains an open question .",
    "we established in the previous sections that the mahs are quiet out to @xmath61gyr , and that none of the selection rules applied here to the pairs of halos have defined a sample of objects with mah similar to that of the three lgs .",
    "the last point is consistent with the results previous studies that have approached the same question of estimating a possible bias of the lg with respect to a general halo population @xcite .",
    "these studies apply isolation criteria on scales of @xmath62over halos in the mass range we study here , and find as well that no significant bias is introduced in the isolated halo population with respect to the parent halo population .",
    "the parameter subspace defined by the three _ lg _ can not by explained either in terms of the isolation criteria listed at the end of  [ sec : sample ] or by adding constraints on the values of the local over - density on @xmath63scales .",
    "the properties of the dynamical environment , common to all the clues simulations and provide the quiet formation history for a lg , remain to be found . ideally , that result should be expressed in a suitable form to search for lg pairs in an unconstrained simulation .",
    "is the observed local group biased in the same manner ?",
    "we can not provide the answer to that question with the simulations we present in this paper .",
    "nonetheless , the theoretical predictions we show here for the dark matter assembly in the lg seem to be in agreement with the disk dominated morphology of mw and m31 .",
    "the most distinct feature of the mw and m31 is that both galaxies have a disk dominated morphology .",
    "it is often mentioned that abundant mergers , which are presumed to destroy the disk and be source of morphological change , are expected on all mass scales in the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation of @xmath0cdm generating a possible contradiction with the abundance of disk galaxies in the local universe and , in particular , with the fact that the mw and m31 are disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "our results provide new theoretical evidence that the mw and m31 could be expected to be disk dominated galaxies in @xmath0cdm . from the results presented here",
    ", we have found that the last merger started on average @xmath64 gyr ago . at these redshifts the mass of the mw",
    "host halo is @xmath65 , its virial velocity is @xmath66 km / s and its virial radius @xmath67 . using these quantities and eq .",
    "[ eq : infall ] we estimate the final infall time for the satellite to be @xmath68 gyr , reaching the center @xmath69 gyr ago .",
    "this quiet history should favour the survival of a disk formed in the halo @xcite .",
    "although , detailed estimations on these matters might have to include the inflow of gas into the disk @xcite .",
    "a distinct and well characterised feature of the mw is the thick disk .",
    "this disk component of the mw has been known for more than 25 years @xcite .",
    "the thick disk contains a population of stars with different kinematics , spatial distribution , ages and chemical enrichment compared to the thin galactic disk . although m31 seems to have a similar component @xcite , the observational and theoretical work on the mw s thick disk has a long history , and its origin can therefore be discussed in greater detail .",
    "one of the possible formation scenarios for the mw thick disk is an in - situ formation during / after a gas rich merger @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the orbital eccentricity of stars based on rave and sdss data supports the gas - rich merger mechanism @xcite . in our results the last merger reaches the center @xmath69 gyr ago ,",
    "close to the look - back time of @xmath70gyr as required by the in - situ formation scenario .",
    "we use constrained simulations of the local universe to study the dark matter mass aggregation history ( mah ) of the local group ( lg ) .",
    "two basic questions motivate this study : 1 . to",
    "what extent the simulated lgs can account for the observed structure of the mw and m31 galaxies ?",
    "namely , if the disk dominated morphology implies that the mw and m31 halos had a quiet mah over the last @xmath71gyrs , can simulations recover this recent quiet history ?",
    "does this quiet mah arise from the intrinsic properties of the dm halos , or is it induced by environment within which the lg is embedded ?",
    "is the implied mah of the lg triggered by the large and meso - scales , or is it induced by the small , i.e. galactic and sub - galactic , scales ?",
    "the methodology adopted here is to use constrained simulations of the local universe , designed to reproduce the large and meso - scales of the lg environment , and search for halos that resemble the actual lg .",
    "the identification of a pair of halos as a lg - like object is based on a set of isolation and dynamical criteria , all formulated by their redshift zero structure , in complete ignorance of their formation history . a lg - like object that is found close to the actual position of the observed lg with respect to the large scale structure environment",
    "is defined here as a lg . by construction",
    "a constrained simulation can have only one lg or none at all .",
    "indeed , out of a suit of 200 constrained simulations only 3 harbour a lg . controlled samples of individual halos and pairs have been constructed as reference samples .",
    "the analysis has been extended to the unconstrained bolshoi simulation that is used here for an unbiased reference @xcite .",
    "the construction of the identification of the 3 lgs is done independently of the mah of the halos . yet",
    ", the mw s and m31 s halos of the 3 lgs all have a common quiet mah , defined as having the last major merger , formation and assembly look - back time extending over @xmath72 gyr .",
    "this quiet formation history of the simulated lgs can help to explain the disk dominated morphology of the mw and m31 , adding evidence to the internal instability origin of the spheroidal component of the mw @xcite . based on measurements of the eccentricity of orbits in the mw ,",
    "it has been recently claimed @xcite , that a rich merger taking place 10.5 to 8 gyr ago is a favoured mechanism explain the thick disk in the mw @xcite .",
    "our finding of a quiet mah of the lg provides a suitable platform for such a process to take place .",
    "the lg halos are assumed here to be selected from fof halos in the mass range @xmath5 at @xmath30 . between @xmath3 and @xmath4 of these halos",
    "are found to have a quiet mah , depending on the detailed definition of the quiet parameter space . from this point of view the mw and",
    "m31 halos are not rare .",
    "however , how likely is a pair of halos to have such a quiet history , shared by both halos ? making the naive null assumption that the mah of a halo is an intrinsic property of a halo independent of its environment then the fraction of pairs should be the product of the fractions for a single halo .",
    "indeed , the _ pairs _ sample drawn out of the bolshoi simulation confirms this assertion , finding that between @xmath6 to @xmath7 of the pairs have as quiet an mah as the lg systems do .",
    "the probability of having selecting 3 pairs randomly and finding them with a quiet mah is on the order of @xmath73 .",
    "next , we look for what dynamical or environmental property determines rethe mah of a lg - like object .",
    "we find here that the mere pairing of the mw - like halos does not affect the mah fiducial times .",
    "imposing the isolation and dynamical constraints that define the _ isolated pairs _ sample does not affect it either .",
    "this leaves us with an open question as to what determines the mah of halo pairs similar to the lg .",
    "the one hint that we have is that all of the three lgs reside in the same large and meso - scale environment .",
    "we speculate that the cosmic web plays a major role in shaping the mah of lg - like objects , although it is not yet clear what mechanism is responsible . a larger sample of constrained lgs is needed to confirm and further explore the reasons behind this result .",
