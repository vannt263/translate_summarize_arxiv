    "there are some methods to obtain usps in a nonclassical state .",
    "one is the degenerate three - frequency parametric amplification which has high phase sensitivity . other is spm in a kerr - nonlinear medium which in comparison with parametrical processes , does not require  phase - matching .",
    "this property is a real advantage for the pulsed nonclassical state formation .",
    "the both participation of spm and dispersion in the nonlinear medium leads to the optical soliton formation @xcite .",
    "the quantum theory of spm and xpm for usps developed during last @xmath0 years have difficulties produced , in particular , by the multi - frequency structure of usps and nonlinear kind of their interaction .",
    "the aim of our study is to develop the consistent quantum theory of nonlinear propagation of usps .",
    "an account is taken of the role of a response time of the nonlinearity .",
    "the first attempt has been made in @xcite  to give quantum analysis of spm of usps for the case of relaxation nonlinearity of medium , and has been noted that the correct quantum theory should take account of additional noise sources connected with nonlinear absorption .",
    "however , the theory developed in @xcitedoes not take account of noise sources , so that the commutation relation for annihilation and creation photon operators is not fulfilled .",
    "this was carried out in the developed in @xcite quantum theory of spm , where noise sources are considered as a fluctuation addition to the relaxation nonlinearity of medium .",
    "therefore , the results of @xcite  are connected with the range of carrier frequencies of the pulse , where the nonlinear absorption is important . actually the authors @xcitehave developed the quantum theory of usp propagation in a raman active medium . in @xcite",
    "the electronic kerr nonlinearity with finite response time is modeled as the raman active medium .",
    "note , if we deal with the usps propagation , for example , through fused - silica fibres only about @xmath1 of the kerr effect is attributable to the raman oscillators and about @xmath2 of the kerr effect is due to electronic motion @xcite .",
    "the case when the usp carrier frequency is far enough from some resonances ( one- and two - photon and the raman resonances ) , and therefore absorption is absent , was investigated by us in @xcite  where the finite response time is considered in the interaction hamiltonian , and the commutation relation is exactly fulfilled .    in the present work the results of the consistent quantum theory of spm and xpm of usps based on the use of the momentum operator ( quantity of movement ) are presented .",
    "the developed approach can be used when the response time is much shorter than the pulse duration and dispersion in nonlinear medium is neglected .",
    "there are no restrictions on the pulse intensity in our theory .",
    "the traditional way to describe the spm of usp is based on the interaction hamiltonian use , at that usually we solve the time - evolution equation . the transition to the spatial - evolution equation",
    "is realized substituting @xmath3 with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance passed in medium and @xmath6 is the group velocity .",
    "this approach seems to be good enough for single - mode radiation .",
    "if we deal with nonlinear propagation of usp then both @xmath3 and @xmath5 are present in analytical description .",
    "thus , we use the momentum operator of pulse field related to the space - evolution @xcite .",
    "we describe the spm of usp using the momentum operator ( cf .",

    "the nonlinear response function of a medium should be introduced as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the response time of nonlinear medium , that we assume to be much shorter than the pulse duration @xmath22 .",
    "this nonlinearity takes place in absence of the one- and two- photons absorption and raman resonances @xcite .",

    "we analyse now two - pulse propagation in an inertial nonlinear medium . we will consider that pulses have orthogonal polarizations or / and different frequencies . then , besides spm of each pulse , the xpm effect takes place . here",
    "we assume that the parametrical interaction of pulses can be neglected .",
    "in this case , the analysed process can be depicted making use of the following momentum operator @xcite .",
