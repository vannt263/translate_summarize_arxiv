    "it is commonly agreed that at high spacetime curvatures , when the quantum effects of the gravitational field become significant , general relativity needs to be replaced by a quantum theory of gravity . in spite of progress in several directions , finding this new theory has proven a challenging problem for several decades .",
    "current research in the field is paying substantial attention to the numerous indications that gravity may only be emergent , meaning that it is a collective , or thermodynamical , description of microscopic physics in which we do not encounter geometric or gravitational degree of freedom .",
    "an analogy to illustrate this point of view is fluid dynamics and the transition from from thermodynamics to the kinetic theory .",
    "what we currently know is the low energy theory , the analogue of fluid dynamics .",
    "we are looking for the microscopic theory , the analogue of the quantum molecular dynamics . just as there are no waves in the molecular theory , we may not find geometric degree of freedom in the fundamental theory . not surprisingly",
    ", this significant shift in perspective opens up new routes that may take us out of the old problems .",
    "the emergent viewpoint amounts to treating quantum gravity as a problem in statistical physics .",
    "a powerful set of methods in statistical physics involve the use of lattice - based models , such as the ising model for ferromagnetism , the hubbard model for the conductor / insulator transition , etc .",
    "such methods are starting to be introduced in quantum gravity .",
    "examples are g. volovik s work on emergent lorentz invariance at the fermi point @xcite , x .-",
    "wen s work on emergent matter and gravitons from a bosonic spin system @xcite , the emergence of a lorentzian metric and aspects of gravitation such as hawking radiation in analog models of gravity @xcite , as well as long - standing approaches such as matrix models @xcite , and more radical formulations of geometry in terms of information @xcite .",
    "it is natural for the lattice in the lattice system to play the role of ( a primitive form of ) geometry .",
    "now , general relativity is a background independent theory , by which we mean that the geometry of spacetime is fully dynamical . by analogy , we expect that the use of a fixed lattice is inappropriate and one instead needs models on a _ dynamical _ lattice . while for this reason desirable , dynamical lattices raise difficult technical problems that have not been previously addressed in the field of statistical physics . the present article is concerned with exactly this problem and presents a method that deals with dynamical lattices in certain situations .    in previous work , we introduced quantum graphity , a background independent model of spacetime in which time is an external parameter and space is described by a relational theory based on graphs @xcite .",
    "the idea is to represent locality by the adjacencies of a dynamical graph on which the diffeomorphism group is replaced , in the high energy phase , by the symmetric group on the complete graph which breaks down to its subgraphs at lower energies .",
    "these kind of models are sometimes called _ _ event - symmetric__@xcite ) .",
    "the principle of event symmetry refers to the replacement , at high energies , of the diffeomorphism group with the group of permutations of events in spacetime . in the context of quantum graphity",
    ", however , the event symmetry is only spatial , in the sense that at high energy the graph is complete and every vertex of the graph is at distance one from each other .",
    "if the dynamics is such that the system settles into a minimum energy subgraph that exhibits geometric symmetries , for instance , a discrete version of flat space in low dimension , we say that geometry emerges in that phase . in @xcite",
    "was shown that desired symmetric lattices , i.e. , discrete 2d frw , are stable local minima under certain choices of parameters in the hamiltonian ( when the effect of the matter on the lattice is neglected ) . following this work , in @xcite",
    ", we used the same concept of locality in terms of a dynamical lattice , but with a new type of matter that interacts non - linearly with the geometry , a precursor of gravity , and initiated a study of the quantum properties of that system .    in the present article",
    ", we return to the technical issues of spin systems on dynamical lattices and we introduce a method to deal with a theory of dynamical graphs on @xmath0 vertices . such graphs are subgraphs of @xmath1 , the complete graph on @xmath0 vertices .",
    "we show how , by transforming @xmath1 to its line graph , the theory can be approximated by an ising model on the line graph of a complete graph .",
    "we then use this to study the low energy properties of the quantum graphity model in @xcite . using mean field theory",
    "we calculate the average valence of the graph at low temperature and we evaluate the first corrections due to the presence of 3-loops .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the quantum graphity model @xcite with no matter . in section iii , we define the line graph derived from a generic graph and summarize its properties . in section iv , we show how , in a certain reasonable approximation , the hamiltonian of quantum graphity can be recast as an ising hamiltonian on the line graph of a complete graph . in section",
    "v , we calculate the corrections due to loops at low temperature and describe , in this framework , the behavior of the correlation function in mean field theory .",
    "conclusions follow in section vi .",
    "let us briefly introduce the quantum graphity model @xcite . as the name _",
    "graphity _ implies , quantum graphity is a model for a quantum theory of gravity in which the fundamental microstates are dynamical graphs , postulated to describe relational physics at planckian energies . there is no notion of geometry or quantum geometry at high energy , instead , geometry emerges as the system cools down and away from the planckian regime .",
    "the microstates live in a hilbert space on the complete graph @xmath2 of @xmath0 vertices , given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents the edge of the graph @xmath5 between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 vertices , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the hilbert spaces associated with edges and vertices respectively . in particular , the hilbert space associated with an edge between vertex @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "is the two - level state space : @xmath10 the two states 1,0 in ( [ hilberts ] ) are interpreted as the edge being _ on _ or _ off _ respectively .",
    "this choice means that basis states in the hilbert space of the edges represent subgraphs @xmath11 of the complete graph @xmath2 .",
    "a generic state in the hilbert space of the edges is a superposition of such subgraphs : @xmath12 in the full model of @xcite , extra degrees of freedom are assigned to the on states : @xmath13 in @xcite , and in the present work , there are no degrees of freedom associated with the vertices and hence we ignore @xmath14 .",
    "let us focus now on the state space ( [ hilberts ] ) . on the fock space of the edges we can introduce the ladder operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with the usual action : @xmath17 dynamics in quantum graphity",
    "is given by a hamiltonian acting on the graph states of the form@xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 keeps track of how many _ on _ edges are attached to a single vertex , and @xmath20 counts closed paths in the graph .",
    "the interaction term will not be used in the following , but in a generic model these terms produce alexander moves on the graph .    in more detail ,",
    "the term @xmath19 is usually chosen to be of the form : @xmath21 where the indices @xmath22 enumerate vertices , @xmath23 is the usual number operator , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are free couplings that we assume to be positive .",
    "the purpose of this term is to ensure that at low energies the system has a ( low temperature ) phase in which the average vertex valence ( i.e.  _ on _ edges attached to a vertex ) is @xmath26 . later on in the paper we will show that , at least in the mean field theory approximation , this is indeed the case . the term @xmath20 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are couplings assumed to be positive .",
    "the operator @xmath30 counts the number of non - retracing paths of length l based at the vertex @xmath6 .",
    "this operator is related to the trace of the adjacency matrix in the original model .",
    "we will build this operator in another way in the following . for @xmath31 , so that higher length loops contribute less than short length loops , this term is semi - local .",
    "the @xmath32 comes from the expansion of the exponential of the loop - path operator@xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath29 determines the length on which loop size is peaked at low energies .    in what follows",
    "we introduce a new method to analyze dynamical lattices , by transforming @xmath2 to its _ line graph _ which we define in the next section .",
    "the _ on / off _ edges of @xmath2 will become ising spins on the _ fixed _ line graph , so that standard methods of statistical physics can be used .",
    "we start by defining line graphs .",
    "let @xmath33 denote a graph with vertex set @xmath34 and edge set @xmath35 .",
    "the line graph @xmath36 is the graph of the adjacencies of @xmath37 , containing information on the connectivity of the original graph .",
    "each vertex @xmath38 corresponds to an edge @xmath39 .",
    "two vertices @xmath40 and @xmath41 in @xmath42 are adjacent if and only if the edges in g corresponding to @xmath40 and @xmath41 share a vertex .",
    "the correspondence between @xmath37 and @xmath43 is not one to one . from a given graph @xmath37",
    "we can construct only one @xmath43 but it is not true that any graph is a line graph .",
    "in fact , according to the beineke classification , there are 9 non - minimal graphs that are not line graphs of another graph and each graph containing them is not a line graph@xcite .",
    "the simplest example of a line graph is depicted in fig .",

    "we will show how the graphity hamiltonian can be recast on the line graph using ( [ pij ] ) and ( [ kirchhoff ] ) .",
    "since in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) we neglect the terms in which vertices are interacting because we assume there are no degrees of freedom on them , one could expect that it can be rewritten only in terms of the connectivity of the graph . to carry out such a reformulation ,",
    "let us expand the first term in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for small values of the parameter @xmath25 : @xmath59 as we will see later , such an expansion does not modify the properties of the model at low temperature .",
    "the first term in ( [ exp ] ) is an energy shift and , for what is to come , can be neglected",

    "we wish to extend this formalism to a dynamical graph . in order to do that we return to the hilbert space formulation of the graph with _ on / off _ edges .",
    "recall that any graph on @xmath0 vertices is a subgraph of the complete graph @xmath1 , with some edges _",
    "off_. thus , since we can always map a graph on a complete graph , we can count paths on any graph by modifying ( [ interacting2 ] ) so that it counts paths of only _ on _ edges on the corresponding complete graph . to do so ,",
    "we introduce in the sum the number operators @xmath101 in the following way : @xmath102 this term does not contribute if any of the two edges @xmath103 is off .",

    "also note that , by the symmetry of the complete graph , the number of non - retracing loops based on two neighboring edges must be the same for each pair of edges @xmath129,@xmath130 sharing a node .",

    "the combinatorial quantity @xmath134 is then the number of non - retracing loops of length @xmath120 passing from two consecutive fixed edges on the complete graph of @xmath0 vertices , as can be easily checked . the special case ( [ property2b ] ) follows from the fact that if we fix two edges there is only one edge which closes the 3-loop .",

    "having rewritten the hamiltonian in an ising fashion , we now can approach the problem of finding a graph observable and its equilibrium distribution using mean field theory . as we will see , the natural graph observable to consider is the average valence of the graph .",

    "we must keep in mind that the starting hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) was constructed in such a way that the average valence at zero temperature was a fixed value of the parameter @xmath26 at finite @xmath0",
    ". we can now use ( [ eqdist ] ) to check if this is the case . to do so , we taylor expand both sides and match the zeroth and first order coefficients on the left and right hand side of the equation .",
    "that is , we start with the expansion @xmath170 and , for the approximation to be consistent at @xmath171 , we require analyticity of the order parameter ( this has to be the case for a finite volume system in ordinary statistical mechanics , which is the case for finite @xmath0 ) .",
    "we then require that inside the exponential of equation ( [ eqdist ] ) the temperature independent terms in the numerator cancel out so that at @xmath171 the exponent is well defined .",
    "this gives the second order equation in @xmath85 : @xmath172 now note that , while this equation has two solutions , we need to only look for the one which is analytical in the parameters of the model and tends smoothly to the solution @xmath173 in the @xmath174 limit .",

    "however , we have to remember that we are just approximating the real system with a semi - classical analog . we then simply interpret the above result as the fact that the system reaches the ground state very quickly when the temperature approaches zero .",

    "inverting equation ( [ toinvert ] ) , we obtain @xmath201 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 is an effective constant in front of the ising term of the hamiltonian : @xmath204 it is interesting to note that , thanks to property ( [ property2a ] ) , we can sum all the loop terms up to a finite number @xmath205 in the hamiltonian if we assume the mean field theory approximation . inserting the couplings , we find @xmath206 it is interesting to note that in the limit @xmath207 , or @xmath208 ( where @xmath159 tends to a finite number for @xmath165 ) , this effective constant tends to @xmath209 . we interpret this as the fact that at low temperature the loops become less and less important and the model is dominated by the ising term . in particular , since the external `` magnetic '' field is given by @xmath26 and is assumed to be nonzero , it is not surprising that at @xmath171 the average valence , the equivalent `` magnetization '' , approaches this value .",
    "we note that the @xmath210 limit does not behave well unless @xmath123 .",
    "higher loops are highly non - local objects . for a given pair of edges ,",
    "all the @xmath120-loops based on these edges span the whole graph already at @xmath211 , while of course this is not the case for @xmath212-loops . as a result , in formula ( [ effective2 ] )",
    "there is a factor proportional to @xmath213 which is not present at @xmath123 .",
    "the quantum graphity model @xcite allows for degenerate _ on _ states on the edges or the vertices of the graph .",
    "degeneracy of edge states is necessary , for instance , in order to have emergent matter via the string - net condensation mechanism of levin and wen .",
    "degeneracy requires modifying our calculations above and we will address it in this subsection .    the first possible generalization of the quantum graphity model is to introduce a hilbert space on the edges of the form ( [ fermhilb ] ) : @xmath214 this changes the degeneracy number in equation ( [ entropy ] ) . with @xmath215 and @xmath216 , we obtain @xmath153=-\\log(\\frac{m_\\beta^3}{1-m_\\beta})-2.\\ ] ] the equilibrium distribution solves this equation . if we put @xmath217 - 2)]$ ] , we have @xmath218 obtained from the only real solution of the third order polynomial equation @xmath219 .    using the same procedure as before ,",
    "it is easy to see that equation ( [ cond1 ] ) remains unchanged : the low energy average valence is the same in both cases .",
    "however , the first derivative , that is , the coefficient of the @xmath168 term in the taylor expansion of the average valence in the temperature , changes , so that @xmath220 ( with the obvious notation for the two coefficients ) .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood using the following argument . at high temperature ,",
    "the two models behave in the same way , forcing the valence to be high .",
    "when the temperature drops , @xmath159 also goes down .",
    "while in the ( 1,1 ) case the phase space of the _ on _ edges is the same as that of the _ off _ edges , in the ( 3,1 ) case the system prefers to stay in the _ on _ state .",
    "thus , when the temperature decreases the system ( 3,1 ) is , at first , slowly converging to the ground state , but at @xmath171 it is forced to go to the ground state . for this reason",
    "the function @xmath159 has a greater derivative near @xmath171 in the ( 3,1 ) case .",
    "in this paper we introduced a technique to map the quantum graphity hamiltonian on the line graph of a complete graph .",
    "this procedure requires the introduction of the kirchhoff matrix of a graph and the @xmath50-string matrices related to these .",
    "this mapping is general and not specific to quantum graphity . using this mapping in a weak coupling approximation of the model , the mean field theory approximation and the low temperature expansion , we studied the properties of the model near zero temperature after having identified the average degree as a order parameter .",
    "we found that the model is dual to an ising model with external nonzero magnetic field if we neglect the interaction terms due to loops .",
    "in particular , we showed that the average valence is naturally a good order parameter for the mean field theory approximation and we found , implicitly , its average distribution using the mapped hamiltonian and the mean field theory approximation for the 3-loop term .",
    "we then studied the susceptibility function and showed how the duality with the ising model can help to interpret the results .",
    "in particular , the parameter @xmath26 plays the role of the external magnetic field . since @xmath26 is assumed to be never zero , the model has no phase transition and at @xmath171 the system goes to the ground state as expected .",
    "in fact , we found that at zero temperature the mean valence is determined by the parameter @xmath26 and we approximated the first order correction , showing the dependence on the coupling constants of the model .",
    "while these results were expected on general grounds , the mapping used here simplified the problem and allowed a quantitative analysis .",
    "what emerged from the study of the average distribution for the valence is that , if the vertex valence term dominates ( @xmath221 ) , the loop term corrections to the average valence of the ground state are suppressed at @xmath171 .",
    "we found the dependence on the coupling constants explicitly .",
    "this result is confirmed by the study of the susceptibility .",
    "thanks to the mean field theory approximation , we found the contribution of all loops to the susceptibility and showed that the susceptibility function tends to the ising one when @xmath168 approaches zero .",
    "we then applied this procedure to the degenerate case , and showed that the degeneracy does not change the average valence at low temperature but only the speed with which this ground state is reached .",
    "as a final remark , we stress that the vertex valence is an important quantity in the model .",
    "in fact , as shown in @xcite using the lieb - robinson bound , the speed with which information can propagate on graphs is bounded by a valence - dependent quantity .",
    "for this reason , as the temperature drops , the speed of the emergent light field must drop with the valence .",
    "we would like to stress that we assumed that the system was at equilibrium with an external bath .",
    "the problem of the required external bath in the model has been studied in @xcite , where additional degrees of freedom ( bosonic particles on vertices ) were introduced to let the system thermalize and reach an equilibrium distribution .",
