    "we are living exciting times in cosmology .",
    "roughly 15 years after the discovery of the inconsistency of a @xmath15 universe with the magnitude - redshift observed relation for the type ia supernova @xcite , many cosmological probes have pointed towards the universe passing through a phase of accelerated expansion : the cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( e.g. @xcite ) , the baryonic acoustic oscillations @xcite , the clustering of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) and the growth of massive galaxy clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , among others .    one possible explanation for this acceleration can be postulated by introducing a new energy component in the form of a dark energy with negative pressure ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the dark energy task force ( detf , @xcite ) has been created , urging the cosmology community to invest its effort in understanding the origin and nature of the dark energy .    with this goal in mind ,",
    "a number of surveys have been planned for the upcoming years intending to constrain the values of the dark energy by a factor of @xmath1610 times better than at present ( the so - called stage iv surveys , @xcite ) .",
    "some of these surveys , cited in chronological order of predicted start off , are : the javalambre physics of the accelerating universe astrophysical survey ( j - pas @xcite ) , the dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi , @xcite ) survey , the large synoptic sky telescope ( lsst , @xcite ) survey , the euclid @xcite survey and the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) , among many others . for an excellent review of some of these surveys , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "these surveys will follow complementary observational strategies , allowing constraints covering different regions of the cosmological parameter space for testing competing cosmological models .",
    "@xcite recently explored the properties of the photometric redshift capabilities we may expect for the euclid and lsst surveys , showing their different behaviours . in this work",
    ", we explore the unique photometric capability of the impending j - pas multiple ( @xmath6 50 ) narrow - band survey now being commissioned .",
    "this survey samples the optical spectrum with 54 narrow - bands of @xmath17 , providing photometric redshift accuracies close to what we would expect for a low resolution spectroscopic survey , where emission and absorption features will be detected photometrically .",
    "this kind of data , in the frontier between spectroscopic and photometric surveys , has never been explored before and it will allow us to reliably map the large - scale structure in 3d down to fainter magnitudes and larger areas than previous spectroscopic samples . to realise the full scientific potential of these data , new algorithms and techniques",
    "are being developed and tested and cosmological constraints will be forecasted @xcite .    in particular , we focus on the expected performance of j - pas for galaxy clusters and groups related to cosmology . clusters , by virtue of their extreme masses are of great importance for the purpose of setting cosmology constraints and the study of the large - scale structure ( e.g. @xcite or see for a review @xcite ) .",
    "modeling accurately the cluster selection function and the uncertainties in the observable- theoretical mass relation is of major importance for extracting cosmological information from j - pas .",
    "the amplitude of the cluster power - spectrum ( e.g @xcite and references herein ) is expected to be rapidly evolving over the redshift range accessible to j - pas ( z@xmath21.5 ) , hence becoming very sensitive to the growth rate of structure ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "presently , only relatively weak constraints are derived from redshift space distortions ( e.g. sdss , wiggle - z , boss , etc ) and even less derived from massive clusters owing to the current difficulties of completing even modest sized surveys with sufficient redshift information .",
    "furthermore , current wide angle surveys sensitive to clusters through weak lensing ( wl ) , x - ray measurements or the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect are still dealing with alleviating the tension between the different scaling of the sz , wl and x - ray observable mass and the theoretical cluster mass in order to make the connection to the cosmological predictions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "numerous techniques have been developed to detect galaxy clusters using x - ray data , the sz effect , wl or optical / ir data ( see @xcite and references herein ) , being their selection function carefully modeled .",
    "for the optical and ir techniques , there is a large diversity of selection functions depending on the technique or the survey considered ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , only few surveys with large number of medium or narrow - bands ( i.e. good photometric redshift resolution ) had their cluster samples fully exploited ( cosmos , @xcite ; alhambra , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the selection function of clusters in narrow - band surveys such as j - pas are still in the process of being explored .    in this paper we provide a comprehensive estimate of the cluster selection function for j - pas , accounting for the expected photometric limits and redshift accuracy of our multi - narrow - bands .",
    "it must be stressed that j - pas provides near optimal efficiency for separating cluster members from foreground and background galaxies because of its photometric redshift precision .",
    "this accuracy of the photometric redshifts is matched to the typical velocity dispersion of massive clusters , and therefore we can detect clusters above the noise to much lower masses and to higher redshifts than the wide - field surveys using conventional filters .",
    "this cluster selection function will be useful not only for providing cosmological forecasts from cluster counts but also for performing extended studies on galaxy evolution and large - scale structure in clusters    the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    " 2 , we describe j - pas , the survey used in this paper , giving an overview of its main characteristics .",
    "3 describes the simulation used in this work , the original mock catalogue and the posterior modification with ` photreal ` intended to mimic the photometry and photometric redshifts realistically . in section",
    " 4 , we describe the photometric redshift properties of the j - pas data and compare with other next - generation surveys such as the lsst and euclid . section  5 presents the results of detecting galaxy clusters in these mocks .",
    "it first provides an explanation of the bayesian cluster finder , the cluster detector used in this work .",
    "then , it shows the results regarding the cluster selection function expected from the j - pas - mock catalogue and it finally models the cluster observable - halo mass relation and its evolution with redshift .",
    "finally , we draw conclusions of the work in section  6 .",
    "the cosmology adopted throughout this paper is @xmath18 @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , corresponding to the cosmology assumed in the millennium simulation used in this work for consistency .",
    "all the magnitudes in this work are provided in the ab system @xcite .",
    "the javalambre - physics of the accelerating universe astrophysical survey ( j - pas , @xcite ) is the first stage iv survey , starting in 2016 .",
    "the observations will be taken from the javalambre survey telescope ( jst / t250 ) , a new fully dedicated 2.5 m telescope located at the observatorio astrofsico de javalambre in teruel ( spain ) , using jpcam , a panoramic camera with a mosaic of 14 large - format ccds amounting to 1200 mpix , that provides an effective field of view of @xmath244.7deg@xmath1 ( see @xcite ) .    with the main purpose of constraining the dark energy parameters with at least 10 times higher precision than present surveys , j - pas will image @xmath0 8500 @xmath25 of the northern sky with 54 narrow - band filters plus 2 medium - band and 3 broad - band @xmath26-like filters in the whole optical range .",
    "each narrow - band filter will have a width of @xmath27 and will be spaced by 100 .",
    "the filter transmission curves of the 54 narrow - band overlapping filters plus the two medium - band filters for j - pas are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmissioncurves ] ( see also @xcite ) . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the five broad - band filters of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "as we can see , the optical wavelength range for a low - redshift object will be sampled with more than 50 data points allowing , not only to recover a good estimation of the photometric redshift , but also to infer intrinsic properties of the galaxies .",
    "the expected depth of the survey ( 5@xmath28 detection magnitudes ) for all the different bands are provided in tables 3 - 5 in @xcite from realistic simulations using the characteristics of the telescope , camera and site .",
    "in addition , we have created a synthetic @xmath29-band as a combination of the narrow - band filters of the survey , by following a similar procedure to that described in @xcite for the alhambra survey .",
    "this has been made in order to use the same pass - band to detect galaxy clusters as some other work in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "due to the large coverage of the visible spectrum , the expected photometric redshift accuracy will be @xmath30 for more than @xmath31 galaxies down to the flux limit of the survey @xcite .",
    "this photometric redshift resolution makes this survey comparable to a low resolution integral field unity ( ifu ) of the northern sky .",
    "the excellent photometric redshift precision that j - pas will achieve , makes this survey ideal for characterizing the overall galaxy population in terms of colours , morphology or chemical composition and therefore , for determining the cluster galaxy membership .",
    "in this paper , we use a mock catalogue generated by using the same procedure as in @xcite .",
    "indeed , we use the 500 @xmath25 wide mock cone catalogue by @xcite designed to mimic euclid and , we transform it into a j - pas mock catalogue by using ` photreal ` .",
    "this technique , described in @xcite , obtains a new photometry and photometric error set for a particular survey to reproduce the observational properties of the galaxies with fidelity . after that ,",
    "photometric redshifts have been derived by using bpz2.0 ( @xcite , bentez et al . in prep ) . in this section ,",
    "we give a brief description of the mock catalogue construction .",
    "we use a mock catalogue constructed from the millennium dark matter simulation @xcite . the dark matter",
    "haloes have been populated with galaxies created through the semi - analytic galaxy formation model galform @xcite .",
    "the light - cone is built from different simulation s snapshots up to @xmath32 , allowing for interpolation between snapshots in order to properly model the evolution of structures along the line of sight . for a detailed explanation ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the solid angle of the cone used is 500 @xmath25 , which is @xmath24 16 times smaller than the actual surveyed area of j - pas . while this fact does not affect the recovery of the photometric redshift accuracy ; it might cause the absence of some rare , very massive clusters .",
    "however , these clusters are always well - identified through different techniques and for the purpose of characterizing the selection function , the results will remain virtually unchanged .",
    "the mock catalogue contains a large quantity of physical parameters related with the dark matter haloes ( namely : dark matter mass , dark matter i d , center of halo , galaxies belonging to each halo ) and the galaxies ( galaxy i d , ra , dec , redshift , mass of cold gas , quiescent sfr in disk , stellar mass of galaxy , among others ) .",
    "the catalogue also includes spectroscopic redshifts , defined as the cosmological redshift with peculiar velocities added .",
    "finally , the photometry of the galaxies in the five @xmath26 sdss broad - bands together with some other different bands mimicking euclid and other surveys are also included . unfortunately",
    ", no information on the original spectrum was kept due to disk space issues .",
    "while this fact makes a direct comparison impossible , we can obtain an estimation of their spectral type by fitting the photometry to a library of templates , as detailed in  3.2 .      while the advantages of these semi - analytic mock catalogues are crearly recognized , well - known issues have been widely reported in the literature related to unrealistic galaxy",
    "colours @xcite .",
    "many of these issues consequently lead to an overestimation of the mean dispersion of the photometric redshifts @xcite and flawed stellar mass estimations @xcite .",
    "some of these disagreements for the mock catalogues have been reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these issues , together with the lack of photometric errors in the original mock catalogue motivated us to create a new mock catalogue that reproduces the properties of the observed galaxies as well as their photometric redshift precision in all the bands of j - pas .    in order to do this , we apply ` photreal ` ( @xcite , bentez et al . in prep . ) .",
    "this procedure , already applied in several papers @xcite , ensures the accurate reproduction of the magnitudes , colours and photometric redshifts of the galaxies . in this section",
    ", we provide a brief summary of the method . for further details ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and bentez et al . in prep .",
    "` photreal ` first obtains an estimate of the spectral type of the original catalogue by matching the original rest - frame mock photometry to a well - calibrated library of galaxy templates .",
    "this library includes eight different empirical templates representing a complete representation of the colors of any galaxy populations sampled by j - pas ( bentez , private communication ) .",
    "indeed , this library represents the observed properties of the alhambra and cosmos surveys with an outlier rate of @xmath24 1 - 2% @xcite .",
    "once we have a realistic representation of the spectral type distribution of the original mock catalogue , we generate photometry in the different j - pas bands by using their filter response and with their expected depths @xcite .",
    "we include an empirically calibrated systematic error of about 7% .",
    "this error remains constant with magnitude and seems to be intrinsic to the galaxy colors in multi - band photometry .",
    "furthermore , photometric and instrumental errors are added to these magnitudes .",
    "the photometric errors are estimated as in @xcite from the telescope response and are normalized to the j - pas depths in each band .",
    "thereafter , we run ` bpz2.0 ` on the new photometry to obtain photometric redshifts and redshift probability distribution functions , @xmath33",
    ".    one might claim that the use of the same library could be introducing an optimistic behavior of the performance of the photometric redshifts .",
    "however , we checked that this was not the case in a previous work @xcite .",
    "first of all , we ensured that the photometry generated with ` photreal ` was very similar to the one observed in the literature , which if any , it should make the derived photometric redshifts more realistic .",
    "secondly , we checked that the photometric redshifts derived from this photometry perfectly matched with the photometric dispersion and bias measurement in real data .",
    "for example , we measured the original photometric redshift dispersion of the mock catalogue generated for the advanced large , homogeneous area medium band redshift astronomical survey ( alhambra , @xcite ) data , finding it to be three times higher than the one expected from real data @xcite . after applying ` photreal ` ,",
    "the photometric redshift dispersion exactly matched the data expectations @xcite .",
    "note that the choice of the library was motivated from an excellent calibration of the template library in representing @xmath698% of the known galaxies .",
    "moreover , possible interpolations between their templates are allowed when obtaining photometric redshifts .",
    "in this section , we describe the performance of the photometric redshifts estimated for j - pas obtained from the mock catalog described in section  3 .",
    "following @xcite , we define the photometric redshift dispersion as :    @xmath34    where the difference @xmath35 is defined as the photometric redshift bias ( see @xcite and references herein ) and @xmath36 and @xmath37 refer to the bayesian photometric and the spectroscopic redshifts respectively .    the overall photometric redshift dispersion obtained for the global j - pas mock sample is @xmath38 , equivalent to @xmath39 km s@xmath40 .",
    "[ fig : zszb ] shows the normalized density plot of the spectroscopic redshift versus photometric redshift for all the sample .",
    "it is noticeable the tightness of the relation as expected from the excellent spectrum coverage of j - pas .",
    "in addition , figs [ fig : deltazmag ] and [ fig : sigmazz ] show the density plot of the relation of the photometric redshift bias ( upper panel ) and dispersion ( bottom panel ) as a function of magnitude and redshift , respectively .",
    "we complement this information with the first two columns of tables [ tab : photozmag ] and [ tab : photozz ] , showing the photometric redshift precision and photometric redshift bias as a function of magnitude and redshift , respectively .",
    "the photometric redshift bias keeps well below 0.0015 up to @xmath41 mag and @xmath42 , at least .",
    "the photometric redshift dispersion remains below 0.003 up to @xmath43 mag and up to @xmath14 .",
    "this performance is markedly better than similar next - generation surveys in the same range of redshift and magnitude @xcite , as we discuss in  4.2 , putting in evidence the very good behavior of a pseudo - spectra - like survey as j - pas .",
    "we can argue that the utilized mock catalogues might be too simplistic and therefore unrealistic since they do not include other sources of errors except the photometric errors .",
    "however , as seen in previous analysis based on real data such as the alhambra survey @xcite , other sources of errors such as those coming , for instance , from the chosen library of templates , has a small impact on the results .",
    "therefore , we are confident that the present results in this work represent a realistic expectation of the capacity of the j - pas survey .     versus spectroscopic redshift @xmath37 for the overall j - pas sample , colour - coded by normalized density .",
    "the photometric redshift dispersion is quoted .",
    "the j - pas photometric redshift will perform with a similar resolution to this obtained for low - resolution spectra up to redshift 1.2 . ]",
    "we have also characterized the rate of outliers expected in the survey . to do this ,",
    "we have chosen to use two different definitions as in @xcite .",
    "first , we call a galaxy an outlier if it satisfies the following condition :    @xmath44    hence , the rate of outliers , @xmath45 , is defined as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 refers to the total number of galaxies .",
    "we decided to use this definition since it has been the referred quantity in a large number of papers in the literature for historical reasons ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , this definition becomes kind of arbitrary , particularly for surveys with a large - number of narrow - medium bands .",
    "hence , we also use the definition of an outlier galaxy , as that accomplishing the following condition :    @xmath48    as already introduced in @xcite . as before ,",
    "the rate of outliers , @xmath49 , is defined as @xmath50    the solid lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : outmag ] and [ fig : outz ] display the rate of outliers ( @xmath45 top panel , @xmath49 bottom panel ) expected for j - pas as a function of magnitude and redshift respectively .",
    "also , these values are collected in the third and fourth columns in tables [ tab : photozmag ] and [ tab : photozz ] , respectively .",
    "the rate of outliers becomes almost negligible ( @xmath511% down to i@xmath24 22.5 and @xmath523% down to i@xmath2421.5 ) and it increases up to @xmath514% and up to @xmath5213.7% down to i@xmath2423 .",
    "this rate is slightly higher ( @xmath515% and @xmath5212.5% ) up to z@xmath240.8 , as expected from the inclusion of fainter low - redshift galaxies in this sample .",
    "these values are significantly ( @xmath245 - 20 times ) smaller than the values that other next - generation surveys will achieve @xcite , in agreement with what it is expected for surveys with a large number of narrow - band filter @xcite .",
    "a more detailed comparison is performed in  4.2 .",
    "( top panel ) and @xmath49 ( bottom panel ) as a function of magnitude for three different j - pas samples : the overall sample ( solid line ) , the 50% best quality photometric redshift sample ( dotted line ) and the 25% best quality photometric redshift sample ( dashed line ) .",
    "the outliers rate is very small ( @xmath511% and @xmath526.5% ) down to @xmath53 , increasing to higher rates at fainter magnitudes for the overall sample , and for all the 50% and 25% best quality j - pas samples . ]",
    "( top panel ) and @xmath49 ( bottom panel ) as a function of redshift for three different j - pas samples : the overall sample ( solid line ) , the 50% best quality photometric redshift sample ( dotted line ) and the 25% best quality photometric redshift sample ( dashed line ) .",
    "the @xmath45 outliers rate keeps below 5% for the overall sample ( @xmath54 ) down to @xmath55 and almost negligible ( @xmath45 and @xmath521% ) for the 50% and 25% best quality j - pas samples . ]",
    "complementarily , @xcite introduced an indicator of the quality of the photometric redshift of a survey with a parameter called _",
    "odds_. this parameter is defined as the integral of the full redshift probability @xmath33 centered in the maximum peak of the probability within a given interval :    @xmath56    and it becomes a very useful quantity to select the best quality photo - z samples .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : zszbodd ] , we show the recovery of photometric redshifts for the j - pas survey for the 50% best quality _ odds _ sample , which have a mean dispersion of 0.0018 .",
    "we also display the rate of outliers for the 50% and 25% best _ odds _ samples as a function of magnitude and redshift in figs [ fig : outmag ] and [ fig : outz ] respectively .",
    "likewise , in tables [ tab : photozmag ] and [ tab : photozz ] , we list the photometric redshift precision , the photometric redshift bias and the rate of outliers , @xmath45 and @xmath49 , as a function of magnitude and redshift , respectively , for different _ odds _ cuts .     versus spectroscopic redshift @xmath37 for the j - pas sample resulting after selecting the 50% best quality photometric redshifts in the sample , selected through the _ odds _ parameter ( see the text for an explanation ) , colour - coded by normalized density .",
    "the photometric redshift dispersion is quoted .",
    "this dispersion is comparable to that obtained for a low - resolution spectroscopic survey . ]    while the global photometric redshift dispersion , @xmath57 remains below 0.003 down to @xmath58 , performing a selection of the 50% highest _ odds _ allows the mean photometric redshift dispersion to decrease down to 0.0015 or to even smaller values down to @xmath59 .",
    "in the same way , the overall outliers rate , @xmath45 ( @xmath49 ) , remains below 1% ( 6.3% ) for magnitude @xmath60 mag but it increases to @xmath64% ( @xmath614% ) at deeper magnitudes than this",
    ". an _ odds _ cut leaving 50% of the sample , automatically reduces the outliers rate to @xmath511% and @xmath522% down to @xmath61 and to @xmath510.25% and @xmath520.5% down to @xmath59 if we consider the 25% best quality _ odds _ galaxies in the sample .",
    "@xmath62 [ tab : photozmag ]    similarly , the overall photometric redshift resolution remains below @xmath63 up to redshift 0.8 , increasing at higher redshifts .",
    "however , by selecting the 50% best quality _ odds _ sample , these values remain @xmath20.0015 up to redshift 1.0 . more strikingly",
    ", while the @xmath45 outlier rates range between 3% and 11% and @xmath49 between 8% and 23% for the whole redshift range , selecting the best 50% of the sample can decrease these assessments to less than 1% and 2% for @xmath45 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "@xmath64 [ tab : photozz ]      we compare our results with those shown in @xcite for the lsst and euclid surveys .",
    "the authors considered two euclid surveys consisting of the three infrared @xmath65 euclid bands and two different optical counterparts .",
    "the so - called euclid - pessimistic includes the five @xmath66 des optical bands as the optical counterpart and the euclid - optimistic includes the previously mentioned five optical des bands and the 6 @xmath67 lsst deep optical bands .",
    "for further details on these surveys , we refer the reader to @xcite .    in order to be consistent in our comparison and to use the same definition of outlier , we only use @xmath45 in this subsection and refer to it as @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparisonphotoz ] , we show the mean photometric redshift bias , the mean photometric redshift dispersion and the mean outlier rate ( top , middle and bottom panel , respectively ) as a function of the i - band magnitude ( for the j - pas and lsst surveys ) , h - band magnitude ( for the euclid surveys ) and redshift ( left , centre and right panel , respectively ) .",
    "we find that the photometric redshift bias as a function of the i - band magnitude obtained for j - pas is @xmath6100 times smaller than those found for the lsst .",
    "the values found for the euclid - optimistic as a function of the h - band magnitude are @xmath65 times smaller than those found for the euclid - pessimistic . comparing the photometric redshift bias as a function of redshift , the values found for j - pas are a factor 1 - 20 smaller than those found for the lsst and euclid - pessimistic and in the same range of magnitude as those found for the euclid - optimistic survey .    the mean photometric redshift dispersion for the j - pas survey is more than a factor of 20 smaller than the lsst and euclid - pessimistic survey , and more than a factor of 10 smaller for the euclid - optimistic survey for similar magnitudes ranges .",
    "these differences remain similar , although slightly smaller , when we consider it as a function of redshift , up to redshift @xmath21 . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the photometric redshift dispersion increases almost exponentially for the j - pas survey .",
    "finally , the rate of outliers for the j - pas survey as a function of magnitude is more than 15 times smaller than for the lsst and euclid - pessimistic and similar to the euclid - optimistic survey down to @xmath53 .",
    "however , the j - pas outliers rate becomes comparable to the lsst values ( @xmath24 3 - 5% ) as a function of redshift and higher than the ones expected for the euclid - optimistic survey .",
    "the results discussed in this section illustrate that the different observational strategies of the next - generations surveys provide different photometric redshift performances .",
    "for instance , deep ir surveys such as euclid will allow to reach high redshift regimes and very deep optical surveys , such as the lsst , will sample a wide range of the luminosity function , reaching very deep magnitudes .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , although somewhat counterintuitive , medium and narrow band filter systems produce much more robust photometric redshifts , and there much larger photometric redshift depth , than broad - band systems reaching higher s / n .",
    "indeed , only the surveys that use the combination of multiple bands ( e.g j - pas or euclid - optimistic ) will reach very small bias and outliers rates .",
    "in addition , if these bands are narrow and cover the whole optical spectrum as j - pas will do , the photometric redshift dispersion will be reduced to very low - levels down to the depth limit of the survey .",
    "the bayesian cluster finder , ( bcf , @xcite ) is an optical / ir galaxy cluster detector , which was developed with the purpose of detecting galaxy clusters independently of the presence or absence of a red sequence or a central dominant brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) but using this information if it is present . in other words",
    ", the algorithm uses the presence of a red sequence or a dominant bcg if present , but it can still detect galaxy clusters or groups if this information is absent . in this section ,",
    "we summarise the main details of the method and we refer the reader to the original work for further details .    the bcf first calculates the probability at a given redshift that there is a cluster with a determined density and luminosity profile centered on each galaxy , including different priors related to the colour - magnitude relation of the cluster or the bcg magnitude - redshift relation .",
    "then , we perform a search in a predefined number of redshift slices , where the minimum threshold comes from the minimum redshift we can resolve ( usually determined from the geometry of the survey for small area surveys or 0 , otherwise ) and the maximum redshift is obtained from the wavelength coverage and the depth of the survey .",
    "the bin width is fixed according to the expected photometric resolution of the survey .",
    "for instance , we fix the photometric redshift resolution to 0.01 for the j - pas survey .",
    "effects of stars and masking of edges of the frames have been incorporated .",
    "then , clusters are selected as the density peaks of those probability maps and the center is located at the peak of the probability .",
    "finally , if we find two or more detections with separations less than 0.5 mpc in projected space and up to two bins in redshift space , we merge them into a single one .",
    "the bcf has been applied to a number of optical surveys in the literature : a wide ( 141 @xmath25 ) survey , the cfhtls - archive research survey ( cars , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; a very deep ( r@xmath2427.5 mag depth ) survey , the deep lens survey ( dls , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; and a 20 medium - band survey , the alhambra survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "we remark different performances as a function of the different properties of the data .",
    "particularly , we see that multiple narrow - band surveys such as the alhambra survey are better at resolving the galactic population and therefore , at increasing the purity rates and setting a lower mass limit threshold for detecting clusters and groups .      in this work ,",
    "we apply the bcf to our j - pas mock catalogue . in order to assess the performance of the bcf on the j - pas mock data , we match the original mock sample to the recovered sample following the same friends - of - friends ( fof , @xcite ) algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "this procedure searches for each detection found in the recovered sample candidates or friends in the original mock catalogue whose centers are placed within a comoving distance of 3 mpc including the photometric redshift errors .",
    "then , a search of fof is done until no more candidates are found .",
    "afterwards , the candidate with the closest photometric redshift to the original detection is selected . finally ,",

    "<S> the impending javalambre physics of the accelerating universe astrophysical survey ( j - pas ) will be the first wide - field survey of @xmath0 8500 deg@xmath1 to reach the ` stage iv ' category . because of the redshift resolution afforded by 54 narrow - band filters , j - pas is particularly suitable for cluster detection in the range z@xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric redshift dispersion is estimated to be only @xmath3 with few outliers @xmath4 4% for galaxies brighter than @xmath5 </S>",
