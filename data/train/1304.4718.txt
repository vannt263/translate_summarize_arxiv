    "the mott transition takes place slightly below the band width @xmath199 and is of the second order .",
    "the spectral density of the self - energy is featureless below the mott transition point ( metallic phase ) , but in the mott insulator phase , it becomes dominated by single pole of a definite dispersion , which yields the mott gap .",
    "a detailed study on the nature of the pm state between the af and afc states , such as the dimer phase , is an interesting subject , but it is unfortunately beyond the scope of vca .",
