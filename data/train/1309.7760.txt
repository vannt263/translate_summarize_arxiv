    "compared to the analysis of the one - dimensional case treated in @xcite , the main difficulties in the adaptation lay in the proof of the rigidity result ( theorem [ thrig ] above ) : + - we need a very good understanding of the linearized operator of equation near the stationary solution @xmath109 ( see proposition [ propexpo ] below ) ; such an operator was studied in details in the companion paper @xcite , showing @xmath110 new degenerate directions coming from the derivatives of @xmath109 with respect to the angular directions of @xmath111 ; + - we also need to know properties of the wave operator , and such properties depend on the dimension ( e.g. strichartz estimates ) ; this is mainly done in appendix [ applemliouv ] .",
    "+ note that the derivation of theorem [ threg ] needs less adaptations of the one - dimensional case . as for theorem [ thstab ] ,",
    "some steps are similar to the proof of theorem [ threg ] , and others are original . in any case ,",
    "in the whole paper , we only sketch the steps where some adaptation is needed , and refer to @xcite for those where the adaptation is straightforward ( see section [ secreg ] below ) .",
