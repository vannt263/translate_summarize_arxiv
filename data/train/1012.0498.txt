    "recommendation systems are emerging as an important business application with significant economic impact .",
    "the data in such systems are collections of incomplete tied preferences across @xmath0 items associated with @xmath1 different users . given an incomplete tied preference associated with an additional @xmath2 user , the system recommends unobserved items to that user based on the preference relations of the @xmath2 users .",
    "currently deployed recommendation systems include book recommendations at amazon.com , movie recommendations at netflix.com , and music recommendations at pandora.com .",
    "constructing accurate recommendation systems ( that recommend to users items that are truly preferred over other items ) is important for assisting users as well as increasing business profitability .",
    "it is an important unsolved goal in machine learning and data mining .    in most cases of practical interest",
    "the number of items @xmath0 indexed by the system ( items may be books , movies , songs , etc . )",
    "is relatively high in the @xmath3 range . perhaps due the size of @xmath0 , it is almost always the case that each user observes only a small subset of the items , typically in the range 10 - 100 . as a result",
    "the preference relations expressed by the users are over a small subset of the @xmath0 items .",
    "formally , we have @xmath1 users providing incomplete tied preference relations on @xmath0 items @xmath4 where @xmath5 are sets of items ( wlog we identify items with integers @xmath6 ) defined by the following interpretation : user @xmath7 prefers all items in @xmath8 to all items in @xmath9 .",
    "the notation @xmath10 above is the number of such sets provided by user @xmath7 .",
    "the data is incomplete since not all items are necessarily observed by each user i.e. , @xmath11 and may contain ties since some items are left uncompared , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "recommendation systems recommend items to a new user , denoted as @xmath2 , based on their preference @xmath13 and its relation to the preferences of the @xmath1 users .    as an illustrative example , assuming @xmath14 , the data @xmath15 corresponds to @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . from the data",
    "we may guess that item 4 is relatively popular across the board while some users like item 8 ( users 1 , 3 ) and some hate it ( user 2 ) .",
    "given a new @xmath2 user issuing the preference @xmath25 we might observe a similar pattern of preference or taste as user 1 and recommend to the user item 8 .",
    "we may also recommend item 4 which has broad appeal resulting in the augmentation @xmath26    we note that in some cases the preference relations arise from users providing numeric scores to items .",
    "for example , if the users assign 1 - 5 stars to movies , the set @xmath8 contains all movies that user @xmath7 assigned @xmath27 stars to and @xmath28 ( assuming some movies were assigned to each of the 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 star levels ) . as pointed out by a wide variety of studies in economics and social sciences , such numeric scores are inconsistent among different users .",
    "we therefore proceed to interpret such data as ordinal rather than numeric .",
    "a substantial body of literature in computer science has addressed the problem of constructing recommendation systems .",
    "we have attempted to outline the most important and successful approaches in the related work section towards the end of this paper . however , none of these previous approaches are fully satisfactory from a statistical perspective : there are no reasonable probability models assumed to generate the data and no clear meaningful statistical estimation procedures .",
    "we substantiate this argument more fully in the related work section .    in this paper",
    "we describe a non - parametric statistical technique for estimating probabilities on preferences based on the data .",
    "this technique may be used in recommendation systems in different ways .",
    "its principal usage may be to provide a statistically meaningful estimation framework for issuing recommendations ( in conjunction with decision theory ) .",
    "however , it also leads to other important applications including mining association rules , exploratory data analysis , and clustering items and users .",
    "two key observations that we make are : ( i ) incomplete tied preference data may be interpreted as randomly censored permutation data , and ( ii ) using generating functions we are able to provide a computationally efficient scheme for computing the estimator in the case of triangular smoothing .",
    "we proceed in the next sections to describe notations and our assumptions and estimation procedure , and follow with case studies demonstrating our approach on real world recommendation systems data .",
    "we describe the following notations and conventions for permutations , which are taken from @xcite where more detail may be found .",
    "we denote a permutation by listing the items from most preferred to least separated by a @xmath29 or @xmath30 symbol : @xmath31 , e.g. @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "ranking with ties occur when judges do not provide enough information to construct a total order .",
    "in particular , we define tied rankings as a partition of @xmath34 to @xmath35 disjoint subsets @xmath36 such that all items in @xmath37 are preferred to all items in @xmath38 but no information is provided concerning the relative preference of the items among the sets @xmath37 .",
    "we denote such rankings by separating the items in @xmath37 and @xmath38 with a @xmath29 or @xmath30 notation .",
    "for example , the tied ranking @xmath39 ( items 1 and 4 are tied for last place ) is denoted as @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "ranking with missing items occur when judges omit certain items from their preference information altogether .",
    "for example assuming a set of items @xmath42 , a judge may report a preference @xmath43 , omitting altogether item 1 which the judge did not observe or experience .",
    "this case is very common in situations involving a large number of items @xmath0 . in this case",
    "judges typically provide preference only for the @xmath44 items that they observed or experienced .",
    "for example , in movie recommendation systems we may have @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "rankings can be full ( permutations ) , with ties , with missing items , or with both ties and missing items . in either case",
    "we denote the rankings using the @xmath29 or @xmath30 notation or using the disjoint sets @xmath47 notation .",
    "we also represent tied and incomplete rankings by the set of permutations that are consistent with it . for example , @xmath48 are sets of two and four permutations corresponding to tied and incomplete rankings , respectively .",
    "it is hard to directly posit a coherent probabilistic model on incomplete tied data such as .",
    "different preferences relations are not unrelated to each other : they may subsume one another ( for example @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , represent disjoint events ( for example @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , or interact in more complex ways ( for example @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "a valid probabilistic framework needs to respect the constraints resulting from the axioms of probability , e.g. , @xmath55 .",
    "our approach is to consider the incomplete tied preferences as censored permutations .",
    "that is , we assume a distribution @xmath56 over permutations @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the symmetric group of permutations of order @xmath0 ) that describes the complete without - ties preferences in the population .",
    "the data available to the recommender system is sampled by drawing @xmath1 iid permutations from @xmath59 : @xmath60 , followed by censoring to result in the observed preferences @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the probability of observing the censoring @xmath64 ( specifically , it is not equal to @xmath65 ) .",
    "although many approaches for estimating @xmath59 given @xmath61 are possible , experimental evidence point to the fact that in recommendation systems with high @xmath0 , the distribution @xmath59 does not follow a simple parametric form such as the mallows , bradley - terry , or thurstone models @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : heatmaps ] for a demonstration how parametric assumptions break down with increasing @xmath0 ) . instead , the distribution @xmath59 tends to be diffuse and multimodal with different probability mass regions corresponding to different types of judges ( for example in movie preferences probability modes may correspond to genre as fans of drama , action , comedy , etc . having similar preferences ) .

    "collaborative filtering or recommendation system has been an active research area in computer science since the 1990s .",
    "the earliest efforts made a prediction for the rating of items based on the similarity of the test user and the training users @xcite .",
    "specifically , these attempts used similarity measures such as pearson correlation @xcite and vector cosine similarity @xcite to evaluate the similarity level between different users .",
    "more recent work includes user and movie clustering @xcite , item - item similarities @xcite , bayesian networks @xcite , dependence network @xcite and probabilistic latent variable models @xcite .",
    "most recently , the state of the art methods including the winner of the netflix competition are based on non - negative matrix factorization of the partially observed user - rating matrix .",
    "the factorized matrix can be used to fill out the unobserved entries in a way similar to latent factor analysis @xcite .",
    "each of the above methods focuses exclusively on user ratings . in some cases item information",
    "is available ( movie genre , actors , directors , etc ) which have lead to several approaches that combine voting information with item information e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our method differs from the methods above in that it constructs a full probabilistic model on preferences , it is able to handle heterogeneous preference information ( not all users must specify the same number of preference classes ) and does not make any parametric assumptions .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches it enables not only the prediction of item ratings , but also the discovery of association rules and the estimation of probabilities of interesting events .",
    "estimating distributions from tied and incomplete data is a central task in many applications with perhaps the most obvious one being collaborative filtering .",
    "an accurate estimator @xmath66 enables going beyond the traditional item - rank prediction task .",
    "it can be used to compute probabilities of interest , find association rules , and perform a wide range of additional data analysis tasks .",
    "we demonstrate the first non - parametric estimator for such data that is computationally tractable i.e. , polynomial rather than exponential in @xmath0 . the computation is made possible using generating function and dynamic programming techniques .",
    "we examine the behavior of the estimator @xmath66 in three sets of experiments .",
    "the first set of experiments involves estimating probabilities of interest such as @xmath67 .",
    "the second set of experiments involves predicting preferences of held - out items which is directly applicable in recommendation systems . in this task",
    ", our estimator outperforms other memory based methods ( to which it is similar functionally ) and performs similarly to state - of - the - art methods that are based on non - negative matrix factorization . in the third set of experiments we examined the usage of the estimator in discovering association rules such as @xmath68"
