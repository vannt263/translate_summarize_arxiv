    "there has been some increasing interest in recent years in the study of controlling chaotic nonlinear systems .",
    "the possibilty of obtaining periodic waveforms from a chaotic system by stabilising any of the numerous embedded unstable periodic orbits ( upo s ) has been the guiding control philosophy .",
    "the breakthrough in this direction is the ogy algorithm @xcite , which stabilises the upo by applying ocassional , small , well calculated perturbations to the system parameters .",
    "a variation of this method is the ocassional proportional feedback ( opf ) @xcite , which gives ocassional perturbation to the system parameters , proportional to the deviation of the system away from the upo .",
    "the above methods are in essence discrete in nature , and calculates the perturbation based upon local behavior of the system in a neighborhood of the upo .",
    "this is an advantage , as knowledge about the entire global dynamics is not necessary .",
    "however since control is exercised only ocassionaly in a small neighborhood of the upo , the system becomes susceptible to ocassional bursts away from the upo under moderate noise . to overcome this limitations the idea of time continous control",
    "was proposed by pyragas @xcite . among the two algorithms suggested by pyragas one required an external periodic signal approximating the upo , while the other recovered the periodic signal by delay coordinate method . though various implementations of the second method has been reported",
    ", the inspiration behind the present report is to replace the delay element which is difficult and costly to obtain at some time scales .",
    "the present algorithm also achieves control by perturbing the system parameters in proportion to the error signal between the output signal to be controlled and a periodic signal .",
    "but the periodic signal is derived from the chaotic attractor itself , by passing the chaotic output of the system through a band pass filter with a narrow pass band .",
    "the filter may be a simple lti one , which can be implemented using resistor , capacitor and opamps only .",
    "it has been observed that though lti filters are unable to filter out a periodic signal from a chaotic one , when connected in the above configuration , the whole system can be controlled to a periodic orbit .",
    "let us consider a dynamical system given by the model : @xmath0    y&= & cpx   \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath1 is a parameter available for perturbation and @xmath2 is the output signal to be controlled.we assume both @xmath2 and @xmath1 to be scalars .",
    "the system is connected in the configuration shown in fig 1 .",
    "the filter in the feedback path is band pass type with a narrow pass band .",
    "a second order notch filter is found to be sufficient for effective control . to select the pass frequency of the filter , a fft of the output signal is obtained , which would be typically spread spectrum , with a broad peak centred around frequencies corresponding to the upo s .",
    "we select the pass frequency of filter to be within this window . a sufficiently high @xmath3 value for the filter is selected and assumed to be tunable .",
    "if the output of the filter is @xmath4 the perturbation applied to the system parameter p is of the form @xmath5 the value of gain @xmath6 is tuned to obtain stabilisation .",
    "when stabilisation is achieved the output of the filter and the system both become periodic and close to each other ; and , the perturbation @xmath7 becomes extremely small . therefore , as well as in ogy and pyragas",
    "s method small external force is used for stabilsation . also since the pass frequency of the filter",
    "was chosen to be in the same window as that of the upo s - the stabilised orbit lies in a small neighborhood of the upo of the original system .",
    "the smallness of the perturbation signal depends on how close to upo the system is stabilised and the noise level present .",
    "though general validity and sufficiency conditions for the effectiveness of the above algorithm is difficult to prove , it appears that stabilisation in the above method is achieved through additional degrees of freedom introduced into the system by the filter in the feedback loop .",
    "the filter does not change much the projection of the system dynamics into the original low dimensional state space , but change only the lyapunov exponent of the upo . as compared to the delayed feedback method suggested by pyragas @xcite , where the system dimension increases to infinity , a finite increase in system dimension occurs here",
    ", i.e. the finite dimensional lti filter aproximates the delay element in some sense .",
    "if the state space realisation of the filter is @xmath8    and the system equations for the chaotic dynamics are given by eqn [ sys ] .",
    "then the state equations for the augmented system becomes",
    "@xmath9   = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }           f(x , p_0+k(c_fx_f - c_px ) ) \\\\",
    "b_fc_px+a_fx_f           \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ]    stability of the upo s can be studied by linearising the augmented system about a fixed point and studying the singular values of the resulting jacobian matrix .",
    "it has been observed that the system could be stabilised to period-2 or higher periodic orbits if the frequency components of these orbits are close enough .",
    "stabilisation can be achieved in this case by shifting the pass frquency of the filter towards the edge of the pass window of the original system and relaxing the @xmath3 value .",
    "an alternative approach could be using parallel combination of filters .",
    "the lorentz system is used to illustrate the main results for the algorithm .",
    "the system equations for the lorentz system are given by @xmath10 \\dot x_2&=&3(x_3 $ - $ x_2)\\\\[2 mm ] \\dot x_3&=&-x_1x_2 $ + $ rx_2 $ - $ x_3 \\end{array}\\ ] ]    the state @xmath11 is selected as the output signal to be controlled and @xmath12 is the system parameter available for perturbation .",
    "the nominal value of @xmath12 is taken as @xmath13 .",
    "the second order filter with transfer function + @xmath14 + is used in the feedback loop .",
    "the fft spectrum of the output signal is shown in fig 2b . accordingly",
    "the pass frequency of the filter is choosen as @xmath15 , which lies in the pass window of the chaotic system .",
    "stabilisation of the period-1 orbit is obtained at @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "fig 3b . and 3a . shows the stabilsed output signal and the perturbation in the system parameter respectively .",
    ". shows the fft spectrum of the controlled output .    it is to be noted that the stabilised period-1 orbit is _ almost _ and not truly sinusoidal .",
    "a small harmonic component is present in the output , though topologically this can be considered an period-1 orbit .",
    "this leads to the question , whether the objective of control of chaos should be stabilisation to sinusoidal outputs , or _ not sinusoidal _ but still period-1 orbits .",
    "the answer depends on the application involved .",
    "the control algorithm suggested above offers a direct control over the harmonic content of the output signal and can modify it according to application demand .    to illustrate the validity of the algorithm for other systems the results for stabilisation of the rossler system to period-1 orbit",
    "is shown in fig 4 .",
    "local stability of the system can be studied by linearising the augmented state equations [ [ aug ] ] about the stabilised upo , and considering the singular values of the resulting jacobian matrix . for the lorentz system",
    "it is observed that the singularvalues become negative for @xmath19 $ ] for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the variation of singularvalues with @xmath6 is shown in fig 6b .",
    "the above algorithm offers in a naive form a paradigm in which the problem of control of chaotic systems can also be viewed as that of synchronisation of two back to back , mutually coupled system , of which one may be a chaotic system with numerous embedded upo s and the other may be a lti or a simpler nonlinear system whose natural dynamics is periodic . by synchronisation of outputs of both the systems ( by connecting them in feedback with a coupling gain ) and tuning the simpler system such that its dynamics is close to an upo of the chaotic system , the chaotic system can be stabilised to a periodic orbit .",
    "it is also observed that the above algorithm is more effective in controlling systems having homoclinic attractors , which points towards its similarity with non - linear pll s .",
    "the condition on the lti system for asymptotic synchronisation and stabilisation to upo , is under investigation and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "there is scope for future studies in using higher order filters and nonlinear systems in the feedback path .    in conclusion ,",
    "a method of stabilising chaotic systems approximately to a upo , by small continous time perturbations , is presented .",
    "the main advantage of the above method lies in its easy applicabilty to a wide variety of systems .",
    "no complex calculations are involved and the algorithm can be implemented using low order lti filters only .",
    "author would like to thank dr.m.vidyasagar , director , institute for robotics and intelligent systems , for his constant encouragement and help in the course of the above work ."
