    "formation of topological defects by the strongly - nonequilibrium symmetry - breaking phase transitions is the subject of interest both in condensed matter and field theory .",
    "this is because of a close similarity between the lagrangian of landau ",
    "ginzburg theory , widely used to describe phase transitions in the condensed - matter systems , and the lagrangians of the modern elementary - particle theories ( such as the standard electroweak model or various kinds of the grand unification theories ) , which are substantially based on the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "after the phase transitions in all the above - mentioned cases , the stable topological defects of the order parameter can arise , such as the monopoles , strings ( vortices ) , and domain walls , depending on the symmetry group involved .",
    "the most efficient mechanism of the defect formation is the so - called kibble ",
    "zurek scenario,@xcite which is based on the simple causality arguments .",
    "namely , if during the phase transition the information about the order parameter can spread over the distance @xmath2 , then the phases of the order parameter should be established independently in the regions of characteristic size @xmath2 .",
    ", appearing in the kibble  zurek scenario , should not be mixed with the coherence length commonly introduced in the landau ",
    "ginzburg theory for the systems in thermodynamic equilibrium or quasi - equilibrium . ] as a result , after some relaxation following the phase transition , the stable defects of the order parameter should be formed at the typical separation @xmath2 from each other .",
    "so , their concentration in a 3-dimensional system can be roughly estimated as @xmath3 where @xmath4  3 , 2 , and 1 for the monopoles , strings ( vortices ) , and domain walls , respectively ; while the effective correlation length @xmath2 depends on the particular system under consideration .",
    "for example , in the symmetry breaking of higgs fields by the cosmological phase transitions ( i.e.  a generation of mass of the elementary particles ) @xmath2 is commonly taken to be@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the speed of light , and @xmath7 is hubble constant at the instant of phase transition .    in the consideration of vortex generation by a superfluid phase transition in helium ,",
    "the corresponding quantity is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the speed of the second sound ( i.e. a characteristic speed of propagation of information about the phase of the order parameter ) , and @xmath10 is the so - called quench time ( i.e. a characteristic time of the phase transition ) , defined as @xmath11    the similar definitions of @xmath2 are used also for other systems ( superconductors , liquid crystals , etc . ) .",
    "although kibble  zurek scenario was proposed initially in the context of cosmological phase transitions in the field theories admitting the symmetry breaking ( in fact , the first idea of such kind was put forward by bogoliubov@xcite almost 40 years ago ) , much efforts have been undertaken in the last decade to verify this phenomenon by the laboratory experiments .",
    "these works were originated by chuang , _ _ et  al.__@xcite in 1991 , and about a dozen of such experiments were performed by now in various superfluid and superconducting systems .",
    "they are summarized in table  [ tab : sumexp ] .",
    "( this table does not show a number of experiments with liquid crystals , aimed at the detailed study of inner structure of the defects without measuring the rates of their formation . )",

    "@xcite on the other hand , _ the concentration of the defects in macroscopic systems of higher dimensionality , _",
    "e.g.  the two - dimensional superconductor films  @xcite and three - dimensional volume samples of @xmath12he ( refs .  ) , _ was found to be considerably less than the theoretical predictions . _    in principle , there may be various explanations of the above fact ( for example , different material parameters of the substances listed in table  [ tab : sumexp ] ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to propose another explanation , which is based on the universal geometric properties of the systems under consideration , namely , their size and dimensionality ( or quasi - dimensionality ) .",
    "to carry out all calculations in analytic form , let us consider the simplest @xmath0-model of real scalar field ( the order parameter ) , whose lagrangian @xmath14    \\ , - \\ : \\frac{\\lambda}{4 } \\",
    ",    { \\big [ \\ , { \\varphi}^2 \\ ! - \\left ( { \\mu}^2 / \\lambda \\right ) \\big]}^2 \\label{lagrangian}\\ ] ] admits the discrete ( @xmath15 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "two stable vacuum states of this field ( which , for the sake of convenience , will be marked by the oppositely directed arrows ) are @xmath16 the structure of a domain wall between them , located at @xmath17 , is described as @xmath18 \\ , ; \\ ] ] and the specific energy concentrated in this wall equals @xmath19    let a domain structure formed after a strongly - nonequilibrium phase transition in this model be approximated by a regular rectangular grid with a cell size about the effective correlation length @xmath20 , whose definition in the kibble  zurek scenario was already discussed above in sec .",
    "[ sec : contopdef ] .",
    "the particular value of @xmath20 is not of importance here , but we shall assume that it is sufficiently large in comparison with a characteristic thickness of the domain wall  @xmath21 . as a result , the final pattern of vacuum states  ( [ vacstate ] ) after the phase transition will look like a distribution of spins on the rectangular grid .",
    "the key assumption of the kibble  zurek mechanism is that the final symmetry - broken states of the field @xmath22 in two neighboring cells are completely independent of each other .",
    "then , the probability of formation of a domain wall between them is given evidently by the ratio of the number of statistical configurations involving the domain wall to the total number of configurations : @xmath23 and the resulting concentration of the defects ( domain walls ) will be @xmath24 where d is the effective dimensionality of the system .",
    "in fact , such approach is not sufficiently accurate , because a nonzero value of the order parameter formed after the phase transition represents a coherent state of bose condensate , in which the specific quantum correlations may occur even at the distances exceeding the effective correlation length @xmath20 derived from the `` classical '' arguments .",
    "this kind of correlations was clearly demonstrated by the mjjl experiment  @xcite .",
    "a thin quasi - one - dimensional winding strip was engraved at the boundary between two crystalline grains of yba@xmath25cu@xmath26o@xmath27 high - temperature superconductor film , thereby forming a loop of 214 superconductor segments separated by the grain - boundary josephson junctions .",
    "this system experienced multiple heating  cooling cycles in the temperature range 77  k to @xmath28100  k , which covers both the critical temperature of superconducting phase transition in the segments of the loop ( @xmath29  k ) and in the junctions between them ( @xmath30  k ) .",
    "there is evidently no order parameter in the entire loop as long as @xmath31 .",
    "next , when the temperature drops below  @xmath32 but remains above  @xmath33 ( i.e. @xmath34 ) , some value of the order parameter should be established in each segment , as is schematically shown by arrows in the right - hand part of fig .",
    "[ fig : mjjl ] .",
    "since these segments are separated by nonconducting josephson junctions , it seems to be reasonable to assume that the phase jumps between them are random ( i.e. uncorrelated to each other ) .",
    "finally , when the temperature drops below @xmath33 , the entire loop becomes superconducting and , due to the above - mentioned jumps , a phase integral along the loop , in general , should be nonzero . as a result , the electric current @xmath35 ,",
    "circulating along the loop , and the corresponding magnetic flux @xmath36 , penetrating the loop , will be spontaneously generated .",
    "so , if the phase jumps in the intermediate state @xmath34 were absolutely uncorrelated , then distribution of the spontaneously - trapped magnetic flux in the particular experimental setup  @xcite would be given by the normal ( gaussian ) law with a characteristic width @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is the magnetic - flux quantum ) .",
    "on the other hand , the actual experimental distribution was found to be over two times wider ; and this anomaly was satisfactorily interpreted by the authors of the experiment assuming that the phase jumps in the intermediate state were not random but correlated to each other so that the probability @xmath39 of the phase difference @xmath40 in the @xmath41th junction was @xmath42 \\ : , \\label{mjjlcorrel}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the energy concentrated in the josephson junction , and @xmath44 is the phase transition temperature , measured in energy units .",
    "the nature of the above - mentioned correlations between the phases of order parameter in the spatially - separated regions is not sufficiently understood yet",
    ". they may be one of manifestations of the specific quantum `` entanglement '' , revealed by now in various quantum systems .",
    "we are not going to discuss here this problem in more detail but assume that the correlations like  ( [ mjjlcorrel ] ) are typical for all bose condensates formed by the symmetry - breaking phase transitions .",
    "as will be seen from the subsequent analysis , such an assumption will enable us to interpret satisfactorily a wide range of experimental data on the efficiency of formation of topological defects .",
    "just this fact can be considered as indirect confirmation of universality of  ( [ mjjlcorrel ] ) .",
    "as follows from the above discussion , the probabilities of various field configurations after a symmetry - breaking phase transition should be calculated taking into account the energy concentrated in the defects . as a result",
    ", a pattern of the domains formed by the strongly - nonequilibrium phase transition in the @xmath45 lattice model will look like a distribution of spins in ising model at the temperature @xmath46 which is formally equivalent to the critical temperature @xmath47 of the initial @xmath45-model .",
    "all aspects of this formal correspondence are summarized in table  [ tab : formcor ] .",
    "as is known , all characteristics of the _ one - dimensional _ ising model can be calculated analytically ( for a detailed description of the method see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "the resulting formula for a defect concentration in a chain of length @xmath49 with periodic boundary conditions is @xmath50 which in the case of infinite chain is reduced to @xmath51    for the _ two - dimensional _ infinite lattice , statistical sum  ( [ gen_stat - sum ] ) can be reduced by the well - known technique to some integral over two variables , and the asymptotics of this integral can be obtained analytically just in the point of the phase transition of ising model ( for more details see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "unfortunately , these results are of little value for our work , since we need to know the statistical sum in a wide range of temperature . besides",
    ", this method can not be applied to the finite - size lattices , which are also of considerable interest for us .",
    "so , we used a more straightforward approach . in general , the statistical sum  ( [ gen_stat - sum ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the statistical weight of configurations involving @xmath54 elementary domain walls with energy @xmath55 each . in the particular case of two - dimensional @xmath56-cell ising model , the coefficients @xmath53",
    "were calculated by the methods of computer algebra both for the lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( in which every domain wall carries the energy @xmath55 ) and with the free boundaries ( where only the inner domain walls contribute to the total energy of the configuration ) .",
    "the corresponding coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 are listed in tables  [ tab : coef_per ] and  [ tab : coef_free ] .",
    "next , the concentration of domain walls is obtained by substituting  ( [ modif_stat - sum ] ) into  ( [ gen_def - con ] ) ; and the final result takes the form @xmath59 where in the case under consideration @xmath60 and @xmath61 ."
