    "this work fits in the line of research initiated in @xcite aiming to study the possible extensions of the work of bourgain on nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) posed on the flat torus to other compact manifolds .",
    "we are concerned here with the long time behavior of solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation , posed on the unit disc of @xmath0 .",
    "our aim is to construct the dynamics on a phase space of limited sobolev regularity and a wighted wiener measure invariant by the nls flow .",
    "consider the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a function defined on the unit disc @xmath3 the nonlinear interaction in ( [ 1 ] ) is induced by @xmath4 , @xmath5 which is a smooth ( non linear ) complex valued function .",
    "we also assume that @xmath6 and @xmath7 with a real valued @xmath8 satisfying the gauge invariance assumption @xmath9 in addition , we suppose that for some @xmath10 , @xmath11 the real number @xmath12 involved in ( [ rast ] ) corresponds to the `` degree '' of the nonlinear interaction .",
    "a typical example for @xmath13 is @xmath14 or @xmath15 when @xmath12 is an even integer . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the nonlinearity is sub - cubic which means that @xmath16 assumption ( [ subcubic ] ) on @xmath12 will be assumed from now on in the rest of this paper .",
    "notice that we do not suppose the defocusing assumption which in the context of ( [ 1 ] ) would be of type @xmath17 . in the ( easier ) defocusing case",
    ", one can expect to cover a larger set of possible values of @xmath12 ( see the final remarks at the end of the paper ) .",
    "+ it is important that the problem ( [ 1 ] ) may , at last formally , be seen as the hamiltonian pde @xmath18 in an infinite dimensional phase space , with hamiltonian @xmath19 and canonical coordinates @xmath20 .",
    "+ we are interested in the solutions of the initial boundary value problem associated to ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this means that we study ( [ 1 ] ) subject to an initial condition @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a given function . in this paper",
    ", we will only consider initial data of sobolev regularity @xmath23 and thus we will not need to specify the boundary conditions on @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the border of @xmath26 ( see also remark  [ granitza ] below ) .",
    "we will however use the dirichlet eigenfunctions of @xmath27 as basis of @xmath28 and this will be convenient for our well - posedness analysis of ( [ 1])-([2 ] ) . + we will only consider radial solutions of ( [ 1 ] ) , i.e. solutions depending only on @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we suppose that the data is radially symmetric , i.e. @xmath31 where @xmath32\\ , .\\ ] ] let @xmath33 be the bessel function of order zero ( see e.g. @xcite ) and let @xmath34 be the zeros of @xmath33 .",
    "we have that @xmath35 and the zeroes are simple .",
    "we also have that @xmath36 are eigenfunctions of the dirichlet self adjoint realization of @xmath37 , corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath38 .",
    "moreover any @xmath28 radial function can be expanded with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "let us set @xmath39 and @xmath40 we can decompose the solutions of ( [ 1 ] ) with data of type ( [ tilda ] ) as @xmath41 the initial data is thus given by @xmath42 i.e the initial data is uniquely determined from the sequence @xmath43 , @xmath44 . thus the equation ( [ 1 ] ) can be written as @xmath45 @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the projection on the mode @xmath48 .",
    "for instance if @xmath49 ( which will always be the case in this paper ) , we have @xmath50 of course one can define the action of @xmath47 on distributions but here we will not need it . notice that if @xmath51 , @xmath52 is simply the @xmath28 scalar product of @xmath53 and @xmath48 . formally ,",
    "equation ( [ 4 ] ) is in fact a hamiltonian equation with with canonical coordinates @xmath54 and hamiltonian @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath44 .",
    "more precisely equation ( [ 4 ] ) can be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the variational derivative and @xmath59 is the map inducing the symplectic form in the coordinates @xmath54 .",
    "the only important consequence , for our analysis , of this discussion is that @xmath60 is , at least formally , conserved by the flow of ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "+ let us now describe the construction of lebowitz - rose - speer ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of a weighted wiener measure which is at least formally invariant under under flow of ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the rigorous justification of the invariance of the measure will require , among other things , a new well - posedness result for the initial value problem ( [ 1])-([2 ] ) . let us fix a real number @xmath61 such that @xmath62 this number @xmath61 will be fixed from now on in all the rest the paper .",
    "notice that thanks to the restriction ( [ subcubic ] ) on the degree of the nonlinearity @xmath12 , @xmath63    for @xmath64 , let us denote by @xmath65 the sobolev space of radial functions on @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath66 if and only if @xmath67 with @xmath68 the sobolev space @xmath69 is naturally a complex hilbert space with orthonormal basis @xmath70 .",
    "denote by @xmath71 the scalar product in @xmath69 .",
    "our goal will be to construct a well defined ( at least local in time ) dynamics on @xmath69 and to construct a bounded borel measure on it , invariant by the flow of ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "+ the free hamiltonian is given by @xmath72 it turns out that a renormalization of the formal measure @xmath73 is a wiener measure .",
    "more precisely , we can give a sense of the formal measure @xmath74 as a measure on the hilbert space @xmath69 ( corresponding to a gaussian distribution for each mode ) .",
    "a set @xmath75 is called cylindrical if there exists @xmath76 and a borel set @xmath77 such that @xmath78 let us denote by @xmath79 the measure , defined on the cylindrical sets @xmath80 determined by ( [ cyl ] ) as @xmath81 the cylindrical sets form an algebra in @xmath69 .",
    "moreover the minimal sigma algebra containing all cylindrical sets is the borel sigma algebra . since ( see ( [ zeros ] ) below ) @xmath82",
    ", we deduce that the series @xmath83 converges .",
    "it implies that the linear map defined on @xmath69 by @xmath84 is in the trace class .",
    "therefore ( see e.g. @xcite ) the measure @xmath79 is countably additive on the cylindrical sets of @xmath69 .",
    "we then denote by @xmath85 the borel probability measure on @xmath69 which is the unique extension ( caratheodory theorem ) of @xmath79 to the borel sigma algebra of @xmath69 .",
    "for the sake of completeness , in section  3 we present the proof of the countable additivity @xmath79 on the algebra of the cylindrical sets of @xmath69 . as we will show in proposition",
    "[ high ] , for @xmath86 , @xmath87 and thus , we may consider @xmath85 as a measure on the space @xmath88 thus one should not take the particular choice of @xmath61 that we made too seriously .",
    "notice that since @xmath89 the boundary conditions are not of importance in the definition of @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , in ( [ x ] ) the intersection may be assumed countable .",
    "+ one may hope that the expression @xmath91 which is a normalised version of the formal gibbs measure @xmath92 is a well defined measure .",
    "the expression @xmath92 is formally invariant by the flow thanks to the hamiltonian conservation .",
    "if we were in finite dimensions the invariance would follow from the invariance of the lebesgue measure by the flow ( liouville s theorem ) .",
    "there is however a problem with the integrability of the above density with respect to @xmath85",
    ". we will solve this problem by using the @xmath93 cut - off idea of lebowitz - rose - speer @xcite .",
    "+ this paper is devoted to the proof of the following statement .",
    "[ glavna ] fix @xmath94 .",

    ", we define the functional @xmath98 by @xmath99 then for every @xmath100 , @xmath101 moreover , if we set @xmath102 then there exists a set @xmath103 of full @xmath104 measure such that for every @xmath105 the cauchy problem ( [ 1])-([2 ] ) has a unique ( in a suitable functional framework ) global in time solution .",
    "finally , if we denote by @xmath106 , @xmath107 the flow of ( [ 1 ] ) acting on @xmath103 then the measure @xmath104 is invariant under the flow of ( [ 1 ] ) , i.e. for every @xmath104 measurable set @xmath108 , every @xmath107 , @xmath109    the uniqueness statement of theorem  [ glavna ] can be precised as follows : for every @xmath110 there exists a banach space @xmath111 continuously embedded in @xmath112;h^s_{rad}(\\theta))$ ] such that the solution of ( [ 1 ] ) with data @xmath105 is unique in @xmath111 .",
    "notice that thanks to the growth assumption ( [ rast ] ) and the sobolev embedding , the functional @xmath98 is well - defined for @xmath97 .",
    "+ as a consequence of theorem  [ glavna ] , the poincar recurrence theorem implies that almost surely on the support of @xmath113 the solutions of ( [ 1 ] ) are stable according to poisson ( see @xcite and the references therein for more details ) . +",
    "similar results to theorem  [ glavna ] in the case of the circle @xmath114 are known thanks to the works @xcite .",
    "gibbs type invariant measures for a wicked ordered cubic defocusing nls , posed on the two dimensional rational torus are constructed in @xcite .",
    "+ invariant measures for defocusing nls of type ( [ 1 ] ) posed on an arbitrary compact riemannian manifold are constructed in @xcite .",
    "these measures are not of gibbs type ( but still related to the conservation laws ) , and are living on functions in the sobolev space @xmath115 .",
    "let us notice that dirac measures concentrated on a stationary ( independent of @xmath29 ) solutions of ( [ 1 ] ) are clearly invariant .",
    "the measures constructed in @xcite are not of this trivial type since the defocusing nature of the problem excludes the existence of stationary solutions .",
    "+ the proof of theorem  [ glavna ] follows the ideas developed by zhidkov ( see @xcite and the references by the same author therein ) and bourgain @xcite .",
    "the main difficulties we should overcome are to prove a new local well - posedness results for ( [ 1 ] ) , posed on the unit disc as well as adapting some estimates on random fourier series to the case of functions on the unit disc of @xmath0 . in the local well - posedness analysis , we need some bilinear strichartz estimates . starting from the work of bourgain ,",
    "estimates in this spirit were already used by many authors in the context of dispersive pde s . in the analysis here , the crucial bilinear effect results from simple properties of the bessel functions and estimates on some series of bessel functions .",
    "notice that the bilinear approach and the bourgain spaces are needed to be employed here since the well - posedness analysis of @xcite based only on linear strichartz inequalities and sobolev spaces requires the restriction @xmath116 ( thus missing @xmath90 ) coming from the sobolev embedding @xmath117 , @xmath116 in two dimensions .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to some properties of the bessel functions needed for our analysis of nls ( [ 1 ] ) . in section  3",
