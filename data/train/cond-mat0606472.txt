    "the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) , characterized by the absence of a magnetic field , is observed in some ferromagnetic crystals .",
    "while this has been well established experimentally , its explanation is still controversial .",
    "one , put forward by karplus and luttinger @xcite fifty years ago , suggests that the effect is due to an anomalous current .",
    "many years later , it has been argued @xcite that the semiclassical dynamics of a bloch electron in a crystal should involve a berry curvature term , @xmath0 . in the @xmath1 band",
    "the equations of motion read , in an electromagnetic field ,",
    "@xmath2 \\dot{\\bk}&=e{\\bf e}+e\\dot{{\\bf r}}\\times{\\bf b}({\\bf r } ) , \\label{lorentz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the electron s intracell position and quasimomentum , respectively ; @xmath5 is the band energy .",
    "the relation ( [ velrel ] ) exhibits an _ anomalous velocity term _ , @xmath6 , which is the mechanical counterpart of the anomalous current .",
    "the model is distinguished by the non - commutativity of the position coordinates  : in the absence of a magnetic field , @xmath7 @xcite . in the free noncommutative model in @xmath8 space dimensions",
    ", @xmath0 can only be momentum - dependent such that @xmath9 @xcite .    a remarkable discovery concerns the ahe in the metallic ferromagnet srruo@xmath10 .",
    "fang et al .",
    "@xcite found in fact that the experimental data are consistent with @xmath0 taking the form of a _ monopole in momentum space _ , @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "( [ kmonop ] ) is , furthermore , the only possibility consistent with rotational symmetry @xcite .",
    "here we propose to study the ahe in the semiclassical framework ( as advocated in @xcite ) , with non - commutative parameter ( [ kmonop ] ) . for @xmath13 and a constant electric field , @xmath14const . and assuming a parabolic profile @xmath15 , eqn .",
    "( [ lorentz ] ) , @xmath16 , is integrated as @xmath17 the velocity relation ( [ velrel ] ) becomes in turn @xmath18 where @xmath19 [ `` hats '' denote vectors normalized to unit length ] .",
    "the component of @xmath20 parallel to @xmath21 has no interest ; we can assume therefore that @xmath20 is perpendicular to the electric field .",
    "writing @xmath22 , eqn .",
    "( [ ahevelrel ] ) yields that the component parallel to @xmath20 moves uniformly , @xmath23 , and its component parallel to the electric field is uniformly accelerating , @xmath24 .",
    "( our choices correspond to chosing time so that the turning point is at @xmath25 . )",
    "however , owing to the anomalous term in ( [ velrel ] ) , the particle is also deviated perpendicularly to @xmath20 and @xmath21 , namely by @xmath26 it follows that the trajectory leaves its initial the plane and suffers , between @xmath27 to @xmath28 , a _",
    "finite _ _ transverse shift _ , namely @xmath29 most contribution to the shift comes when the momentum is small , i.e. , `` near the @xmath30-monopole . ''    @xmath31 becomes a half - integer upon quantization , @xmath32 , and hence ( [ shift ] ) is indeed @xmath33 .",
    "the constant @xmath34 , the minimal possible value of momentum , plays the role of an impact parameter . let us observe that while ( [ shift ] ) does not depend on the field @xmath21 or the electric charge @xmath35 , the limit @xmath36 is singular . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the motion is uniform along a straight line .",
    "the transverse shift is reminiscent of the recently discovered optical hall effect @xcite and can also be derived , just like in the optical case , using the angular momentum .",
    "the free expression @xcite , @xmath38 is plainly broken by the electric field to its component parallel to @xmath21 , @xmath39 whose conservation yields once again the shift ( [ shift ] ) .",
    "our model is plainly not realistic : what we described is , rather , the deviation of a freely falling non - commutative particle from the classical parabola found by galileo .",
    "particles in a metal are not free , though , and their uniform acceleration in the direction of @xmath21 should be damped by some mechanism .",
    "it is nevertheless remarkable that we obtain qualitative information from such a toy model .    .",

    "s. murakami for calling my attention to similar work in the context of the spin hall effect in semiconductors @xcite .",
