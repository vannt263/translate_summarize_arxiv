    "in the past two decades , chaotic systems have been extensively used to construct cryptosystems in either analog @xcite or digital @xcite forms .",
    "most analog implementations are secure communication systems based on synchronization of the sender and the receiver chaotic systems @xcite , where the signal is transmitted over a public channel from the sender to drive the receiver for achieving synchronization and message decryption .",
    "some different encryption structures have been proposed : chaotic masking @xcite , chaotic switching or chaotic shift keying ( csk ) @xcite , chaotic modulation @xcite , and the inverse system approach @xcite . at the same time , many different cryptanalysis methods have also been developed to break the proposed chaos - based secure communication systems : return - map attacks @xcite , nonlinear prediction based attacks @xcite , spectral analysis attacks @xcite , generalized synchronization ( gs ) based attacks @xcite , short - time period based attacks @xcite , parameter identification based attacks @xcite , and so on .    given the existence of so many different attacks , it has become a real challenge to design highly secure chaos - based communication systems against all known attacks .",
    "three general countermeasures have been proposed in the literature : 1 ) using more complex dynamical systems , such as high - dimensional hyperchaotic systems or multiple cascaded ( heterogeneous ) chaotic systems @xcite ; 2 ) introducing traditional ciphers into the chaotic cryptosystems @xcite ; 3 ) introducing an impulsive ( also named sporadic ) driving signal instead of a continuous signal to realize synchronization @xcite . the first countermeasure has been found insecure against some attacks @xcite , and some security defects of the second countermeasure have also been reported @xcite , but the last one has not yet been cryptanalyzed to date .",
    "besides the above three general countermeasures , there also exist some specially - designed countermeasures that can be used to resist certain attacks .",
    "this paper studies two such countermeasures , recently proposed by @xcite , against return - map attacks .",
    "these two proposed countermeasures are multistep parameter modulation and alternative driving of transmitter variables , which have been combined to construct a new secure communication scheme for binary signal transmissions . after refining return - map attacks via a deterministic relationship between the return map and a parameter @xmath0",
    ", we found that the security of the first countermeasure was much over - estimated in @xcite , and that the combination of the two countermeasures can be easily separated in some way so as to disable the second countermeasure .",
    "the aforementioned deterministic relationship between the return map and the parameter @xmath0 is reported in this paper , for the first time in the literature , which is useful not only for engineering studies on chaos - based secure communications but also for theoretical studies on the dynamics of chaotic systems .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , a brief introduction to return - map attacks and related countermeasures",
    "section [ section : breakingmspm ] re - evaluates the security of the multistep parameter modulation scheme , by exploiting a deterministic relationship between the shape of the return map and the modulated parameter @xmath0 . the original return - map attack proposed by @xcite",
    "will be enhanced . in sec .",
    "[ section : breakingadtv ] , cryptanalysis of the scheme of alternative driving of transmitter variables is studied in detail .",
    "the last section concludes the paper .",
    "the return - map attack method was first proposed by @xcite to break chaotic switching ( binary parameter modulation ) and chaotic masking schemes based on the lorenz system , which was then studied by @xcite to break chaotic masking , switching and non - autonomous modulation schemes based on chua s circuit . in @xcite , the return - map attack method was also used to break a dcsk scheme based on a discrete - time chaotic map @xcite . without loss of generality , this paper will focus on the attack scheme of @xcite on the lorenz system thereby demonstrating how the return map is constructed and how the attack works to break a typical chaotic switching scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "consider the following lorenz system used as the sender : @xmath1 where @xmath2 are system parameters , and the value of @xmath0 is modulated by @xmath3 , the digital plain - signal for secure transmission , as follows : @xmath4 to transmit @xmath3 to the receiver end , a variable of the sender system , such as @xmath5 , is sent out , which will be used to induce synchronization of the receiver system , resulting in : @xmath6 where @xmath7 . when @xmath8 , the intended synchronization can be reached , while when @xmath9 , the synchronization error always remains at a certain finite order .",
    "then , it is easy to decode the secret signal @xmath3 by checking the power energy @xmath10 with a digital filter . following @xcite ,",
    "the parameters are set as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "however , the above chaotic switching scheme can be easily broken with the return map constructed from @xmath5 as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "assuming that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the @xmath17-th maxima and @xmath17-th minima of @xmath5 , respectively , define the following four variables : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and then construct two return maps , ( @xmath22 vs @xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24 vs @xmath25 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : rm_csk ] .",
    "the two maps are actually equivalent to each other , so we only consider the map ( @xmath22 vs @xmath23 ) in this paper .",
    "note that there are three segments in the return map , and each segment is further split into two strips .",
    "it is obvious that the split of the map is caused by the switching of the value of @xmath0 between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus , by checking which strip the point @xmath28 falls on , one can easily unmask the current value of the digital signal @xmath3 . since one has to assign either 0-bit or 1-bit to a strip in each segment , it was claimed in @xcite that there are only seven chances to make wrong assignments , which can be easily detected by observing the waveform of the reconstructed digital signal @xmath3 .        in recent years",
    ", some different countermeasures have been proposed to resist the above return - map attack . in @xcite ,",
    "a periodic signal @xmath29 is combined with @xmath30 to modulate the transmitted signal @xmath5 so as to blur the reconstructed return map in order to frustrate the attacker .",
    "however , soon it was broken as reported in @xcite via distinguishing the parameters @xmath31 and removing the modulating signal .",
    "a modified scheme of the original method of @xcite was proposed in @xcite to further improve its security .",
    "our recent work shows that this modified modulating scheme is still not secure enough @xcite and that the modulating signal can still be effectively removed via parameters estimation .    in @xcite ,",
    "two new countermeasures were proposed and combined to enhance the security of chaotic switching schemes against return - map attacks .",
    "the first countermeasure is to increase the number of strips by modulating @xmath0 between @xmath32 different values : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath33 correspond to @xmath8 and @xmath34 correspond to @xmath9 .",
    "this countermeasure is called _ multistep parameter modulation _ , and accordingly the original two - valued chaotic switching scheme is called _ single - step parameter modulation_. it was claimed that the chances to make wrong assignments become @xmath35 and that the security against return - map attacks is dramatically enhanced even when @xmath36 is not too large .",
    "figure [ figure : rm_mspm ] shows the return map constructed from @xmath5 when the multistep parameter modulation is used , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "it can be seen that each segment is split into @xmath40 strips .",
    "the second countermeasure is to alternatively use @xmath5 and @xmath41 as the driving signal to force the receiver system to synchronize with the sender , which will further split the constructed return map into two parts : one corresponds to the map from @xmath5 and another to the map from @xmath41 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : rm_mspmad ] , there exist some small fluctuations in @xmath41 .",
    "the faked maxima and minima induced by the small fluctuations should be removed from the return map ; otherwise , the map will become completely meaningless .",
    "for the return map plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure : rm_mspmad ] , therefore , if the difference between two consecutive maxima and minima is less than 1 , they will be omitted . ] .",
    "it can be seen that two segments of the @xmath5-map and the @xmath41-map largely overlap each other . in a multistep parameter modulation system",
    ", the receiver contains @xmath32 different driven sub - systems , which are used to realize synchronization for the @xmath32 different values of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "when alternative driving is also applied , the number of sub - systems is doubled to be @xmath42 , among which @xmath32 correspond to @xmath5-driving synchronization and another @xmath32 to @xmath41-driving synchronization . for more details about the two countermeasures ,",
    "see @xcite .",

    "the security of multistep parameter modulation relies on the fact that the attacker has to assign 0-bits or 1-bits for all strips in the return map .",
    "since there are @xmath43 stripes in total , the success probability to make a right assignment is @xmath44 , i.e. , the attack complexity is @xmath45 .",
    "note that the above analysis on the security is more rigorous , from the cryptographical point of view , than the one given in @xcite , where the latter enumerated the number of making wrong assignments under the assumption that the first assignment is correct . of course , the order of the estimated attack complexity is the same .",
    "the above security estimation is based on the assumption that all @xmath43 strips are independent of each other .",
    "however , we found that this assumption is not true and that there exists a deterministic relationship between the positions of the strips and the @xmath32 different values of the modulated parameter @xmath0 , and this relationship will dramatically reduce the attack complexity in all attacking scenarios . in fig .",
    "[ figure : rm_bs]a , the two return maps corresponding to @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively are plotted to show such a deterministic relationship . one can see that the three segments corresponding to @xmath46 are closer to the origin , while the three segments corresponding to @xmath47 are farther .",
    "this means that there exist only two possibilities to assign the 0/1-bits to all strips in the chaotic switching scheme ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : rm_csk ] ) : for all three segments , assign 0-bit ( or 1-bit ) to the strip closer to the origin and 1-bit ( or 0-bit ) to the other one . if the relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath27 is also known to the attacker , he can uniquely determine the right assignment to completely break the plain - signal . apparently , the above analysis can be easily generalized to multistep parameter modulation .",
    "figure [ figure : rm_bs]b shows the return maps corresponding to the 10 different values of @xmath0 used in @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that fig .",
    "[ figure : rm_bs]b is almost identical with the return map shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : rm_mspm]a .",
    "thus , it is easy to mark each strip of the return map shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : rm_mspm]a with one of the @xmath40 possible values of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for segment 1 shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : rm_mspm]b , the @xmath48-th strip corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "this means that the task of assigning 0/1-bits to @xmath43 strips is changed to another equivalent task of assigning 0/1-bits to @xmath32 different values of @xmath0 .",
    "considering that there are @xmath36 values corresponding to 0-bits and other @xmath36 values to 1-bits , one can easily deduce that the number of all possible bit assignments is @xmath50 , which is @xmath51 when @xmath52 following stirling s approximation @xcite .",
    "as a conclusion , the attack complexity is always much smaller than @xmath53 , the original complexity estimated in @xcite .",
    "table [ table : complexity ] shows a comparison of the two complexities . from the cryptographical point of view ,",
    "based on today s computer technology , a practically secure cryptosystem should have a complexity of order @xmath54 @xcite , which requires @xmath55 following the data shown in table [ table : complexity ] .",
    "however , in this case , @xmath56 sub - systems have to be constructed to realize the decryption of the transmitted digital signal @xmath3 , which makes the implementation too costly for most practical applications . if the security can be relaxed to order of @xmath57 , @xmath58 sub - systems are enough to be practical in some applications ( though still much more costly than other chaos - based secure communication systems ) .",
    "note that the implementation cost will be acceptable in practice , if all the sub - systems can be realized with the same chaotic circuit .",

    "for instance , for the example given in @xcite , 1-bits are assigned to @xmath87 and 0-bits to @xmath88 , so one can get about 80% of right bits with the following bit assignment : 1-bits are assigned to @xmath89 , and 0-bits to @xmath90 , where the bold values correspond to wrong bits . generally speaking , if there are @xmath91 values corresponding to wrong bits , the bit error ratio ( ber ) at the attacker end will be @xmath92 , i.e. , the probability to get right bits is @xmath93 .",
    "note that when @xmath94 , the attacker can simply flip all assigned bits to get a lower ber @xmath95 .",
    "from such a point of view , the worst bit assignment occurs when @xmath96 or @xmath97 . considering that the bit assignment can be regarded as an equivalent of the secret key , the above fact means that the decryption of multistep parameter modulation is insensitive to the mismatch of the secret key .",
    "however , such an insensitivity does not reduce the attack complexity by too much , since the number of wrong assignments corresponding to @xmath98 or @xmath97 is in the same order as the complexity @xmath51 when @xmath99 : the number is @xmath100 , which is not much smaller than @xmath51 .    in cryptography , there are many different attacking scenarios @xcite .",
    "a cryptographically secure cryptosystem should be immune to all kinds of attacks .",
    "the above attack complexity of multistep parameter modulation is for the simplest attack ",
    "the ciphertext - only attack , where the attacker can only observe some ciphertexts .",
    "when some other attacking scenarios are available , the security of multistep parameter modulation will be dramatically downgraded .",
    "now , let us consider the security against known - plaintext and chosen - plaintext attacks , where the attacker can get or choose some plaintexts to carry out the attacks .",
    "such attacks are feasible in some real applications and become more and more common in the digital networked world today . in known / chosen - plaintext attacks , it is obvious that the knowledge about some plaintexts means the knowledge about the bit assignment of the @xmath43 strips : when @xmath8 ( or 1 ) , one immediately knows that the strip on which a point @xmath28 lies corresponds to a 0-bit ( or 1-bit ) , and then knows that other two strips marked with the same value of @xmath0 also correspond to 0-bits ( or 1-bits ) .",
    "that is , he can assign a 0-bit ( or 1-bit ) to the value of @xmath0 corresponding to the distinguished strip . once @xmath36 0-bits ( or 1-bits )",
    "have been assigned to @xmath36 different values of @xmath0 , the attacker can directly assign 1-bits ( or 0-bits ) to all other undetermined values so as to complete the attack . for the number of",
    "required known / chosen plain - bits in the above attack , we have the following theoretical result .",
    "assume that @xmath0 distributes uniformly over the set of @xmath32 values and that any two values of @xmath0 are independent of each other .",
    "then , the average number of required known / chosen plain - bits in the above known / chosen - plaintext attack is @xmath101 .",
    "denote the @xmath102 known / chosen plain - bits by @xmath103 , and the corresponding values of @xmath0 by @xmath104 .",
    "the condition that the attack is completed for the @xmath105 known / chosen plain - bits equals to the following term : @xmath106 values corresponding to 0-bits ( or 1-bits ) have occurred in @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is the first occurrence of the last value . considering that each value occurs with a uniform probability @xmath109 and any two values are independent of each other , it is easy to get the probability that the attack stops with @xmath105 known / chosen plain - bits , @xmath110 , as follows : @xmath111 substituting @xmath112 into the above equation , one can get @xmath113 . it is obvious that @xmath114 obeys a geometric distribution , and one can immediately deduce that @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath116 .",
    "the proof is thus completed .    since @xmath36",
    "can not be too large to make the cryptosystem practical in real applications , the above theorem shows that multistep parameter modulation is not sufficiently secure against known / chosen - plaintext attacks . in fig .",
    "[ figure : rm_attack_mspm ] , we give an example of known / chosen - plaintext attacks .",

    "in this section , we consider how to break another countermeasure ",
    "alternative driving of transmitter variables .",
    "following the example given in @xcite , we focus on the @xmath124/@xmath125-driving of the lorenz system .",
    "although the alternative driving can make the return map less clearer by introducing overlaps of the @xmath5-map and the @xmath41-map , it is found that the two overlapped sub - maps can be easily separated so that an attack can be carried out on the two sub - maps separately .",
    "since there are only two possible driving signals , the separation of the two driving signals can be simplified to the problem of detecting the times at which the driving signal , denoted by @xmath126 here , changes from @xmath5 to @xmath41 or from @xmath41 to @xmath5 .",
    "this can be easily done by observing the differentiations of @xmath126 , since the alternative driving will introduce breaking points at each switching time ( i.e. , discontinuities in @xmath126 ) . considering that chaotic signals @xmath117 and @xmath127 are both continuous",
    ", the switching times can be easily distinguished from sudden and large differentiations of @xmath126 , where the word  sudden \" means that the differentiation at a time @xmath128 is much larger than the others around it . in fig .",
    "[ figure : differences_ds ] , the first - order , second - order , 4th - order and 8th - order discrete - time differentiations of @xmath126 are shown for demonstration , where the display range on the @xmath125-axis is always limited within @xmath129 $ ] to emphasize some sudden and large changes of differentiations with relatively small amplitudes .",
    "it can be seen that all switching times are sufficiently prominent in the 8th - order differentiations .",
    "once the switching times are detected , one can easily separate the @xmath5-map and the @xmath41-map to break the multistep parameter modulation as discussed in the last section .    , where @xmath130.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in fact , it is even possible to directly separate the two sub - maps without calculating differentiations of @xmath126 . observing fig .",
