    "studies of the two types of blazars , bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , have shown that their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are characterized by a double peaked luminosity structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the bl lacs and frsqs classes are defined according to the absence or presence of strong broad emission lines in their optical / uv spectrum , respectively .",
    "the shapes of these bumps are characterized in the log(@xmath2 ) vs.  log @xmath3 plot by a smooth spectrum extending through several frequency decades .",
    "the low - energy peak is well explained by synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in a jet closely aligned to the line of sight , with bulk lorentz factor , @xmath4 of order of 10100 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , the position of the low - energy peak leads to a further classification of the blazars into three categories , depending on the peak frequency of their synchrotron bump , @xmath5 : low - synchrotron - peaked ( lsp ) sources with @xmath5 @xmath6 10@xmath7 hz ; intermediate - synchrotron - peaked ( isp ) the sources , those with 10@xmath7 hz @xmath6 @xmath5 @xmath6 10@xmath8 hz ; and high - synchrotron - peaked ( hsp ) sources , with @xmath5 @xmath9 10@xmath8 hz .",
    "this scheme is an extension of the classification introduced by @xcite for bl lacs ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the high energy ( hard x - ray and @xmath10-ray component of the sed is usually explained as arising from inverse compton scattering of the same electrons producing the synchrotron emission .",
    "these electrons interact either with the synchrotron photons themselves ( synchrotron self - compton , ssc ; e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or with external photons originating in the local environment ( external compton , ec ) . in the latter case",
    "soft photons can be produced directly by the accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or indirectly , for instance those reprocessed by the broad line region ( blr ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by the dust torus @xcite .",
    "alternative hadronic models , where the @xmath10-rays are produced by high - energy protons , either via proton synchrotron radiation or via secondary emission from photo - pion and photo - pair - production reactions , have also been proposed ( see * ? ? ? * and the references therein for a review ) .",
    "the shape of these bumps is characterised in the log(@xmath2 ) vs. log @xmath3 plot by a smooth spectrum extending through several frequency decades .",
    "below and above the peaks the spectrum can be approximated with simple power law profiles with spectral indices above and below the peaks @xcite , and such power law spectra are naturally produced if the the emitting electrons follow a power law distribution of energy .",
    "so , the broad band sed of blazars can be well approximated by a simple parabolic function with logarithms of its variables ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the log - parabolic function is one of the simplest ways to represent curved spectra and under simple approximations , can be obtained via a statistical electron acceleration mechanism where the acceleration probability decreases with the particle energy @xcite .    the emission from blazars is known to be variable at all wavelengths .",
    "the flux variability is often accompanied by spectral changes .",
    "these sed changes are very likely associated with changes in the spectra of emitting electrons that arise from differences in the physical parameters of the jet .",
    "hence modelling of blazar broadband spectra is required to understand the extreme conditions within the emission region .",
    "not only is the broadband sed crucial to this understanding , but variability information is also needed to allow us to describe how high emission states arise and how they differ from the low states .",
    "this type of study is most important in discriminating between models .",
    "since it is reasonably to assume that only a few parameters of the model will change significantly between different states of the same source , such comparative modelling of broadband spectra allows us to put rather tight constraints on those model parameters that are likely to change , at least under the assumption that all other parameters are held fixed for the different model fits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we focus on the study of changes in the seds of bl lacs and fsrqs corresponding to observed changes in their respective optical fluxes .",
    "the sed variations are expected to be produced by changes in the spectra of the emitting electrons which in turn arise from variations in the physical parameters of the emission region .",
    "therefore we needed to first construct models and then investigate how the seds observed in different states might be explained through changes in these parameters .",
    "more explicitly , we modelled the observed spectra of blazars from radio to optical frequencies using a synchrotron model with the emitting electrons following a log - parabolic distribution of energy .",
    "this allows us to try to estimate the factors responsible for short term optical flares or short - term variability ( stv ) in blazars . in this paper",
    ", we will strictly concentrate on the low energy hump ( synchrotron emission ) portion of blazar seds .",
    "a complete investigation of the entire broad band seds of these objects , including x - ray and @xmath10-ray data , will be performed in the future .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 provides a brief description of the multi - frequency data we employed . in section 3 , we discuss the sed modelling and section 4 provides our results . our discussion is given in section 5 and we present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the multi - frequency sed data of our 10 blazars span a frequency range between radio and optical , including mm , sub - mm and infra - red ( ir ) data .",
    "these measurements were all taken between 2008 september and 2009 june .",
    "our sample consists of five bl lacs and five fsrqs , eight of which are lsps and two of which are isps .",
    "we selected these sources as they were bright enough for us to obtain day to day flux coverage in b , v , r , and i passbands .",
    "certainly this number of objects is too small to provide clearly representative samples of the bl lac and fsrq classes and there may be unknown biases in our two groups . despite the small sample sizes , some general behaviours",
    "might be noted in these data and then investigated in more detail in the future with larger samples . the short term variability ( stv ) in flux as well as in colour of these blazars",
    "was recently reported by @xcite .",
    "we used this optical data in our sed study and added to them data collected at other frequencies over the same time period .",
    "radio flux densities at 4.5 ghz , 8 ghz and 14.5 ghz frequencies are obtained from university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) data base .",
    "the mm and sub - mm data are provided by the submillimeter array ( sma ) observer center data base .",
    "the near - ir data are collected from the monitoring provided by the small and moderate aperture research telescope system ( smarts ) .    for investigating the impact of the variations in flux on the source parameters used for modelling the seds we always ascertained two seds of the same source that are characterized by a change of at least 0.3 magnitudes in the optical r - band .",
    "the brighter one is denoted as the high - state and the fainter as the low - state .",
    "the time periods during which the different seds of all the sources were obtained are listed in the first column of table 1 immediately below the name of each of the blazars .",
    "details of their optical properties can be found in @xcite .",
    "we note that while we tried to obtain and utilize data taken simultaneously , this was rarely possible , and the temporal intervals over which the data needed to produce an sed in a low or high state could be found range from three days through three months .",
    "clearly , this lack of simultaneity can lead to substantial uncertainties in the analysis .",
    "we performed the spectral analysis using a homogeneous synchrotron emission model with log parabola ( lp ) energy distribution of emitting electrons to fit the lower energy part of observed spectra , i.e. , synchrotron spectra .",
    "the best fit model to each blazar in each of two states was obtained by a numerical ssc code @xcite .",
    "we used an sed code available on - line .",
    "the simplified model assumes that radiation is produced within a single blob in the jet , which is taken to be moving relativistically at small angle along the line of sight of the observer . thus the observed radiation has a doppler boosting factor @xmath11 = [ @xmath12^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath13 is the velocity of the source divided by the velocity of light , @xmath4 is the lorentz factor , and @xmath14 is the angle between the line of sight of observer and direction of motion of the source .",
    "the observed sed of blazars has a double peaked structure and a simple analytical function that can model the shape of these broad peaks is a parabola in the logarithms of the variables , i.e. , a log parabola ( lp ) .",
    "this function has three spectral parameters and can be defined as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath0 is the photon index at an arbitrary energy ( usually taken to be 1 kev ) and @xmath1 is the measure of spectral curvature of the observed radiation .",
    "one advantage of the lp functional form compared to other option is that in lp formulation the curvature around the peak is characterized by a single parameter @xmath1 , while in other models it is characterized by more complex functions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , the limitation is that it is more suited for distributions symmetrically decreasing with respect to peak frequency , than is the norm for synchrotron spectra .",
    "although more complex models , such as a power - law plus log - parabola model , should fit the mm and longer wavelengths data better , we do not have good coverage in those bands ; further , the simpler log - parabola model has a clear physical motivation , which we now discuss .",
    "@xcite showed that the log - parabolic spectrum is analytically related to the statistical acceleration mechanism .",
    "it is obtained when the acceleration probability , @xmath16 , depends upon energy itself , i.e. , @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are positive constants .",
    "such a situation can naturally occur when particles are confined by a magnetic field that has a confinement efficiency that decreases with an increase in the gyration radii of the accelerating particles @xcite .",
    "the integrated energy distribution of such accelerated particles is given by @xmath20},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the minimum lorentz factor in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the spectral parameters of the electron population and are related to those of the emitted radiation as @xcite @xmath24    with these approximations , we can completely specify the ssc model with the following parameters : magnetic field intensity ( @xmath25 ) , size of emission region ( @xmath26 ) , doppler boosting factor ( @xmath11 ) , the log - parabola spectral indices ( @xmath23 and @xmath22 ) , the number density of emitting electrons ( n ) , the redshift of the source , @xmath27 , and particle lorentz factors , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath21 . while fitting the sed of blazars using these parameters , we know the value of @xmath27 and we hold @xmath26 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 fixed .",
    "it is clear that there is a cut - off in the low energy part of synchrotron spectra at a frequency around 10@xmath30 hz due to synchrotron self - absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , so we consider this self - absorption in modelling the sed of blazars . because we are looking at short term variability over the course of a just a few months at most , we feel it justified to assume that @xmath26 is essentially constant for each source and we find that the values of @xmath28 , and @xmath29 we used for every case give good ranges for the electron energies needed to fit any of the seds and so they are fixed as well .",
    "the values of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath21 are rather tightly constrained to fit the observed slopes and we then made over than 30 different models for each source to produce the values of all the parameters that yield a `` best fit '' .",
    "a direct observation of the synchrotron peak will give a significant help to constrain the model parameters , but unfortunately , observations of blazars in infrared bands , above all , in the medium and far infrared , are not so common as are the radio , optical and near ir ones .",
    "occasionally this gap can be covered by space - based telescopes such as herschel @xcite .",
    "in addition , for fsrqs the seds are sometimes overwhelmed by thermal emission from an accretion disk , particularly during low - states @xcite , but our code is not able to consider this contribution while modelling the seds of blazars .",
    "this additional contribution may explain the excess of optical / uv emission with respect to the best - fit model for some fsrqs .",
    "the values of all these parameters that provide good fits for the two different seds of all of the eight lsps and two isps in our sample are listed in table 1 .",

    "so , the log - parabolic spectra are naturally produced when the probability of statistical acceleration is energy dependent . according to this model , the curvature of emitting electron population ( @xmath22 ) is related to fractional acceleration gain ( @xmath43 ) as r @xmath44 1/@xmath43 . also , e@xmath45",

    "so our result confirms that the spectral curvature parameter decreases as e@xmath45 moves towards higher energies and means that the blazars spectra in our cases are fit well by the log - parabolic model .    on the other hand ,",
    "such a connection of log - parabolic spectra with acceleration may be also understood in the framework provided by the fokker - planck equation with momentum diffusion term @xcite .",
    "they showed that the log - parabolic spectrum results from a fokker - planck equation with a momentum diffusion term and a mono - energetic or quasi - monoenergetic injection where the diffusion term acts to broaden the shape of the peak of the distribution .",
    "@xcite showed that the curvature term , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the diffusion term .",
    "this relation leads to the following trend @xcite : @xmath52 so the both the momentum - diffusion term , @xmath51 , and the fractional acceleration gain term , @xmath43 , can explain the anti - correlation between @xmath53 and @xmath1 .",
    "an interesting check if the log - parabolic curve is actually related to the statistical acceleration is the existence of a linear relation between the two spectral parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "so we checked the correlation among these two quantities and found that they are significantly correlated , with @xmath54 and @xmath16-value = 0.003 ( see fig .",
    "so , we consider that in our case the log - parabola type spectra are very likely to be characterized by a full statistical acceleration mechanism working on the emitting electrons .",
    "there are several possibilities that could be invoked to explain the changes in the synchrotron spectra . in the following sub - sections",
    ", we will discuss some of them in detail .",
    "+      the energy loss of the emitting particles is known to follow @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath31c@xmath57 where @xmath10 is the lorentz factor and @xmath58 is a constant for both the synchrotron and ic emission @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the relativistic particles can be described by energy - dependent fokker - planck equation ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath59    where n(@xmath10,t ) is the electron density distribution ( a function of energy and time ) and q(@xmath10,t ) is the time - dependent injection rate .",
    "the solutions to the equation above are typically rather complex and can be obtained in terms of green s functions for the general case .",
    "if the changes in the blazar seds are due to a gradual change of the electron energy density distribution due to the synchrotron and ic losses , with no other injections meanwhile , then one should see both a total synchrotron energy decrease and mostly a decrease in @xmath60 of the electron energy distribution ( and respectively @xmath31 the frequency of the synchrotron peak emission ) . on the other hand ,",
    "freshly injected electrons between the observational epochs ( their energy should be higher than the average as it is expected to decrease in time ) should reflect in the opposite behaviour ( higher synchrotron emission and a peak blue - shift ) .",
    "so , in general one should expect to see a relation between the peak intensity and the peak frequency changes . to search for such a relation we used correlation analysis statistics ( see fig .",
    "the correlation statistics revealed that there is no significant correlation between the two quantities as @xmath61 corresponding to a @xmath16-value = 0.084 , where @xmath62 is the linear pearson correlation coefficient and @xmath16 is a null hypothesis probability value . as there is no significant relation found between the two quantities ,",
    "perhaps electron energy density evolution / electron injection is not the primary driver of the sed changes .",
    "another effect that can modify the blazar synchrotron emission is the change of the doppler boosting factor , presumably due to a change either the bulk velocity or the viewing angle .",
    "@xcite also found that only geometrical ( doppler factor ) changes are capable of explaining sed variations between two epochs for bl lac .",
    "the changes of the synchrotron peak intensity vs.  doppler factor variations for our sample of blazars are shown in fig .",
    "we can see a clear relation among the two quantities and it is confirmed by values of @xmath63 and @xmath16-value = 0.05 .",
    "we also searched for a correlation between change in r band magnitude vs.  change in respective doppler factor values .",
    "this would be relevant if @xmath6r@xmath9 is a somewhat more representative quantity for the synchrotron emission rather than peak intensity .",

    "so we consider that doppler factor changes are a strong driver that can be responsible for the sed changes .      since the value of the magnetic field",
    ", @xmath25 is related to the location of the dissipation region , if the two seds arise from periods of different activity it is quite possible that the emission was produced by blob that dissipates at different location in the jet . in that case",
    "we expect to find different @xmath25 values for the different seds of our sources .",
    "the change in @xmath25 values can also lead to variations in the flux of these sources which will be reflected in the two different seds of the sources .",
    "so we search for a correlation between the change in @xmath6r@xmath9 and that in @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "9 ) but we do not find any significant correlation among them for all of out blazars .",
    "however , we notice an apparent significant correlation among these two parameters for the bl lacs alone , which is confirmed by correlation analysis ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 for bl lacs ) .",
    "so we conclude that changes in magnetic field strength may be responsible for the sed changes in the case of bl lacs .",
    "we have carried out the radio to optical through mm , sub - mm and ir sed studies of a sample of ten blazars including five bl lacs and five fsrqs , eight of which are lsps and the other two isps .",
    "we modelled the seds of blazars using synchrotron spectra with log - parabolic distributions .",
    "we found a significant negative correlation among @xmath36 and the curvature term @xmath22 , which implies that the acceleration efficiency of emitting electrons is inversely proportional to energy itself ; however this correlation can also be explained by the momentum diffusion term in the solution of fokker - planck equation .",
    "also , a significant correlation between the two spectral parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , implies that the log - parabolic curve is likely to be related to the statistical acceleration of emitting electrons .",
    "of course our modelling has significant limitations .",
    "we are assuming that only one - zone dominates the emission at any given time , and this is unlikely to be an excellent approximation .",
    "although we strived for data obtained simultaneously , this was often impossible to obtain ; therefore any variations within the  high \" and  low \" states have been averaged over time bins ranging from days to two months .",
    "this lack of simultaneity could have vitiated our results but only appears to have added scatter to all of the figures 49 .",
    "we considered each likely factor that could be responsible for the changes in observed seds of blazars .",
    "if the electron energy density evolution governs the sed changes then one should expect a correlation between change in peak intensity vs change in peak frequency . since we do not observe any such correlation we consider that probably the evolution of electron energy density can not be responsible for the observed sed changes . also for our entire sample of blazars , changes in @xmath6r@xmath68@xmath9",
    "are not correlated with the respective changes in @xmath25 , so the change in magnetic field strength is probably not responsible for the sed changes we saw .",
    "however , for the bl lacs alone the sed changes may be driven by changes in @xmath25 .",
    "we find that the change in doppler factor is significantly correlated with the change in peak intensity as well as with @xmath6r@xmath68@xmath9 .",
    "so it is reasonable to suggest that the change in doppler factor ( either bulk velocity or viewing angle ) is the primary driver that governs the sed changes in short term variability ( stv ) in blazars .",
