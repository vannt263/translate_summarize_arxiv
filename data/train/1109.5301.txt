    "the camassa - holm ( ch ) equation @xmath0 was first found by fokas and fuchssteiner @xcite with the method of recursion operators and shown to be a bi - hamiltonian equation with an infinite number of conserved functionals .",
    "camassa and holm @xcite showed that it appeared as a model for unidirectional propagation of waves in shallow water , @xmath1 representing the height of the free surface about a flat bottom , @xmath2 being a constant related to the critical shallow water speed . in this context , only real - valued solutions are physically meaningful .    to be able to formulate a cauchy problem for the ch equation which implies the solution of ( [ ch intro ] ) for a given function @xmath3 , it is convenient to write ( [ ch intro ] ) in the non - local evolutionary form , @xmath4 where the operator @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 , and where its inverse is defined by giving certain boundary conditions . since the inverse of the operator @xmath5 stands for an integral over the green s function for given boundary conditions , and thus an integral from some base point @xmath7 to @xmath8 , it is not a local operation in @xmath8 .",
    "this non - locality has mathematically interesting consequences : the ch equation has traveling wave solutions of the form @xmath9 ( @xmath10 being the speed , @xmath11 ) called peakons that have a discontinuous first derivative at the wave peak .",
    "camassa and holm @xcite described the dynamics of the peakons in terms of a finite - dimensional completely integrable hamiltonian system , namely , each peakon solution is associated with a mechanical system of moving particles .",
    "the class of mechanical systems of this type was further extended by calogero and franoise in @xcite .",
    "multi - peakon solutions were studied using different approaches in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "periodic solutions of the shallow water equation were discussed in @xcite .",
    "a further consequence of this non - locality is that solutions of the ch equation in terms of multi - dimensional theta functions do not depend explicitly on the physical coordinates .",
    "such solutions were first given by alber and fedorov in @xcite by solving a generalized jacobi inversion problem .",
    "in contrast to the well known cases of korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) , nonlinear schrdinger and sine - gordon equations , see for instance @xcite and references therein , complex solutions of the ch equation are not meromorphic functions of @xmath12 but have several branches . this is due to the presence of an implicit function @xmath13 of the variables @xmath8 and @xmath14 in the argument of the theta function appearing in the solutions .",
    "a monodromy effect is thus present in the profile of real - valued solutions such as cusps and peakons .",
    "this means that even bounded solutions to the ch equation can have discontinuous or infinite derivatives in contrast to kdv solutions .",
    "algebro - geometric solutions of the camassa - holm equation and their properties are studied in @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to give an independent derivation of such solutions based on identities between multi - dimensional theta functions , which naturally arise from fay s identity @xcite .",
    "this identity states that , for any points @xmath15 on a compact riemann surface of genus @xmath16 , and for any @xmath17 , there exist scalars @xmath18 depending on the points @xmath15 , such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the multi - dimensional theta function ( [ theta ] ) ; here and below we use the notation @xmath21 for the abel map ( [ abel ] ) between a and b. while the authors in @xcite used generalized theta functions and generalized jacobians ( going back to investigations of clebsch and gordan @xcite ) , we derive the solutions from the identity ( [ fay intro ] ) .",
    "this fits into the program formulated by mumford @xcite that all algebro - geometric solutions to integrable equations should be obtained from fay s identity and suitable degenerations thereof .",
    "historically this approach was only able to reproduce solutions already obtained via so - called baker - akhiezer functions , generalizations of the exponential function to riemann surfaces .",
    "the first example of new solutions found via the fay identity was by one of the authors @xcite for the multi - component nonlinear schrdinger equations , see also @xcite .",
    "both methods have specific advantages : for the baker - akhiezer approach , solutions to the associated linear system the integrability condition of which is the studied equation have to be constructed on a riemann surface for a given singularity structure . for the mumford approach",
    "the non - trivial task is the finding of a suitable degeneration of the fay identity for the studied equation .",
    "once this is done the identification of certain constants in the solutions as well as the study of reality ans smoothness conditions is then in general more straight forward than in the baker - akhiezer approach .",
    "we provide here the first example for an integrable equation with nonlocal terms in the evolutionary form ( [ chevo ] ) as explained there .",
    "the spectral data for the theta - functional solutions to ch consist of a hyperelliptic curve of the form @xmath22 with three marked points : two of them are interchanged under the involution @xmath23 , and the third is a ramification point @xmath24 .",
    "our construction of real valued solutions is based on the description of the real and imaginary part of the jacobian associated to a real hyperelliptic curve ( i.e. , the branch points @xmath25 are real or pairwise conjugate non - real ) . in this way , one gets purely transcendental conditions on the parameters ( i.e. , without reference to a divisor defined by the solution of a jacobi inversion problem ) , such that the solutions are real - valued and smooth .",
    "it turns out that continuous real valued solutions are either smooth or have an infinite number of cusp - type singularities .",
    "concrete examples for the resulting solutions are studied numerically by using the code for real hyperelliptic surfaces @xcite .",
    "this code uses so - called spectral methods to compute periods on the surfaces .",
    "it allows also to study numerically almost degenerate surfaces where the branch points collapse pairwise . in this limit ,",
    "the theta functions break down to elementary functions , and the solutions describe solitons or cusps .",
    "it is noteworthy that the theta - functional solutions thus contain as limiting cases all known solutions to the ch equation .",
    "the quality of the numerics is ensured by testing the identities between theta functions which are used to construct the ch solutions in this paper . in addition , the solutions are computed on a grid and are numerically differentiated .",
    "these independent tests ensure that the shown solutions are correct to much better than plotting accuracy .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we summarize important facts on riemann surfaces , especially fay s identities for theta functions and results on real surfaces . in section 3",
    "we use fay s identities to rederive theta - functional solutions to the ch equation , and give reality and smoothness conditions . in section 4",
    "we study numerically concrete examples , also in almost degenerate situations .",
    "we add some concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "in this section we recall basic facts on riemann surfaces , in particular real surfaces and multi - dimensional theta functions defined on them .",
