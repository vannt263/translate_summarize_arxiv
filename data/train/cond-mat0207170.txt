    "the discovery of an apparent metallic state in si - metal oxide semiconductor ( mos ) structures @xcite has attracted much attention as it seemed to contradict the two - dimensional ( 2d ) localization behavior @xcite . it was found that above a critical carrier concentration @xmath0 , the resistivity strongly decreases with decreasing temperature @xmath1 ( metallic regime ) , whereas it increases for lower densities @xmath2 ( insulating regime ) .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath3 shows a critical behavior around @xmath0 @xcite .    at first the discovery of the metallic state in two dimensions",
    "was met with great scepticism .",
    "but the metal - to - insulator transition ( mit ) was confirmed first in si - mos structures from a different source @xcite and further in several other 2d material systems , which are n- and p- sige and algaas and n - alas structures ( for references see @xcite ) .",
    "after these experimental findings , the question was raised whether the metallic behavior manifests a new electronic ground state with dominating quantum behavior or if the strong resistivity drop towards low @xmath1 is based on familiar ( i.e.  non coherent ) effects ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite and references therein ) .    in this work",
    ", we report on the finding of a metallic state in silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) structures . in section  [ sec : experiment ] , on the experiment , we describe the investigated samples and the setup .",
    "we further present the data on the temperature and the magnetic field dependence of the resistivity and we show the mobility versus density behavior .",
    "the experimental results of the soi system are compared in detail with the properties of si - mos structures and the differences are discussed .",
    "the discussion of the results follows in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "here we discuss and compare five important suggestions on the physical origin of the metallic state in two dimensions .",
    "it turns out that the coherent interaction corrections to the conductivity in the ballistic regime @xcite are able to describe the observed resistivity behavior quite well . for the investigated regime",
    "also the temperature dependent screening of scattering potentials @xcite gives a fairly good description of the data .",
    "after a short summary , we describe in appendix  [ sec : appendixtrapmodel ] our numerical calculations on the charged trap state model in detail .",
    "our investigations were performed on two high - mobility soi structures which were prepared recently in finland .",
    "the soi hall bars have identical peak mobilities of @xmath4@xmath5/vs .",
    "they were fabricated on commercial unibond wafers produced by the smart - cut process @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the si - layer amounts 200 nm and that of the buried oxide layer 400 nm in these wafers .",
    "the background doping is n - type of about 10@xmath6@xmath7 which freezes out at low temperature .",
    "after a two - step thermal oxidation , the final thickness of the si - layer is 60 nm .",
    "the gate oxide thickness is about 90 nm with a dielectric strength of approximately 1v / nm .",
    "the electric contacts were phosphorus - implanted to an activated carrier concentration of @xmath8@xmath7 .",
    "the al - metallization is 300 nm thick and sintered at 400@xmath9c .",
    "a scheme of the final layer sequence is shown in figure [ fig : samplescheme ] .",
    "the etched hall bars have a size of 800@xmath10 m times 100@xmath10 m giving a length to width ratio of 8 .",
    "all resistivity and hall measurements were performed in a four terminal ac - technique at low frequencies of typically 13 or 17hz .",
    "the soi structures were investigated in a @xmath11he cryostat down to 1.4k .",
    "most investigations were performed on sample number l2 , sample l1 showed in several measurements practically the same behavior .",
    "the soi sample number l2 was intensively investigated in a density range from @xmath12 to @xmath13@xmath14 . at the low density side of this range ,",
    "the contacts became high ohmic .",
    "due to capacitive effects , the measured voltages showed a delay time of more than 100ms before they came into a steady state . thus voltage measurements in dc - technique lead to other values than those with the 13hz ac - technique .",
    "we limited our measurements to the range were the ac- and dc - technique gave the same results and performed all investigations in the ac - technique as this gives a better signal - to - noise ratio . at the higher limit of the investigated density range , the gate started to leak and the current between gate and sample would have lead to errors in the resistivity calculations .",
    "the investigations were thus kept in the above given density range .      from the resistivity and hall measurements , the carrier density @xmath15 and the mobility @xmath10",
    "were calculated assuming the linear drude behavior to be valid .",
    "this is not clear a priori as quantum interference effects might give relevant contributions to the conductivity and would alter the necessary evaluation .",
    "the possible importance of quantum effects will be discussed later in this work . for now , @xmath15 and @xmath10 should be used as apparent drude parameters for the 2d electron gas .",
    "we have evaluated the dependence of mobility @xmath10 on the electron density @xmath15 by varying the gate voltage @xmath16 at a constant temperature of @xmath17k . in fig .",
    "[ fig : msisoi ] , the @xmath18-dependence for soi is compared with that for several si - mos samples @xcite with different mobilities . the soi structure has a peak mobility @xmath19 of @xmath20@xmath5/vs at a density of @xmath21@xmath14 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : msisoi ] , the si - mos samples have lower or higher peak mobilities , depending on the sample quality , but the overall behavior of @xmath18 is very similar for the two sample types .    at high densities ,",
    "the electron wave function is squeezed by the strong electric field of the triangular potential towards the gate - sided si / sio@xmath22 interface and thus interface roughness scattering dominates . at low @xmath15 ,",
    "the dominating scattering process is caused by impurities . at the transition region between the two scattering mechanisms",
    ", the mobility reaches its peak value @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the most typical feature of the metallic state in 2d systems is expressed by the strong resistivity drop towards lower temperatures .",
    "this strong drop in @xmath23 is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsisoi]b for the soi sample in the range of @xmath24@xmath14 .",

    "for the two lower density curves with @xmath26 and @xmath27@xmath14 , an insulating behavior is observed .",

    "[ fig : rsisoi]a and [ fig : rsisoi]c the very high and medium mobility si - mos samples @xcite si-15 and si-4/32 with @xmath29 and @xmath30@xmath5/vs , respectively , are shown . in sample si-15 ,",
    "the strong decrease in @xmath23 is shifted to lower @xmath1 and the maximum decrease amounts up to a factor 7 , in si-4/32 the decrease is at somewhat higher @xmath1 in comparison to the soi structure and the maximum decrease is about a factor 3 .",
    "this shows a clear trend of the properties of the metallic regime with the sample quality , i.e.  the peak mobility @xmath19 and manifests the similarities between soi and si - mos structures .",
    "additionally , in fig .  [ fig : rsisoi ] , dashed - dotted lines at @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are shown .",
    "2 figure [ fig : rsisoisingle ] shows a direct comparison of the strong changes in @xmath23 for the four samples si-15 , si-43 , soi - l2 and si-4/32 for the same low-@xmath1 resistivity @xmath34 . the same behavior , as described above , is visible : the higher the peak mobility , the stronger is the change in @xmath23 and the lower is the temperature where the increase starts .    for si - mos structures",
    ", it was shown that the critical conductance @xmath35 changes systematically with the peak momentum relaxation time @xmath36 , which is a measure of the sample quality @xcite . here",
    "@xmath37 denotes the effective conductivity mass which is the transverse mass of the two lower lying valleys of @xmath38@xmath39 and @xmath40 the elementary charge . for the soi structure",
    ", @xmath41 is about @xmath42 and is compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : gctp ] with the values for several si - mos samples @xcite .",
    "it can be seen , that the @xmath41-value for soi coincides quite well with the general behavior of the si - mos samples .    as was seen so far",
    ", the soi structure behaves very similar to a high mobility si - mos sample .",
    "therefore , we ask the question : what are the similarities and differences between the two sample types ? due to the different effective masses @xmath37 perpendicular to the si / sio@xmath22 interfaces and due to strain effects , the six - fold conduction band ( cb ) degeneracy at the @xmath43-points of bulk si is lifted and only the two lower lying valleys with their longitudinal axis perpendicular to the 2d layer are occupied . the si layer in soi is only 60 nm thick , below there is the buried oxide layer , which constitutes also of a thermally grown oxide fabricated before the wafer bonding process .",
    "the active si - layer has an n - type background doping of about @xmath44@xmath7 which freezes out at low @xmath1 . in the si - mos samples ,",
    "the electrons are confined in the surface inversion layer of a nominally p - type doped bulk si crystal .",
    "our high mobility si - mos samples were doped with an acceptor density of about @xmath45@xmath7 .    due to the applied gate voltage @xmath16 , an approximately triangular potential well results for the electrons at the upper si / sio@xmath22 interface .",
    "nevertheless , the extension of the electronic wave function is different for the soi and the si - mos structure due to the different background doping . in the n - type soi structure ,",
    "the fermi level @xmath46 is pinned underneath the 2d layer between the donor level and the cb edge .",
    "the band bending below the 2d layer is therefore quite small . in p - type si - mos",
    ", there is a wide depletion layer of about 0.85@xmath10 m below the 2d layer , as @xmath46 is pinned here between the acceptor level and the valence band ( vb ) edge in the undistorted p - type region .",
    "the different band bending below the 2d layer has an influence on the extension of the wave functions especially for small electron densities .",
    "we have calculated the wave function @xmath47 and the triangular potential @xmath48 by solving the schrdinger and poisson equations in a self consistent way ( with @xmath49 the coordinate perpendicular to the interface layer ) . in order to solve the schrdinger equation , the charge distribution latexmath:[$\\rho(z ) \\propto    among the electrons",
    "were considered , thus giving a first order approximation of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "figure [ fig : psiwidth ] shows the width of the wave function versus electron density @xmath15 .",
    "the width of @xmath51 is defined as the length where the central 90 percent of the expectation probability @xmath52 is contained , with 5 percent at the left and at the right side ignored . for a high electron density of @xmath53@xmath14",
    "the width is with 7.6 and 9.2 nm nearly the same for both structures .    at lower densities , the difference in the width of @xmath51 increases .",
    "the depletion width of 0.85@xmath10 m at an acceptor density of @xmath54@xmath7 corresponds to a 2d charge density of @xmath55@xmath14 .",
    "thus , at that 2d electron density , the electric field at the si / sio@xmath22 interface is in si - mos twice as high as in the soi structure . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : psiwidth ] , the difference in the wave function extension is indeed large at that density . at still lower density ,",
    "the width saturates in si - mos , as the field from the conducting 2d electrons is less important than that from the acceptors in the depletion layer . on the opposite , the width in the soi structure further increases , as there is no electric field confinement from other charges than the conducting electrons itself .",
    "figure [ fig : psipot ] shows for comparison the potential shape @xmath48 and the wave function @xmath47 at @xmath56@xmath14 . at that density , the confining potential is much steeper in si - mos and thus the energy @xmath57 of the lowest electronic subband is with 31mev much higher than in soi with 14mev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : psipot ] , the difference in the width of the wave functions is also clearly visible and is caused by the difference in the potential steepness . for the case that higher subbands @xmath58 are occupied , the differences in their energies and extensions should be even larger .    in the considered density range ,",
    "the width of the wave function is always smaller than the si - layer thickness of the soi structure and thus the electron do not feel the lower si / sio@xmath22 interface towards the buried oxide layer . in order that such an effect could become significant , the si layer would have to be as thin as 20 nm for @xmath59@xmath14 and even thinner for higher densities .",
    "we have also investigated the soi structures in perpendicular and parallel ( i.e.  in - plane ) magnetic field @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ fig : rhobperp ] shows typical magnetoresistivity curves @xmath61 for @xmath60 perpendicular to the 2d layer for different densities at @xmath62k . for the lower densities , the weak localization peak around @xmath63 is clearly visible . at about 1 t , the shubnikov - de haas oscillations set in and gain strongly in amplitude towards higher magnetic fields . at around 4 t , the spin splitting is visible . the behavior in perpendicular magnetic field is again very similar to that of si - mos samples with comparable mobility .    for in - plane magnetic field , the relative change @xmath64 of the magnetoresistivity of soi sample l2",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhobpar ] for different densities at @xmath65k . at high densities of about @xmath66@xmath14 ,",
    "the changes are quite small , whereas for the lower densities there is a strong increase in @xmath67 by up to a factor 4 . at the lowest density of @xmath68@xmath14 ,",
    "the observed change is again lower than for the previous densities as can be seen from the crossing of the upper curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhobpar ] .",
    "this indicates a saturation of the strong increase in @xmath69 at about @xmath70@xmath14 .",
    "an even stronger @xmath71-dependence was observed in high - mobility si - mos structures in the metallic regime @xcite .",
    "again the changes were stronger for the lower densities @xmath15 .",
    "the increase with @xmath72 was first attributed to the spin polarization of the conducting electrons @xcite and later to the increase in disorder caused by the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a strong change of @xmath71 was also observed in p - type gaas / algaas structures .",
    "above , we have presented new results on the 2d metallic state in silicon - on - insulator structures and compared its properties with that of high - mobility si - mos samples . as the physical origin of the 2d metallic state is still an open question , we like to discuss the different possibilities in detail .",
    "there appear to remain five important suggestions for the 2d metallic state at low temperatures .",
    "these are ( i ) a new quantum mechanical ground state for electrons in a solid , ( ii ) scattering of electrons at charged hole traps in the oxide layer , ( iii ) interband scattering between different bands , ( iv ) temperature dependent screening of impurity scattering , and ( v ) coherent interaction corrections in the ballistic regime .",
    "if the first suggestion proves to be correct , the 2d mit would indeed be the manifestation of some new physics , whereas the next three suggestions are based on settled physical phenomena , which may be described by terms like conventional , semiclassical or non - coherent ( on the first sight ) .",
    "the fifth suggestion was proposed quite recently and it has to be discussed whether it can be classified in the terminology used above or not .      the first suggestion ( i ) of a new quantum mechanical ground state is based on the scalability of the resistance in the neighborhood of the apparent mit in high - mobility si - mos structures @xcite .",
    "it was found that the @xmath73-curves for @xmath74 and for @xmath75 can be brought to coincidence on two distinct curves for the insulating and the metallic regime , respectively , by scaling the temperature with @xmath76 .",
    "the scaling parameter exhibits a power law @xmath77 , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 . such a critical scaling behavior indicates the metal - insulator transition to be a quantum phase transition @xcite .    the seminal paper on the absence of quantum diffusion in two dimensions @xcite was based on the assumption of non - interacting electrons .",
    "in this case the weak localization contribution decreases the conductivity and leads to continuing higher resistivities with decreasing temperatures . in the recent quantum - phase - transition models for the unexpected mit in 2d , the electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction plays a dominant role @xcite .",
    "the quantum coherent interaction corrections consist of positive and negative contributions to the conductivity and may lead to a decrease of the resistivity under certain conditions@xcite . in any case , quantum coherence is a prerequisite that the mit can be a quantum phase transition .    a metallic behavior , i.e.  a strong drop in the resistivity , was not only observed in the near vicinity of the critical concentration @xmath0 but also far away , for densities up to @xmath80@xmath14 ( i.e.  more than 10 times @xmath0 ) . as the decrease in @xmath23 looks quite similar near @xmath0 and far away",
    ", it is quite instructive to look for quantum effects over an extended density range . in a recent work @xcite , the temperature dependence of the weak localization was investigated in the metallic state of high - mobility si - mos structures in order to find the borders of quantum coherence . in that work , the temperature threshold @xmath81 for the single - electron quantum coherence",
    "was deduced from the crossing point of the temperature dependence of the phase coherence time @xmath82 and the momentum relaxation time @xmath83 . when @xmath84 , the coherence time is long enough that an electron can return in the coherent state to its origin whereas for @xmath85 this is not possible .",
    "it was found for the si - mos system @xcite that for @xmath86@xmath14 , the strong decrease in @xmath23 takes place above @xmath81 and thus should not be related to a single - electron coherent effect .",
    "also the second border @xmath87 lies below the strong resistivity drop at still higher densities . therefore also the e - e interaction induced quantum corrections to conductivity should not be responsible for the resistivity drop in this regime .",
    "this should at least be deduced in the picture where quantum coherent effects and screening are attributed to two different physical phenomena .",
    "but recently an interesting paper by zala et al .  has appeared @xcite , which may indicate that the two before mentioned effects are caused by the same physics .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail later in this work .    in any case , the work on the borders for quantum coherence @xcite is strictly applicable only in the higher density regime and does not give a direct answer on the importance of quantum coherence in the close vicinity of the critical density @xmath0 .",
    "in a recent work , punnoose and finkelstein show @xcite by a renormalization group analysis that especially for high - mobility si - mos structures , the presence of two degenerate conduction band valleys , stabilizes and enhances coherent e - e interaction effects in the vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "they are able to describe the temperature dependent changes in conductance in an @xmath15-range between 0.83 and @xmath88@xmath14 without any adjustable parameter .",
    "so it is quite surprising that at low @xmath15 the whole drop in @xmath89 seems to come from quantum coherent interaction effects while at high @xmath15 the drop takes place without quantum coherence and nevertheless the strong @xmath1-dependence looks so similar in the different regions .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the metallic and insulating behavior belong to a quantum phase transition or not .",
    "this work focuses on the metallic regime and will not be able to judge on the metal - to - insulator transition itself .",
    "the second suggestion ( ii ) on the scattering of electrons at charged hole traps in the oxide layer by altshuler and maslov ( am ) @xcite is prepared especially for si - mos structures with the si / sio@xmath22 interface on the gated side of the 2d layer .",
    "the same model should be applicable also for our soi structures , as an equivalent si / sio@xmath22 interface is present for the 2d electron confinement .",
    "it is well known that in the sio@xmath22 interface layer there exist several types of defects states @xcite . in the am model",
    ", it is assumed that a relative large number of hole trap states exists at a certain trap energy @xmath90 , which is spatially homogeneously distributed in the oxide layer .",
    "it is further assumed that these trap state lie at a well defined energy @xmath91 if no external electric field is applied .",
    "the potential gradient due to an applied gate voltage @xmath16 causes a linear increase of the trap energy position . in order to describe the total energy of the trap states , also",
    "the mirror charge of the traps inside the 2d electron gas has to be included .",
    "this leads to a down bending or the energetic position towards the interface and causes a maximum in the total trap energy @xmath92 , with @xmath49 the position inside the oxide layer ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : trap_energy ] in appendix [ sec : appendixtrapmodel ] ) .",
    "when the fermi energy lies below certain trap states at energies @xmath92 ( for low @xmath15 ) these states are positively charged and cause a large scattering probability for the 2d electrons . at high densities all trap states lie below @xmath46 and only due to the boltzmann occupation tail , an exponentially small number of traps contributes to the electron scattering .",
    "the charged trap states form dipoles together with their mirror charge in the 2d layer which has to be taken into account in the calculation of the scattering cross section .    in order to calculate the resistivity",
    ", one needs to know how the fermi energy @xmath46 varies with the temperature @xmath1 ( in the work of am , the chemical potential at @xmath93 is called the fermi energy @xmath46 whereas the chemical potential at @xmath94 is denoted by @xmath95 ; in this work we use @xmath96 instead ) .",
    "am suggest two scenarios for the @xmath1 dependence of the fermi energy of the 2d electron gas : ( a ) it coincides with the si substrate or ( b ) it is decoupled from the substrate .    for case",
    "( a ) , the calculation of @xmath23 by am show a behavior which looks quite similar to the observed temperature dependence near the critical density @xmath0 for high mobility si - mos structures .",
    "the strong increase in @xmath89 with increasing @xmath1 occurs around @xmath97 as then the occupied trap states are partially emptied ( and charged ) due to the broadening of the fermi occupation function and the scattering rate is increased accordingly . for case ( a ) , the insulating and metallic regions are distributed quite symmetrically around the separatrix which occurs for @xmath98 .    for case ( b )",
    ", the resistivity is decreasing in both regimes ( @xmath99 ) according to the calculations of am @xcite and seems to be unable to explain the experimentally observed behavior . as mentioned by am , the more realistic case is ( b ) as the depletion layer isolates the 2d electron gas from the substrate and both regions should have different quasi fermi energies .",
    "this is also verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "this situation causes some difficulty in order to apply the charge trap model to the high - mobility si - mos structures as well as to the soi samples considered in this work .",
    "we have performed numerical calculations of the am - trap model for the soi data .",
    "these calculations are described in appendix a in detail .",
    "if one applies an increasing gate voltage @xmath16 in order to increase the electron density @xmath15 in the 2d layer , the spatial maximum in the trap energy shifts quite fast to lower energies .",
    "this leads to a strong occupation of the trap states as soon as the maximum shifts below the fermi energy @xmath46 and the scattering efficiency decreases drastically . in fig.[fig : rho_trap_soi ] , we have calculated the @xmath23 dependence at an intermediate temperature of @xmath100k , where we have a set of measurement data .",
    "the temperature @xmath101 was chosen so that @xmath102 is for a large density interval neither in the low-@xmath1 saturation nor in the `` normal '' high-@xmath1 regime .",
    "the resistivity behavior should be dominated by thermal excitation of carriers according to the am - trap model .",
    "the low-@xmath1 saturation of @xmath23 in the metallic regime can not be described with the am - trap model alone , as all traps get filled according to the exponential boltzmann - tail and the resistivity tends to zero . only by assuming additional residual scattering centers , the resistivity saturates .",
    "we have evaluated the measurement data at @xmath101 only for densities where the low-@xmath1 saturation should not have a large influence yet .",
    "figure [ fig : rho_trap_soi ] shows that the decrease in resistivity vs.  density is too strong by many orders of magnitude in the am - trap model . at @xmath103@xmath14",
    ", @xmath89 should be below @xmath104 .",
    "this low value results from a very small number of positively charged trap states according to the fermi - dirac occupation function . temperature dependent screening effects were not considered in this calculation as they give only a change in @xmath89 by one or two orders of magnitude , but the calculated resistivity is by about 30 orders of magnitude too small compared with the measured values . in the same density interval ,",
    "the measured resistivity decreases just by about one order of magnitude , which appears as a nearly flat line on the scale of figure [ fig : rho_trap_soi ] .",
    "we conclude on the am - trap model that it can not explain the experimental behavior of the soi ( and similarly of the si - mos ) samples at intermediate temperatures as the carrier freeze out on the trap states occurs by far too fast if the trap maximum is below @xmath46 .",
    "further improvements of the am - model may be possible , but one has to note that the addition of trap states at other energies or the energetical broadening of the trap states around @xmath90 destroys the critical behavior around @xmath0 and the modified model would probably not be able to describe the abrupt metal to insulator transition .    moreover , case ( a ) of the trap model by am seems to be able to explain the @xmath23 dependence only in a very narrow density range around @xmath0 but can not explain the metallic behavior for the wide @xmath15 range as observed in si - mos and soi samples .",
    "thus it seems to be possible that the hole trap model in the present form may explain some important contributions to @xmath23 in si - mos and soi but is unable to describe the whole temperature dependence . as mentioned above ,",
    "the am model is especially prepared for samples with an sio@xmath22 oxide layer as on border of the 2d electron gas .",
    "the model will thus probably not be able to explain the metal - insulator transition in other material systems with strong changes in @xmath23 like p - type algaas or si / sige . on the other hand , it is not clear anyway whether the apparent metal - insulator phase transition has a universal origin or if it is caused by several different effects in the different material systems .",
    "the third suggestion ( iii ) is attributed to interband scattering between different conduction or valence bands .",
    "the correlation between the existence of two conduction bands and the metallic behavior was proposed by pudalov for si - mos.@xcite he assumed that the spin - orbit coupling due to the asymmetry of the inversion layer potential is strong enough in order to create the splitting . but the calculation of the spin - orbit coupling is not straight forward and have to be performed with great care.@xcite a later estimate by pudalov et al .",
    "@xcite gives a clearly smaller value for the spin - orbit coupling constant of @xmath105kcm , so that the corresponding splitting should not be the origin of the metallic behavior in si - mos structures . for p - type algaas papadakis et al",
    ".  have argued @xcite on the spin - orbit coupling due to the inversion asymmetry of the electron layer potential , but it turned out that the effect is due to an anomalous behavior of the magneto - oscillations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the apparent metallic behavior in p - type algaas layers strongly points towards a two - band transport effect .",
    "@xcite there , the heavy hole band is split and inelastic interband coulomb scattering between the two bands with different dispersion takes place .",
    "this was confirmed by magnetotransport measurements , where the positive magnetoresistance is attributed to the classical two - band scattering effect .",
    "but for n - type si - based heterostructures , the two - band transport should not be of great importance , as the conduction band splitting seems to be rather small .",
    "the forth suggestion ( iv ) on temperature dependent screening evolves from calculations of the mobility versus electron density dependence for si - mos @xcite , si / sige @xcite and iii - v @xcite structures in the 80th . in these early works ,",
    "the resulting @xmath23-dependence was assumed to be relative small .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity is dominated by the behavior of the screening function @xmath106 . for @xmath93 ,",
    "this function has a distinct kink at @xmath107 with @xmath108 the fermi wave vector . for higher @xmath1 ,",
    "this kink is smeared out @xcite and changes the scattering efficiency especially for @xmath109 .",
    "thus for large angle scattering , the temperature dependence of the screening function strongly influences the scattering efficiency .",
    "gold and dolgopolov give analytic results for the screening @xcite that consist of linear - in-@xmath1 and @xmath110 terms @xmath111^{3/2 } ,    \\label{eq : dsigmagold}\\ ] ] with @xmath112 , @xmath113 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath114 a constant depending whether the scattering is dominated by impurities ( @xmath115 ) or by surface - roughness ( @xmath116 ) .",

    "<S> it is shown that the electronic conduction in silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) layers exhibits a metallic regime which is very similar to that in high - mobility si - metal oxide semiconductor structures ( mos ) . </S>",
    "<S> the peak in the electron mobility versus density , the strong drop in resistivity and the critical concentration for the metal - insulator transition are all consistent . on the basis of our soi data for the temperature and in - plane magnetic field dependence of the resistivity , we discuss several models for the metallic state in two dimensions . </S>",
