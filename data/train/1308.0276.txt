    "observational data on the large - scale structure of the universe and on the cosmic microwave background indicate that at large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic and its geometry is well described by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric . because of the high symmetry ,",
    "numerous physical problems are exactly solvable on this background and a better understanding of physical effects in frw models could serve as a handle to deal with more complicated geometries .",
    "in particular , the investigation of quantum effects at the early stages of the cosmological expansion has been a subject of study in many research papers ( see birr82 for early investigations and @xcite-@xcite and references therein for later developments ) .",

    "the nontrivial properties of the vacuum are among the most interesting predictions of the quantum field theory .",
    "they are sensitive to both the local and global characteristics of the background spacetime in the early universe .",
    "in particular , the properties of the vacuum state can be changed by the imposition of boundary conditions on the field operator .",
    "these conditions may be induced either by the presence of physical boundaries , like material boundaries in qed , or by the nontrivial topology of the background space .",
    "the both types of boundary conditions give rise to the modification of the spectrum for the vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field and , as a result , to the change in the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of various physical observables .",

    "<S> we evaluate the two - point functions of the electromagnetic field in @xmath0-dimensional spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker universes with a power - law scale factor , assuming that the field is prepared in the bunch - davies vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> the range of powers are specified in which the two - point functions are infrared convergent and the bunch - davies vacuum for the electromagnetic field is a physically realizable state . </S>",
    "<S> the two - point functions are applied for the investigation of the vacuum expectation values of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor , induced by a single and two parallel conducting plates . unlike to the case of conducting plates in the minkowski bulk , in the problem under consideration the stresses along the directions parallel to the plates are not equal to the energy density . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in addition to the diagonal components , the vacuum energy - momentum tensor has a nonzero off - diagonal component which describes energy flux along the direction normal to the plates . for a single plate </S>",
    "<S> this flux is directed from the plate . </S>",
    "<S> the casimir forces are investigated in the geometry of two plates . at separations between the plates smaller than the curvature radius of the background spacetime , to the leading order , we recover the corresponding result in the minkowski spacetime and in this case the forces are attractive . at larger separations , the influence of the curvature on the casimir forces is essential with different asymptotic behavior for decelerated and accelerated expansions . in particular , for the latter case there is a range of powers of the expansion law in which the forces become repulsive at large separations between the plates .    </S>",
