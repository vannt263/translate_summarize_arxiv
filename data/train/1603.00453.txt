    "in this work we consider how certain techniques developed in the study of systems with quenched disorder may be used in the context of string theory .",
    "the rough picture goes as follows : consider wrapping branes on complicated cycles within some compact manifold such that the branes are point - like in the non - compact space .",
    "these internal cycles can intersect amongst each other and amongst themselves , giving rise to a large number of light degrees of freedom localized at the brane intersections .",
    "moreover , the different intersection modes can further interact with each other via some stringy processes .",
    "if the charges of the point - like branes in the non - compact directions , which are given by the cohomology of the cycles they wrap , become large enough we expect them to backreact into a charged extremal black hole .",
    "we expect several of the features of such black holes to be governed by the effective quantum mechanical theory obtained upon reducing the wrapped cycles to the lowest kaluza - klein modes .",
    "generically this will be governed by some rather complicated hamiltonian , coupling the large number of intersection modes between each other .",
    "the parameters of this hamiltonian will result from difficult calculations involving the detailed structure of the compactification manifold .",
    "but perhaps , to some good approximation , they can simply be treated as a collection of random variables .",
    "if , in addition , these random variables evolve on time scales much larger than that of the intersection modes themselves , they may be viewed as quenched disorder .",
    "our interest is to analyze the effect of this type of quenched disorder in a particular quantum mechanical model motivated from string theory .",
    "this approach is similar in spirit to wigner s @xcite , who analyzed the spectral properties of heavy nuclei by approximating their hamiltonian by a random matrix .",
    "the model we consider is a supersymmetric quantum mechanics with four supercharges @xcite .",
    "the matter content is organized in a quiver diagram , with bifundamental fields connecting different nodes and adjoint fields residing on the nodes .",
    "these models have been argued to describe , at weak coupling , the low energy physics of branes wrapping different cycles in a calabi - yau compactification .",
    "the adjoint matter describes the degrees of freedom of the brane s motion in the non - compact directions , and the bifundamentals capture the intersection modes in the internal cycles .",
    "interestingly , certain types of quivers exhibit an exponentially large number of ground states @xcite ( in the large intersection number limit ) reminiscent of the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the extremal black holes they are supposed to describe at strong coupling",
    ". the hamiltonian of these models is highly constrained by supersymmetry , but it does allow for a superpotential which leads to interactions between the different intersection modes .",
    "the coefficients of this superpotential are in principle fixed by an often prohibitively difficult calculation depending on many of the details of the compactification manifold and its internal cycles .",
    "it is these superpotential coefficients that we take to be random in this paper , as a first step toward our broader goal .",
    "the extremal black holes that the branes backreact into have several features of interest such as an ads@xmath5 near horizon with an @xmath6 symmetry and the possible fragmentation of this throat into a multitude of split horizons @xcite .",
    "it was previously shown that the classically chaotic @xcite quiver models on the coulomb branch , i.e. when the branes are separated in the non - compact space , are described in the low energy limit by an @xmath6 invariant multi - particle mechanics @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the @xmath6 invariant mechanics @xcite defined by the motion of the tips in the fragmented extremal throat .",
    "we focus instead on the higgs branch of the model , where the branes are sitting on top of each other and the intersection modes are light . in order to analyze this branch , we invoke the replica trick which involves considering @xmath7 replicas of the original system . upon integrating out the random disorder ,",
    "these replicas interact amongst each other . at large intersection number @xmath0 ,",
    "the system is described by a collection of @xmath8 replica matrices @xmath9 .",
    "the ` paramagnetic ' case @xmath10 is shown to be perturbatively stable .",
    "moreover , as speculated in @xcite , we find that the disorder averaged theory exhibits an emergent time reparametrization symmetry at low temperatures , containing an @xmath6 subgroup .",
    "this is reminiscent of the symmetry found in the near horizon region of extremal black holes @xcite .",
    "this is very similar to the situation encountered in several models of quenched quantum systems , such as the system recently considered in @xcite .",
    "additionally , we study the low temperature thermodynamics of the system .",
    "we show that the specific heat at low temperatures grows linearly .",
    "interestingly , the specific heat of near extremal black holes has a similar linear growth in @xmath11 . in appendix [ fermionm ]",
    "we discuss how a simple model of free fermions with random masses also exhibits several of these features .",
    "finally , we establish that the coulomb branch and higgs branch @xmath6 invariant sectors are distinct ",
    "the scaling dimensions of the fields in each sector is different .",
    "we also initiate the study of more general replica symmetric and replica symmetry breaking saddles , but leave a complete analysis of this question to future work .",
    "the quantum mechanical theories of interest in this paper have four supercharges @xcite .",
    "the matter content resides in a chiral multiplet @xmath12 containing a complex scalar @xmath13 , a complex weyl spinor spinor index which we are suppressing .",
    "the @xmath14 transform in the @xmath15 of @xmath16 and @xmath17 transform in the @xmath18 . ] @xmath19 and an auxiliary complex scalar @xmath20 . the index",
    "@xmath21 indicates a particular intersection mode connecting two branes , and the index @xmath22 represents the particular pair of branes being connected .",
    "we consider a cyclic quiver with three nodes ( and hence three branes ) , i.e. @xmath23 , since it is the simplest case and the general @xmath24-node cyclic case turns out to be qualitatively similar .",
    "the euclidean action contains a standard kinetic piece:@xmath25 as well as interactions governed by a holomorphic superpotential @xmath26 : @xmath27 repeated indices are summed throughout our discussion unless otherwise specified .",
    "the theory has an @xmath16 symmetry generated by @xmath28 .",
    "notice that the above expression also contains an @xmath16 invariant term @xmath29 containing the @xmath30 @xmath31-tensor which is contracted by the ( suppressed ) spinor indices of the fermions .",
    "the supersymmetry transformations act as follows : @xmath32 we will work with a specific holomorphic superpotential : @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 a set of constants.since @xmath26 contains no quadratic piece , the bosons @xmath13 and fermions @xmath19 are all massless",
    ". there can be higher order terms , but we will only consider the lowest order one .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , these theories can be viewed as low energy effective actions arising from the dynamics of open strings living at the intersection points of branes wrapped along internal cycles in the compactification manifold .",
    "the branes are point like in the non - compact dimensions , and we are discarding their position degrees of freedom ( which comprise a vector multiplet ) by making them parametrically massive .",
    "a more complete analysis would include these degrees of freedom .",
    "we briefly discuss their effect in section [ coulomb ] . for large values of @xmath0 the point - like branes can backreact into extremal black holes with an ads@xmath45 throat in the near horizon geometry .",
    "the details of the coefficients @xmath35 are contained in the geometry of the compactification manifold and the specific cycles wrapped by the branes .",
    "it is in general rather complicated to compute the exact values of @xmath35 .",
    "therein lies the basic assumption of our paper .",
    "we take the @xmath35 to be random coefficients drawn independently from a gaussian probability distribution with variance @xmath46 and vanishing mean .",
    "moreover we assume that the disorder is quenched , such that we must average over the disorder only upon computing a particular extensive , physical quantity such as the free energy . in what follows",
    "we analyze the implications of such quenched disorder .",
    "the supersymmetric ground state sector of these models has been the subject of extensive work @xcite . by evaluating a witten index , the particular model under consideration",
    "was shown to have an exact ground state degeneracy that grows as @xmath47 in the large @xmath0 limit @xcite .",
    "our main interest in what follows regards the low temperature non - supersymmetric sector of the model which has been far less explored .      in order to compute the two - point function we consider the euclidean partition function at finite temperature : .",
    "for example , we denote the dimensionless quantity @xmath48 by @xmath49 and reinstate factors of @xmath50 when necessary . ]",

    "the bosonic degrees of freedom are periodic around the thermal circle @xmath53 and the fermonic degrees of freedom are anti - periodic . for a given realization of disorder",
    "the above partition function is too complicated to analyze .",
    "however for large enough systems , disorder - averaged quantities get at the essential physics .",
    "since the disorder is quenched , the main quantity of interest is the averaged free energy , given by the logarithm of @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "we express this as ( with overlines denoting disorder averages ) : @xmath55}=-t\\,\\overline{\\log z_\\omega [ t ] } = -t\\lim_{n \\to 0 } \\partial_n   \\overline{\\left(z_\\omega[t]\\right)^n}~.\\ ] ] at this point take @xmath7 to be an integer , such that we can view @xmath56)^n$ ] as @xmath7-replicas of the original system .",
    "the average over the quenched disorder is performed over this replicated system , and the basic assumption is that the final results can be analytically continued to real @xmath7 .",
    "this assumption is known in the literature as the replica trick , and is a basic tool in analyzing simple models of spin glasses . as a warm up example in using the replica trick",
    ", we provide a simple solvable case of free fermions with a random mass matrix in appendix [ fermionm ] .    upon integrating out the disorder we find an effective action for the replicated degrees of freedom @xmath57 which now cary an additional replica index @xmath58 . for our choice of superpotential",

    "the kinetic action @xmath64 is the replicated version of the original ( [ skin ] ) : @xmath65    notice that upon integrating out the disorder we have coupled the replica indices .",
    "also note that since the original action is bounded from below , the path integral over the replica matrices must be well defined for all @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , ( [ seffdisorder ] ) is invariant under the same supersymmetry transformations as the original action .",
    "this is to be expected , since the theory is supersymmetric for any given realization of the variables @xmath67 .",
    "at this point we introduce replica matrices : @xmath68 and delta - functionals implementing the on - shell conditions : @xmath69 where we use the generalized index @xmath70 to specify the node index @xmath71 and the field type , i.e. @xmath72 , @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",

    "we are interested in a particular large @xmath0 limit , which we will now specify .",
    "we rescale @xmath87 and keep @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath86 fixed as @xmath90 . with this large @xmath0 limit all exponents in the effective action scale as @xmath0 .",
    "it follows from ( [ zeff ] ) and ( [ source ] ) that the saddle point value of the @xmath91 computes the various disorder averaged , equilibrium , two - point functions : @xmath92 it is useful to note that several of these @xmath91 will vanish .",
    "( for example , they might involve a single fermionic field .",
    ") moreover , there will always be a large @xmath0 saddle point for which the replica matrices @xmath91 all have @xmath93",
    ". this saddle will be perturbatively stable against fluctuations in the @xmath94 directions .",
    "we study such saddles in what follows , since they already contain a lot of interesting phenomena . in the @xmath93 subspace ,",
    "the effective action simplifies considerably .",
    "thus we can simplify our notation slightly .",
    "we denote : @xmath95 in the above expressions , only the greek indices are summed over , and the index @xmath96 for the fermionic variables is the @xmath16 spinor index .",

    "moreover , time reversal invariance implies for the diagonal components of the replica matrices : @xmath105 which is moreover a real function . for the fermions",
    ", @xmath106 is a real odd function of @xmath107 . in",
    "what follows , it will also be convenient to consider expressions in frequency space as well : @xmath108 note that @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where the @xmath111 are the fourier coefficients of @xmath112 and so on .",
    "this in turn implies @xmath113 is a real even function , and @xmath114 .",
    "the action ( [ effectiveaction ] ) is symmetric among the replica indices @xmath115 . however , as is the case in spin glass models , replica symmetry can be spontaneously broken . in this section",
    "we discuss whether or not replica symmetry is broken in the model described above . to understand this question",
    ", one must understand the dominant contribution to the partition function at large @xmath0 .",
    "in several simple models of quantum systems with quenched disorder @xcite , when replica symmetry is broken it indicates a transition to a glassy phase . a way to determine",
    "the presence of replica symmetry breaking is to study fluctuations about a replica symmetric saddle of the free energy and to see whether it is locally stable .",
    "it follows from an argument in @xcite that when @xmath116 , the replica matrices must be time independent .",
    "the argument uses the fact that different replicas are decoupled before the disorder is integrated out .",
    "hence the two - point function of two fields carrying different replica indices must factorize into a product of their respective one - point functions . however , the equilibrium value of the one - point function for a fixed realization of disorder is @xmath117-independent . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath118 with @xmath119 is itself @xmath117-independent , i.e. @xmath120 with @xmath121 independent of @xmath117 and vanishing for @xmath122 .",
    "for @xmath101 , we have the even stronger condition that @xmath123 for @xmath116 since the equilibrium one - point function of a fermion @xmath124 vanishes identically . the simplest and most symmetric ansatz sets the @xmath125 , and we refer to this as the ` paramagnetic ' ansatz .",
    "we would like to understand if this ansatz is a stable solution of the saddle point equations stemming from the large-@xmath0 action .",
    "the linear fluctuation of @xmath77 must vanish at the saddle point and thus the question is whether all quadratic contributions locally increase the value of the action . expressing the fluctuations as @xmath126 with @xmath127 and expanding the effective action to second order in the fluctuations we find : @xmath128 in the above expression @xmath129 is defined such that @xmath130 notice that the quadratic fluctuation is positive definite .",
    "thus , at least locally , the paramagnetic ansatz remains stable for all values of the temperature .",
    "this does not bar the possibility of a lower free energy configuration , only that such a configuration will be reached by non - perturbative fluctuations away from the paramagnetic one .",
    "though the paramagnetic ansatz is perturbatively stable , we can still ask whether replica symmetry breaking takes place in this model . though we do not analyze this question extensively in this work",
    ", we will make some brief comments in this section .",
    "first we need to study the simplest replica symmetric , yet non - paramagnetic , ansatz : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the matrix with vanishing diagonal terms and ones otherwise .",
    "we have dropped node and spinor indices , by assuming that in addition all the @xmath118 are equal amongst each other .",
    "the @xmath143 is a real constant independent of the frequency known as the edwards - anderson parameter in the spin glass literature @xcite .",
