    "impurities can act as probes for host materials .",
    "the kondo effect,@xcite which describes the screening of a single magnetic impurity embedded in a metal at low temperatures , is a striking example : screening occurs ( and can be probed locally ) , only when low - energy conduction electron - hole pairs are available .",
    "numerous generalizations of the kondo effect have been discussed over the last two decades , involving host systems such as superconductors,@xcite luttinger liquids,@xcite boundary states of topological insulators,@xcite and spin liquids.@xcite in many of these cases , the interaction between the impurity moment and the host excitations are non - trivial and lead to zero - temperature phase transitions@xcite which can be tuned by varying impurity or host parameters .",
    "a prominent and rich example is given by the so - called pseudogap kondo problem , describing a magnetic moment embedded in a system of weakly interacting fermions with a power - law vanishing density of states ( dos ) @xmath0 with @xmath4 .",
    "originally discussed in the context of unconventional superconductors,@xcite where @xmath5- and @xmath6-wave pairing symmetries yield @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , the problem has continued to attract much attention ; for example due to its realization in semimetals like graphene.@xcite the pseudogap kondo model displays various phases and quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) , which have been studied extensively using both numerical and analytical techniques.@xcite in particular , fermionic quantum field theories have been introduced and employed to calculate perturbatively critical properties in the vicinity of certain critical `` dimensions ''  i.e. special values of the bath exponent @xmath2.@xcite    the problem of a magnetic impurity coupled to fermions with a _ diverging _ dos , @xmath9 with @xmath1 ( hereafter referred to as the `` power - law kondo model '' ) , can also be realized : a band edge in one space dimension leads to a dos with @xmath10 , disordered two - dimensional dirac fermions can display a diverging dos with varying exponent , @xcite and a diverging dos might also appear at critical points within extensions@xcite of dynamical mean - field theory.@xcite the power - law kondo model was investigated previously in ref .   using wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg )",

    ". moreover , a kondo model with @xmath11 , i.e. a dos of the limiting form @xmath12 , has been proposed for vacancy - induced moments in graphene,@xcite and properties of this model have recently been investigated in detail using a combination of nrg and analytics in ref .  .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the rich physics of the power - law kondo model over the entire bath exponent range @xmath1 , for two reasons : ( i ) while the initial study@xcite was based mainly on nrg results , subsequent work on the positive-@xmath2 case@xcite has lead to substantial analytical insight into the structure of both the stable and quantum critical fixed points of the kondo model with @xmath13 bath dos . here",
    "we extend and apply these analytical concepts to the negative-@xmath2 case .",
    "( ii ) the physical observables obtained in ref .   were rather limited , and the limiting low - temperature properties were not correctly obtained.@xcite here we present new and highly - accurate numerical results for the full temperature - dependence of the impurity entropy and susceptibility as well as for critical exponents , complemented and confirmed by analytical results , over the entire range @xmath1 .",
    "as the main result , we are able to provide and analyze the critical field theories for all four intermediate - coupling fixed points of the problem . as in earlier work on related models , these field theories are not of landau - ginzburg - wilson type , but instead are fermionic in nature . using epsilon - expansion techniques , we calculate critical properties which we find in perfect agreement with numerical results .    the body of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we specify the power - law kondo model and introduce the observables to be discussed throughout the paper .",
    "the phase diagram of the model is reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : phd ] , supported and justified by numerical results . sec .",
    "[ sec : trivfp ] is devoted to a discussion of the ` trivial ' ( weak - coupling and strong - coupling ) fixed points of the model .",
    "due to the power - law host dos , most of these fixed points nevertheless display somewhat non - trivial thermodynamic properties , which we analyze using suitable effective models and mappings .",
    "these are the basis for the construction of critical field theories for the various _ intermediate_-coupling fixed points , which are subject of sec .",
    "[ sec : critfp ] .",
    "we sketch the renormalization group ( rg ) treatment of the field theories and calculate critical properties . throughout the paper , analytical results",
    "are compared with highly accurate numerical results obtained by nrg .",
    "a brief discussion will close the paper .",
    "the kondo hamiltonian for a spin-@xmath14 impurity can be written as @xmath15 , with the impurity part @xmath16 and the non - interacting conduction band described by @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 denotes a spin-@xmath14 operator for the impurity , and @xmath19 is the conduction electron spin density at the impurity site @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    for most of the discussion ,",

    "[ sec : asym ] below .",
    "importantly , many properties discussed in this paper , such as critical exponents and fixed - point observables , display universality in the sense that they are only determined by the behavior of @xmath26 at _ low _ energies ( assumed to be of the quoted power - law form ) and the presence or absence of p - h symmetry .",
    "as p - h asymmetry plays a singular role for the power - law kondo model at weak coupling , it is worth reviewing some of its properties . in a fermionic quantum impurity model , there are various sources of p - h asymmetry : ( i ) the conduction band dos can be asymmetric , @xmath27 . here",
    "we shall only consider a high - energy asymmetry , such that the low - energy dos is symmetric : @xmath28 for @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "this is the case relevant for graphene , unconventional superconductors etc .",
    "( ii ) the impurity can induce potential scattering at the local bath site to which it is coupled . in eq .",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "( iii ) the impurity orbital itself can be p - h asymmetric , if described by an anderson impurity model@xcite ( such asymmetry is obviously absent by construction in a kondo model ) .",
    "these sources of p - h asymmetry are usually considered to be qualitatively equivalent for the low - energy behavior , since they all influence the real part of the free bath green function at the impurity site .",
    "explicit links can be made as follows .",
    "first , the equivalence of ( iii ) and ( ii ) can be established in the singly - occupied kondo limit of an anderson impurity model via the schrieffer - wolff transformation.@xcite we note that this requires finite coulomb interaction in the anderson model , and does not hold for a non - interacting resonant level model .",
    "second , the equivalence of ( i ) and ( iii ) can be directly seen for an anderson model , where a real part of the bath green function simply renormalizes the impurity level position .",
    "third , the equivalence of ( i ) and ( ii ) follows in the framework of rg for a kondo model:@xcite integrating out the p - h asymmetric part of the bath generates a potential scatterer .",
    "this is seen most clearly in the case of a maximally asymmetric bath , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "then the weak - coupling beta functions for the dimensionless running couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 read@xcite @xmath35 to second order , with @xmath36 being the running uv cutoff .",
    "the @xmath37 term in the second equation is responsible for generating a finite @xmath38 as soon as @xmath39 is non - zero .",
    "these arguments do not depend on the value of the dos exponent @xmath2 , and so the different sources of p - h asymmetry remain equivalent for @xmath40 . in this paper",
    "we thus employ a p - h symmetric bath , eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) , using the potential scattering @xmath25 to tune p - h asymmetry .",
    "we note , however , that the exchange coupling @xmath41 and potential scattering @xmath42 are not independent parameters in the effective kondo model _ if _ derived from an underlying anderson model . as discussed in ref .  , the various phases of the kondo model in its most general form might not be accessible in the parent andersonian system .",
    "to pave the way for the discussion of the various phases of the power - law kondo model , we introduce relevant observables to characterize the impurity behavior .",
