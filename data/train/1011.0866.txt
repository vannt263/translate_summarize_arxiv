    "the possibility of @xmath1-nuclear quasi - bound states was first discussed by haider and liu @xcite , when it was realized that the @xmath1-nucleon interaction is attractive . nevertheless , the early ( @xmath4,p ) experiment looking for these effects was not conclusive @xcite .",
    "the reasons for uncertainties in the interpretation of those results is a high background and apparently large widths of those states due to predominantly to the @xmath5 conversion .",
    "recent detailed calculations @xcite indicate the states to be wide and difficult to extract experimentally .",
    "the view that the widths of nuclear @xmath1 states are large is widespread .",
    "calculations @xcite and especially those based on chiral models @xcite,@xcite , predict large widths .",
    "if the quasi - bound states exist , one expects these to be narrower , and easier to detect in the few - nucleon systems .",
    "indeed , an indirect evidence was suggested by wilkin @xcite , who interpreted a rapid slope of the @xmath6he low energy amplitude as a signal of a quasi - bound state .",
    "later , a very strong three - body @xmath7 correlations were found in measurements of the @xmath8 cross section in the threshold region @xcite .",
    "calculations indicate that the @xmath9 system forms a virtual state @xcite .",
    "the status of @xmath10he state is still unsettled .",
    "some of these results have been superseded by new experiments :    @xmath11 the final state interactions in the @xmath10he system obtained by cosy - anke determines large scattering length @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 the final state interactions in the @xmath13he system obtained by gem determines scattering length @xmath14 fm @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 the reaction @xmath15 studied by cosy - gem attributed @xmath16 to the state of @xmath17 nucleus .",
    "the energy @xmath18 mev was found @xcite .",
    "these findings require rather weak absorption and contradict many theoretical calculations based on the single channel @xmath1-n or multiple nucleon absorption models . in this paper",
    "the latest helsinki @xmath19-matrix model incorporating the @xmath1-n,@xmath4-n,@xmath20-n channels is used @xcite .",
    "it offers two characteristic features : large scattering length @xmath21 and a rapid decrease of the absorptive scattering amplitude in the subthreshold region .    _ the essential point of this work _ is the observation that in the few nucleon systems the relevant @xmath1-n , scattering amplitude involves subthreshold energies in the @xmath1-n center of mass system . the quantity of interest is @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are binding energies of a nucleon and the meson . to obtain the center of mass energy the recoil energy of the meson - nucleon pair with respect to the residual system has to be subtracted in the argument of @xmath25 .",
    "such amplitudes are the standard input in the three - body faddeev equations for the bound states and low energy scattering .",
    "there are other situations where the subthreshold amplitudes are appropriate : the interactions at nuclear surfaces and the tightly bound residual systems .",
    "to certain degree these situations are met in the states of @xmath1 mesons bound to light nuclei .    the absorptive part i m @xmath26 determines the dominant part of the level widths .",
    "it is proportional to the phase space in the @xmath4-n decay channel given by the center of mass energy @xmath27 .",
    "thus the argument @xmath28 given in eq.([f1 ] ) is proper , at least in the i m @xmath26 , for a much wider class of systems .",
    "extension to subthreshold energies reduces absorption in the @xmath1 systems .",
    "on the other hand there are additional effects which enhance the level width .",
    "one is the two nucleon absorption of the meson . in the eta case",
    "there is an experimental check on the related rate coming from the @xmath1 formation in the two nucleon collisions .",
    "this rate is low @xcite .",
    "another effect is the multiple scattering in the @xmath4-n decay channel .",
    "it goes beyond the optical potential approach and it is known to be significant on the k - mesic nuclei @xcite .",
    "these questions are discussed in the main body of this paper with the special reference to the three recent experimental results .    _ in conclusion _ : ( 1 ) there are models of @xmath1-n interactions which generate fairly narrow @xmath1 states in light nuclei .",
    "( 2 ) some systems in particular the @xmath29he are difficult to calculate precisely . due to the apparently large scattering length",
    "all secondary effects become significant .",
    "( 3 ) the nuclear states of @xmath0 mesons indicate a need for explicit description of the decay channels . this question should be approached also in the @xmath1 meson case .",
    "the latest helsinki @xmath19-matrix model incorporates the @xmath1-n , @xmath4-n , @xmath20-n channels .",
    "it is presented in refs . @xcite and",
    "only the main points are indicated here .",
    "the scattering data are parameterized in terms of a phenomenological @xmath30 - a matrix in the channel indices @xmath31 .",
    "next , linear equations for the scattering matrix t @xmath32 are solved with @xmath33 being the diagonal matrix of the cm momenta in each channel .",
    "the energy region of interest for the few body eta physics spans from about 40 mev below the eta - nucleon threshold to some 20 mev above it .",
    "this region is dominated , in both channels , by the @xmath3 .",
    "the model used here supposes this state to be determined by some short range interactions .",
    "next , this state is coupled to the channel states which change its properties .",
    "however , to obtain a better restriction of the parameters the region of the @xmath19 matrix description is extended to about 200 mev below and above the threshold .",
    "so , the higher n(1650 ) resonance is also included .",
    "the k matrix is parameterized as @xmath34 where the sum extends over two resonances represented by the pole terms .",
    "the @xmath35 couple these to the channels .",
    "the additional background matrix @xmath36 describes other forms of the interactions .",
    "these change the bare resonance energies @xmath37 to those observed in the scattering experiments .",
    "the free parameters @xmath38 obtained by the best fit to the data may be found in refs .",
    "one obtains several sets depending on the choice of the input data .",
    "the best result for the elastic @xmath1-n amplitude is plotted in fig.1 .",
    "it is only marginally better than other possibilities .",
    "the main difference happens in the value of @xmath39 reflected in different strength of the spike in re @xmath40 at the threshold i.e. the scattering length . on the other hand",
    "the absorptive part i m @xmath41 stays close to the `` canonical '' value of 0.27(2 ) fm .",
    "the rapid decrease of i m @xmath40 occurs in all solutions .",
    "-n scattering amplitude plotted against the c.m . kinetic energy .",
    "real part - continuous line , absorptive part - dashed line .",
    "this amplitude is well represented by the effective range expansion @xmath42 ,  with @xmath43 being the momentum in the @xmath44 center - of - mass and @xmath45 .",
    "all in @xmath46 units.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "in this section the @xmath1-he scattering lengths are calculated . the energy argument entering eq.([f1 ] ) in @xmath47he",
    "is determined by the nucleon separation @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 .",
    "the meson - nucleon recoil energy is a function of total pair momentum @xmath50 and the momentum distribution @xmath51 is calculable with the meson and nucleon wave functions @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the coordinate relative to the tritium ( or @xmath54he ) core .",
    "the @xmath55 is peaked around the average momentum and the average recoil is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the corresponding reduced mass . for low energy mesons one",
    "has @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 mev .",
    "the average subthreshold energy is @xmath61 mev and the amplitude becomes @xmath62 .",
    "for the other isotope @xmath54he the corresponding values are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 mev and @xmath66 fm .",
    "the width of momentum distribution is about 10 mev and inspection of fig.1 indicates that the @xmath67 is fairly constant in the regions of interest .",
    "these effective scattering matrices @xmath67 are now used to calculate the @xmath68 scattering lengths .",
    "the @xmath69-he multiple scattering series is summed according to the prescription of ref.@xcite equivalent to the calculation in terms of the optical potential .",
    "the latter is given in the standard way @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the nuclear density , @xmath72 is the @xmath1-n reduced mass and the index @xmath73 on @xmath74 indicates the single nucleon origin of this potential .",
    "@xmath11 for @xmath75he this input generates @xmath76 fm , which corresponds to a quasi - bound state of energy @xmath77 mev and width @xmath78 mev .",
    "this compares well with the experimental @xmath79fm , @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 in @xmath80he both the theoretical and experimental situation is uncertain as apparently the singularity in the @xmath81he scattering matrix is close to the threshold . on the experimental side cosy-11 @xcite obtains @xmath82 fm .",
    "this result is consistent with the phenomenological @xmath83 fm based on older data @xcite . in the latter case , the inclusion of @xmath84 data allowed to establish the sign of the real part which signals a virtual state .",
    "these lengths indicate that the related singularity of the @xmath85 matrix is located in the complex energy plane some 1.5 - 2 mev away from the threshold .",
    "on the other hand the cosy - anke solution is @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "this value indicate the pole to be only 0.3 mev away from the threshold . to obtain it",
    "one needs a strong suppression of the meson absorption .",
    "the photo - production result @xcite indicates a quasi - bound state of energy @xmath87 which corresponds to a much smaller scattering length .",
    "@xmath88 calculations of large scattering lengths are unstable .",
    "indeed , with equation ( [ pot1 ] ) and the effective @xmath89 obtained from fig1 .",
    "one obtains a large length @xmath90 fm .",
    "however , a simple correction introduced to the multiple scattering series , the replacement of @xmath91 by @xmath92 in the double scattering term , changes the result to @xmath93 fm .",
    "this shows the outcome to be unstable against second order effects .",
    "a better calculating techniques are also required .      in this section",
    "a crude estimate of the @xmath1 mesic level in @xmath94 mg is given .",
    "with the characteristic value of re @xmath95 fm the optical potential generates the @xmath1 binding of about 18 mev .",
    "the radius m.s . of the meson density distribution becomes 3.2 fm comparable to the charge density radius of 3.11 fm @xcite .",
    "thus the meson is mostly located in the region beyond the half density radius which in this nucleus is 2.76 fm .",
    "the nucleon separation energies are determined mostly by the upper single particle levels with an average about 15 - 20 mev . following fig.1 one obtains @xmath96 fm .",
    "this generates narrow width @xmath97 mev .",
    "one concludes that the suppression of the level widths can be understood at least on the semi - quantitative level .",
    "however , the binding offered by the k - matrix model seems to be excessive .",
    "in addition a number of higher order effects must be included :    \\1 ) two nucleon @xmath1nn capture .",
    "there is an experimental check on this effect to be discussed below .",
    "it adds some 1 - 2 mev to the width .",
    "\\2 ) interactions in the decay channel    \\3 ) nuclear medium effects change @xmath67 . in the light nuclei",
    "these are hard to calculate .",
    "the @xmath1 meson lifetime in a nucleus is determined by the basic reactions @xmath98",
    "@xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101      the other two reactions ( [ d2 ] ) and ( [ d3 ] ) correspond to @xmath1 absorption on two correlated nn pairs in either the spin singlet or spin triplet states .",
    "a phenomenological evaluation of the rates is possible as the cross sections for @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 have been measured in the close to threshold region .",
    "the analysis based on the detailed balance corrected for final state interaction has been performed in ref .",
    "absorptive potential of the @xmath105 profile with a weak strength i m @xmath106 mev was obtained .",
    "an additional absorption mode exists if the decay channel is described explicitly .",
    "it has been studied in terms of faddeev equations used to calculate the @xmath107 nn quasi - bound state energy @xcite .",
    "an explicit treatment of the multiple scattering in the decay channel generates an additional binding and enlarges the width of the state .",
    "similar effects are found in a variational calculations of the @xmath107- few- n levels @xcite .",
    "a simple model of the @xmath107 interacting with two fixed nucleons is used to explain the effect ( a finer presentation may be found in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "consider scattering of the meson bound to two nucleons fixed at a separation @xmath53 .",
    "let the amplitudes of the meson at each nucleon be @xmath108 .",
    "the meson bounces off each nucleon and the multiple scattering equations are @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the meson - nucleon scattering matrix and @xmath111 is the propagator for the meson passing from one to the other nucleon @xmath112 one needs to regularize @xmath111 at short ranges but for simplicity of the presentation this is suppressed .",
    "the consistency between the scattering and the bound state requires vanishing of the determinant @xmath113 this condition determines the _ complex _ eigen - momentum @xmath114 which gives the energy and the width of the meson + fixed - nn system .    if the @xmath107n interaction is dominated by a resonance below the threshold , such as @xmath2 , then @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is a coupling constant and @xmath117 is the @xmath2 complex energy .",
    "the solution of eigenvalue equation , @xmath118 , takes the form @xmath119 the solution @xmath120 depends on the n - n separation @xmath121 . since re",
    "@xmath122 close to the resonance is positive , the binding of @xmath107 to fixed two nucleons is stronger than the @xmath107 binding to one nucleon , @xmath123 . increasing the separation",
    "@xmath124 one obtains @xmath125 and @xmath126 ,   i.e. the @xmath107 meson becomes bound to one of the nucleons . in the same limit the lifetime of @xmath107 becomes equal to the lifetime of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the separation energy is understood here as the energy needed to split the @xmath107-n - n system into the @xmath2-n system .",
    "the last term in eq.([a4 ] ) constitutes a potential contracting the two nucleons .",
    "it is very strong and leads to large 50 - 100 mev bindings of the system and the widths in the range of 40 - 80 mev .",
    "the next step in the calculation ( not presented ) is to allow the nucleon degrees of freedom and use these results in a variational procedure .",
    "the decay channel @xmath127 coupled to the basic @xmath107 n channel may be introduced explicitly .",
    "the wave function has two components , one related to the @xmath107 n the other to the @xmath127 channel .",
    "the scattering amplitudes are two dimensional vectors @xmath128 at each nucleon .",
    "now @xmath110 becomes a matrix in two channel indices @xmath129 , where @xmath130 , and below the threshold @xmath131 .",
    "the multiple scattering equations are changed accordingly and the binding energy @xmath132 becomes larger than the binding of the resonance but the collisions in the decay channel induce oscillations .",
    "this oscillatory behavior is also seen in the width of the system @xmath133 -   ( \\gamma_k)^2\\frac{sin(p_rr)}{r}\\exp(-p_ir).\\ ] ] the contribution from multiple scattering in the decay channel is sizable in general but it oscillates and may under some conditions reduce the total width .",
    "that is an effect of interference in the decay channel . in the @xmath107 nn case",
    "the scattering in the decay channel turns out to be constructive and leads to about 25@xmath134 stronger binding and larger widths .",
    "unfortunately , in the @xmath1 meson case this method can not be used as the @xmath3 is located above the @xmath1-n threshold .",
    "the solutions given above exist for n - n distances less than a critical value @xmath135 . in the case of @xmath47he one",
    "has @xmath136fm and the variational method of ref.@xcite seems applicable . in the most interesting @xmath54he case",
    "it is not .",
    "other methods should be tried as the effects might be sizable .",
