    "we emphasize that for integration over the solid angle , we choose a coordinate system in which the momentum of outgoing photon is in the z direction and the @xmath256 momentum is in the x - z plane ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "in this work , we have concentrated on the evaluation of photon circular polarization , @xmath4 , in @xmath0 @xmath1 process and obtaining a new relation , which is useful for extracting five leading independent lecs .",
    "the pv polarization of photon is given by @xmath257 where @xmath258 and @xmath259 are the cross section for the photons with right and left helicity , respectively .",
    "we know that the cross sections are calculated with spin summation on the square amplitude",

    "so , for the photon circular polarization , we have @xmath262 where @xmath263 is calculated numerically and shown in fig.[fig9 ] .",

    "this small variation can be removed with the consideration of the higher order corrections .",
    "therefore , the variation of the @xmath263 indicates the ignorable dependence on cutoff at the leading order .",
    "so , it can be concluded that at lo for pv neutron radiative capture by deuteron no new three - nucleon interaction is needed .    in the numerical calculation for the results shown in [ fig9 ] , we used for the nucleon mass @xmath276 mev , deuteron binding momentum @xmath277 mev , effective range of deuteron @xmath278 fm , effective range of @xmath3 singlet channel @xmath279 fm , scattering length in singlet channel of @xmath280 fm and a triton binding energy @xmath281 mev .",

    "therefore we can compare our estimated result with a theoretical methods such as ddh model .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath4 in @xmath0 @xmath1 based on ddh model are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 for two super - soft - core ( ssc ) and reid - soft - core ( rsc ) potentials , respectively @xcite .",
    "recently , the value of @xmath4 in @xmath0 @xmath1 is calculated with the ddh - best parameter values and 4-parameter fits for the different potential models in ref.@xcite .",
    "the order of magnitude of the results of @xmath4 in the ref.@xcite is the order of @xmath284 .",

    "we have used the pv two - body interaction in our calculation .",
    "no pv three - body interaction is taken into account at the leading order .",
