    "confined polymers play an important role in many industrial processes and biological systems .",
    "examples range from membrane filtration and oil recovery to gel electrophoresis and protein translocation  @xcite .",
    "importantly , recent technological development in nano-/micro - fluidics has made it possible to manipulate and trap biomolecules such as double - stranded ( ds ) dna in confined environments with a characteristic lengthscale that is much smaller than the radius of gyration of the polymers  @xcite .",
    "also under biological conditions , dna is often strongly confined , e.g. packed into a viral capsid  @xcite , bacteria  @xcite or the eukaryotic cell nucleus  @xcite .    in this article , we report molecular dynamics simulations that allow us to determine the typical speed of the segregation of initially mixed polymers in cylindrical confinement .",
    "this problem has particular relevance for the understanding of chromosome segregation in bacteria , where the nature of its underlying mechanism is currently under debate . here , the basic issue is whether the major driving force for segregation of duplicating chromosomes in strong confinement is physical ( driven by entropy or mechanical `` pushing '' )  @xcite or biological ( such as cytoskeletal and motor proteins )  @xcite .",
    "our results show that the effective repulsion between two chains in a cylindrical geometry of confinement can be very strong .",
    "typically , the segregation requires a time proportional to @xmath0 , which is much faster than the @xmath1 timescale of chain diffusion , where @xmath2 is the chain length .",
    "this suggests that for filamentous bacteria such as _ streptomyces coelicolor _",
    "@xcite or cyanobacterium _ anabaena _",
    "@xcite , the main driving force of chromosome segregation might be entropic and any additional mechanisms are for `` optimization . '' as we shall discuss later , our proposal is fully consistent with the recent results that chromosome segregation in some filamentous bacteria is a _ random _ process  @xcite .",
    "the chains consist of @xmath2 beads of size @xmath3 each .",
    "@xmath4 denotes the chain extension , and @xmath5 the distance of the centers of mass . ]",
    "consider two linear chains with excluded - volume interactions , which are initially intermingled and confined in an infinitely long cylinder with a diameter @xmath6 that is much smaller than the radius of gyration @xmath7 of the unconfined chains ( fig .",
    "[ fig : blobs ] ) . as the two chains can gain conformational entropy by demixing",
    ", they effectively repel each other .",
    "note that the free energy cost for simultaneous overlap of @xmath8 chains scales as @xmath9 in the dilute regime and then increases faster as @xmath10 in the more concentrated regime , independent of the chain length  @xcite .",
    "thus , for two intermingling chains illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : blobs ] , each blob - blob overlap contributes @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) to the free - energy cost .",
    "the potential of mean force for segregation between the two chains then is proportional to the total number of overlapping blobs , i.e. , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the equilibrium length of an isolated individual chain in the pore , and @xmath5 the center - to - center distance between the two chains .",
    "the effective repulsive force is then obtained as @xmath15 and , thus , the equation of motion for the center of mass is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the total mass and the effective friction of the chain , respectively ( @xmath19 is the mass of a single monomer ) . ignoring hydrodynamic interactions between monomers , one can assume that the frictions @xmath20 on the individual monomers are additive , i.e. , also @xmath21 . then , the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : eqmotion ] with an initial condition @xmath22 at @xmath23 can be obtained as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the `` inertial '' timescale . in practice , @xmath26 and",
    "hence the characteristic segregation speed is constant and given by @xmath27    the equilibrium length of confined chains , @xmath14 , is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the time for reaching complete segregation , @xmath28 , scales as @xmath29 this is time is much shorter than @xmath30 , the typical time it takes a single chain to diffuse over a distance equal to its own length : @xmath31 however , the above considerations do apply for the initial situation of complete overlap , @xmath32 . in this case",
    "the system is in a state of unstable equilibrium , since the effective segregation force is @xmath33 .",
    "hence , the system will initially show purely diffusive behaviour until a certain separation , typically @xmath34 , is reached .",
    "we refer to the time until segregation sets in as the `` induction time '' @xmath35 that should scale as @xmath1 . with increasing @xmath6 , diffusion becomes easier , because the monomer concentration decreases , and @xmath35 decreases , while @xmath36 increases with @xmath6 .",
    "below , we show that for all practically relevant diameters , the segregation process is rate limiting .    for real bacteria , entropic segregation already sets in during replication .",
    "therefore , segregation always takes place for comparatively short pieces of dna , so that the induction time does not play a role .",
    "in the molecular dynamics simulations , we model the polymers using a bead  spring model in a cylindrical compartment of diameter @xmath6 ; each chain consists of @xmath2 beads of diameter @xmath3 . the bead ",
    "bead and bead  compartment interactions were modeled by a weeks - chandler - andersen potential ( wca )  @xcite , which corresponds to the repulsive part of the lennard - jones potential : @xmath37    \\label{eq : lj}\\ ] ] for @xmath38{2}\\sigma$ ] and 0 elsewhere .",

    "other parameters vary for the different simulation runs , see table  [ tab : simparams ] .",
    "our simulation procedure contains four steps :    the system is initially prepared in a `` ladder '' configuration formed by two interconnected zig ",
    "zag strands , i.e. , the system consists of two linear chains where the @xmath58th bead of one chain is bonded to the @xmath58th bead of the other chain , in addition to the bonds to its neighbors within the same chain .    to equilibrate the system , we simulate for @xmath52 steps with a `` soft '' wca potential , i.e. a wca potential that has been modified such that the potential is linear for distances smaller than a radius @xmath59 .",
    "we reduce @xmath59 gradually during the equilibration phase , so that the potential converges to the plain wca interaction .",
    "this procedure allows more overlap between beads during the initial equilibration phase , which helps the bonds to quickly relax to the equilibrium length .",
    "after the equilibration of the interconnected chains , we remove the interconnecting bonds to obtain two separate chains whose centers of mass very nearly coincide .",
    "the chains are stretched by about @xmath60 compared to a single chain in confinement due to the cross linking ; however , their length relaxes quickly to almost the same length as a single chain once the cross linking is released .",
    "the timescale for this relaxation is negligible compared to the segregation time .",
    "we continue to simulate the system until the two chains have segregated , i.e. , until the chains do not overlap and their centers of mass are separated by at least the equilibrium length @xmath14 of a single chain , which had been determined beforehand by separate simulations . during this run ,",
    "we record configurations every @xmath53 simulation steps .    , @xmath61 , starting from the removal of the interconnecting bonds .",

    "[ fig : segrun ] . for each of these data sets ,",
    "we calculate the distance @xmath63 of the centers of mass of the two chains parallel to the cylindrical compartment as a function of time .",
    "initially , @xmath5 is zero due to the preparation of the system , and stays close to zero during the induction time .",
    "eventually , segregation sets in , and @xmath5 grows rapidly until @xmath28 is reached , at which time the chains do not overlap anymore . further increase in @xmath5",

    "we always find linear segregation behavior for @xmath69 .",

    "the prediction that the segregation time , scales as @xmath0 is only recovered for small tube diameters .",
    "this is not unexpected , because when @xmath6 approaches @xmath14 , the simple blob prediction for @xmath14 breaks down  @xcite and the segregation time levels off at the relaxation of a free chain .",

    "the distribution of the induction times has a long tail , which makes it difficult to sample @xmath35 accurately . keeping this caveat in mind",
    ", we find that for small tube diameters the @xmath35 s computed for different chain lengths can be made to collapse if we assume @xmath1-scaling , as expected for a diffusive process .",
    "moreover , we do observe the expected decrease of @xmath35 with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "for larger tube diameters , the induction time increases again ; this is probably due to the fact that for larger @xmath6 the segregation and induction times can not be clearly separated ( @xmath73 for larger diameters .",
    "in fact , in our simulations , the induction time seems to converge to about one quarter of the segregation time for all @xmath2 and @xmath74 .",
    "we stress that for highly confined chains , the diffusive process is only responsible for the segregation over the tiny initial separation necessary to obtain a significant effective entropic force @xmath75 .",
    "the overwhelming part of the chain `` demixing '' is due to directed segregation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : segrun ] ) .",

    "[ fig : densityseries ] shows the average monomer densities of the two polymers for different center - of - mass distances @xmath5 .",
    "as predicted , the monomer densities of each chain in the overlap region are almost unaffected by the presence of a second polymer in the same space .",
    "hence , the initial monomer density is almost twice as large as for a single chain . during segregation ,",
    "the monomer densities of the individual polymers increase somewhat .",
    "in fact , the snapshots show that the polymers have very nearly separated at @xmath78 , which is significantly less than @xmath80 ; this demonstrates that the polymers deform during segregation : the entropic driving force is strong enough to compress the polymers .",
    "after demixing , the chains expand to their equilibrium length .",
    "our simulations support the scaling prediction that the entropically driven segregation of two confined chains requires a time proportional to @xmath0 . for long chains ,",
    "this time is much shorter than the diffusive time that scales as @xmath1 .",
    "we stress that this speed up of entropically driven segregation does not involve any active ( energy - consuming ) process .",
    "considering the geometry of confinement and the length scales of ( filamenteous ) bacteria , our results strongly suggest that the partitioning of duplicated chromosomes in these organisms is , at least partly , entropy - driven .",
    "since the segregation sets already in during replication , there is no initial `` induction '' regime for bacteria .",

    "pcc 7120 suggests that mreb , a bacterial actin homologue that is speculated by some as a `` track '' for transporting chromosome by putative motor proteins , is important for cell shape but not for chromosome segregation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they also have shown that the ratios of dna content in two daughter cells have a much wider distribution than in the case that the two cells were identical .",
    "this suggests that chromosome partitioning is a random process , in good agreement with our entropy - driven segregation process we presented in this article .",
