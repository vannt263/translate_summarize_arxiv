    "density functional theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ( dft ) is by now the most popular method for electronic structure calculations in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry , because of its unique combination of low computational cost and reasonable accuracy for many molecules and solids .",
    "however , despite its large success in scientific areas ranging from material science to biology , several basic issues in dft are still unsolved , and hamper futher developments towards high accuracy . besides , some of these issues are often ovelooked or simply ignored .",
    "we believe that raising them is a necessary step towards further improvement of dft performances . to this purpose , in this paper we concentrate on a critical issue in this regard , namely the problem of size consistency in dft in the presence of degeneracy .",
    "the hohenberg - kohn theorems @xcite and the kohn - sham method @xcite provide a firm basis for dft calculations , in which the ground state energy and density of a many - electron system is obtained by using energy density functionals that can be rigorously defined .",
    "unfortunately , the exact definition does not give a prescription that can be followed in practice .",
    "approximations are needed for the exchange - correlation energy @xmath0 $ ] as a functional of the electronic density @xmath1 , together with the corresponding exchange - correlation part of the kohn - sham potential , i.e. , the functional derivative of @xmath0 $ ] with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth stressing that none of the available approximate @xmath0 $ ] satisfies two basic requirements :    * to provide reasonable error estimates ; * to allow systematic improvement , meaning that one knows how to reduce the errors by means of a well defined procedure .",
    "moreover , size consistency in dft , which is often taken for granted ( at least for systems composed of closed - shell fragments ) can still be an issue , as discussed in the following sections .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec_nintensive ] discusses the general form of many approximate energy density functionals , focusing on the size consistency problem in the hohenberg - kohn framework . a similar analysis within the kohn - sham theory",
    "is then carried out in sec .",
    "[ sec_ks ] .",
    "systems with fractional electron number are discussed from the same point of view in sec .",
    "[ sec_frac ] . the last sec .",
    "[ sec_conclusions ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "the hohenberg - kohn theorems @xcite state that the energy of a many - electron system is a variational functional of the density , @xmath2 $ ] , given by the sum of a universal part , @xmath3 $ ] , and a linear functional determined by the external potential @xmath4 acting on the electrons , e[n]=f[n]+d v_ne ( ) n ( ) . [ eq_etot ] although the great success of dft comes essentially from the introduction of the kohn - sham kinetic energy functional , orbital - free dft is appealing for its lower computational cost , and is nowadays an active field of research ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus worth to first analyze the size - consistency issue in the pure hohenberg - kohn framework . in orbital - free dft",
    "the universal functional @xmath3 $ ] of eq .",
    "( [ eq_etot ] ) is rewritten as f[n]=e_kxc[n]+e_h[n ] , [ eq_ekxc ] where @xmath5 $ ] is the usual hartree classical repulsion energy , @xmath5=\\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\rv\\int d\\rv ' n(\\rv ) n(\\rv')|\\rv-\\rv'|^{-1}$ ] , and @xmath6 $ ] is the remaining part of the energy , the kinetic and exchange correlation functional , that needs to be approximated .",
    "the simplest approximations to @xmath6 $ ] have the form e_kxc^appr[n]=df(n(),|n()| , ... ) , [ eq_apprgeneral ] where the function @xmath7 is chosen to yield accurate properties for selected systems , e.g. , the energy of the uniform electron gas , and/or to satisfy some known exact constraints , like scaling relations .",
    "the requirement of size consistency for a quantum chemistry method is that the result for the energy @xmath8 of two non - interacting systems @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( e.g. , which are at infinite distance from each other ) be equal to the sum of their individual energies , @xmath11 .",
    "size consistency is evidently crucial when computing dissociation energies .    when approximations of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq_apprgeneral ] ) are used , one is tempted to believe that size - consistency is guaranteed if the function @xmath7 is intensive , i.e. , if its value in the domain of space pertaining to system @xmath9 , @xmath12 , is not changed by the presence of the system @xmath10 very far from @xmath9 .",
    "a corresponding statement can be made for the integration @xmath13 over the region of system @xmath10 . as the integral in the composite system is the sum over the regions of the individual ( sub-)systems , df(n(),|n()|, ...",
    ")=__a df(n(),|n()|, ... )+ _ _ b df(n(),|n()| , ... ) size consistency would be guaranteed ( for the hartree and the external potential terms the same partition obviously holds for non - interacting subsystems ) .",
    "the basic belief behind this statement is that the density itself be an intensive quantity , i.e. , that the total density @xmath14 of the composite system @xmath15 be equal to n_a+b()=\\ {    lr n_a ( ) & _ a + n_b ( ) & _ b    .",
    "[ eq_nintensive ] however , this is not true when one of the two systems ( or both ) has a degenerate ground state with different densities . in this case",
    ", even an infinitesimal interaction with the other system can select one of the states ( or a specific ensemble of some of the degenerate states ) .",
    "this change is not infinitesimal , and depends on the nature of the other system .",
    "simple examples are diatomic molecules in which the individual atoms have partially filled shells with @xmath16 ( e.g. b@xmath17 , c@xmath17 , ... ) .",
    "an even simpler example is one of such atoms ( with degenerate non - spherical densities ) perturbed by a proton placed at a large distance .",
    "thus , for degenerate systems , eq .",

    "equation ( [ eq_nnonintensive ] ) shows the non intensive character of the density in the presence of degeneracy .",
    "the _ exact _",
    "@xmath3 $ ] , of course , would preserve the degeneracy so that it would give for any linear combination of the degenerate densities , say , @xmath18 the same energy for the system @xmath9 , leading to size consistency .",
    "but none of the available approximate functionals is able to preserve the degeneracy of the physical system , as none is invariant within the set of degenerate densities .",
    "typically , when treating the isolated systems with an approximate functional , one obtains a lower energy with one of the degenerate densities , or for a particular ensemble .",
    "this means that the approximation is size consistent only for some very specific choices of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , not in general .",
    "notice that here we consider the simple case in which different degenerate wavefunctions yield different densities . the interesting case of different denegerate wavefunctions corresponding to the same density is deeply analyzed in @xcite .",

    "@xmath25 $ ] can have different values for different densities @xmath31 that are degenerate in the physical system .",
    "the work of fertig and kohn @xcite clearly shows that to different degenerate @xmath31 can correspond different kohn - sham potentials @xmath32 .",
    "for example , in an open shell atom with several degenerate non - spherical densities we have different non - spherical kohn - sham potentials , one for each symmetry . and for an ensemble of these densities , we usually need yet another kohn - sham potential @xcite .",

    "@xcite , imposing eq .",

    "all quantities are exact , calculated from the analytical solutions given by taut @xcite , and are reported in hartree atomic units . ]",
    "fractional number of electrons can be recast in the same class of problems ( degeneracy and size - consistency ) discussed in the previous sections ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to understand why ,",
    "consider the simple example of the stretched he@xmath50 molecule , where now system @xmath9 is the he nucleus plus its electronic cloud on the left , and system @xmath10 is the one on the right .",
