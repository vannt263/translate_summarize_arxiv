    "there are three approaches to determining the neutrino mass scale : through the measurement of the electron energies near the endpoint of a beta - decay spectrum , measurement of the half - life in a neutrino - less double beta - decay ( if neutrinos are majorana particles ) , and via study of cosmological data ; see ref .",

    "beam - related backgrounds can be measured by adjusting the ion s momentum so that @xmath158 and no electrons should have a backward trajectory , while the beam - unrelated background can be determined from beam - off periods .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fi : systematics ] , we present the sensitivity as a function of the spread of the ion momentum in the beam direction .",
    "we assume a gaussian momentum distribution in the beam direction with width @xmath141 . from eq .",
    "[ eq : dp ] , this translates into a spread on @xmath90 of @xmath159 in order to include this uncertainty in the analysis we fold the number of events @xmath160 , given in eq .",
    "[ e : flux ] , with a gaussian with width @xmath161 .",
    "this procedure takes into account the momentum spread parallel to the beam , whereas the momentum uncertainty perpendicular to the beam is not included",
    ". this will be important in reality , especially in a setup that uses the radial distribution of electrons .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fi : systematics ] one can see that for the low sensitivity setup , the sensitivity to the neutrino mass starts to abate at @xmath162 .",
    "this is consistent with the relation between the uncertainty on the electron energy and the ion momentum spread : @xmath163 \\,.\\ ] ] for @xmath164  ev and @xmath131  kev , one requires an uncertainty on the momentum to be @xmath165 for @xmath166 . the same estimate for the high sensitivity setup predicts @xmath167  ev for @xmath168 .",
    "however , from fig .",
    "[ fi : systematics ] we observe that the sensitivity starts to deteriorate only at @xmath169 where , according to eq .",
    "[ e : uncert ] , @xmath170  ev . this behaviour indicates that the higher count rates can compensate for less precision on the ion beam momentum . in summary , to reach interesting sensitivities to the neutrino mass , momentum spreads in the range @xmath29 to @xmath114 are required .",
    "our analysis indicates that we would require @xmath171 useful decays to reach sub - katrin sensitivities .",
    "such production is in line with projected eurisol intensities  @xcite .",
    "however , to store such a large number of ions is a major challenge , especially as they will be long lived and possibly have high charge .",
    "space charge effects , the defocussing of the beam due to beam - particle interactions , will be significant at non - relativistic velocities .",
    "the mass measurements discussed in this paper can only be realized if the energy spread of the ions in the ring is very small . for an electron with kinetic energy @xmath38 ,",
    "an uncertainty on the ion momentum @xmath172 translates to an uncertainty on the electron energy via eq .",
    "[ e : uncert ] .",
    "for example , an endpoint electron from an ion with @xmath131  kev , an uncertainty on its kinetic energy of 0.1  ev requires @xmath173 .",
    "the numerical results presented in section  [ sec : requirements ] indicate that in order to reach interesting sensitivities to the neutrino mass , ion momentum spreads in the range @xmath29 to @xmath114 are required .",
    "values in this range may be achieved with classical beam cooling for low energy ion beams with electron cooling or laser cooling .",
    "therefore , if ions with very low @xmath2-values ( @xmath174 ) are available , classical cooling is sufficient .",
    "availability of such low @xmath2-values in nature is minimal , however , those that do exist are not practical .",
    "for example , @xmath71re has @xmath175  kev , but it also has a half - life of @xmath176 years .",
    "new coolings techniques will be required for the likely much larger @xmath2-values .    for cooled low intensity ion beams of @xmath177 ions , a distinct transition to much lower momentum spread has been observed with increasing electron cooling current at nap - m in novosibirsk  @xcite , esr at gsi  @xcite and cryring at msl  @xcite .",
    "this has been interpreted as an ordering of the ions in a regime where the energy spread of the beam is too small to permit any individual ion to overtake or drop behind its neighbors .",
    "effectively , the ions will create a one dimensional string of ions with a minimum distance separating individual ions .",
    "this distance is defined classically by setting kinetic and potential energy equal , giving @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the ion temperature @xcite .",
    "the momentum spread is measured to be smaller than @xmath180 with the upper limit given by the known ripple of the power supplies controlling the electromagnetic fields which confine the beam .",
    "the ultimate momentum spread is set by the cooling forces acting on the beam .",
    "first studies have shown that bunching of ordered beam should be possible enabling at least moderate acceleration @xcite . to create much higher",
    "energy ordered beams it is necessary to develop cooling schemes for highly relativistic beams as the ordered beam bunch is unlikely to survive transition .",
    "development of electron cooling schemes for ultra relativistic ion beams are underway at bnl  @xcite , for example .",
    "the new he - storage rings at the fair facility in germany will in time enable experiments with laser cooling of highly relativistic beams  @xcite .",
    "for the low energy regime , experimental work is in progress in japan at the s - lsr ring in kyoto @xcite .",
    "they have demonstrated one dimensional ordering of protons @xcite and are working on special tapered cooling schemes in a dispersion free storage ring for experiments aiming to achieve three dimensional ordering of highly charged ions .",
    "potential new applications such as the one proposed in this paper could motivate r&d on ordered beams . such efforts could eventually yield higher intensity and/or higher energy ordered beams .",
    "studies are needed on increasing the number of ions , and ensuring the desired properties of the beam at high densities .",
    "all experiments on crystallized beams carried out thus far @xcite have used less than 10000 ions .      in this paper , we have established the necessity of @xmath117 decays and @xmath2-values @xmath181  kev if accelerated ions are to be used to measure the neutrino mass at sub - katrin levels .",
    "this measurement therefore needs a low @xmath2-value ion with a short half - life .",
    "rhenium-187 possesses the smallest @xmath2-value known : 2.6 kev ; however , the @xmath182 transition has a half - life of @xmath176  y. for the set of beta emitting nuclei with half - lives @xmath183  y , ruthenium-106 and radium-228 have the smallest @xmath2-values : 39.4  kev and 45.9  kev , respectively .",
    "the total number of decays will need to be increased by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude to match the sensitivities discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : requirements ] if these ions were to be used .",
    "the most promising ion is therefore tritium with @xmath184  kev , however electron cooling is necessary rather than laser cooling because it has no hyperfine structure when ionized .",
    "tritium has the added advantage that the number of ions that can be obtained is orders of magnitude larger than those discussed in this paper , as it is naturally occurring and does not need to be produced in an accelerator .",
    "we have discussed the possibility to use radioactive ion beams to study the kinematic effects of a non - zero neutrino mass close to the endpoint of the beta decay spectrum .",
    "the underlying idea is to adjust the boost factor of the ions in such a way that only electrons close to the endpoint will have backward trajectories in the laboratory frame .",
    "we have discussed some requirements of the proposed setup in order to exceed the sensitivity of 0.2  ev of the latest generation of tritium and rhenium decay experiments .",
    "a crucial question is whether it will be possible to accelerate enough ions within reasonable time such that of order @xmath171 decays can be observed .",
    "this issue is also related to the identification of a suitable ion with a low enough @xmath2-value ( in order to maximize the effect of the neutrino mass ) , and a small enough half life ( in order to have a high enough decay rate ) .    as an example , for a very low @xmath2-value of 2  kev , one needs @xmath185 decays to obtain the katrin sensitivity of 0.2  ev , while @xmath153 decays will allow for a @xmath18 measurement at 0.04  ev . on the other hand ,",
    "if no suitable ion with such a low @xmath2-value can be identified the requirements on the total number of decays increases drastically : for @xmath186  kev the 0.2  ev sensitivity is reached for @xmath187 ( @xmath151 ) decays , respectively .",
    "the sensitivity goal of @xmath188  ev , which will separate the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy regions , requires in excess of @xmath153 counts across the run of the experiment together with a @xmath2-value of 2  kev .",
    "our proposal relies on a very small momentum spread of the ions , at the level of @xmath189 .",
    "momentum spreads in the range @xmath114 to @xmath29 may be reached by classical beam cooling techniques such as electron or laser cooling . for even smaller",
    "momentum spreads one may explore the use of `` crystallized beams ''  @xcite .",
    "this is a phenomenon which has been observed for cooled low intensity ion beams , resulting in a transition to an ordered state of the beam with momentum spreads of less than @xmath180 .",
    "it has yet to be proven whether this technique allows for the extremely high beam intensities required for the neutrino mass measurement proposed here .",
    "in addition one needs to separate forward and backward moving electrons with an precision of order @xmath190 . in general forward moving electrons",
    "will create backward moving electrons by collisions with the walls of the cavern . a suitable experimental configuration to overcome this challenge must be identified .",
    "given the utmost importance of establishing the absolute value of the neutrino mass in a model independent way , we feel that all possible directions have to be explored .",
    "we hope that our work will stimulate more intense investigations on the possibility to use ion beams to pursue this fundamental issue in neutrino physics .",

    "consider an electron with charge @xmath191 and momentum @xmath154 perpendicular to a magnetic field @xmath104 , which is parallel to the beam axis .",

    "unfortunately the shape of this distribution carries only limited information on the neutrino mass .",

    "note that the electrons with @xmath204 , which have the maximal momentum @xmath83 , will hit the wall at all radii from zero to @xmath201 .",
    "hence , for small @xmath108 electrons with rather broad range of momenta contribute . because of this the @xmath108 distribution provides only limited additional information , beyond just the decrease of event number with increasing @xmath135 .",
