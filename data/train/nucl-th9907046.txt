    "the various kinds of flow phenomena such as directed flow , elliptic flow and radial flow have been observed in recent experiment at ags and sps @xcite-@xcite .",
    "anisotropic flow phenomena are expected to show a strong dependence on the nuclear equation of state @xcite . here , for",
    "analyzing anisotropic flow phenomena with relativistic hydrodynamical model in detail , we need _ full _ calculation of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical equation . our purpose is analysis of collective flow based on ( 3 + 1)-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical model with realistic initial conditions .",
    "r55 mm    our calculational procedure is explained briefly . to begin with , we calculate initial conditions for the relativistic hydrodynamical model by using the event generator , urasima ( ultra - relativistic a - a collision simulator based on multiple scattering algorithm ) which is characterized by multi chain model @xcite .",
    "we focus on ags energy region and several incident energies such as 5 , 10.8 , 20 agev for au+au collisions in which impact parameter is fixed to 6 fm @xcite .",
    "we characterize time @xmath0 when the projectile nuclei finishes passing through the target nuclei and hydrodynamical evolution starts .",
    "energy density and baryon density from urasima is transformed into temperature and chemical potential with the equation of state of the ideal hadron gas . here",
    ", so as to solve the relativistic hydrodynamical equation easily we smooth the results keeping condition that the difference between original results and smoothed results is less than 1 % .",
    "we numerically solve fully ( 3 + 1)-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical equation coupled with the baryon number conservation law using lagrangian hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the equation of state is needed to solve the hydrodynamical equation and anisotropic flow is evaluated in detail by inputting the different equation of state to the hydrodynamical equation . here , for the first trial we use the equation of state of the ideal hadron gas which contains resonance up to 2 gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the hadronization process occurs when the temperature and chemical potential of the volume elements cross the boundary ( solid line in fig.1 ) .",
    "the solid line is so designed that the freeze - out temperature becomes 140 mev at vanishing chemical potential , based on chemical freeze - out model and thermal freeze - out model @xcite .",
    "finally , we investigate azimuthal distribution of proton by using cooper - frye formula @xcite for particle emission from hadronic fluid .",
    "@xmath1 [ fm / c ]    @xmath2 [ fm / c ]    @xmath3 [ fm / c ]    figure 2 displays that the evolution of temperature distribution and chemical potential distribution at @xmath4 fm in au+au 10.8 agev collision .",
    "the graphs at @xmath5 fm / c show initial conditions from urasima and from initial time hydrodynamical expansion starts .",
    "we can see that both temperature distribution and chemical potential distribution expand in the transverse direction .",
    "the temperature distribution decreases with time , on the other hand chemical potential distribution increases with time .",
    "this is because baryon number density localize and the average of mass of baryons is larger than 1gev .",
    "the fluctuations which we can see in initial chemical potential distribution descend with time .",
    "freeze - out hypersurface which is assumed in previous section is illustrated with temperature distribution in fig.2 .",
    "the life time and size of fluid depends on the hydrodynamical expansion and freeze - out conditions .",
    "the size of fluid can be estimated roughly to be about @xmath6 fm at @xmath2 fm / c from fig .",

    "though only small transverse flow exists at initial time , it increases with time and the growth of transverse flow depends on initial temperature distribution and chemical distribution .",

    "we obtain several results at ags energy region . as a result of our freeze - out conditions ,",
    "the life time of fluid is comparatively long and the size of fluid which is estimated roughly is larger than experimental result which is obtained by analysis based on hbt @xcite . by comparing physical properties on the @xmath17 hypersurface to ones on the freeze - out hypersurface , the decrease of energy density reflects on the growth of local velocity .",
