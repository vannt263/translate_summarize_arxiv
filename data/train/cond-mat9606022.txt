    "x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) in a magnetic sample is the difference between absorption spectra obtained from right- and left - circularly polarized x - rays . this experimental technique was discovered in 1987 , @xcite and gives information on the magnetic contribution of each orbital and of each atomic species in a sample .",
    "still now , the detailed mechanisms that give rise to xmcd at the k - edge are not entirely clear near the edge and are unknown far from it .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to understand xmcd at the k - edge over the whole energy range used in experiments .",
    "our main tool is a new semi - relativistic equation which is very useful from a computational point of view , and which can be used to calculate other relativistic properties , such as magnetic anisotropy .    in a previous paper",
    ", we described a preliminary approach to the calculation of the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism effect in x - ray absorption spectroscopy , within the framework of the multiple - scattering theory .",
    "@xcite we assumed that xmcd at the l@xmath1-edges of rare earths and @xmath2 transition metals has a simple interpretation and that xmcd at the k - edge was the most difficult case , because spin - orbit acts on the photoelectron , which makes a physical picture difficult to build .",
    "> from the experience that was gained in the intervening years , @xcite we know now that the l@xmath1-edges of rare earths are more complicated than expected , and some progress has been made towards a reliable practical use of the experimental results @xcite at the k - edge of transition metals .",
    "although fully relativistic calculations of xmcd at the k - edge are numerous , we believe that the use of a semi - relativistic approach is still justified .",
    "its main advantage is that spin and space variables are uncoupled at the zeroth order .",
    "this enables us to use the full local cluster symmetry , to build a clearer physical picture , and to make orientation averages .",
    "the smaller scattering - matrix dimension of the semi - relativistic approach allows for the calculation of bigger clusters and broader energy ranges .",
    "finally , the existing multiple - scattering numerical programs can be easily extended to calculate the xmcd .",
    "for instance , ankudinov and rehr have adapted their feff program @xcite to calculate the extended structure in xmcd at the l@xmath1-edge of rare earths and 5d transition metals .",
    "they obtained good agreement for gadolinium .",
    "a similar adaptation is possible , although more complex , for k - edge spectra .",
    "here we report on the calculation of the k - absorption spectra and the xmcd of fe in the presence and absence of a static core hole in the 1@xmath3 state .",
    "the influence of the core hole was taken into account by the final - state rule which assumes that the final state energies of the x - ray absorption process are measured in the presence of a static core hole , i.e. , the dynamics of the excitation process are neglected .",
    "@xcite this rule has been used with success to explain the satellite structures on the high energy side of the emission spectra of simple metals .",
    "@xcite in particular , for na and al the l@xmath1 emission satellites on the high - energy side of the main lines due to the double ionization of the 2@xmath4 core level is well reproduced by the calculations if the excited atom is treated as an impurity and the static electron - hole interaction is included in the calculation .",
    "@xcite the final state rule was also used to calculate the l@xmath5-edge of 3@xmath6 transition metal ferromagnetics , @xcite and the effect of the core hole is found to be very important .",
    "the determination of the self - consistent potentials is carried out within the local density approximation with a linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) basis - set .",
    "@xcite we use a supercell geometry and treat the excited atom with a core hole as a single impurity atom in a lattice .",
    "a 1@xmath3 electron is added to the conduction states in the supercell , and we let the system of n+1 electrons relax selfconsistently .",
    "we have found that the photo - electron localizes on the excited atom providing an efficient screening of the core hole . like the case of l@xmath1",
    "edge@xcite up to 80% of the photoelectron polarizes as a minority spin .",
    "thus , the electronic structure of the excited fe atom is very close to that of a cobalt metal .",
    "however , in this calculation we have found that the effect of the core hole on the k - absorption edge and the xmcd is small , and this is because the @xmath4-states of fe are less affected by the presence of the core hole .    in this paper , the determination of the absorption spectra and the xmcd is carried out within the multiple scattering theory . during the implementation of our early formalism we encountered several difficulties that convinced us that the naive approach used in ref .   to take spin - orbit effect into account",
    "is mathematically not sound . in the present paper ,",
    "we use a different mathematical framework for the calculation of xmcd , that can be generalized to take relativistic effects in the valence @xmath6-shell for l@xmath1-edges .",
    "this approach gives a direct expansion of the dirac green function in powers of @xmath7 , it overcomes the divergence of the foldy - wouthuysen transformation through the use of complex energies , and it leads to results in reasonable agreement with experiment .    some of our results are useful only for x - ray absorption spectroscopy , but others can have wider applications , such as the convergence of the semi - relativistic limit and the properties of the green function at complex energies .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we point out the limitation of the foldy - wouthuysen transformation and give a new method for the determination of the relativistic effects within the green function approach .",
    "we then apply the green function framework to the calculation of the xmcd signal . in a third section",
    "the use of complex energies is discussed , and a complex plane integration is used to take the fermi energy into account . in the fourth section we present the numerical implementation that we used , and give the new xmcd cross - section formula at the k - edge .",
    "finally , we present a calculation that was carried out on a reasonably large fe cluster of 259 atoms near the edge and a cluster of 51 atoms up to 500  ev .",
    "good agreement with experiment is found in the high - energy region .",
    "various issues , such as the influence of the relativistic core hole , the origin of xmcd at the edge and far from it , the possibility of a multiple - scattering expansion are discussed .",
    "the spectra are related to the density of states through a simple rule , and the rigid - band model is found to be correct at high energy .",
    "an appendix showing how symmetrized bases were used to calculate xmcd faster and to understand some aspects of the experimental spectra closes the paper .",
    "the relativistic corrections to physical phenomena are usually treated using a perturbation approach developed in 1950 by foldy and wouthuysen ( fw ) , @xcite who made a unitary transformation to eliminate the coupling of the large small components from the dirac equation and obtained , to zeroth order , the pauli hamiltonian and , to first order in ( @xmath8 ) , the spin - orbit , darwin and kinetic energy corrections .",
    "later , this hamiltonian was taken as a starting point for the calculation of many physical properties , such as magnetic anisotropy , xmcd or magneto - optic effects .",
    "sometimes , the spin - orbit term is used in a second - order perturbation theory , overlooking that the fw - transformation must then also be made up to second order ( @xmath9 ) to achieve formal consistency .",
    "however , when carrying out higher - order transformations , strongly divergent terms are found even for the simple case of a hydrogen atom : @xcite the second order `` correction '' is a sum of infinite terms .",
    "additional information concerning the convergence properties of the fw - transformation can be found in ref .  .",
    "even at the @xmath8 order , the behavior of the hamiltonian obtained by adding the kinetic energy correction to the non - relativistic hamiltonian is so bad that all negative eigenvalues ( bound states ) disappear , and a continuum of states is obtained between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , however small @xmath0 may be .",
    "@xcite in some cases , @xcite only the spin - orbit interaction is added to the non - relativistic hamiltonian . for a coulomb potential ,",
    "the negative spin - orbit term pulls the particle into the singularity and the resulting hamiltonian is not essentially self - adjoint ( it can have any eigenvalue , depending on the chosen self - adjoint extension ) .",
    "@xcite physically reasonable results could be obtained by choosing the boundary condition where the wave function is zero at @xmath12 but this process is mathematically ambiguous .",
    "@xcite    to summarize , the series obtained from the fw - transformation exhibits three kinds of divergence : ( i ) the series itself diverges , which is usually not a problem since most perturbation series used in quantum mechanics are divergent ( e.g. zeeman effect , stark effect , anharmonic oscillator ) ;",
    "@xcite ( ii ) from the second order term ( @xmath9 ) , each term of the series is a sum of infinite terms that should add to a finite term , but no procedure is known to carry out this summation;@xcite ( iii ) the first order term of the series ( spin - orbit coupling ) diverges as the cluster size increases .",
    "recently , all these problems of the semi - relativistic limit were solved using modern mathematical methods , and we propose to use this new formulation for the calculation of xmcd .",
    "other approaches to the semi - relativistic limit of the dirac equation were proposed by quantum chemists .",
    "@xcite      the standard method to calculate relativistic effects within the green function approach is to consider the spin - orbit and other terms as a perturbation of the hamiltonian , and to use the lippmann - schwinger equation corresponding to that perturbation .",
    "@xcite this procedure is not mathematically safe and leads to divergences .",
    "another approach to xmcd was proposed by natoli @xcite where the schrdinger equation including spin - orbit was solved for each muffin - tin sphere .    here , we start from the retarded green function @xmath14 corresponding to the dirac hamiltonian with potential @xmath15 ( the dirac green function ) and we use a slight modification of the analytic @xmath16 expansion of @xmath14 that was obtained in ref .",

    "@xmath15 is generally a 2x2 matrix that describes the potential experienced by the electrons with up and down spins . in the simplest case",
    ", @xmath15 is a diagonal matrix made up of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the successive terms of the relativistic expansion are obtained by the series @xmath24}^{-1}=1+t(z)+t^2(z)+\\cdots$ ] .",
    "this expansion gives a very compact formulation of the correction terms .",
    "for instance , the first order correction to a non - degenerate bound - state eigenvalue @xmath25 corresponding to the eigenstate @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 @xcite which contains the kinetic energy correction , the darwin correction and the spin - orbit correction .",
    "because of this simplicity , formal manipulation can be carried out much further , for instance to obtain a consistent second order expansion of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "another aspect of this expansion is that the small components are not eliminated , which will be useful for x - ray absorption spectroscopy .",
    "it was shown that expansion ( [ nrexp ] ) is analytic , @xcite but its actual radius of convergence was investigated only recently .",
    "preliminary results@xcite for the dirac green function without potential showed that the radius of convergence was a function of the imaginary part of the energy .",
    "for a dirac equation with potential , the green function expansion could be shown @xcite to be convergent only when the imaginary part of the energy is greater than @xmath28 ( a very bad resolution indeed ) .",
    "however , the convergence can be much better when a physical property is calculated instead of the general green function .",
    "for instance , the convergence of the bound state energy expansion is fast .",
    "@xcite physically , the idea that can be drawn from these mathematical results is that the use of complex energies makes the semi - relativistic expansion converge , whereas it diverges on the real axis .",
    "this idea will be detailed in the next section .",
    "> from the formal point of view fully relativistic programs require a coupling of an infinity of different @xmath29 values due to the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite up to now , the coupling between @xmath29 and @xmath30 was neglected , which limits the maximum possible value of @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite in our approach , this coupling is made consistently with @xmath16 through the expansion process .      in x - ray absorption spectroscopy",
    ", the spin - orbit parameter for the core hole has a magnitude of several hundreds of ev and can not be considered _ a priori _ small .",
    "furthermore , relativistic effects in x - ray absorption have been shown to be considerable both theoretically @xcite and experimentally .",
    "@xcite therefore , a fully relativistic core hole wave function must be used .",
    "this is not possible within the standard semi - relativistic approach . in the electric dipole approximation ,",
    "the relativistic formula for the x - ray absorption cross - section is : @xmath31     ( \\hat\\epsilon.{\\bf r}')|i\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the energy of the core level @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the x - ray polarisation vector .",
    "the calculation of the fully relativistic initial state @xmath34 presents no difficulty , thanks to the availability of desclaux program .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    "we supposed that the relativistic effects on the valence and continuum states are weak .",
    "we show in the present section that this supposition is not always true .",
    "the influence of relativistic effects on the photoelectron is obtained by the series expansion of the dirac green function . the dirac green function in eq.([nrexp ] ) is expanded up to second order in @xmath16 : @xcite    @xmath36    where the two - component spinors @xmath37 and @xmath26 are the large and small components of the dirac spinor @xmath34 . in our previous approach @xcite we have neglected the relativistic nature of the core state , and used only the spin - orbit interaction , as a consequence we had obtained only the first and a part of the fourth term . formula ( [ nonrelexp ] ) is valid for a non - muffin - tin potential ; the use of non - muffin - tin potentials is probably required to achieve a quantitative estimate of xmcd . in all the terms of eq .",
    "( [ nonrelexp ] ) only the fourth term yields magnetic circular dichroism for a powder sample .",
    "therefore , in the following , we call @xmath38 the spectrum obtained from the first term ,    @xmath39     ( \\hat\\epsilon.{\\bf r}')|\\phi^s\\rangle\\ ] ]    where the sum over @xmath3 is the sum over initial states ( two spin states for a k - edge ) . for a powder ,",

    "more precisely , we have in the fourth term : @xcite @xmath43.\\ ] ] in the right - hand side of the above equation , only the third term contributes to xmcd at the k - edge , because the first two terms do not connect space and spin variables . in the case of spherical potentials ,",
    "one obtains the usual formula for the spin - orbit interaction : @xcite @xmath44 we took this formula for convenience , to make contact with ref .  , but it is also possible to act with @xmath45 and @xmath46 directly on the green function",
    ". this would be much simpler if all relativistic effects ( and not only xmcd ) were investigated .",
    "@xcite in principle , @xmath47 contributes also to the normal absorption spectrum , but this relativistic contribution was assumed to be small as compared to @xmath38 .    finally , to obtain the influence of all sites",
    ", the potential @xmath15 must be written as a sum over all sites plus an interstitial potential . because the operator @xmath45 is translation invariant",
    ", each site can be taken as the origin when making transformation ( [ soeq ] ) . in the muffin - tin case",
    ", it can be shown that the interstitial region does not contribute to xmcd .    for real energies ,",
    "xmcd calculated within the present approach is formally identical with the results of ref .  .",
    "therefore , we can use the latter to understand the real energy behavior of the former . for small clusters ,",
    "the calculation of xmcd was easy , @xcite but as the cluster size increased , we met difficulties .",
    "[ febccei0 ] shows @xmath38 and @xmath48 for a cluster of 259 atoms of bcc - fe .",
    "both spectra exhibit a very sharp resonance ( width @xmath49 0.005  ev ) .",
    "this resonance is due to the fact that , as the cluster size increases , one comes close to the singularities of the crystal scattering matrix .",
    "@xcite the second point is that @xmath48 is larger than @xmath38 .",
    "this unphysical result proves that the spin - orbit effect is not a small perturbation of the system in that energy range .",
    "this illustrates the fact , discussed in the previous section , that the relativistic expansion is generally not convergent at real energies .",
    "it may be worthwhile noticing that this divergence of the relativistic expansion is not due to the @xmath50 singularity of the spin - orbit interaction in a coulomb potential .    moreover , the experimental resolution at the k - edge of transition metals is of the order of 1  ev whereas fig .",
    "[ febccei0 ] shows much sharper structure .",
    "therefore , the usual method of convoluting the theoretical spectrum with a lorentzian profile for comparison with experiment would mean calculating much more points than actually needed .    for real potentials ,",
    "the singularities of the multiple - scattering matrix are on the real axis , and the use of a complex energy smoothes the sharp structure of @xmath38 linked with the cluster size .",
    "we show in the next section that the convergence problem of the relativistic expansion is also solved by calculating the green function at complex energies .    finally , we work within a real space multiple - scattering approach , so that the cluster is assumed to be of finite size .",
    "the relativistic expansion of the green function for an infinite crystal was studied in ref .  .",
    "in this section , we justify the use of complex energies , and we show how this simplifies the calculation of physical quantities .",
    "we assume that the potential @xmath15 is a diagonal 2x2 matrix made up of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are the potentials experienced by up and down spins .",
    "these potentials are assumed to be real .",
    "the generalization to complex potentials is a non - trivial task,@xcite and the use of an energy - dependent width @xmath51 , which can be considered to be the imaginary part of the potential ( constant over space ) , was found to be sufficient to reproduce experimental spectra .",

    "this is related to the weak ferromagnetic nature of bcc - fe , @xcite and was already observed on a smaller cluster @xcite and in tight - binding calculations . @xcite both absorption and xmcd calculated structures are too large from 20  ev above the edge .",
    "this reduction , which is very common in multiple - scattering calculations , is probably due to photoelectrons that experience inelastic interaction with the metal .",
    "this inelastic effect comes into play above the plasmon energy ( about 10  ev ) and can be included in our calculation through an energy - dependent @xmath55.@xcite the main failure of the xmcd calculation is the presence of a large second positive peak which is absent in the experiment .",

    "comparison with experiment does not enable us do decide for a model .",
    "in xmcd at the k - edge , spin - orbit acts directly on the photoelectron , and it is interesting to know whether the high - energy part of the spectrum is related to the spin polarization of the @xmath4-states of the absorbing site . using the methods developed in ref .  , it is possible to show that , in the single scattering approximation , only the @xmath4-projected term @xmath174 survives at high energy . figure  [ exafs](b ) shows the spectrum obtained with a cluster of 51 atoms , calculating all angular momenta up to @xmath137=8 , and multiplied by 1/3 .",
    "the cluster is too small to be realistic in the edge region , but above 30  ev , the overall agreement is correct .",
    "the peak at 110  ev in the theoretical spectrum should be broadened , and the peak at 60  ev in the experimental spectrum is probably due to multielectronic effects , which are known to be strong in xmcd spectra at that energy .",
    "@xcite the thin line represents the contribution of the @xmath4-projected states , which is seen to be dominant at high energy .",
    "moreover , the calculated xmcd spectrum is in phase with the calculated exafs spectrum .",
    "this phase relation between dichroic and normal spectra was observed experimentally by pizzini and coll . @xcite",
    "it is sometimes assumed that xmcd reflects the spin - polarization of @xmath4 states projected on the absorbing atom ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "[ pdos ] shows that the absorption spectrum is indeed quite similar to the @xmath4 density of states , but the xmcd spectrum is quite different from the spin polarization of the @xmath4 density of states .",
    "in fact , the spin - polarization is very similar to the derivative of the density of states .",
    "in other words , the rigid band model becomes correct at high energy ( a somewhat surprising result ) , and the band splitting is about 1  ev .",
    "> from this result , a very simple approximate expression can be derived for xmcd . assuming a rigid band model",
    ", we can consider that the up and down bands are exchange - splitted by the energy @xmath176 .",
    "moreover , neglecting the non - diagonal terms of the spin - orbit operator , one can consider that the @xmath177 components of the @xmath4-band are split by spin - orbit coupling @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , for transitions towards @xmath179 final states ( left - circularly polarized x - rays ) , we have @xmath180 and for transitions towards @xmath181 final states ( right - circularly polarized x - rays ) : @xmath182 therefore , xmcd becomes @xmath183 since @xmath184 is fairly constant at high energy , the exchange - splitting energy @xmath176 can be deduced from experimental spectra .",
    "figure  [ deriveeseconde ] shows xmcd together with the second derivative of the normal spectrum ( multiplied by 10 ) . because the model is very crude , the agreement is not perfect , but good enough to say that the image deduced from the rigid - band model is correct .",
    "the presence of this second derivative explains also the phase relation between exafs and xmcd ( considering exafs as a sum of sines ) . a more elaborate interpretation comes from considering the expression for @xmath185 ( eq .",
    "( [ sigma0n ] ) ) and @xmath170 ( eq .  ( [ sigma1l ] ) ) .",
    "both expressions involve the multiple - scattering matrix @xmath186 , but @xmath170 contains an additional factor @xmath187 that makes it proportional to the real part of @xmath186 , whereas the exafs cross section is proportional to its imaginary part ( it was checked that the other factors do not intervene much in the phase at high energy ) . since real and imaginary part of the green function are related by kramers - kronig theorem , which transforms sine functions into cosine functions , and because dichroic effect is due to the difference between spin up and spin down @xmath170 , it is proportional to the derivative of the real part of @xmath186 which , because of an additional minus sign , is in phase with the imaginary part of the multiple - scattering matrix ( to see this , consider that , in the exafs regime , the green function can be approximate by @xmath188 , the imaginary part is a sine function - the exafs formula - and the derivative of the real part is a sine function as well ) .",
    "of course , this correspondence between xmcd and exafs is not exact , and much interesting information comes from the difference .",
    "the program that we used to calculate the xmcd spectrum of iron is relatively heavy and slow . to make the analysis of xmcd spectra as easy as that of normal absorption spectra , it is necessary to investigate the validity of the multiple - scattering expansion which is used by much faster programs , such as feff .",
    "@xcite to do this , we compare the results obtained by the full inversion of @xmath189 with the single scattering expansion ( @xmath190 ) and the double - scattering expansion ( previous term plus @xmath191 ) .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ multiplescattering ] .",
    "the overall agreement is correct but not excellent , probably because of the shadowing effect which is large in bcc structures .",

    "all these calculations were restricted to a narrow energy range around the edge .",
    "we have developed in this paper a multiple - scattering approach which allows for the calculation of extended structure , and includes the core hole without additional effort .",
    "we have presented a solution of the convergence difficulties associated to the one - electron calculation of physical properties related to spin - orbit interaction . a recourse to green functions with complex energy argument led us to smooth absorption and xmcd cross - sections .",
    "the presence of the fermi level was accounted for through a complex plane integration which was found much more stable than on the real line .",
    "this technique can be used to calculate other spin - orbit influenced properties , such as anisotropy energy or spin - dependent spectroscopies .",
    "robust and accurate numerical methods were proposed to evaluate the green function in the whole complex plane , and the smooth behavior of the cluster green function for large imaginary energies was explained .",
