    "georgi has conjectured a hidden scale invariant sector in the high - energy theory @xcite that could interact with the standard model ( sm ) via scale invariant fields associated with the so - called unparticles , a denomination due to the fact that scale invariant fields with nontrivial anomalous dimension can not be interpreted in terms of particles .",
    "although the description of such a theory could be extremely complex , one can still study its low - energy effects through the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the ingredients to describe the effective lagrangian that parametrizes the unparticle interactions with the sm can be found in @xcite : the hidden sector is a banks and zaks @xmath12 sector and the associated fields are introduced through renormalizable operators @xmath13 . the interaction of this sector with the sm fields occurs through the exchange of heavy particles at a very high - energy scale @xmath14 .",
    "below such a scale , there emerge nonrenormalizable couplings between the @xmath15 sector and the sm .",
    "as scale invariance emerges , dimensional transmutation proceeds via the renormalizable couplings of the @xmath15 sector at an energy scale @xmath16 .",
    "an effective theory can describe the interactions of the @xmath17 and sm fields , which occur via unparticles .",
    "the effective lagrangian can be written as @xcite :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 stands for the coupling constant , whereas the unparticle operator , @xmath20 , can be of fractional dimension @xmath5 . the unparticle operators , which can be constructed out of the primary operators @xmath13 and their transmutation , can be of scalar , vector , spinor , or tensor type .",
    "unparticle propagators are constructed using unitary cuts and the spectral decomposition formula . by this means , the propagator of a spin-0 unparticle is found to be : @xmath21 where the @xmath22 function is introduced to normalize the spectral density @xcite and is given as follows : @xmath23 as for the propagator of a spin-1 unparticle , it is @xmath24 the condition @xmath25 is fulfilled when the unparticle field is transverse , namely , @xmath26 .",
    "unparticle phenomenology has been widely studied .",
    "for instance , peculiar effects arising from the interference between unparticle and sm contributions could show up in the drell - yan process at hadronic colliders @xcite .",
    "the direct production of unparticles has also been studied in both leptonic @xcite and hadronic colliders @xcite .",
    "not only the tree - level unparticle effects have been the focus of attention , but also one - loop induced effects @xcite : the electron magnetic dipole moment via scalar and vector unparticles was first obtained in refs .",
    "this study was later extended for the lepton magnetic moment due to scalar @xcite and vector @xcite unparticles with lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) couplings , whereas the lepton electric dipole moment via scalar @xcite and vector @xcite unparticles was studied more recently .",
    "other studies worth mentioning deal with the potential unparticle effects on cp violation @xcite , neutrino physics @xcite , etc .",
    "direct constraints on the scale @xmath16 and the dimension @xmath5 have been extracted from the lep , tevatron and lhc data .",
    "for instance , the @xmath27 process was studied to explain @xmath28 production at lep @xcite .",
    "more recently the cms collaboration has imposed constraints on the unparticle parameters from the data of the search for monojets plus large missing transverse energy at the lhc @xcite .",
    "indirect constraints have also been obtained from experimental data in cosmology , astrophysics @xcite , the muon magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) , and lfv processes @xcite .",
    "as far as lfv is concerned , it is well known that any signal of this class of transitions would be a clear evidence of new physics .",
    "strong experimental constraints on lfv muon decays have been placed that considerably disfavor this class of processes : br@xmath29 @xcite , br@xmath30 @xcite , and br@xmath31 @xcite . on the other hand , there are less stringent constraints on lfv tau decays : br@xmath32 , br@xmath33 @xcite , br@xmath34 @xcite , and br@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is still a chance that @xmath0 transitions may occur with a measurable rate .",
    "such a possibility has been explored in several sm extensions . in this work",
    "we are interested in the study of @xmath0 conversion via the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) process @xmath36 , where @xmath2 is a nucleon , in the context of unparticle physics .",
    "this process , which could be at the reach of a future neutrino or muon factory , has attracted some attention during the past @xcite .",
    "we will consider the contributions from both spin-0 and spin-1 unparticles assuming the current bounds on the unparticle scale and the lfv unparticle couplings .",
    "the tensor unparticle contribution will not be considered as it is suppressed by the inverse of @xmath37 , which stems from the fact that the spin-2 unparticle operator is of higher dimension than that of the spin-0 and spin-1 unparticles .",
    "the study of @xmath0 conversion induced by lfv scalar- and vector - mediated , four fermion couplings , @xmath38 , via dis has already been discussed in the context of effective lagrangians @xcite and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite . it was concluded that a 50 gev muon beam with intensity of @xmath7 muons on a nucleon target per year , as expected in a neutrino factory @xcite , would allow for about @xmath39 @xmath40 events annually as long as the corresponding cross section is of the order of a few fb .",
    "this rate could give some room for either detecting the signal or placing stringent limits on @xmath0 couplings .",
    "the rest of the work is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the calculation of the process @xmath41 in the context of unparticle physics . the numerical analysis and discussion",

    "we obtain    @xmath63 subprocess .",

    "( [ scapropagator ] ) .    on the other hand , the corresponding contributions of a spin-1 unparticle are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we can now fold the above expressions with the nucleon parton distribution functions to obtain the cross section for the process @xmath42 .",
    "for instance , if we consider an isoscalar nucleon @xmath71 , with mass @xmath72 , we obtain for the contribution of a spin-0 unparticle : @xmath73 where @xmath74 @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "also , @xmath77 and @xmath78 stand for the valence quark distribution functions , whereas @xmath79 stands for the sea quark distribution function .",
    "we omitted the explicit dependence on @xmath51 and @xmath55 .",
    "unfortunately there is dependence on several free parameters .",
    "so , without losing generality we will assume that the pseudoscalar and vector - axial unparticle couplings are negligible as compared to the scalar and vector couplings , i.e. @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contributions of the lfv couplings @xmath82 to the muon mdm , @xmath83 , are negative and thus they are strongly disfavored by the current experimental data @xcite , which require a positive contribution to @xmath83 to bring the theoretical prediction closer to the experimental value . with these assumptions , we obtain the following expressions for the double differential cross sections    @xmath84    @xmath85    with @xmath86",

    "( [ sigma ] ) , we need to discuss the current bounds on the fermion unparticle couplings and the unparticle scale and dimension .",
    "we will assume that the unparticle couplings to quark pairs are flavor blind , with @xmath96 , whereas for the lfv couplings @xmath97 we will consider the most stringent constraints obtained from the experimental limits on lfv tau decays and the muon mdm for values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 consistent with the search for monojets plus missing transverse energy at the lhc by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "shortly after the advent of georgi s unparticle conjecture , bounds on the scale @xmath4 and the dimension @xmath98 were obtained by using the lep data of monophoton production plus missing transverse energy @xcite .",
    "more recently , the data of the search for monojet production plus missing transverse energy at the lhc were used by the cms collaboration to constrain the parameters associated with a spin-0 unparticle @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that the region @xmath99 is strongly disfavored as @xmath100 tev is required to be consistent with the lhc data . on the other hand , for @xmath5 close to 2 , @xmath101 tev is still allowed .",

    "it is worth noting that the cms bounds were obtained assuming unparticle couplings of the order of unity .",
    "so , these bounds would be weaker if couplings of smaller size were considered .",
    "we now turn to discuss the current constraints on the lfv unparticle couplings .",
    "as stated above , for simplicity we will neglect fcnc unparticle couplings in the quark sector and consider that the diagonal couplings @xmath109 are flavor blind and of the order of @xmath110 .",

    "such a dramatic increase is due to the contribution of the sea @xmath166 quark , which is enhanced by a factor of @xmath167 with respect to that of the sea @xmath168 quark .",
    "on the other hand , the unparticle contributions are considerably smaller than those obtained in @xcite for the calculation of the quasielastic process @xmath169 using the four - fermion lfv scalar coupling . however , in that analysis , a value of @xmath170 , with @xmath171 tev , was used for the associated coupling constant , whereas we are considering strong bounds on the lfv unparticle coupling constants .",

    "it means that , in this situation , a low - energy tau would be emitted at a larger angle than a high - energy tau . on the other hand ,",
