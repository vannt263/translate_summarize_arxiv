    "1985 ) emission lines from their gaseous disks .",
    "as discussed in the review by de zeeuw & franx ( 1991 ) , for example , elliptical galaxies in general do nt have much gas , and it has been difficult to find any evidence for the possible presence of massive halos around them .",
    "globular clusters are ideal probes for studying the dynamics of the outer parts of galaxies . their masses can be ignored compared to the mass of the galaxy . except in the galaxy , their distances from the galactic center and their orbits can not be determined directly , but they are plentiful enough around some galaxies that statistics can be used to overcome this limitation .",
    "one such case is m87 at the center of the virgo cluster , which has an extremely rich globular cluster system , with thousands of members .",
    "4-m class telescopes are just large enough to reach the brightest of these spectroscopically , and they have been studied by mould , oke & nemec ( 1987 ) , huchra & brodie ( 1987 ) and mould et al .",

    "grillmair et al .",
    "have assembled a sample of similar size for globular clusters in ngc 1399 , the cd galaxy in the fornax cluster of galaxies .",
    "but because of the small sample size , their estimates of the many critical kinematic parameters of these globular cluster systems , including the rotation and the velocity dispersion as a function of radius , are of low accuracy .",
    "merritt & tremblay ( 1993 ) estimated from numerical simulations that a sample of @xmath2200 globular clusters in m87 is required to derive accurately the most fundamental parameter of the mass distribution of the halo of m87 , the exponent of the power law for the radial mass profile .",
    "we present here a study of the kinematics of the globular clusters around m87 with the goal of probing the distribution of mass around this galaxy at the center of the virgo cluster , deducing the mass - to - light ratio in the halo of m87 , and comparing our results to inferences from recent x - ray missions and from recent optical spectroscopy of the stellar component of m87 . with the light gathering power of the 10m keck",

    ".    a study of the abundances and ages of the m87 globular clusters that can also be inferred from our data set will follow shortly .",
    "the candidates were chosen from the photographic survey of strom et al .",
    "( 1981 ) for globular clusters in m87 .",
    "this survey of objects with @xmath4 mag covers a square region about 14 arc - min on a side .",
    "the central region of m87 ( @xmath5 arc - sec ) was excluded , presumably due to saturation of the photographic plates , and the candidate list is incomplete out to @xmath6 arc - sec .",
    "there are 1728 objects in their sample .",
    "our sample includes the 723 objects with @xmath7 mag from the strom et al .  survey .",
    "we have found that their object positions are adequate for designing slit masks that align satisfactorily .",
    "a sample of bright globular cluster candidates near the center of m87 was added to fill in the central region .",
    "the radial distances from the center of m87 of these added objects range from 24 to 71 arc - sec .",
    "they were chosen from direct images taken with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris , oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the 10meter keck i telescope and their positions relative to the bright globular cluster strom 928 , which is itself 23.2 arc - sec west and 62.3 arc - sec north of the nucleus of m87 , are given in table  1 .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use the strom et al .",
    "( 1981 ) running numbers to identify the clusters , while the additional objects near the center of m87 are denoted with running numbers beginning with 5001 .",
    "about half of the objects in the list of candidates defined above were actually observed . for each slitmask ,",
    "the first selection criterion was that the location of the candidate be close to the centerline of the slitmask in the lris focal plane , while the second one was brightness .",
    "the few very bright objects were avoided , as they are mostly galactic stars , while objects in the faintest 0.5 mag of the sample were not included in slitmasks unless no other suitable candidate was available near the desired position in the sky .",
    "the spectra of about 15% of the objects in these 14 slitmasks were too noisy and no features could be recognized , hence no radial velocity could be deduced .",
    "14 m dwarfs ( strom 38 , 87 , 246 , 354 , 670 , 681 , 782 , 801 , 937 , 996 , 1549 , 1551 , 1608 and 1610 ) and one white dwarf ( strom 178 ) were found .",
    "these are assumed to be galactic stars and are not considered further .",
    "the sample of candidate globular clusters in m87 turns out to be badly contaminated by galaxies , particularly in the outer parts of m87 . whenever possible , to eliminate background galaxies , direct images taken with lris were used to verify that candidate m87 globulars had images that were not extended .",
    "such lris direct images , particularly for the outermost parts of m87 , were not always available before the masks had to be designed .",
    "table  2 lists the 44 galaxies that were found .",
    "if no redshift is given , the galaxy was identified as such from lris direct images .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution on the sky of the objects with measured radial velocities , including the galactic stars and the galaxies , as well as that of the entire @xmath7 mag sample from strom s lists .",
    "we have used the lris on the keck i telescope in the multi - slit mode .",
    "slitmasks whose length was 7.3 arc - min were used to maximize the efficiency of observations , with an average of 28 objects per mask .",
    "two or three 3000 second exposures were obtained for each slitmask .",
    "all the observations used 600 g / mm gratings ( dispersion 1.24  / pixel ) with 1.4 arc - sec wide slits giving an effective resolution of 8.1   ( ignoring anamorphic magnification , which improves this somewhat , especially in the red ) .",
    "the detector is a @xmath8 pixel tektronix ccd , so the spectral coverage is @xmath22500  .",
    "these observations were carried out on 7 nights over a 3 year period .",
    "the seeing near the zenith for these nights ranged from 0.6 to 1.2 arc - sec .    a total of 14 different slitmasks have been used . in 1994 ,",
    "four masks were used with the 600 g / mm grating blazed at 7500  centered at 8400 .",
    "the dominant feature in these spectra is the infrared ca triplet . in early 1994 ,",
    "the detector electronics were noisier than they should have been , a situation corrected in mid-1994 . in 1995 , 8 masks were used with that same grating centered at 5500  so as to pick up the mg triplet and nearby strong fe blends , as well as the balmer lines @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these masks have a position angle of 0@xmath11 to 315@xmath11 in 45@xmath11 increments .",
    "each mask is laid out radially along its selected position angle , with one end of the effective slit placed close to the nucleus of m87 near the inner radial limit of the strom et al .",
    "( 1981 ) survey . in 1996 ,",
    "a new 600 g / mm grating became available with a bluer blaze angle ( 5000 ) .",
    "this was used with two masks centered on the nucleus of m87 .",
    "the exposures here were only 2500 sec long , with 2 or 3 exposures per slitmask .",
    "these spectra were again centered at 5500 . with the exception of the 1996 spectra , all these observations used dual amplifier readouts to maximize the efficiency of observing .",
    "since these are multi - slit spectra , the actual wavelength coverage for a particular object depends on its position with respect to the center of the entrance field of the lris .",
    "the lris has some flexure . in part because of this , the spectra were not flat fielded , although they were corrected for the difference in bias level and gain between the two amplifiers used in the dual amplifier readout .",
    "after this , the cosmic rays were removed .",
    "then the individual slitlet spectra were cut out of the full ccd frame .",
    "next the two - dimensional spectrum of each slitlet was corrected for distortions both along and perpendicular to the dispersion , arising partially from distortions in the lris camera as well as from the long slit length used by lris slitmasks .",
    "a second order polynomial was fit to the sky across each pixel in the dispersion direction , the sky was removed , and the appropriate sum along the slit yielded the spectrum for each object .",
    "the one - dimensional spectra from the various exposures of a given object with a given mask were summed to get the final result for each candidate .",
    "the dominant problem in these spectra ( at least after mid-1994 , when the detector electronics were fixed ) is the non - uniformity of the width of the slit .",
    "the slits are punched by a numerically controlled machine , and need to be carefully cleaned of chips prior to use .",
    "variations of a few percent in width are common , variations of 5% occasionally occur , and even larger variations occur if the masks are not cleaned properly .",
    "efforts are underway within cara to reduce or eliminate this problem . correction of this variation of slit width is not straightforward given the flexure , and was not incorporated into our analysis scripts .    to ensure the best possible accuracy ,",
    "the wavelength calibration was carried out using the most unblended night sky emission lines within the spectra of the globular clusters themselves .",
    "the region of the infrared ca triplet is full of such , and there the wavelength calibration is very good .",
    "typical fits ( a third order polynomial suffices ) including 14 night sky lines distributed along the length of the spectrum have a 1@xmath12 rms residual in the fit of 0.2   ( 7 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the 5500   region has far fewer lines both in the night sky spectrum ( no hg lines are seen from mauna kea ) and in the available arc spectra .",
    "the 5199   night sky emission line is the last detectable night sky emission feature on the blue side of these spectra .",
    "its presence was crucial to anchor the wavelength scale .",
    "when the background of the integrated stellar light of m87 is very bright , this weak emission line is sometimes lost . in a very few cases , for @xmath13 , the wavelength scale at the blue end had to be determined from other spectra with better arc coverage .",
    "the wavelength scale of each exposure of each multislit was independently calibrated .",
    "all the data analysis was carried out using figaro .",
    "the spectra of the m87 globular clusters show no sign of spatial or velocity resolution .",
    "the `` sky '' spectra , consisting of the night sky and the halo light from m87 itself , show obvious line broadening for those globular clusters close to the center of m87 , presumably due to the velocity dispersion of the m87 stars .",
    "these spectra of candidate globular clusters in m87 cover one of two different wavelength regions .",
    "the radial velocities for the spectra centered at 8500  were obtained by averaging those inferred from @xmath9 , which occasionally fell within the wavelength regime covered , and from each of the detected components of the infrared ca triplet .",
    "( only for the brightest m87 globular clusters was the weakest of the triplet lines clearly detected . )",
    "the radial velocities for the spectra centered at 5500  were obtained via averaging the results of cross correlations covering the region from 5150 to 5400   and also the @xmath9 region .",
    "@xmath9 is outside the wavelength region covered in about 25% of these spectra .",
    "while @xmath10 is often included , the wavelength scale at 4900   is poorly determined .",
    "the brightest m87 globular cluster in the particular mask being reduced was used as a template for the spectra from that mask .",
    "its radial velocity was determined using the laboratory wavelengths of the mg triplet , of the adjacent strong fe blends , and of @xmath9 .",
    "the cross correlations were checked by visual inspection of the spectra , as sometimes spikes from cosmic rays throw the results off , and these had to be removed manually from the spectra or the radial velocity determined via eye estimates of the line centers .",
    "table 3 lists the heliocentric radial velocity for 229 candidate globular clusters in m87 in our sample .",
    "the histogram of heliocentric radial velocities for the candidate m87 globular clusters is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is double peaked , with the majority of the objects distributed about the radial velocity of m87 , while about 10% of the objects reside in a narrower peak centered on 0 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "even though the m dwarfs have already been excluded , substantial contamination by galactic stars is still present .",
    "since it is impossible to separate the galactic stars of spectral type k from m87 globular clusters within this peak , we reject all objects with @xmath14 km  s@xmath0 , almost all of which are undoubtedly galactic stars .",
    "this brings the number of objects in our sample down to 205 . to avoid skewing the distributions",
    ", we must also reject objects in the corresponding interval of the high velocity tail of the @xmath15 distribution .",
    "however , there are no objects with such large positive radial velocities in our sample .",
    "these 205 globular clusters in m87 with kinematic data from our lris observations are the sample used in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the accuracy of the radial velocities depends on many factors , including the signal in the spectrum of the object , the signal in the spectrum of the background , the strength of the spectral features for each object , the accuracy of the background subtraction algorithm used , etc .",
    "the signal in the spectrum of the object depends on the transparency during the observations , the integration time ( 6000 or 9000 sec total ) , and the accuracy of alignment of the object with the slitlet in the slitmask .",
    "if the object is too close to the upper or lower edge of the slitlet , sky subtraction becomes more difficult .",
    "another potential source of error is illumination effects . in normal long slit spectra ,",
    "the radial velocity for a point source depends on where the source is located within the width of the slit and on the seeing . for multi - slit spectra , the same effect operates .",
    "but now it depends on the accuracy of the astrometry and object positions used to design the slitmask and on the accuracy of alignment of the objects on the sky to the physical slitmask in the entrance aperture of the spectrograph .",
    "the individual errors may vary from object to object and cause a spurious velocity dispersion .",
    "we denote the quantity of interest , the 1d difference between the location of the object and the center of its slitlet as seen by the spectrograph , both measured in the dispersion direction , as @xmath16",
    ". detailed logs of each slitmask alignment procedure are available for most of the 1995 and 1996 lris observations .",
    "they indicate a median 1@xmath12 rms value for @xmath16 of 0.4 arc - sec .",
    "this corresponds to 2.3  ( 135 km  s@xmath0   at 5100 , 81 km  s@xmath0   at 8500 ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that the actual errors introduced into the data are at least a factor of two smaller than this due to the smoothing effects of the seeing .",
    "these globular cluster spectra have much higher signal - to - noise ratios than any previous m87 spectra . for a typical m87 globular cluster candidate with @xmath17 mag ,",
    "we accumulate , summed along the slit , @xmath22220 detected photoelectrons / pixel in the dispersion direction in the sky - subtracted spectra centered at 5500   per 3000 sec of exposure .",
    "the sky , avoiding strong emission lines , and in the outer parts of m87 is @xmath1810% as bright . in many cases the accuracy of the radial velocities",
    "are limited by the systematics of the definition of the wavelength scale rather than the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra .",
    "this subject will be discussed in more detail in the second paper of this series on the abundances in the m87 globular clusters .",
    "here we merely assert that the 1@xmath12 uncertainty in the radial velocities of table 3 is under 100 km  s@xmath0 .    for high signal - to - noise spectra , one can fairly easily achieve a centroiding error of 0.1 pixels , which translates directly into a @xmath15 error .",
    "our adopted @xmath15 error of 100 km  s@xmath0   translates into 1.4 pixels ( 0.2 resolution elements ) at 5100   and into 2.3 pixels ( 0.35 resolution elements ) at 8500  .",
    "thus our adopted radial velocity error of 100 km  s@xmath0   is indeed very conservative .",
    "there are several ways to demonstrate that our data in fact achieve this level of accuracy .",
    "first we note that the mean heliocentric radial velocity for the 205 m87 globular clusters in our sample is 1301 @xmath1927 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the mean heliocentric @xmath15 for m87 itself based on long slit high dispersion spectroscopy of the nuclear region of the galaxy is 1277 @xmath195 km  s@xmath0(van der marel 1994 ) .",
    "the agreement is extremely good .",
    "next we examine the objects in the final sample which have been observed more than once .",
    "42 objects were observed twice , while one was observed 3 times .",
    "( objects were observed twice because objects observed in the ca triplet region were not automatically eliminated when designing masks to be used at 5500 .",
    "in addition , in certain places on the sky there were not many suitable objects , so the same candidate was selected to be included on multiple slitmasks . )",
    "figure 3 shows the histogram of the difference between the two measurements for the 43 objects that have been observed twice ( including one observed 3 times ) .",
    "table 4 gives the @xmath12 for the velocity difference between pairs of measurements where both spectra are in the 8500   region , pairs with 1 spectrum at the infrared ca triplet and the second at the mg triplet , and pairs with both spectra centered at the mg triplet .",
    "the final column of table 4 gives the @xmath12 for a single radial velocity measurement inferred from the @xmath12 of the differences of pairs of measurements .",
    "table 4 confirms , as expected , that the accuracy of @xmath15 from the spectra centered at 8500   is higher than that from the spectra centered at 5100 .",
    "again , we conclude that 100 km  s@xmath0   is a conservative value for the 1@xmath12 uncertainties in our radial velocities of candidate globular clusters in m87 .",
    "the isophotes of m87 are not circular .",
    "many analyses of surface photometry for this galaxy exist ( see , for example , cohen 1986 ) and they have established that the ellipticity increases outwards , reaching about 10% at a semi - major axis of about 80 arc - sec , with a major axis position angle of @xmath20 .",
    "there is no evidence for rotation exceeding 20 km  s@xmath0   in amplitude in m87 from optical spectroscopy .",
    "however the available data is often restricted to a single position angle , usually the minor axis , and to a small slit length on the sky ( an effort to obtain maximum spatial resolution near the nucleus to look for a nuclear black hole ) .",
    "such is the case for the kinematic studies of bender et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and van der marel ( 1994 ) .",
    "jarvis & peletier ( 1991 ) looked at 4 position angles with a slit that covered @xmath1925 arc - sec from the nucleus , and found a maximum amplitude of rotation of 20 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the recent work of sembach & tonry ( 1996 ) reaches to about 100 arc - sec out from the nucleus of m87 .",
    "although the authors say nothing about rotation , based on their long slit spectrum along the major axis there is marginal evidence for it with an amplitude of not more than 30 km  s@xmath0   and with the se sector of the galaxy having the larger radial velocity than the nw sector .",
    "we solve for rotation in the globular cluster system of m87 using the levenberg - marquardt non - linear least squares fitting routines from press et al .",
    "( 1986 ) to fit a sinusoid in position angle ( plus a constant mean velocity ) to the observed radial velocities of the 205 globular clusters .",
    "the results for all the clusters , and then for them divided into two radial bins , are given in table 5 , where the number of m87 globular clusters in the sample , the mean @xmath15 , the rotational velocity ( @xmath21 ) , and position angle at which the rotational contribution to @xmath15 is largest are given .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath21 is about 20% .",
    "figure 4 shows the rotation curve as a function of position angle for the 205 globular clusters over two cycles .",
    "the solid line indicates the fit to the sample as a whole given on the first line of table 5 .",
    "this figure does not appear as convincing as might be desired .",
    "so we carried out simulations where the velocities of the m87 globular clusters were kept at their observed values , but their position angles were replaced by random values between 0@xmath11 and 360@xmath11 and the data set was then analyzed for rotation .",
    "we conducted 200 trials of this procedure .",
    "these trials indicate that only 4% of the time does the artificial data show rotation as large or larger than that of the actual data for the m87 globular clusters presented here .",
    "thus we infer a definite rotation in m87 which is approximately ( to with 30@xmath11 ) about the minor axis of the galaxy as defined from its intensity isophotes .",
    "@xmath21 is about 100 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "this study , sembach & tonry s ( 1996 ) long slit spectroscopy , and mould et al s ( 1990 ) earlier analysis of the m87 globular cluster system all agree on the direction of the rotation ( larger @xmath15 along the major axis to the se , smaller @xmath15 to the nw ) .",
    "we need to adopt a definite rotational velocity profile in order to correct the observed radial velocities . for this purpose",
    "we adopt a truncated solid body law , @xmath22 with the restriction that @xmath23 km  s@xmath0 , where @xmath24 is the projected radius ( in arc - sec ) and @xmath25 = 140@xmath11 . the exact nature of the form adopted for @xmath21 is not important , since in the next section we will show that rotation is small compared to the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the m87 globular cluster system .",
    "we have carried out a kolmogorov - smirnov test on the observed radial velocity histogram of the m87 globular cluster system with the rotational corrections included .",
    "we find that more than 90% of the samples of 205 points drawn from a normal distribution with a mean and variance matching that of our ensemble will differ more from a gaussian than do the actual data for the m87 globular clusters presented here .",
    "we are now in a position to compute the velocity dispersions .",
    "the 205 objects believed to be bona fide globular clusters in m87 are included .",
    "heliocentric corrections are applied and the rotation is removed using the prescription given above .    the m87 globular cluster sample is divided into a number of radial bins , and the mean velocity and velocity dispersion are calculated for each bin",
    ". then the most discrepant object is eliminated , and the mean and dispersion are calculated again .",
    "table 6 gives the results with and without the rotational correction described above .",
    "the differences between the two are not large .",
    "the sampling uncertainties in @xmath26 assuming @xmath15 has a gaussian distribution of @xmath26/@xmath27 are also given for one case .",
    "in the final column of table 6 we give the values to be adopted for subsequent use .",
    "they include the rotation correction , and an instrumental uncertainty of 100 km / sec has been removed in quadrature .",
    "the velocity dispersion for the early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster is 570 km  s@xmath0  ( binggeli , tammann & sandage 1987 ) , even larger than that of our outermost point .",
    "our goal is to establish in a definitive manner whether or not dark matter exists in the halo of m87 , how much dark matter exists , and how certain we are of such claims .",
    "we wish to find a distribution of mass within m87 that reproduces the velocity dispersion as a function of projected radius ( @xmath24 ) that we have derived from our observations of the m87 globular cluster system .",
    "there are many observations of the surface brightness of m87 , so once a mass distribution is available , the mass - to - light ratio can easily be computed .",
    "`` light '' throughout this discussion refers to the integrated light at @xmath28 ( 5500 ) of m87 , which is dominated by the stellar component of m87 , although the m87 globular clusters do make a small contribution as well .    as a first reconnaissance , although we know that the outer isophotes of m87 are not circular , the ellipticity is small , and we treat @xmath29 as spherical where @xmath1 is the radius .",
    "we begin by assuming that the mass is distributed as is the light of m87 , i.e. @xmath30 is constant .",
    "hernquist ( 1990 ) proposed a general model density distribution for spherical galaxies which has some very desirable properties . over a wide range in radius",
    "the projected mass derived from this density distribution matches the well known @xmath31 dependence for surface brightness .",
    "many properties of this density distribution , including the line - of - sight velocity dispersion for both isotropic and circular orbits , can be expressed as analytical functions .",
    "this model , which is the model used by mould et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , has two free parameters , a spatial scale ( @xmath32 ) and a total mass , @xmath33 .    since a hernquist model with @xmath32 = 52 arc - sec ( 3.8 kpc )",
    "fits the m87 surface brightness profile , we proceed to use this analytical mass model .",
    "we use the surface brightness measurements of boroson , thompson & shectman ( 1993 ) and of de vaucouleurs & nieto ( 1978 ) to numerically integrate for the enclosed surface brightness ( @xmath34 ) , and use the model only to calculate the deprojection factor @xmath35 .",
    "we assume a galactic absorption @xmath36 of 0.14 mag .",

    "the agreement between the optical long slit spectroscopy and our data is good .",
    "figure 5 shows clearly how tightly confined towards the nucleus the optical data is , an indication of the intense interest in the search for a nuclear black hole as well as the fact that the rapidly decreasing surface brightness of the m87 stellar halo makes such observations at larger radii impossible .    the model with mass following the light of m87 , which by definition has a constant mass - to - light ratio ,",
    "does not fit the data .    in an effort to find a suitable fit",
    ", we try varying the orbital distribution of the m87 globular clusters .",
    "the dot - dashed line in figure 5 represents the predicted line - of - sight velocity dispersion for the m87 globular cluster system assuming purely circular orbits in the hernquist potential whose parameters ( @xmath33 and @xmath32 ) have the values adopted above .",
    "the dashed line represents a system under these conditions with radial orbits .",
    "this curve was obtained by numerical integration of the spherical jeans equation with the appropriate orbital anisotropy term .",
    "one might adopt an orbital distribution for the m87 globlar clusters that varies with @xmath1 , depending on one s prejudices about globular cluster formation and survival .",
    "for example , clusters with radial orbits might not survive at small @xmath1 , but might survive at large @xmath1 where they do not undergo repeated passages through the nucleus of m87 .",
    "however , one expects a system with a fixed total mass and with an intermediate family of orbits to lie within the area bounded by the upper and lower of the three thick curves in figure 5 .",
    "the range of behavior shown by the various orbital distributions is not capable of explaining the observed data within the assumption of a fixed @xmath30 ratio .",
    "the distribution of @xmath15 of the m87 globular clusters provides an additional constraint on the orbital characteristics although it probably requires a larger sample of m87 globular clusters to exploit this ( merritt 1997 , merritt et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "to get some idea of what kind of a mass model is in fact required to match the data , we adopt as a toy model a central point mass and isotropic orbits for the probes .",
    "the central mass required to match the data in each radial bin , @xmath39 , can then be calculated directly from @xmath43 ( equation 10 - 6 of binney & tremaine 1994 ) , where @xmath1 is a radius , not a projected radius .",
    "assuming galaxies are located at their projected radii , we calculate @xmath44 for each radial bin to obtain @xmath39 .",
    "this yields the mass - to - light ratios as a function of @xmath1 given in table 7 , with @xmath45 .",
    "the required @xmath30 in the outer part of m87 are very large , more than 10 time those of the inner part of m87 .",
    "changing the orbital characteristics for the m87 globular clusters ( isotropic versus circular versus radial orbits ) and allowing for the corrections associated with a proper calculation of the gravitating mass will not alter the fundamental result that there must be a substantial amount of dark matter in the outer part of m87 , that @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "to derive a mass model we solve the spherical jeans equation assuming isotropic orbits and spherical symmetry    @xmath48    to evaluate the first term on the right side we use @xmath49 calculated earlier .",
    "the logarithmic derivative here varies from @xmath501.4 within the flat core of the globular cluster distribution in the inner part of m87 to @xmath503.6 for the outer part .",

    "( the de - projection term for @xmath51 is not large , never exceeding the 15% , and numerical integrations using @xmath49 give very similar results . )",

    ", @xmath52 is 2.7 , while the toy model described above has a factor of 4 .",
    "this indicates the magnitude of the correction factors from a simple central point mass spherical model with isotropic velocities , and provides some guidance as to the magnitude of the remaining model dependent uncertainties , which are primarily the choice of the orbital characteristics for the m87 globular cluster system .",
    "the results are given in table 8 .",
    "the uncertainties indicated for @xmath39 are from sampling errors only and do not include any contribution for modelling uncertainties , problems with the rotation corrections , etc . also note that the @xmath53 at @xmath1 is the ratio averaged over the enclosed volume , not the value at @xmath1 itself .",
    "sargent et al .  ( 1978 ) obtained @xmath54 ( using the same definition of `` light '' as we are using ) between @xmath55 and 71.8 arc - sec , their outermost point , a result reproduced by saglia , bertin & stiavelli ( 1992 ) with their more sophisticated models .",
    "the agreement for the region of overlap of the two data sets is good .",
    "mould et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , with a very limited sample of data , found @xmath56 , in reasonable agreement with the above . our much larger sample has allowed us to put their preliminary results on a much firmer basis and to derive a detailed model for the behavior of @xmath39 .",
    "fitting a power law to @xmath39 yields an exponent of 1.7 , and the @xmath30 ratios must be very large ( @xmath57 ) in the outer part of m87 .",
    "there is no way of re - working the data , the assumptions , or the analysis that avoids this conclusion .",
    "very extended x - ray emission centered on m87 has been detected and can also be used to infer the gravitating mass of m87 . here one assumes hydrostatic equilibrium and that the velocity distribution of the gas particles is maxwellian ( isotropic ) with a velocity dispersion related to the temperature @xmath58 of the x - ray emitting gas in the usual way .",
    "the surface brightness of the x - ray emission can be measured by an x - ray imaging camera with suitable sensitivity , and reasonably precise measurements were obtained by the einstein satellite .",
    "the problem is the determination of @xmath58  such measurements were beyond the state of the art until quite recently .",
    "fabricant & gorenstein ( 1983 ) analyzed the einstein data for m87 .",
    "they concluded that @xmath30 increased from @xmath210 at @xmath1 = 1 arc - min to over 180 at @xmath1 = 20 arc - min ( @xmath287 kpc ) .",
    "they found a total mass of m87 within 20 arc - min of m87 of @xmath59 .",
    "though they could follow the surface brightness in a broad x - ray bandpass out to 90 arc - min , they could not determine @xmath58 beyond 25 arc - min .",
    "the uncertainty in their determinations of @xmath60 was large , and they quote results for many models of this parameter .",
    "the values given in table 9 are for their model 1 , an isothermal model with @xmath58 = 3 kev .",
    "tsai ( 1992 , 1994 ) has tried a more complex multi - phase model of the einstein data .",
    "he obtains similar results .",
    "nulson & bhringer ( 1995 ) provide a determination of the mass of the central virgo cluster using rosat data .",
    "their determinations for @xmath39 in the inner 100 kpc centered on m87 are about 2.5 times smaller than those of fabricant & gorenstein ( 1983 ) , partly due to their use of a lower @xmath58 there .",
    "meanwhile , asca , with its superb spectral resolution in the x - ray regime , has observed m87 as well ( matsumoto et al .",
    "the asca data convincingly demonstrate that at least two components are required to fit the x - ray spectra , with @xmath58 of 3 kev and 1.3 kev respectively .",
    "the hotter component has a more extended spatial distribution , and for both components , @xmath58 is approximately constant with @xmath1 .",
    "it is not obvious how to correct the rosat @xmath39 determinations in light of these new asca results , as the ratio of the emission measure for the hot and cool components of the gas is changing rapidly over the spatial region of interest .",
    "the best power - law fit to the rosat results of nulsen & bhringer ( 1995 ) in the regime @xmath61 kpc is @xmath62 , close to the @xmath63 found from the m87 globular cluster system .",
    "@xmath39 for the outer part of m87 is displayed in figure 7 .",
    "the solid points indicate the results from the present globular cluster data .",
    "the 1@xmath12 uncertainties shown include only observational limitations and do not include the modeling uncertainties , which are at most 50% .",
    "the best fit power law to these data is shown as the thick solid line .",
    "the large open circle is the result of mould et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , while the x - ray upper and lower limits from nulson & bhringer ( 1995 ) are shown as thin solid lines .",
    "the small open circles denote the values of sargent et al .",
    "( 1978 ) from optical spectroscopy of the stellar component of m87 .",
    "the overall agreement between these various methods , which rely on different sets of physical assumptions and measure the gravitating mass using different components of m87 as probes , in the regions of overlap is very gratifying .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of the dynamics of the m87 globular cluster system with the goal of determining the @xmath30 ratio in the outer parts of this massive galaxy in the core of the virgo cluster .",
    "a sample of globular cluster candidates in m87 has been observed using slit - masks with the lris on the keck i 10-meter telescope . after eliminating foreground galactic stars and background galaxies",
    ", we isolated 205 bona fide members of m87 globular cluster system .",
    "these globular clusters belong to m87 ; their mean @xmath15 is that of m87 itself to within the ( very small ) observational error .",
    "their velocity distribution is consistent with that of a gaussian about the mean @xmath15 .",
    "there is also evidence for rotation of the globular cluster system of m87 .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion of the m87 globular clusters increases with projected radius from about 270 km  s@xmath0   at @xmath1 = 9 kpc to @xmath64 km  s@xmath0   at @xmath65 kpc . the inferred @xmath30 increases from 5 for @xmath66 kpc to @xmath67 for @xmath68 kpc , where `` light '' refers to the integrated light of the stellar component of m87 at 5500 .",
    "@xmath33(44 kpc ) = 3 x 10@xmath69 , with @xmath63 for @xmath70 kpc .",
    "no permitted changes in the data analysis , assumptions , or model can eliminate the need for a substantial extended halo of dark matter in m87 .      in spiral galaxies determination of the properties of the dark matter",
    "halo from rotation curves is complicated by the presence of multiple components ( disk , bulge , and halo ) ( kent 1987 ) , and the properties of at least the first two of these are strongly variable from galaxy to galaxy , as well as by data which in most cases does not reach out as far in radius . in m87 , however , the dark halo dominates at @xmath71 kpc , and we have ben able to infer its spatial distribution in some detail .",
    "however m87 can hardly be described as a normal elliptical galaxy since it is located at the center of a massive cluster of galaxies surrounded by a very extensive halo of hot gas .",
    "an obvious task for the future is to look for evidence of dark matter in and around normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "the entire keck / lris user community owes a huge debt to jerry nelson , gerry smith , bev oke , and many other people who have worked to make the keck telescope and lris a reality .",
    "we are grateful to the w. m. keck foundation , and particularly its late president , howard keck , for the vision to fund the construction of the w. m. keck observatory .",

    "<S> we present the results from a study of the dynamics of the system of globular clusters around m87 . after eliminating foreground galactic stars and background galaxies </S>",
    "<S> , we end up with a sample of 205 bona fide m87 globular clusters for which we have radial velocities determined from multi - slit spectra taken with the lris on the keck telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mean radial velocity of the m87 globular clusters agrees well with that of m87 itself , and that the velocity histogram is well represented by a gaussian distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for rotation in the globular cluster system . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the observed velocity dispersion of the m87 globular cluster system increases with radius from 270 km  s@xmath0   at @xmath1 = 9 kpc to @xmath2400 km  s@xmath0   at @xmath1 = 40 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred mass - to - light ratio in solar units increases from 5 at @xmath1 = 9 kpc to @xmath230 at @xmath1 = 40 kpc with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the long slit optical spectroscopy near the center of m87 and the recent analysis of the rosat x - ray data are in good agreement with this analysis near the nucleus and in the outer parts of m87 respectively . </S>"
