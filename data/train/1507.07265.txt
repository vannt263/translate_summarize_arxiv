    "herding phenomena are ubiquitous in human and animal behavior @xcite .",
    "an example is an information cascade , in which a person observes others choices and chooses the majority s choice even though the person s private signal contradicts it @xcite .",
    "it is a rational behavior for people who are uncertain about choosing .",
    "if an information cascade occurs , the same mechanism applies to later decision - makers , and the majority s choice tends to prevail . in some cases ,",
    "the successive choices are wrong , and the cascade leads to irrational herding behavior @xcite .",
    "an experimental setup demonstrates a situation in which an information cascade occurs @xcite .",
    "there are two urns , a and b , and urn a ( b ) contains two _ a _ ( _ b _ ) balls and one _ b _",
    "( _ a _ ) ball . in each run of the experiment , an urn",
    "is randomly chosen initially and called x. then , the subjects guess whether urn x is a or b and choose sequentially .",
    "they get a reward for the correct choice . in the course of the experiment",
    ", each subject draws a ball from x , which is his private signal . if the ball is _ a _ ( _ b _ ) , urn x is more likely to be a ( b )",
    ". he also observes the choices of the previous subjects .",
    "if the difference between the numbers of subjects who choose each urn exceeds two , the private signal can not overcome the majority s choice .",
    "an information cascade starts if someone chooses the majority s choice although his private signal suggests the minority s one . as the probability that the first two persons both choose the wrong option is non - zero , the probability for the onset of a cascade where the majority s choice is wrong is positive .",
    "we now consider whether the wrong cascade continues @xcite .",
    "if it continues forever , the majority s choice converges to the wrong option .",
    "information cascades were initially considered to be fragile phenomena .",
    "as the trigger of the cascade is a small imbalance , people can be dissuaded from following the majority s choice @xcite .",
    "in addition , an agent model with a bayesian update of the private belief showed that the information cascade is self - correcting @xcite .",
    "as the number of agents tends toward infinity , the wrong cascade disappears , and the majority s choice converges to the optimal option .    using an information cascade experiment with a general knowledge two - choice quiz",
    ", we have shown that a phase transition occurs between a one - peak phase and a two - peak phase @xcite .",
    "if the questions are easy , the ratio @xmath11 of the correct choices of @xmath12 subjects converges to a value @xmath13 in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "as there is only one peak in the probability distribution function of @xmath11 , we call the corresponding phase the one - peak phase @xcite",
    ". if the questions are difficult and most people do not know the answers , @xmath11 converges to @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "one can not predict the value in @xmath15 to which @xmath11 converges .",
    "we call the corresponding phase the two - peak phase",
    ". in the two - peak phase , the wrong cascade does not necessarily disappear , and the system is not self - correcting .",
    "it was recently shown that the limit value of the normalized correlation function is the order parameter of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "the normalized correlation function shows how the first subject s choice propagates to later subjects .",
