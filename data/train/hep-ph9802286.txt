    "recently , the gams collaboration has continued the investigation of the reaction @xmath1 at @xmath8 gev [ 1 ] .",
    "the goal of the new experiment is to study the @xmath6 behavior of the s - wave @xmath0 mass spectrum in the region of the @xmath3 resonance ( @xmath6 is the square of the four - momentum transferred from the incoming @xmath9 to the outgoing @xmath0 system ) .",
    "the partial wave analysis performed in the range @xmath10 gev@xmath11 gave a very interesting and unexpected result .",

    "[ 2 - 11 ] , and for reviews , refs .",
    "[ 12 - 15 ] ) .",
    "] whereas for @xmath17 gev@xmath11 , it has been observed as a distinct peak ( see figs .",
    "this dip and peak behavior of the @xmath3 has also been seen in the brookhaven experiment on the reaction @xmath1 at @xmath18 gev [ 16 ] .",
    "a partial wave analysis of these data is presently being undertaken [ 16 ] .    in this work",
    "we show that the observed alteration of the s - wave @xmath0 mass spectrum in the reaction @xmath1 with increasing @xmath2 can be explained by the contribution of the @xmath4 reaction amplitude with quantum numbers of the @xmath5 regge pole in the @xmath6 channel .",
    "so far this amplitude has been very poorly studied experimentally .",
    "in fact , we suggest the following plausible scenario . at small @xmath2 , the reaction @xmath19 is dominated by the one - pion exchange mechanism , and the @xmath3 resonance manifests itself in the @xmath20 mass spectrum as a minimum ( @xmath21 denotes a @xmath22 system with the orbital angular momentum @xmath23 ) .",
    "however , the one - pion exchange contribution decreases very rapidly with @xmath2 ( as is known , at least @xmath24 of the one - pion exchange cross section for the reactions @xmath14 originate from the region @xmath12 gev@xmath11 ) .",
    "the most remarkable fact is that the reactions @xmath25 at high energies involve only two types of @xmath26-channel exchanges , namely , those with quantum numbers of the @xmath27 and @xmath5 regge poles .",
    "thus , it is very probable that the reaction @xmath28 at large @xmath2 is dominated by the @xmath5 exchange , and that the @xmath3 resonance produced by this mechanism shows itself as a peak .",
    "notice that a similar manifestation of the @xmath3 resonance has been observed in many reactions not involving @xmath27 exchange ( i.e. , in which the @xmath29 interaction in the initial state is absent ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath30 resonance has been seen as a clear peak in the two - pion mass spectra in the reaction @xmath1 near threshold and for @xmath2 from 0.33 to 0.83 gev@xmath11 , where the one - pion exchange is small [ 17 ] , in the reaction @xmath31 at 13 gev [ 18 ] , in the @xmath32 [ 19 ] and @xmath33 [ 20 ] decays , in the reaction @xmath34 [ 21 ] , and also in the inclusive @xmath35 production in @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 [ 22 ] , and @xmath39 [ 23 ] collisions .",
    "our explanation of the gams results may be unambiguously verified experimentally in the reactions @xmath14 on polarized targets because this makes possible direct measurements of the interference between the @xmath40 and @xmath5 exchange amplitudes . in a cross section summed over the nucleon polarizations ,",
    "the contributions of these amplitudes are noncoherent and , generally speaking , they can not be separated without additional assumptions .",
    "it is interesting to note in this connection that the gams collaboration has probably become the first who succeeded in discovering a nontrivial evidence for the @xmath5 exchange mechanism in the reaction @xmath41 on an unpolarized target . on polarized targets",
    "are indicative of the @xmath5 exchange mechanism most definitely in the case of the @xmath42 production [ 24 - 26 ] . however , in the @xmath22 invariant mass region around 1 gev , rather large experimental uncertainties in the available data present considerable problems for certain conclusions . nevertheless , in a new analysis of the @xmath43 data at 17.2 gev [ 6,25 ] , which has been performed very recently in ref .",
    "[ 27 ] , one emphasizes that the @xmath5 exchange amplitude can not be neglected especially around 1 and 1.5 gev . ]    in sec .",
    "ii , we perform a simultaneous description of the gams data on the reaction @xmath19 [ 1 ] and the cern - munich data on the s - wave @xmath22 scattering in an invariant mass region around 1 gev [ 5 ] .",
    "we consider three simple parametrizations of the s - wave @xmath16 reaction amplitude . as to the corresponding amplitude of the reaction @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 denotes a reggeized pion ) ,",
    "it is constructed by using the @xmath6 dependence factorization assumption which was extensively applied previously to obtain the @xmath22 scattering data ( see , for example , refs .",
    "[ 5,7,8,27 - 29 ] ) . in parametrizing the @xmath46 reaction amplitude due to the @xmath5 exchange , we use the above qualitative reason based on the observations of the @xmath3 resonance in the reactions not involving @xmath27 exchange .",
    "all considered parametrizations of the @xmath19 reaction amplitudes give similar results and , on the whole , quite reasonable fits to the gams data . in sec .",
    "iii , we compare our explanation of the gams data with that reported previously in ref . [ 30 ] and point out two direct ways to test these explanations .",
    "the explanation of ref .",
    "[ 30 ] differs crucially from ours in that it is based entirely on one - pion exchange or exchanges with these quantum numbers .",
    "such a restriction , as we show , leads , in particular , to rather exotic predictions for the @xmath6 distributions of the @xmath19 events .",
    "our conclusions are briefly summarized in sec .",
    "we shall consider the reaction @xmath19 within the framework of the simplest regge pole model and write the unpolarized differential distribution of the @xmath19 events at fixed @xmath50 in the following form : @xmath51 + \\left|\\,a_{a_1}\\ ( 1+t\\,c)\\ e^{\\tilde b_{a_1}t/2}\\ i\\ e^{-i\\pi\\alpha_{a_1}(t)/2}\\ \\,\\sqrt{m}\\ \\,r_{a_1\\pi\\to\\pi\\pi}(m , t)\\,\\right|^ 2\\ .\\,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the first and second terms correspond to the @xmath27 and @xmath5 regge pole contributions , respectively ( the @xmath27 and @xmath5 exchanges do not interfere because , at high energies , they contribute to different helicity amplitudes ) , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the trajectories of these poles , @xmath54 is the invariant mass of the final @xmath22 system , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the normalization constants , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the s - wave amplitudes for the subprocesses @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , @xmath61 , the slope @xmath62gev@xmath63 , i.e. , it incorporates the slope of the reggeized pion propagator and the slope of the @xmath64 residue taken in the exponential form , and the slope @xmath65 has a similar structure . according to the physical reasons which were discussed in the literature , the @xmath5 regge pole amplitude has to have the so - called sense - nonsense wrong signature zero at @xmath66 , and hence , to be proportional to @xmath67 ( see , for example , refs .",
    "[ 31 - 33 ] ) .",
    "thus , the factor @xmath68 in the second term of eq .",

    "the amplitude @xmath78 is assumed negligible .",
    "now we suppose that the @xmath6 dependences of the amplitudes @xmath79 for the reaction @xmath76 can be extracted in the form of overall exponential form factors .",
    "thus we put @xmath80 where the amplitudes @xmath81 and @xmath82 depend only on @xmath54 and are determined by the on - mass - shell dynamics of the @xmath22 scattering .",
    "this assumption about the @xmath6 dependence factorization , together with the concrete shape of this dependence , was widely used as a simple working tool to obtain the @xmath22 scattering data and gave results which were in close agreement with those of the more general chew - low extrapolation method [ 3 - 13,27 - 29 ] . and",
    "@xmath83 resonances produced in the reactions @xmath14 in the low @xmath2 region via the one - pion exchange , the factorization of the @xmath6 and @xmath54 dependences for the @xmath84 and @xmath85 amplitudes is quite natural .",
    "however , in the s - wave case , the situation is more complicated .",
    "there are at least two strongly interfering contributions in the @xmath86 @xmath76 channel at @xmath87 gev , namely , the narrow @xmath88 resonance and the smooth large background which can be parametrized , for example , in terms of a broad elastic @xmath22 resonance [ 34,35 ] .",
    "even though the @xmath6 dependence factorizes for each contribution , the whole @xmath86 @xmath76 amplitude may possess this property only if the various contributions have rather close @xmath6 dependence . in connection with the gams results ,",
    "we discuss the @xmath86 @xmath76 amplitude in the region of the @xmath3 resonance beyond the @xmath6 dependence factorization assumption at the end of this section and also in sec .",

    "hence , according to such an approach , the @xmath6 dependence of the amplitude @xmath233 must not factorize at @xmath87 gev even in the low @xmath2 region . in ref . [ 30 ] , the following parametrization for the residues @xmath235 and @xmath247 was postulated : @xmath248\\",
    ", \\qquad i=1,\\,2\\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the best fit @xmath249 gev , @xmath250 , @xmath251 gev , and @xmath252 [ 30 ] .",
    "as is seen , the residue @xmath235 vanishes at @xmath253 gev@xmath254 , and as @xmath2 varies from 0 to 1 gev@xmath11 , the functions @xmath255 and @xmath256 increase , respectively , by approximately factors of 22000 and 6000 .",
    "in order to compensate this enormous rise , the authors of ref .",
    "[ 30 ] multiplied the @xmath19 one - pion exchange amplitude by the overall form factor @xmath257 ^ 4 $ ] with @xmath258 gev@xmath11 which , however , they ascribed , for unknown reasons , to the nucleon vertex .",
    "[ 6,42 ] using such a form factor in the @xmath259 vertex it would be necessary to introduce a @xmath260 residue which increases with @xmath2 . in turn , this would lead to a rise of @xmath261 for the process @xmath262 .",
    "it is evident that such a picture is incompatible with conventional ideas . also , according to eq .",
    "( 17 ) , we face a similar problem for the reaction @xmath263 . furthermore , the above form factor would yield an abnormally sharp drop of the one - pion exchange contribution to the differential cross section of the charge exchange reaction @xmath264 . ] as a result , they obtained formally a very good description of the gams data on the @xmath47 mass spectra . recall that these spectra ( @xmath265 ) correspond to the distribution @xmath266 integrated over @xmath6 in the intervals indicated in figs .",
    "nevertheless , a detailed analysis shows that the model of ref . [ 30 ] predicts rather exotic @xmath6 distributions of the @xmath41 events for @xmath12 gev@xmath11 .",
    "figure 5 shows the unnormalized @xmath6 distributions @xmath267 for three @xmath54 intervals @xmath268 gev , @xmath269 gev , and @xmath270 gev which we obtained using the formulae from ref . [",
    "the most discouraging feature of the presented picture is a dip in @xmath271 whose location depends on @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , this is a straightforward consequence of a failure of the factorization for the amplitude @xmath233 .",
    "the @xmath6 distribution for @xmath268 has a dip at @xmath272 gev@xmath11 and , as is seen from fig . 5 , changes very rapidly in the region @xmath12 gev@xmath11 . with increasing @xmath54 , a dip in @xmath271 moves to @xmath273",
    "so , the @xmath6 distribution for @xmath269 gev has a dip at @xmath274 gev@xmath11 . for the mass interval @xmath270 gev which already belongs to the inelastic region of the reaction @xmath76 ,",
    "a dip in @xmath271 disappears . a comparison of the predictions for @xmath271 shown in figs .",
    "4 and 5 shows that the choice between our explanation of the gams data and the explanation given by the authors of ref . [ 30 ] can be easily realized experimentally . to do this , it is sufficient to have data on @xmath271 in the region @xmath12",
    "gev@xmath11 for the @xmath54 intervals @xmath268 gev and @xmath275 gev . so far , however , neither the gams collaboration [ 1 ] nor the e852 collaboration [ 16 ] have published the data on the @xmath6 distributions .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that the best experimental test that we know of for the @xmath276 reaction mechanisms are measurements on polarized targets , because they will permit the interference to be directly observed between the @xmath27 and @xmath5 exchange amplitudes .",
    "as is known [ 24,25 ] , in such experiments one can measure the triple distribution ( in @xmath54 , @xmath6 , and @xmath277 ) which at fixed @xmath50 has the form @xmath278 where @xmath277 is the angle between the normal to the reaction plane and the ( transverse ) proton polarization @xmath279 . the first term in eq .",
    "( 18 ) corresponds to the distribution of events on an unpolarized target .",
    "it can be presented as @xmath280 , where @xmath281 and @xmath282 are the @xmath283-channel helicity amplitudes with and without nucleon helicity flip , due to the @xmath27 and @xmath5 exchange mechanisms , respectively .",
    "the second term in eq . ( 18 ) describes the nucleon polarization effects .",
    "the function @xmath284 in this term is stipulated by the interference between the @xmath27 and @xmath5 exchange amplitudes and has the form : @xmath285 $ ] . in our model for the reaction @xmath19 the amplitude @xmath286 ( and respectively , @xmath287 ) is given by the expression under the sign of modulus square in the first ( second ) term of eq .",
    "if one neglects the @xmath106 @xmath22 s - wave contribution , then the phase of the product @xmath288 in the elastic region ( i.e. for @xmath289 ) would be completely defined by the regge signature factors of the @xmath290 and @xmath282 amplitudes . with these provisos in mind , one can easily write the function @xmath284 in an explicit form for the three considered variants .",
    "for example , for the most simple variant 1 , up to a sign , @xmath291\\times \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",
    "\\   \\nonumber\\\\[3pt ] \\times\\ \\frac { 1}{2\\pi}\\ \\left[a_\\pi\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{-t}}{t - m^2_\\pi}\\ e^{b^0_\\pi(t - m^2_\\pi ) } \\ a_{a_1}\\ ( 1+tc)\\ e^{b^0_{a_1}t}\\right]\\left\\{\\sin(\\delta^0_0)\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{m \\gamma_{f_0\\pi\\pi}(m)}}{|d_{f_0}(m)|}\\right\\}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , as seen , the @xmath6 and @xmath54 dependences factorize .",
    "it is natural that the pure one - pion exchange model [ 30 ] predicts @xmath292 .",
    "we have suggested a new explanation of the gams results on the @xmath3 production in the reaction @xmath1 . a crucial role in our explanation",
    "is assigned to the amplitude with quantum numbers of the @xmath5 regge pole in the @xmath6 channel which is as of yet poorly studied .",
    "moreover , we consistently used the standard assumption of the @xmath6 dependence factorization . on the other hand , if one attempts to explain the gams data in the framework of the pure one - pion exchange model , as is done , for example , in ref . [ 30 ] , then this assumption must be rejected from the outset . to test the correctness of our explanation ,",
    "the data on the @xmath6 distributions of the @xmath293 events in the intervals @xmath268 gev and @xmath294 gev , and the measurements of the reaction @xmath295 on polarized targets , which can clearly demonstrate the presence of the @xmath5 exchange mechanism , are needed .",
    "recently we have shown [ 43 ] that the new data on @xmath296 can be explained within the framework of the regge pole model only if the reaction @xmath297 is dominated by the @xmath298 regge pole whose partner by exchange degeneracy is the @xmath5 regge pole . to all appearance ,",
    "the time is right to study the pseudovector and pseudotensor regge exchanges .",
