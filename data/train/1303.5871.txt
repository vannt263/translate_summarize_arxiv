    "heavy fermion ( hf ) systems are characterized by a delicate interplay of localized and itinerant electronic degrees of freedom that is responsible for a myriad of interesting strongly correlated electron phenomena@xcite . here the localized @xmath7-electrons of ce , pr , yb and various 5@xmath7 elements embedded in an intermetallic compound hybridize with the conduction electrons@xcite .",
    "the physics of the dilute limit of a single @xmath7-electron impurity in a metallic host is well - understood and described by the single - ion kondo problem , where below the single ion kondo temperature  the spins of the conduction electrons quench the local magnetic moment of the impurity via the kondo interaction @xcite .",
    "hf compounds represent the dense limit where the @xmath7-electron elements are arranged on a lattice , and in turn their local magnetic moments are mutually coupled through the conduction electrons by means of the ruderman - kittel - kasayu - yosida ( rkky ) interaction .",
    "the competition@xcite between rkky and kondo interactions is often summarized in a generic phase diagram for hf materials . on one end",
    "the rkky interaction leads to the development of long - range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order . on the other end",
    "the kondo interaction drives the demagnetization of the @xmath7-electron state , resulting in a paramagnetic hf state in which the entire lattice of @xmath7-electron moments collectively undergoes the kondo effect and the @xmath7-electrons are delocalized into the conduction band @xcite .",
    "the competing interactions can frequently be tuned by a non - thermal control parameter such as chemical composition @xmath0 , pressure @xmath8 or magnetic fields @xmath9 . a magnetic quantum critical point ( qcp )",
    "is observed when the magnetic critical temperature is suppressed to zero .",
    "magnetic qcps in hf compounds have continuously attracted scientific interest because in their vicinity the fermi - liquid paradigm is observed to break down@xcite , frequently accompanied by the emergence of unconventional superconductivity ( sc )  @xcite .",
    "both phenomena originate from the abundance of soft magnetic quantum fluctuations at the qcp , which in the latter case are believed to provide the pairing `` glue '' for the sc@xcite .",
    "in particular , the family of tetragonal `` 115 '' systems has been investigated in great detail in order to disentangle the complex interplay between the heavy fermion state , unconventional sc and quantum criticality .",
    "the most prominent member of this class is  @xcite .",
    "evinces superconductivity below a critical temperature @xmath10 2.3 k , and is thought to be situated on the brink of an afm qcp .",
    "this is reflected in the @xmath11-linear low - temperature electrical resistivity that indicates the presence of afm quantum critical fluctuations @xcite .",
    "here magnetically mediated sc is supported by the observation of a strong spin - resonance in neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "apart from the scing state , also the heavy normal state and non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) properties of  have been studied extensively by tuning the system via rare earth substitution on the ce site .",
    "notably , an analysis of transport data for ce@xmath12la@xmath13coin@xmath14 introduced the notion of a coherence temperature  @xmath3 45 k below which f - electron delocalization is supposed to proceed @xcite .",
    "further , for ce@xmath15coin@xmath16 it was found that both cooper pair breaking and kondo - lattice coherence are uniformly influenced by magnetic and nonmagnetic rare earth ( @xmath17 ) substituents .",
    "in contrast , the nfl behavior is strongly dependent on the @xmath7-electron configuration of the @xmath17 ions @xcite .",
    "a more recent study suggests that the introduction of small amounts of non - magnetic impurities on the ce ( y , la , yb , th ) and in ( hg , sn ) site generates an inhomogeneous electronic state , in which the periodicity of the kondo lattice is disrupted by the impurities @xcite .",
    "this additionally results in a rapid local suppression of unconventional superconductivity .",
    "these prior results can be contrasted with the properties of a new alloy series  for 0  @xmath2  @xmath0  @xmath21 that may provide a fresh view on both the normal and the scing state in hf compounds@xcite .",
    "notably , it was found that the coherence temperature , identified via the low - temperature electrical resistivity maximum , is essentially constant over the entire substitution range @xcite .",
    "this is surprising by itself , but taking into account that the single ion kondo temperatures  for  and  differ ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , it also contradicts a recent study that suggests that  and  generally scale with each other @xcite . the apparent stability of the electronic state is also reflected in the lattice parameters that remain nearly constant for @xmath0  @xmath2  0.775 , after which phase separation into yb rich and deficient phases of  occurs .",
    "also the magnetic susceptibility is almost unaffected by the substitution of ce with yb .",
    "the scing critical temperature  decreases linearly with @xmath0 towards 0 k as @xmath0 @xmath18 1 , in contrast with other hf superconductors where  scales with  ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . only the low - temperature nfl behavior derived from the electrical resistivity , specific",
    "heat and magnetic susceptibility varies with @xmath0 , even though there is no readily identifiable quantum critical point .",
    "two different hypotheses have been put forward to explain the remarkable behavior of .",
    "based on the robustness of  and , and most of all the agreement of the observed nfl behavior with the presence of critical valence fluctuations , shu _",
    "et al . _ have proposed a correlated electron state having cooperative valence fluctuations of yb and ce @xcite . on the other hand , booth _",
    "_ @xcite suggested from exafs measurements that below the yb concentration where macroscopic phase separation takes place there is nonetheless a high degree of inhomogeneity in the form of large coexisting interlaced networks of  and .",
    "it was argued that the  network would locally influence the physical properties of , causing the slow suppression of .",
    "but it seems that one could equally well imagine that the consequence of such large networks could be an unchanging value of  because the  and  networks would only influence each other at their respective surfaces .",
    "in that case , one would expect the  in the  network remains constant as function of yb concentration , while the superconducting volume fraction for the entire sample would decrease .",
    "we also note that for the samples studied by booth _",
    "a change in the distances of nearest neighbor ions has been observed for @xmath0 ~ 0.4 using exafs .",
    "this may be interpreted as a local precursor of the macroscopic phase separation that has been observed by shu _",
    "et al . _ at @xmath0 ~ 0.8 .",
    "the implications of recent thin film studies are unclear for the issue of homogeneity .",
    "it was found for epitaxial superlattices of /  @xcite that  is suppressed by @xmath0 ~ 0.2 , essentially like the behavior for other ( @xmath17 ) substituents . for thin films of  @xcite",
    "is suppressed by @xmath0 ~ 0.4 , which is , on the one hand , smaller than for bulk crystals , but on the other hand , still larger than for other ( @xmath17 ) substituents",
    ". one possible interpretation could be that the films are more homogeneous than the bulk crystals and thus show  suppression more quickly .",
    "but the more likely possibility is that the thin films constitute an essentially different materials system from the bulk crystals , e.g. , owing to the effect of the interaction of the film with the substrate . for the thin films of  it",
    "was found @xcite that the in - plane lattice parameter is expanded slightly because it is in registry with the substrate and does not change with @xmath0 , whereas the out - of - plane lattice parameter varies linearly with @xmath0 between the values for  and , quite different from the behavior of the bulk crystals .",
    "the comparison of thin films to bulk crystals is further complicated by the recent finding that thin films are extremely sensitive to air and degrade quickly upon exposure @xcite .    both hypotheses , the cooperative valence fluctuations as well as the coexisting interlaced networks , have interesting implications and justify a more detailed microscopic investigation of the electronic structure , and in particular the ce and yb valences .",
    "the possibility of critical valence fluctuations within an extended scing phase is remarkable in the context of recent studies in which cerhin@xmath14  @xcite and cecu@xmath19si@xmath19  @xcite were suggested as candidates for valence - fluctuation mediated sc .",
    "further a recent study of the transport properties of cerhin@xmath14 under hydrostatic pressure found that scattering of the charge carriers near the afm qcp is isotropic , in contrast to expectations for a classical afm qcp .",
    "this finding was interpreted as a signature of coexisting critical degrees of freedom in both spin and charge channels @xcite that could be a source of sc pairing . on the other hand sc in interlaced networks of  and  is of interest in view of a current proposal that unconventional scs in the vicinity of afm may be generally electronically textured @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath0-dependence of has been addressed in a recent theoretical work which demonstrates that the onset of coherence is strongly affected by the degree of correlations between impurity sites @xcite .      with the proposal of cooperative valence fluctuations , the @xmath0-dependencies of the ce and yb valences are of immediate interest .",
    "from spectroscopic information and analysis of bulk properties the @xmath0  @xmath10  0 compound is known to have essentially trivalent ce ( 4@xmath20 ) and the uncorrelated behavior of the @xmath0  @xmath10  1 compound might suggest divalent yb ( 4@xmath21 ) .",
    "but the picture of cooperative valence fluctuations in the alloy would require intermediate valence yb .",
    "this picture has been supported by a report from booth @xmath22 @xcite from x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) at the yb and ce l@xmath23 edges that the yb and ce valences are ~ 2.3 and ~ 3.1 , respectively . ref .",
    "also finds these valences to be essentially independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0  @xmath10  1 compound can then be interpreted@xcite as intermediate valence with the 4@xmath24 magnetic moment quenched on such a high energy scale  that curie weiss behavior can not be seen .",
    "was estimated in ref . to be larger than 6000 k.",
    "there are also important questions of electron counting and the implications for the volume contained by the fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "it must be kept in mind that if a local moment is quenched , e.g. , by the kondo effect , then the electrons producing the moment must be included in the fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "thus for ce@xmath25 with its magnetic moment kondo quenched , the fs volume is based on an atomic configuration [ xe]4@xmath205@xmath266@xmath27 having 4 delocalized electrons / ce , the same as if ce were formally ce@xmath28 [ xe]4@xmath295@xmath306@xmath27 . for de haas van alphen ( dhva )",
    "measurements @xcite at low temperatures have found that the 4@xmath7 electron is included in the fermi surface although angle resolved pes ( arpes ) performed at ~ 20k has found the fs expected in lda band calculations with the ce 4f electron confined to the core , i.e. [ xe][4@xmath20]5@xmath266@xmath27 with 3 electrons / ce going into the fs .",
    "analogously for yb@xmath25 with 4@xmath24 , if the magnetic moment of the 4@xmath7 hole is quenched , the fermi surface must contain the 4@xmath7 hole and so its volume will be the same as though yb were formally divalent [ xe][4@xmath21]6@xmath27 , i.e. , the fs volume would contain 2 electrons / yb . because of its large  this situation is expected up to very high temperatures for .",
    "thus , no matter whether or not the 4@xmath7 electron in  is localized at the measurement temperature , one expects that in comparing the @xmath0  @xmath10  1 and the @xmath0  @xmath10  0 compounds , characteristic hole fs features will tend to expand and characteristic electron fs features will tend to shrink with increasing x.    recent dhva experiments @xcite found that the fs of  is indeed much different from that of .",
    "the measured frequencies are in reasonable agreement with an lda calculation for , which gives an yb valence of 2.3 , the same as found in xas @xcite , and shows reduced volume relative to that of @xmath0  @xmath10  0 .",
    "for example the frequencies assigned to two prominent electron fs features centered on the m - a line in @xmath33-space and known as @xmath34 and @xmath5 from lda @xcite and dhva @xcite studies for @xmath0  @xmath10  0 , decrease markedly from @xmath0  @xmath10  0 to @xmath0  @xmath10  1 .",
    "it is also of note that the dhva effective masses for  are relatively small , in the range 1.0 @xmath35 to 1.5 @xmath35 .",
    "these small masses are consistent with the very large value of  implied @xcite by the yb valence of 2.3 . for @xmath0  @xmath10  0.1 ,",
    "the dhva frequencies and masses are unchanged from those of @xmath0  @xmath10  0 and for @xmath0  @xmath10  0.2 there appear frequencies characteristic of both @xmath0  @xmath10  0 and @xmath0  @xmath10  1 . for @xmath0",
    "@xmath10  0.55 , the next highest value for which dhva data were obtained , and for higher values",
    "@xmath0  @xmath10  0.85 and 0.95 , the frequencies and masses that could be observed are generally like those that are found for @xmath0  @xmath10  1 , with the @xmath34 frequencies essentially unchanged and the @xmath5 frequencies changing slightly .",
    "thus dhva shows a rather abrupt change of electronic structure around @xmath0  @xmath10  0.2 .",
    "in contrast , ref . reported from arpes that the electronic structure along the -m line is essentially invariant with @xmath0 , including @xmath0  @xmath10  1 .      in the present work",
    "we determine the ce valence from xas at the ce m@xmath36 edges and the yb valence from 4@xmath7 electron x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) . in agreement with ref . , we find that the ce valence is near 3 + and essentially independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the yb valence for @xmath0  @xmath10  1 and decreasing to ~ 0.3 is ~ 2.3 , also in agreement with the finding of ref . .",
    "but as @xmath0 decreases further and approaches 0 the valence increases to nearly 3 + .",
    "we also report and analyze the @xmath0-dependence of the alloy magnetic susceptibility for temperatures where it exhibits curie - weiss behavior , and we introduce a simple model to inter - relate the effective moment and the ce and yb valences . under the assumptions that kondo effects can be ignored and that the ce valence is essentially 3 + , we infer yb valences in very good agreement with the values found from xps , including their tendency to increase toward 3 + for small @xmath0",
    ". thus the rather abrupt change of electronic structure found in dhva can now be seen as resulting from a change of yb valence .",
    "we present the @xmath33-dependent electronic structure and fs of  and  throughout the brillouin zone as measured using variable photon energy arpes .",
    "in contrast to the results of ref .",
    "we find along the -m line a large difference of electronic structure for @xmath0  @xmath10  0 and @xmath0  @xmath10  1 .",
    "in particular the sizes of the @xmath34 and @xmath5 sheets decrease markedly from @xmath0  @xmath10  0 to @xmath0  @xmath10  1 , in good qualitative agreement with the general expectations from electron counting set forth above and with the dhva results @xcite .",
    "but in disagreement with dhva is the observation of a smaller , essentially proportionate , size change of the  sheet for @xmath6 0.2 .",
    "the somewhat columnar shapes of these fs features have drawn attention in connection with the idea that the layered crystal structure may be important for the sc of the @xmath0  @xmath10  0 compound .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the experimental details on the sample preparation , bulk property measurements and spectroscopic measurements are summarized in section  [ sec : expdetails ] .",
    "section  [ sec : spectroscopy ] presents the various spectroscopic studies and the data analysis used to determine the yb and ce valences . in section  [ sec : bulk ] we relate the ce and yb valences to the dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and the unit cell volume on the yb concentration @xmath0 .",

    "the heating schedule consisted of an initial ramp at 50  @xmath37c / hr to 1050  @xmath37c , a dwell at 1050  @xmath37c for 72 hours , and a two - stage cooling process to avoid forming crystals of cein@xmath38 @xmath39 first a rapid cooling from 1050  @xmath37c to 800  @xmath37c followed by a slow cool to 450  @xmath37c , where the excess flux was spun off in a centrifuge.@xcite the resulting crystals were characterized with x - ray powder diffraction ( xrd ) and energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) analysis in order to verify both the correct structure and composition .",

    "the measurements were performed with pressure between 8x10@xmath44 mbar and 1x10@xmath45 mbar .",
    "the samples were cleaved in situ by pushing against a post which was glued on the sample surface by epoxy adhesive .",
    "the cleavage temperature was between 20 k and 25 k , essentially equal to the measurement temperature , which was 25 k for   and 20k for  .",
    "the position of the fermi energy and the energy resolution were determined by measuring a gold foil adjacent to and in good thermoelectrical contact with the sample . before measuring ,",

    "although @xmath54 can vary considerably from the nominal composition @xmath55 , as described further below , nonetheless it is possible to find samples in which the two are similar and such samples were carefully selected for obtaining the susceptibility data reported here and in ref . .",
    "the xeds analysis for these samples was performed at the university of california at san diego .",
    "the xeds analysis of the samples used for the synchrotron electron spectroscopy was performed at the electron microbeam analysis laboratory at the university of michigan .",
    "since the synchrotron spectroscopy is performed with a small photon spot on a selected region of a cleaved surface the xeds analysis was performed after the synchrotron spectroscopy was done and great care was taken to obtain the composition at the same location on the sample as that where the synchrotron spectroscopy was performed . using the focused probe of the scanning electron microscope it is possible to determine the composition of the sample with a resolution of a few @xmath47 m ( the actual value depends on the average atomic number of the sample and the accelerating voltage of the microscope ( 30kv in this case ) ) . therefore by this method we can detect inhomogeneities on the micro - scale but not the nano - scale range .",
    "as the photon beam - spot for the synchrotron spectroscopy was much larger , roughly 50 - 100 @xmath47 m , we checked the micro - scale homogeneity by doing xeds analysis around the measured position , at two or three points roughly within a circle of 100 - 200 microns diameter .",

    "brighter color means higher photoelectron intensity .",
    "we then compare the xy - map with the scanning electron microscope image of the sample and identify the position where we performed the electron spectroscopy .",
    "this enables us to perform the xeds analysis at very much the same position .",
    "after obtaining the x - ray fluorescence spectrum , the composition analysis was performed by using the intensity of the in l - lines , the ce l - lines , the co k - lines and the yb - l lines .",
    "the first step is to perform a so - called `` standard - free '' analysis that determines the intensities of the multiple lines of the spectrum and then applies a correction in order to account for the deviations of the spectrum of a pure element relative to that of the element residing in the matrix of other elements such as in .",
    "we used the so - called zaf method @xcite .",
    "this method includes an atomic number correction ( z ) which estimates the backscattering and stopping power of the incident electron beam , an absorption correction ( a ) which corrects for absorption within the matrix , and a correction for fluorescence ( f ) within the matrix .",
    "the corrected spectroscopic intensities are then used to obtain relative elemental compositions subject to the constraint that there are 7 atoms per formula unit . for in and co compositions so obtained were typically near to the expected values of 5 and 1 , respectively , but with some outlier values that for in were at most 2.6% different from 5 .",
    "the magnitude of the maximum outlier discrepancy for the co concentration was somewhat less than that for the in composition , resulting in a maximum percentage deviation of 9% .",
    "we take these discrepancies as an indication of the uncertainties inherent in the technique .",

    "this agreement with independent results from two other techniques encourages us to have confidence in our procedure .",

    "the arpes frequencies have a similar pattern of variation in magnitude among the various orbits but are systematically smaller than those from dhva , a difference for which one can consider two contributing effects .",
    "the first is the difference in temperature of the two measurements , that low-@xmath11 dhva sees the `` large '' fs and that higher-@xmath11 arpes likely sees the `` small '' fs or at least a smaller fs .",
    "however dhva @xcite and lda @xcite studies find that the fractional differences occurring in the @xmath34 and @xmath5 sheets for the change from localized to itinerant ce f electrons in the ce 115 compounds are relatively small , so this effect may not be very important .",
    "second , even at the arpes measurement temperature the bands are still heavy enough very near  over the energy window of the fs maps that the  value for an electron pocket is likely to be underestimated . for @xmath0",
    "@xmath10  1 neither of these differences are important because the measurement temperatures for dhva and arpes are both much less than the characteristic temperature and the bands are light .",
    "indeed here we find much better quantitative agreeement between the two techniques .",
    "it should however be noted that for the @xmath34-sheet the good agreement is aided by assigning the measured dhva frequencies somewhat differently than in ref . .",
    "in that paper the four frequencies labeled @xmath67 through @xmath68 ( 1.8 kt , 2.04 kt , 2.19 kt and 2.96 kt , respectively ) are all associated with the @xmath34-sheet but @xmath69 is assigned to @xmath70 and @xmath68 is assigned to @xmath71 , leaving @xmath67 and @xmath72 to be assigned to the corregations predicted in lda between the @xmath73-plane and the z - plane . considering the shape of the lda @xmath34-sheet we find it more natural and in better agreement with arpes to assign @xmath69 as @xmath70 and @xmath68 as @xmath71 , with the other two belonging to the corregations .",
    "these reassigments are not inconsistent with the observed angular dependences of the orbits .",
    "table ii also lists values for the arpes fs areas for @xmath0  @xmath10  1 and @xmath0  @xmath10  0.2 relative to those for @xmath0  @xmath10  0 . for the @xmath73-plane ,",
    "the ratio between the @xmath34-sheet area in  compared to the area in  is 0.46 , while for the z - plane this ratio is 0.54 .",
    "from these data we would estimate that the average ratio of the volumes of the @xmath34-sheets is rougly 50% .",
    "we note that ref . also concluded a value of about 50% from the dhva data , but the combination of the larger dhva frequencies for @xmath0  @xmath10  0 and our changed orbit assignments for @xmath0  @xmath10  1 , as discussed in the preceding paragraph , causes the dhva data of table ii to imply a ratio somewhat smaller , perhaps 40% .",
    "the ratio of the volumes of the @xmath5-sheets is estimated to be about 50% from the arpes and dhva data . by the electron counting discussion in section  [ subsec : ecounting ]",
    ", one would expect for arpes the total fs volume of  compared to that of  to include 2 electrons / yb compared to 3 electrons / ce which results in a ratio of 66% , whereas for dhva the fs volume would change from including 2 electrons / yb to 4 electrons / ce which results in a ratio of 50% . considering the uncertainties discussed in the preceding paragraph , and that we can not expect any particular part of the fs to change in strict proportion to the change of the total , these findings are very consistent with the general expectations of simple electron counting .",
    "the significant finding for the arpes data for @xmath0  @xmath10  0.2 is that the @xmath34-sheet areas are , even by eye , intermediate between those for @xmath0  @xmath10  0 and @xmath0  @xmath10  1 .",
    "quantitatively the change in area from @xmath0  @xmath10  0 to @xmath0  @xmath10  0.2 is 21% and 14% of the change from @xmath0  @xmath10  0 to @xmath0  @xmath10  1 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively , i.e. roughly in the same proportion as the doping .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to compare this result with the dhva data for intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "although the frequency @xmath74 of the dhva data is very similar to that implied by the arpes data ( i.e. , 3.6 kt or 3.7 kt ) this association can not be made because @xmath74 has hardly any variation with x and in ref .",
    "is thought to be associated somehow with the @xmath5-sheet . indeed",
    "the dhva frequencies associated with the @xmath34-sheets and @xmath5-sheets of the end members @xmath0  @xmath10  0 and @xmath0  @xmath10  1 show only slight modification for intermediate @xmath0-values , quite different from the arpes finding here of a clear intermediate @xmath34-sheet size for an intermediate @xmath0-value .",
    "we have no hypothesis for this very great difference beyond the possibility of some sample difference for intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "there are three main new findings of this work for .",
    "first , for small values of @xmath0 increasing from 0 , the yb valence changes rapidly from being nearly trivalent to the value of 2.3 found previously for larger @xmath0 and for .",
    "second , we have directly observed a large reduction in the sizes of the columnar @xmath34 and @xmath5 fs features for @xmath0  @xmath10  1 relative to those for @xmath0  @xmath10  0 .",
    "as already noted , both of these findings are in very good agreement with dhva results @xcite . taken together , these results imply that around @xmath0  @xmath10  0.2 a change of yb valence drives a switch of the near  electronic structure from one characteristic of @xmath0  @xmath10  0 with some very heavy mass fs pieces to one characteristic of @xmath0  @xmath10  1 with yb valence around 2.3 , a very large yb  and small measured masses .",
    "third , for at least one intermediate @xmath0-value and one sheet ( @xmath34 ) , the fs has been found to evolve between that of the two end memebers .",
    "this third result contrasts quite sharply with the dhva results , in which the observed frequencies and masses do not evolve significantly with @xmath0 and change quickly from one to the other , with a mix of both being seen for @xmath0  @xmath10  0.2 .    what are the implications of these findings for understanding the transport properties ? regarding the two hypotheses mentioned in section  [ subsect : gentrans ] , that of cooperative valence fluctuations or coexisting networks of  and , the arpes results clearly favor the former , at least for the samples used in this study .",
    "the addition of only a small amount of yb drives an overall change in the fs and near  electronic structure , and there appear to be unified electronic structures presumably involving the f - states of both ce and yb . on the other hand",
    "the dhva results lead to a different conclusion .",
    "the finding there of aspects of both electronic structures at @xmath0  @xmath10  0.2 suggests some coexistence .",
    "further it is very puzzling that the observed dhva frequencies , e.g. , for the @xmath34 orbits , do not change as @xmath0 increases beyond 0.2 , given that the fs size changes appear to be driven by simple electron counting and that the total number of electrons to be contained in the fs per rare earth atom certainly changes steadily .",
    "also , as noted in ref . , the switch to a fs with only low mass measured features is inconsistent with the finding that the specific heat is roughly constant with @xmath0 .",
    "this issue gave rise to the conclusion @xcite that there must be heavy fs pieces for larger @xmath0 not yet observed in dhva , possibly the heavier @xmath5 orbits that were not observed for @xmath0  @xmath10  0.2 and 0.55 .",
    "the change in transport properties across the crystallographically two - phase region between @xmath0  @xmath10  0.8 and @xmath0  @xmath10  1 also bears thought .",
    "the absence of kondo - like features in the resistivity for @xmath0  @xmath10  1 is readily understandable from the yb valence of 2.3 , the implied large  and the low dhva masses .",
    "but the presence of these features for @xmath0  @xmath10  0.8 , very similar to those for @xmath0  @xmath10  0 , plus the lack of any yb valence change across the region , implies that the resistivity is due only to the ce and that the change is simply the result of removing all the ce from the lattice . in this respect",
    "the ce would seem to be acting independently of the yb .    what is the role of the ce and yb for the sc ?",
    "that  decreases only slowly and gradually with @xmath0 implies a gradual steady change of some essential ingredients for the sc and it is again tempting to think of ce and yb as acting independently .",
    "one possibility is that ce brings a local moment which is essential for the sc . in this picture",
    "the smallness of the ce  is a benefit , and yb , with the largeness of its does no direct harm but does serve to dilute the ce . another model involving ce as the essential active ingredient perhaps being diluted by yb is the composite pairing picture @xcite . moving away from local pictures ,",
    "if low dimensionality is involved in the sc , as has been suggested for pairing involving spin fluctuations , then the particulars of the columnar pieces of fs might be important .",
    "the changing sizes of these pieces with @xmath0 in the arpes data ( but not the dhva data ) would be consistent with this idea .    in conclusion ,",
    "while good progress has been made in determining the electronic structure of this interesting new alloy series , it remains to find a unified view that explains both what is now known about the electronic properties and what is known about the transport properties .",
    "one step forward for the future would be to obtain a complete set of arpes data for intermediate values of @xmath0 , ideally having the same high quality as that reported here for @xmath0  @xmath10  0 and @xmath0  @xmath10  1 .",
