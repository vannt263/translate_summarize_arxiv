    "et al_. @xcite and simha and ramaswamy @xcite , active matter research has blossomed to encompass diverse systems and scales ranging from animal groups to subcellular matter @xcite .",
    "because active particles typically have elongated shapes , their collective behavior has been often described using the language of liquid crystals @xcite . in this regard , an important distinction among active particles concerns the possibility of forming phases characterized by nematic or polar order . while all elongated particles can form a nematic phase at sufficient densities and levels of activity , particles which have an asymmetry associated with their mutual interaction",
    "can additionally form a phase characterized by a non - zero macroscopic polarization .",
    "active particles can also be distinguished in terms of their locomotion characteristics : self - propelled particles ( spp ) are endowed with an internal engine and , typically but not necessarily , with appendages that allow them to swim in a fluid or crawl on a substrate .",
    "for example , bacteria @xcite , large animals such as fish or birds @xcite , and catalytic motors @xcite belong in this category .",
    "cytoskeletal filaments , on the other hand , can not propel themselves , but move in a solvent through the action of motor proteins , which are themselves powered by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) .",
    "bundles of molecular motors attach to pairs of filaments and , during an atp cycle , slide the filaments with respect to each other .",
    "we will refer to this type of active elements as mutually - propelled particles ( mpp ) .",
    "there is finally a third class of systems in which activity is provided through vibration .",
    "vertically shaken granular rods , for instance , gain and dissipate energy while bouncing on a substrate , resulting in a two - dimensional motion along their major axis @xcite .",
    "most theoretical effort in modeling active systems characterized by liquid crystalline order has focused on constructing hydrodynamic equations that , in addition to the usual liquid crystalline elasticity , can account for the additional forces and currents originated from the activity .",
    "this task has been achieved by incorporating phenomenological non - equilibrium terms in the hydrodynamic equations of nematic and polar liquid crystals @xcite or by applying the tools of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics to specific microscopic models @xcite .",
    "this program has generated a variety of predictions , which include the existence of _ giant _ density fluctuations in active nematics @xcite , spontaneously flowing states @xcite , unconventional rheological properties @xcite and a plethora of a novel hydrodynamic instabilities with no counterpart in passive complex fluids @xcite ; a recent overview can be found in @xcite .    in spite of the vast theoretical work on _ active liquid crystals _ , little consideration has been given to the possibility of spatial and temporal variations in the order parameter ; a recent exception is the work of mishra _",
    "et al_. @xcite who considered self - propelled polar rods moving on a frictional substrate , with a density - driven mean field transition from the isotropic to the polar phase and showed that when the self - propulsion velocity exceeds a threshold value , the uniformly polarized moving state becomes unstable to spatial fluctuations which organize into stripes of different density and polarization .    here",
    "we consider the case of an active nematic suspension motivated by the observation of highly unstable flowing states in assemblies of microtubules and kinesin @xcite , a model for mutually - propelled elongated particles in a solvent .",
    "the system undergoes a mean - field isotropic - nematic transition for large enough filament concentrations and the nematic order parameter is allowed to vary in space and time .",
    "we use stability analysis and numerical simulations to analyze the model in two geometries : a quasi - one - dimensional channel with no - slip walls and a two - dimensional box with periodic boundaries . in the channel geometry ,",
    "moderate activity levels lead to spontaneous laminar flow , as seen in earlier works @xcite that assumed a constant magnitude of the nematic order parameter . upon increasing the activity past a threshold value , however , fluctuations in magnitude of the nematic order parameter leads to oscillatory flow in which the nematic director periodically switches orientation .",
    "in the two - dimensional box , the interplay between non - uniform nematic order , activity , and flow results in a variety of complex scenarios that include spontaneous laminar flow , relaxation oscillations reminiscent of excitable media , and chaos . a detailed analysis allows us to uncover the origin of oscillations in the system and characterize the chaotic regime , wherein we see behavior consistent with turbulent flow even in the low reynolds number regime , expanding on and complementing a recent short report of some of our findings @xcite .",

    "a fluid of orientable fore - aft symmetric particles can generally exist in two phases : isotropic ( i ) and nematic ( n ) . in the latter phase ,",
    "the particles are orientationally ordered with an average orientation characterized by the nematic director field @xmath0 . for microscopic particles in suspension , such as colloidal rods or biological filaments ,",
    "the in transition is driven by density : when the concentration of particles overcomes some critical value @xmath1 , the particles form a nematic phase in order to maximize entropy . in a two - dimensional _ equilibrium _ fluid of slender rods",
    "the critical concentration is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the length of the rods @xcite and the phase transition is of the kosterlitz - thouless type .",
    "the anisotropy of a nematic phase is expressed through the nematic tensor @xmath4 @xcite , which for uniaxial nematics reads : @xmath5 the nematic tensor @xmath4 is by construction traceless and symmetric , thus in @xmath6 it consists of only two independent degrees of freedom .",
    "the nematic phase has orientational order ( @xmath7 ) and is invariant under inversion of the director field : @xmath8 . here",
    "the extent of nematic alignment is expressed in terms of a scalar nematic order - parameter @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the axis of the molecules , @xmath12 is the dimension of the system and the angular brackets denote a thermal average . in a suspension of rod - like particles , @xmath9 depends on the local concentration of the particles and , in equilibrium passive systems , is constant across the sample since diffusion drives the fluid toward a homogeneous state . in active systems , however , activity can build up density inhomogeneities and the order parameter may exhibit spatial fluctuations . moreover , since the effects of activity are generally enhanced by local orientational order , coupling between order , activity and flow can amplify these fluctuations . in the following",
    "we describe a set of hydrodynamic equations suitable to describe a suspension of active particles whose nematic order is allowed to vary in space and time as a consequence of activity and flow .",
    "let us consider a concentration @xmath13 of rod - like active particles of length @xmath3 and mass @xmath14 suspended in a solvent of concentration @xmath15 .",
    "the total density of the system @xmath16 is conserved and the fluid is incompressible . since the total number of particles is also constant , the concentration @xmath13 obeys a continuity equation of the form : @xmath17\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the bulk flow velocity , @xmath19 is the velocity at which the particles actively move relative to the flow , and @xmath20 is the diffusion tensor , which two - dimensional uniaxial nematics reads : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the bare diffusion coefficients along the parallel and perpendicular directions of the director field . the active current @xmath26 has been modeled in different ways and depends on whether the system is in a nematic or polar phase . in polar systems , active particles",
    "are collectively propelled in the direction of the macroscopic polarization @xmath27 ; thus @xmath28 with @xmath29 the average velocity of an individual active particle .",
    "thus , for example , for bacterial suspensions @xmath29 is constant and represents the average swimming velocity of an individual bacterium @xcite , while for mutually propelled particles , such as cytoskeletal filaments pushing against each other through the action of motor clusters , @xmath29 depends on the average concentration of the filaments .",
    "thus @xmath30 with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the propulsion velocity for unit concentration and is proportional to the rate of atp consumption .",
    "this leads to an active current of the form @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "an example of the active currents resulting from eq . in the presence of large distortions of the director field , such as those which occur near a disclination . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the tilt in the director field surrounding a @xmath34 disclination ( left ) results in a collective drift of particles in the direction indicated by the red arrows ( i.e. toward the `` nose '' of the defect ) . on the other hand",
    ", a @xmath35 disclination ( right ) will produce the same amount of incoming and outgoing currents and thus zero net flux . ]    for a nematic suspension , on the other hand , the active particles move along @xmath0 and @xmath36 at the same rate ; thus if the director field is uniform across the system , there will be no net flux of particles across an arbitrarily small domain and @xmath37 .",
    "however , in the presence of a non - uniform director field or equivalently a non - uniform nematic order parameter , there will be regions of fluid moving faster than others and thus a current .",
    "such a current must depend on the derivatives of the nematic tensor rather than on @xmath4 itself .",
    "the simplest term of this type with the correct tensorial structure is given by @xmath38 , which for mutually propelled particles gives a current:@xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant with dimensions of inverse time .",
    "the negative sign in eq .",
    "reflects the fact that the flux of active particles is directed from regions populated by fast moving particles to regions of slow moving particles .",
    "the active current @xmath41 has been derived in the form by ahmadi _",
    "et al_. starting from a microscopic model of filaments interacting through a motor cluster @xcite and later by lau and lubensky for swimming bacteria @xcite ( the dependence on the concentration @xmath13 is different in the latter case because of the different microscopic model ) . ramaswamy and coworkers argued that such active currents are responsible for the existence of _ giant _ fluctuations in the number density of active nematic particles in the presence of noise @xcite .",
    "since spatial variations of the order parameter were neglected in that work , the only driving force for active currents arose from curvature ( i.e. tilt ) in the director field orientation , hence the name `` curvature - induced currents '' coined in @xcite . here",
    "we show that a more complete description , in which both the orientation of the director field and the nematic order parameter are allowed to vary , leads to additional complex phenomena .",
    "next we construct a set of hydrodynamic equations for the nematic tensor @xmath4 .",
    "these can be written in the generic form : @xmath42q_{ij } = \\omega_{ij}^{(r)}+\\omega_{ij}^{(v)}+\\omega_{ij}^{(a)}\\,,\\ ] ] where the rates @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 embody respectively the relaxational dynamics , the coupling with the flow , and the active contribution to the dynamics of the nematic tensor . following olmsted and goldbart @xcite , the rates on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "can be obtained phenomenologically by constructing all possible traceless - symmetric combinations of the relevant fields of the theory .",

    "is driven by the molecular tensor @xmath62 : @xmath63\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is a type of rotational viscosity .",
    "the coupling between nematic order and flow is found by constructing all possible symmetric traceless tensors from the products of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath4 @xcite .",

    "here @xmath73 is the flow - aligning parameter which dictates how the director field rotates in a shear flow . in passive liquid crystals , for @xmath74 , the director tends to align to the flow direction at an angle @xmath75 such that @xmath76 , while for @xmath77 , it forms rolls across the system .",
    "these regimes are known as `` flow aligning '' and `` flow tumbling '' respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath73 has even greater significance in active systems ; together with the magnitude of forces exerted by the active particles it dramatically influences the flow behavior and rheological properties of the system @xcite .    the active contribution to the dynamics of the nematic tensor",
    "was derived by ahamadi _",
    "et al_. @xcite and is directly proportional to the nematic tensor @xmath78 however , given the structure of eqs . and ,",
    "such a term can be simply incorporated into the molecular field , leading to a redefinition of the critical concentration @xmath1 . here",
    "we will drop this explicit dependence for sake of brevity , but remember that that the critical concentration @xmath1 associated with the in transition does depend on the activity .",
    "the corresponding reactive stress tensor can be obtained from eqs . , and using the standard energy conservation and entropy production argument ( see , for example , ref .",
    "this gives , after some algebra : @xmath79 finally the flow velocity obeys the navier - stokes equation , with the total stress tensor given by : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is fluid viscosity of the fluid and @xmath82 the pressure .",
    "the last term was established in the seminal work of pedley and kessler @xcite and represents the tensile / contractile stress exerted by the active particles in the direction of the director field @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath83 dependence again arises because the propulsion , in our analysis , is provided by pair interactions of the filaments through motors",

    "summarizing , the hydrodynamics of an incompressible nematic suspension of mutually propelled filaments is governed by the following set of differential equations for the particle concentration @xmath13 , the nematic tensor @xmath4 , and the flow velocity @xmath18 ( with components @xmath84 ) : @xmath85 [ \\partial_{t}+{v_i } \\partial_i ] c = \\partial_{i}[(d_{0}\\delta_{ij}+d_{1}q_{ij})\\partial_{j}c+\\alpha_{1}c^{2}\\partial_{j}q_{ij } ] \\nonumber \\\\[5pt ] [ \\partial_{t}+v_i \\partial_i]q_{ij } = \\lambda s u_{ij}+q_{ik}\\omega_{kj}-\\omega_{ik}q_{kj}+\\gamma^{-1}h_{ij } \\nonumber\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we defined @xmath86 . here",
    "we have neglected the inertial convective term in the velocity equation because we are interested in fluids of cytoskeletal filaments and motor proteins for which the typical reynolds number is small . however , since both the nematic order and the concentration of particles can be advected by the flow , the associated terms in the equations for @xmath13 and @xmath4 can not be neglected .",
    "the dynamics of such an active nematic suspension is governed by the interplay between the active forcing , whose rate @xmath87 is proportional to the activity parameters @xmath40 and @xmath88 , and the relaxation of the passive structures , the solvent and the nematic phase , in which energy is dissipated or stored .",
    "the response of the passive structures , as described here , occurs at three different time scales : the relaxational time scale of the nematic degrees of freedom @xmath89 , the diffusive time scale @xmath90 , and the dissipation time scale of the solvent @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the system size . while the presence of three dimensionless parameters makes for a very rich phenomenology , for simplicity we choose parameter values in this work so that the three passive time scales are of the same magnitude @xmath93 .",
    "when @xmath94 , the active forcing is irrelevant and the system behaves like a traditional passive suspension . on the other hand , when @xmath95 , the passive structures can balance the active forcing leading to a stationary regime in which active stresses are accommodated via both elastic distortion and flow .",
    "finally , when @xmath96 the passive structures respond too slowly to compensate active forces , leading to a dynamical and possibly chaotic interplay between activity , nematic order and flow . in the rest of the paper , we quantify these different regimes .    for further manipulations it is convenient to make the system dimensionless by scaling all lengths using the rod length @xmath3 , scaling time with the relaxation time of the director field @xmath97 , and scaling stresses by the elastic stress @xmath98 .",
    "the simplest geometry in which to analyze the hydrodynamic equations given in the previous section is a two - dimensional channel of infinite length and finite width .",
    "this geometry has been studied in detail for active nematic and polar suspensions under the assumption of constant magnitude of the nematic order parameter @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature of active nematic fluids in a channel is the `` spontaneous flow transition '' : when the activity parameter @xmath88 is increased past a threshold , the system goes from a stationary state in which the director field is parallel to the walls of the channel to a state of non - uniform orientation and flow .",
    "here we show that lifting the assumption of constant nematic order parameter leads to a second transition to oscillatory flow not considered previously in theories of active nematics .",
    "we consider a channel of infinite length along the @xmath99 direction of a cartesian frame and finite width @xmath92 along @xmath100 .",
    "the channel is bounded by no - slip surfaces at @xmath101 and @xmath102 . assuming translational invariance in the @xmath99 direction , the flow field is completely defined by the velocity field @xmath103 since the incompressibility condition implies that @xmath104 thus , @xmath105 since the fluid is confined .",
    "the strain rate tensor has only one non - zero component @xmath106 .",
    "calling @xmath107 the angle between the director field @xmath0 and the @xmath99 axis , the nematic tensor can be expressed in the simple form : @xmath108 under these conditions the hydrodynamic equations ( [ eq : fullequations ] ) simplify to : @xmath109 \\partial_{t}c   = \\partial_{y}\\left[\\left(d_{0}-\\tfrac{1}{2}d_{1}s^{2}\\cos 2\\theta\\right)\\partial_{y}c-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\alpha_{1}c^{2}\\partial_{y}(s\\cos 2\\theta)\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\[5pt ] \\partial_{t}s = \\partial_{y}^{2}s - s[a(c)+\\tfrac{1}{2}c(c)s^{2}-\\lambda u \\sin 2\\theta+4(\\partial_{y}\\theta)^{2 } ] \\nonumber \\\\[5pt ] \\partial_{t}\\theta = \\partial_{y}^{2}\\theta+2s^{-1}\\partial_{y}s\\,\\partial_{y}\\theta-\\tfrac{1}{2 } u ( 1-\\lambda\\cos 2\\theta ) \\label{eq : slab - geometry}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that the inertia of the active particles is negligible and the dependence of the coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 on the concentration @xmath13 is as explained previously ( the procedure for decoupling the angle @xmath107 and the order parameter @xmath9 is given in appendix [ sec : appendix1 ] ) .",
