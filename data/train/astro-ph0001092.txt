    "every classical nova outburst should result in the ejection of @xmath15 to @xmath16 of material at velocities of the order of hundreds to thousands of kilometres per second ( bode & evans 1989 ) .",
    "study of these expanding shells of nova ejecta has importance for a range of astrophysical areas including the physics of thermonuclear reactions , mixing mechanisms , nebular shaping , radiation - driven winds , clumping mechanisms , astrophysical chemistry and the formation of dust .",
    "novae provide a real - time laboratory in which these processes can be investigated .",
    "the work presented in this series of papers builds on our ground - based imaging survey of the ejecta of old novae using 4-m class telescopes ( slavin , obrien & dunlop 1995 , gill & obrien 1998 ) in two ways .",
    "firstly we present high - resolution imaging obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "this is then complemented by kinematical information obtained from spatially - resolved spectroscopy using the william herschel and anglo - australian telescopes ( wht & aat respectively ) .",
    "this first paper presents the hst images and medium - resolution long - slit wht spectra of the shells of fh ser and v533 her in the region of h@xmath0 .",
    "we also present non - detections in the hst imaging of bt mon , dk lac and v476 cyg . ",
    "[ obs ] describes the observations and  [ res ] presents the results .",
    "the data are interpreted and discussed in  [ int ] .",
    "the corresponding observations of hr del , rr pic , t aur , v1500 cyg and v842 cen will be presented in papers to follow .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations of the novae were made during 1997/98  see table 1 . in each case",
    "the nova was positioned on the planetary camera chip of wfpc2 .",
    "the pixel scale is 46  mas with a complex point spread function distributing 60% of the flux from a point source over the 3@xmath173 pixel region centred on the source .",
    "the standard pipeline data processing was used ( leitherer 1995 ) and the images combined eliminating cosmic rays and bad pixels using standard tasks in stsdas / iraf .",
    "narrow band photometry was performed using the prescription described by dudziak and walsh ( 1997 ) . for the images where there was no immediately obvious detection of an ejected shell we applied a 7@xmath177 sliding - box median - filter to the images to reduce the effects of noise and contamination from low level cosmic rays .",
    "this process enhanced the slower varying underlying background which is more consistent with an extended nova shell and thus allowed visual detection of shells to be investigated .",
    "long - slit spectra of the shells of fh ser and v533 her were taken on the 4.2 m wht in la palma , canary islands using the isis spectrometer on 1996 aug 3  see table 1 .",
    "this instrument has the advantage of having both a blue and red arm which allows simultaneous observations of two wavelength ranges with a suitable dichroic . using the tek-1 and tek-2 chips with the r1200b and r1200r gratings this instrument has a spectral range of 420   and a dispersion of 0.41 / pixel in both arms .",
    "observations were taken with central wavelengths of @xmath18 4950 and 6600   for the blue and red arms respectively to allow primarily the lines of h@xmath0 and h@xmath19 ( @xmath18 6562.8 and 4861.3  respectively ) to be examined as well as [ o  iii ] ( @xmath18 4959 and 5007 ) , [ n  ii ] ( @xmath18 6549 and 6583 ) and he i ( @xmath20 4921 , 5015 and 6677 ) .",
    "the dispersion along the slit was 0.36 arcsec per pixel .",

    "the spectra were reduced using standard techniques .",
    "fh ser ( nova ser 1970 ) erupted in 1970 and was discovered by honda ( 1970 ) .",
    "it reached a peak visual magnitude of 4.4 on feb 18 ( burkhead et al .",

    "the lightcurve shows a significant dq - her - type dip ( e.g. fig . 2 of rosino et al .",

    "recently it has been classifed as a ` slow ' nova belonging to the _ fe ii _ spectroscopic class ( della valle & livio 1998 , williams 1992 ) .",
    "duerbeck ( 1992 ) produced the first image of the shell from which he measured a radius of 2.7 arcsec and described an equatorial band of enhanced emission .",
    "he derived an orbital inclination of 58@xmath2 and a distance of 850 pc .",
    "later images were taken by slavin at al.(1995 ) in 1993 september .",
    "their images were deeper and in several narrow wavebands covering approximately @xmath18 6530 to 6608 .",
    "they also resolved the equatorial enhancement and derived an inclination angle of @xmath22 .",
    "they suggested that the equatorial band is due to h@xmath0 emission from a density enhancement .",
    "della valle et al . ( 1997 ) imaged this nova shell in 1996 march with a h@xmath0+[n  ii ] filter .",
    "they showed the shell to be elliptical with outer diameters of 7.6 and 9 arcsec with a peak - to - peak minor axis of 5.4 arcsec .",
    "no peak - to - peak major axis was given .",
    "they also showed that the shell had an equatorial ring .",
    "they derived an inclination angle of 60@xmath2 and a distance of 870@xmath190 pc .",

    "the shell takes the form of a very clumpy limb - brightened prolate ellipsoid .",
    "there is a clear equatorial ring which is brighter in the western half compared to the eastern .",
    "if we assume this equatorial enhancement is an inclined circular ring then the derived inclination angle is 62@xmath11@xmath2 .",

    "when this ellipsoid is de - projected the true axial ratio of the shell is found to be 1.26@xmath10.08 .",
    "the long - slit spectra for both slit positions for the region of 65206610   are shown in fig .",
    "[ fh_spec ] .",
    "both slits show velocity ellipses of the shell in the lines of h@xmath0 ( @xmath24 6562.8 ) and [ n  ii ] ( @xmath24 6549  and @xmath24 6583 ) .",
    "the only other detection of emission was from h@xmath19 which has the same appearance as that of the h@xmath0 ring .",
    "the two slit positions have been displayed using the same high and low levels to allow relative comparison of fluxes ( it should be noted that the run was not photometric but a first order comparison is possible ) .    in slit position 1 the velocity ellipse in h@xmath0 of the shell",
    "can clearly be seen between the two fainter [ n  ii ] ellipses . the h@xmath0 ellipse shows clumpiness on small scales super - imposed on a well defined velocity ellipse .",
    "the [ n  ii ] ellipses are both barely detected apart from a feature above ( blue - shifted ) and below ( red - shifted ) the central continuum source corresponding to the equatorial ring seen in the hst image . for the @xmath24 6549   line these features appear at @xmath24@xmath256538   and 6555  ( within the h@xmath0 ellipse ) , and for the @xmath24 6583  line they appear at @xmath24@xmath256573  ( co - incident with the red - shifted h@xmath0 ellipse ) and 6591 . the fact that the equatorial ring feature above the stellar continuum ( the west ) is blue - shifted and the feature below is red - shifted indicates that the shell is inclined so that the western part of the shell is tilted away from the observer .    in slit position 2",
    "the velocity ellipses are quite different to those in slit 1 .",
    "the northern and southern halves look the same and the brightness of the [ n  ii ] @xmath24 6583  ellipse is comparable to that from the h@xmath0 ellipse .",
    "the h@xmath0 ellipse seems to be of fairly uniform intensity whereas the [ n  ii ] ellipse is brighter near the extremities of the shell ( top and bottom of the slit ) . by inspection of the image in fig.[fh_image ] it can be seen that the edges of the shell correspond with the region where the equatorial ring is fully within the slit .",
    "the brightest region in the [ n  ii ] @xmath24 6583  ellipse is brighter than any region in the h@xmath0 ellipse .",
    "v533 her ( nova herculis 1963 ) was discovered by dahlgren ( 1963 ) and extensively studied by chincarini & rosino ( 1964 ) .",
    "it declined with a @xmath21 time of 44d ( see duerbeck 1981 using aavso light curves ) . however combining the v light curve presented by chincarini ( 1964 ) which shows that it declined to 6th magnitude sometime between march 4 and 8 with the post - discovery results ( see haddock et al .",
    "1963 ) that it actually reached magnitude 3 on jan 30 shows it may be more accurate to quote a @xmath21 time of around 35d .",
    "it has been classified as a ` slow ' nova belonging to the _ fe ii _ spectroscopic class ( della valle & livio 1997 ) .",
    "the nebulosity around v533 her was first detected by cohen & rosenthal ( 1983 ) by comparison with a point spread function .",

    "the signal to noise in the hst image is however not sufficient to provide any more information than was already apparent from the earlier ground - based image .",
    "wht isis spectra were obtained on 1996 aug 3 .",
    "two slit positions were used ; slit 1 at pa 160@xmath2 along the equatorial ring and slit 2 at pa 70@xmath2 orthogonal to the equatorial ring .",
    "both used a slit of width 1  arcsec .",
    "the two positions are indicated on the wht image in figure[v533_image ] reproduced from slavin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) but rotated to correspond to the orientation of the hst image shown alongside .",
    "the spectra in the region of h@xmath0 are shown in figure  [ v533_spec ] ( the h@xmath19 range is not reproduced here as , although the shell is just visible , the signal to noise is very poor ) . from these spectra",
    "we see that the radius of the shell at the first slit position is @xmath26  arcsec whilst at the second slit position this increases to @xmath27  arcsec .",
    "hence there is some evidence that the shell is elliptical with an apparent axial ratio of @xmath9 .",
    "the major axis is orthogonal to the equatorial band which is consistent with a prolate ellipsoidal shell as observed in other novae e.g.  fh ser .",
    "we are unable to estimate an inclination and hence a true axial ratio as the equatorial band is not clearly detected in the hst image .",
    "the maximum line of sight velocity ( obtained from the points where the slits cross at the centre of the nebula ) is estimated to be @xmath11  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "expansion parallax , taking into account the estimated errors in the shell diameter and expansion velocity , leads to a distance estimate of @xmath12  pc .",
    "bt mon reached maximum in 1939 september .",
    "the @xmath21 time is disputed in the literature due to the exact date of maximum light being missed .",
    "payne - gaposchkin ( 1964 ) quotes a @xmath21 of 36 days calculated from spectral data whereas schaefer & patterson ( 1983 ) quote a @xmath21 of 190 days from the light curve after maximum .",
    "the shell has been detected around this nova in spectroscopic observations by marsh et al .",
    "the only image of the shell is that by gill & obrien ( 1998 ) .",
    "they claimed detection of a ring of emission of diameter @xmath257 arcsec after deconvolution of the image with various techniques .",
    "bt mon was imaged with hst in two observations for a total of 2500s .",
    "the median - smoothed image of bt mon is shown in fig.[nondetect ] .",
    "no shell is detected putting a 3@xmath13 upper limit on the surface brightness of the shell at 6@xmath28erg@xmath6s@xmath3arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "v476 cyg ( nova cygni 1920 ) reached maximum on 1920 august 24 .",
    "the measured @xmath21 time for its decline was 16.5d ( duerbeck 1987 ) classifying it as a very fast nova .",
    "a diffuse shell of radius @xmath29  arcsec was detected by slavin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . with their integration time of 900s it was barely detected above the 3 sigma level .",
    "v476 cyg was imaged with the hst for a total of 2600s ( cosmic ray split by a factor 2 ) .",
    "the median - smoothed image of v476 cyg is shown at the top left of fig.[nondetect ] where no nova shell is detected .",
    "this provides a 3@xmath13 upper limit to the shell surface brightness of 5@xmath1710@xmath30erg@xmath6s@xmath3arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "dk lac ( nova lacertae 1950 ) was discovered during its rise in 1950 january .",
    "the nova declined at a moderately fast rate with a @xmath21 of 32d , accompanied by large variations of brightness .",
    "slavin et al .  ( 1995 ) detected the shell around dk lac , measuring is radius as 2.0 to 2.5 arcsec , although the shell is poorly distinguished from the central source .    the median - smoothed hst image of dk lac ( total integration time 2500s )",
    "is shown at the bottom left of fig.[nondetect ] .",
    "no shell is detected providing a 3@xmath13 upper limit on the shell surface brightness of 6@xmath28erg@xmath6s@xmath3arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "the [ n  ii ] features seen in the spectrum from the first slit position ( s1 ) directly above and below the central source and the [ n  ii ] features at the extremities of the shell in the spectrum from the second slit position ( s2 ) are associated with the equatorial ring clearly seen in the image .",
    "we would expect h@xmath0 to mirror this behaviour if the ring results from an enhancement in density .",
    "however it can clearly be seen in s2 that h@xmath0 is not greatly enhanced in the ring at all .",
    "the [ n  ii ] ring features in s1 are approximately 40 times greater than the typical [ n  ii ] flux in the rest of the shell ; although the h@xmath0 ellipse is rather clumpy in s1 , there is no obvious comparative increase in brightness in the corresponding regions for the ring .",
    "therefore the equatorial ring is dominated by enhanced emission in [ n  ii ] .    this picture is supported by the images in slavin et al .  ( 1995 ) . in their figure 3c they show an image of the fh ser remnant taken with a filter central wavelength @xmath24 6560 , fwhm 17 . from examining the long slit spectra shown in this paper",
    "we can see that this will include almost all light in h@xmath0 apart from the parts of the shell moving directly towards or away from us .",
    "there should be no [",
    "n  ii ] contamination .",
    "this image shows only a smooth ring of emission resembling a simple limb - brightened shell .",
    "there is no evidence in this image for an equatorial enhancement .",
    "slavin et al .  also show an image with filter central wavelength @xmath24 6537 , fwhm @xmath31 17  ( their figure 3a ) .",
    "from our spectra we can see that this corresponds primarily to blue - shifted [ n  ii ] @xmath24 6549 .",
    "this image shows a half - crescent of emission with very little emission in the rest of the shell which again implies the equatorial enhancement is an [ n  ii ] feature .",
    "this crescent of emission is to the west of the central source which agrees with our suggestion that the eastern pole is tilted towards us .      using the code described in gill & obrien ( 1999 ) it is possible to produce synthetic images and spectra for simple models of the fh ser nova shell .",
    "the code calculates emission as a function of density and therefore separate models needed to be produced for the h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] emission lines .",
    "the lines can be scaled relative to one another by arbitrary factors and then combined , taking into account the rest wavelengths of the lines and the doppler shifting of each element , to produce a spectral cube for a given wavelength range .    to generate the synthetic spectra the spectral cube",
    "was then smoothed in the spatial directions with the equivalent of a 0.5 arcsec fwhm gaussian to simulate the seeing of the ground - based observations .",
    "a ` slit ' was then positioned on the cube at positions and widths to correspond with the observations .",
    "smoothing must be performed before the slit is positioned onto the cube to allow light to be scattered into and out of the slit .",
    "the possibility of correction for a systemic velocity for any model was incorporated to allow a best fit to the data .",
    "synthetic images were generated by convolving the unsmoothed spectral cubes with the system throughput of the hst with the f656n filter ( leitherer 1995 ) .",
    "this was approximated by a profile starting with zero throughput at @xmath24 6545 , rising linearly to peak at @xmath24 6554 , remaining constant to @xmath24 6576 , then falling linearly back to zero at @xmath24 6582 .",
    "the images were then generated by collapsing the filtered spectral cube in the spectral direction .",
    "we have generated models corresponding to a thin prolate ellipsoidal shell with ellipticity 1.3 and inclination 62@xmath2 .",
    "for the [ n  ii ] components an equatorial enhancement by a factor of 40 in intensity was also added in a thin ring .",
    "the light from h@xmath0 was increased by a factor of 8.6 relative to the typical ( i.e.  not the enhanced value appropriate to the ring ) [ n  ii ] @xmath24 6583   line ( to best fit the observations ) , and the [ n  ii ] @xmath24 6549   scaled by a factor 0.34 relative to the [ n  ii ] @xmath24 6583   line .",
    "velocities were set proportional to the distance from the centre of the ellipsoid and the maximum line of sight velocity was set to be 530 km / s . for the model spectra to best fit the observations it was found that a systemic velocity of @xmath445 km / s was required .",
    "the resulting synthetic spectra for positions s1 and s2 can be seen in fig .  [ fh_spec_syn ] and the synthetic image in fig .  [ fh_im_syn ] .",
    "the model agrees closely with the observations shown in fig.[fh_spec ] .",
    "this also allows us to derive a distance to fh ser of 950@xmath150 pc which takes full account of the asphericity of the shell .",
    "if we examine the observed image in fig.[fh_image ] we see that the equatorial ring is brighter in one half than the other , behaviour replicated in our synthetic image in fig.[fh_im_syn ] .",
    "our model shows that this is because the system throughput of the hst with the f656n filter lets through the red - shifted @xmath24 6549  light and the blue - shifted @xmath24 6583  light .",
    "therefore the ring seen in the image is nt actually a whole ring from one line but two halves of the ring each from a different line .",
    "the ratio of the lines in this doublet is always @xmath32/[6583]=0.34 $ ] , so the half of the ring visible in the image which is produced by the @xmath24 6583  line is 3 times brighter than the @xmath24 6549  half .      for the equatorial ring to be enhanced in [ n  ii ] relative to the rest of the shell requires either a density , ionization or metallicity effect .",
    "a simple density increase would produce more [ n  ii ] ( providing that the level did not start to become collisionally de - excited ) but also more h@xmath0 and is therefore presumably not the solution .",
    "an increase in the amount of nitrogen in the equatorial plane of the fh ser shell could explain the [ n  ii ] enhancement .",
    "there is the possibility of a metallicity variation across the surface of the white dwarf before eruption due to rotation of the white dwarf although it is difficult to see how a thin enhancement of nitrogen could be produced rather than a more wide - spread variation around the shell .",
    "the final possibility is an ionization effect which would require either an increase or decrease in ionization in the equatorial region .",
    "a good candidate for providing such an effect is the accretion disc around the central source .",
    "an explanation could be that the main shell is very highly ionized , doubly ionized or above , by the central parts of the accretion disk .",
    "the equatorial region is then shadowed from this hot central uv source , causing the relative abundance of nitrogen in the singly ionized state to be increased .",
    "this would then produce an increase in [ n  ii ] emission in a thin equatorial region with no increase in h@xmath0 .",
    "this proposal needs testing by further observation and modelling .",
    "a similar suggestion was made by petitjean et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for the shell of dq her .",
    "hst wfpc2 images and wht spectroscopy of fh ser have allowed us to derive a consistent model for its shell as an ellipsoid with ellipticity 1.3@xmath10.1 , and inclination 62@xmath14@xmath2 .",
    "the equatorial expansion rate is found to be 490@xmath120  km  s@xmath3 and the systemic velocity @xmath33  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this gives a distance to fh ser of 950@xmath150  pc .",
    "these values agree within the errors with the results presented in previous papers ( della valle et al .",
    "1997 , slavin et al .",
    "1995 , duerbeck 1992 ) .",
    "the equatorial ring seen in the hst images and previous ground - based images is found to be due to a 40@xmath17 increase in emission from [ n  ii ] rather than h@xmath0+[n  ii ] .",
    "it is suggested that the origin of this ring lies either in abundance gradients in the shell or in aspherical illumination of the shell by the central photoionizing source .",
    "this latter suggestion will be developed in a paper to follow .",
    "similar imaging and spectroscopy of the nova v533 her reveal a shell of radius @xmath255  arcsec with an axial ratio of @xmath9 .",
    "the expansion velocity of this shell is @xmath11  km  s@xmath3 and the distance is estimated to be @xmath12  pc .",
    "the quality of the data is however not sufficient for us to examine the structure of the shell in as much detail as was possible for the shell of fh ser .",
    "our hst images of bt mon , v476 cyg and dk lac provided only upper limits on the surface brightness of their shells .",
    "this may seem surprising given that these shells had been previously detected from the ground ( gill & obrien 1998 , slavin et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however it should be noted that the ground - based images were taken using the large aperture 4.2 m wht and 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope .",
    "although the improved spatial resolution of hst helps overcome its reduced collecting area when the nebula is clumpy and these clumps are unresolved from the ground this does not apply when the emission is more smoothly distributed .",
    "these nova shells were not particularly well - detected in the ground - based survey ( bt mon requiring image deconvolution ) so it is perhaps not too surprising that we did not detect them here .",
    "other novae to be investigated in the following papers of this series include hr  del , rr  pic , t  aur , v842  cen and v1500  cyg .",
