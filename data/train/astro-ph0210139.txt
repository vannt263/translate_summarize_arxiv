    "for almost four decades , since the discovery of quasars , mounting observational evidence has accumulated that black holes indeed exist in nature .",
    "recent observations ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) of the steep emissivity of seyfert 1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 , indicating strong photon emission at radii near the event horizon ; and observations of the lack of evidence of the expected ion `` dusty '' torus of m87 ( perlman et al .",
    "2001 ) , have prompted astrophysicists to suggest a new energy source .",
    "however , it is hardly a new energy source to relativists , i.e. , those who study einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "they knew for sometime , at least theoretically , what black holes were capable of doing ( williams 1991 , 1995 ) . williams ( 1995 , 2003 , 2002 ) shows , through theoretical and numerical ( monte carlo ) _ n - particle _ calculations of penrose ( 1969 ) processes , occurring at radii inside the ergosphere of a rotating black hole near the event horizon : including the `` plunging '' regimes ( bardeen , press , & teukolsky 1972 ; williams 1995 ; krolik 1999 ) , that the black hole can yield escaping particles with energies up to @xmath3  gev .",
    "these particles escape in the form of collimated , symmetrical and asymmetrical jets about the polar axis , confirming the existence of intrinsically collimated vortical jets , found theoretical by de felice & calvani ( 1972 ) ; de felice & curir ( 1992 ) ; de felice & carlotto ( 1997 ) ; de felice & zanotti ( 2000 ) : from geometrical studies of particle trajectories in a kerr ( 1963 ) metric .",
    "the kerr metric in general describes the spacetime separation of events in the gravitational field of a rotating compact massive object .    in light of the above observational surprises , particularly the steep emissivity of x - rays producing the broad fe k@xmath4 emission line at @xmath5  kev in mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) and similar agns , it appears that gravity has triumphed over proposed forms of electromagnetic energy extraction from a black hole , as will be described in this paper .",
    "this should be of no surprise near the event horizon , where the gravitational forces are so strong that electromagnetic radiation itself becomes trapped .",
    "overall , energy extraction from black holes and the production of their associated jets have been the most poorly understood phenomena of today .",
    "it is clear that gravitational accretion and magnetic fields play a role , but how ?",
    "has been the mystery .",
    "we observe these jets in quasars and microquasars due to supermassive and stellar size black holes , respectively .",
    "therefore , we know that any effective model must have the commonality to explain jets in both systems . at present there are two popular trains of thought associated with energy extraction and the production of jets in black holes : one is that the jets are inherent properties of geodesic trajectories in the kerr metric of a rotating black hole , and thus , can be described by einstein s general theory of relativity ; and the other is that the accretion disk and its magnetic field through magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) are producing the jets .",
    "perhaps it could be a combination of the two , with gravity controlling the flow near the event horizon ( williams 2004 ) , and mhd controlling the flow at distances farther away .",
    "the observations of the jet of m87 suggest this may be the case ( junor , biretta , & livio 1999 ; perlman et al .",
    "2001 ) .    there are some proposed mhd model calculations using a general relativistic accretion disk that involve having the magnetic field lines of the disk `` anchor '' to conductive ionized particles of the disk , inside the ergospheric region , extracting rotational energy from a kerr black hole , by way of a poynting flux of electromagnetic energy , out to infinity .",
    "such models have been proposed to explain recent observations of possible direct evidence for the extraction of energy from a rotating black hole ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this paper , however , i point out problems with such models that make these models highly improbable to be at work , i.e. , extracting the energy needed to be consistent with general observations of sources powered by black holes .",
    "it is agreed by the author that some form of the penrose mechanism is employed , but it is argued below that electromagnetic energy extraction is not an effective way to use this mechanism .",
    "associated problems with such models are described in detail in the appendix .    in a classical paper by bardeen et al .",
    "( 1972 ) , astrophysical implausible penrose processes are discussed concerning the breakup of subrelativistic objects in the ergosphere",
    ". however , i point out that the `` penrose - williams '' mechanism , described by williams ( 1995 ) , involves relativistic scattering processes : such processes can be very efficient ( piran , shaham , & katz 1975 ; williams 1995 ) , and do not fall under the category of being implausible due to hydrodynamical constraints ( bardeen et al .",
    "1972 ) , since the incident and target particles in the collisions are already relativistic , having speeds @xmath6 .",
    "the penrose mechanism as described here ( williams 1995 ) has a `` one - on - one '' consistent relationship with accretion disk particles .",
    "for example , particles from the accretion disk can populate the high energy gravitationally blueshifted trapped orbits ( or so - called plunging orbits ) at @xmath7 , the marginal stable orbit ( bardeen et al .",
    "particles in these now populated orbits can undergo penrose processes with lower soft x - ray energy infalling accretion disk photons : penrose compton scattering ( pcs ) produces copious distributions of high energy x - rays and soft @xmath8-rays , and penrose pair production ( ppp ) ( @xmath0 ) produces copious distributions of relativistic electron - positron ( @xmath9 ) pairs , with up to @xmath10% of the particles escaping along vortical orbits (   [ sec : collimation ] ) that circle the polar axis of the kbh many times , as spacetime itself is dragged around because of gravity ( williams 2004 ) .",
    "the particles escape to infinity along well defined four - momentum trajectories , with some intersecting the disk ( i.e. , returning to be reprocessed and/or escaping to infinity ) .",
    "this scenario is particularly consistent with recent observations of mcg6 - 30 - 15 (   [ sec : mcg ] ) , and other black hole sources (   [ sec : observation ] ) .    importantly ,",
    "in these penrose processes we do not need the magnetic field of the accretion disk to `` communicate '' between the accretion disk and the black hole .",
    "therefore , there is no need for the blandford and znajek ( bz ) ( 1977 ) proposed type models ( and their many associated problems ) in the direct role of energy extraction from a spinning black hole .",
    "however , their presence appears to be need once particles are on escaping orbits , serving the same effects they do in the jets of protostars , i.e. , appearing to have a dominant role on a large scale , within the weak field limit , at distances outside the strong effects of general relativity .    as for producing the observed synchrotron radiation , indicating the present of a magnetic field near the core region , this radiation",
    "could very well be produced by the intrinsically self - induced magnetic field due to the dynamo - like action of the escaping penrose produced @xmath9 pairs , escaping on vortical , coil - like trajectories concentric the polar axis , in the form of a swirling `` current '' plasma .",
    "this , therefore , adds more to the unimportance of the accretion disk magnetic field near the event horizon",
    ".    moreover , although suggested to be evidence of rotational magnetic energy extraction from the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( wilms et al . 2001 ) , it appears , as we shall see in this paper , that it is gravitational energy momentum being extracted , in the form of a relativistic particle flux via penrose processes , as described by williams ( 1995 ) , and _ not _ the poynting flux of electromagnetic energy suggested : produced by magnetic field lines torquing the black hole or plunging accretion disk material , as described by the bz - type models . in the penrose - williams mechanism ,",
    "the steep emissivity profile [ @xmath11 of x - ray photons observed ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) , requiring a x - ray source that is both powerful and very centrally concentrated ( which can not be explained by standard accretion disk models ) , is consistent with energy being extracted by penrose compton scattering processes , occurring at radii between the marginally bound and marginally stable orbits , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ( williams 1995 ) .",
    "this black hole source mcg6 - 30 - 15 will be discussed further in   [",
    "sec : mcg ] .",
    "nevertheless , once these penrose processes have occurred and particles are on escaping trajectories , they can then interact , say with the expected large scale structure disk magnetic field , at some effective radius @xmath14 where this field becomes important in jet collimation , probably similar to a relative radius existing for the collimated bi - polar jets of protostars , which , as mentioned above , appear to be undergoing some type of bz effect  the direct effect is still somewhat unclear .",
    "it appears that the magnetic field of the accretion disk serves to aid in collimating into jets gravitational binding energy release due to gravitational accretion , in both protostars and agns ( or microquasars ) ; however , in the latter it appears that the jets are superimposed with collimated particles from penrose processes .",
    "so , overall , in this paper , an analysis of the penrose mechanism is presented to describe gravitational - particle interactions close to the event horizon at radii @xmath15 and down to the _ photon orbit _ , @xmath16 , for a canonical kbh with @xmath17 ( thorne 1974 ) , where @xmath18 is the angular momentum per unit mass parameter .",
    "in this fully general relativistic description , polar jets of relativistic particles of photons and @xmath9 pairs are produced and collimated by gravity alone , without the necessity of the external magnetic field of the accretion disk .",
    "this theoretical and numerical model of penrose processes can apply to any size black hole , and suggests a complete theory for the extraction of energy momentum from a rotating black hole . in   [ sec : model ] a summary of the general formalism of the model is presented . in   [ sec : results ] , results of theoretical and numerical calculated luminosities and energies are presented , along with discussion of the escaping particles space momentum trajectories : featuring asymmetrical polar distributions and vortical orbits . also in   [ sec : results ] , agreement with observations of specific sources are presented . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] a summary and conclusions are presented .",
    "the primary model ( williams 1995 ) consists of a supermassive @xmath19 rotating kerr black hole plus particles from an assumed relativistic bistable thin disk / ion corona [ or torus , i.e. , advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ] , two - temperature [ separate temperatures for protons ( @xmath20  k ) and electrons ( @xmath21  k ) ] accretion ( williams 2003 ; novikov & thorne 1973 ; eardley & lightman 1975 ; eilek 1980 ; eilek & kafatos 1983 ) . the bistable accretion disk can exist either in the thin disk phase and/or the ion corona ( adaf ) phase , or oscillate between the two ( see williams 2003 and references therein ) in various degrees  which could be responsible for the observed variability . the penrose effect as employed here can operated in either phase .",
    "the penrose mechanism is used to extract rotational energy momentum by scattering processes inside the ergosphere ( @xmath22 , in the equatorial plane for @xmath17 ) .",
    "see williams ( 1995 ) for a detailed description of the model .",
    "the `` quasi - penrose '' ( williams 1991 , 1995 ) processes investigated are ( a ) penrose compton scattering ( pcs ) of equatorial low energy radially infalling photons by equatorially confined ( @xmath23 ) and nonequatorially confined ( @xmath24 ) orbiting target electrons , at radii between the marginally bound ( @xmath25 ) and marginally stable ( @xmath26 ) orbits , where @xmath27 is the so - called carter constant ( carter 1968 ) , referred to as the @xmath28 value ( williams 1995 ) ; ( b ) ppp ( @xmath29 ) at @xmath12 ; and ( c ) ppp ( @xmath0 ) by equatorial low energy radially infalling photons and high energy gravitationally blueshifted ( by factor @xmath30 ) nonequatorially confined @xmath8-rays at the photon orbit ( @xmath16 ) , where @xmath31 is the `` blueshift '' factor given by the @xmath32 component of the kerr metric ( see williams 1995 ) .",
    "although in the scattering plane the incident angle of the infalling photon relative to the target particle is expected in general to be at least between @xmath33 ( due to the bending of light and/or inertial frame dragging ) , maximum energy is extracted in the process when the incident angle is @xmath34 , as it is for radially infalling photons ( @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the azimuthal coordinate angular momentum ) .",
    "note , the target particles are initially in bound ( marginally stable or unstable ) trapped orbits , trapped in the sense of possibly having no other way of escaping save these penrose processes ( bardeen et al .",
    "1972 ; williams 1995 ) .",
    "note also that , as the nonequatorially confined target particle , whose orbital trajectory is derived by williams ( 1991 , 1995 ; see also williams 2002 ) , passes through the equatorial plane , in its bound circular orbit at constant radius , the @xmath28 value , a constant of motion as measured by an observer at infinity ( carter 1968 ; williams 1995 ) , equals @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the polar coordinate momentum of the particle .",
    "setting @xmath39 , in the carter constant expression for the orbital @xmath28 value , gives the maximum and minimum latitudinal angles of the trajectories about the equatorial plane for wilkins ( 1972 ) `` spherical - like '' nonequatorially confined orbits ( see williams 2003 ) .",
    "these unstable , bound or marginally bound orbits ( equatorial , nonequatorial ) of the target particles are assumed to be populated by accretion disk instability processes and prior penrose processes .",
    "such particles must satisfy conditions to have a turning point at the scattering radius ( note , a bound stable orbit is considered to have a `` perpetual '' turning point ) .",
    "these conditions depend on the orbital conserved parameters of the particle : @xmath40 , the energy , and @xmath36 , or @xmath28 . in williams ( 1995 , 2002 )",
    "such conditions are discussed in detail ; see also the possible scenario discussion in   [ sec : asymmetry ] of this present manuscript .",
    "in addition , the `` instability phase , '' during which the target particle orbits are presumed to be populated , could very well be related to the timescale of the prominent observed variabilities of the source .",
    "radial infalling equatorially confined incident photons are assumed , not only for maximum energy extraction but for the simplicity of their geodesics as well , since it appears that an infalling equatorially confined photon will not acquire gravitationally blueshifted orbital energy momentum as measured by an observer at infinity , only frame dragging blueshifted energy ( eq .",
    "[ 2.8@xmath41 of williams 1995 ) .",
    "this is because the @xmath28 value of such photons is zero ( see eq .  [ 2.27 ] of williams 1995 ) .",
    "the incoming photons , however , need not be confined to the equatorial plane . in these calculations if equatorially confined infalling photons were not desired , @xmath42 of the initial photon would not be set equal zero .",
    "that is , the model calculation is set up such that one can change the initial energy - momentum four vector components ( or four - momenta ) of the incident and target particles to accommodate any 3-space dimensional geometrical disk configuration .",
    "moreover , in an adaf ( including the ion corona ) , during the infall of particles , through the ergosphere , some of the particles are expected to become trapped in nonequatorial `` spherical - like orbits '' ( wilkins 1972 ) : such orbits would past through the equatorial plane : here is where the scattering takes place in these calculations .",
    "note , the target photons at the photon orbit can only exist in nonequatorially confined orbits ( williams 1995 ) ; this is also pointed out by bardeen ( 1973 ) .",
    "monte carlo _",
    "n - particle _ computer simulations of up to @xmath43 scattering events of infalling accretion disk photons ( normalized to a power - law distribution ) are executed for each computed penrose produced luminosity spectrum ( williams 2003 ) .",
    "energy and momentum ( i.e. , four - momentum ) spectra of escaping particles ( @xmath8-rays , @xmath9 pairs ) , as measured by an observer at infinity , are obtained per each 2000 scattering events per monochromatic infalling photon distribution .",
    "the following constituents are used ( williams 1995 ) : ( 1 ) general relativity is used [ the kerr metric spacetime geometry yields equatorially and nonequatorially confined spherical - like ( wilkins 1972 ) particle orbits and escape conditions , conserved energy and angular momentum parameters , and transformations from the boyer - lindquist coordinate frame ( blf ) to the local nonrotating frame ( lnrf ) ] .",
    "note , blf is the observer at infinity ( boyer & lindquist 1967 ) ; lnrf is the local minkowski ( flat ) spacetime . ( 2",
    ") special relativity is used [ in the lnrf , physical processes ( i.e. , the scatterings ) are done ; lorentz transformations between inertial frames are performed ; and lorentz invariant laws are applied ] .",
    "( 3 ) cross sections are used [ application of the monte carlo method to the cross sections , in the electron rest frame for pcs , in the proton rest frame for ppp(@xmath29 ) , and in the center of momentum frame for ppp(@xmath0 ) , give the distributions of scattering angles and final energies ] .",
    "in general , energies attained using the proposed accretion disk model are the following ( williams 1995 ) :    i. _ pcs_.for the input photon energy range @xmath44  kev to 0.15  mev , the corresponding output energy range is @xmath45 3  kev to 7  mev . the input photon range covers the range of photons in a thin disk ( @xmath46  kev ) , thin disk / ion corona ( @xmath46  kev , @xmath47  kev ) , and adaf ( @xmath47  kev ) for a @xmath19 kbh ( williams 2003 , 1995 ) .",

    "it had been predicted ( leiter & kafatos 1978 ) that pairs with energies ( @xmath491 gev ) could escape .",

    ". these initial four - momenta are consistent in general with the following : theoretical accretion disk models , the threshold energy values for the scattering process to occur , and what brings about the most `` efficient '' energy extraction process [ see williams ( 1995 ) for details defining the efficiencies ] .",
    "these initial momenta are substituted into appropriate theoretical analytically derived model equations ( describing the penrose scattering process in the ergosphere of a kerr black hole ; see williams 1995 ) , and the equations are computed .",

    "8@xmath18 of williams 2003 ) .",
    "the observed spectra of both these sources can be explained by these penrose processes and the assumed accretion model : specified in   [ sec : model ] [ see williams ( 1995 , 2003 ) for further details ] . as we can see from figure  1@xmath18",

    "we find the following ( williams 2003 ) : the shape of the observed spectrum of 3c  273 looks like the `` enhanced '' ( i.e. , the highest observed energetic state ) spectrum of 3c  279 , except for the higher luminosities in 3c  279 and the radio tail in 3c  273 . the higher luminosity and the apparent lack of a radio tail in 3c  279",
    "is probably , largely , due to the radiation of 3c  279 being beamed more in the direction of the observer than the radiation of 3c  273 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of 3c  279 has been doppler blueshifted to an _ observed _ higher energy interval ; and the _ apparent _ luminosity has been increased .",
    "this is consistent with radio observations which detect more superluminal motion ( or relativistic beaming near the line of sight of the observer ) in 3c  279 than in 3c  273 ( porcas 1987 ) . on the other hand",

    "the hotter state of the accretion disk ( ion corona ) , which is heated by a runaway thermal instability ( shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ) , would result in enhanced penrose processes [ pcs and ppp ( @xmath0 ) ] , and enhanced synchrotron radiation due to the presence of more relativistic electrons , particularly if eilek s ( eilek 1980 ; eilek & kafatos 1983 ) particle reactions ( @xmath257 ) occur , hence contributing to the prominent observed radio tail of 3c  273 .",
    "this ion corona / adaf state , existing in conjunction with the thin disk , appears to be the case always in the continuum emission of 3c  273 and sometimes in the emission spectrum of 3c  279 , with 3c  279 not quite achieving the full `` hot '' ion corona / adaf status of 3c  273 ( williams 2003 ) , neither achieving the full `` cool '' @xmath258  kev thin disk phase , where more penrose processes would occur to liberate trapped energy .",
    "thus in summary , the differences in the spectra of 3c  279 and 3c  273 are probably due to ( 1 ) the more beaming effect in 3c  279 , and ( 2 ) the predominantly extreme hot , cool phases of 3c  273 .",

    "recent radio observations of active galaxy m87 ( junor et al . 1999 ) suggest that electromagnetic collimation becomes important at radii @xmath283 , wherein the initial `` open angle '' of the jet @xmath284 ( at radii @xmath285 ) is made smaller to @xmath286 by the electromagnetic field , where @xmath287 ( @xmath288 , the radius of the ergosphere at the equator ) .",
    "this is consistent with the penrose mechanism providing ( in addition to the relativistic particles ) the initial collimation at radii ( @xmath285 ) , i.e. , closer to the black hole .",
    "since m87 is a giant elliptical galaxy , this could mean that its geometric configuration is possibly helping to maintain the initial collimation by the black hole ( williams 2003 ) : which begins at @xmath289 , and must extend out to at least @xmath290i.e .",
    ", until , it appears , electromagnetic collimation takes over .",
    "however , before one can say for certain of the electromagnetic processes occurring , a time dependent mhd evolution of the penrose escaping particle plasma must be performed ( presently under investigation by the author ) .",
    "it should not be ruled out that the intrinsic collimation due to the black hole , of the escaping relativistic plasma : and any associated `` dynamo '' generated magnetic field , may be sufficient to maintain collimation .",
    "further , concerning m87 , its observed spectrum in general can be explain by the penrose mechanism presented in this paper .",
    "some observational properties of m87 are the following ( eilek 1997 ) : @xmath291 ; striking comparisons of radio ( very large array ) and optical ( hubble space telescope ) images of the jet ; optical and possibly x - ray emission believed to be of synchrotron origin ; and more recently , the mid - ir observations ( perlman et al . 2001 ) showing that the nuclear ir emission is entirely consistent with synchrotron radiation , and there is no evidence for thermal emission from a dusty nuclear torus .",
    "based on these properties the following scenario can be devised according to the penrose - williams mechanism .",
    "the jet is no doubt beamed , since observed superluminal motions give apparent velocities up to @xmath292 , implying line - of - sight angle @xmath293 , bulk lorentz factor @xmath294 , jet doppler factor @xmath295 , and jet brightness boost @xmath296 , respectively ( biretta , sparks , & macchetto 1999 ; see also williams 2003 ) .",
    "m87 is probably an evolve blazar - type agn ( ovv quasar and bl lac object ) .",
    "its luminosity spectrum ( although less powerful , less energetic ) most likely resembles that of 3c  279 (   [ sec:3c273 ] ; see also williams 2003 ) .",
    "the most noticeable change in the spectrum from times past is probably the lack of high energy @xmath8-rays : due to the lack of the availability of infalling low energy ( soft x - ray ) disk photons , or the lack of high energy ppp ( @xmath0 ) electrons , to undergo effective spcs , that would result in escaping trajectories for the scattered @xmath8-rays .",
    "since the jet of m87 is still seen prominently in the radio / optical / x - ray , an optically thin hot ion torus , pcs , ppp ( @xmath0 ) , and subsequently synchrotron radiation of the ppp electrons ( particularly into the optical : implying @xmath297  mev for @xmath298  g , respectively ) , are consistent with the observations .",
    "the parenthetical statement above suggests that the magnetic field producing the synchrotron radiation may be that of the escaping penrose plasma rather than that of the popular proposed large scale dipolar - like field of the accretion disk ( since large - scale , large - strength dipolar accretion disk fields are in practice difficult to create ) ; this however requires an investigation .",
    "moreover , besides coming from the inner region of a relativistic thin disk ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) , there are two possibilities for producing the observed soft x - ray emission , within the confinements of the penrose - williams mechanism : ( 1 ) a synchrotron origin requires electron energies @xmath113  gev ( @xmath299 ) for @xmath50  kev emission at @xmath271  g , and could very well be produced by the ppp ( @xmath0 ) , at least for ultrarelativistic @xmath9 pairs up to @xmath3  gev ( williams 2003 ) for @xmath300 as low as @xmath83  g ; and ( 2 ) the jet is beamed , and self - compton scattering of lower energy radio and ir synchrotron photons by the escaping , intrinsically polar collimated ppp electrons is occurring : the observed energies of the inverse / self - compton scattered photons are blueshifted due to doppler boosting into the optical and x - ray regimes , respectively , according to @xmath301 ( dermer , schlickeiser , & mastichiadis 1992 ) for @xmath302 , @xmath303 .",
    "now , both items above could equally occur , more or less ; however , since superluminal motion appears to be important in m87 , item  ( 2 ) is most likely the dominant , somewhat ruling out the other item .",
    "if this dominance is true , then the energies of the jet electrons need only be as high as @xmath304  mev for @xmath271  g. this is consistent with the penrose processes described here , in the presence of a thin disk / ion corona accretion  without the need of eilek s @xmath85",
    "decays to populate the photon orbit ( see   [ sec : energy - luminosity ] , items @xmath305 ) .",
    "note , such ion coronas or tori are poor radiators , and expected to be of relatively low density , with @xmath306  kev ; this may account for the lack of evidence for an inner `` dusty '' torus emitting thermal radiation in the mid - ir observations by perlman et al .",
    "however , it still seems unlikely that such a low electron energy and particle density ion torus ( or adaf ) can be jet fuel for the bz - type models near the event horizon , inside the ergosphere , as required by such models ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "[ see williams ( 2003 ) for a complete description of the accretion disk model consistent with these penrose processes and observations .",

    "2000 ) might be important at @xmath307 , as suggested by observations ( junor et al . 1999 ) , particularly if the penrose - williams particles are used as fuel .",
    "the penrose - williams model presented here applies to all mass size kbhs , with the stellar mass black hole appearing as a scaled - down supermassive hole .",
    "when the parameters are expressed in gravitational units ( @xmath308 ) , the penrose process emission energy - momentum spectra ( @xmath309 vs.  @xmath40 ; @xmath38 vs.  @xmath40 ; @xmath310 vs.  @xmath40 ) over the range of masses are approximately identical .",

    "for example , the observations of the classical stellar / galactic black - hole candidate cygnus x-1 ( liang 1998 ) can be explained by these penrose processes : processes consistent with cyg x-1 have model parameters for radial infalling photons ( @xmath191  kev ) from a thin disk ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) , that either undergo pcs by equatorially confined orbiting target electrons ( @xmath53  mev ) at @xmath12 or ppp ( @xmath262 ) at @xmath147 .",

    "this is consistent with mhd that the behavior of such individual particles on geometry ( or gravity)-induced trajectories is also that of the bulk of fluid elements in the guiding center approximation ( de felice & zanotti 2000 ) . in light of this , with some ease , mhd should be incorporated into these calculations , particularly to describe the flow of the penrose escaping particles away from the black hole , to perhaps further collimate and accelerate these jet particles out to the observed distances .",
    "importantly , we can conclude that , the difference between quasars , radio quiet and radio loud galaxies , and microquasars , appears to be the presence or the lack of a two - temperature adaf : with or without nuclear reactions ( @xmath349 ) in the inner region of the accretion disk ( see eilek 1980 ; eilek & kafatos 1983 ) .",

    "the microquasars , on the other hand , appear in general not to satisfy conditions for the existence of an adaf , which is determined by the accretion rate ( williams & hjellming 2002 ) , but do appear to satisfy conditions to have a soft x - ray inner region and an apparent thermal - cycle instability , with disk temperature up to @xmath102  kev .    finally , what makes the penrose mechanism described here so admirable is that it allows one to relate the macroscopic conditions , i.e. , of the global gravitational field of the kbh , to the microscopic world of particle physics .",

    "the physics used in this penrose analysis is that of special and general relativity . from this analysis and its consistency with observations ,",
    "we arrive at the following conclusion : close to the event horizon , gravity and particle - particle interactions , in the ergosphere , of highly curved spacetime ( where the effect of the external accretion disk magnetic field is apparently negligible ) , are sufficient to described energy - momentum extraction from a rotating black hole .",

    "2001 ; krolik 2000 ) .",
    "however , the first detailed numerical relativistic time - dependent mhd calculations in a kerr metric ( koide et al . 2000 ; meier & koide 2000 ; meier , koide , & uchida 2001 ) show that in order for magnetic field lines to extend inward to the numerical limited radius @xmath354being frozen to the plasma , of keplerian velocity , the disk material must be initially counter rotating : opposite the direction that the black hole is rotating .",
    "this appears inconsistent with the observations of zhang , cui , & chen ( 1997 ) and in general the physics occurring inside the ergosphere in which inertial frames are dragged in the direction that the black hole is rotating .",
    "even though we know that particles can have retrograde orbits inside the ergosphere , relative to an observer at infinity , it is highly improbable that the whole disk of matter will be counter rotating , at least in the general sense .",
    "further , it appears that the net rotational energy being `` extracted '' in the numerical simulation of these authors ( koide et al .",
    "2000 ) in the form of electromagnetic energy over and above the gravitational binding energy released due to the hydrodynamic energy transported into the black hole is merely the rotational energy from the nonphysical initial condition that the accretion disk plasma is counter rotating as it falls into the ergosphere . ) !",
    "not only is this an untrue statement , but it is a violation of the laws of physics . the frame dragging circular velocity inside the ergosphere as measured by an observer at infinity is @xmath355 ( see bardeen et al . 1972 ; misner et al .",
    "1973 ; thorne et al . 1986 ; williams 1995 ; see also   [ sec : cyg ] ) . ] on the other hand , for a co - rotating disk these authors found that the inward limiting radius is even larger ( @xmath356 ) , attributed to a centrifugal barrier ( koide et al .",
    "although this time - dependent mhd model is an excellent representation of subrelativistic ( @xmath357 ) jet formation in a kbh magnetosphere , the inconsistencies of this mhd model , as matter nears the event horizon ( @xmath358 ) , is probably an indication of the limitation , of such fluid dynamical models , in describing energy extraction from a rotating black hole : this being based on the guiding center approximation , wherein the single - particle approach is essential close to the black hole ( de felice & carlotto 1997 ; de felice & zanotti 2000 ) , i.e. , the behavior of individual particles is also that of the bulk of fluid elements .",
    "this means that gravitational - particle interactions , such as the penrose processes describe here ( in this paper ) , are required .",
    "note , in these penrose processes , which occur close to the event horizon , elementary electromagnetic and atomic forces dominate on the microscopic scale , while gravity is dominant on the macroscopic scale  thus , as it should be in the strong gravitational potential well of the kbh ; but far away from @xmath359 electromagnetism appears to dominate macroscopically ( junor , biretta , & livio 1999 ) .",
    "moreover , stability of the co - rotating disk , falling inward to the limiting radius @xmath356 , at the keplerian velocity , when magnetic field lines are coupled to the infalling plasma , with the jet formation similar to that of the schwarzchild black hole case ( koide , shibata , & kudoh 1999 ) , suggests that the large scale magnetic field plays a dominant role at large distances from @xmath359 , irrespective of whether or not the black hole is rotating .",
    "in addition , these numerical inward limiting radii , at least in the case of the counter - rotating disk ( @xmath346 ) , may also be a display of the horizon being a `` vacuum infinity '' ( punsly & coroniti 1989 ; punsly 1991 ; williams 2003 ) : to the associated magnetic field charge neutral disk particle plasma , in accordance with the `` no - hair '' theorem ( carter 1973 ; misner , thorne , & wheeler 1973 ; williams 1995 ) , suggesting that the interaction of the disk magnetic field with particles in bound , trapped orbits at radii @xmath353 is negligible compared to the penrose gravitational - particle interactions described here .",

    "however , there exist problems in generating sufficient @xmath366 parallel to the polar direction ( @xmath367 axis ) ; none of the polar mhd models of this particular type adequately gets rid of this problem .",
    "magnetic reconnection may be a solution to some degree .",
    "\\3 . to get around problems in items 1 and 2 (",
    "specifically , the large strength field required and the vacuum infinity horizon ) it is assumed that a `` hot '' ion corona or torus - like accretion can provide the necessary jet particles : ( @xmath18 ) for the magnetosphere to act on , accelerating and collimating through centrifugal driving winds ( see below ) ; and ( @xmath64 ) to provide the hot ram pressure , to `` ram '' the magnetic field lines inward to the event horizon",
    ". however , now there appears to be a problem concerning how to liberate particles from trapped orbits inside the ergosphere ( particularly in the plunging regime ) onto escaping orbits .",
    "particles in the plunging regime , as defined by bardeen , press , and teukolsky ( 1972 ) , i.e. , massless and material particles ( with @xmath368 ) originating from infinity , can only escape , by being injected onto escaping orbits by some physically process near the black hole  such as the penrose scattering processes described here  since nothing can come out of the hole ( bardeen et al .",
    "therefore , the bz - type models are faced with yet another problem , as the magnetic field is assumed to get closer to the kbh : where general relativistic effects must be considered , i.e. , how do we get the necessary escaping particles in numbers out of the ergospheric region ( @xmath353 ) into the jets by such models ? moreover , with observations showing m87 not having the expected large `` dusty '' thermal ir - emitting torus ( perlman et al . 2001 ) that could have possibly served as particle jet `` fuel '' for a bz - type model , the penrose mechanism to extract energy momentum , as described by williams ( 1995 ) , the so - called penrose - williams mechanism , appears to be the only possible , plausible way to power this agn , and thus , generate its jets (   [ sec : m87 ] ) .",
    "so , in summary , in addition to the problems above associated with the bz - type mhd models , there still exists the historical problem : how does one convert from electromagnetic energy to the particle energies observed in the jets , emanating from the region where energy is observed to be extracted , i.e. , inside the ergosphere close to the event horizon ?",
    "none of the existing bz - type mhd models thus far adequately solves this `` age - old '' problem .",
    "\\4 . in the centrifugal driven winds ( blandford & payne 1982 ) mentioned above",
    ", the following is assumed : if the disk magnetic field lines subtends an angle of more than @xmath369 to the rotation axis , the gas will be flung away from the disk into collimated jets with speeds a few times the escape velocity at the magnetic footprint on the disk .",
    "now , this may be true at @xmath370 , but near the event horizon @xmath359 , the escape conditions ( see williams 1995 ) must be adequately applied .",
    "recently , a general relativistic mhd treatment of evolving tori that includes in some degree features of the blandford & payne ( 1982 ) type - models , which allow for centrifugal driven winds to power the jets ( hirose et al .",
    "2004 ; de villiers , hawley , & krolik 2004 ; de villiers , hawley , & krolik 2003 ) , found no such appreciable relativistic winds emerging from the horizon , nor the so - called plunging region , nor the ergospheric accretion disk that could be tied directly to rotational energy extraction from the black hole , although it was found that the lorentz force inside the ergosphere increased due to inertial frame dragging .",
    "the plunging region for @xmath371 lacked adequate resolution , suggesting perhaps the need for a general relativistic particle geodesic treatment , according to the guiding center approximation ( discussed in item  1 of this appendix ; see also williams 2003 ) .",
    "these mhd calculations ( hirose et al .",
    "2004 ; de villiers et al . 2004 ; de villiers et al .",
    "2003 ) did , however , confirm the existence of the predicted funnel region ( rees et  al .",
    "1982 ; see williams 2003 ) , and are consistent with the evolved magnetic field configuration found by bik ( 2000 ) and bik & ledvinka ( 2000 ) , i.e. , that radial lines are expelled from the surrounding equatorial region ( @xmath372 ) , but at the poles @xmath373 .",
    "this clearly shows that the classical bz - type models ( blandford & znajek 1997 ) , where magnetic field lines are proposed to anchor to the event horizon , thereby extracting rotational energy , could not be an important source , because @xmath372 in the region of importance for extracting rotational energy . also these mhd calculations seem to confirm the importance of magnetic fields on a large scale , in gravitational accretion processes , i.e. , in aiding mass outflows to large distances in the jets of black holes as well as those of protostars ( see williams 2004 ) .",
    "\\5 . finally , to clear up any confusion , the authors of the historical paper ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) loosely called the bz - type models the penrose effect  the very name for years that had distinguished williams",
    "( 1991 , 1995 , 1999 , 2001 ) internationally known successful four - dimensional penrose model ( see also piran & shaham 1977 ; leiter & kafatos 1978 ; kafatos & leiter 1979 ; kafatos 1980 ; wagh & dadhich 1989 ) from the bz - type models .",
    "strangely , these authors did not reference williams investigation .",
    "nevertheless , to set the record straight , the penrose mechanism [ as summarized here and described in detail in williams ( 1995 ) ] , which involves gravitational extraction of energy from a spinning black hole , based on that visualized by penrose ( 1969 ) , and that of the so - called bz mechanism , which involves electromagnetic extraction of energy ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) , are two very different models .",
    "so different that the statement made by the authors in wilms et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , `` for parameters relevant to our discussion , the extra energy source is provided by the spin via the penrose effect occurring within the radius of marginal stability ( but outside of the stretched horizon ) , '' indeed requires a proper reference , since williams ( 1991 , 1995 ) model is popularly known as the only existing completely worked out model of the penrose mechanism : occurring within the radius of marginal stability @xmath13 . whatever the case may be , the recent observations of mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) and m87 ( perlman et al . 2001 ) introduce compelling evidence suggesting that perhaps it is the effects of williams black hole source model that is being observed ( as described in this paper ) , and hardly those of the bz - type models .",
    "the evidence presented here strongly suggests that observed black hole sources have a central energy generation similar the mechanism described in this present paper .",
    "so , to avoid any further confusion , it seems appropriate to refer to williams model as the penrose - williams mechanism , which i interchangeably refer to as just the penrose mechanism , out of respect for its originator penrose ( 1969 ) .",
