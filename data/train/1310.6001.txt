    "the classification of possible phases of matter is at the heart of condensed matter physics .",
    "conventionally this is linked to the notion of symmetry breaking characterized by a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value of certain local order parameters .",
    "examples include the superconducting gap function or the magnetization vector .    in the past decade",
    "it has become evident that this is not the whole story .",
    "different integer quantum hall phases for example exhibit different macroscopic physics ( in particular , their hall conductivity ) while all of them appear like a structureless electron liquid on the microscopic level @xcite . in a seminal paper @xcite ,",
    "thouless et al . argued that the distinction between these phases can not be made with a local order parameter , but can be captured by a non - local quantity  a topological invariant that is obtained by integrating berry flux over the brillouin zone .",
    "hence the names ` topological orders ' or ` topological phases of matter ' which are now commonly used to describe such phases that can not be captured by local order parameters .",
    "a lot of progress has been made identifying such topological order parameters for different systems . for free fermion systems",
    "this has led to an elegant ` periodic table'-like classification @xcite , containing phases of matter such as the quantum spin hall state @xcite , the integer quantum hall state and the @xmath4 superconductor .",
    "more generally the quest for observables that identify the type of topological order has spawned among others such quantities as topological entanglement entropies and spectra , whereas we have in previous work@xcite proposed the topological @xmath0-matrix .",
    "one particular class of interacting topological phases has received an extraordinary amount of attention : those with anyonic excitations in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions , not the least because they have been proposed as a way to realize fault - tolerant quantum computing @xcite . from a field theory point of view",
    "two families of models have been identified : chern - simons theories , which are closely related to the mathematics of knot theory and the jones polynomial @xcite , and discrete gauge theories @xcite , of which kitaev s toric code@xcite is a close relative .",
    "different lattice realizations of ( non - chiral varieties of ) these theories have been constructed , for example levin - wen models @xcite or discrete lattice gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the study of the phase structure of an anyon model can be pursued along two complementary directions .",
    "first , one could start from a lattice model and add perturbing terms to its hamiltonian .",
    "these terms can drive a phase transition in the system which can be studied using monte carlo methods @xcite , perturbative expansions @xcite or mappings to exactly solvable models @xcite .",
    "some of these phase transitions can be attributed to the formation of a bose condensate in the original theory .",
    "much of the physics of these transitions is independent of the underlying lattice realization and this opens up a second approach taking the knowledge of the topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) as a starting point .",
    "it turns out that from that topological data one can indeed determine the low - energy effective tqft in the presence of the bosonic condensate  and this is the program we pursue further in this paper . for discrete gauge theories ( dgts ) , where the particle sectors can be understood as irreducible representations ( irreps ) of an underlying quantum group @xcite ( the quantum double @xmath5 of a finite group @xmath6 ) , it amounts to a higgs - type effect and as such is really a case of symmetry breaking : the quantum group gets reduced and the low - energy tqft is given by the irreps of this smaller quantum group @xcite . for cs theories",
    "the situation is more complex : these too can be understood in terms of quantum groups @xcite  quantum deformations of @xmath7  but identifying the tqft after bose condensation is more involved . in ref .",
    "this problem was tackled , not by looking at the group explicitly , but rather by studying the breaking on the level of the fusion algebra of the excitations .",
    "it was shown that by demanding that the bose condensate acts as a vacuum sector and requiring commutativity and associativity of the fusion algebra , an effective theory in the condensed phase can often be identified .",
    "however , what was found was a consistent fusion algebra  but not the full set of all tqft data for the condensed phase .",
    "in particular , the @xmath3- matrices that implement an associator on the level of the fusion spaces were not derived in this framework .",
    "also were there some cases where the identification of the broken phase remained ambiguous .",
    "the present work aims to fill in that gap .",
    "we show how the fusion spaces in the condensed theory and its parent theory are related . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a new set of numbers called vertex lifting coefficients ( vlcs ) and we show how the full set of topological data in the bose condensed phase can be expressed in terms of the topological data of the original phase and these vlcs .",
    "we also provide a scheme to calculate these numbers explicitly for a number of examples . as a byproduct",
    "all ambiguities are in principle removed . from a physics point of view , this work is relevant for a number of reasons .",
    "first , it is theoretically pleasing to extend the method of ref .   to include all topological data and allow for the expression of all operators using only data of the unbroken theory",
    "this provides a much deeper understanding of bose condensation in the context of topological phases .",
    "it turns out that fixing a more precise set of consistency conditions has subtle consequences .",
    "for example , not all condensates that one would naively consider are actually allowed and we show in an example how this follows from an easy consistency check . in the same time many links to other topics become clear , in pure maths as discussed below , but more importantly also to other important notions in the study of topological phases , such as levin - wen models@xcite and patterns of long - range entanglement@xcite , where the same structures as here appear .",
    "a particular benefit of the current approach is that all operators are lifted to the hilbert space of the parent phase making .",
    "this makes the connection to lattice studies much simpler . in earlier work @xcite  a numerical study of discrete gauge theories on a lattice  we found that the correct identification of observables in the broken phase needs coefficients we now identify as the vlcs .",
    "this was solved in an _ ad hoc _ manner at the time , but the vlcs clearly provide the correct quantities for the general case and should show up in similar studies .    determining the @xmath3- and @xmath2-matrices of a theory from scratch , starting from the fusion algebra is a daunting task : it involves solving the pentagon and hexagon equations and has only been done for theories with a handful of different particles ( see ref .  ) . at the same time",
    "the @xmath3-symbols serve as the input for levin - wen lattice models@xcite which play an important role in the study of topological phases .",
    "these models of effective string - net degrees of freedom provide fixed point hamiltonians and wavefunctions for a large class of topological orders .",
    "the present work presents a route for obtaining a whole family of consistent fusion data starting from a parent theory by condensing the bosons in the theory .",
    "this forms an alternative route to quantum group methods @xcite and can give access to more exotic theories .",
    "an important open question is to what extend the universal properties of the critical points separating topological phases are determined by the topological order on either side .",
    "microscopic studies indicate interesting universality classes @xcite ,",
    "but the inherent nonlocality of the orderparameters obstructs the adaptation of conventional field theoretical methods to study _ e.g _",
    "critical exponents .",
    "it remains to be seen if the algebraic structure of tqft can be exploited to build a theory for the critical behavior , but we envision the present work to play an important role in future progress .    in a similar category fall questions concerning universal topological quantum computation ( utqc ) in the condensed phase .",
    "this and similar questions clearly needs knowledge of the operators of the broken theory and not just the particle content .",
    "more model independent considerations also fall in the general scope of the present work .    the formalism presented in this",
    "work is easily adapted to other contexts .",
    "as an example we point the extensive use of the notions we present from a preprint of the present work in a recent formulation for a unified framework for topological phases with symmetry@xcite .",
    "a rigorous mathematical analysis of some of what we present here , goes back to work of kirillov and ostrik @xcite .",
    "the consistency conditions on the condensate which we formulate turn out to be equivalent to the definition of a commutative seperable frobenius algebra in the context of unitary braided tensor categories . in ref .",
    "kong identifies this as the relevant mathematical structure for anyon condensation by performing a bootstrap analysis based on physically justifiable assumptions , and as such forms an interesting bridge between the physical and mathematical literature . in the mathematics or mathematical physics literature , the study of ( commutative ) frobenius algebras in the context of tensor categories has received considerable attention , both abstractly  @xcite and in relation to boundaries and defects in cfts and tqfts  @xcite . in the work presented here",
    "we develop a diagrammatic formalism based on the clear physical picture of condensation , reducing the heavy language of the underlying mathematics to a minimum .",
    "this exceeds earlier approaches in being both simple and intuitive and in the same time completely general and computationally powerful .",
    "indeed , this is much facilitated by the introduction of the vlcs , which to our knowledge have up to now not been exploited in the literature .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.cond ] we give a more extensive introduction to anyons in the presence of a bose condensate .",
    "we outline the general properties of the condensation transition and the topological symmetry breaking scheme for condensation .",
    "we then discuss the graphical formalism for anyon models and the relation of anyon condensation to other topics in physics and mathematics . in sec .",
    "[ sec : diagrams ] we go into the details of topological symmetry breaking .",
    "first we recap how the topological order of the broken phase can be obtained on the level of the particle sectors .",
    "then we reformulate the scheme in a graphical language leading to the full diagrammatics for bose condensation in anyon theories .",
    "it is shown that the fusion properties of the condensate play an important role and we formulate the precise conditions on the condensate in order to obtain a consistent theory .",
    "it is discussed how the characteristic features of topological symmetry breaking phase transitions ",
    "identification , splitting and confinement  appear in this language .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the vertex lifting coefficients ( vlcs ) as the crucial ingredient to lift the vertices of the theory .",
    "this is the data needed to completely characterize the topological properties of the phase transition including the mapping between the operator spaces of the theory .",
    "it is explained how they allow one to calculate the full set of topological data of the broken phase , including @xmath3- and @xmath2-matrices .",
    "section  [ sec.diaglift ] discusses precisely how to lift arbitrary diagrams from the broken phase to the original phase such that general observables from the broken phase can be computed .",
    "important is the explicit occurrence of vacuum exchange lines ( vels ) to incorporate the interaction with the condensate .",
    "the quantum dimension diagram and the topological @xmath0-matrix are discussed as simple applications of this protocol .",
    "the actual calculation of the vlcs is presented in section  [ sec.calc_vlcs ] .",
    "two classes of condensates are worked out in full : one component condensates with and without a triple - vacuum vertex .",
    "an example of each case is worked out in detail .",
    "we also show from the consistency conditions that an expected condensate in five layers of fibonacci anyons actually will not occur .",
    "after that , we conclude and present some ideas for future research . in the appendix a short but complete introduction into anyon models , as well as",
    "the topological data for @xmath8 theories and a full list of consistency conditions for the vlcs is presented .",
    "in this paper we study bose condensates in a system with anyonic particle - like excitations . in other words , by some mechanism that is beyond the scope of the present work one or more bosonic sectors in phase @xmath9 have gained a vacuum expectation value and we want to determine the effective physics in the presence of the condensate .",
    "this determination is done in two steps :    1 .",
    "[ item:1 ] we first achieve consistent fusion resulting in an algebra called @xmath10 .",
    "[ item:2 ] then we project out sectors that are confined due to nontrivial braiding with the condensate resulting in a braided theory for the bulk in the broken phase called @xmath11 .",
    "this scheme , known as topological symmetry breaking ( tsb ) , can thus be abbreviated as @xmath12 a detailed account can be found in ref .",
    ", with many worked out examples of the resulting mapping on the level of the particle sectors of the theory .",
    "an important question left unanswered in this previous work is how the tsb scheme extends to the topological hilbert space and operators of the theory .",
    "our current aim is to revisit the tsb scheme , explicitly including the topological hilbert space and operators in the discussion .",
    "the above scenario has a certain common ground with spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories and the landau paradigm of second order phase transitions . in stark contrast",
    ", however , there is no local field that features as an order parameter for the broken phase .",
    "this should not be surprising as it is precisely the absence of local order parameters and the defiance of the landau paradigm that have spurred the interest in topological phases in the first place .",
    "due to the inherent non - locality of topological phases , conventional field theoretical methods fail to study topological phase transitions but the algebraic structures present in tqft allow one to make progress .",
    "quantum groups play an important role this respect .",
    "they can account for the exotic fusion and braiding properties of anyons through their representation theory and it is tempting view the the anyons as representation modules of a quantum group , even if there are no apparent internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this suggests the mechanism of quantum group symmetry breaking for phase transitions .",
    "indeed , this is precisely the idea underlying the formalism in ref .   and the present work .",
    "it turns out , however , that in practice one can forget about the underlying symmetry algebra and work directly on the level of the excitations .",
    "formally , this means that will work with braided tensor categories and modular tensor categories ( mtcs ) in particular , which encode the algebraic structure present in tqfts and rational cfts@xcite .",
    "the heavy mathematical language customarily used in the study of mtcs is not very appealing for applications in physics . in the spirit of kitaev",
    "s paper @xcite we will therefore get rid of many of the formalities but use a graphical formalism containing all the important structure ( also called _ anyon models _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let us outline the main aspects of the graphical formalism at this point .",
    "a concise but complete introduction can be found in appendix  [ sec.rules ] . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to refs .  .",
    "the idea is to use diagrams to represent the operators that implement the fusion and braiding of anyons , together with rules for evaluation .",
    "each anyonic charge @xmath13 ( we generally use indices @xmath14 for anyon types of @xmath15 ) can label a directed line segment which can be thought of as the world line of an anyon with charge @xmath16 .",
    "three lines can meet in trivalent vertices representing the fusion or splitting of the anyons .",
    "furthermore , lines can be crossing over or underneath each other representing the braiding of anyons .",
    "the elementary building blocks of any diagram are therefore @xmath17 vertices are only nonzero when the combination @xmath18 is allowed by the fusion rules @xmath19 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath20 ) .",
    "the fusion coefficients @xmath21 are nonnegative integers in general , but we consider only @xmath22 ( otherwise an extra label on the vertex should distinguish the different fusion states ) .    the topological hilbert space spanned by a collection of anyons has a dimension equal to the number of inequivalent ways one can fuse all the anyons back to the vacuum ( assuming overall charge neutrality ) . for the case of a large number of anyons of type @xmath16 , the dimension per anyon asymptotically approaches the largest eigenvalue @xmath23 of the fusion matrix @xmath24 ( with coefficients @xmath25 ) , and @xmath23 is called the quantum dimension of @xmath16 .",
    "it also has the diagrammatic expression @xmath26 every anyonic charge in the theory has a unique conjugate charge with which it may annihilate @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the unique vacuum charge .",
    "vacuum lines in diagrams are generally left invisible , or when made explicit we draw them dotted .",
    "the reason is of course that vacuum lines can be added and removed at will since the vacuum has trivial fusion and braiding .",
    "the precise graphical conditions defining the triviality of the vacuum will play an important role in this work .",
    "since we want to study condensates of bosons within anyon theories , we will be particularly interested in anyons that have trivial spin .",
    "the topological spin factor @xmath29 can be used in diagrams to remove twists corresponding to a @xmath30 rotation of the anyon ( in that sense the world lines should be thought of as ribbons rather than lines ) .",
    "the original tsb scheme  @xcite was developed such that only knowledge of the fusion coefficients @xmath21 , quantum dimensions @xmath23 and spin @xmath31 is required .",
    "accordingly , one is only able to reconstruct the analogous data for the broken phase .",
    "the full topological data of an anyon model is captured by the so called @xmath3-symbols and @xmath2-symbols , encoding the fusion braid properties respectively .",

    "the physics of bose condensation in anyon theories has many ties to topics in mathematics and physics of current interest .",

    "a detailed discussion can be found relating topological ( quantum group ) symmetry breaking to constructions in conformal field theory such as conformal embeddings , the coset construction and orbifolds .",
    "it is argued that breaking down the quantum group by condensation of a bosonic sector is dual to enlarging the ( local ) chiral algebra . as many aspects of the aforementioned cft constructions can be understood in terms of chiral algebra extensions ,",
    "this provides a physical reinterpretation of these constructions in terms of bose condensation .",
    "the mathematics underlying this paper has been introduced in ref .   where a connection was made to the mckay correspondence@xcite .",
    "this is important to the classification problem for cfts@xcite , and possibly even mostreous moonshine@xcite or generalizations thereof@xcite , but we will not dwell on such abstract topics here .",
    "the same structures have also been used in the description of boundary conditions and topological defects in cft @xcite . on the other hand",
    "there have been studies on the effects of nontrivial boundaries in lattice realizations of topological order based on kitaev s quantum double model @xcite and levin - wen models @xcite .",
    "the latter works consistently find that nontrivial boundary conditions can be a source of condensation with consequences very similar to the tsb scheme .",
    "that the two topics are intimately related also shows from the connection between condensation and the protection of gapless edge modes@xcite which linked to the absence of a lagrangian subgroup in the fusion algebra , the definition of which clearly is a special case of our definition for a condensate ( see also  ) .",
    "it is an intriguing fact that lattice formulation of topological order like levin - wen models always realize non - chiral theories . in the simplest case where one starts with the @xmath3-symbols of a fully braided mtc / anyon model @xmath15 as input for the model ,",
    "the topological order is described by the double @xmath54 . if one however starts with a theory that admits consistent fusion but no consistent braiding such as @xmath55 , one ends up with the so called quantum double or drinfeld center @xmath56 .",
    "apparently the model knows if a certain set of @xmath3-symbols _ admits _ a consistent set of @xmath2-symbols or not .",
    "the properties of the quasi - particles and how the resulting topological order emerges are less obvious in this case .",
    "this question has received additional attention recently @xcite . in this",
    "context explicit examples of @xmath3-symbols that do not allow a compatible braiding structure are quite interesting , for example for computational studies . the tsb scheme produces naturally a nonbraided theory , namely @xmath55 , and the present work provides the necessary tools to calculate these @xmath3-symbols explicitly .",
    "there is a list of topics in the context of topological phases in condensed matter for which the precise connection with tsb is worth exploring further .",
    "for example the interplay with conventional symmetries and symmetry breaking , in particular for symmetry protected and symmetry enriched topological phases@xcite .",
    "recently , the formalism of condensate induced transitions has been used in a completely different context , namely to find solvable one - dimensional spin hamiltonians of which the cfts for the critical behaviour follow the topological symmetry breaking scheme @xcite .",
    "in this section we construct the diagrammatic theory for bose condensates in a system of anyons , but first we review the original tsb scheme .      the aim of the tsb protocol is to find the effective theory @xmath55 with particle labels @xmath57 together with the branching or restriction coefficients @xmath58 under the assumption that one or more bosonic sectors @xmath59 of the unbroken phase @xmath15 form a condensate .",
    "the branching coefficients implement a map characterizing the phase transition which we call restriction : @xmath60 the name restriction originates from thinking about @xmath16 as a representation of some algebra @xmath61 that branches into smaller representations if the algebra that acts on the representation is restricted to some subalgebra @xmath62 .",
    "the same coefficients provide the adjoint of the restriction map , which we call the lift @xmath63 the question of which particles can actually condense is highly nontrivial in the context of notrivial braid statistics .",
    "even if a particle has trivial spin @xmath64 , a macroscopic state may not be invariant under interchange of the particles as the spin statistics theorem does not hold in this context . in ref .",
    "the following conditions were proposed    1 .",
    "[ oldtsb1 ] a boson @xmath65 has trivial spin @xmath64 2 .",
    "[ oldtsb2 ] @xmath59 has partial or completely trivial self monodromy    the latter condition is understood as the existence of a fusion channel @xmath66 which has trivial spin itself , @xmath67 .",
    "these conditions are meant to ensure that for every number @xmath41 of the condensed boson @xmath59 there should be a state in the topological hilbert space @xmath68 that is invariant under monodromy of the particles . in the present work",
    "we refine these requirements .",
    "the boson that condenses should have @xmath69 under the restriction map , where @xmath70 is the vacuum of the new theory .",
    "it is postulated that fusion commutes with the restriction map @xmath71 from this simple assumption and properties such as the uniqueness of the vacuum one can deduce that @xmath72 the game of the tsb protocol is now figuring out the particle content @xmath73 and fusion rules of @xmath55 and the restriction coefficients @xmath58 by making smart use of these properties .    at this stage",
    "we denote the theory with @xmath55 since it may still include sectors that braid nontrivially with the condensate .",
    "these will actually not appear in the bulk as free particles as they will pull strings ( domain walls ) in the condensate .",

    "however , we did not yet discuss the fusion properties of the condensate .    to reproduce all properties of a vacuum",

    "we refer the reader who is interested in the mathematics of algebras in tensor categories to ref .",

    "but , as the theory projects diagrams that are not allowed for confined charges automatically to zero , general @xmath55 charges are in fact allowed .",
    "diagrams for physical observables are usually given by a link , corresponding to a vacuum - to - vacuum expectation value .",
    "these diagrams can be read as the creation of a ( set of ) anyons , followed by some braiding pattern and the subsequent annihilation of the anyons .",
    "the proper normalization turns out to be an overall factor of @xmath91 voor vacuum - to - vacuum diagrams , where @xmath179 is the quantum embedding index .",
    "an easy way to establish this is by considering the diagram for the quantum dimensions of the condensate .",
    "clearly , this should evaluate to 1 while a naive evaluation leads to @xmath90 .",
    "one can also say that there should always be an additional condensate line connected to the top and bottom since this is a vacuum - to - vacuum diagram in @xmath74 .",
    "projecting these to the original vacuum @xmath28 also gives the correct factor @xmath91 .      in this step",
    "we make sure that the diagram is connected by attaching vels ( lines labeled by the condensate ) between the otherwise disconnected components .",
    "[ [ necessity - of - vels ] ] necessity of vels + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to see why this is necessary , remember that the conditions on the condensate all basically boiled down to one thing : the new vacuum line should act as a proper vacuum sector , _",
    "i.e. _ one should be able to freely attach vacuum lines to any diagram representing an operator expectation value .",
    "condensate lines starting on and ending on the same single connected component of the diagram can always be removed by applying the vacuum consistency conditions for the broken phase , for example one has the sequence : @xmath180 for vacuum lines connecting two different components the situation is slightly more subtle .",
    "if there are two condensate lines connecting the components , then the endpoints of one of the condensate lines can only be shifted from one component to the other using the second vacuum line : @xmath181 implying that it suffices to only draw single vacuum lines until all components are directly or indirectly connected .",
    "consequently the necessity of the connecting condensate lines can be viewed in two ways .",
    "one way is that , once the connecting vels are in place , we can freely connect other condensate lines as is appropriate for the vacuum .",
    "they can be annihilated by sliding them around until the endpoints meet and we remove the bubble using .",
    "the evaluation of the diagram remains the same .",
    "here we assume that the lines in the diagram are labeled by unconfined charges so that all braidings with the condensate can be undone .",
    "recall that the theory takes care of confined charges in a natural way by projecting diagrams that are not allowed to zero , so there is no loss of generality here . the other way to think about",
    "the necessity of the vels is imagining that we must somehow take into account all imaginable vacuum lines in the diagram .",
    "then , by the same logic , we can always effectively remove them as long the resulting diagram stays connected .",
    "the physical reason for the appearance of the vels is clearly the fact that in the condensed phase , the excitations will unavoidably interact with the condensate .",
    "we call a diagram where all components are connected by condensate lines a _ dressed _ diagram . in previous work@xcite ,",
    "we had already identified such nontrivial contributions to the @xmath0-matrix in a lattice model and dubbed them _ vacuum exchange diagrams_.    [ [ vels - and - linking ] ] vels and linking + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    charge conservation implies that when a diagram that can be separated in two unlinked components , the connection by a vel between the parts is in fact spurious , if we agree to normalize the components by @xmath91 separately .",
    "to see this , first imagine two processes @xmath182 and @xmath183 separated in time , each consisting of a set of creation , braiding and annihilation processes .",
    "these are represented by two separate link diagrams drawn one above the other .",
    "the vertical vel that should be drawn according to the recipe can be removed without changing the evaluation of the diagram @xmath184 this fact is derived from the simple statement that tadpole diagrams evaluate to zero for nontrivial charges , @xmath185 the same reasoning holds for diagrams separated in space , @xmath186 this type of diagram generally portrays operations on spatially separated groups of anyons that do not lead to entanglement between the groups .",
    "hence , we see that the presence of the condensate does not induce entanglement by itself .    for confined charges , the only non - zero diagrams are planar and so here we do not need the vels if we just put in a normalization @xmath91 for all separate components .",
    "this is the step where the present work provides the essential ingredients , such that diagrams can actually be computed .",
    "the diagram in @xmath11 is expanded in the @xmath9 theory by putting in the corresponding superpositions for the labels @xmath165 at the charge lines @xmath187 and , importantly , by putting in the vlcs as coefficients at all the appearing vertices @xmath188 u & v & w \\\\ a & b & c \\end{bmatrix } } {      {      \\def\\objectstyle{\\scriptstyle }      \\def\\labelstyle{\\scriptstyle } } \\xy          ( -4.24,4.24)*{}=\"a \" ;          ( 4.24,4.24)*{}=\"b \" ;          ( 0,-6)*{}=\"c \" ;          ( 0,0)*{}=\"mid \" + ( 2,-1 ) * { } ;          \" mid \" ; \" a \" * * \\dir{-}?(.75)*\\dir { > } + ( -2,0)*{a } ;          \" mid \" ; \" b \" * * \\dir{-}?(.75)*\\dir { > } + ( 2,0)*{b } ;          \" c \" ; \" mid\"**\\dir{-}?(.7)*\\dir{>}+(2,-3)*{c } ;      \\endxy   } .\\ ] ] the vertices can either appear because the original @xmath11 diagram contained vertices or because disconnected components are now connected by vels and thus have a vertex with the condensate .",
