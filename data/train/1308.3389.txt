    "from cosmological observations such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the big - bang - nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) etc , the baryon - to - photon ratio in our universe is found to be  @xcite @xmath5 the two values nicely agree with each other although their relevant time scales are different .",
    "revealing the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) is one of the grand puzzles in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "it is well known that the bau can arise dynamically if the so - called sakharov s conditions are fulfilled  @xcite : ( 1 ) baryon number ( @xmath6 ) violation , ( 2 ) @xmath7 and @xmath4 violation , and ( 3 ) departure from thermal equilibrium . to be consistent with the observations , the bau must arise after inflation if it exists and before the bbn era .",
    "sakharov s conditions can be satisfied in many ways . among others , electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg )",
    "@xcite is an attractive framework since it is intimately related to physics that can be probed by experiments within our reach .",
    "the baryogenesis scenario in the standard model ( sm ) is based on such an ewbg mechanism . however , it turns out that the magnitude of the @xmath4-violating effect coming from the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix is far too small  @xcite , and the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is a smooth crossover  @xcite so that the ewbg mechanism does not work in the sm .",
    "this shortcoming of the sm motivates one to search for new physics .",
    "the ewbg in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) has been well studied so far . however , a light stop scenario , in which the ewpt can be strongly first - order , is currently in tension with the large hadron collider ( lhc ) data  @xcite .",
    "this difficulty may be circumvented in the extended mssm models such as next - to - mssm ( nmssm )  @xcite , nearly mssm ( nmssm )  @xcite , @xmath0-extended mssm ( umssm )  @xcite and its secluded version ( smssm )  @xcite since the light stop is not necessarily required to have the strong first - order ewpt . in the nmssm , the so - called type - b ewpt  @xcite corresponds to such a case . to realize it ,",
    "@xmath8 may be needed , where @xmath9 denotes the coupling constant between the higgs doublet and singlet fields , and @xmath10 is a trilinear coupling constant of the singlet higgs field . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is demonstrated that the superpartner of the singlet higgs boson , which is called the singlino , can have a significant @xmath4-violating effect that can generate the sufficient bau , which is called singlino - driven ewbg . in this case , to avoid sizable baryon washout by the strong sphaleron , the lighter stop and/or sbottom should be lighter than about 500 gev .",
    "the reason is that the light colored particles can modify a numerical factor , @xmath11 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ r1r2 ] ) ) , so the the washout by strong sphaleron can be inefficient .",
    "however , the chosen parameter space is in tension with the stop and sbottom searches at the lhc .",
    "if the higgsino and singlino masses were degenerate , a resonance enhancement in the @xmath4-violating source term would compensate the strong sphaleron washout and thus the lhc constraints could be evaded .",
    "however , this possibility may not be realized in the type - b ewpt since @xmath8 is required .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the feasibility of the ewbg in the umssm in light of the recently discovered 126 gev higgs boson  @xcite . for the ewbg to be successful",

    "it is found that the strong first - order ewpt is driven by the doublet - singlet higgs mixing effect .",
    "since the @xmath1 boson mass is mainly controlled by the singlet vev ( times @xmath0 coupling ) , the successful condition for the strong first - order ewpt inevitably leads to the light @xmath1 boson .",
    "such a @xmath1 boson has to be leptophobic to be consistent with the collider bounds .",
    "we also estimate the bau using the closed - time - path ( ctp ) formalism . since the umssm contains an extra @xmath4-violating phase coming from an interaction between higgsino and @xmath1-ino ( superpartner of @xmath0 gauge boson ( @xmath1 ) )",
    ", we consider a scenario in which @xmath1-ino plays an essential role in generating the bau . unlike the singlino - driven ewbg scenario in the nmssm ,",

    "<S> the viable window to electroweak baryogenesis in a supersymmetric @xmath0 model is studied in light of the 126 gev higgs boson . to investigate the decoupling of the sphaleron process in the broken phase , we evaluate the sphaleron rate and order of the electroweak phase transition . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the electroweak phase transition is strongly first order due to the doublet - singlet higgs mixing . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , for typical parameter sets the @xmath1 boson has to be lighter than @xmath2-@xmath3 gev and thus leptophobic to be consistent with the collider bounds . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate the baryon asymmetry of the universe based on the closed - time - path formalism , and find that the @xmath4-violating source term fueled by the @xmath1-ino can generate sufficient baryon asymmetry . </S>"
