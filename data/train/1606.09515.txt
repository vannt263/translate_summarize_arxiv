    "dynamical systems preserving a geometrical structure have been studied quite extensively .",
    "especially those systems preserving a symplectic form have attracted a lot of attention , due to their fundamental importance in all kinds of applications .",
    "dynamical systems preserving a contact form are also of interest , both in mathematical considerations ( for example , in classifying partial differential equations ) and in specific applications ( study of euler equations ) .",
    "the 1form of liouville may be associated both with a symplectic form ( by taking the exterior derivative of it ) and with a contact form ( by adding to it a simple 1form of a new variable ) .",
    "we wish here to study dynamical systems respecting the form of liouville .",
    "as we shall see , they are symplectic systems which may be extented to contact ones .    to set up the notation , let m be a smooth ( which , in this work , means continuously differentiable the sufficient number of times ) manifold of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "a contact form on m is a 1-form @xmath1 such that @xmath2 .",
    "a strict contactomorphism is a diffeomorphism of m which preserves the contact form ( their group will be denoted as @xmath3 ) while a vector field on m is called strictly contact if its flow consists of strict contactomorphims ( we denote their algebra as @xmath4 ) . in terms of the defining contact form @xmath1 ,",
    "we have @xmath5 for a strict contactomorphism f and @xmath6 for a strictly contact vector field x , where @xmath7 denotes the lie derivative of @xmath8 in the direction of the field x. the classical example of a strictly contact vector field associated to @xmath8 is the vector field of reeb , @xmath9 , uniquely defined by the equations @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "associated to every contact vector field x is a smooth function @xmath12 , called the contact hamiltonian of x , which is given as @xmath13 .",
    "conversely , every smooth function @xmath14 gives rise to a unique contact vector field @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "usually we write @xmath18 to denote the dependence of vector field @xmath18 on its ( contact ) hamiltonian function @xmath14 .",
    "results conserning the local behavior for systems of this kind may be found in @xcite , where the authors provide explicit conditions for their linearization , in the neighborhood of a hyperbolic singularity .",
    "the study of degenerate zeros , and of their bifurcations , remains , however , far from complete .    here , in section 1",
    ", we recall the form of strictly contact vector fields of @xmath19 , and their relation with symplectic vector fields of the plane .",
    "we show that the albegra @xmath20 of plane fields preserving the form of liouville @xmath21 may be obtained by projecting on @xmath22 stictly contact fields with constant third component .",
    "we begin the classification of vector fields belonging in @xmath20 ( we shall call them liouville vector fields ) by introducing the natural equivalence relation , and by showing that the problem of their classification is equivalent to a classification of functions up to a specific equivalence relation .    in section 2 , ( germs at the orign of )",
    "univariate functions are classified up to this equivalence relation , which we name `` restricted contact equivalence '' , due to its similarity with the classical contact equivalence of functions .",
    "we provide a complete list of normal forms for function germs up to arbitrary ( finite ) codimension .    in section 3 , based on the previous results , we give local models for liouville vector fields of the plane .",
    "we first prove that all such fields are conjugate at points where they do not vanish , then we prove that they can be linearized at hyperbolic singularities , and finally we state the result conserning their finite determinacy , which is based on the finite determinacy theorem obtaind in section 2 .    in section 4",
    ", we first show how to construct a transversal unfolding of a singularity class of liouville vector fields and then we present transversal unfoldings for singularity classes of codimension 1 and 2 .",
    "phase portraits for generic bifurcations of members of @xmath20 are also given .",
    "next , in section 5 , we see that there is only one polynomial member of the group of plane diffeomorphisms preserving the form of liouville ( @xmath23 stands for this group ) .",
    "this is the linear liouville diffeomorphism , and we show the linearization of plane diffeomorphisms of this kind at hyperbolic fixed points .    in section 6 , we return to members of @xmath24 to observe that the models obtained above are members of a specific base of the vector space of homogeneous vector fields .",
    "their linearization is again shown , albeit using classical methods of normal form theory .",
    "last section contains some observations concerning future directions .    for a classical introduction to symplectic and contact topology",
    "the reader should consult @xcite , while @xcite offers a more complete study of the contact case .",
    "singularities of mappings are treated in a number of textbooks ; we recommend @xcite and @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent application of singularity theory to problems of dynamics ) .",
    "let m be a closed smooth manifold of dimension 2n+1 equipped with a contact form @xmath8 .",
    "the contact form is called regular if its reeb vector field , @xmath25 , generates a free @xmath26 action on m. in this case , m is the total space of a principal @xmath26 bundle , the so called boothby - wang bundle ( see @xcite for more details ) :    @xmath27 ,    where @xmath28 is the action of the reeb field and @xmath29 is the canonical projection on @xmath30 .",
    "b is a symplectic manifold with symplectic form @xmath31 .",
    "the projection @xmath32 induces an algebra isomorphism between functions on the base b and functions on m which are preserved under the flow of @xmath25 ( such functions are called basic ) .",
    "it also induces a surjective homomorphism between strictly contact vector fields x of @xmath33 and hamiltonian vector fields y of @xmath34 ( that is , fields y with @xmath35 ) , the kernel of which homomorphism is generated by the vector field of reeb .    in our local , three dimensional , case , things are of course simpler . using a local darboux chart ,",
    "consider the euclidean space @xmath19 equipped with the standard contact structure @xmath36 .",
    "its reeb vector fiel , @xmath37 , induces the action @xmath38 , and the quotient of @xmath19 by this action , that is , the plane @xmath22 with coordinates @xmath39 , inherits the symplectic form @xmath40 .",
    "strictly contact vector fields of @xmath19 project to hamiltonian fields on this plane ( for a direct analogy with the volume  preserving case the reader should consult @xcite ) .",
    "basic functions now depend , as one may easily verify , only on the first two variables , while the kernel of the above mentioned projection contains the multiples of @xmath41 .",
    "studying equation @xmath42 we get the general expression of @xmath43 :    @xmath44    its contact hamiltonian is of course @xmath45 ( recall that it does not depend on the third variable ) , thus :    @xmath46    observe that all vector fields of the @xmath39plane , preserving the symplectic structure @xmath47 , may be obtained in this way .    in this work we restrict our attention to those members of @xmath48 , which preserve the form of liouville @xmath21 ( we shall denote their set as @xmath49 ) .",
    "the reason for this choise will become clear in section 6 . in this case , equation @xmath50 becomes : @xmath51 while @xmath52 .",
    "thus , their general form is @xmath53 , for some univariate function @xmath54 and a constant @xmath55 .",
    "observe that all vector fields of the plane presrving the form of liouville may be obtained by projecting the members of @xmath49 on the @xmath56 plane .",

    "members of @xmath49 are trivially obtained by adding constant multiples of @xmath41 to members of @xmath20 .",
    "this lemma provides the general form of the vector fields we are interested in .",
    "our goal is the classification of these vector fields according to the natural relation defined in the obvious way : two fields @xmath60 are liouville conjugate if there exists a diffeomorphism of the plane preserving the form of liouville , @xmath61 , such that @xmath62 , while two fields @xmath63 are strictly contact conjugate if a @xmath64 exists , such that @xmath65 . observe that classifying members of @xmath20 leads to a classification of fields belonging in @xmath66 ; one needs only to extend @xmath67 to @xmath19 as @xmath68 .    to proceed with the classification of liouville vector fields of the plane",
    ", we shall exploit their dependence on real valued functions .    [ transforming ]",
    "let @xmath69 be a univariate function and @xmath70 a diffeomorphism of @xmath71 .",
    "the liouville vector field corresponding to function @xmath69 may be transformed , via a diffeomorphism respecting the form @xmath21 , to the liouville vector field corresponding to the function @xmath72 .",
    "constructing the fields corresponding to these two functions , according to the recipe given in lemma [ basiclemma ] , we conclude that the diffeomorphism accomplishing the desired transformation is @xmath73 which also preserves the liouville form .",
    "this lemma ensures that the classification of liouville vector fields , up to diffeomorphisms belonging in @xmath23 , reduces to a classification of univariate real functions . in the next section",
    ", we turn our attention to this classification .",

    "we introduce the following equivalence relation .",

    "the equivalence relation we study here requires @xmath85 .",
    "this explains why we called the above defined equivalence relation restricted contact .",
    "suppose now that @xmath86 is a curve of @xmath77equivalent germs , depending on the real parameter @xmath87 , with @xmath88 .",

    "the local models of table 2 constitute , therefore , the basis generating the fields of interest .    linear fields ( belonging to @xmath251 ) are of the form @xmath252 , with @xmath172 arbitrary constant . in our case , therefore , the existence of hyperbolic singularities is excluded ( actually , @xmath253 is also the unique linear member of @xmath254 ; strictly contact vector fields do not possess hyperbolic singularities ) . despite this fact , fields having non  zero linear part can be linearized , in a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "we shall prove it now using an approach different from the one indicated above .",
    "there are @xmath255 monomials depending on three variables , having degree @xmath240 , as simple counting arguments may assure .",
    "thereupon , the vector space @xmath256 of homogeneous vector fields of degree @xmath240 is of dimension @xmath257 , and one may easily verify that the fields appearing in table 3 , being @xmath257 independent vector fields of degree @xmath240 , constitute a basis of it .",
    "vector fields of interest here belong to this base ( to obtain them , just set @xmath258 to the first field of the second class ) .",
    "this base was presented , in the general n  dimensional case , in @xcite , section 4 of which contains the arguments we shall use to prove the next proposition .",
    "the author wishes to thank prof .",
    "j d meiss for clarifying them to him .    table 3    lll fields & condition & number +   + @xmath259     + @xmath260     + @xmath261 & @xmath262 & @xmath263 +   + @xmath264 & @xmath265&@xmath265 + @xmath266 & @xmath267 & @xmath268 +   + @xmath269 & @xmath267 & @xmath270 +    if @xmath271 , the vector field @xmath272 $ ] , where @xmath253 is the unique , linear and non  zero , strictly contact vector field presented above , is also homogeneous of degree d ( the brackets @xmath273 $ ] denote the usual commutator of vector fields ) .",
    "we may define therefore the operator @xmath274 , @xmath275 $ ] .",
    "vector fields belonging to the base of @xmath256 are eigenvectors of this operator ; thus the subspaces generated by them are invariant under @xmath276 , ensuring the diagonal form of its matrix .",
    "there exists a codimension zero subset of @xmath277 every member of which may be transformed to its linear part .",
    "the linearizing diffeomorphism is close to the identity and preserves the contact form .",
    "the subset we refer to is the set of vector fields of interest with non zero linearization , and its codimension is easily obtained .",
    "classical normal form theory ensures that , by changing coordinates , we may discard all terms of @xmath278 which are not contained in the complement of the range of this operator ( an operator which leaves invariant the spaces @xmath279 , as well as the subspaces generated by the basic vector fields , the subspace of fields which interest us included ) .",
    "the matrix of @xmath253 is self  adjoint , so a complement to the range of @xmath276 is the kernel of this operator .",
    "this kernel however , as may easily be verified , is trivial , providing us with a diffeomorphism which transforms to its ( non  zero ) linear part every field of @xmath277 .",
    "this diffeomorphism preserves the 1form defining the contact structure ; this stems from the diagonal form of the matrix of @xmath276 .",
    "strictly contact vector fields project to symplectic fields of the plane ; homogeneous strictly contact vector fields project to fields of the plane preserving the form of liouville .",
    "we have studied here the local behavior of the later ; the local study of the first remains a challenging task .",
    "contact systems have a long history , and attract a lot of attention , since they form a valuable tool in topological constructions , in hamiltonian dynamics and in many physical applications ( see @xcite for a textbook account of these fields , and further references ) .",
    "almost all contact systems possess hyperbolic singularities , as transversality arguments show . in this case , conditions for linearization have been obtained ( @xcite ) .",
    "results are much more rare , however , if the singularities are degenerate .    we chose here to consider the simpler case of homogeneous strictly contact systems .",
    "this led us to the study of plane systems , preserving the form of liouville , a subject which has an interest of its own . to study these fields we had to classify univariate functions according to the restricted contact equivalence relation .",
    "all these admit generalizations and deserve more study .    indeed , extending the definition of restricted contact equivalence to arbitrary dimensions we get of course the differential conjugacy relation for vector fields .",
    "one could probably reobtain results of normal form theory , using this approach , which would potentially help the problem of classifying vector fiels preserving the form of liouville in any dimension .    and , as already mentioned , the general problem of analyzing the behavior of contact dynamical systems stands , both interesting and difficult .",
    "the author hopes to further comment on these subjects in the future .",
    "this work is dedicated to my two professors , tassos bountis and spyros pnevmatikos , on the occasion of their 65th birthday .",
    "it is only a pleasure for the author to acknowledge the influence they had on him and to thank them for their constant support ."
