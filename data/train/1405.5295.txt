    "the use of the principle of least time ( fermat s principle ) to derive snell s law of refraction@xcite is well known and commonly presented in introductory physics textbooks . yet while it is common knowledge that light rays are refracted , less commonly known is that heat flow is also refracted .    such is unsurprising when one considers that heat is propagated by particles of matter that , like photons , exhibit a wave - particle duality . in solids , `` carriers of energy most",
    "frequently encountered are the lattice waves and the free electrons.''@xcite it is well known that electrons have a debroglie wavelength of @xmath0.@xcite heat flow in a metal chiefly takes place due to the movement of free electrons@xcite that can be viewed as a highly degenerate electron gas.@xcite so as electrons transport thermal energy across a series of metals of differing thermal conductivities , it is reasonable to expect the wave nature of those electrons to experience refraction .    the refraction of heat flow is supported in the literature .",
    "holland discusses an experiment concerning heat flow from a crucible into both solid and liquid silicon , and between each other .",
    "heat flow is observed to be refracted and an analog of snell s law is described .",
    "@xcite tan and holland disclose a tangent law ( hereinafter the tangent law ) for thermal refraction of heat flow across a boundary of materials with differing thermal conductivities .",
    "the tangent law is analogous to snell s law , but must be adjusted due to the constraint of heat flow to mathematical tubes , since the heat flow is planer : @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the thermal conductivity of conductor 1 and @xmath3 that of conductor 2 .",
    "further , bertolotti et al . shows experimental evidence for how a harmonically varying heat source produces thermal waves that are refracted when approaching the interface between two media.@xcite shendeleva discloses reflection and refraction of a plane thermal wave of oblique incidence at an interface.@xcite burt describes combinations of metal that form thermal lenses that either focus or spread heat rays.@xcite",
    "according to fourier s law of heat conduction , the heat energy flow through a conductor bridging a thermal difference is proportional to the conductor s area @xmath4 and the thermal difference bridged by temperature difference @xmath5 , and is inversely proportional to the conductor s length @xmath6.@xcite this law was formulated by joseph fourier in 1822 , @xcite and can be stated as :    @xmath7 where @xmath8 is heat energy , @xmath9 is time , @xmath10 is the conductor material s thermal conductivity .",
    "however , fourier s law only describes heat flow in a simple linear path through a single medium . describing heat flow through multiple media",
    "can be achieved by the principle of minimum thermal resistance.@xcite if the greatest proportion of heat flows through the path of least thermal resistance , then the total rate of heat flow is maximized .",
    "( feynman et al . provides a more illustrative discussion of how the principle of least time operates over multiple paths .",
    "@xcite )    a series of two media of different thermal conductivities is the simplest to model .",
    "the path of minimum thermal resistance will take a longer route through the material with greater thermal conductivity and a shorter route through the material with lesser conductivity .",
    "hence , the flow of heat is refracted .",
    "this is similar to the refraction of light in snell s law , where the proportional velocity of photons through each medium determines the light s path .",
    "when the most heat flows through the path of minimum thermal resistance , then a particular quantity of heat shall flow through the media series in the least amount of time .",
    "thus , both the refraction of light and heat flow are a consequence of the principle of least time",
    ".    a blackbody , such as a tungsten filament , will attempt to emit both heat and light in all directions .",
    "a light ray can be created by blocking the blackbody with a mask permitting light to only pass through a small hole or line .",
    "it is likewise conceivable to create a heat ray by similarly masking a source of heat so that most of the heat energy flows in nearly the same direction . in the case of conduction electrons ,",
    "the ray will travel substantially intact through several mean free paths .",
    "however , we do not need to resort to such microscopic considerations to demonstrate thermal refraction .",
    "all that is required is a heat source and sink .",
    "the somewhat nebulous flow of heat is handled by the tangent law .",
    "the authors have set up an experiment involving heat flow through two materials in series with different thermal conductivities .",
    "@xcite the materials are inexpensive bars of metal that are 5.0 cm long and 1.3 cm wide and high that are available through science education supply firms .",
    "the bars are arranged parallel lengthwise and firmly touch each other along one side of their length .",
    "heat is allowed to flow into one extreme corner of one conductor and exit through the opposite corner of the other conductor .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ thermal_refraction_01 ] . ) this is managed by placing a hot object at one corner and a cold object at the other corner .",
    "temperature sensitive indicator film is placed on top of the conductors . except for these corners ,",
    "the conductors should be completely surrounded by a good insulator , both beneath and at the sides of the conductors , otherwise valid results will likely not be obtained .",
    "styrofoam is a good insulator for this demonstration in that it is easily shaped , freely available from waste materials , and not damaged by water .",
    "the surface between the two bars should be wetted with thermally conductive paste or water , to ensure a good thermal contact ( pressure against the lengthwise dimension of the bars further improves contact ) . a small metal cup , such a paint cup for an artist s palette , filled with hot water suffices for the hot object ( take care to avoid burns ) .",
    "a second metal cup filled with ice water , or even just a small piece of ice , suffices for the cold object .",
    "temperature sensitive liquid crystal display ( lcd ) film can be used to indicate variations of temperature .",
    "2025@xmath11c range film works best .",
    "it can be cut to just cover the two metal bars , and should be coated with thermal conduction paste or water on the underside for improved thermal contact , but kept dry on the visible side to avoid cooling due to evaporation .",
    "film areas with the same color have the same temperature and hence represent isotherms .",
    "heat flows perpendicularly to isotherms , or very nearly so .",
    "the progression of isotherms indicate temperature gradients .    for this experiment , there are two chief scenarios .",
    "either the conductivities of the media are similar or dissimilar . where they are rather dissimilar , the more conductive medium acts literally as an express lane for heat flow . for media with similar conductivities ,",
    "refraction is less pronounced .",
    "conducting the demonstration to qualitatively verify whether the results are consistent with the principle of least resistance is simple .",
    "have the students note in which conductor the isotherms are the most perpendicular to the long dimension ( length ) of the conductor .",
    "if this is the material with the greatest conductivity , then the principle is confirmed , since the chief path of heat flow is taking a longer path through the more conductive medium and resistance is thus minimized .",
    "conversely , the conductor with isotherms that are most parallel to the long dimension should be the material with least conductivity .    for a quantitative experiment",
    ", students should record the angle of the most distinctive isotherm in each conductor .",
    "this may require patience and several trials , and careful attention to color variation ( taking photograph is helpful , but optional ) . pressing an ice cube against the conductor corner speeds up the demonstration , but should be sparingly applied .",
    "relaxation time may be required to overcome the effect of the boundary between conductors .",
    "good lighting is helpful , but lamps should not provide so much heat that the results are distorted .",
    "the uncertainty should also be noted .",
    "it is visually reasonable to distinguish between 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 degree angles , each which differs by 15 degrees , so a baseline uncertainty of 15 degrees is reasonable for this set - up .",
    "half of 15 degrees is possible in principle , but only if sufficiently great care is taken , which may be beyond the limits of a simple `` home - made '' classroom demonstration .",
    "further improvement may be possible with better insulation , electric heat and cold sources ( or a laser for the heat ) and digital imaging .",
    "the standard school metal bar set includes one bar each of aluminum , brass , copper and iron .",
    "the combination of copper and iron provides the greatest thermal conductivity difference and hence the most dramatic result .",
    "if two sets of bars are obtained , then control cases can be set up by pairing together the copper bars , then the iron bars , etc .",
    "no refraction should be observed in the control cases , except to the extent that the boundary effect between conductors has not been minimized .",
    "experimental results for various pairs with uncertainties are shown in table  [ experimentresults ] .",
    "the angles shown are for the path of maximum heat flow , which is simply the isotherm angle subtracted from 90@xmath11 .",
    "the first member of the pair is closest to the heat source , while the second is closest to the heat sink .",
    "results may vary due to the placement of insulation and hot and cold sources and unmitigated boundary effects .",
    ".experimental results for copper and iron [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ copper ]",
    "this colorful classroom experiment demonstrates variational principles to introductory physics students , the wave - particle duality of matter , and an important characteristic of heat flow . it is simple to set up and uses easily - obtained materials .",
    "if performed in conjunction with a classic snell s law demonstration , it also illustrates how disparate areas physics such as optics and thermodynamics are related by overarching variational principles such as the principle of least time .",
    "further exercises are possible to analyze the results . for example , an estimate of total heat flow can be made by attempting to divide the flow into several paths , and then using fourier s law to calculate relative heat flows through each path .",
    "another example is to determine how much heat flow would decrease if most ( or all ) of the heat followed an alternative path than that indicated by the principle of least resistance .",
    "further questions can also be posed .",
    "for example , how can the results be explained in terms of the discussion in feynman s lecture on the principle of least action ? in what other situations might refraction be observed ?",
    "possible extensions include using a series of more than two conductors , or conductors with differing dimensions .",
    "ruby is a good first language to learn , because it is simple to read , understand and use .",
    "it is quantitatively robust , and it contains many of features of modern , higher level languages such as object - oriented programming .",
    "computer scientist yukihiro matsumoto developed ruby and first released it in 1995 .",
    "ruby draws from perl , smalltalk , ada , and lisp .",
    "@xcite when creating ruby , matsumoto strived to develop `` a scripting language that was more powerful than perl , and more object - oriented than python ... ruby is designed to be human - oriented .",
    "it reduces the burden of programming .",
    "it tries to push jobs back to machines .",
    "you can accomplish more tasks with less work , in smaller yet readable code.''@xcite the clean , plain - english code of the ruby language makes learning its basics easy and intuitive .",
    "beginners can start with a free , 20 minute online course at the ruby lang site : < http://www.ruby-lang.org/>[<http://www.ruby-lang.org/>].@xcite      ruby on rails@xcite is an model - view - controller ( mvc ) framework created in 2013 , and allows for the rapid development of sophisticated web applications .",
    "there are tens of thousands of live ruby on rails applications .",
    "it is open source , and reputable sites offer free web hosting .",
