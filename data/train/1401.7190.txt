    "wake flows developing behind bluff - bodies have been widely studied in the past because of their revelance in various industrial fields .",
    "obviously many bluff - body geometries are encountered in industrial applications .",
    "the drilling risers used in the offshore petroleum industry are , for instance , a realistic example of one of the most frequently studied bluff body flow configuration , the infinitely long circular cylinder . in sedimentology , spheres are quite often used to model particles sedimenting in a river bed . the well known ahmed body , a three - dimensional object characterized by a rectangular - shaped cross section , is generally used as a car model in the automotive industry .",
    "these three examples are representative of two - dimensional wake flows and three - dimensional wake flows with reflectional symmetries .",
    "+ for the previously mentionned industrial applications , the wake flows are in a turbulent state .",
    "therefore , lots of studies have been dedicated to characterize the large- and small - scale fluctuations of the turbulent wakes .",
    "however recent experimental studies ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) have shown that three - dimensional turbulent wake flows additionaly exhibit bistability properties associated to the breaking of reflectional symmetries .",
    "such bistability property is more commonly observed in laminar flows developing in closed geometry ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "better understanding the laminar / turbulent transition of three - dimensional wake flows is thus still a major challenge today , which we address in this paper with linear stability theory .",
    "+ the early stages of the laminar / turbulent transition scenario are now well known for wake flows behind two - dimensional geometries ( @xcite,@xcite ) and three - dimensional axisymmetric bodies ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "however fewer studies have been dedicated to three - dimensional geometries exhibiting planar reflectional symmetries , such as the squared - back ahmed body . behind a two - dimensional circular cylinder ,",
    "the two - dimensional steady wake flow is known to first bifurcate towards a two - dimensional time - periodic state when increasing the reynolds number .",
    "this two - dimensional time - periodic flow subsequently bifurcates towards a three - dimensional time - periodic state when further increasing the reynolds number @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in this scenario",
    "the onset of unsteadinesses in the flow occurs prior to the appearance of three - dimensionality .",
    "+ for three - dimensional axisymmetric geometries such as sphere and disks , the scenario is obviously different since the steady flow is necessarily three - dimensional .",
    "the axisymmetric steady wake flow first bifurcates towards a non - axisymmetric steady state preserving a symmetry plane .",
    "subsequently a time - periodic wake flow emerges for which the planar symmetry is lost .",
    "finally a planar - symmetry time - periodic flows is observed , the symmetry plane being here normal to the one previously preserved @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the breaking of the axisymmetry occurs prior to the onset of unsteadiness in the flow .",
    "+ the fundamental difference between these two scenarios clearly lies in the nature of the first flow bifurcation . for two - dimensional geometries ,",
    "the first bifurcation is a hopf bifurcation , while for three - dimensional axisymmetric geometry the first bifurcation is a pitchfork bifurcation associated to the breaking of the rotational reflectional symmetry .",
    "recent experimental investigations @xcite have shown that the transition scenario of wakes behind a three - dimensional bluff body of short aspect - ratio @xmath5 is close to the transition scenario behind axisymmetric bodies .",
    "more specifically , the steady flow preserving the planar symmetry of the bluff body bifurcates towards an asymmetric steady state breaking the planar symmetry .",
    "the first bifurcation is therefore a pitchfork bifurcation as in the case of axisymmetric body wakes .",
    "nevertheless , observing such a permanent state requires to wait for a sufficiently long time since a planar - symmetric time - periodic flow is first observed in the experiments .",
    "the observation of such time - periodic transient state clearly suggests the existence of nearly unstable unsteady perturbations .",
    "moreover , it is legitimate to expect that , for sufficiently large values of the aspect ratio , the destabilization scenario of a two - dimensional body is recovered , i.e. the first flow bifurcation is a hopf bifurcation .",
    "+ the effect of the spanwise extent on the wake flow transition behind various three - dimensional bodies has already been addressed in the past .",
    "for instance , wakes transition behind finite - length cylinders with hemispherical ends or free ends has been investigated experimentaly in ( @xcite,@xcite ) and numerically in ( @xcite,@xcite ) with three - dimensional unsteady simulations of the navier - stokes equations . for rectangular or elliptical cross - section plates , experimental studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    "have been performed .",
    "the present paper aims at investigating the wake flow transition behind rectangular flate - plates by means of linear stability analysis .",
    "note that such geometry has been chosen because of its relevance with respect to path instabilities of three - dimensional object falling in a viscous fluid under the action of gravity @xcite .",
    "the first objective is to show that , for short aspect ratios , the flow first exhibits a pitchfork bifurcation , as for axisymmetric bodies .",
    "the second objective is to investigate how the transition scenario is modified when increasing the value of the aspect ratio .",
    "+ the original aspect of the present paper , compared to previously mentionned studies , is the systematic use of global stability analysis of fully three - dimensional flows .",
    "the first global stability analysis has been performed on two - dimensional circular cylinder wakes @xcite .",
    "an anti - symmetric unsteady global mode was found to be unstable , confirming that the first bifurcation is a hopf bifurcation .",
    "later on , global stability analysis of axisymmetric wake flows behind sphere and disks has been performed @xcite , .",
    "the steady axisymmetric flow gets first unstable to a steady mode of azimuthal wave number @xmath6 and then to an unsteady mode of same azimuthal wave number @xcite . more recently",
    ", various analyses have been proposed , based on the knowledge of unstable global modes and their adjoint global modes , in order to determine the _ wavemaker _ of the instability @xcite , to find the coefficients of the amplitude equation governing the non - linear evolution of the perturbation in the slow manifold @xcite or to design passive control strategy of unstable global modes based on sensitivity analysis @xcite,@xcite . in the case of a disk flows , the determination of two unstable global modes has been a pre - requisite to an elaborated weakly non - linear analysis @xcite that gave the complete bifurcation diagramm of the wake . up to now , only few global stability analyses have been performed on fully three - dimensional flow configuration , as for instance a jet in cross - flow ( @xcite , @xcite ) , probably because of the complexity of the underlying numerical problem . to overcome ( disregard ) this numerical complexity a strategy based on local absolute / convective stability analysis of steady flows in cross - stream planes",
    "were recently proposed and applied on the sphere wake @xcite .",
    "the stability of the fully three - dimensional wake flow developing behind the plates is here investigated by exploiting the spatial symmetries of the problem .",
    "this enables to partially reduce the computational cost of the problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the flow configuration and the global stability analysis",
    "are detailed in section [ sec : config ] .",
    "the computational methods , including the spatial discretization and the parallelization strategy , are presented in section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "the results on the largest aspect ratio plate @xmath7 are detailed in section [ sec : largeaspectratio].finally section [ sec : aspectratio ] is dedicated to the influence of the aspect ratio on the first flow bifurcation .",
    "we investigate the incompressible flow of a newtonian fluid of kinematic viscosity @xmath8 around three - dimensional plates defined by their length @xmath9 , width @xmath10 and thickness @xmath11 .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : flowconf ] a cartesian coordinate system @xmath12 is placed at the geometric center @xmath13 of the plate and the flow upstream to the plates is uniform of velocity @xmath14 .",
    "the plate width @xmath10 and the upstream velocity @xmath15 are chosen as the reference length and velocity respectively and , from now , all quantities are normalized using these reference length and velocity .",
    "three non - dimensional control parameters entirely define this flow configuration : two geometrical parameters , the thickness - to - width ratio denoted @xmath16 and the length - to - width ratio denoted @xmath17 , and one flow parameter , the reynolds number @xmath18 . in the present study",
    "the thickness - to - width ratio is fixed @xmath19 and the influence of the length - to - width ratio and reynolds number on the wake transition is studied in the parameter ranges @xmath1 and @xmath20 . since",
    "only the length - to - width ratio is varied here , it will be referred in the following as the aspect ratio .",
    "note that the aspect ratio @xmath21 corresponds to a squared plate while @xmath22 would correspond to an infinitely long plate .",
    "+        the incompressible three - dimensional flow is described by the velocity vector @xmath23 and the scalar pressure field @xmath24 which satisfy the non - dimensional unsteady navier - stokes equations @xmath25 the linear stability analysis starts by decomposing the flow variables as the sum of a steady base flow @xmath26 and an unsteady perturbation @xmath27 , which is assumed to be infinitely small in magnitude compared to the base flow . to investigate the long - term stability ,",
    "this perturbation is further decomposed into the normal mode form @xmath28 , i.e. as the sum of ( complex ) spatial structures @xmath29 whose individual temporal evolution is governed by the corresponding growth rate @xmath30 and circular frequency @xmath31 . by introducing such decomposition into the navier stokes equations ( [ eqn : ns ] )",
    "we obtain that the base flow satisfy the three - dimensional steady navier - stokes equations @xmath32 while the global modes and their corresponding growth rate and frequency are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the following equations @xmath33 assuming the eigenvalues are ordered by decreasing value of their growth rate , i.e. @xmath34 , the long - term stability of the base flow is determined by the growth rate s sign of the leading eigenvalue @xmath35 . when @xmath36 the base flow is said to be globally stable , marginally stable when @xmath37 and globally unstable when @xmath38 . if the angular frequency @xmath39 , the flow is unstable to steady perturbations , while the flow is unstable to unsteady perturbations when @xmath40 .",
    "the flat - plates exhibit two planar reflectional symmetries : one with respect to the plane @xmath41 and the other one with respect to the plane @xmath42 .",
    "for sufficiently low values of the reynolds number to be determined later , the flow is expected not only to be time - invariant but also to preserve the spatial symmetries of the body .",
    "therefore it is legitimate to assume that the base flow satisfies the reflectional symmetries with respect to the planes @xmath41 and @xmath42 , denoted in the following @xmath43 and @xmath44-symmetry respectively . due to the arbitrary orientation of the cartesian coordinate system shown in figure [ fig : flowconf ] , they will also be called top / bottom symmetry ( @xmath45-symmetry ) and left / right symmetry ( @xmath46-symmetry ) . figure",
    "[ fig : symmetry](a ) provides a graphical illustration of these flow symmetries viewed in an arbitrary cross - stream plane @xmath47 .",
    "the velocity vector @xmath48 and pressure field @xmath49 of the base flow satisfy , for any point @xmath50 , the following symmetry relations @xmath51 in other words , the @xmath45-symmetry states that the streamwise @xmath52 , cross - stream @xmath53 velocities and pressure @xmath49 are even functions with respect to the variable @xmath54 while the cross - stream velocity @xmath55 is an odd function . for the @xmath46-symmetry , @xmath52,@xmath55 and @xmath49",
    "are even functions with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath53 is an odd function .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,^ \" , ]",
    "the present results give a clear picture of the linear flow destabilization for plates of different aspect ratios . for small aspect ratio , @xmath57 ,",
    "the flow is destabilized by a steady mode breaking the top / bottom symmetry . for large aspect ratio , @xmath58 ,",
    "the flow is destabilized by an unsteady mode also breaking the top / bottom symmetry . for intermediate aspect ratio , @xmath59 ,",
    "the flow is also destabilized by an unsteady mode but breaking the left / right symmetry .",
    "+ such picture is expected to be more complex if non - linear effects as well as the existence of many unstable modes are taken into account .",
    "linear stability results should thus be compared carefully with results of experiments or direct numerical simulations . to give an insight into the complexity of the non - linear flow dynamics",
    ", the destabilization of other global modes has been tracked .",
    "two additional neutral curves of global modes have been determined .",
    "these are the black dashed and dashed - dotted lines in figure [ fig : courbesneutres ] which correspond to ( @xmath45,@xmath46)- and ( @xmath45,@xmath60)-symmetric modes respectively .",
    "+ for large aspect ratio s plates the ( @xmath45,@xmath46)-symmetric mode may play a role in the flow dynamics since this is the second mode getting unstable . the corresponding critical reynolds number ( dashed line ) increases when decreasing the aspect ratio , as for the neutral curve of the ( @xmath61,@xmath46)-symmetric mode ( solid line ) .",
    "for instance , for the aspect ratio @xmath62 three modes gets unstable in a narrow range of reynolds number .",
    "the @xmath63-symmetric mode gets first unstable around @xmath64 , then ( @xmath45,@xmath46)- and ( @xmath45,@xmath60)-symmetric modes get simultaneously unstable around @xmath65 . the coexistence of the three modes is expected to influence the non - linear flow dynamics . the number of modes getting unstable in a narrow range of values of the reynolds number increases when considering small aspect ratio s plates , as seen in the close - up view displayed in figure [ fig : courbesneutres ] .",
    "future works could be devoted to a better understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of wakes behind small aspect ratio plates , based on the knowledge of global modes getting unstable .",
