    "realized power variation of a discretely sampled process can be defined as the sum of the absolute values of the increments of the process raised to a given power .",
    "the leading case is when the power is @xmath0 , which corresponds to the realized variance that is widely used in finance .",
    "it is well known that under very weak conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) the realized variance converges to the quadratic variation of the process as the sampling frequency increases .",
    "powers other than @xmath0 have also been used as a way to measure variation of the process over a given interval in time as well as for estimation in parametric or semiparametric settings . recently ,",
    "ait - sahalia and jacod @xcite have used the realized power variation as a way to test for presence of jumps on a given path and @xcite have used it to test for common arrival of jumps in a multivariate context .",
    "the limiting behavior of the realized power variation has been studied in the continuous semimartingale case in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some of these results are extended by @xcite to situations when jumps are present but only when they have no asymptotic effect on the behavior of the realized power variation .",
    "a comprehensive study of the limiting behavior of the realized power variation when the observed process is a continuous semimartingale plus possible jumps is contained in @xcite .",
    "this work includes also cases when jumps affect the limit of the realized power variation .",
    "a common feature of the above cited papers is that the observed process always contains a continuous martingale . at the same time",
    "there are different applications , for example , for modeling internet traffic @xcite or volume of trades @xcite and asset volatility @xcite , where pure - jump semimartingales , that is , semimartingales without a continuous martingale and nontrivial quadratic variation , seem to be more appropriate .",
    "parametric models of pure - jump type for financial prices and/or volatility have been proposed in @xcite , among others .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to derive the limit behavior of the realized power variation of _ pure - jump semimartingales_.    some work has already been done in this direction .",
    "when the power exceeds the ( generalized ) blumenthar  getoor index of the jump process , it follows from @xcite and @xcite that the ( unscaled ) realized power variation converges almost surely to the sum of jumps raised to the corresponding power , which in general is not _ predictable _ ( @xcite , definition i.2.1 ) although the exact rate of this convergence is not known .    the limiting behavior of the realized power variation when the _ power is less than the blumenthal ",
    "getoor index _ is not known in general ( apart from the fact that it explodes ) . here",
    "we concentrate precisely on this case .",
    "we make an assumption of locally stable behavior of the lvy measure of the jump process .",
    "that is we assume that the lvy measure behaves like that of a stable process around zero , while its behavior for the `` big '' jumps is left unrestricted .",
    "this assumption allows us to derive the asymptotic behavior of the realized power variation in this case . unlike the case when the power exceeds the blumenthal ",
    "getoor index , here the realized power variation needs to be scaled down by a factor determined by the blumenthal ",
    "getoor index and its limit is an integral of a _",
    "predictable _ process .",
    "the latter is a direct measure for the stochastic volatility of the discretely - observed process , which is of key interest for financial applications .",
    "thus the realized power variation for powers less than the blumenthal ",
    "getoor index contains information for the value of this index as well as the underlying stochastic volatility , and hence the importance of the limit results for this range of powers that are derived here . finally , in earlier work @xcite",
    ", some limit theorems for realized power variations for pure - jump processes were studied , but the results apply in somewhat limiting situations regarding time - dependence and presence of a drift term ( i.e. , an absolutely continuous process ) , both of which are very important characteristics of financial data .",
    "a distinctive feature of this paper is that the convergence results for the realized power variation are derived on the space of functions of the power equipped with the uniform topology .",
    "in contrast , all previous work has characterized the limiting behavior for a fixed power .",
    "the uniform convergence is important when one needs to use an infinite number of powers in estimation or the power of the realized power variation needs first to be estimated itself from the data .",
    "such a case is illustrated in an application of the limit theorems derived in the paper .",
    "our application is for the estimation of the activity level of a discretely observed process .",
    "the latter is the smallest power for which the realized power variation does not explode ( formally the infimum ) . in the case of a pure - jump process",
    "the activity level is just the blumenthal ",
    "getoor index of the jumps and when a continuous martingale is present it takes its highest value of @xmath0 .",
    "apart from the importance of the blumenthal ",
    "getoor index in itself , the activity level provides information on the type of the underlying process ( e.g. , whether it contains a continuous martingale or not ) .",
    "the latter determines the appropriate scaling factor of the realized power variation in estimating integrated volatility measures .",
    "we use the realized power variation computed over two different frequencies to estimate the activity level .",
    "the choice of the power is critical as it affects both efficiency and robustness .",
    "we develop an adaptive estimation strategy using our limit results . in a first step",
    "we construct an initial consistent estimator of the activity , and then , based on the first step estimator , we choose the optimal power to estimate the activity on the second step .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "section  [ sec : limit ] derives convergence in probability and associated central limit theorems for the appropriately scaled realized power variation .",
    "section  [ sec : est ] applies the limit results of section  [ sec : limit ] to propose an efficient adaptive estimator of the activity of a discretely sampled process .",
    "section  [ sec : numer ] contains a short monte carlo study of the behavior of the estimator .",

    "the _ activity of the jumps _ in @xmath1 is measured by the so - called ( generalized ) blumenthal  getoor index .",
    "all of our limiting results for the realized power variation will depend in an essential way on it .",
    "the index is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the index was originally defined in @xcite only for pure - jump lvy processes .",
    "the definition in ( [ eq : bg ] ) extends it to an arbitrary jump semimartingale and was proposed in @xcite .",
    "we recall the following well - known facts : ( 1 )  the index takes its values in @xmath11 $ ] ; ( 2 ) it depends on the particular realization of the process on the given interval ; ( 3 ) the value of @xmath12 for the index separates finite from infinite variation jump processes .    finally , we define the main object of our study , the realized power variation .",

    "our main focus will be the behavior of @xmath15 when @xmath1 is pure - jump semimartingale and we will restrict further attention to the case when the power is below the blumenthal  getoor index and the drift term has no asymptotic effect .",
    "we start with deriving the asymptotic limit of the appropriately scaled realized power variation and then proceed with a central limit theorem associated with it . to ease exposition we first present the results in the lvy case and then generalize to the case when @xmath1 is a semimartingales with time - varying characteristics . for completeness we state corresponding results in the case when @xmath1 is a continuous martingale ( plus jumps ) as well .",
    "the convergence in probability results have been already derived in @xcite among others with various degrees of generality .",
    "we briefly summarize them here as a starting point of our analysis .",

    "if jumps are of finite variation , in part ( b ) of the theorem we restrict @xmath1 to be equal to the sum of the jumps on the interval .",
    "the reason for this is that if a drift term is present ( or equivalently a compensator for the small jumps ) , then it `` dominates '' the jumps and determines the behavior of the realized power variation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
