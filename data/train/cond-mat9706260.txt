    "interacting quantum field systems rarely allow exact , closed - form expressions for their observable quantities . in nearly every case",
    "some method of approximate solution must be employed .",
    "the most common approximation involves developing a series expansion of the quantity of interest in increasing powers of the coupling constant multiplying the interaction term in the field lagrangian .",
    "however , such a series is not expected to give a good approximation when the coupling constant in the appropriate dimensionless units is not small",
    ". even when the coupling is small , there are situations where the series approximation does not work , such as when the quantity of interest is nonanalytic at zero coupling . given the relevance of strongly interacting quantum field systems for describing processes occurring in nature",
    ", a worthwhile and stimulating challenge has been to find alternative , analytical approximation schemes which must necessarily be nonperturbative in the physical coupling constants of the field systems .",
    "the linear @xmath0-expansion ( lde ) is one such scheme which has been successfully applied to problems in , for example , @xmath2 theory@xcite and quantum chromodynamics.@xcite in outline , the lde method replaces the action @xmath3 of the field theory with a modified action @xmath4 which interpolates linearly between a soluble action @xmath5 depending on a variational parameter @xmath6 and the original @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath7 the green function of interest @xmath8 is evaluated as a power series in the artificial parameter @xmath0 up to the desired order @xmath9 and then @xmath0 is set equal to 1 . unlike the exact green function @xmath8 , the truncated green function @xmath10 will depend on @xmath6 .",
    "the latter is fixed at each order @xmath9 by applying the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms):@xcite @xmath11 the pms condition is crucial , in that it provides the nonperturbative dependence on the physical coupling parameter and in several cases has been shown to ensure convergence of the sequence of approximants @xmath12 .",
    "there is considerable arbitrariness in the choice of @xmath5 .",
    "some choices will result in more rapid convergence of the sequence or simpler calculations to perform , whereas other choices may not work at all . at the very least",
    ", @xmath5 should have some resemblance to the original action @xmath3 .",
    "proofs of the convergence of the lde method have been obtained in several different ways for certain green functions of the quantum anharmonic oscillator.@xcite these proofs have also given us insights into how the method works .",
    "for higher dimensional field theories no convergence proofs have been constructed so far and we must rely on comparison with numerical methods .",
    "in this paper we apply the lde method to a different problem : the quantum dynamics of a single electron moving in a random background potential .",
    "the idea of using the lde method comes from the so - called supersymmetric field formulation of the problem,@xcite in which quantities characterizing the quantum dynamics , such as the disorder - averaged density of states and conductance , are represented as path integrals over both commuting and anticommuting field coordinates of some interacting field system . for a random potential which is gaussian delta - function",
    "correlated the corresponding supersymmetric field actions resemble the usual @xmath2 action , hence suggesting the possibility of applying the lde method to the former systems as well .",
    "of course , there are already several well - established approximation methods for studying the quantum dynamics of an electron in a random potential .",
    "nevertheless , we thought it would be interesting to see whether a method originally developed for the study of relativistic quantum field systems could be successfully adapted to random electron systems .",
    "first indications are that the lde method in fact performs rather well in comparison with established approximation methods .",
    "the supersymmetric field actions have several unusual features which have not been considered before in lde investigations .",
    "the kinetic term for the anticommuting fields is of faddeev - popov ( fp ) rather than the usual dirac form ( i.e. , @xmath13 instead of @xmath14 ) .",
    "also , the interaction terms appearing in the actions are imaginary and , for the action associated with the disorder - averaged conductance , we have a minkowskian field metric [ i.e. , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 ; @xmath17 . in the following sections we show how the lde method generalizes to such systems .    in sec .",
    "ii we evaluate to third order in @xmath0 the ground state energy of a supersymmetric anharmonic oscillator with fp kinetic term and real , positive anharmonic coupling parameter .",
    "the action for this system is in fact the same as that associated with the one - dimensional density of states for delta - function - correlated disorder , the only difference being that the coupling is real instead of imaginary .",
    "although the ground state energy is of little relevance for the random electron dynamics , it is the simplest quantity on which to test the lde method .",
    "furthermore , the calculation gives some understanding of the method s origins by showing that to first order in @xmath0 it is equivalent to choosing a gaussian wavefunction with variational parameters which are fixed by requiring that the energy expectation value be a minimum .",
    "as we shall see , the lde method reveals a rather remarkable dependence of the ground state energy on the frequency and anharmonic coupling parameters , making the supersymmetric anharmonic oscillator an interesting system in its own right .",
    "the lde method is applied to the disorder - averaged energy density of states in sec .",
    "we first consider a  zero - dimensional \" density of states model ( i.e. , path integral replaced by ordinary integral ) , for which we can easily go to high order in @xmath0 and obtain support for the convergence of the expansion .",
    "we then evaluate to second order in @xmath0 the one - dimensional density of states for delta - function - correlated disorder and compare with the exact expression , as well as with the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) . while the use of the lde was motivated by the supersymmetric field formulation , it is in fact not necessary to calculate the density of states within this formulation .",
    "indeed , we show that the same series approximation is obtained by expanding in @xmath0 the averaged one - electron green function expressed directly in terms of a @xmath0-modified single - electron hamiltonian .",
    "note that the lde method is not restricted to low dimensions , nor to just delta - function - correlated random potentials .",
    "because the supersymmetric action associated with the disorder - averaged conductance has minkowskian field coordinate metric , the action must be @xmath0-modified in a way which is quite different from that of the density of states action . in sec .",
    "iv , we describe one possible @xmath0-modification .",
    "in contrast with the density of states , the supersymmetric field formulation is essential for the application of the lde method to the conductance : there is no modified physical hamiltonian which yields the same series expansion in @xmath0 . as a first test ,",
    "we apply the method to a zero - dimensional conductance model .    in the conclusion",
    "we suggest further directions for research .",
    "this includes the application of the lde method to the supersymmetric non - linear sigma model in order to determine the conductivity critical exponent .",
    "in this section we use the lde method to determine the ground state energy of a quantum , supersymmetric anharmonic oscillator .",
    "the classical lagrangian is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a supervector coordinate with anticommuting component @xmath20 and commuting component @xmath21 . in all our calculations involving anticommuting variables we follow the rules and conventions of efetov,@xcite the only difference occurring in the definition of complex conjugation for anticommuting variables .",

    "the above method provides only a one - off approximation , however .",
    "a considerable improvement would be a scheme in which the expectation value @xmath70 , for @xmath71 given by eq.([susytrialfunction ] ) , appears as the first - order term in a perturbation series . as shown by stevenson for the ordinary anharmonic oscillator ( see sect .",

    "we are therefore led to consider the following @xmath0-modification : @xmath158 where @xmath4 is given by eq .",
    "( [ deltazerodaction ] ) and @xmath159\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\theta(s_1^ * s_1 -s_2^ * s_2 ) + ( \\chi_1^ * \\chi_1 -\\chi_2^ * \\chi_2)\\   \\delta(s_1^ * s_1 -s_2^ * s_2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\chi_1^ * \\chi_1 \\chi_2^ * \\chi_2\\ \\delta'(s_1^ * s_1 -s_2^ * s_2 ) .",
    "\\label{superstep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath160 limits the integration range to @xmath155 , while preserving supersymmetry .",
    "we call this the supersymmetric step function . using the identity @xmath161",
    ", we can check that @xmath162 .",
    "expanding eq .",
    "( [ deltazerodcond ] ) with respect to @xmath0 and then carrying out the integrals , we obtain an expression which coincides with twice the real part of expression ( [ deltaexpand ] ) multiplied by the factor @xmath148 and with the parameter @xmath121 replaced by @xmath149 .",
    "thus , we can immediately conclude that applying the pms condition and then taking the real part yields a series which converges to the exact solution ( [ zerodcondsolution ] ) .    having found a way in which to apply the lde method to the zero - dimensional conductance model",
    ", we can now try to apply the method in the same way to the @xmath138 and @xmath139 terms in eq .",
    "( [ conductance ] ) . the @xmath0-modified actions @xmath163 and @xmath164 analogous to eq .",
    "( [ deltazerodaction ] ) are clear . as for the supersymmetric step function , the natural choice is @xmath165 the delta - modifications of the terms involving @xmath138 and @xmath139 in eq .",
    "( [ conductance ] ) are then just the analogues of eq .",
    "( [ deltazerodcond ] ) .",
    "we are faced with some difficulty , however , in evaluating the terms in the @xmath0-expansion series .",
    "the difficulty lies in performing the path integrals in the presence of the step function ( [ dsuperstep ] ) .",
    "the first thought is to carry out the path integrals first and then the @xmath166-integral appearing in the definition of the step function . but interchanging the order of integration in this way makes the path integrals ill - defined for the same reason as was mentioned above for the ordinary integrals of the zero - dimensional model .",
    "one possible resolution is to have a series expansion of the step function involving only polynomial and gaussian functions of the superfields  so that the path integrals can be performed  and to link the order of this expansion with the order of the @xmath0-expansion .",
    "relevant discussions can be found in ref .   .",
    "we have applied the lde approximation method to the quantum dynamics of a single electron in a random potential .",
    "the lde method was originally developed for the study of quantum field systems such as @xmath2 field theory .",
    "the idea that the lde method might be applied to disordered systems as well comes from the resemblance of the path integral expressions of the @xmath2 field theory @xmath1-point functions to the supersymmetric path integral expressions of quantities such as the averaged density of states and conductance for gaussian delta - function - correlated disorder .",
    "the supersymmetric actions associated with these quantities contain several unusual features , such as faddeev - popov rather than dirac kinetic term for the anticommuting fields , imaginary coupling , and minkowskian field coordinate metric .",
    "we showed how the lde method can be applied to such systems using as illustrative examples the ground state energy of a supersymmetric anharmonic oscillator , a zero - dimensional density of states model , the one - dimensional density of states , and a zero - dimensional conductance model .",
    "the next stage is to apply the lde approximation to the density of states in @xmath126 for gaussian delta - function as well as other types of correlated disorder .",
    "the calculations should be similar to those for the @xmath109 density of states , the only essential new feature being the need to regularize and renormalize .",
    "the ideas presented concerning the application of the lde method to the conductance must also be developed further .",
    "we now finish with a brief description of another possible application of the lde method .",
    "this concerns the use of a supersymmetric non - linear @xmath167-model to determine the conductivity critical exponent for the anderson metal - insulator transition ( see , e.g. , sects . 3 and 4 of ref .   and also ref .",
    "for a review of the anderson transition ) .",
    "the @xmath167-model is usually quantized using the @xmath168 expansion.@xcite however , the conductivity exponent for @xmath169 @xmath170 was found not to agree with the accepted value from numerical calculations.@xcite one possible reason put forward for this disagreement is the omission from the @xmath167-model action of high - order gradient terms which may be relevant to the fixed point and @xmath171-expansion ( see , e.g. , ref .   for a review ) .",
    "another possibility is that the @xmath167-model is adequate , but the method of perturbative quantization is not .",
    "with respect to the latter possibility , it would be of interest to try to apply the lde or some related method to the supersymmetric non - linear @xmath167-model in order to determine the conductivity exponent",
