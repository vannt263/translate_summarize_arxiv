    "the central problem for hard diffractive scattering processes , characterized by a large rapidity gap in high - energy collisions , is whether they can be factorized into non - perturbative diffractive parton density functions ( pdfs ) of a colorless object ( e.g.  a pomeron ) and perturbatively calculable partonic cross sections .",
    "this concept is believed to hold for the scattering of point - like electromagnetic probes off a hadronic target , such as deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) or direct photoproduction @xcite , but has been shown to fail for purely hadronic collisions @xcite .",
    "factorization is thus expected to fail also in resolved photoproduction , where the photon first dissolves into partonic constituents , before these scatter off the hadronic target .",
    "the separation of the two types of photoproduction processes is , however , a leading order ( lo ) concept . at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of perturbative qcd ,",
    "they are closely connected by an initial - state ( is ) singularity originating from the splitting @xmath1 ( for a review see @xcite ) , which may play a role in the way factorization breaks down in diffractive photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the breaking of the resolved photoproduction component only leads to a dependence of the predicted cross section on the factorization scale @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "since this @xmath2-dependence is unphysical , it must be remedied also for the factorization breaking of the resolved part of the cross section , e.g.  by modifying the is singular direct part . a proposal how to achieve this",
    "has been worked out in @xcite and has been reviewed already in the proceedings of the workshop on _ hera and the lhc _ of 2004 - 2005 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . since from a theoretical point of view only the suppression of the resolved or in addition the is singular direct component @xcite is viable , it is an interesting question whether the diffractive dijet photoproduction data show breaking of the factorization , how large the suppression in comparison to no breaking will be , and whether the breaking occurs in all components or just in the resolved plus direct is component .",
    "the value of the suppression factor or survival probability can then be compared to theoretical predictions @xcite and to the survival probability observed in jet production in @xmath3 collisions at the tevatron @xcite and will be of interest for similar diffractive processes at the lhc .    since 2005 no further developments occurred on the theoretical side . on the experimental side ,",
    "however , the final diffractive pdfs ( dpdfs ) , which have been determined from the inclusive measurements of the diffractive structure function @xmath4 by the h1 collaboration , have been published @xcite .",
    "also both collaborations at hera , h1 and zeus , have now published their final experimental data of the cross sections for diffractive dijet photoproduction @xcite .",
    "whereas h1 confirm in @xcite their earlier findings based on the analysis of preliminary data and preliminary dpdfs , the authors of the zeus analysis @xcite reached somewhat different conclusions from their analysis .",
    "specifically , the h1 collaboration @xcite obtained a global suppression of their measured cross sections as compared to the nlo calculations . in this comparison @xcite , the survival probability is r = 0.5 , independent of the dpdfs fit used , i.e.  fit a or b in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition they concluded that the assumption that the direct cross section obeys factorization is strongly disfavored by their analysis .",
    "the zeus collaboration , on the other hand , concluded from their analysis @xcite , that , within the large uncertainties of the nlo calculations , their data are compatible with the qcd calculations , i.e.  that no suppression would be present .    due to these somewhat inconsistent results we made a new effort @xcite to analyze the h1 @xcite and the zeus @xcite data , following more or less the same strategy as in our earlier work @xcite on the basis of the nlo program of @xcite and the new dpdfs sets of ref .",
    "the h1 and the zeus dijet data can not be compared directly , since they have different kinematic cuts . in particular , in the h1 measurements @xcite @xmath5 ( 4 ) gev and @xmath6 , and in the zeus measurements @xcite @xmath7 ( 6.5 ) gev and @xmath8 ( these and all other variables used in this review are defined in @xcite and in the corresponding experimental contribution in these proceedings ) .",
    "it is clear that in order to establish a global suppression , i.e.  an equal suppression of the direct and the resolved cross section , the absolute normalization and not so much the shape of the measured cross section is very important .",
    "this normalization depends on the applied kinematic cuts .",
    "of course , the same cuts must be applied to the nlo cross section calculation . in case of a resolved suppression only , the suppression depends on the normalization of the cross sections , but also on the shape of some ( in particular the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) distributions , and will automatically be smaller at large @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "distributions in @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) are not sensitive to the suppression mechanism .",
    "the distribution in @xmath16 , on the other hand , is sensitive to the functional behavior of the dpdfs , in particular of the gluon at large fractional momenta .",
    "in the meantime , the h1 collaboration made an effort to put more light into the somewhat contradictory conclusions of the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations by performing a new analysis of their data , now with increased luminosity , with the same kinematic cuts as in @xcite , i.e.  the low-@xmath10 cut , and the high-@xmath10 cut as in the zeus analysis @xcite .",
    "the results have been presented at dis 2008 @xcite and will be published soon .",
    "we have performed a new study of these h1 @xcite and zeus data @xcite to show more clearly the differences between the three data sets @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we shall show a selection of these comparisons .",
    "the emphasis in these comparisons will be , how large the survival probability of the diffractive dijet cross section will be globally and whether the model with resolved suppression only will also describe the data in a satisfactory way . in section 2",
    "we show the comparison with the h1 data @xcite and in section 3 with the zeus data @xcite .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "the recent h1 data for diffractive photoproduction of dijets @xcite have several advantages as compared to the earlier h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite analyses .",
    "first , the integrated luminosity is three times higher than in the previous h1 analysis @xcite comparable to the luminosity in the zeus analysis @xcite .",
    "second , h1 took data with low-@xmath0 and high-@xmath0 cuts , which allows for a comparison of @xcite with @xcite .",
    "the exact two kinematic ranges are given in @xcite .",
    "the ranges for the low-@xmath0 cuts are as in the previous h1 analysis @xcite and for the high-@xmath0 cuts are chosen as in the zeus analysis with two exceptions . in the zeus analysis",
    "the maximal cut on @xmath17 is larger and the data are taken in an extended @xmath14-range .",
    "the definition of the various variables can be found in the h1 and zeus publications @xcite .",
    "very important is the cut on @xmath13 .",
    "it is kept small in both analyses in order for the pomeron exchange to be dominant . in the experimental analysis as well as in the nlo calculations ,",
    "jets are defined with the inclusive @xmath18-cluster algorithm @xcite in the laboratory frame .",
    "at least two jets are required with the respective cuts on @xmath10 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 refers to the jet with the largest ( second largest ) @xmath0 . before we confront the calculated cross sections with the experimental data , we correct them for hadronization effects .",
    "the hadronization corrections are calculated by means of the lo rapgap monte carlo generator .",
    "the factors for the transformation of jets made up of stable hadrons to parton jets were supplied by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "our calculations are done with the ` h1 2006 fit b ' @xcite dpdfs , since they give smaller diffractive dijet cross sections than with the ` h1 2006 fit a ' .",
    "we then take @xmath21 with @xmath22 gev , which corresponds to the value used in the dpdfs ` h1 2006 fit a , b ' @xcite . for the photon pdfs we have chosen the nlo grv parameterization transformed to the @xmath23 scheme @xcite .",
