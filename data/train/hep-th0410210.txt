    "we further note that the universal infinite factor @xmath21 and the factor @xmath9 drop out from normalized correlators of operators inserted in the bulk and/or on the @xmath3 boundary .",
    "equivalently one can assume that the boundary conditions on a half - cylinder at infinity correspond to the bulk cft conformal vacuum .",
    "the bulk stress energy tensor then decreases at infinity as @xmath22 the logarithm of the partition function with this boundary condition has the form @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the boundary entropy is defined as @xmath25 since temperature is the only dimensionful parameter @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the renormalization energy scale . at a fixed point @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the universal noninteger gound state degeneracy of affleck and ludwig @xcite .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite and shown in conformal perturbation theory in @xcite that @xmath30 decreases from fixed point to fixed point under rg flow . in @xcite a nonperturbative proof of this statement which is also known as `` g - theorem '' was given .",

    "hence a factor of @xmath27 appears with each integration . the gradient formula ( [ grad_f ] ) , ( [ metric ] ) was to a large extent inspired by works on boundary string field theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider two exactly solvable models : a free boson with a boundary mass term and the ising model at criticality with a boundary magnetic field .",

    "it describes a flow from neumann to dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "the boundary entropy for this model was computed in @xcite and its monotonic decrease was demonstrated . because of the zero mode the boundary entropy is infinite at the uv fixed point . from this point of view",
    "this is not a completely clean example of a boundary flow .",
    "we consider it in section 3 as a warm up example , demonstrate the gradient formula and show that the way it works is in accordance with the general proof .",
    "our main example is the ising model with a boundary magnetic field .",

    "we show that the boundary entropy monotonically decreases along the flow between the fixed points values .",
    "mathematically both models being gaussian are close relatives that is revealed by similar looking answers .",
    "however the ising model besides being a more physical example also provides a better illustration of various contact terms appearing throughout the proof .",
    "these contact terms are reviewed along with the proof of the gradient formula in the next section .",
    "for the ising model we check that the gradient formula works and demonstrate by explicit computations that it does it according to the general proof .",
    "to finish the overview of the paper let us mention that appendix a provides a discussion of a certain type of distributions supported at a point on the boundary as well as explicit computations of the ones that appear in the models considered .",

    "this boundary vector field can be extended to a conformal killing vector field on the whole half - cylinder .",

    "its explicit form can be most easily found in complex coordinates @xmath64 .",

    "the particular vector field we chose is the best approximation of local dilatation in the sense that @xmath68 that is crucial for the proof . for all other aforementioned vector fields",
    "this is just @xmath69 . ] .",
    "integrating by parts in the balk we obtain by ( [ conserv1 ] ) @xmath70 there is no boundary term from infinity because of the boundary condition ( [ bc_infty ] ) .",
    "since @xmath71 is a conformal killing vector we have @xmath72 now note that the operator @xmath73 can have only a contact term ope with any other operator .",
    "( we are going to discuss these contact terms in more details after we finish reviewing the proof . ) since @xmath73 has canonical dimension 2 and in a renormalizable qft @xmath45 has dimension less or equal than 1 the most singular contact terms possible are of the form @xmath74 and @xmath75 . noting that the difference @xmath76 vanishes to the second order at @xmath3 , @xmath63 we see that contact terms make no contribution .",
    "therefore @xmath77 plugging this back into ( [ lhs ] ) we obtain @xmath78\\phi_{a}(\\tau_{1})\\rangle_{c}\\ ] ] that by rg equation ( [ 1pt_rg ] ) can be written as @xmath79 that completes the proof of the gradient formula .    in the course of proof we encountered contact terms of two kinds .",
    "the first kind has to do with nonintegrable singularities in the two point functions @xmath80 .",
    "contact terms that renormalize these nonintegrable singularities and promote the two - point functions to distributions come about when in the course of proof of the gradient formula we split expression ( [ lhs ] ) into 2 terms ( [ term1 ] ) , ( [ term2 ] ) .",
    "a textbook example of treatment of such contact terms by standard renormalization technique arises when one considers a correlator of composite fields in free field theory @xmath81 here @xmath82 stands for the field momentum space modes .",
    "the corresponding momentum space feynman diagram is     [ fig:1 ]    it has a divergence that is essentially of the same kind as a one - loop divergence in an interacting theory .",
    "the usual momentum space counterterms when translated into position space correspond to a linear combination of derivatives of a delta function with divergent coefficients .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite section 6.2.2 for a sample computation . )",
    "alternatively instead of working in momentum space one can employ a point splitting regularization + minimal subtraction to compute these contact terms . in the free massless boson with a boundary mass model the two point functions are integrable and",
    "there is no need for contact terms of this kind . in the ising model with a boundary magnetic field",
    "the two point function has a nonintegrable singularity @xmath83 . using the point splitting plus minimal subtraction scheme the distributional two - point function @xmath80",
    "is computed in section 4 ( see formulas ( [ r ] ) , ( [ g2 ] ) ) .",
    "note that although such contact terms are scheme dependent the sum of terms ( [ term1 ] ) , ( [ term2 ] ) is independent of the choice of contact terms .",
    "a contact term of a different kind is a contact term in the ope between @xmath84 and a boundary operator @xmath85 . in a bulk theory",
    "analogous contact terms stem from the fact that @xmath86 is a generator of dilatations .",
    "for instance if @xmath87 is a cft primary of weights @xmath88 we have a contact term @xmath89 one can derive this contact term starting with standard ope of @xmath87 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 and using the ward identity @xmath92(z,\\bar z)\\phi(z',\\bar z ' ) = -\\delta^{(2)}(z - z')\\partial \\phi(z',\\bar z')\\ ] ] and the complex conjugated one .",
    "namely if we differentiate the ope of @xmath90 and @xmath93 with respect to @xmath94 and make use of the identity @xmath95 we obtain @xmath96 plugging this into the above ward identity we deduce that @xmath97 a complex conjugated identity is obtained in an analogous way . since @xmath98",
    "we obtain ( [ bulk_cc ] ) .    in the presence of a boundary",
    "the generator of dilatations becomes @xmath99 .",
    "the ward identity corresponding to translations preserving the boundary reads @xmath100\\phi(\\tau ' ) + \\delta(x)[i(t_{zz}-t_{\\bar z\\bar z } ) + \\partial_{\\tau}\\theta]\\phi(\\theta ' ) = \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\delta(x)\\delta(\\tau-\\tau')\\partial_{\\tau'}\\phi(\\tau ' ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that there is a freedom in how the contact term on the right hand can be split between the bulk and boundary .",
    "] terms on the left hand side . in other words",
    "the contact terms between @xmath101 and bulk and boundary counterparts of the stress tensor are scheme dependent . given a particular renormalization scheme we can again take ope s of @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath85 and differentiate them with respect to @xmath8 and @xmath102 respectively using identities similar to ( [ delta_f ] ) . since for any @xmath103 the ope s with @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) are holomorphic ( antiholomorphic ) in @xmath8 ( @xmath102 ) a derivative with respect to @xmath102 ( @xmath8 ) taken in a distributional sense should yield distributions supported at a boundary point @xmath104 . a more detailed discussion of how to obtain formulas similar to ( [ delta_f ] ) in the presence of boundary is given in appendix a. once we have a contact term of @xmath101 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 we can use them in ( [ wardid ] ) to obtain a contact term of @xmath73 with @xmath101 .",
    "we follow this sketch of a computation for the two models we consider in the subsequent sections .",
    "those computations are done in a particular renormalization scheme and we would like to emphasize again the scheme dependence of contact terms . thus one could make use of a scheme in which there are no contact terms in the @xmath73 ope with @xmath101 at all with all proper contact terms appearing in the ope between @xmath44 and @xmath101 .    note that contact terms of both kinds are not independent .",
    "they appear together in the rg equation for a one - point function of @xmath101 @xmath107 when the subtraction scheme is chosen one can compute the left hand side .",
    "if the scheme for computing the contact terms of both kinds in the correlators is chosen consistently then upon integration ( [ dil ] ) should hold .",
    "another appearance of both contact terms happens in the identity @xmath108\\ ] ] that was derived in the course of proving the gradient formula .",

    "we further assume that @xmath238 diverges at that point slower than @xmath241 .",
    "in particular we will be interested in defining @xmath242 and @xmath243 it is intuitively clear that any distribution expressed as @xmath244 where @xmath245 satisfies the above conditions should be supported at the singularity point @xmath246 . by dimensional reasons",

    "the first term on the right hand side is well defined as the singularity of @xmath245 is integrable in two - dimensions .",
    "the second term in the above equation vanishes because the test function is fast decreasing at infinity . in the last term one has to regularize a singular function of one variable @xmath250 and promote it to a one - dimensional distribution .",
    "thus we see that the problem of defining a distribution @xmath244 on a space with boundary ( a half - cylinder in our case ) boils down to defining a one - dimensional distribution to be denoted @xmath251 that regularizes the restriction of @xmath245 to the boundary .",
    "this can be done in a standard fashion , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "as we stick to point splitting regularization throughout the paper we will define a distribution @xmath251 by the formula @xmath252\\ ] ] where @xmath253 is a counterterm ensuring the convergence of the whole expression . in the case when no counterterm is needed and it can thus be set to zero the right hand side gives the principal value of the corresponding integral . when @xmath253 is present it is defined up to an essential ambiguity @xmath254 .",

    "however it is convenient to use a different representation of the constant @xmath258 . by applying cauchy formula to the function @xmath245 in region @xmath259 we have @xmath260 using this formula we deduce from ( [ maindef ] ) and ( [ f1d ] ) that @xmath261 let us apply now this formula to functions ( [ func1 ] ) , ( [ func2 ] ) .",
    "the restriction of function @xmath245 in ( [ func1 ] ) to the boundary reads @xmath262 it is clear from this expression that the principal value integral of @xmath263 exists .",

    "the remaining finite piece can be computed using the following trick .",
