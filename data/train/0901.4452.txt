    "various experiments have demonstrated the possibility to reproduce properties seen in the anderson model including effects of magnetic fields @xcite .",

    "<S> we numerically show that very small magnetic flux can significantly shift the metal - insulator transition point in a disordered electronic system . </S>",
    "<S> the shift we observe for the 3d anderson model obeys a power law as predicted by larkin and khmelnitskii ( 1981 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the exponent and find good agreement with the prediction . </S>",
    "<S> however , the power law holds only for much smaller magnetic fields than has been previously assumed , and is accompanied by a large prefactor , leading to a surprising strong dependence of the transition point on the applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the critical level - spacing distribution is identical in the presence and absence of a magnetic field if hard - wall boundary conditions are applied . </S>",
    "<S> this result is surprising since both cases belong to different universality classes and different distributions have been reported for periodic boundary conditions . </S>"
