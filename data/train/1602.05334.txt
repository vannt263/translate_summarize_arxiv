    "sn 2013dy , an sn ia , was discovered at roughly a magnitude of @xmath117.2 mag on ut july 10.45 2013 ( universal time is used throughout this paper ) in an unfiltered image of the galaxy ngc 7250 by the lick observatory supernova search @xcite .",
    "its coordinates are r.a.@xmath14.60 , dec=@xmath15349.54(j2000 ) and it is located at 2.3  west and 26.4  north of the center of the host galaxy ( see figure [ < img > ] ) .",
    "it was well studied by zheng et al .",
    "( 2013 , hereafter z13 ) at early phase , based on the dense photometries ( @xmath16 @xmath17 to @xmath18 days ; the variable @xmath19 denotes the time since @xmath4 band maximum and is used throughout this paper ) and spectra ( @xmath16 @xmath20 to @xmath21 days ) .",
    "pan et al .",
    "( 2015 , hereafter p15 ) also investigated this sn from the @xmath22 band photometry and uv  optical spectroscopy data set spanning from @xmath1 0.1 to @xmath1500 days after explosion .    based on the discovery and pre - discovery images",
    ", z13 constrained the first - light time ( i.e. , jd 2456483.18 ) of sn 2013dy to be only 2.4@xmath101.2 hr before the first detection .",
    "this makes it the earliest known detection of an sn ia .",
    "they inferred an upper limit on the radius of the progenitor star of @xmath230.25@xmath24 through the early - time observations , which is consistent with that of a white dwarf progenitor .",
    "the early rising light curve exhibits a broken power law with exponents of 0.88 and then 1.80 , which suggests that the rising exponent of sne ia may vary with time .",
    "besides , z13 derived that sn 2013dy reached a @xmath4 band maximum at @xmath117.7 days after first light with @xmath25=13.28@xmath100.01 mag .",
    "a spectrum taken at @xmath26 days reveals a c  ii@xmath276580 absorption line comparable in strength to siii@xmath276355 .",
    "such a strong c  iilines are not usually seen in normal sne ia , but similar features have been observed in a few superluminous sne ia ( i.e. , sn 2009dc ; @xcite ) .",
    "this feature suggests that the progenitor star had significant unburned material .    in this paper",
    ", we present extensive and independent uv - optical photometry and optical spectroscopy of sn 2013dy .",
    "additionally , the @xmath28 photometry of z13 and the @xmath29 photometry of p15 are also involved in the analysis .",
    "note that , the uv and @xmath30 band photometry in this paper are unique and important for the further investigation since these data are not involved in z13 and p15 . on the other hand , our dense @xmath28 photometry and low - resolution spectra can fill the observational gaps in z13 and p15 in the first 200 days after explosion , which makes sn 2013dy to be a super well - sampled sn ia .",
    "that could provide highly constraining information in investigating the properties of sne ia .",
    "furthermore , the large data set presented in this paper can help us further understand the diversity of sne ia and their impact on cosmological applications .",

    "ngc 7250 , the host galaxy of sn 2013dy , is an irregular galaxy characterized by the  dual cores \" in the center , see the top right panel of figure [ < img > ] . these two cores at a distance of @xmath33 or @xmath34 pc refer to the distance of ngc 7250 derived in this paper ( i.e. , @xmath35=20.0@xmath104.0 mpc ) .",
    "the dual - core feature might be interpreted by the interaction of two galaxies in the past .",
    "z13 also noted that there is a bright , blue region at @xmath1 @xmath36 west and @xmath37 south of this sn ( projected distance @xmath35 = @xmath11.2 kpc ) , which might relate to the merging history .",

    "note that the uv flux at @xmath124 days is estimated through the stretched uv light curves of sn 2011fe , which might induce some errors because of the difference presented in figure [ < uvop > ] .",
    "the fluxes beyond the @xmath58 band ( i.e. , 18,000 to 24,000 ) are extrapolated through blackbody approximation .",
    "the missing fluxes at wavelengths shorter than the @xmath42 uv filters ( e.g. , @xmath125 1600  ) or longer than 24,000    are negligible .",
    "the  uvoir \" bolometric light curve of sn 2011fe @xcite is also overplotted in this figure .",
    "an obvious shoulder at around @xmath126 days of sn 2013dy implies a higher intrinsic luminosity than sn 2011fe .",
    "the fraction of the uv ( 1600 - 3300 ) and nir ( 9000 - 24,000 ) to the optical flux of sn 2013dy and sn 2011fe is presented in the top right panel of figure [ < bolo > ] .",
    "based on this panel , we can find out that the uv flux of sn 2013dy is relatively higher than that of sn 2011fe at the early phase while the nir flux of the former is relatively lower .",
    "it also indicates that sn 2013dy has relatively stronger optical flux at @xmath127 days . \"",
    "based on the @xmath128 light curve , we estimate that sn 2013dy reaches its bolometric maximum ( @xmath129 = [ 1.95 @xmath10 0.55]@xmath130 10@xmath131 erg s@xmath7 ) at about 0.9 days before the @xmath4 band maximum .",
    "this could also be found in some bight sne ia ( e.g. , 91t/99aa - like events ) and relates to the strong contribution at wavelengths shorter than the @xmath4 band .",
    "the uncertainty of the peak flux includes the errors in the distance modulus , the observed magnitudes , the nir corrections , and the missing of flux .",
    "z13 found that the first - light time of sn 2013dy is jd 2456483.18 , thus the rise time of the bolometric light curve ( i.e. , @xmath132 17.3 days ) is adopted in the following estimation . with the derived bolometric luminosity and the rise time of the bolometric light curve ,",
    "the synthesized @xmath8ni mass estimated using the arnett law @xcite is @xmath133 .",
    "this value is similar to that of sn 2012fr ( 0.88 m@xmath11 , @xcite ) and larger than that of sn 1999aa ( 0.72 m@xmath11 , this paper ) , sn 2003du ( i.e. , 0.63@xmath100.19 m@xmath11 , this paper ; 0.68 m@xmath11 , @xcite ; 0.60 m@xmath11 , @xcite ) and sn 2011fe ( e.g. , 0.53 m@xmath11 , @xcite ; 0.56 m@xmath11 , @xcite ) .    on the other hand , we could estimate some explosion parameters of this sn by adopting the same method as in @xcite .",
    "the ejecta mass ( @xmath134 ) and the total explosion energy ( @xmath135 ) can be derived from the diffuse time @xmath136 and ejecta velocity @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the diffuse time of sn 2013dy is 27.58 days , which is longer than that of sn 2011fe ( i.e. , 25.33 days ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity of siii@xmath276355 of sn 2013dy at around maximum is 10,450 km / s which is also slightly faster than that of sn 2011fe ( i.e. , 10,340 km / s ) . as a result",
    ", we find that @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "note that these coefficients conform to the stretch factors adopted in figure [ < lc > ] for the light curve comparison .",
    "the mass of @xmath8ni produced in sn 2013dy is 0.67 m@xmath11 based on the estimation of sn 2011fe ( e.g. , 0.56m@xmath11 , @xcite ) and the similar component assumption in arnett s ( 1982 ) law .",
    "this result is independent of distance and extinction .",
    "it is smaller than the estimation of the bolometric curve . a smaller estimation for the @xmath8ni  mass of sn 2013dy might suggest a distinct energy and material distribution between sn 2013dy and sn 2011fe since only the opaque mass can be calculated from these simple analytic approaches .",
    "spectroscopy classification schemes have recently been proposed to highlight the diversity of relatively normal sne ia .",
    "@xcite classified the normal sne ia into lvg and hvg groups by the temporal velocity gradient of the siii@xmath276355 line . based on the ew of the absorption features of siii@xmath275972 and siii@xmath276355 , @xcite suggested dividing the sn ia sample into four groups : cool ( cl ) , shallow silicon ( ss ) , core normal ( cn ) , and broad line ( bl ) .",
    "the cl group mainly consists of the faint objects like sn 1991bg @xcite . besides of the faint peculiar events like sn 2002cx @xcite , the ss group is mainly consisted by the bright 91t/99aa - like events , the superluminous events ( e.g. , sn 2003fg , @xcite ; sn 2007if , @xcite and sn 2009dc , @xcite ) and also the narrow - lined sne ia ( nl ; e.g. , sn 2012fr ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the small ew of siii@xmath276355 could be derived from different profiles of this line , for example , the absorption with smaller depth and larger width ( e.g. , 91t/99aa - like events ) or the other with larger depth and small width ( e.g. , nl ) .",
    "therefore , we divide the bright but generally normal members of ss into two subgroups , ss/91t - like and ss / nl , in the following discussion . on the other hand , @xcite proposed using the expansion velocity of the siii@xmath276355 line to distinguish the subclass with a higher siiivelocity ( hv ) from that with a normal velocity ( nv ) .",
    "the hv sne ia are found to have redder @xmath142 colors @xcite and different locations within host galaxies in comparison to the nv ones @xcite , suggesting that the properties of their progenitors may be different .",
    "the spectroscopy classification of sn 2013dy is compared with the large sne ia sample from the spectral spectral data sets of cfa @xcite and the berkeley supernova ia program @xcite at @xmath143 3 days .",
    "however , sn 2013dy resembles the normal sn 2003du and sn 2011fe observationally .",
    "the weak siiiabsorptions ( i.e. , @xmath170.7   and @xmath13.3   for siii@xmath276355 and @xmath275972 , respectively ) , however , put it into the transitional region of ss and cn at the near - side of the former in the @xcite diagram , as shown in figure [ < diver > ] ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish the ss/91t - like from ss / nl in this scheme .",
    "sn 2013dy is also close to the nl sn 2012fr .",
    "however , the 91t/99aa - like events keep away from nl sne ia in the @xcite diagram owing to the difference in velocity , as shown in figure [ < diver > ] ( b ) and ( d ) . in the @xcite scheme , sn 2013dy and sn 2012fr are also separated and the former resides at the border between the nv and the 91t/99aa - like subclasses . the slow decline rate ,",
    "the small ew of siiiabsorptions , and the low velocity gradient resemble the properties of the 91t/99aa - like objects . besides , the @xmath71 color of sn 2013dy is as blue as that of sn 1999aa at the early phase .",
    "however , the absence of fe  iii lines in the early spectra of sn 2013dy is a clear distinction from 91t/99aa - like events .",
    "we have presented extended observations of type ia sn 2013dy obtained at ljt , xlt , tnt and @xmath42-uovt . combined with the data published in z13 and p15 ,",
    "this target is a well - sampled sn ia with wide wavelength coverage ( i.e. , from @xmath11600   to @xmath118,000 ) . in general",
    ", this sn resembles the normal sne ia ( e.g. , sn 2003du and sn 2011fe ) in both photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "nevertheless , it also shares some similarities with the 99aa - like events , such as the @xmath71 and  @xmath75 \" color before maximum , the small decline rate , the low velocity gradient , and the small ratios of @xmath61(siii ) , @xmath61(s / fe ) and @xmath61(si / fe ) .",
    "however , the absence of fe  iii  lines in the early spectra of sn 2013dy might exclude it from 91t/99aa - like group .",
    "a problem is the uncertainty of the distance . in general , the distance ( i.e. , d @xmath115 20.0 mpc ) derived from several methods seems to be more reasonable than the estimations from the tully - fisher relation of the host galaxy ( i.e. , d @xmath115 13.7 mpc ) .",
    "based on the larger one , we estimated the peak brightness ( e.g. , @xmath144(b ) = @xmath145 mag ) , maximum bolometric luminosity ( [ @xmath146 \\times 10^{43}$ ] erg s@xmath7 ) and synthesized nickel mass ( 0.90 @xmath10 0.26 m@xmath11 ) .",
    "the distance derived from tully - fisher relation will yield fainter results ( i.e. , @xmath147 @xmath10 0.3 mag ; @xmath148 \\times10^{42}$ ] erg s@xmath7 ; @xmath9(@xmath8ni ) = 0.42 @xmath10 0.15m@xmath11 ) that are dimmer than the average of sne ia and do not follow the wlr of sne ia well .",
    "additionally , the @xmath58 band luminosity of sn 2013dy is at least 1.0 mag fainter than the average of sne ia .",
    "that might indicate inefficient emission translation from optical to nir for sn 2013dy or imply that this sn is an intrinsically fainter sne ia , although it shows a small @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath58 band photometry of sn 2013dy and sn 2011hr suggests a larger scatter ( i.e. , @xmath12.02.5 mag ) among the sne ia with a slow decline rate ( e.g. , @xmath12@xmath115 0.90 mag ) and might challenge the assumption of the uniform nir luminosity for sne ia .    on the other hand , it is difficult to put sn 2013dy into one certain subclass in the current classification system .",
    "the spectroscopy classification reveals that sn 2013dy might be a transitional event residing on the border of different subclasses , such as ss - cn in the @xcite classification scheme or nv-91t/99aa - like in the @xcite classification system .",
    "moreover , the diversity of the sne ia with small @xmath12and ews of siii ( e.g. , the superluminous sne ia , the 91t/99aa - like events , the sn 2012fr - like events , and sn 2013dy ) might imply the only ew criterion is insufficient for the classification of this sample and indicate a complex construction of their ejecta .",
