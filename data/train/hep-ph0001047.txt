    "high - energy elastic hadron collisions are realized mainly at small absolute values of four - momentum transfer squared @xmath4 .",
    "corresponding differential cross sections exhibit a typical diffractive behavior characterized by approximate exponential decrease for small @xmath4 , being followed by diffractive minimum . that has invoked a natural expectation that the hadron elastic processes are peripheral ( i.e.",
    ", correspond to higher impact parameter @xmath5 values ) in contradistinction to inelastic processes exhibiting a central character .",
    "however , the majority of models have described the high - energy elastic hadron collisions as central , i.e. , a significant part of elastic hadron collisions should occur at @xmath6 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) ; hadrons have been interpreted as transparent objects , which has represented a puzzle @xcite .",
    "the centrality of elastic processes has been shown @xcite to be a direct consequence of one basic assumption being involved in these models : imaginary part @xmath7 of elastic hadron scattering amplitude being regarded as dominant in a broad interval of @xmath8 around zero and vanishing only at the diffractive minimum .",
    "however , the dominance of imaginary part can be justified theoretically in a very small region of momentum transfers around forward direction only @xcite at very high @xmath9 center - of - momentum total energies .",
    "that does not eliminate peripheral behavior requiring @xmath7 to go to zero approximately at @xmath10 gev@xmath11 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the standard description of elastic hadron scattering involves , however , one puzzle more .",
    "it concerns the fact that diffractive production processes are being described as peripheral ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) even if they exhibit the characteristics very similar to elastic processes ( regarded at the same time as central ) and differing significantly ( like elastic hadron collisions ) from inelastic non - diffractive ones .",
    "all these problems seem to follow from the fact that only the modulus @xmath12 can be determined in the whole @xmath8 region from elastic experiments almost uniquely while amplitude phase remains arbitrary at least to some extent .",
    "its @xmath8 dependence can be estimated in principle from a small part of elastic scattering data only , i.e. , from a narrow interval of small @xmath4 where coulomb and hadron scatterings interfere . making use of sufficiently general parameterization of the @xmath8 dependent elastic hadron amplitude @xmath13 the peripheral interpretation of elastic hadron processes",
    "have been shown to be preferred @xcite , even if some characteristics can not be determined quite uniquely .",
    "nevertheless , some new features of colliding nucleons can be derived .",

    "only some admissible values can be established .",
    "in addition to , the root - mean - squared values of the impact parameters characterizing the range of forces responsible for the total , elastic and inelastic scatterings will be derived , too . some preliminary results concerning @xmath1 scattering case",

    "6 the problem of transparent nucleons in head - on collisions is discussed .",
    "transparent nucleons are to be considered as an _ artifact _ having nothing to do with the physical reality ; such a property follows directly from the _ a priori _ assumption of imaginary - part amplitude dominance .",
    "all presented results are based on the rigorous representation of elastic scattering amplitude in the impact parameter space ( valid at any @xmath17 and @xmath8 ) proposed by adachi and kotani @xcite ( our approach being based on ) , being described in appendix a.",
    "if the spins of colliding hadrons are not taken into account the elastic hadron scattering can be described fully with the complex elastic hadron scattering amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "this amplitude is bounded together with all production amplitudes @xmath18 by unitarity condition @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for an integration over all possible elastic intermediate states @xmath21 and @xmath22 includes summation over all possible production ( inelastic ) states as well as integration over all other kinematical variables ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are initial and final states .",

    "according to the optical theorem the imaginary part of the elastic hadron scattering amplitude in the forward direction is related to the total cross section by @xmath32 the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath33 in the impact parameter space can be obtained with the help of fourier - bessel ( fb ) transform of the elastic hadron scattering amplitude @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bessel function of the zeroth order . at finite energies",

    "such a picture has followed directly from the _ a priori _ assumption requiring the real part of amplitude to be neglected in a broad interval of @xmath8 around zero . if such a limitation is not applied to better fits of experimental data can be obtained .",
    "in such a case the elastic hadron scattering should be interpreted as a peripheral process . however , even if the peripherality is to be preferred the experimental data may hardly lead to unique picture , as equivalent @xmath45 values can be obtained with different degrees of peripherality ; the peripherality degree being characterized , e.g. , by the ratio of root - mean - squares of impact parameters for elastic and inelastic processes . even if the available experimental data do not allow to establish these values quite uniquely , they represent surely a more qualified physical characterization of hadron collision processes than the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( being added to @xmath48 ) .",

    "in such a case the root - means - square of elastic impact parameter ( for @xmath0 elastic scattering at energy of 53 gev , e.g. , 1.78@xmath3 1.80 fm , and for @xmath1 scattering at energy of 541 gev , e.g. , 2.24 @xmath3 2.35 fm ) are significantly higher than these for inelastic processes ( i.e. , 0.68 or 0.76 fm in these two cases - see table ii ) .",
    "peripheral behavior is preferred by the total @xmath45 values being significantly lower than for any alternatives requiring the central behavior .",
    "there is not , therefore , any reason to regard nucleons in elastic high - energy collisions as transparent objects .",
    "however , the nucleons can not be denoted as standard ( classical ) matter objects having a fixed dimension in the transverse direction at any time . on the basis of our analysis",
    "they can be regarded as objects with a rather hard core of diameter cca 0.4 @xmath3 0.8 fm and with a practically transparent outer shell of diameter 1.8 @xmath3 2.4 fm ; the given core being responsible for inelastic processes and the outer shell for elastic scattering ( or perhaps for some diffractive production processes , too ) .",
    "the value of core diameter is a little bit smaller than the proton charge diameter determined with the help of different charge distribution methods inside proton ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "such a collision structure may result from two different reasons .",
    "first , all experimental data must be regarded as an average over divers spin orientations . and a transverse momentum may correspond to different nucleon polarizations in individual events .",
    "the other reason might be related to the possibility that the dimensions of nucleons consisting of internal moving partons need not to be quite constant in all time .",
    "experiments with polarized nucleons might contribute to the solution of this problem .",
    "the new formulas describing elastic hadron scattering and presented in this paper have enabled to establish the impact parameter profiles for elastic and inelastic processes . the values of corresponding root - mean - squares may be taken as characteristics of the ranges of hadron forces responsible for elastic and inelastic collision processes .",
    "the corresponding numerical values were derived from experimental data of elastic @xmath0 scattering at energy of 53 gev and @xmath1 scattering at energy of 541 gev .",
    "they depend to some extent ( if not substantially ) on the peripherality degree imposed on the elastic profiles in establishing the @xmath8 dependence of elastic hadron scattering amplitude ( especially , of its phase ) from the experimental data .",
    "higher peripherality degrees are preferred by total @xmath45 values , which indicates that there is not any reason to regard protons as transparent objects in elastic high - energy collisions .",
    "the presented analysis also leads to the conclusion that it is not sufficient to characterize high - energy elastic collisions only by usual three quantities : total cross section @xmath48 , diffractive slope @xmath46 and the ratio @xmath47 of real to imaginary parts of elastic hadron amplitude in the forward direction .",
    "all these quantities depend on peripherality degree imposed , significant dependence being exhibited especially by the quantity @xmath47 .",
    "the presented results have opened a series of new questions concerning the actual structure of hadrons playing a role in collisions of different types .",
    "the approach used in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite starts from the possibility of defining the amplitude @xmath120 being identical with the elastic hadron amplitude @xmath34 in the physical @xmath8 region , while in the unphysical region of @xmath8 the amplitude @xmath120 equals unknown complex function @xmath121 which is assumed to be of a bounded variation for all @xmath8 values from @xmath122 and which further fulfilles condition that the integral @xmath123 is absolutely convergent .",
    "both the conditions guarantee ( according to hankel s theorem @xcite ) that @xmath120 has a fourier - bessel representation for @xmath124 .",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath33 can be then expressed as a sum of two terms @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 one can divide the inelastic overlap function into two parts in the same way @xcite @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 the real function @xmath131 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ gn2 ] ) is restricted by the same two conditions as function @xmath121 .",
    "it also holds @xcite @xmath132 consequently , the following unitarity equation in the impact parameter space can be written which binds together only the physically relevant amplitudes @xmath41 and @xmath133 @xcite : @xmath134 the function @xmath118 can be determined with the help of elastic hadron amplitude @xmath34 by @xmath135 . \\label{cf1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath118 vanishes at @xmath44 and @xmath136 .",
    "adachi and kotani @xcite showed then that contrary to general belief the functions @xmath137 and @xmath133 can not be non - negative at all finite positive @xmath5 at finite @xmath17 .",
    "it must hold only @xmath138 and both the functions @xmath137 and @xmath133 must vanish when @xmath5 tends to @xmath139 . at higher finite values of @xmath5",
    "these functions should oscillate .",
    "the oscillations vanish at infinite energies only .    multiplying the both sides of eq .",
    "( [ mv14 ] ) by @xmath140 and integrating over the all possible impact parameter values @xmath5 one obtaines in our normalization @xmath141 which shows that the function @xmath118 fulfills the condition : @xmath142 here @xmath14 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the total , elastic and inelastic cross sections defined as integrals @xmath145 where @xmath146 stands for one of the amplitudes @xmath43 , @xmath100 or @xmath147 .",
    "all the integrals @xmath148 in eq .",
    "( [ cs1 ] ) have the physical meaning as introduced earlier but only @xmath42 is non - negative at any @xmath5 .",
    "thus , only @xmath42 can be interpreted as the density distribution ( i.e. , of elastic hadron scattering ) in the impact parameter space .",
    "the other functions @xmath137 and @xmath133 can turn to oscillate at some higher values of @xmath5 ; therefore , they can not be interpreted directly as corresponding density distributions .",
    "however , they can be modified to fulfil such a goal . adding a suitable real function @xmath117 , fulfilling the condition @xmath149 to the both sides of unitarity equation ( [ mv14 ] )",
    ", both the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 can be brought to be non - negative for all the values of @xmath5 .",
    "such a function @xmath117 exists owing to the properties of function @xmath152 , or equivalently owing to properties of the function @xmath153 defined in the unphysical region of @xmath8 .",
    "then the functions @xmath57 and @xmath147 can be regarded as new density distributions of the total and inelastic scatterings in the impact parameter space and one has instead of unitarity equation ( [ mv14 ] ) the modified unitarity condition @xmath154 thus , we have in principle a fully consistent description of elastic scattering in the impact parameter space .                    v. kundrt , m. lokajek and d. krupa , `` hadron structure and the @xmath47 value in high - energy elastic hadron collisions '' , _ hadron structure 98 conference _ , sept . 7 - 13 , 1998 , star lesn , slovakia , ed",
