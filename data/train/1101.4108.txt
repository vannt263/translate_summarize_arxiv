    "many of the over 380 exoplanets discovered to date orbit solar mass ( 0.71.5 @xmath1 ) stars .",
    "this observational bias occurs because the main targets of previous doppler spectroscopy - based exoplanet searches have been solar - type stars .",
    "these studies have revealed a variety of their planetary systems ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) whose statistical properties are now used to constrain planet - formation models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , only about 35 and 25 planets were detected around intermediate - mass ( 1.55 @xmath1 ) and low - mass ( @xmath3 0.7 @xmath1 ) stars in surveys of evolved g - k type ( sub ) giants and k - m type dwarfs , respectively , so far .",
    "the planetary systems around such stars are not well understood .",
    "clarifying the relationship between stellar mass and planetary system is important for understanding general planet formation because planet formation should depend on the properties of the protoplanetary disks , which be affected by the condition of host stars",
    ".    evolved intermediate - mass ( sub ) giant stars are suitable targets for doppler spectroscopy - based planet searches because these stars have low surface activity and their spectra exhibit many sharp absorption lines .",
    "although the number of substellar companions found orbiting such stars is still small , some planetary system properties have begun to emerge .",
    "for example , the masses of planets and their host stars are correlated : more massive substellar companions tend to exist around more massive stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this correlation suggests that the mass ranges of the brown dwarf desert depend on the host star mass @xcite .",
    "the planet occurrence rate also depends on the host star mass : the planet frequency around 1.52 @xmath1 giant stars is higher than that around lower - mass stars @xcite .",
    "moreover , the semi - major axes of planetary systems seem to be correlated with host star : the range for planets orbiting intermediate - mass giant stars exceeds 0.6 au , and the range for planets around solar - type stars is large than 0.02 au ( e.g. @xcite ) . these properties of substellar systems around intermediate - mass giant stars seem to be not similar to those around solar - type stars . a unified understanding of planetary systems over a wide range of host star masses will provide valuable insights into the dependence of substellar systems on the central stars and into general plant formation mechanisms .",
    "in 2005 , we started a joint planet search program between korean and japanese researchers to search for planets around gk - type giant stars using a precise doppler technique with using the 1.8-m telescope at boao and the 1.88-m telescope at oao @xcite .",
    "this survey program is an extended version of the ongoing oao planet search program @xcite and part of an international collaboration among researchers from korea , china and japan ( an east - asian planet search network , eaps - net ; @xcite ) .",
    "the collaboration aims at clarifying the properties of planetary systems around intermediate - mass stars by surveying more than 800 gk giants for planets at oao , boao , the xinglong station ( china ) , and the subaru telescope .    for the korean - japanese planet search program , we selected about 190 target stars from the @xmath4 catalog based on the following criteria : color - index 0.6 @xmath3 @xmath5 @xmath3 1.0 , absolute magnitude @xmath63 @xmath3 @xmath7 @xmath3 2 , declination @xmath8 @xmath2 @xmath625 @xmath9 , and visual magnitude 6.2 @xmath3 @xmath10 @xmath3 6.5 @xcite .",
    "these targets are fainter than those of the oao and xinglong program ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we divided the targets into two parts : one for boao and the other for oao .",
    "each is observed independently at the assigned observatory , although a star that exhibits a large radial velocity variation is observed intensively at both observatories .",
    "radial velocity observations at boao are carried out with the 1.8-m telescope and the boao echelle spectrograph ( boes ; @xcite ) , a fiber - fed high resolution echelle spectrograph .",
    "we place an iodine ( i@xmath11 ) cell in the optical path in front of the fiber entrance of the spectrograph @xcite for precise wavelength calibration and use a 200-@xmath12 m fiber , obtaining a wavelength resolution @xmath13 = @xmath14/@xmath15 @xmath16 51000 .",
    "the spectra cover the 350010500   wavelength range .",
    "echelle data reduction is performed using the iraf software package in the standard manner .",
    "we use the 5000   to 5900   wavelength range , a region covered by many i@xmath11 absorption lines , for radial velocity measurements .",
    "we also make use of ca ii h lines at around 3970   as chromospheric activity diagnostics .",
    "radial velocity analysis is performed using the spectral modeling technique described in @xcite , which is based on the method of @xcite , and improve and optimize for boes data analysis @xcite .",
    "we employ the extraction method described in @xcite to prepare a stellar template spectrum from stellar spectra taken through the i@xmath11 cell ( star+i@xmath11 spectra ) .",
    "the technique allows us to achieve a long - term doppler precision of 14 m s@xmath17 over 5.5 yr .",
    "radial velocity observations at oao are carried out with the 1.88-m telescope and high dispersion echelle spectrograph ( hides ; @xcite ) attached to the coud focus of the telescope .",
    "we use an i@xmath11 cell placed in the optical path in front of the slit of the spectrograph @xcite as a precise wavelength calibrator .",
    "we set the slit width to 200 @xmath12 m ( 0.76 \" ) , providing a spectral resolution of 63000 . until november 2007",
    ", we had taken star+i@xmath11 spectra with the 5000   to 6200   wavelength range , and had taken stellar spectra at the same wavelength range without the i@xmath11 cell for abundance analysis . since the hides ccd system was upgraded to a three ccd mosaic in december 2007 , we obtain simultaneous spectra in the full 3750   to 7550   wavelength range .",
    "we use the 5000   to 5900   wavelength ranges of star+i@xmath11 spectra for radial velocity measurements .",
    "echelle data reduction is performed using the iraf software package in the standard manner .",
    "stellar radial velocities are derived from the i@xmath11-superposed stellar spectrum using the spectral modeling techniques detailed in @xcite , giving a doppler precision of less than 8 m s@xmath17 over 5.5 yr .",
    "up to now , we have been monitoring the radial velocities of sample stars using 1.8-m boao telescope and 1.88-m oao telescope for 5.5 yr and identified many candidate stars with large radial velocity variations .",
    "and then , two massive intermediate - mass stars with a periodic variation caused by a substellar companion are found among them : a brown dwarf - mass companion orbiting hd119445 @xcite and a planetary companion orbiting a giant star .",
    "we monitored the radial velocity of hd 119445 for 2.3 years from the beginning of the survey at both observatories .",
    "the observed radial velocities of hd 119445 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the best - fit keplerian orbit derived from both the boao and oao data has a period @xmath18 @xmath19 410.2 @xmath20 0.6 days , a velocity semi - amplitude @xmath21 @xmath19 413.5 @xmath20 2.6 m s@xmath17 , and an eccentricity @xmath22 @xmath19 0.082 @xmath20 0.007 .",

    "a large radial velocity variation in the giant star with a planetary companion was found in the early boao radial velocity survey and we made intensive follow - up observations of the star at boao and oao .",

    "has a period @xmath18 @xmath19 157.57 d , a velocity semi - amplitude @xmath21 @xmath19 35.2 m s@xmath17 , and an eccentricity @xmath22 @xmath19 0.085 .",

    "the rms of the residuals to the best - fit are 11.2 m s@xmath17 for boao and oao data .",
    "this values is comparable to the typical radial velocity scatter of the g - type giants @xcite . adopting a host star s mass @xmath23 = 2.4 ( 2.02.6 ) @xmath1 , which was estimated from evolutionary track and fundamental stellar parameters of @xmath26 = 43 @xmath27 , @xmath28 = 4861 k , and [ fe / h ] = 0.15 , we obtained a semi - major axis @xmath24 = 0.77 au and a minimum mass @xmath25 = 1.7 @xmath0 for a planetary companion .",
    "their host stars , hd119445 and the giant star , have masses of 3.9 @xmath1 and 2.4 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the brown dwarf - mass companion orbiting hd 119445 is most massive substellar companions , and the planetary companion orbiting the giant star is lowest - mass companion , among those discovered around massive intermediate - mass ( 1.95 @xmath1 ) stars . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot masses of the companions detected within semi - major axis of 3 au by precise doppler surveys against their host star s masses ; solar - mass stars ( 0.7 @xmath1 @xmath29 @xmath23 @xmath3 1.5 @xmath1 , _ open triangles _ ) , intermediate - mass subgiants and giants ( 1.5 @xmath1 @xmath29 @xmath23 @xmath29 5 @xmath1 , _ filled circles _ ) , intermediate - mass dwarfs ( _ open circles _ ) , and hd 119445 and the giant star ( _ stars _ ) ( e.g. _ the extrasolar planets encyclopadia _ ; updated version of figure 5 in @xcite ; this work ) .",
    "the detectable companion mass for a given host star mass depends on the orbital separation of its companion and the radial velocity jitter of the host star . assuming that typical radial velocity jitters @xmath30 for solar - mass stars , intermediate - mass subgiants ( 1.51.9 @xmath1 ) and giants ( 1.95 @xmath1 ) are @xmath16 5 m s@xmath17 , @xmath16 7 m s@xmath17 and @xmath16 20 m s@xmath17 , respectively , we estimated the lower limits of companion masses detectable by precise doppler surveys around a solar - mass star and intermediate - mass subgiant and giant at 3 au ( sold lines in figure [ fig1 ] ) , corresponding to companion masses that provide the amplitude of three times of typical radial velocity jitters .",
    "we also indicate detectable masses for these stars at 0.02 au ( _ dotted lines _ ) and 0.6 au ( _ dot - dashed lines _ ) , corresponding to the semi - major axes of the known innermost planets orbiting solar - type and intermediate - mass evolved stars .",
    "two unpopulated regions of substellar companions orbiting intermediate - mass subgiants and giants seem to exist in region ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "a possible host star - companion mass correlation considered from unpopulated region ( a ) and ( b ) supports the current view that more massive substellar companions tend to exist around more massive stars , that are derived from the results of planet searches around various mass stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "all of the brown dwarf - mass companions to intermediate - mass evolved stars were found around those with @xmath31 2.7 @xmath1 and there seems to be a paucity of such companions around those with 1.52.7 @xmath1 ( region ( a ) in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "considering the smaller number of survey targets of @xmath31 2.7 @xmath1 ( e.g. , 35 % of the 300 oao targets ; @xcite ) compared with that of 1.52.7 @xmath1 , frequency of brown dwarf companions may become higher as stellar mass increases .",
    "this might favor gravitational instability in protostellar disks @xcite rather than fragmentation of proto - stellar clouds @xcite as the formation mechanism of brown dwarf - mass companions because stellar systems with larger difference in mass between primary and secondary stars are more difficult to form by the latter mechanism @xcite .",
    "also , there seems to be a possible paucity of lower - mass companions around 2.4@xmath162.64 @xmath1 stars , in particular , a lack of planetary companions around 34 @xmath1 stars ( region ( b ) in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "although it is basically difficult to detect planets around such `` noisy '' stars with large intrinsic radial velocity variability ( @xmath30 @xmath16 20 m s@xmath17 ) , planets with mass @xmath31 2.63.3 @xmath0 ( @xmath31 5.77.4 @xmath0 ) and @xmath24 @xmath19 0.6 au ( @xmath24 @xmath19 3.0 au ) should be above the current detection limit ( 3 @xmath30 @xmath16 60 m s@xmath17 ) .",
    "@xcite predicted that the frequency of giant planets has a peak near 3 @xmath1 stars based on a core accretion scenario taking account of the movement of snow line along the evolution of accretion and the central stars .",
    "moreover , if a formation mechanism works that invokes capturing of solid bodies migrating inward at the inner edge of the inactive magnetorotational instability - dead zone inside of the protoplanetary disk , gas giant planets could be formed efficiently at around 1 au around intermediate - mass stars before the planetary disks deplete @xcite .",
    "increasing the number of known massive planetary companions around massive intermediate - mass stars by further radial velocity surveys would be of great interest to understand the formation mechanisms of giant planets around intermediate - mass stars .     of 5 m s@xmath17 for solar - mass stars ( 0.7 @xmath1 @xmath29 @xmath23 @xmath3 1.5 @xmath1 ) , 7 m s@xmath17 for intermediate - mass subgiants ( 1.5 @xmath1 @xmath29",
