    "the subject of this work is to investigate the behavior of a michelson interferometer in the presence of a plane gravitational wave .",
    "sources of gravitational waves include the collapse of massive stars in supernova explosions , and the coalescence of stars in binary systems containing a neutron star and/or a black hole .",
    "the large distances from these objects allow us to assume that the gravitational waves detected on the earth may be regarded as plane waves .",
    "gravitational waves were predicted by einstein in his general theory of relativity  @xcite as perturbations of the spacetime metric that propagate at the speed of light .",
    "plane gravitational waves were considered first by rosen  @xcite , taub  @xcite , and mcvittie  @xcite , and their work seemed to indicate that such waves may not physically exist .",
    "however , bondi , pirani , and robinson @xcite proved that this conclusion was wrong , and that these waves not only exist but also carry energy .",
    "exact solutions of the einstein equations , which describe plane gravitational waves , have also been developed in  @xcite . in 1975 ,",
    "hulse and taylor found indirect proof for the existence of gravitational waves by observing the pulsar psr 1913 + 16  @xcite .",
    "they noticed that the orbital parameters of this pulsar were changing according to a model assuming that such a system radiates gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "this discovery was awarded with the nobel prize in physics in 1993 .",
    "research on the possibility of detecting gravitational waves was started in the 1960s by weber  @xcite , who constructed the first resonant - mass antenna . his results claiming the discovery of gravitational waves  @xcite",
    "could not be confirmed by other groups who built similar detectors . in the 1970s ,",
    "another method of detection was suggested using laser interferometry  @xcite .",
    "current and planned ground - based laser interferometric detectors include aigo ( australia )  @xcite , geo 600 ( germany / uk )  @xcite , ligo ( usa )  @xcite , tama 300 ( japan )  @xcite , and virgo ( france / italy )  @xcite . the first search for signals from neutron stars in ligo and geo 600 data did not find direct evidence for gravitational waves  @xcite , but gave upper limits on the strength of periodic gravitational radiation  @xcite . in 2011 ,",
    "esa and nasa plan to launch lisa  @xcite , a space project that will be able to make observations in a low - frequency band that is not achievable by ground - based observatories .",
    "a bibliography on gravitational wave theory and experiment through 1999 is listed in  @xcite .",
    "since the search for gravitational waves is mainly based on interferometry , we consider a michelson interferometer in the presence of a plane gravitational wave .",
    "the effect of such a wave on a light beam , using the linearized coupled einstein - maxwell equations , was studied in  @xcite .",
    "however , these equations in the quadratic approximation may lead to quite lengthy expressions .",
    "instead , we can treat the light beam as photons whose motion is determined by the geodesic equations for a massless particle .",
    "the equations of motion for a particle in the metric of a strong gravitational wave  @xcite were derived by ebner  @xcite , and all seven integrals of motion can be found in the literature , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a simple model of a michelson interferometer in the field of such a wave , based on the above equations of motion , was proposed by baaski  @xcite . here",
    ", we generalize this model to the second ( quadratic ) approximation . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a monochromatic plane gravitational wave whose direction is parallel to one arm of the interferometer and perpendicular to the other .",
    "since the energy of gravitational waves contains the factor @xmath0 , the amplitude for such waves is very small .",
    "therefore , second - order effects in gravitational - wave detection are irrelevant experimentally , although it might be interesting to explore them .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we introduce a plane gravitational wave and review the equations of motion for a test particle . in section  3",
    "we study the behavior of a michelson interferometer under the action of this wave in the first ( linear ) approximation . in section  4",
    "we proceed to the second approximation .",
    "the results are summarized in section  5 . for the metric tensor and the curvature tensor",
    "we use the conventions of  @xcite .",
    "in this section we derive the motion of a test particle in the presence of a plane gravitational wave  @xcite using the relativistic hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "let us consider the metric tensor whose components are functions of only one variable @xmath1 , @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", it can be shown  @xcite that the spacetime interval in vacuum is of the form @xmath3 where the letters @xmath4 refer to the coordinates @xmath5 .",
    "for a plane wave propagating in the direction of the @xmath6 axis we have @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "if the interval is given by equation  ( [ eq : int ] ) then all components of the ricci tensor identically vanish except @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and the dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the einstein field equations in the case of a plane gravitational wave reduce to one equation , @xmath11 .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation for a particle with mass @xmath12 moving in the gravitational field described by the metric in ( [ eq : int ] ) is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a principal function .",

    ". the world line of a particle is determined by jacobi s theorem , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the constants in the principal function ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 are new constants . introducing a finite interval @xmath27 as a parameter such that @xmath28 yields @xmath29 .",
    "the equations of motion for a massive particle in the field of a plane gravitational wave in terms of @xmath27 are   @xmath30    in a similar manner , we can determine the equations of null geodesic lines in the presence of a plane gravitational wave .",

    "let us consider three observers at rest : @xmath50 let a light beam leave the world point @xmath51 in the direction of a plane wave , and arrive at the point @xmath52",
    ". in this case equations ( @xmath49 ) lead to @xmath53 which gives @xmath54 . then , let this light beam leave the point @xmath52 and arrive at the point @xmath55 ( return to the initial space point ) .",
    "consequently , the equations of motion ( @xmath44 ) are @xmath56 therefore @xmath57 .",
    "next , let us consider a light beam leaving the point @xmath51 in the direction perpendicular to that of the gravitational wave , and arriving at @xmath58 . in this case equations ( @xmath44 ) give @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "we obtain the equation for @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "then , let the same light beam go from the point @xmath64 to the initial space point @xmath65 .",
    "the equations of motion are ( with different constants of motion ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 . in a similar manner",
    "we obtain @xmath68 where @xmath69 .    a weak plane gravitational wave in metric ( [ eq : int ] )",
    "can be described by the two - dimensional metric tensor @xmath70 , \\label{met}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are small quantities   and @xmath73 , then the metric tensor  ( [ met ] ) identically satisfies the field equation @xmath11 . ] .",
    "the two possible polarizations correspond to setting either quantity to zero .",
    "let us consider a polarization such that @xmath74 and denote it by @xmath75 . from this we find @xmath76 , where @xmath48 is the amplitude of the gravitational wave .",
    "we can linearize equation  ( @xmath77 ) , omitting terms quadratic and smaller in @xmath48 : @xmath78 the analogous expression can be derived for equation  ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "let us assume that a plane gravitational wave is monochromatic with wavelength @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "we seek the solution of equation  ( [ lin ] ) in the form @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a small quantity on the order of @xmath48 . keeping only linear terms in @xmath83",
    "we find @xmath84 similarly , for the returning beam we have @xmath85 , where @xmath86 where we used @xmath87 since this term is on the order of @xmath48 .",
    "finally , the total delay of the light beam moving perpendicular to the gravitational wave , relative to the parallel beam , is given by @xmath88    the other polarization ( denoted by @xmath89 ) is described by the metric tensor @xmath90.\\ ] ] in this case , equation  ( @xmath77 ) reduces to @xmath87 , whereas for the returning beam we find @xmath91 .",
    "for this polarization there is no delay .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : del ] ) is what experimentalists use to detect gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "its relation to incoming gravitational waves with arbitrary propagation directions and polarization states can be found in the literature , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this equation agrees with the corresponding expression in  @xcite if we set the departure moment @xmath92 and use the relation @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the light beam frequency and @xmath95 denotes the phase shift .",
    "therefore , treating light as massless particles in the field of a weak gravitational wave and solving the linearized coupled einstein - maxwell equations lead to the same result .",
    "the delay of a light beam depends on the quantity @xmath96 , which corresponds to the moment when the beam leaves the start point ( the time dependence of the gravitational field is fixed by the form of @xmath71 ) . if the wavelength of a monochromatic gravitational wave is small compared to the size of the interferometer , we can average this delay over @xmath96 : @xmath97 . the physical reason for averaging arises from the fact that we do not know when the front of a gravitational wave hits the point of the departure of the beam",
    ". however , as for each periodic function , such an expression vanishes and is of no interest .",
    "in this section we will generalize the results of the preceding section and consider quadratic terms .",
    "let the two - dimensional metric tensor @xmath98 of a weak gravitational wave be given by @xmath99,\\ ] ] where @xmath100 are small quantities on the same order . in the linear approximation @xmath101 , where @xmath48 is the amplitude of such a wave on the order of @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality we may assume @xmath103 .",
    "the field equation is obtained from @xmath11 : @xmath104 which gives @xmath105 as a function of @xmath102 and @xmath106 .",
    "if we consider a polarization @xmath75 with @xmath107 and put @xmath87 in terms on the order of @xmath108 , then equation  ( @xmath77 ) becomes @xmath109 note that this equation does not contain the quantity @xmath105 .",
    "let us apply the above results to the case of a monochromatic plane wave , @xmath110 .",
    "for such a wave , equation  ( [ eq : field ] ) leads to @xmath111 , and this quantity clearly is not a periodic function of @xmath1  , but then equation .",
    "( [ bd ] ) would contain the nonperiodic function @xmath112 .",
    "thus , it would be impossible to average the light beam delay over @xmath96 ( the moment when the beam leaves the start point ) independently of the initial conditions . ] .",
    "we seek the solution in the form @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is again a small quantity on the same order as @xmath48 .",
    "thus , up to quadratic terms in @xmath83 we obtain @xmath113 the above expression contains the quadratic corrections to equation  ( [ delay ] ) .",
    "the mean value of this quantity over the moment of the departure of the beam @xmath96 , @xmath114 , is now different from zero : @xmath115 we remind that the moment @xmath96 is relative to the instant when a front of the gravitational wave in question hits the departure point , and we average with respect to @xmath96 since we do not know the value of this quantity .    for the returning beam we must replace @xmath61 with @xmath116 and @xmath96 with @xmath61 ( since the beam departs from the reflection point right after it arrives there ) , which gives @xmath85 , where @xmath117 is described by equation  ( @xmath118 ) in which @xmath96 is replaced with @xmath119 .",
    "the result is @xmath120 therefore , the total average delay of the light beam is given by @xmath121 we observe that @xmath122 is negative for all values of @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath123 , then the light beam moving perpendicular to the direction of a gravitational wave lags ( on average with respect to the departure moment @xmath96 ) behind the one which moves parallel , provided both beams left the light source at the same time .",
    "the dependence of the quantity @xmath124 on the variable @xmath125 is shown in figure  [ pic1 ] .",
    "the normalized average light beam delay @xmath126 as a function of the normalized wave frequency @xmath127 for the polarization @xmath75 .",
    ", width=240 ]    now we consider the other polarization @xmath89 for which @xmath128 .",
    "equation  ( @xmath129 ) is replaced by @xmath130 for a monochromatic plane wave , @xmath131 , instead of equation  ( [ eq:31 ] ) we find @xmath132 the returning beam again satisfies formula ( [ di ] ) .",
    "averaging over the departure moment @xmath96 gives @xmath133 we see that @xmath122 is negative for all values of the length of a gravitational wave , and tends asymptotically to zero as @xmath134 . in figure  [ pic2 ]",
    "we show the function @xmath135 .",
    "note that for both polarizations @xmath136 as @xmath137 .",
    "the normalized average light beam delay @xmath126 as a function of the normalized wave frequency @xmath127 for the polarization @xmath89 .",
    ", width=240 ]    from figures [ pic1 ] and [ pic2 ] we conclude that a one - to - one relation between the average light beam delay and the wavelength exists only for waves longer than @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , the precision of the measurement of the delay is proportional to the length of the arms of the interferometer .",
    "therefore , if we try to increase the precision by increasing this length , we end up with decrease of the range of waves measurable in this way .",
    "in this work we showed that the time delay of a light beam in a michelson interferometer , obtained by treating light as massless particles moving on geodesics , agrees with the corresponding solution of the linearized coupled einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "we also calculated this delay in the second ( quadratic ) approximation .",
    "we considered the simple case of a plane wave with the direction parallel to one arm of the interferometer , and treated the two polarizations separately .",
    "however in reality , one should expect a broad spectrum of frequencies and a combination of both polarizations .",
    "averaging the light beam delay @xmath139 over the moment of the departure of the beam @xmath96 would make sense if either wavelength @xmath80 is much smaller than the arm length @xmath140 or we measure @xmath122 many times . since we excluded the former , this method would not work in the case of supernova explosions that radiate significantly for a few seconds only .",
    "instead , the presented model could be used ( in principle ) for continuous sources of gravitational waves such as stellar binaries containing a neutron star . as we stated in section  1 ,",
    "second - order effects in gravitational - wave detection are extremely small and thus irrelevant experimentally .",
    "however , they might be of some academic interest .",
