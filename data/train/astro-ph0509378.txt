    "the work presented is derived from an attempt to understand a surprising result from the hi  parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ) : the non - detection of isolated , galactic - scale concentrations of hi  with no significant stellar counterpart  baryonic dark galaxies or ` galaxies without stars ' @xcite .",
    "we have presented this study in @xcite : we find that an hi  surface density as low as several m@xmath3  pc@xmath5 is sufficient to self - shield against h@xmath6  photodissociation by the cosmic background radiation ; we argue that within this self - shielded region , a relative h@xmath6  abundance of as little as 10@xmath7 is sufficient to initiate a transition to a cold ( @xmath8 k ) phase , which greatly increases the chances of gravothermal ( toomre ) instability . in short , we conclude that dark galaxies are , at best , exceedingly rare , because _ there is no mechanism to prevent star formation _ ; wherever possible , self - shielding hi  will develop an h@xmath6component that is sufficient to initiate gravothermal instability .",
    "the situation changes once sf is initiated : short - lived o  b stars then provide a second source of photodissociating radiation , much as in photodissociation regions in our own galaxy .",
    "using this idea of self - regulated star formation  the gravothermal stability of an hi  cloud preserved by photodissociative frustration of h@xmath6cooling @xcite  we then set out to determine the minimum sfr in a galactic - scale concentration of hi .",
    "the details of this calculation are presented in @xcite and we do not repeat them here . in essence , the argument is this : we solve for the uv ( isrf ) energy density required prevent h@xmath6production / cooling and subsequent instabilities ; knowing the uv output and lifetime of a massive star , and assuming a standard imf , it is then possible to determine the sfr required to provide this uv radiation , @xmath9 . we emphasise that since we were interested primarily in ` galaxies without stars ' ( _ ie .",
    "_  the complete preventation of star formation ) we deliberately tailored our assumptions to produce a lower limit on the predicted h@xmath6  abundance and rate of cooling , so making star formation as difficult as possible : in particular , we have allowed ` maximum damage ' by photodissociating photons by ignoring internal extinction , and ignored all effects of dust and metals .",
    "we model the gas distribution using the formalism of @xcite , in which each cloud is described by three parameters : the virial mass , @xmath10 , the spin parameter @xmath11 , and the disk mass fraction @xmath12 ; in all cases , @xmath13 is between 0.56 and 0.70 . for each combination of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath14 : our predicted @xmath0sfr relation is shown in figure 1 , along with observed values taken from the literature .",
    "we note with interest that this relation has the same power as the empirical schmidt sf law , sfr@xmath15 .",
    "the slope of the relation is driven by the distribution of the densest gas in galaxy centres , since it is this gas that requires the most radiation to maintain thermal stability .",
    "the scatter is set primarily by the distribution of galactic spins , as well as variations in the relative mass of the disk in comparison to the halo , since , for a fixed mass , these determine the density near the centre . because the model was designed to place a lower limit on the sfr , it can not predict the zero - point of such a relation . within the self - shielded region ,",
    "the h@xmath6  cooling rate is typically less than 110 percent of the net cooling rate ; a significantly higher isrf might be required to balance these other cooling mechanisms . moreover ,",
    "if there were , for example , a systematic run with mass in the relative contribution of metal - line cooling in comparison to h@xmath6  cooling , the inclusion of metals might alter the predicted slope of the relation .",
    "we stress that this would only be true , however , if metal - line cooling were important in _ initiating _ the transition from warm to cold .",
    "even though the observational samples were constructed to include widely disparate populations , these populations are not readily distinguished in figure [ fig : mhi - sfr ] for nor are ` extreme ' objects like ddo 154 and eso215-g?009 distinguished from ` normal ' dwarfs in the @xmath0sfr plane . in the mass range @xmath16@xmath17 , it seems that essentially all ( hi  detected ) galaxies are presently forming stars in the same way : galaxies follow a tight sequence in the @xmath0sfr plane .",
    "moreover , we argue that the general agreement between the character of the predicted and observed @xmath0sfr relations lends weight to the physical picture on which our simple model is based : the results in figure [ fig : mhi - sfr ] suggest that the well observed population of dwarf galaxies represent the minimum rate of isrf - regulated sf in galaxies .",
