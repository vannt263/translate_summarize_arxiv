    "many systems , such as colloidal suspensions , and polymer blends and solutions , contain particles with an effectively continuous distributions of an attribute ( @xmath1 , say ) such as size , charge , or chemical character .",
    "such systems are termed polydisperse @xcite .",
    "their phase equilibria can become complicated , but may exhibit relatively simple features including coexistence of two liquid phases of different composition . in some cases the tendency to phase separate is inherited from the underlying monodisperse physics ( e.g. attractive colloids ) ; in others it stems only from polydispersity ( e.g. fractionation among chains with a spectrum of chemical compositions ) .    in a polydisperse system undergoing fluid - fluid demixing , the phase diagram looks rather different from that of a simple binary mixture even if the underlying physics is similar .",
    "it is common experimentally to draw the phase diagram on a composition / temperature plane ; one effect of polydispersity is then to split the binodal curve into cloud and shadow curves that cross at the critical point .",
    "( the latter is not at the maximum of either curve . )",
    "this is because , when a system is cooled to the point where it becomes globally unstable to phase separation ( the cloud point ) , the incipient new phase ( its shadow ) differs from the old one not only in the number of particles per unit volume , as usual , but in its @xmath1-distribution . because of this difference , the incipient new phase does not itself represent a point on the cloud curve .",
    "( however , it does lie on the cloud curve of a _ different system _ whose overall size distribution coincides with that of the incipient , shadow phase ) .",
    "an interesting question is whether all this behavior can be captured within a landau expansion .",
    "there are at least two reasons to consider this .",
    "firstly , conceptual ( as well as practical ) progress has been made recently in understanding phase equilibria in polydisperse systems within a certain class of mean - field models : those in which the excess free energy depends on the @xmath1 distribution only through a finite set of moments @xcite .",
    "a promising method involves projecting the free energy onto a relatively small number of densities ; when these are chosen correctly , the cloud , shadow , and spinodal curves , and with them any critical points , are found without approximation beyond those used to set up the mean - field free energy in the first place .    due to",
    "their mean - field character and restricted set of relevant densities , such projection techniques should be reconcilable with a landau expansion near the critical point  yet the unusual topology of the phase diagram appears , at first sight , to preclude this . in particular , the usual adoption of a quartic expansion in one density ( with coefficients dependent only on temperature )",
    "is bound to exhibit a critical point at the apex of a binodal curve .",
    "we show below that a more careful landau expansion does not suffer from this restriction , and instead reproduces the correct , more complicated behavior outlined above .    a second reason to study the landau expansion is in the hope of going beyond mean field theory . experimental values for",
    "the critical exponents of a polydisperse system @xcite deviate from those of the monodisperse case and are consistent with fisher - renormalised exponents @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , there is no explicit renormalization group calculation for a polydisperse system .",
    "also , quite apart from calculating critical indices , it is important for many purposes ( see e.g. @xcite ) to properly classify and identify the scaling fields near the critical point , and this task can not really be begun without a consistent description at the landau level .",
    "hence the landau expansion presented below represents a first step towards a fuller understanding of polydisperse critical behavior beyond mean field level .",
    "in this section we review briefly the classical landau expansion of the free energy around the critical point for a simple monodisperse system . this will facilitate a comparison with the polydisperse case and establish the notation .    in a canonical ensemble ,",
    "the free energy @xmath2 is defined as a function of the temperature @xmath3 , the number of particles @xmath4 and the volume @xmath5 . in the thermodynamic limit , however , we can define a reduced free energy ( density ) as @xmath6 which is a function only of the density of particles @xmath7 and the temperature . at fixed temperature ,",
    "any terms that are constant or linear in density are irrelevant for obtaining the phase equilibrium of the system ( which is our main aim ) since they can be assimilated into shifts of the entropy and of the chemical potential .      within the mean field approximation , which is where the landau expansion holds",
    ", the critical point must obey one condition common to all points on the spinodal curve , @xmath8 and a second condition particular to the critical point , @xmath9 where @xmath10 means evaluated at the critical point @xmath11 .",
    "once the critical point is determined , the expansion follows as usual :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 .",
    "we forget about the constant and linear terms since , as described above , they can be viewed as ( temperature dependent ) shifts in the entropy and chemical potential with no effect on phase behavior .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion depend on the temperature and can be expanded themselves about the critical temperature .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ mspinodal ] ) and ( [ mcritpoint ] ) , and keeping the lowest order term for each coefficient , we obtain :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 . since @xmath16 ( see eq .",
    "( [ mcoex ] ) below ) the term in @xmath17 is of higher order and can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the lowest order expansion of the free energy has the simple form :    @xmath18    for appropriate @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the coexisting phases obey the standard result @xmath21 giving the well - known parabolic shape of the phase diagram around the critical point for monodisperse systems ( always within the mean field approximation ) .",
    "in the polydisperse case , the particles are not all identical but differ in certain scalar attributes ( particle radius , charge , chain length ... ) which can be tagged with indices @xmath22 . for simplicity",
    ", we focus on systems with just one polydisperse index @xmath1 , and write the corresponding density of particles as @xmath23 . in this case",
    ", the free energy can be written as two parts , an ideal term and an excess term , as follows @xcite : @xmath24=\\int\\!\\!d{\\sigma}\\,\\ ; \\rho(\\sigma)\\left\\{\\log\\left(\\rho(\\sigma)\\right)-1\\right\\ } +   f_{ex}[\\rho].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while the ideal part only depends on @xmath23 as shown , the excess part @xmath25 is , in general , an arbitrary functional of @xmath23 and a function of @xmath3 . here , in order to explore how polydispersity affects the landau expansion around the critical point in a tractable manner , we restrict ourselves to cases where the functional dependence of the excess part of the free energy on the density distribution @xmath23 is through a single ` generalized moment ' @xcite of the distribution :    @xmath26=\\int\\!\\!d{\\sigma}\\,\\ ; \\rho(\\sigma)\\left\\{\\log\\left(\\rho(\\sigma)\\right)-1\\right\\ } + f(\\rho_1,t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 with @xmath28 an arbitrary weight function .",
    "although this assumption seems restrictive , it is true for some important models including the flory - huggins theory of length - polydisperse polymer solutions and blends @xcite .",
    "the models for which the excess part of the free energy depends on the density @xmath23 through a finite set of moments of this distribution , for which eq .",
    "( [ energy0 ] ) is a particular example , are usually termed _",
    "truncatable _ models .",
    "polydispersity typically appears in the process of chemical manufacture of the particles of the system , so that the relative proportion of particles with different @xmath1 is fixed thereafter .",
    "the actual density of each species then depends on how much solvent is present .",
    "we define a parent distribution @xmath29 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a normalized distribution ( fixed by the initial preparation of the system ) and @xmath32 is the overall density of particles , which varies as one moves along a ` dilution line ' through the phase diagram .",
    "all other moments of the parent are fixed by @xmath32 ; for example , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is fixed at synthesis via the parent : @xmath35    although the parent distribution is globally fixed , the system can separate into coexisting phases with a distribution @xmath23 that is locally different from @xmath29 .",
    "if there are two such phases @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with respective distributions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the parent distribution is recovered as the volumetric average : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the volumes of phases @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "note however that at a phase boundary which marks the onset of phase separation , the volume fraction of the incipient ( shadow ) phase is negligible and , therefore , the @xmath1-distribution of the original ( cloud ) phase must coincide with the parent distribution .",
    "although for a given @xmath31 we require only one density ( such as @xmath0 ) , alongside temperature , to specify a point on the phase diagram , the corresponding free energy must depend on the full density distribution @xmath43 .",
    "accordingly it is not correct to substitute the parent distribution in a functional like eq .",
    "( [ energy0 ] ) to obtain a one - variable free energy @xmath44 ( or equivalently , @xmath45 ) .",
    "in fact such a substitution would describe a case where the normalized distribution @xmath31 were constrained to be equal in all coexisting phases  which is not the physical situation . instead , in the case of eq .",
    "( [ energy0 ] ) , the equality of chemical potentials dictates that the @xmath1-distribution of any cloud phase ( which coexists , by definition , with an unperturbed parent ) must obey @xmath46 for an appropriate value of @xmath47 .",
    "this distribution is not proportional to the parent unless @xmath48 ( when the phases are identical ) .",
    "however , under certain conditions there is a procedure to transform the free energy functional into an effective free energy _ function_. the conditions are first that ( as in eq .",
    "( [ energy0 ] ) ) the excess free energy @xmath49 only depends on the distribution @xmath23 through a finite set of moments ( defined as in eq .  ( [ moment1 ] ) ) ; and second that we are only interested in phase boundaries ( the cloud and the shadow curves ) and the spinodals .",
    "the procedure , called the projection method @xcite , involves several steps briefly described here , and leads to a free energy function dependent only on the moments required to specify the excess free energy .",
    "first , considers the free energy    @xmath50=\\int\\!\\!d{\\sigma}\\,\\ ; \\rho(\\sigma)\\left\\{\\log\\left(\\frac{\\rho(\\sigma ) } { p(\\sigma)}\\right)-1\\right\\ } + f(\\rho_1,t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which , for our purposes , is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ energy0 ] ) , since the inclusion of the parent as a denominator in the logarithm represents a linear term ( which can be considered as a mere shift of the chemical potentials ) .",
    "but note that , for that equivalence to hold , the parent @xmath29 , including @xmath32 , must be kept fixed as the density distribution @xmath23 varies : this observation is crucial to the landau expansion developed below .",
    "the projection method follows by minimising the first ( ideal ) term of this free energy subject to the constraint of fixed values for the moment(s ) upon which the excess free energy depends .",
    "( the only such moment is @xmath0 in our case . )",
    "this yields    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the lagrange multiplier used to constrain the minimization , determined by @xmath0 through @xmath53 since both the parent phase ( the cloud ) and the coexisting phase ( the shadow , eq .",
    "( [ coexistdf ] ) ) obey eq .",
    "( [ projdist ] ) for different values of @xmath52 , the method contains no approximation when it comes to finding the phase boundaries . however , if the @xmath1-distribution of any of the phases adopts a form different from ( [ projdist ] ) , the method produces only approximate results .",
    "this occurs whenever the system separates into finite volumes of more than one phase , that is , everywhere _ within _ the cloud curve .",
    "( in eq .",
    "( [ tieline ] ) , the projection method is inexact when @xmath54 and @xmath55 are both nonzero . )",
    "the free energy obtained by this method is @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 this free energy depends on only one density variable , since both @xmath52 and @xmath58 are given by @xmath0 .",
    "the coexisting phases are obtained from this free energy _ function _ via the common tangent method , as in the monodisperse case .      as mentioned above",
    ", the projected free energy requires knowledge of the parent distribution function @xmath29 , whose normalization @xmath32 varies as one moves along a dilution line on the phase diagram .",
    "for this reason , the projected free energy @xmath59 depends parametrically on @xmath32 , through @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; see eqs.([rho1 ] ) and ( [ rho0 ] ) , respectively .",
    "this dependence is parametric because , in the process of calculating the coexistence between phases , @xmath32 must remain fixed , so as to maintain the equivalence of eq .",
    "( [ energy0 ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "suppose that , for fixed @xmath32 and @xmath3 , we obtain by this method a coexistence between phases @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with moment densities @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "this determines the value of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 through eqs .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) and ( [ rho0 ] ) which , in turn , determines the density distribution of the two phases @xmath38 and @xmath39 via eq .",
    "( [ projdist ] ) . in general ,",
    "neither of these distributions is the parent distribution .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the parent distribution does not coexist with a second phase for arbitrary combinations of @xmath32 and @xmath3 ; this happens only on the cloud curve . to find the cloud curve , we combine the coexistence conditions derived above with the equation of the dilution line , so that one of the coexisting phases ( @xmath36 say ) is the parent distribution ; this implies that @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 ) .",
    "the critical point of the polydisperse system lies at the intersection of the cloud and shadow curves and is , therefore , correctly described ( given eq .",
    "( [ energy0 ] ) ) by the projected free energy . the equations to determine it are analogous to those of the monodisperse case , @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    "where @xmath10 means evaluated at the critical point @xmath75 .",
    "note that these two equations have three unknowns , namely @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and must be complemented by the dilution line constraint , @xmath79 .",
    "the projected free energy @xmath80 can now be expanded about the critical point ,    @xmath81    where @xmath82 . as before , the constant and linear terms have been dismissed .",
    "now we must expand the coefficients of this expansion around the critical values not only of @xmath3 , as we did in the monodisperse case , but also of @xmath32 .",
    "one might think that , after doing this , the free energy could be written , to the lowest order , as @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "if so , the term in brackets should be of order @xmath85 to balance the term of order @xmath86 .",
    "however , the second term in the brackets is actually linear in @xmath87 , as dictated by the dilution line @xmath88 .",
    "these two facts can only be obeyed if the first term in the brackets behaves like @xmath89 ( instead of @xmath90 , as in the monodisperse case ) .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that , generically , the critical point is no longer at the top of the coexistence curve .",
    "therefore , to maintain consistently the order of the approximation , the correct lowest order expansion of the free energy must contain all terms of order @xmath86 :    @xmath91{\\delta\\rho}^2   + \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{1}{3!}\\left [ \\left.\\frac{\\partial^ 4f}{\\partial\\rho_1 ^ 3\\partial t } \\right|_{c }   \\!\\delta t + \\left.\\frac{\\partial^ 4f}{\\partial\\rho_1 ^ 3\\partial p_0 } \\right|_{c }   \\!\\delta p_0 \\right]{\\delta\\rho}^3 + \\nonumber \\\\",

    "( [ rho1 ] ) and ( [ rho0 ] ) .",
    "these functions depend on @xmath0 and @xmath32 and , indeed , they obey :    @xmath94    and @xmath95    very importantly , these equations imply that the derivatives of any ( generalised ) moment with respect to @xmath0 gives rise to functions of moments ( eq .",
    "( [ proprho1 ] ) ) , and the derivatives of any moment with respect to @xmath32 must vanish in the monodisperse limit ( as does eq .",
    "( [ proprho2 ] ) ) .    with these definitions ,",
    "we can write the second derivative of the free energy , from which all the coefficients of the expansion ( [ energy4 ] ) can be obtained , as :    @xmath96    now note that , since @xmath3 and @xmath32 appear in disjunct parts of the free energy ( as in the original free energy , eq .",
    "( [ energy2 ] ) ) , all crossed terms must vanish :    @xmath97    accordingly , the coefficients of the expansion can be divided into three different groups : those including only derivatives with respect to @xmath0 , those including derivatives with respect to @xmath3 , and those including derivatives with respect to @xmath32 . while the first group of coefficients originates from the full free energy , the second originates from the excess part of the free energy ( ` the interactions ' ) , and the third group arises from the ideal part of the free energy ( ` the entropy ' ) .",
    "these three groups of coefficients have a distinct dependence on polydispersity .",
    "in particular , all the coefficients stemming from the ideal part ( those multiplying any power of @xmath98 ) must vanish in the monodisperse limit @xcite , hence recovering the ordinary landau expansion , eq .",

    ", the correct lowest order expansion of the free energy , retaining all terms to fourth order in density , is therefore @xmath100 where the coefficients of terms involving @xmath101 ( those with odd indices : @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) only depend on derivatives of the excess free energy @xmath49 , and the coefficients of terms involving @xmath98 ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) stem solely from the ideal entropy term of the system and not the interactions .",
    "the latter vanish in the monodisperse limit ; for example , @xmath108 where @xmath109 are generalized moments of the ( normalized ) parent distribution , @xmath110 which do not depend on any thermodynamic variable .",
    "it is interesting to point out here that the ultimate reason why the critical point is not on the top of the cloud curve is that the squared term of the free energy expansion at the critical point behaves effectively as @xmath111 instead of the usual @xmath112 .",
    "we stress that although the coefficients @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are small for narrow polydispersities , the expansion ( [ energy6 ] ) is asymptotically exact around the critical point for arbitrary ( not necessarily narrow ) polydisperse distributions .",

    "( [ projdist ] ) , neither of which is in general the parent distribution function @xmath29 . in order to obtain the appropriate cloud curve",
    ", we must therefore impose the dilution line constraint , @xmath117 , which leads to the following expression for the cloud curve :    @xmath118    where the slope of the cloud curve at the critical point is given by @xmath119 and its curvature by @xmath120 -\\frac{a_4}{a_1\\,n_1 ^ 2}-\\frac{a_2 ^ 2\\,a_3}{a_1 ^ 3\\,n_1 ^ 2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 as predicted ( preceding eq .",

    "given the increased complexity of the phase behavior ( separation of cloud and shadow curves ; critical point not at the maximum of these ; finite width coexistence region on the @xmath165 plot collapsing to a line in the monodisperse limit ) , we find this somewhat remarkable .",
    "we emphasize that every term in eq .",
    "( [ energy6 ] ) must be retained to achieve this degree of consistency  and in particular to reproduce the correct curvature of the cloud ; to get the curvature of the shadow also correct , one needs as well the higher terms in eq .",
    "( [ energy8 ] ) .",
    "the latter were included in the figure although leaving them out gives a result that , for this example , is only slightly less accurate .",
    "despite all the extra complexity , the region of the phase diagram within which the landau expansion could tolerably be used to replace the full calculation is similar to the monodisperse case .",
    "within the one - moment form of the excess free energy represented by eq .",
    "( [ energy0 ] ) , we have derived a generalized landau expansion , eqs .",
    "( [ energy6],[energy8 ] ) , from which the characteristic features of polydisperse binary fluid coexistence can all be shown to follow .",
    "this landau expansion was compared with direct calculation from the underlying ( mean - field ) free energy in a specific example ( figures 1 and 2 ) with excellent agreement near the critical point and qualitative agreement away from it .",
    "note that truncation of the landau expansion at the quartic order ( eq.[energy6 ] ) may prove adequate for qualitative purposes if the curvature of the shadow is not important .",
    "our expansion is correct around the critical point for arbitrary polydispersity , be it broad or narrow .",
    "the monodisperse limit is recovered by decreasing the polydispersity . in a pressure - temperature representation",
    "this limit is highly singular : for example the slope of the perimeter of the coexistence region at the critical point will converge , as the monodisperse limit is taken , to a negative value  even though the coexistence line ( onto which the region itself collapses in this limit ) has positive slope everywhere !",
    "this behavior is easily understood from figure 2 , and the landau expansion seems to have no difficulty dealing with it .    the perturbation series in density that underlies the landau expansion contrasts with , and is complementary to , a previous perturbative approach that was developed for the limit of narrow polydisperse distributions @xcite .",
    "the latter approach always breaks down close enough to the critical point ( even within mean field theory , to which , unlike our work , it is not limited in principle ) .",
    "finally , we note that although our landau expansion was derived within the specific context of eq .",
    "( [ energy0 ] ) , the generic features of the phase diagram that it reproduces are seen rather generally in experiments and other theoretical models .",
    "we have not attempted explicit calculation for the case where more than one moment is present in the excess free energy , but since the topology of the phase diagram ( near the fluid - fluid critical point ) is already captured by eq .",
    "( [ energy0 ] ) , it is possible that any such refinements will not alter the basic structure of these results .",
    "a firm conclusion on this point is , however , left to future work .",
