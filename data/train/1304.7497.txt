    "discontinuous petrov - galerkin ( dpg ) methods were introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the dpg methods minimize a residual norm , so they belong to the class of least - squares galerkin methods  @xcite , although the functional setting in dpg methods is nonstandard . in this paper , we introduce an arbitrary parameter @xmath0 into the definition of the norm in which the residual is minimized .",
    "we study the properties of the resulting family of dpg methods when applied to the helmholtz equation .",
    "the dpg framework has already been applied to the helmholtz equation in  @xcite .",
    "an error analysis with optimal error estimates was presented there .",
    "there are two major differences in the content of this paper and  @xcite .",
    "the first is the introduction of the above mentioned parameter , @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath2 , the method here reduces to that in  @xcite .",
    "the use of such scaling parameters was already advocated in  @xcite based on numerical experience . in this paper",
    ", we shall provide a theoretical basis for its use .",
    "the second major difference with  @xcite is that in this contribution we perform a dispersion analysis of the dpg method with the  @xmath1 scaling .",
    "we thus discover several important properties of the method as @xmath1 is varied .",
    "least - squares galerkin methods are popular methods in scientific computation  @xcite .",
    "they yield hermitian positive definite systems , notwithstanding the indefiniteness of the underlying problem .",
    "hence they are attractive from the point of view of solver design and many works have focused on this subject  @xcite . however , as we shall shortly see in detail , for wave propagation problems , they yield solutions with heavy artificial dissipation . since the dpg method is of the least - squares type , it also suffers from this problem .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to show that by means of the @xmath1-scaling , we can rectify this problem to some extent .    to explain this issue further ,",
    "let us fix the specific boundary value problem we shall consider .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the helmholtz wave operator defined by @xmath4 here @xmath5 denotes the imaginary unit , @xmath6 is the wavenumber , and @xmath7 is a bounded open connected domain with lipschitz boundary .",
    "all function spaces in this paper are over the complex field @xmath8 .",
    "the helmholtz equation takes the form @xmath9 for some @xmath10 .",
    "although , we consider a general @xmath11 in this paper , in typical applications , @xmath12 with @xmath13 , in which case , eliminating the vector component @xmath14 , we recover the usual second order form of the helmholtz equation , @xmath15 this must be supplemented with boundary conditions .",
    "the dpg method for the case of the impedance boundary conditions @xmath16 on @xmath17 was discussed in  @xcite , but other boundary conditions are equally well admissible . in the present work ,",
    "we consider the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath18 to deal with this boundary condition , we will need the space @xmath19 thus , our boundary value problem reads as follows : @xmath20 it is well known  @xcite that except for @xmath21 in @xmath22 , an isolated countable set of real values , this problem has a unique solution .",
    "we assume henceforth that @xmath21 is not in @xmath22 .    before studying the dpg method for  , it is instructive to examine the simpler @xmath23 least - squares galerkin method",
    ". set @xmath24 to the cartesian product of the lowest order raviart - thomas and lagrange spaces , together with the boundary condition in @xmath25 .",
    "the method finds @xmath26 such that @xmath27 throughout , @xmath28 denotes the @xmath29 norm , or the natural norm in the cartesian product of several @xmath29 component spaces .",
    "the method   belongs to the so - called fosls  @xcite class of methods .",
    "although   appears at first sight to be a reasonable method , computations yield solutions with artificial dissipation .",
    "for example , suppose we use  , appropriately modified to include nonhomogeneous boundary conditions , to approximate a plane wave propagating at angle @xmath30 in the unit square .",
    "a comparison between the real parts of the exact solution ( in figure  [ fig : dissip - exact ] ) and the computed solution ( in figure  [ fig : dissip - ls ] ) shows that the computed solution dissipates at interior mesh points .",
    "the same behavior is observed for the lowest order dpg method with @xmath2 in figure  [ fig : dissip - dpg1 ] ( see  [ ssec : inexact ] for the definition of @xmath31 therein and section  [ sec : stencil ] for a full discussion of the lowest order dpg method ) .",
    "the same method with @xmath32 however gave a solution ( in figure  [ fig : dissip - dpg1e-6 ] ) that is visually indistinguishable from the exact solution .",
    "note that , for the dpg method with @xmath2 , the numerical results presented in  @xcite show much better performance , because slightly higher order spaces were used there . instead , in this paper , we have chosen to study the dpg method with the lowest possible order of approximation spaces to reveal the essential difficulties with minimal computational effort .    0.45     ( about sixteen elements per wavelength ) .",
    "artificial dissipation is visible in figures  [ fig : dissip - ls ] and  [ fig : dissip - dpg1 ] . ]",
    "0.45     ( about sixteen elements per wavelength ) .",
    "artificial dissipation is visible in figures  [ fig : dissip - ls ] and  [ fig : dissip - dpg1 ] .",
    "]    0.45     ( about sixteen elements per wavelength ) .",
    "artificial dissipation is visible in figures  [ fig : dissip - ls ] and  [ fig : dissip - dpg1 ] .",
    "]    0.45     ( about sixteen elements per wavelength ) .",
    "artificial dissipation is visible in figures  [ fig : dissip - ls ] and  [ fig : dissip - dpg1 ] . ]",
    "the situation in figures  [ fig : dissip - ls ] and  [ fig : dissip - dpg1 ] improves when more elements per wavelength are used .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the asymptotic error estimates of the methods . to give an example of such an error estimate , consider the case of the impedance boundary conditions considered in  @xcite .",
    "it is proven there that there is a constant @xmath33 , independent of @xmath6 and mesh size @xmath34 , such that the lowest order dpg solution @xmath35 satisfies @xmath36 for a plane wave solution .",
    "a critical ingredient in this analysis is the estimate @xmath37 which , as shown in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemmas  4.2 and 4.3 ) , holds for all @xmath38 in the analogue of @xmath25 with impedance boundary conditions .",
    "although the analysis in  @xcite was for the impedance boundary condition , similar techniques apply to the dirichlet boundary condition as well , leading to  .",
    "as more elements per wavelength are used , @xmath39 decreases , so   guarantees that the situation in figure  [ fig : dissip - dpg1 ] will improve .",
    "the analysis for the @xmath23 least - squares method is easier than the above - mentioned dpg analysis . indeed , by  , @xmath40 for any @xmath41 .",
    "hence , applying   to the error @xmath42 and noting that the residual is @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath44 . by standard approximation estimates , we then conclude that there is a @xmath33 independent of @xmath6 and @xmath34 such that @xmath45 this simple technique of analysis of @xmath23-based least - squares methods is well - known ( see  e.g. , @xcite ) . as with",
    ", the estimate   implies that as the number of elements per wavelength is increased , @xmath39 decreases , and the situation in figure  [ fig : dissip - ls ] must improve .",
    "yet , figures  [ fig : dissip - ls ] and  [ fig : dissip - dpg1 ] show that these methods fail to be competitive with standard methods in accuracy for small number of elements per wavelength",
    ". the figures also illustrate one of the difficulties with asymptotic error estimates like   and  . having little knowledge of the size of @xmath46",
    ", we can not predict the performance of the method on coarse meshes .",
    "motivated by this difficulty , one of the theorems we present ( theorem  [ thm : eps ] ) will give a better idea of the constant involved as @xmath47 . also note that the above indicated error analyses does not give us a quantitative measure of differences in wave speeds between the computed and exact waves .",
    "this motivates the dispersion analysis we present in this paper , which will address the issue of wave speed discrepancies .",
    "we should note that there are alternative methods of the least - squares type that exhibit better performance than the standard @xmath23-based least squares method .",
    "some are based on adding further terms to the residual to be minimized ( e.g. , to control the curl of the vector equation  @xcite ) .",
    "another avenue explored by others , and closer to the subject of this paper , is the idea of minimizing the residual in a dual norm  @xcite .",
    "the main difference with our method is that our dual norms are locally computable in contrast to their nonlocal norms .",
    "this is achieved by using an ultraweak variational setting .",
    "the domain and codomain of the operator in the least - squares minimization associated to the dpg method are nonstandard , as we shall see next .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the method for the helmholtz equation introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we then show exactly where the parameter @xmath1 is introduced to get the variant of the method that we intend to study .",
    "let @xmath48 be a disjoint partitioning of @xmath7 into open elements @xmath49 such that @xmath50 .",
    "the shape of the mesh elements in @xmath48 is unimportant for now , except that we require their boundaries @xmath51 to be lipschitz so that traces make sense .",
    "let @xmath52 where @xmath53 let @xmath54 be defined in the same way as @xmath55 in  , except the derivatives are taken element by element , i.e. , on each @xmath56 , we have @xmath57      the following basic formula that we shall use is obtained simply by integrating by parts each of the derivatives involved : @xmath58 for smooth functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 and domains @xmath61 with lipschitz boundary . above ,",
    "overlines denote complex conjugations and the integrals use the appropriate lebesgue measure .",
    "note that we use the notation @xmath62 throughout to generically denote the outward unit normal on various domains  the specific domain will be clear from context  e.g. , in  , it is @xmath61 . introducing the following abbreviated notations for tuples @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 we can rewrite  , applied element by element , as @xmath66 by density , holds for all @xmath67 and all @xmath68 .",
    "then , @xmath69 must be interpreted using the appropriate duality pairing as the last term in   contains interelement traces on @xmath70 .",
    "it will be convenient to introduce notation for such traces : define @xmath71 as follows . for any @xmath72 ,",
    "the restriction of @xmath73 on the boundary of any mesh element @xmath51 takes the form @xmath74 although the meaning of @xmath75 is more or less self - evident , to include a proper definition , first let @xmath76 denote the space of all functions of the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is in @xmath79 , normed by @xmath80 let @xmath81 denote the dual space of @xmath76 .",
    "now , consider the map @xmath82 , defined for smooth functions @xmath83 on @xmath84 . since @xmath85 ( the left and right hand sides extend to duality pairings in @xmath76 and @xmath79 , respectively ) , the standard trace theory implies that @xmath86 can be extended to a continuous linear operator @xmath87 .",
    "the range of @xmath86 is what we denoted by `` @xmath88 . '' throughout this paper , functions in @xmath75 appear together with a dot product with @xmath62 , so we could equally well consider the standard space @xmath89 , but the notation simplifies with the former .",

    "our results show that pollution errors are present in all the three methods considered in figure  [ fig : cgcecomp ] .",
    "the difference in convergence rates , e.g. , whether @xmath349 converges to zero at the rate @xmath350 or at the rate @xmath351 becomes important , for example , when trying to answer the following question : what @xmath34 should we use to obtain a fixed error bound for @xmath352 for all frequencies @xmath21 ? while methods with convergence rate @xmath353 would require @xmath354 , methods with convergence rate",

    "our results for the case of @xmath337 are collected in figure  [ fig : bands ] . to discuss these results ,",
    "let us first recall the behavior of the standard bilinear finite element method ( whose discrete wavenumbers are also plotted in dash - dotted curve in figure  [ fig : bands ] ) . from its well - known dispersion relation (",
    "see e.g ,  @xcite ) , we observe that if @xmath359 solves the dispersion relation , then @xmath360 also solves it .",
    "accordingly , the plot in figure  [ fig : realband ] is symmetric about the horizontal line at height @xmath361 .",
    "furthermore , as already shown in  @xcite , @xmath359 is real - valued in the range @xmath362 .",

    "we observed a somewhat similar behavior for the dpg method  see the solid curves of figure  [ fig : bands ] , which were obtained after calculating @xmath339 explicitly using the computer algebra package maple , for the lowest order dpg method , setting @xmath219 and @xmath367 .",
    "the major difference between the dpg and fem results is that @xmath359 from the dpg method was not real - valued even in the regime where fem wavenumbers were real .",
    "it seems difficult to define any useful analogue of the cut - off frequency in this situation .",
    "nonetheless , we observe from figures  [ fig : realband ] and  [ fig : imagband ] that there is a segment of constant real part of value @xmath361 , before which the imaginary part of @xmath359 is relatively small . as",
    "the number of mesh elements per wavelength increases ( i.e. , as @xmath39 becomes smaller ) , the imaginary part of @xmath359 becomes small .",
    "we therefore expect the diffusive errors in the dpg method to be small when @xmath39 is small .",
    "finally , we also conclude from figure  [ fig : bands ] that both the dispersive and dissipative errors are better behaved for the dpg method when compared to the @xmath23 least - squares method .",
    "we presented and analyzed the @xmath1-dpg method for the helmholtz equation .",
    "the case @xmath2 was analyzed previously in  @xcite .",
    "the numerical results in  @xcite showed that in a comparison of the ratio of @xmath23 norms of the discretization error to the best approximation error is compared , the dpg method had superior properties .",
    "the pollution errors reported in  @xcite for a higher order dpg method were so small that its growth could not be determined conclusively there . in this paper , by performing a dispersion analysis on the dpg method for the lowest possible order , we found that the method has pollution errors that asymptotically grow with @xmath6 at the same rate as other comparable methods .",
    "in addition , we found both dispersive and dissipative type of errors in the lowest order dpg method .",
    "the dissipative errors manifest in computed solutions as artificial damping of wave amplitudes ( e.g. , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : dissip ] ) .",
    "our results show that the dpg solutions have higher accuracy than an @xmath23-based least - squares method with a stencil of identical size .",
    "however , the errors in the ( lowest order ) dpg method did not compare favorably with a standard ( higher order ) finite element method having a stencil of the same size .",
    "whether this disadvantage can be offset by the other advantages of the dpg methods ( such as the regularizing effect of @xmath1 , and the fact that it yields hermitian positive definite linear systems and good gradient approximations ) remains to be investigated .",
    "we provided the first theoretical justification for considering the @xmath1-modified dpg method .",
    "if the test space were exactly computed , then theorem  [ thm : eps ] shows that the errors in numerical fluxes and traces will improve as @xmath47 .",
    "however , if the test space is inexactly computed using the enrichment degree @xmath31 , then the numerical results from the dispersion analysis showed that errors continually decreased as @xmath1 was decreased only for odd @xmath31 . a full theoretical explanation of such discrete effects and the limiting behavior when @xmath1 is @xmath326 deserves further study ."
