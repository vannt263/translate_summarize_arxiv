    "the total energy is obtained by summing over @xmath6 , and the hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of @xmath116 as @xmath123 as described in the main text , @xmath23 is determined by the diagonal elements of the projection operator @xmath124 where @xmath125 stands for the moore - penrose pseudo - inverse , see sect .",

    "@xmath125 is simply the inverse .    in order to proceed ,",
    "there are two distinct cases to examine :    a.   @xmath126 are linearly independent ( and hence @xmath85 ) .",
    "b.   @xmath126 are linearly dependent .    case ( i ) is relatively simple . in this case",
    "the rank of @xmath72 is @xmath67 , and so is the rank of @xmath79 . since @xmath79 is a projection operator in an @xmath67-dimensional space ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath79 must be the identity operator , and thus @xmath84",
    ".    it might be useful to explicitly construct the transformation matrix @xmath35 that shows how this happens . by the rank - nullity theorem",
    "we know that there are @xmath127 vectors @xmath128 ( `` goldstone modes '' ) which satisfy @xmath129 and do not have an energetic cost .",
    "the @xmath67 rows of @xmath116 together with the @xmath127 goldstone modes form a basis , i.e. the new variables take the form @xmath130 with    @xmath131    in these terms , the energy takes the form @xmath132 with this at hand it is immediate to see that @xmath133 since @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "we thus conclude case ( i ) with the following outcome : whenever the interactions ( either @xmath136 or @xmath117 ) are linearly independent , all of the local energies are equal , @xmath84 , irrespective of any other property of the interactions .",
    "the total energy of the system is then @xmath137 , which amounts to assigning @xmath0 to every non - goldstone mode .",
    "case ( ii ) is more involved in the sense that it is difficult to make further progress without substantially constraining the structure of the interactions .",
    "as will be shown , in order for the result to remain valid ( at least in the thermodynamic limit ) the number of interactions must not greatly exceed the number of dof .",
    "this is always the case in one - dimensional systems with short range interactions , as we now show .    in the following we consider a one - dimensional systems with local interactions of the form @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the interaction length .",

    ", we iteratively make use of the sherman - morrison formula @xcite which can be put in the form @xmath151 and is valid whenever both @xmath14 and @xmath53 are invertible ( here @xmath54 is a vector and @xmath55 is a scalar ) . to calculate the inverse of @xmath42 , as given in eq .",

    "in fact , in the relatively simple case discussed here , a closed form recursive expression can be obtained , reading @xmath159 , with @xmath160 as can be readily verified by explicit calculation .",
    "thus , the number of non - zero elements of @xmath161 scales with @xmath26 ( as opposed to @xmath117 , for which this number is exactly @xmath87 ) .",

    "<S> we further show that in one - dimensional systems with short - range interactions , the thermal energy is equally partitioned even for coupled degrees of freedom in the thermodynamic limit and that in higher dimensions non - trivial spatial distributions emerge . </S>",
    "<S> some implications are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> equilibrium thermal fluctuations play a key role in physics , chemistry and biology , and the framework that captures their properties  statistical thermodynamics  is a central branch of physics . </S>",
    "<S> one of the renowned results obtained in this field is the equipartition theorem @xcite , which in its simplest form states that the total thermal energy of the system is equally distributed among its uncoupled degrees of freedom ( dof ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , each uncoupled dof appearing quadratically in the hamiltonian has on average an energy of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath3 is the absolute temperature  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> it is intriguing , though , to ask in all generality whether the average potential energy of coupled dof can significantly deviate from the value predicted by equipartition . </S>",
    "<S> put simply , we ask : what can be said in general about the spatial distribution of thermal energy ? to the best of our knowledge , despite its basic nature and generality , this question has not been posed in the literature , nor answered .    </S>",
    "<S> one may speculate that a localized enhancement or inhibition of thermal energy may have some effect on various local processes . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if local thermal fluctuations activate chemical reactions , these might be facilitated or hindered in the presence of enhanced or reduced fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> other processes which might be affected are structural changes , such as severing of biopolymers  @xcite . related effects may also be observed in elastic - network models of protein folding , where local ( nearest - neighbor ) fluctuations are assumed to dictate bond rupture  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that while much attention has been devoted to the effect of disorder on non - equilibrium transport properties , e.g.  @xcite , to the best of our knowledge none of the previous works explored the equilibrium spatial distribution of thermal energy , as we intend to do here .     </S>",

    "<S> its potential energy is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy of the @xmath7-th spring and the @xmath8 s denote the deviation of the @xmath4-th particle from its equilibrium position ( when possible , we adopt the convention that latin indices denote dof , while greek indices denote interactions ) . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the rest length of the entire chain is identical to the distance between the bounding walls . as is typical in such systems , the kinetic energy , @xmath9 , is a sum of quadratic uncoupled terms . </S>",
    "<S> thus , diagonalizing the kinetic contribution is trivial , and hence in what follows we disregard the kinetic energy of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> what is the average energy stored in the @xmath7-th spring ? in particular , can it significantly deviate from the value predicted by equipartition ? </S>",
    "<S> for such a simple system the answer is readily calculable through the correlations between the @xmath8 s . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes thermal averaging . </S>",
    "<S> since the energy is quadratic , the correlation matrix @xmath13 is given in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath14 by  @xcite @xmath15 where the the hamiltonian ( or the hessian ) is defined as @xmath16 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath18 \\ .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq : epsilon_springs}\\ ] ]    a few insights can be gained from this very simple example . </S>",
    "<S> first , a clear cut answer is given to the question presented above : for a general choice of the @xmath19 s , the _ thermally averaged _ energy of a given spring may differ from the value predicted by equal partition . </S>",
    "<S> second , since the system consists of two dof ( i.e. the hamiltonian has two normal modes ) , each contributes @xmath1 to the total energy , and thus @xmath20 , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the _ spatial average _ of the energy agrees , by construction , with the equipartition theorem , and reads @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> third , we note that @xmath23 is bounded between 0 and @xmath1 , which means that inhomogeneity in the @xmath19 s might either increase or decrease it relative to the spatially average value of @xmath24 , depending on the inhomogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we note that for a homogeneous system , i.e. @xmath25 , the energy is obviously equally partitioned among the springs and equals @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> these results might appear somewhat restricted as they involve a system with a small number of dof , @xmath22 , and involve specific boundary conditions which may play a non - trivial role , especially in a small system . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we next aim at understanding how the spatial distribution of thermal energy depends on the number of dof , @xmath26 , and on the boundary conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> we first consider a system of @xmath26 dof @xmath27 and @xmath28 springs . </S>",
    "<S> the potential energy is @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath6 is the potential energy of the @xmath7-th spring and the @xmath19 s are non - negative constants . </S>",
    "<S> formally , eq .   makes reference to @xmath31 or @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> these are not real dof , but rather `` boundary conditions '' imposed by the fixed walls and should be taken as @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the general question that we pose is : what can be stated about the distribution of  @xmath23 , for general @xmath19 s ?    the conventional procedure for addressing such a question is to diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath14 and work in the basis of its normal modes . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath23 can be reconstructed , at least conceptually , by summing over the contributions of the individual modes ( e.g. eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> while this generic recipe is very useful in most cases , in this case working with the normal modes obfuscates the structure of the problem , since there is no simple way to describe them for a general distribution of the @xmath19 s .    what is then a useful basis to work with ? </S>",
    "<S> to answer this question we first note that for _ any _ linear change of variables @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an invertible @xmath36 matrix , the modified hamiltonian takes the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 stands for @xmath39 ( note that this is not a similarity transformation , as @xmath35 is not orthogonal ) . </S>",
    "<S> straightforward matrix manipulations show that even for the non - orthogonal variables @xmath40 the correlation matrix is given by the inverse of the relevant hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath41 . the main insight gained from this brief discussion is that one should not be constrained to using an orthogonal basis in transforming the hamiltonian into a desired form . </S>",
    "<S> this turns out to be important for solving the problem at hand .    following this insight </S>",
    "<S> , we look for new variables @xmath34 such that @xmath42 will be , loosely speaking , `` almost '' diagonal . a clue for finding a useful basis </S>",
    "<S> is obtained by inspecting eq . </S>",
    "<S> , which is _ already _ written in an `` almost '' diagonal form , if we identify the new variables simply as @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we take the combinations that make up the interactions as the new variables . </S>",
    "<S> this defines the transformation matrix @xmath44 .    under this choice of non - orthogonal variables , </S>",
    "<S> almost all of the spring energies in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> become @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the last relation , however , is valid only for @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , a one - to - one correspondence between the dof and the interactions / springs is impossible since the number of springs exceeds @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , an explicit calculation shows that in terms of the new variables the energy is not strictly decoupled , but only almost @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a vector of @xmath50 s .    </S>",
    "<S> equation is very useful since the inverse @xmath51 is readily calculated using the sherman - morrison formula  @xcite , which can be expressed in the form @xmath52 and is valid whenever both @xmath14 and @xmath53 are invertible ( here @xmath54 is a vector and @xmath55 is a scalar ) . applying this formula to eq .  </S>",

    "<S> two features of this result will prove important . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is seen that @xmath58 regardless of the choice of @xmath19 s ( moreover , the order in which the @xmath19 s are distributed in space makes no difference , @xmath23 depends only on @xmath59 and the average @xmath60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , it is evident that @xmath23 tends towards @xmath1 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath61 , as long as @xmath62 does not increase with @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> our next task is to generalize eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> it will be shown that these two features are general for a wide class of physical systems , namely systems with local interactions undergoing gaussian fluctuations around a stress - free equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show , for these systems @xmath63 is a _ strict upper bound _ for @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is entirely general , independent of dimensionality or interaction range . </S>",
    "<S> second , the fact that @xmath64 plus a negative correction of order @xmath65 , which depends on the inhomogeneity , is the general rule for one - dimensional systems with short - range interactions . in particular , in such systems the distribution of thermal energy becomes _ spatially constant _ in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> these are two main results of this work .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a system with @xmath26 dof and total energy @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the most general expansion of @xmath6 in the dof reads @xmath68 the linear term vanishes under thermal averaging as long as anharmonic contributions to the energy are neglected , and hence is omitted hereafter ( note that @xmath69 vanishes due to global equilibrium ) . </S>",
    "<S> the only assumption we adopt is that @xmath70 can be written as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is an @xmath73 matrix which describes the interactions in the system ( for example , @xmath72 can be easily read off eq .  ) . in this case , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> this is a generic form of local interaction energies for a broad class of physical systems : ( i ) discrete field theories , or discrete approximations to continuum field theories , where the energy density takes the form @xmath75 ^ 2 $ ] , with some spatial linear differential operator @xmath76 and field @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> relevant examples include  among many others  the euler - bernoulli theory of elastic beams @xcite , the fppl von - krmn theory of thin sheets  @xcite and the helfrich theory of membrane elasticity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) systems of discrete particles interacting via a radially - symmetric pairwise potential , where at equilibrium all particle pairs are at a stress - free configuration . </S>",
    "<S> relevant examples include glassy systems near jamming  @xcite and elastic networks  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath23 can be readily expressed in terms of the interaction matrix  @xmath72 , as @xmath78 @xmath79 is an orthogonal projection operator @xcite , since @xmath80 ( this holds even when @xmath81 is not invertible  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a general property of such operators is that all their elements are smaller than unity in absolute value . </S>",
    "<S> we thus prove a central result of this work , i.e.  that @xmath82    the rank of @xmath79 , which equals that of @xmath14 and @xmath72 , carries important information . </S>",
    "<S> for example , since @xmath79 is a projection operator that works in a space of dimension @xmath67 , in case that @xmath83 we can immediately conclude that @xmath79 is the identity and thus @xmath84 identically . </S>",
    "<S> this happens whenever the rows of the interaction matrix @xmath72 are linearly independent ( and in particular @xmath85 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath86 , for nearest - neighbor interactions , corresponds to isostatic systems , i.e. systems where the number of constraints ( interactions ) equals the number of dof  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> equation puts strict bounds on the possible values of @xmath23 , but much more can be said about the behavior within these bounds . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we can derive the analog of eq .   in the general case of one - dimensional systems with short range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed derivation can be found in  @xcite , and it follows verbatim the structure of the derivation of eq .  , as outlined here : for one - dimensional systems , where each dof interacts with its @xmath87 nearest neighbors the number of interactions generally exceeds the number of dof by @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> a non - orthogonal transformation is used to bring the hamiltonian to the form @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is diagonal and the second term is a sum over the @xmath87 `` excess '' interactions . </S>",
    "<S> then , the sherman - morrison formula is iteratively applied @xmath87 times to calculate the inverse . because of the short - range nature of the interactions , the magnitude of the non - diagonal correction to @xmath51 is of order @xmath90 , and vanishes in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> this is another central result of this work : in one - dimensional systems with short range interactions , the spatial distribution of thermal energy becomes essentially flat in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> the crux of the argument lies in the fact that the number of interactions does not greatly exceeds the number of dof , and that the ratio between them approaches unity in the the thermodynamic limit .    </S>",
    "<S> returning to the problem of the spring - mass chain , and having solved the problem of the @xmath26-dependence for fixed boundary conditions , we now turn to explore the effect of boundary conditions for a fixed @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , semi - fixed boundary conditions can be obtained by removing the constraint of one of the walls , by setting , say , @xmath92 . in doing </S>",
    "<S> so we obtain @xmath93 independent interactions and thus @xmath94 is _ identically constant _ for _ any _ @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> fully free boundary conditions are obtained by setting both @xmath95 and @xmath96 to zero , and give rise to a single goldstone mode ( uniform translation ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath97 independent interactions and again @xmath23 is identically constant ( clearly , both these results can also be obtained by properly taking limits of eq .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> this also shows that in one - dimensional systems the effect of boundary conditions in non - local , i.e. every spring in the system is affected by the bounding walls .    the general approach discussed above </S>",
    "<S> can be applied to different types of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , bending fluctuations are described by local interactions of the form @xmath98 , where the @xmath99 s are the local bending rigidities . </S>",
    "<S> identical arguments show that in a chain with free boundary conditions , the spatial distribution of bending fluctuational energy is exactly constant , regardless of the choice of the @xmath99 s .    </S>",
    "<S> this result offers the first application of the theoretical development described in this paper , as it seems to refute a recently conjectured mechanism for severing of actin filaments , one of the most important and ubiquitous biopolymers in eukaryotic cells @xcite . in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it has been hypothesized that thermal energy may be concentrated at the boundaries between relatively softer and stiffer regions of the biopolymer ( softening is induced by a different molecule , cofilin , which partially binds actin  @xcite ) , and that the excess thermal energy is responsible for the experimentally observed preferential severing near these boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> our result shows , at least within the framework of a discrete description of quadratic bending fluctuations , that no such energy concentration takes place .    what happens in higher dimensions ? </S>",
    "<S> as the crux of the argument lies in the relative number of dof and interactions , dimensionality appears to be crucial . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in dimensions higher than one the argument seems to fail qualitatively as generally there are significantly more interactions than dof . in this case , we also expect local topological variations , bond strength disorder , defects , holes , free boundaries and the like to play a role .    to see this , consider a hexagonal portion of a two - dimensional triangular lattice of @xmath100 particles ( which amounts to @xmath26 dof ) , interacting via linear springs , as shown in the inset fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2d ] . clearly , in the limit of large systems the number of springs @xmath67 approaches @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> when all of the springs are identical , i.e. with no bond strength disorder , we expect the average energy of a spring far from the free boundary to approach @xmath102 ( this was verified by an explicit calculation ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is no reason , however , to expect the thermal energy to be spatially uniform in the presence of inhomogeneities , either in the lattice topology or in the bond strength .    to test this , we considered the lattice in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2d ] with bond strength disorder , where the @xmath19 s are normally distributed  , where @xmath103 are normally distributed , and @xmath104 is a small cutoff that has little influence on the results . ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 is plotted vs. @xmath19 in the main panel , where the average energy of bulk springs in a homogeneous system , @xmath24 , is shown as well . </S>",
    "<S> bulk and boundary springs are distinguished . </S>",
    "<S> several key observations can be made : ( i ) unlike in one - dimensional systems , thermal energy spans the whole interval between @xmath105 and @xmath1 , both below and above the homogeneous system bulk value , @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) @xmath23 appears to vary systematically with the local spring strength @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) boundary springs have higher energy than bulk springs . </S>",
    "<S> this is a purely topological effect in which boundary springs have less neighbors than bulk springs , an effect that persists near free boundaries in fully ordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> in general , disordered systems ( e.g. glassy ones @xcite ) feature also bulk topological disorder .     </S>",
    "<S> ( in units of @xmath106 ) as a function of @xmath107 , for a hexagonal portion of a two - dimensional triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the data are partitioned into bulk ( blue ) and boundary springs ( yellow ) , cf . </S>",
    "<S> inset . </S>",
    "<S> spring constants are distributed normally with mean @xmath50 and variance @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> each side of the hexagon consists of @xmath109 springs , which means @xmath110 ( a smaller system , with @xmath111 springs and @xmath112 , is shown in the inset for illustration ) . </S>",
    "<S> no quantitative change was observed with increasing @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the points show data from @xmath113 realizations and the solid lines are guides to the eye . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line shows the asymptotic value @xmath114 , corresponding to @xmath23 in the bulk of a homogeneous triangular lattice in the thermodynamic limit . ]    in summary , in this work we posed a basic question in statistical physics : what is the spatial distribution of thermal energy in equilibrium ? </S>",
    "<S> we showed that under the stated conditions it is strictly bounded between @xmath105 and @xmath63 , and that for one - dimensional systems with short - range interactions , the spatial distribution of thermal energy becomes essentially flat in thermodynamic limit , even for highly disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> the crux of the derivation lies in the fact that in one - dimensional systems the number of interactions is the same as the number of dof , up to an additive constant which is negligible in the thermodynamic limit . in higher dimensions </S>",
    "<S> this does not hold , as was explicitly demonstrated in a specific example . systematically unraveling the relations between the spatial energy distribution and dimensionality , </S>",
    "<S> the system s geometry and the form of disorder is a theoretical challenge for future work .    </S>",
    "<S> the most outstanding question that emerges from this work is what the influence of the spatial distribution of thermal energy on various physical processes and quantities might be . </S>",
    "<S> if local energy fluctuations can affect local process , as was suggested  for example  in the context of bond rupture in elastic - network models of protein folding  @xcite , then one can imagine the possibility of tailoring high dimensional systems in order to enhance or reduce thermal fluctuations in defined locations , to control local processes of interest . </S>",
    "<S> another important future direction would be to explore the roles played by stresses ( both internal and external ) .    </S>",
