    "the aharon - vaidman game @xcite is a conceptually simple example of how quantum mechanics can be both beneficial and counter - intuitive . in the classical analog ,",
    "alice puts a particle in one of three boxes such that when bob , who in next turn is allowed to check only two of them , is most likely to find it .",
    "alice who can either accept or not accept a particular game trial wins whenever she accepts a trial in which bob has also discovered the particle .",
    "hence , it is obvious that alice will not use the box that bob does not have access to and therefore her chance to win is @xmath0 .",
    "however , the result of the game can be totally different when the particle is described by laws of quantum mechanics and alice prepares it in equal superposition of being in each of the boxes .",
    "then her chance to win can reach @xmath1 if she takes a specific projective measurement after bob s turn .    in this article we present an experimental realization of the av quantum game using a single photon as the incident particle and a system of three slits in lieu of the boxes .",
    "the original three box paradox was proposed by aharonov and vaidman in ref .",
    "the quantum game @xcite was conceived much later and exhibits a clear quantum advantage if the game rules are followed with care .",
    "the setup comprising of a single photon source ( heralded parametric down conversion source or attenuated laser ) , triple slit @xcite and single photon detectors allowed us to perform optimized quantum tomography to characterize the qutrit states and to play the game correctly in the next step . some quantum communication protocols that can be considered as quantum games such ascoin tossing @xcite and the byzantine agreement @xcite",
    "have been demonstrated previously",
    ". however , the av game is a specific example of a quantum game where one can demonstrate the quantum advantage playing the game with a single particle at a time in contrast to the entanglement based games @xcite .",
    "we will begin with the introduction of the concept of the qutrit encoded in spatial degrees of freedom of a single photon @xcite . in the next step",
    "we discuss the av quantum game @xcite and its experimental implementation .",
    "presented implementation of the game is conceptually similar to the young experiment , where multilevel quantum systems can be encoded in paths related to a photon passing through the slits . recently",
    "this type of quantum state encoding has drawn much interest .",
    "in particular , taguchi _ et .",
    "used parametric down conversion source to prepare two qubit @xcite and two qutrit @xcite states . in turn ,",
    "lima _ et .  al .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the seven and eight dimensional state encoding .",
    "alternative approaches resort to state encoding in various hybrid ways such as energy - time @xcite or polarization - orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "those implementations were useful to perform a bell test for energy - time entangled qutrits @xcite and to demonstrate the optimal cloning strategy @xcite , respectively .",
    "more recently , the noncontextuality of quantum mechanics was tested based on similar scheme @xcite .",
    "the young type qutrit is realized using triple slits and a single photon source(sps ) .",
    "the photon s initial spatial mode is gaussian with the characteristic diameter much larger than the size of the slits and with the peak intensity coincident with the slit area , see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] . under these conditions",
    "one can consider the state of a photon of wavelength @xmath2 in the position @xmath3 to be a plane wave @xmath4 propagating in direction given by the wave vector @xmath5 of length @xmath6 .",
    "moreover the photon s initial propagation direction is assumed to be paraxial and the distance between the slits larger than their characteristics widths .",
    "this allows us to approximate the phase to be constant at each of the slit .",
    "hence , the spatial wave function of the photon passing through the @xmath7th slit can be written as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 stands for the transmission probability amplitude , which we assume is constant on the slit and @xmath11 elsewhere .",
    "this means that the total wave function of the photon passing through three slits comprises of three orthogonal contributions .",
    "each of them can be written in momentum representation as @xcite : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the slit width and @xmath15 is the distance between the slits .",
    "these definitions allow us to write the state of the transmitted photon as : @xmath16 which accounts for the basic definition of a young type qutrit .",
    "here amplitudes @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 depend on the transmission functions @xmath10 .",
    "the projective measurements are determined by the laws of propagation and the geometry of the setup . for simplicity",
    ", we chose to detect in the positions corresponding to near and far field .",
    "this can be done using a lens and placing a detector in the focal plane ( far field ) and in the plane where the image of the slits is formed ( near field ) . in the near field , if the active area of the detector is larger than the image of each slit , the probability to detect a photon prepared in the state @xmath20 as defined above in the position corresponding to @xmath7th slit image is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "hence it is easy to see that each of the three positions can be associated with the measurement operator defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the normalization factor to be specified later and subscript nf stands for near field .",
    "the interpretation of measurements in the far field needs more attention . a detection in the position @xmath24 in the focal plane corresponds to the projector onto @xmath25 , which is related to the plane wave propagating in the direction given by the transverse wave vector @xmath26 .",
    "hence the probability to detect a photon @xmath27 can be seen as proportional to @xmath28 , where we introduced @xmath29 .",
    "based on this observation we can define the measurement operator in the far field as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the normalization factor , the phase parameter reads as @xmath32 and the subscript ff stands for far field .    the measurement operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be used to construct rank 7 positive value operator measure ( povm ) set allowing one for reconstruction of arbitrary pure state . for this reason",
    "we take three near field measurements @xmath35 , @xmath9 and six far field operators @xmath36 corresponding to @xmath37 .",
    "this specific choice requires renormalization , which can be done when @xmath38 .",
    "nm ) , laser power controller ( lpc ) and neutral filter ( nf ) .",
    "the pdc - sps ( @xmath39  nm ) is based on ppktp crystal pumped by blue continuous wave laser .",
    "heralding photon is detected by detector d3 .",
    "the single photons from both sources are coupled to single mode fibers ( smf ) .",
    "a qutrit is prepared using the blocking mask and three slits .",
    "next the measurement part of the setup comprises of a 2 inch diameter @xmath40 mm lens ( l3 ) , 2 inch diameter pellicle beamsplitter ( bs ) , color filters ( f ) and two detection systems for far ( d1 ) and near filed ( d2 ) , each comprised of multimode fiber mounted on a precise motorized stage ( thorlabs zst13 ) and a perkin elemer avalanche photodiode . ]",
    "the ability to encode and measure qutrit states can be utilized to demonstrate aharon and vaidman s quantum game @xcite .",
    "a classical strategy allows alice for at most @xmath0 chance to win . on the other hand , when she uses quantum particles her chance rises above this limit and ideally reaches @xmath1 , when she chooses her initial state to be @xmath41 in the first turn of the game . in the second turn",
    ", assuming bob has access to slits ( boxes ) @xmath11 and @xmath42 , if he decides to check if the photon is passing though slit number @xmath11 , he does a projective measurement on the state @xmath43 .",
    "if he finds the particle , then his state becomes @xmath44 , otherwise @xmath45 .",
    "the photon detection results in losing the photon from the system , otherwise the photon goes through opened slits .",
    "this can be simulated by blocking slit number 0 , which will allow us to simulate all those cases when bob s detector did not click . on the other hand ,",
    "the case of finding a photon in slit number 0 can be simulated by closing all others .",
    "next , in the third turn of the game alice makes a projective measurement on @xmath46 .",
    "this can be done by placing the detector d1 in the far field plane in the position corresponding to povm element @xmath47 .",
    "if alice detects a particle , she accepts the game trial , and if she does not , she cancels it .",
    "now it is clear that alice can not lose as whenever bob does not detect a photon , the state after the second turn is @xmath48 and alice s detector never clicks as @xmath49 . if bob found the particle in a slit @xmath11 and tried to leave no trace of that , alice has @xmath50 chance to detect it after that .",
    "the same reasoning holds if bob chooses the slit number @xmath42 .",
    "the experimental setup is depicted in fig .  [ fig : experiment ] .",
    "we used two single photon sources : heralded parametric downconversion ( pdc ) source based on periodically polled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) crystal ( pdc - sps ) and attenuated hene laser ( al - sps ) . in order to fulfill the assumption of the plane wave incidence at the slits we used single mode fibers ( smfs ) and optics to set the characteristic spatial mode diameter to approximately   @xmath51 mm .",
    "we control the state of the qutrit using blocking mask ( b ) to change the configuration of opened slits and tilting slightly the mirror ( m ) to change the incidence angle @xmath52 . under these simplifying assumptions",
    "the experimentally possible states are in the following form @xmath53 .",
    "the far and near field measurements were implemented by photon counting in the transverse planes at distances of @xmath54 and @xmath55 mm , respectively .",
    "large @xmath42 inch pellicle beamsplitter ( bs ) was introduced to reduce the disturbance of the setup while changing the planes of detection .",
    "each detector system ( d1,d2 ) was comprised of a multimode fiber mounted on precise motorized stage and perkin elemer avalanche photodiode .",
    "step motors were used to control the transverse position of the fiber with an accuracy of @xmath56 m .",
    "counts were registered by the field programmable gate array ( fpga ) logic system .    before simulating the av game and characterizing prepared states",
    "the setup was calibrated .",
    "it was done by opening all slits and setting the initial direction of photon propagation to @xmath57 , which corresponded to preparing the state @xmath58 .",
    "next we measured the photon count rates as a function of the detector position in far- and near - field planes .",
    "the results together with the best fits are presented as insets in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] .",
    "blue ( online ) dots represent experimental data , while the continuous line is a theoretical fit .",
    "the positions corresponding to the far-(near- ) field part of povm are marked with bigger red dots on inset next to detector d1(d2 ) .",
    "note that the smoothed shape of the slits image ( near field ) is attributed to the finite size of a detector .    .",
    "photon count probabilities were measured in the positions related to projective measurements @xmath34 and @xmath33 for three typical states @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we characterized the prepared qutrit , which has been done resorting to povm set described earlier and quantum state tomography methods . for this reason",
    "the photon counts were measured by placing detectors in positions related to measurements operators @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "those positions are marked with red dots on inset plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] . in order to justify the results of the quantum game we took three typical states : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "for the first state all slits were open , for the second one a slit number 0 was closed and for the last state the propagation direction of the photon was modified in order to introduce a phase @xmath65 .",
    "these measurements were done using al - sps , its outcomes are gathered in table [ tab : counts ] and the results of tomographic reconstruction using the maximal likelihood method are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : density](a , b ) that for the states @xmath66 and @xmath67 the real part dominates as there is no phase present . on the other hand",

    "[ fig : density](c ) as the imaginary bars are significant . ideally , the imaginary part of the density matrix for states @xmath66 and @xmath67 is zero . here",

    "[ fig : density](a ) .",
    "we simulated all possible scenarios of bob s measurement using pdc - sps and al - sps .",
    "the measured photon counts are presented in table as an inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : qg ] . in the perfect case one expects no counts when two slits are open and alice sets her detector in the far field plane in the position related to @xmath47 .",
    "this corresponds to the first local maximum marked with red dot on plot related to far field inserted in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] . here , the measured counts are attributed to the finite size of the multimode fiber core , dark counts and stray light .",
    "we estimate that the former two contribute approximately 3 coincidence counts per 2 seconds . despite the background noise from",
    "stray light and dark counts , and the slight non - ideal properties of alice s measurements , she won in 87% of the accepted trials using pdc - sps and in 82% of the accepted trials using al - sps .",
    "note that the overall efficiency of the game , which is due to experimental deficiencies including the photon collection , the detection efficiencies and number of alice s detectors , will only limit the number of accepted trials , but not the percentage of winning trials .",

    "in conclusion , we experimentally presented a simple way to implement a qutrit system into a single photon s spatial degree of freedom , which allowed us to perform state tomography and simulate the av quantum game .",
    "the encoding part resorted to the young type experiment , where a photon passes through 3 slits , which defined its state . by controlling an initial propagation direction of a photon and configuration of the slits it was possible to encode a certain class of states .",
