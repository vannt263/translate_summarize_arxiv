    "although it has now been well established that gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) are of cosmological origin , their nature and source still remains a mystery .",
    "detailed observations and studies of their afterglow emission have revealed important information regarding the dynamic features and environments of these explosive events ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the detection of supernova light curve in the afterglows of long duration nearby grb has indicated that a fraction of the grb occur during the the collapse of a massive star ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "other mechanism that could produce grb are the merger of compact objects like a pair of neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus grb may be a heterogeneous group and a proper classification of the phenomena is crucial to isolate and identify the possible different sources . such a classification will also enable the identification of spectral or temporal correlations which may exist only for a particular class of grb .",
    "in general , grb have been classified into two groups of long ( @xmath2 sec ) and short ( @xmath3 sec ) duration bursts .",
    "this is based on visual inspection of the distribution of burst duration which clearly shows two peaks .",
    "theoretically , this may be understood by identifying long bursts with collapsing stars where the duration of the event is linked to the dynamical collapse time - scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the merger of two neutron stars should occur on short timescales and hence may correspond to the short duration bursts . in this scenario ,",
    "the long duration bursts should always be associated with a supernova explosion and occur in star burst regions , while short bursts should have no relation to star burst regions and should have no associated supernova",
    ". however , theoretically another mechanism to create a grb could be the merger of neutron stars with white dwarfs",
    ". these would be long duration bursts , with no associated supernova and could be a significant fraction of the total observed bursts @xcite .",
    "observationally , there have been some evidence that there may be more than two classes of grb .",
    "some grb have been recorded with low intrinsic luminosity and do not comply with standard spectral relationships @xcite .",
    "more compelling evidence was the absence of a super - nova light curve in two nearby bursts , grb 060614 and 060505 , which suggested that not all long duration bursts are due to massive stellar collapses @xcite , although for grb 060614 this result has been disputed by @xcite , who claim that this grb is not a nearby one . while confirmation of these results are awaited , they do highlight the need to examine the possibility that there are more than two types of grb .",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) has provided spectral and temporal information for more than 1500 grb . although batse provides several spectral parameters , the bimodal distribution of grb is based on univariate analysis i.e. only duration is considered as a parameter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is a claim that even such a univariate analysis supports the existence of three classes @xcite .",
    "classification analysis taking into account more observed parameters , i.e. a multivariate analysis , was first undertaken by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , different type of analysis were undertaken to classify grb .",
    "@xcite used a neural network technique while @xcite have undertaken a factor analysis .",
    "nonparametric hierarchical clustering techniques have been used by @xcite for 797 grb with six variables and by @xcite for 1599 grb with nine variables .",
    "the results were confirmed for the complete batse grb catalog @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a unsupervised pattern recognition algorithm while @xcite have classified grb by fitting bivariate distributions to the observed duration and hardness ratios . in all these cases ,",
    "the authors have claimed the existence of at least three classes of grb although it is not clear whether the different classifications found are consistent with each other , primarily because of the different techniques and the choice of different observed parameters and data sets .",
    "these analyses are based on the observed properties of the grb and are hence subject to observational biases .",
    "@xcite argue that such classification techniques are significantly hampered and the three classes found is probably due to such biases ( see @xcite for a counter argument ) .",
    "indeed , a proper classification should be based on intrinsic rather than observed properties",
    ". however since the number of grb with known red - shift and uniformly measured temporal and spectral parameters is small , such an exercise is presently not possible .",
    "although it can be argued that certain correlations between observed parameters ( e.g. the positive correlation between duration and flux ) can not be entirely due to observational bias , it is difficult to ascertain whether the quantitative relationships are not affected .",
    "a prudent approach may be to treat such classification as indicative of the nature of systems which should be corroborated by theoretical expectations and further observations .",
    "since theoretical expectations are on intrinsic properties , there is a need to estimate how these intrinsic properties cluster , given the results of a classification based on observed ones .",
    "the classification itself should be tested for robustness using different types of schemes .",
    "the result of such an analysis may guide or be supported by theoretical models .",
    "moreover , the results can lay down the broad framework and requirements of future observations which can confirm or rule out the proposed theoretical scenario .    in this work ,",
    "we use two different multivariate clustering techniques , the k - means partitioning method and the dirichlet process of mixture modeling , to classify grb based on their observed properties .",
    "these two schemes , which have not been used before for grb , have the advantage that they do not follow any prior assumption about the number of homogeneous classes .",
    "the optimum classification comes out of the process itself .",
    "the two schemes allow for post classification discriminant analysis which can be used to verify the acceptability of the classification by computing classification / misclassification probabilities .",
    "more importantly , a grb which is not in the original sample and which has only a subset of the observed properties used for the classification can be assigned a probability for it to be a member of a certain class .",
    "thus although our analysis has been based on the batse catalog , grb with known red - shifts ( which have been observed by other instruments ) can be assigned such probabilities and suitably classified . as we shall see , this not only provides qualitative estimation of any possible observational bias , but can constrain the intrinsic properties of the different clusters .",
    "we have selected 21 grb with known redshifts and well constrained spectral parameters for such classifications and obtained constrains on the cluster s average luminosity .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the two classification schemes and present the result of the analysis on the batse catalog . in  3 , the classification obtained from the batse data",
    "are used to classify grb with known red - shifts and inferences are made on the intrinsic properties of the different grb groups . in ",
    "4 the work is summarized and the main results are discussed .",
    "the batse catalog provides temporal and spectral information for more than 1500 grb .",
    "the parameters include , two measures of burst durations , the times within which 50% ( @xmath4 ) and 90% ( @xmath5 ) of the flux arrive , three peak fluxes , @xmath6 measured in 64 , 256 and 1024 ms bins respectively , four time integrated fluences @xmath7 , in the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 kev spectral channels .",
    "many of the parameters are highly correlated and following previous works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we use the following six parameter set : log@xmath4 , log@xmath5 , log@xmath12 , log@xmath13 , log@xmath14 , log@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the total fluence while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are measures of spectral hardness .",
    "the sample consists of @xmath19 grb that have non - zero detections of these parameters .",
    "we have not introduced any completeness criteria ( like a lower flux cutoff ) , since incompleteness primarily affects the short duration bursts and hence is not expected to change the qualitative results obtained .",
    "we retain the @xmath20 flux ( in the definition of @xmath13 ) , despite the uncertainties in its calibration and sensitivity , because as we discuss later in  4 , the @xmath21-ray flux @xmath22 kev is expected to have important spectral information .",
    "however , this fluence is not used in the computation of spectral hardness .      over the last several decades",
    ", different algorithms have been developed for cluster analysis which is used to find groups in a multivariate data set .",
    "the choice of a clustering algorithm depends both on the type of data available and on the particular purpose .",
    "generally , clustering algorithms can be divided into two principal types viz . partitioning and hierarchical methods . a partitioning method constructs",
    "k clusters i.e. it classifies the data into k groups which together satisfy the requirement of a partition such that each group must contain at least one object and each object must belong to exactly one group .",
    "so there are at most as many groups as there are objects ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "two different clusters can not have any object in common and the k groups together add up to the full data set .",
    "the aim is usually to uncover a structure that is already present in the data .",
    "on the other hand , hierarchical algorithms do not construct single partition with k clusters but they deal with all values of k in the same run .",
    "the extreme partitions with @xmath24 ( all objects are together in one cluster)and @xmath25 ( where each object forms a separate cluster ) is a part of the output . in between all values of @xmath26",
    "are covered in a kind of gradual transition .",
    "the only difference between @xmath27 & @xmath28 is that one of the r clusters splits in order to obtain @xmath29 clusters or two of the @xmath30 clusters combined to yield @xmath31 clusters . in this method",
    "either one starts with @xmath32 and move hierarchically downwards where at each step two clusters are merged depending on similarity until only one is left i.e. @xmath24 ( agglomerative ) or the reverse way where one starts with @xmath24 and moves upwards where at each step one cluster is divided into two ( depending on dissimilarity ) until @xmath32 ( divisive ) .",
    "most of the previous works on grb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been based on hierarchical clustering .",
    "however , for grb classification , a partitioning method may be more applicable because ( a ) it tries to select the best clustering with k groups which is not the goal of a hierarchical method , ( b ) a hierarchical method can never repair what was done in previous steps and ( c ) partitioning methods are designed to group items rather than variables into a collection of k clusters .    in this work ,",
    "we apply the k- means method of @xcite which is probably the most widely technique , to the batse catalog . for this method",
    ", the optimum value of k can be obtained in different ways @xcite .",
    "this is done by computing for each cluster formation ( i.e for number of clusters @xmath33 ) a distance measure @xmath34 $ ] which is defined as the distance of the @xmath35 vector ( values of the parameters ) from the center of a cluster @xmath36 ( which is estimated as mean value ) .",
    "@xmath37 is the order of the @xmath35 vector , i.e. the number of parameters which for our case is six .",
    "if @xmath38 is the estimate of @xmath39 at the @xmath40 point , then @xmath38 is the minimum achievable distortion associated with fitting k centers to the data .",
    "a natural way of choosing the number of clusters is to plot @xmath38 versus k and look for the resulting distortion curve .",
    "this curve will monotonically decrease with increasing k , till k is greater than true number of clusters , after which the curve will level off with a smaller slope .",
    "this is expected since adding more clusters beyond the true number , will simply create partitions within a group . according to @xcite it is more illustrative to consider the transformation of the distortion curve to an appropriate negative power , @xmath41 ) , which will exhibit a sharp `` jump '' when k equals the true number of clusters .",
    "the optimum number of clusters is the value of k at which the distortion curve levels off as well as its value associated with the largest jump for the transformed curve .     and the transformed jump curve @xmath42 for different number of clusters .",
    "the largest value of @xmath42 and the leveling of @xmath38 indicates that for the k - means clustering technique the optimal number of clusters is three .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    fig [ f1 ] shows the distortion curve and transformed jump curve for the analysis of the batse data .",
    "the leveling of the distortion curve and the shape of the jump function strongly suggests that the optimum number of clusters is greater than two and is likely to be three .",
    "the group means and the standard errors for the six parameters for three cluster classification , are tabulated in table [ t1 ] .",
    "cluster i with 423 members has an average @xmath43 s can be clearly identified with the short duration bursts .",
    "the long duration bursts are cleanly separated into two clusters ( clusters 2 and 3 ) with 622 and 549 members .",

    "these two schemes do not make any a priori assumptions about the number of clusters , but instead provide quantitative estimate of the optimal number of groups .",
    "the jump curve for the k - means partitioning method suggests that this optimal number is three which is further supported with the value of the expected number of clusters , @xmath109 , obtained using dirichlet process of mixture modeling .",
    "the two techniques group the grbs in qualitatively similar classes , which can be described as short bursts ( @xmath142 s , cluster i ) , long duration , low fluence bursts ( @xmath129 ergs/@xmath46 , cluster ii ) and long duration , high fluence bursts ( @xmath135 ergs/@xmath46 , cluster iii ) .    to estimate how such a classification , based on observed spectral and temporal parameters , can arise from intrinsic grb properties , a sample of 21 grb with known red - shifts and well constrained spectral parameters ,",
    "are classified within this scheme .",
    "the observed total fluence , @xmath13 and duration @xmath5 for these grbs if they were located at different red - shifts ( @xmath124 ) were estimated . for 16 of the 21 grb",
    ", the estimated fluence would have satisfied @xmath135 ergs/@xmath46 for nearly the entire range of red - shift space and hence they were classified as high fluence bursts .",
    "this invariance in red - shift , indicates that the classification scheme is not strongly effected by observational bias and by the use of observed parameters instead of intrinsic ones . for five grb , classified as low fluence bursts ,",
    "the predicted fluence @xmath129 for a significant fraction of the red - shift space , which again signifies the physical nature of the classification .",
    "based on the classification of these grb with known red - shift , it can be inferred that the low fluence grb have a nearly constant isotropic energy output of @xmath0 ergs and have an intrinsic ( red - shift corrected ) duration of @xmath143-@xmath144 secs . on the other hand , the high fluence grb ( cluster iii )",
    "have a much wider range of isotropic energy output @xmath139 ergs and a corresponding wide range of intrinsic durations @xmath145 - @xmath146 secs .",
    "we note with caution that the number of grb with known red - shifts , used for this analysis is small and a much larger sample is required before concrete conclusions can be drawn .",
    "it is also important , for this analysis , to have well constrained spectral parameters of these grb . in particular , the peak of the energy fluxes , @xmath126 are required to be well estimated and since for high energetic sources @xmath147 kev , it is imperative to have well calibrated high energy information . indeed , if the highest energy channel of the batse measurement is not taken into account , the significance of the classification is smaller .",
    "the classification presented here , needs to be supported by theoretical considerations .",
    "it is tempting to identify the low fluence grb with neutron star - white dwarf mergers @xcite and the higher fluences ones with massive stellar collapse .",
    "the near constancy of the isotropic energy output of low fluence bursts , seem to be consistent with them being neutron star - white dwarf mergers . since both neutron stars and white dwarfs do not have significant mass variations , their initial conditions for",
    "the binary merger could be similar , leading to the nearly constant energy output .",
    "moreover , their merger time may also be typically smaller than massive stellar collapse time - scales , which is consistent with the shorter intrinsic duration @xmath148 s , found in this work .",
    "on the other hand , the energy output and duration of grb induced by massive stellar collapse may depend on the mass and size of the progenitor which is consistent with the variation inferred for high fluence bursts .",
    "the present observational evidence for such a model is not clear .",
    "evidence for supernova light curves have been detected in grb with different energy output , including some low luminosity ones , e.g. grb 0311203 , @xmath149 ergs @xcite , the nearby grb 060614 , for which no supernova was detected also had a low isotropic energy output of @xmath150 ergs .",
    "such low energy output are not represented in the 21 grb with well constrained spectral parameters used in this analysis which all have energies @xmath151 ergs .",
    "these rare grb ( since they have to be located relatively nearby to be detected ) may not represent a significant fraction of the batse catalogue .",
    "batse did detect grb 980425 which is at low redshift ( @xmath152 ) and is associated with a supernova . at this redshift , the grb would be a borderline case between the high and low fluence grb ( figure 2 ) .",
    "thus the interpretation of the two different classes of long bursts as being due to stellar collapse and white dwarf - neutron star mergers , is speculative and more quantitative theoretical predictions and observational evidences are required before a definite conclusion can be made ."
