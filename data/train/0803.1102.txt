    "the existence of entanglement in a composite system implies strong correlations between its parts ; so strong that no classical model can explain them .",
    "when classical correlations become strong in a condensed matter system , i.e. when they stretch over large distances , a new ` phase ' emerges which manifests in qualitatively different behaviour of the material .",
    "phase transitions happen when a parameter , such as the temperature , reaches a critical value . in this paper",
    "we will determine the _ critical temperature _ below which entanglement is present and at which a quantum - correlated phase emerges in the harmonic lattice .",
    "the entanglement properties of the bisected one - dimensional harmonic chain have been analysed in @xcite using extensive mathematical formalism to discuss the ground state ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the authors also provide a remark on the situation for thermal states , however , the treatment there is rather short . in the present paper",
    "we illuminate the thermal case in greater detail by first discussing two - site entanglement and then any entanglement for finite size chains as well as in the thermodynamic limit , for varying external potential and in one , two and three dimensions .",
    "our intention is to gain intuition about the physics behind the quantum - classical transition at @xmath0 .",
    "we explain how the excitation and mixing of the phononic modes degrades the entanglement unless the lattice is in the intrinsically ` quantum phase ' below @xmath0 where quantum zero - point fluctuations dominate .",
    "we find that entanglement depends on external parameters as well as size and propose that manipulating these will enable techniques of tuning and swapping entanglement in trapped ions .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ] the harmonic lattice model is introduced and we summarise technical methods that build the fundament for the results discussed later .",
    "readers familiar with these techniques may skip to section [ sec : analytical ] where we derive analytical expressions for the entanglement of the one - dimensional harmonic chain in the thermodynamic limit and at zero temperature , and then approximate the critical temperature for nearest neighbour entanglement . in section [ sec : e4tandn ]",
    "we present comprehensive numerical results for two - site entanglement in the one - dimensional chain .",
    "the value of the respective critical temperatures is explained and finite chain sizes are discussed . in section [ sec : del+d ] we investigate the dependence of the nearest neighbour entanglement in the one - dimensional chain when increasing an external trapping potential .",
    "finally , this behaviour is compared with the behaviour of entanglement in the two- and three - dimensional lattice .    in section [ sec :",
    "e = ew ] a different approach to detect entanglement is taken . using the energy as a witness for any entanglement ( not just between two sites ) we derive the minimal energy bound for completely separable thermal states .",
    "we then establish the critical temperature for witnessed entanglement for the physical sites and find that it is independent of the dimension of the lattice .",
    "in section [ sec : phasedia ] we show and compare the two temperature thresholds derived in the present paper with the threshold for block - entanglement found in @xcite and the threshold for full separability derived in @xcite in a comprehensive entanglement phase diagram .",

    "even though non - nearest neighbours do not interact directly , common nearest neighbours could mediate entanglement .",
    "we find that this is _ not _ the case when the chain size grows arbitrarily , as both @xmath67 and @xmath68 remain positive for @xmath69 .",
    "however , for finite chain sizes , the above calculation is only an approximation and the numerical results show small entanglement between next nearest neighbours for very small chains at low temperatures , see section [ sec : e4tandn ] for discussion . to conclude , at zero temperature and in the thermodynamic limit of large @xmath1 two - site entanglement only exists between nearest neighbours and not between any further separated sites .",
    "this result agrees with @xcite , where the authors showed that in gapped harmonic lattice systems the correlation functions decay exponentially in the ground state and thermal states .      when the temperature rises , thermal mixing becomes stronger and correlations between the nearest neighbours decrease .",
    "we expect intuitively that any entanglement should vanish at large enough temperatures .",
    "the transition into the classical regime is marked by a critical temperature which we here want to approximate .",
    "the exact temperature for various parameter ranges can be found numerically and is discussed in sections [ sec : e4tandn ] and [ sec : del+d ] .",
    "again we take the continuum limit @xmath60 and replace the sums by integrals in eq.([eq : separability ] ) . assuming that the trapping potential vanishes , @xmath62 , we obtain @xmath70 the integrals have no closed expression and we need to further approximate the @xmath71-function to evaluate @xmath52 . the coupling parameter @xmath72 , where @xmath3 is the finite interaction strength between neighbours , is temperature dependent . assuming high temperatures , @xmath73",

    "[ fig : nne+nnne ] over the temperature and for varying size of a one - dimensional chain .",
    "we observe that in general the entanglement is highest for low temperatures and decreases sharply with increasing @xmath82 until it vanishes abruptly at some critical temperature .",
    "for nearest neighbours the critical temperature decreases for increasing @xmath1 and converges to @xmath88 in the thermodynamical limit , which agrees with the analytical result in eq.([eq : tnn ] ) .",

    "next - nearest neighbour entanglement ( dashed curves ) is in general much smaller than the nearest neighbour entanglement .",
    "nonetheless , the numerical data show that a small amount of entanglement exists between next - nearest neighbours when the chain is very small . however , the entanglement as well as the critical temperature are considerably lower than for nearest neighbours and decrease rapidly to zero for increasing @xmath1",
    ".      we can understand the behaviour of entanglement with changing temperature in the following way . without quantum zero - point fluctuations ,",
    "the ions in the chain would be completely fixed and entanglement would stretch over all sites at zero temperature .",
    "however , due to the fluctuation of the phononic modes of the chain ( # of phononic modes is @xmath1 with @xmath60 ) correlations are mixed with anti - correlations and the entanglement in the chain reduces considerably . for nearest neighbours the mixing of vibrations is biased .",
    "this is a result of the direct coupling between them leading to an average deviation of the ions from equilibrium position of less than the harmonic oscillator length of the interaction .",
    "indeed for small temperatures entanglement exists between nearest neighbours , see the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : nne+nnne ] .",
    "next - nearest neighbours and more distant sites do not have a bias of the phononic modes in the thermodynamic limit and entanglement between them is averaged out even at @xmath89 .",
    "however , when the chain size is small , finite size effects occur .",
    "so few phononic modes are available that the different swinging motions of the ions are not completely balanced and some correlations survive .",
    "this is why we find next - nearest neighbour entanglement for very small lattices , see the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : nne+nnne ] .",
    "it is also the reason why the entanglement between nearest neighbours is in general slightly higher for smaller lattices , as can be seen for the solid set of curves where the uppermost curve displays the behaviour of a tiny chain with @xmath91 , and the lower curves apply for increasing @xmath1 .",
    "when the temperature is raised , more phonons are excited and the mixing of different vibrations is enhanced .",
    "this leads to a rapid decay of the entanglement and when the temperature reaches the magnitude of the phononic modes that drive nearest neighbours against each other the entanglement vanishes completely .",
    "this happens when the two degrees of freedom , the position and the momentum of each of the @xmath1 ions , with classical thermal energy @xmath92 per degree of freedom exceeds the energy of the quantum fluctuations of each of the @xmath1 springs that connect nearest neighbours , @xmath93 ( for @xmath94 ) .",

    "notable is that this entanglement is more robust and survives increasingly high temperature mixing .",
    "for example , when @xmath106 , the critical temperature has increased to @xmath107 .",
    "when the trapping potential @xmath2 is raised close to and above @xmath3 two effects emerge .",

    "the higher the dimension the lower is the ground state entanglement , but the higher rises the critical temperature .",
    "the reason behind this behaviour is the growing fixation of the ions to their sites for increasing dimension .",
    "namely , in the thermodynamic limit ( and for @xmath62 ) the average displacement of the ions from their equilibrium position , @xmath113 , diverges linearly in 1d and logarithmically in 2d , while converging in 3d .",
    "no long - range order can be established in 1d and 2d as the crystal simply ` melts ' ( for a discussion see for example @xcite and references therein ) . only in three dimensions",
    "do the fluctuations of the ionic positions become smaller than the lattice spacing , long - range order can occur and a solid with a three - dimensional crystalline structure can form . to obtain the same effect",
    "one could impose a strong trapping potential to hold the ions tightly in place and thereby force crystallisation in low dimensions .",
    "thus , increasing the trapping potential is effectively raising the dimension of the lattice structure and vice versa .",
    "two - site entanglement is a very restricted kind of entanglement .",
    "other kinds of entanglement exist , for example genuine three - partite entanglement .",
    "as indicated by the previous numerical results the balance between the available thermal energy compared to the phononic spectrum determines the existence of entanglement implying that the energy may be a useful criterion as an entanglement witness .",
    "this idea has been used in a number of works before , for example in @xcite . adopting this strategy for the harmonic lattice in @xmath4 dimensions we identify the temperature range where some kind of entanglement must necessarily be present .",
    "the most general , fully separable ( into @xmath1 sites ) state is of the form @xmath114 where @xmath115 are probabilities with @xmath116 .",

    "thus the description of the lattice has become a mean - field model where each site interacts with an effective , identical background produced by the interaction with all other sites .",

    "the possible energy for a separable configuration of the whole lattice is thus bounded from below by @xmath130 any state having an energy below this bound is necessarily entangled with respect to the sites .",
    "it may seem puzzling that one could apply the same strategy for other set of modes , for instance , for the phononic modes themselves and find a non - zero energy bound .",

    ".    for example , entanglement can exist between two neighbouring _ blocks _ of @xmath171 sites .",
    "results in @xcite for @xmath176 ( this appears to be the critical value according to figure 12 in  @xcite after retaining all units ) confirm this and their critical temperature for block - entanglement , @xmath177 , is indicated in fig .",

    "the temperature at which this transition happens is given as @xmath178 ( for @xmath155 ) in @xcite .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath2 , the witness bound @xmath166 is in good agreement with the exact threshold for full separability , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the temperature range where the entanglement survives thermal mixing is identical to the regime where the quantum zero - point effects are important .",
    "the use of the energy as an entanglement witness is thus justified and in general an alternative , easier way to evaluate regions where entanglement is present , c.f .",
    "@xcite . for higher dimension",
    "we find that the critical temperature for nearest neighbour entanglement increases towards the dimension independent witness temperature ( see fig .  [ fig : alld ] ) thus leaving less temperature range where non - two - site entanglement is witnessed .",

    "bi - partite split _ of the chain into two parties such , that partial transposition on one of the parties results in a non - positive density matrix .",
    "any entanglement can thus potentially be identified by this property and the value of the negative eigenvalue can be used to measure the amount of entanglement .",
    "in condensed matter physics the two - point correlation function @xcite between two sites is an important quantity used to determine the behaviour of the material .",
    "if correlations stretch over a wide range of sites , i.e. the correlation function becomes a constant or decreases polynomially for increasing distances , then one speaks of the establishment of an ordered phase .",
    "quantum physics allows for a stronger kind of correlation , that is , entanglement .",
    "the entanglement criterion eq",
    ".   is reminiscent of the classical order criterion for the two - point correlation function .",
    "instead of requiring that the fluctuations of the ionic positions , @xmath183 , should be smaller than the lattice spacing , we here have a condition on the product of the relative positions and the relative momentum fluctuations .",
    "in other words , instead of requiring order in _ space _ the entanglement criterion requires order between two sites in _",
    "phase space_.    we have found that entanglement exists between nearest neighbours in all dimensions , for all lattice sizes , and for all values of @xmath2 , when the system is cooled below some critical temperature , which depends on the former parameters . by changing the temperature the entanglement can be modulated and even cut out .",
    "the critical temperature at which the entanglement vanishes is directly proportional to the coupling constant ; for the harmonic chain this is the coupling @xmath3 .",
    "this relation is in agreement with previous results in spin chains @xcite and bose gases @xcite where also the interaction strength determines the critical temperature .",
    "entanglement between next - nearest neighbours exists in very small lattices , but is in general much weaker in magnitude and also only observable at much lower temperatures than for the nearest neighbour case .",
    "a possible application for trapped ions in lattices with harmonic interaction , would be to tune the value of @xmath2 and @xmath82 such , that only nearest neighbour ions remain entangled . by slowly inserting an additional ion in the lattice",
    "one can destroy entanglement to the former nearest neighbours and the new nearest neighbours become entangled . varying the trapping potential @xmath2 or the interaction strength @xmath3 , one can further change the amount and range of entanglement in the lattice .",
    "such techniques and the possibility to apply additional external potentials that modify the interaction and hence affect the structure of the entanglement may allow to store and manipulate information on the ions .",
    "for instance , applying an extra harmonic potential to all ions in a small periodic chain results in a higher frequency of the lowest phononic mode , the centre of mass mode , that could influence the chain to ` swap ' entanglement from nearest neighbours to opposite ions in the ring by simply raising the temperature .    even though in the thermodynamic limit only neighbouring pairs",
    "are entangled and more distant pairs are not , we can speak of an ` entangled phase ' .",
    "this notion is justified because entanglement is much stronger than classical correlations and nearest neighbour entanglement is already sufficient to transport information across the whole lattice .",
    "such correlations enable universal quantum computation in the measurement - based model , as initiated in @xcite for spin systems with nearest neighbour interaction and its analogue for the continuous variable case proposed in @xcite .",
    "the entangled phase survives , approximately , as long as the system is in the quantum regime where the zero - point fluctuations dominate the physics of the lattice .",
    "going beyond that range implies the validity of a mean - field theory where each site can be described as an independent oscillator whose effective frequency includes the contributions from the rest of the system .",
