    "the classical two - sample problem concerning i.i.d .",
    "observations has been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "we propose in this paper to extend this problem to the case of two contaminated samples when a noise is added to each sample .",
    "more precisely , we consider two samples , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , from the following two models [ convol ] x = y+z , & and & u= v+w , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( resp . @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) are two independent random variables .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath3 and @xmath5 are independent .",
    "however this paper concerns independent as well as paired variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 since @xmath2 and @xmath4 can be dependent .",
    "we keep this hypothesis through the paper putting @xmath8 ( the more general case being easily obtained ) .",
    "we assume that all moments of @xmath3 and @xmath5 exist and are known .",
    "we are interested in testing the equality of the distribution of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "our aim is to construct an omnibus test for the general non parametric hypothesis [ hyp ] h_0 : l_y= l_v & against & h_1 : l_y_v , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 refers to the distribution of @xmath2 and @xmath4 . for that we extend the one - sample smooth test inspired of neyman ( 1937 )",
    "( see also rayner and best , 1989 , for a general introduction ) to the two - sample case under ( [ convol ] ) .",
    "for the one sample problem , the smooth test is an omnibus approach which consists in coming down to parametric hypotheses",
    ". then the smooth statistic is composed of different elements each able to detect a departure from the null hypothesis .",
    "this approach can be naturally extended to the two sample case , as in rayner and best ( 2001 ) ( see also chervoneva and iglewicz , 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , ledwina ( 1994 ) introduced a data driven procedure permitting to select automatically the number of elements of the statistic .",
    "the automatic selection is based on the schwarz ( 1978 ) criterion .",
    "janik - wrblezca and ledwina ( 2000 ) first used this technique combined with rank statistic for the two sample problem .",
    "recently ghattas et al .",
    "( 2011 ) obtained a data driven test for the two paired sample problem .",
    "various extensions of the data driven smooth test have been proposed , particularly in the context of survival data in krauss ( 2009 ) when samples are right censored , or in the context of detection of changes in antoch et al .",
    "( 2008 ) reducing the problem to a two sample subproblem .    from ( [ convol ] )",
    "it is clear that the unknown moments of @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "@xmath4 ) can be expressed in terms of moments of @xmath6 and @xmath3 ( resp . @xmath7 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the proposed smooth test is based on the difference between the @xmath11 first moments of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the order @xmath11 determines the number of components of the test statistic .",
    "we then adapt the data driven approach permitting to select automatically this number .",
    "we first consider the case where @xmath11 varies between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , for @xmath13 a fixed integer .",
    "then we let @xmath11 tend to infinity more slowly than the sample size . for asymptotic results we make an assumption on the smallest eigenvalue of the sample covariance matrix .",
    "but in practice , the data driven procedure is effective in the first case with @xmath13 fixed large enough , as shown in our simulations .",
    "finally , we apply our method to the uefa champion s league data from meintanis ( 2007 ) .    before describing our test procedure",
    "we offer a few examples that illustrate the situation ( [ convol ] ) .    _",
    "evaluation by experts_. during an assessment , such as sensory analysis , it is very common that experts are biased in their judgments .",
    "this bias is commonly observed and assessed during training and can be assumed to be known in distribution .",
    "typically , one can assume a normal distribution with mean and variance associated with each expert .",
    "in this case , if we want to compare the distribution of two products evaluated by two experts , we are reduced to the situation ( [ convol ] ) where @xmath6 and @xmath7 coincide with the two experts scoring , @xmath3 and @xmath5 being their errors .",
    "_ ruin theory .",
    "_ another situation that can be encountered in ruin theory is the random sum of claims , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with known exponential distribution .",
    "the number of claims can be decomposed into a fixed known value , @xmath16 , and a random value , @xmath17 , representing an aggregation of different claims .",
    "thus if we observe two sums x = _ i=1^n_1+n_1e_i & and & u",
    "= _ i=1^n_2+n_2v_i , where @xmath15 and @xmath18 are i.i.d .",
    ", one problem is to compare the randomness structure @xmath19 and @xmath20 , that is to test the equality of the distributions of these two variables .",
    "this problem coincides with ( [ convol ] ) since it is equivalent to testing the equality of the distributions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "_ mixture model_. the deconvolution problem is also related to a mixture problem since a particular case of ( [ convol ] ) is the location mixture situation of the form f_x(x)=f_y(x - m ) f_z(dm ) , & & f_u(x)=f_v(x - m ) f_w(dm ) , with @xmath23 the location parameter , @xmath24 , @xmath25 the unknown mixed densities and @xmath26 , @xmath27 the known mixing densities .",
    "this situation can be encountered when finite mixture distributions have known components , and when the purpose is to compare their associated sub - populations associated with these components .",
    "we can also reverse the roles of @xmath28 and @xmath29 and be interested in the comparison of two linear mixed models with gaussian noise and unknown random effects .    _",
    "extreme values_. contaminated model can be also viewed as a model for extremal values considering the convolutions x = y+z , & & u = v+w , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are bernoulli with small parameter representing the occurrence of an extreme event .",
    "often the non - extreme distributions of @xmath3 and @xmath5 are well observed and known and we can be interested in the comparison of the extreme distributions of @xmath2 and @xmath4 . assuming that one knows when these rare events occur , they are observed with a known noise as in ( [ convol ] ) .    _ scale mixture_. finally , it is current to observe the product of two variables , say x = yz , & & u = vw .",
    "for instance , that is the case for zero inflated distributions , when @xmath2 and @xmath4 are bernoulli random variables and @xmath3 and @xmath5 are discrete random variables . without loss of generality , by translating all variables , we can use a log - transformation to recover ( [ convol ] ) .",
    "many other cases can be envisaged as @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath3 and @xmath5 normally distributed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the method based on polynomial expansions for testing the equality of the two contaminated densities . in section 3 we propose a simple data driven procedure that we extend to the case where the number of components of the statistic tends to infinity , with additional assumptions . in section 4 , finite - sample properties of the proposed test statistics are examined through monte carlo simulations .",
    "the analysis of a the champion s league data set is provided in section 5 . section 6 contains a brief discussion .",
    "consider simultaneously two ( possibly paired ) samples @xmath34 and @xmath35 following ( [ convol ] ) and such that all moments exist and characterize the associated distributions .",
    "is is assumed that the moments of @xmath3 and @xmath5 are known . from ( [ convol ] )",
    "we have the following two expansions for all integer @xmath36 ( x^i ) = _",
    "j=0^i c_ij(y^j)z_i - j , & and & ( u^i ) = _",
    "j=0^i c_ije(v^j)w_i - j , [ basic ] with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "write @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the null hypothesis coincides with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and our testing procedure reduces to the parametric testing problem : @xmath44 @xmath45 , when @xmath11 gets large",
    ". we shall let @xmath11 tend to infinity , with a speed depending of the sample size , and its choice will be done automatically by a data driven method .",
    "inverting ( [ basic ] ) we get a_i= ( p_i(x ) ) & and & b_i = ( q_i(u ) ) , [ basic2 ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are polynomials of degree @xmath36 .",
    "for instance the first three terms are p_1(x ) & = & x - z_1 , + p_2(x ) & = & x^2 - 2z_1p_1(x)-z_2 , + p_3(x ) & = & x^3 -3z_1p_2(x)-3z_2p_1(x)-z_3 . to construct the test statistics we consider the vector of differences v_s(k)&= & ( p_i(x_s ) -q_i(u_s))_1 i k , and we put j_n(k)&=&_s=1^nv_s(k ) . under @xmath48 ,",
    "@xmath49 has mean zero and finite @xmath50 variance - covariance matrix @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the expectation under @xmath48 and @xmath53 is the transposition of @xmath54 .",
    "next , let us define the empirical version of @xmath55 under @xmath48 , that is the @xmath50 matrix @xmath56 in the following , we assume that @xmath57 is a positive - definite matrix so that the corresponding inverse matrix and its square root exist . note that this condition is satisfied a.s",
    ". for @xmath16 large enough since the estimator is consistent .",
    "we consider the test statistic @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the euclidian norm on @xmath60 .",
    "application of the central limit theorem shows that under @xmath48 , @xmath61 converges in distribution to a @xmath62 random variable with @xmath11 degrees of freedom as @xmath16 tends to infinity .",
    "the strategy is to select an appropriate degree @xmath11 ; that is , a correct number of components in the test statistics .",
    "in addition , observe that the null hypothesis can be rewritten as @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "suppose that the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath65 of @xmath66 equals the empirical mean of the sample of the @xmath67 s , that is @xmath68 , as it is the case for instance when the distribution of @xmath54 belongs to an exponential family .",
    "then , @xmath61 is the score statistic and the schwarz criteria is well adapted to get an automatic selection of @xmath11 .",
    "in this section , the data - driven method introduced by ledwina ( 1994 ) ( see also inglot et al . 1997 ) is used to optimize the parameter @xmath11 in our test statistic .",
    "it is based on a modified version of schwarz s bayesian information rule .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath69 , is such that @xmath70 where @xmath71 can be either fixed , equal to @xmath13 , or increasing such that @xmath72 .",
    "once @xmath69 is determined , the test statistic is applied with @xmath73 .",
    "more precisely , we use for our testing problem the statistic @xmath74 .",
    "hereafter , the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is derived under the null hypothesis for cases where @xmath71 is fixed or unbounded .",
    "[ theo0 ] assume that @xmath76 is fixed . under @xmath48 ,",
    "when @xmath16 tends to infinity , @xmath74 converges in distribution to a @xmath62 random variable with 1 degree of freedom .",
    "the proof is fairly standard and follows ledwina ( 1994 ) .",
    "we will detail a more general proof in the case where @xmath71 is unbounded ( see theorem [ theo2 ] ) .    in our simulations , we fixed @xmath13 large enough , in the sense that its value was neither reached by @xmath69 , either under the null ( for empirical level calculations ) or under alternatives ( for empirical power calculations ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath77 and @xmath52 the probability and the expectation under @xmath48 . write @xmath78 the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath57 .",
    "we now let @xmath71 tend to infinity under the following two conditions :    ( a1 ) @xmath79 .",
    "( a2 ) there exists some positive constant @xmath80 such that for all @xmath81 , @xmath82 where @xmath83 .    the condition ( a1 )",
    "can be compared to results obtained in the framework of random matrices .",
    "for instance , bai and yin ( 1993 ) ( see also silverstein , 1985 , for the particular gaussian case ) considered the case where the entries @xmath84 are independent and identically distributed with finite fourth moment ( this moment condition may be compared with ( a2 ) ) .",
    "they shown that almost surely @xmath85 when @xmath86 .",
    "then when the random series @xmath87 is bounded we get @xmath88 and @xmath71 can be chosen as @xmath89 .",
    "assumption ( a2 ) states that the fourth moment is bounded on average .",
    "it is similar to assumption 2 stated in ledoit and wolf ( 2004 ) .",
    "more precisely , ledoit and wolf used a condition on the eighth moment which is somewhat more restrictive .",
    "[ theo2 ] let assumptions ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) hold .",
    "thus , under @xmath48 , @xmath74 converges in distribution to a @xmath62 random variable with 1 degree of freedom .    * proof * the proof is partly inspired by janic - wrblewska and ledwina ( 2000 ) .",
    "first note that the greatest eigenvalue of @xmath90 is the inverse of its smallest eigenvalue .",
    "then we have @xmath91 , where",
    "@xmath92 stands for the spectral norm . under @xmath48 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath93 converges to a @xmath62 random variable with one degree of freedom .",
    "then we have to prove that @xmath94 tends to 1 as @xmath16 tends to infinity , or equivalently that @xmath95 tends to 0 .",
    "let us set @xmath96 .",
    "by definition of @xmath69 , we have @xmath97 using the standard norm s inequalities for matrices and vectors we get @xmath98 that we combine with markov inequality to obtain @xmath99 using the independence of the pairs @xmath100 , we get _ 0 ( j_n(k)^2)&=&_0 ( _ s=1^n_t=1^n v_s(k)v_t(k ) ) + & = & _ s=1^n _ 0(v_s(k)v_s(k ) ) + & = & _ 0(v_1(k)^2 ) .",
