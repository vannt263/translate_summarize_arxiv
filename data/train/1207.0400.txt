    "the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) continues to receive enormous attention both experimentally and theoretically worldwide @xcite .",
    "qcd is expected to reveal a rich phase structure in the plane of temperature @xmath7 and baryon chemical potential @xmath8 .",
    "monte - carlo simulations in lattice gauge theory provide a powerful non - perturbative first principle approach to qcd . at finite baryon chemical potential , however , they are restricted by the fermion - sign problem , the fermion determinant becomes complex , in general , and it can therefore no longer be interpreted as part of a probability measure .",
    "there are various ways to deal with the sign problem @xcite , but the region of large baryon chemical potential and low temperature , @xmath9 , essentially remains inaccessible to lattice simulations .",
    "this is one motivation to study effective models with qcd symmetries such as ( polyakov-)nambu - jona - lasinio ( ( p)njl ) @xcite or ( polyakov-)quark - meson ( ( p)qm ) models @xcite , in order to describe the expected gross features of the qcd phase diagram at finite baryon chemical potential .",
    "the sign problem also motivates studies of qcd - like theories without this problem such as qcd with isospin chemical potential @xmath1 or two - color qcd @xcite . in both cases",
    "the fermion determinant remains real , and for an even number of degenerate quark flavors positive at finite density .",
    "consequently , lattice studies can be performed for both , qcd at finite isospin density @xcite as well as two - color qcd at finite baryon density @xcite . in both these cases",
    "one studies a bosonic superfluid with bec - bcs crossover towards higher densities in the low temperature , finite density region , however .",
    "an interesting qcd replacement with fermionic baryons is the exceptional @xmath10 gauge theory @xcite which can also be simulated at finite density without sign problem @xcite .",
    "such lattice simulations allow to benchmark and cross - check the effective model calculations @xcite as well as non - perturbative functional continuum methods for full qcd in general @xcite .",
    "in this letter we use the functional renormalization group ( frg ) to study collective mesonic fluctuations in the two - flavor qm model for qcd at finite baryon and isospin chemical potential . as compared to the standard ( @xmath11 ) phase diagram , finite isospin chemical potential thereby induces an imbalance between up and down quarks as in neutron stars or heavy ion collisions , for example .",
    "the region of high baryon density , where this becomes relevant , can not be described by a qm model without any baryonic degrees of freedom , of course . on the other hand , in color superconducting quark matter at even higher density , isospin chemical potential will eventually destroy bcs pairing probably leading through an fflo phase into an unpaired state @xcite .",
    "the other way round , finite baryon or isosymmetric quark chemical potential @xmath12 will lead to an imbalance of the fermi spheres of up and anti - down quarks and thus destroy pion condensation in the ( @xmath13 ) phase diagram , transgressing through an fflo phase , likewise @xcite .",
    "moreover , the standard qcd phase diagram with baryon chemical potential is related to that with isospin chemical potential outside the pion condensation phase via orbifold equivalence in the large @xmath14-limit @xcite . just as two - color qcd @xcite",
    ", the latter can be described at sufficiently low temperatures within the framework of chiral effective field theory @xcite and random matrix theory @xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "chiral perturbation theory predicts a second order quantum phase transition at @xmath15 , the onset of pion condensation .",
    "this is an exact property whose explicit verification from the grand partition function is called the silver blaze problem @xcite .",
    "it relates the onset of pion condensation to the ( vacuum ) pion mass @xmath16 .",
    "the charged pions couple to @xmath17 , so their excitation thresholds are given by @xmath18 , and the zero - temperature limit of the partition function must remain independent of @xmath1 below the critical value of the isospin chemical potential at which @xmath19 .",
    "the two - flavor theory at @xmath20 is invariant under the full @xmath21 flavor rotations in @xmath22 .",
    "isospin chemical potential is associated with the conserved charge corresponding to the @xmath23 subgroup of rotations in the @xmath24 plane .",
    "it acts as an external field which explicitly breaks the @xmath21 down to @xmath23 , but the zero temperature limit of the partition function remains unchanged as long as its strength is not sufficient to excite charged pions . when the isospin chemical potential reaches its critical value at @xmath25 , on the other hand , the resulting pionic nambu - goldstone excitations of zero energy lead to the spontaneous breaking of the corresponding @xmath23 symmetry , and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of charged pions occurs .",
    "considering non - zero values for both isospin and isosymmetric quark chemical potential , more general constraints arise from the silver blaze property in the zero temperature ( @xmath3 ) phase diagram as we will discuss below .",
    "we furthermore present the phase diagram of the qm model for two - flavor qcd in the three - dimensional parameter space of temperature , isospin and isosymmetric quark chemical potential .",
    "as compared to previous model studies , mainly within the njl model @xcite , the frg approach is thereby well equipped to include the corresponding collective mesonic fluctuations in the description of chiral versus pion condensation .",
    "with the standard two - flavor chiral symmetry - breaking pattern , @xmath26 , finite isospin chemical potential leads to a further explicit breaking of the @xmath27 isospin symmetry down to the rotations about the iso - three direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , on the quark level to @xmath28 . in the pion condensation phase at @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , this remnant chiral symmetry then spontaneously breaks down to a discrete @xmath31 symmetry , @xmath32 , with a non - vanishing pion - condensate as the order parameter and one nambu - goldstone boson . as the isospin chemical potential",
    "is further increased , the pion condensate increases and the chiral condensate decreases corresponding to a rotation of the vacuum alignment in a bec - bcs crossover .",
    "the approximate chiral symmetry gets partially restored , and the asymptotic @xmath33 symmetry for @xmath34 in the pion condensation phase agrees with that obtained in a hypothetical world with isospin chemical potential but without any chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath35sb ) and hence quark mass @xmath36 as summarized in table  [ tab : ssb ] .",

    "effective potential , it makes no sense to separate the initial potential from the contributions due to fluctuations as in .",
    "differences at the uv scale are reduced by the mesonic fluctuations . as a result , the phase structure from full frg calculations is less sensitive to the resulting sigma mass than in mean - field calculations .",
    "first consider the zero temperature quantum phase transition with pion condensation at @xmath39 .",
    "we have calculated the isospin density from the @xmath1-derivative of the effective potential .",
    "the result is shown in where the rescaled isospin chemical potential @xmath40 is plotted over the isospin density @xmath41 for our emf and frg solutions in comparison with very recent lattice data from ref .",
    "@xcite and the leading order chiral effective field theory ( @xmath35pt ) result @xcite .",
    "the isopin density remains zero below the onset of pion condensation at @xmath42 in the emf calculation as it must while the full frg result shows a slight residual silver blaze problem here , which might be due to numerical integration and infrared cutoff uncertainties . for large @xmath1 , deep into the pion condensation phase , it gets increasingly difficult to control systematic errors in the full frg calculations , _",
    "e.g. _ , because the assumption of @xmath1-independent initial parameters at a fixed ultraviolet cutoff breaks down eventually .",
    "while the chiral effective field theory result describes the bec phase well , it appears to miss some essential dynamics in the bec - bcs crossover , which we estimate to occur around @xmath43 in our calculations by the simple criterion that the quarks dirac mass falls below @xmath1 there .",
    "because the vacuum realignment in this crossover is characterized by the mixing between the sigma meson with the charged pions in the qm model , this suggests that it might indeed be this mixing of the meson mass eigenstates which is responsible for the observed inflection point and back - bending of the isospin density at large @xmath1 . the analogous mixing",
    "is seen in the mass spectrum of the qmd model for two - color qcd @xcite , between diquarks and the sigma meson .",
    "basically , the latter is infinitely heavy in @xmath35pt , so the low - lying excitation spectrum of the qm model is essentially different from that of the non - linear sigma model , especially in the crossover region where the mixing occurs .",
    "the qualitative effect on the isospin density can be illustrated in the _ linear _ sigma model , where a simple calculation yields , @xmath44 for @xmath45 , and with @xmath46 . in the @xmath47 limit",
    ", this reduces to the @xmath35pt result @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "compared to that , a finite sigma mass @xmath49 in the linear sigma model has the same qualitative effect as observed in the emf results of for parameter sets a , b and c in tab .  [ tab : parameter 1 ] .",
    "the general structure of the phase diagram in the @xmath50 plane is also strongly constrained by the silver blaze property .",
    "the key to its understanding is the fact that different degrees of freedom couple to different combinations of the chemical potentials . while up(down)-quarks couple to @xmath51 , charged pions obviously only couple to the isospin chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "the partition function and , correspondingly , thermodynamic observables must remain independent of @xmath52 _ and _ @xmath1 as long as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath16 are the vacuum quark and pion masses , respectively .",
    "this defines a quadrilateral area in the zero - temperature phase diagram , which we refer to as the _ first silver blaze region _ in the following .",
    "the physical picture is that in absence of bound quark matter , the horizontal line in the ( @xmath56 ) plane defines the boundary of this region beyond which a degenerate fermi gas of up - quarks forms , just as the vertical line marks the onset of pion condensation .",
    "another constraint arises inside the pion condensation phase : for @xmath57 the vacuum changes and the grand potential becomes @xmath1-dependent , of course .",
    "nevertheless , for constant @xmath1 , it has to remain independent of the isosymmetric quark chemical potential @xmath5 as long as this stays below the lightest quark mass , _",
    "i.e. _ , for @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are the quark masses at @xmath60 .",
    "they no longer correspond to pure up- and down- quark excitations as these mix in the pion condensation phase , and the quark masses are obtained by diagonalizing @xmath61 .",
    "more generally , from the quark dispersion relation @xmath62 one furthermore notes that for @xmath63 it becomes energetically favorable to excite quarks with a finite spatial momentum @xmath64 and minimal energy @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this might be an indication for an inhomogeneous phase at large isospin chemical potential such as the fflo phases @xcite also discussed for two - color qcd with isospin chemical potential @xcite or in the 1 + 1 dimensional njl model @xcite .",
    "therefore , the conditions @xmath66 with @xmath58 for @xmath67 , or @xmath68 for @xmath69 , together define a region in the zero - temperature phase diagram in which the @xmath1-dependent grand potential still remains independent of @xmath52 , nevertheless .",
    "we will call this the _ second silver blaze region _ in the following .",
    "note however that the whole argument holds only as long as there are no first order transitions in these regions of the phase diagram .",
    "this concerns in particular the possible first order transition for large @xmath52 and small @xmath1 which may intersect with the first silver blaze region .",
    "if it does , the cep where it ends must lie outside , however .",
    "this could then be the chiral first order transition or a liquid - gas transition to bound quark matter below the threshold for free quarks , for example , which are of course not excluded .",
    "in contrast , a first order line with an endpoint inside the silver blaze region would be thermodynamically inconsistent .",

    "<S> we study the two - flavor quark - meson ( qm ) model with the functional renormalization group ( frg ) to describe the effects of collective mesonic fluctuations on the phase diagram of qcd at finite baryon _ and _ isospin chemical potentials , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . with only isospin chemical potential </S>",
    "<S> there is a precise equivalence between the competing dynamics of chiral versus pion condensation and that of collective mesonic and baryonic fluctuations in the quark - meson - diquark model for two - color qcd at finite baryon chemical potential . here , finite @xmath2 introduces an additional dimension to the phase diagram as compared to two - color qcd , however . at zero temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the ( @xmath3)-plane of this phase diagram is strongly constrained by the `` silver blaze problem . '' in particular , the onset of pion condensation must occur at @xmath4 , independent of @xmath5 as long as @xmath6 stays below the constituent quark mass of the qm model or the liquid - gas transition line of nuclear matter in qcd . in order to maintain this relation beyond mean field it is crucial to compute the pion mass from its timelike correlator with the frg in a consistent way .    </S>",
