    "* ) completely changed our view on these stars revealing the true complexity of their pulsational behaviour .",
    "some of the rr lyrae stars , which were previously considered to pulsate purely radially in the fundamental ( f mode , rrab ) , first - overtone ( 1o mode , rrc ) , or in both modes simultaneously ( f/1o modes , rrd ) , were found to show additional pulsational modes with low amplitude .",
    "@xcite discovered aq leo ( rrd star ) to be the first example of the most numerous group of stars showing additional variability ( lower index ` a ' ) with period @xmath6 in _ most _ data .",
    "this peculiar periodicity , with amplitude in the mmag regime , was detected in photometry collected by space telescopes _ corot _ and _ kepler _ ( see e.g. references * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but mainly in the ogle galactic bulge data where more than 260 such stars of both rrc and rrd types were identified @xcite .",

    "first - overtone pulsators also show additional periodicity with @xmath8 @xcite , which has not yet been explained .",
    "recently another new subclass of double - mode rr lyraes had been identified @xcite .",

    "the fundamental mode is the dominant periodicity among these stars .",
    "rrd stars with atypical period ratios detected earlier in the galactic bulge @xcite and in m3 @xcite can also be classified as anomalous rrd stars .    in the first paper of the series",
    "@xcite we report the discovery of another group of fundamental mode rr lyrae stars showing additional mode with @xmath10 and with long fundamental mode period .",
    "this period ratio and pulsational models suggest that these stars could be an extreme case of rrd stars .    in this paper , we present results on 38 stars catalogued by ogle as rrab stars and on 4 stars identified as rrc variables with pulsation periods @xmath0days .",

    "after identification of the first long - period , double - periodic rr lyrae stars @xcite , we searched for additional double - periodic stars with period ratio close to 0.7 among all rrab and rrc stars observed by ogle - iv in the galactic bulge ( 36190 stars in total ) .",
    "we used automatic procedure pysca @xcite employing nonlinear - least squares methods and the lomb - scargle algorithm for identification of the suspicious periodicity .",
    "we looked for an additional signal ( with @xmath11 ) in range from @xmath12c / d up to @xmath13c / d to avoid possible contamination with stars exhibiting blazhko effect .",
    "if we found such signal , the star was sassigned to a candidate group and analysed manually in the same way as in our previous study @xcite :    we followed a standard consecutive pre - whitening technique ( fitting sine series ) .",
    "we considered only well resolved significant peaks ( @xmath11 ) with separation larger than @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is data length . if necessary , the outliers were omitted ( 4@xmath16 clipping ) and secular trends were removed using low - order polynomials or spline functions .",
    "we also analyzed both magnitude and flux - scaled data to avoid confusion of possible artificial peaks with the combination peaks .",

    "the characteristic , asymmetric light curve shape ( fig .",

    "it must correspond to pulsation .",
    "the large amplitude and non - linear , triangular shape of the light curve immediately suggests the radial fundamental mode . a glimpse at the fourier parameter plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : depen - koef ] ) points however , that this is not the light curve shape that is typical for rrab stars with such short pulsation periods .",
    "in fact , genuine rrab stars with periods shorter than @xmath80days are scarce in the galactic bulge and nearly not present for periods shorter than @xmath81days .",
    "the light curves do not resemble the rrc light curves either .",
    "the fourier parameters corresponding to the dominant variability lie _ in between _ the parameters typical for rrab and rrc stars .    the secondary variability in the discussed stars , is always of shorter period and of lower amplitude as compared to the dominant variability .",
    "the corresponding light curve shape is a pure sine wave in nearly all the cases , i.e. we do not detect the harmonics of the additional variability .",
    "the secondary period is too short to be connected with rotation or with the binarity effects . in the petersen diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : petersen ] ) , the newly identified group forms a rather large cloud that touches the rrd sequence at its extreme , short - period tail .",
    "we note in passing , that this tail is observed only in the galactic bulge , and explained as due to high metallicity rrd variables @xcite .",
    "could the discussed stars be extreme cases of rrd variables , with the radial fundamental and radial first - overtone modes excited ?",
    "such possibility can be easily verified with linear pulsation calculations .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] .",
    "we used exactly the same set of models as in @xcite and the reader is referred to its sect .",
    "4.1 for all technical details .",
    "the filled symbols mark the models in which both radial modes are simultaneously unstable  a necessary condition for the non - resonant beat pulsation .",
    "open symbols to the left , correspond to the models in which only the first - overtone is unstable and open symbols to the right , correspond to the models in which only the fundamental mode is unstable .",
    "although the models cover a wide range of metallicities , masses and luminosities , it is clear that our group can not correspond to rrd pulsation . only for the highest ( solar ) metallicity , the highest mass ( @xmath82 ) , and the lowest luminosity ( @xmath83 ) , the models in which both radial modes are simultaneously unstable approach the part of the petersen diagram in which the new , double - periodic variables reside .",
    "the extreme rrd scenario must be dropped .",
    "the models also indicate , that for the considered range of physical parameters , it is even hard to get the unstable fundamental mode at such short periods .",
    "recently , @xcite identified a new group of anomalous rrd variables .",
    "these stars however , have longer fundamental mode periods and higher period ratios ( still , typically lower than in the `` classical '' rrd stars ) , so their position in the petersen diagram is easily reproduced assuming excitation of radial fundamental and first - overtone modes .",
    "in addition , blazhko - like modulation is commonly detected in anomalous rrd stars .",
    "variables discussed in this paper clearly do not belong to this group .",
    "the other possibility we now consider , is that the discussed stars are the so - called binary evolution pulsators ( beps ) .",
    "the first , and so far the only member of this group , is ogle - blg - rrlyr-02792 .",
    "the star was catalogued as rrab , member of the eclipsing binary system @xcite .",
    "its dynamical mass is only @xmath84 however @xcite , definitely too low for rr  lyr variable .",
    "beps are stars that evolved in the binary system and , after experiencing the mass loss event , enter the classical instability strip . the non - linear model survey conducted by @xcite shows that such objects may indeed show large - amplitude radial pulsation that may mimic rr  lyr variability .",
    "in fact , models presented in @xcite seem to support the hypothesis that the discussed double - periodic stars are beps .",
    "the expected fundamental mode light curves at the blue edge of the classical instability strip have simple triangle - like form ( fig .  11 in * ? ? ?",
    "the fourier parameters of hot beps fall in between rrab and rrc stars ( their fig .",
    "13 ; beginning of the model sequences ) .",
    "also , close to the blue edge , both low order radial modes may be simultaneously excited ( their fig .  3 ) and beat pulsation is thus possible .",
    "the linear pulsation models disprove this scenario as well .",
    "we have computed a grid of models with masses in the @xmath85 range , with luminosities in the @xmath86 range and metallicity range the same as considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] ( other model parameters are the same as in * ? ? ?",
    "we note that little is known about expected physical parameters of beps , as only one object was observed so far ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "the range of the physical parameters given above , is motivated by the model study by @xcite , and assures that model periods are not far from those observed in rr  lyr stars .",
    "the models assume homogeneous envelope with chemical composition the same as in rr  lyr - type models . for @xmath87 and @xmath88 models , periods of the unstable radial modes are significantly longer than observed in our stars .",
    "period ratios for @xmath89 models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelsbep ] . the models have longer periods and higher period ratios , and are far from the region in which double - periodic stars reside .",
    "clearly , the discussed stars are not fundamental and first - overtone double - mode radial pulsators .",
    "at least , not assuming their physical parameters are close to expected for rr  lyr stars or beps ( that mimic rr  lyr stars ) .",
    "other combinations of radial modes do not fit the discussed group as well .",
    "we note that simple triangular light curve shape is characteristic for fundamental mode hads stars .",
    "fourier parameters of these stars are similar as well ( see fig . 8 and figs .",
    "4 - 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* note that cosine convention is adopted in that paper ) .",
    "periods of these stars are typically below @xmath90days however , while in our stars they are longer than @xmath91days .",
    "period ratios in the radial multi - mode hads stars are also vastly different , see e.g. fig .  10 in @xcite .    assuming that the dominant variability do correspond to the radial fundamental mode ( large amplitude and nonlinear light curve shape make this hypothesis most plausible )",
    ", the additional variability may correspond to non - radial pulsation mode .",
    "low - degree modes may be excited in rr  lyr models @xcite , preferentially in the vicinity of the radial modes .",
    "although the frequency spectrum of such modes is very dense , their growth rates do display a local maximum close to the position of the radial modes .",
    "in particular , for @xmath92 modes , the growth rates approach that of the radial first - overtone mode and their frequency is higher than radial first - overtone frequency [ see e.g. fig .  1 in @xcite or fig .  1 in @xcite ] .",
    "this would lead to the period ratios a bit lower than observed for rrd variables , which is what we want .",
    "[ fig : models ] seems to disprove this scenario again .",
    "non - radial modes of @xmath92 are unstable only if the first - overtone is unstable , which occurs at longer fundamental mode periods than observed in the discussed stars .",
    "also , it would not be clear why the non - radial mode is excited instead of the neighbouring , strongly driven radial first - overtone .    at the moment we have no explanation for the nature of the discussed double - periodic variables .",
    "we present the discovery of a new group of double - periodic stars in the ogle galactic bulge photometry . in 38 stars identified in the ogle catalog as the fundamental mode rr lyrae stars and in 4 stars identified as the first - overtone pulsators ( rrc ) ,",
    "we detect additional variability of lower amplitude and of a shorter period .",
    "the period ratios in the discovered stars ( @xmath39 ) are lower than in the galactic bulge rrd stars ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "although our stars do not form a sharp sequence in the petersen diagram , they occupy a well - defined region . also , their light curves are very similar and different from the light curves of single - periodic rrab and rrc stars .",
    "this is best demonstrated with the help of fourier decomposition parameters .",
    "the fourier coefficients @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for discovered stars differ from typical values for stars in rrab and rrc group . for the fourier parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , our group lies somewhere in the middle , between single periodic rrc and rrab stars .",
    "the newly discovered double - periodic stars have higher values of these coefficients in comparison with rrc stars .",
    "the similar difference applies for the phase coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 where our group creates some kind of a transition between the fundamental mode and first - overtone pulsators .",
    "in addition , stars in our group have the lowest values of these coefficients among rrc stars .",
    "our findings suggest that the original ogle classification as rrab or rrc is questionable in our stars .",
    "ten stars from our sample show properties typical for blazhko - type modulation ( equidistant peaks in the frequency spectrum ) . in the majority of modulated stars , the modulation side peaks are symmetrical , or we observe that higher frequency side peak is of higher amplitude .",
    "the additional periodicity is always of lower amplitude . except for one case ,",
    "amplitude ratios are below 0.6 ; the most typical value is 0.2 ( see the top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : adpd ] ) . considering the amplitude of the dominant variability",
    "( see the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : adpd ] ) , our stars divide into two groups : with larger amplitude ( @xmath94mag , all stars originally classified as rrab , except two ) and with lower amplitude ( @xmath95mag , four stars originally classified as rrc and two as rrab )",
    ". origin of the apparent gap in the distribution of amplitudes of the dominant variability is unclear .",
    "we find it very challenging to explain the nature of the discovered group .",
    "although these stars were identified as rr  lyrae , their properties are very different from single periodic rrab and rrc stars and from double - mode rrd stars .",
    "rr  lyrae identification is thus tentative .",
    "the triangular shape of the light curve of the dominant periodicity strongly suggests that it corresponds to the pulsation in the radial fundamental mode . however , the light curve shape is clearly different from that observed in rrab stars .",
    "period ratios are also significantly smaller than observed in rrd stars . with linear pulsation models",
    "we have checked , that location of these stars in the petersen diagram can not be reproduced assuming that two radial modes are excited and assuming that their physical parameters are in the range expected for rr  lyrae stars or the so - called binary evolution pulsators ( masses @xmath96 , luminosities in the @xmath86 range , metallicities , [ fe / h ] from 0 to -2.5 ) .",
    "the scenario in which dominant variability corresponds to the radial fundamental mode and additional variability corresponds to non - radial mode also faces difficulty .",
