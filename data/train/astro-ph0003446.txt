    "@xmath0  pictoris  is the most extensively studied of the young planetary systems discovered in the last decade and a half .",
    "it is a bright southern hemisphere star ( type a5 v ) , located about 19.3 pc distant from the sun , with a systemic radial velocity of 20 km s@xmath12 ( for a review of the @xmath0  pictoris  system , see @xcite ) .",
    "it was observed in 1983 by the iras satellite to have a large excess of emission at infrared wavelengths .",
    "this was referred to as the vega - like phenomenon and was identified as arising from an edge - on circumstellar ( hereafter cs ) dust disk , presumed to be associated with planetary formation @xcite .",
    "it was soon determined through absorption spectroscopy that there was cs gas associated with the dust as well .",
    "a large body of evidence has accumulated indicating that there are comet - like bodies present in the @xmath0  pictoris  cs disk .",
    "collisions between dust particles are expected to produce submicron fragments which should be expelled from the system by radiation pressure on time scales much shorter than any plausible stellar age .",
    "thus there must be a secondary source of particles ; one model for the production of dust and gas in the cs disk focusses on evaporating comets and is called the orbiting evaporating bodies model ( oeb ) . in this picture , the comets orbit the star at several tens of au , and thus , the @xmath0  pictoris  cs disk is a kind of `` gigantic multi - cometary tail with its natural constituents : gas and dust ''",
    "spectra of @xmath0  pictoris  show variable redshifted absorption features arising from gas infalling toward the star at high velocities ( and infrequently , blueshifted features as well ) ; these features are best attributed to the evaporation of star - grazing comets , called the falling evaporating bodies scenario ( feb ) @xcite .",
    "also , gas at close to 20 km s@xmath12 ( zero radial velocity relative to the star ) is identified in all observations and is called the stable gas component .",
    "this gas is difficult to understand , as modeling indicates that it should be expelled from the system by radiation pressure ; a continuous source for this gas is required .",
    "neutral carbon and carbon monoxide have been observed in hst - ghrs uv absorption spectra of @xmath0  pictoris ; carbon monoxide is the only molecule detected in the cs disk to date @xcite . since co and  can be dissociated and ionized by interstellar uv photons on time scales of the order of 200 years , both must be continuously replenished .",
    "carbon monoxide , in particular , is difficult to reform after dissociation in the @xmath0  pictoris  environment .",
    "thus , the presence of these species indicates that a secondary source for this gas should exist , just as for the cs dust @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the column densities of  and co to be comparable , around @xmath13 @xmath3 ; since their rates of destruction are also comparable , this was taken as evidence that the  is produced by photodissociation of co , which evaporates from comets orbiting at various distances and velocities .",
    "however , the  column density was determined from a heavily saturated multiplet and is therefore quite uncertain . in the hopes of further constraining the characteristics of  and co in the @xmath0  pictoris  system",
    ", we have reinvestigated the transitions observed in the ghrs data , as well as some that were not seen due to the relatively low spectral resolution of ghrs compared with that of the stis high resolution echelle .",
    "hst stis high resolution echelle spectra of @xmath0  pictoris  were obtained on 1997 december 6 and 1997 december 19 , covering the wavelength range from 1459    to 2888   in six exposures each day .",
    "table  1 shows the log of observations .",
    "all the absorption features discussed in this paper appear in either the first or second data set listed for each day ( o4g001010/o4g002010 or o4g001020/o4g002020).the data were initially reduced and calibrated using the stsci iraf package _",
    "calstis v1.8_. spectra with a signal - to - noise ratio of around 10 were achieved .",
    "examination of the errors in the flux values showed that the error propagation calculation had not been performed correctly and that thestated errors were too small .",
    "therefore the data were re - calibrated using _",
    "calstis v1.9a _ , correcting the underestimate of the measurement errors .",
    "the particular advantage of this data set over previous comparable ones is the very high spectral resolution achieved .",
    "the instrumental line spread function using the e140h grating is well described by a gaussian with a fwhm of 1 pixel , corresponding to fwhm  =  @xmath14/220,000 @xcite . however , since the detector undersamples the line spread function , the effective resolution to separate two adjacent lines with this grating is only @xmath10  =  110,000 .",
    "using the e230h grating , the fwhm is about 2 pixels , corresponding to fwhm  =  @xmath14/110,000 @xcite .",
    "this previously undetected spin - forbidden transition @xmath15p@xmath16p@xmath17 at 1613.376   was clearly observed on both days . it is unsaturated , which allows for an improved determination of the column density of .",
    "as there was no change in the line between the two days of observation , the spectra were averaged together to improve the s / n ; the result is shown in figure  1 .",
    "unfortunately , the other two fine structure lines in the multiplet were not reliably detected .",
    "atomic data were taken from @xcite and the continuum around the line was fit with a sixth - degree polynomial .",
    "voigt line profiles were used to generate transmission functions , which were then convolved with a gaussian instrumental line spread function with fwhm  =  @xmath14/220,000 to create model spectra . the @xmath18 statistic between the model and the data",
    "was then minimized to determine the best velocity centroid , @xmath19 , column density of  in the ground level , @xmath20 , and doppler broadening parameter , @xmath21 ; error bars for these parameters were determined from the contours of @xmath18 .",
    "since the line was unsaturated , the column density was also determined from the equivalent width of the line and @xmath21 and @xmath19 were determined from a simple gaussian fit to the line , as a check on the results of the @xmath18 minimization .",
    "the central portion of the 1561   and 1657   multiplets , arising from the @xmath22p ground term , were heavily saturated in the stis data .",
    "however , this allowed us to examine the smaller variable red and blueshifted features in the spectra which are the signatures of infalling comets in the cs disk . in figures  2 and 3 ,",
    "one can easily see absorption lying at higher redshift in the december 6 data that is not visible in the december 19 data .",
    "a model of the multiplet which contains only one velocity component is unable to reproduce the absorption dip at 1561.5   or the absorption at higher",
    "redshift in the december 6 data .    due to the fact that the multiplets were extremely saturated and that the multiple velocity components were blended together , we were not able to perform @xmath18 minimizations to find unique best values for the model parameters .",
    "absorption features in our data set were analyzed and the velocities of their multiple velocity components found .",
    "models of the  @xmath141561 multiplet were constructed , containing the same number of components as were found in the features , with roughly the same velocities .",
    "the parameters of the stable component at @xmath19 = 20 km s@xmath12 were set to those determined from the analysis of the unsaturated 1613.376   line .",
    "the remaining parameters were then adjusted to find the best model by eye .",
    "this model was compared to the 1657    multiplet to confirm that the values found in this way were reasonable . a small constant value ( @xmath23 erg s@xmath12 @xmath3 @xmath12 )",
    "was subtracted from the 1657   data to bring the baselines of the totally saturated features to zero .",
    "these lines arise from the excited , metastable @xmath5d state of the ground configuration and have not previously been observed in spectra of @xmath0  pictoris .",
    "the @xmath5d level has a lifetime of about 4000 s , lying about 10,000 cm@xmath12 above the ground level ; c atoms in this state may be produced during the photodissociation of co in solar system comet comae @xcite .",
    "the 1931   lines were analyzed using the same model generating and @xmath18 minimization procedures described in   3.1 ; the atomic data used were from @xcite .",
    "although there may be some reason to suspect that the strong central absorption features near 1931.05   contain multiple velocity components , since this behavior is seen in lines arising from excited levels of other atomic species , the @xmath18 minimizations indicated that stable unique solutions containing more than one component in the central absorption features could not be found .",
    "thus , best models were found using only one velocity component . however , the difficulty involved in modeling a saturated , blended line is such that there may well be other undetected components present , so models with two components in the central absorption feature were compared to the data by eye .",
    "the 1463   spectra , shown in figure  5 , were so noisy that they served only to roughly confirm the values found from the 1931   line . a small constant flux value ( @xmath25 erg s@xmath12 @xmath3 @xmath12 )",
    "was subtracted from the 1463   data to bring the baselines of the saturated lines to zero .",
    "the ( 0 - 0 ) , ( 1 - 0 ) , and ( 2 - 0 ) bands of the fourth positive system of co ( @xmath26 ) did not vary between the two days of observation .",
    "the spectra were therefore averaged together to improve the s / n ; the result appears in figure  6 . only a single velocity component was observed .",
    "note the detection of bands arising from @xmath7co , the perturbation band @xmath27 ( 1 - 0 ) , not previously observed in spectra of @xmath0  pictoris , and the strong perturbation band @xmath28 ( 5 - 0 ) .",
    "models were generated using wavelengths and oscillator strengths from @xcite .",
    "energies of the ground state levels were calculated using the dunham coefficients from @xcite and lte assumed in order to determine the population of the rotational levels .",
    "the parameters of the model are the rotational excitation temperature , @xmath29 , the doppler broadening parameter , @xmath21 , the column density of @xmath9co in the ground vibrational state , @xmath30 , the column density of @xmath7co in the ground vibrational state , @xmath31 , and the velocity centroid , @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath18  minimization was then performed on all three bands simultaneously .",
    "the ] @xmath141613.376 line showed only one velocity component at 20 km s@xmath12 , the systemic velocity of the star ; the nominal uncertainty in the absolute wavelength calibration of stis leads to an error in velocity determinations of about 1 km s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this velocity and the fact that the line did not change between the two days of observation identifies the line as arising from stable gas .",
    "the results of the @xmath18 minimizations for all the features analyzed appear in table  2 .",
    "the column density for stable carbon in the ground level , @xmath22p@xmath32 , determined from @xmath18  minimization was found to agree with that determined from the equivalent width of the line .",
    "similarly the @xmath19 and @xmath21 determined from @xmath18 minimization agreed with the values found from fitting a simple gaussian to the unsaturated line .    using a 3-@xmath33 upper limit on the column density of  in the @xmath22p@xmath34 level ( from the non - detection of the fine structure line at 1614.5068  ) and assuming lte , a firm upper limit of 100 k on the excitation temperature of @xmath22p carbon in the stable component was found . from analysis of the 1561    multiplet ,",
    "discussed below , it was found that the excitation temperature of the stable component must be greater than about 50 k , or the multiplet could not be reasonably modeled .",
    "this range in temperature allows us to determine that the total column density of stable  in the @xmath22p ground term is @xmath35  @xmath3 .",
    "this column density is more than an order of magnitude larger than the total @xmath22p column density found by @xcite from ghrs data taken in november 1994 , @xmath1@xmath36 @xmath3 .",
    "either the abundance of stable  has varied over the three years between observations or , as is more likely , the difficult modeling of the heavily saturated  @xmath141561 multiplet in the ghrs data led to an inaccurate column density .",
    "models with column densities of @xmath37 @xmath3 in the stable component were compared to the 1994 ghrs spectrum of the 1561   multiplet and found to fit the data equally well as models with the lower column density .",
    "we found the doppler broadening parameter of the stable ( @xmath22p )  to be @xmath38 .",
    "the previous work on the ghrs data found a doppler broadening parameter of 4.2 km s@xmath12 , which was much greater than the parameter found for the other atomic species and co @xcite .",
    "our smaller @xmath21 value is equal to that found for co in our data ; we thus do not see any excess kinetic energy in the motions of the  atoms .",
    "the difficulty in modeling a saturated , blended multiplet is formidable , and the values determined for the multiple velocity components of ( @xmath22p )  from the 1561   multiplet are not reliable .",
    "however , this analysis did confirm that models with column densities of @xmath37 @xmath3 in the stable component could reasonably fit the 1561   spectra .",
    "we can also conclude that the total column density of ( @xmath22p )  in the variable components is about @xmath39 @xmath3 on december 6 and about @xmath13 @xmath3 on december 19 , to within an order of magnitude or so .",
    "it is also clear that the variable  features are generally better fit with higher excitation temperatures and larger @xmath21 parameters , but these values are very poorly determined .      using models with only one velocity component in the strong central absorption features ,",
    "two components arising from the excited @xmath5d level of  were found in the december 6 data , only one in the december 19 data .",
    "the best models are overplotted on the spectra in figures  4 and 5 .",
    "note that the central absorption features do not appear at the same velocity on the two days , that they also do not appear at the systemic velocity of the star , and that the column density of ( @xmath5d )  changes significantly between the two days of observation .",
    "this would seem to indicate that there is no stable component for ( @xmath5d ) .",
    "models with two velocity components in the central absorption feature , which were compared to the data by eye , indicate that there could be a `` stable '' component which has the same column density on both days . however , it must be at about 22 - 23 km s@xmath12 , which is significantly different from the systemic velocity of @xmath0  pictoris .",
    "these data are not able to conclusively determine the velocity structure present in the ( @xmath5d )  gas ; observation of unsaturated lines at similarly high resolution will be necessary .",
    "[ [ co ] ] co ~~    the co bands showed no multiple velocity component structure and no change between the two days of observation ; the absorbing gas is thus entirely associated with the stable component at the systemic velocity of the star .",
    "the best model is shown overplotted on the data in figure  6 . the rotational excitation temperature and the ratio of @xmath30 to @xmath31 show no significant change from the values found by @xcite .",
    "@xmath40  =  @xmath11 is quite small compared to typical values found in the ism , e.g. @xmath10  =  @xmath41 for the diffuse clouds toward @xmath42  ophiuchi @xcite .",
    "however , chemical fractionation at low kinetic temperatures can explain this unusual ratio , as discussed below .",
    "the column densities of both @xmath9co and @xmath7co were found to be about 1/3 the values found from the ghrs data .",
    "note that the column density of @xmath9co is about 50 times smaller than the column density of stable ( @xmath22p ) .",
    "although co in solar system comet comae is photodissociated by solar fuv photons , the co in the @xmath0  pictoris  cs disk is primarily destroyed by interstellar photons .",
    "the dissociation energy for co is 11.1 ev ; thus co may only be dissociated by photons with wavelengths shortward of @xmath43  1100  .",
    "the type a5 star @xmath0  pictoris  lacks the strong fuv emission lines created in the sun s chromosphere ; thus it emits very little flux in the fuv . the only source for co - dissociating photons at @xmath0  pictoris  is therefore the interstellar uv radiation field .",
    "since co photodissociates primarily through discrete line absorptions , self - shielding can have a strong effect on the abundance of co in interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "however , this is unlikely to occur in the @xmath0  pictoris  cs disk because of the very small transverse dimension of the disk .",
    "thus , the photodissociation rate for @xmath9co in the @xmath0  pictoris  disk should be equal to the unshielded value and should also be equal to the value for @xmath7co .",
    "since @xmath7co is not selectively dissociated in this situation , its high abundance was explained by the reaction @xmath44 which favors the production of @xmath7co at gas kinetic temperatures below 35 k @xcite . assuming chemical equilibrium and that isotopic exchange is much more important than photodissociation for both @xmath9co and @xmath7co @xcite , @xmath45 the rotational excitation temperature of co often does not accurately describe the gas kinetic temperature in diffuse environments @xcite .",
    "however , assuming a @xmath46 ratio , we may use the above expression to estimate the true gas kinetic temperature of the co.    the average carbon isotopic ratio in the local ism is @xmath47 @xcite and the typical solar system value found in comets is @xmath48 @xcite . using the range @xmath49 , we find that the gas kinetic temperature of the carbon monoxide is 20  k @xmath50 25  k , indicating that the co gas is indeed colder than the stable  gas .",
    "this suggests that the  and co are not located in the same regions of the disk . the assumption that isotopic exchange is more important than photodissociation should be reasonable .",
    "for this assumption to apply , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the unshielded photodissociation rate , @xmath53 @xcite , k@xmath54 is the forward reaction rate , @xmath55 at 80 k @xcite , and n@xmath56 is the volume density of @xmath57 .",
    "the average volume density of c , @xmath58 , assuming that the carbon extends over a distance @xmath59 = 100 au .",
    "further assuming that @xmath60 , as is likely , the right hand side of the above expression is greater than or equal to about @xmath61 , an order of magnitude larger than @xmath52 .",
    "however , a more complete treatment of the relationship between @xmath62 and @xmath46 takes into account photodissociation but requires exact knowledge of the density of @xmath57 in the cs disk @xcite .",
    "the much larger column density of ( @xmath22p )  compared to that of co leads us to believe that photodissociation of co can not be the only source of stable  in the @xmath0  pictoris  cs disk . since there is no evidence that co is produced by infalling comets ( no variability or red and blueshifted features ) , it has been postulated that the co gas slowly evaporates from the oebs at several tens of au from the star and is photodissociated to produce the stable  @xcite .",
    "obviously some portion of the  gas must be produced directly from the febs ( the portion giving rise to the variable red and blueshifted absorption ) ; perhaps this  gas is decelerated somehow and accumulates in the stable component before being destroyed by photoionization . in this scenario ,",
    "the equilibrium column density of  is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mean number of infalling comets per year , @xmath65 per year @xcite , @xmath66 is the total column density of  gas produced by an infalling comet , and @xmath52 is the photoionization rate for , 0.004 yr@xmath12 .",
    "this expression , which assumes that  atoms are lost only through photoionization by interstellar uv photons , gives @xmath67 @xmath3 , which should easily be produced by infalling comets like the ones giving rise to the variable ( @xmath22p )  components in our data .",
    "however , this is a rough treatment and the number of infalling comets per year varies significantly over time scales of a few years @xcite .",
    "also , this treatment does not take into account reformation of  by radiative recombination ; we can not take this process into account properly without knowledge of the amount of in the cs disk and the electron density .",
    "considering the ( @xmath5d ) , when such atoms are produced by photodissociation of co , ( @xmath5d ) atoms must be produced also to conserve spin .",
    "the minimum total photon energy needed for this dissociation is 14.33 ev , corresponding to a threshold wavelength of 865  .",
    "since this threshold is below the lyman limit , there are virtually no interstellar uv photons capable of producing ( @xmath5d )  by photodissociation of co. thus , the ( @xmath5d )  atoms in the @xmath0  pictoris  cs disk can not be produced by photodissociation of co by stellar or interstellar photons and must be produced by a collisional process involving ground state carbon atoms . since the energy of the @xmath5d state relative to the ground state is high , the collisional process must be a very energetic one and therefore is likely to be closely associated with the infalling bodies . consequently , with a short ( @xmath5d )   lifetime , there would be no stable component in this gas ; this behavior has not been previously seen in any constituent of the @xmath0  pictoris  cs disk . but",
    "this result is tentavive ; examination of an unsaturated line at high resolution is needed to determine the velocity structure of the ( @xmath5d )  gas .",
    "the very high resolution , low scattered light contamination , and good order separation of this stis echelle data set has provided some clear advantages over previous observations of @xmath0  pictoris .",
    "the rotational lines of co have been resolved , allowing for a much more precise determination of the physical parameters of the gas .",
    "the column density of co is @xmath68 and the ratio @xmath69 is found .",
    "the absence of transient red or blueshifted components in the high resolution co spectra supports the suggestion that this gas evaporates from cometary bodies orbiting far ( several tens of au ) from the star .",
    "but the fact that the column density of co is only about 2% of the total column density of  in the @xmath22p ground term implies that photodissociation of this co is not the primary source for  gas .",
    "it could perhaps be produced directly from infalling comets close to the star , but the mechanism by which it comes to zero velocity relative to the star and accumulates before being photoionized is unclear ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "the ( @xmath5d )  gas may not have a stable component at 20 km s@xmath12 ; this unique species could prove to be a valuable tracer of feb activity in the @xmath0  pictoris  cs disk .    despite the advantages of this data set , our lack of success in modeling the heavily saturated  multiplets indicates that in order to really determine the characteristics of the variable components of the  gas , we need to observe an unsaturated line or multiplet , with an oscillator strength between that of the 1561   multiplet and that of the spin - forbidden 1613.376    line .",
    "a number of suitable multiplets and lines lie in the fuv , shortward of @xmath43 1300  .",
    "also , an unsaturated line arising from the @xmath5d level would allow us to confirm the velocity structure in this gas and to determine if the velocities of the @xmath5d gas components correspond with any of the velocities of the variable components in the @xmath22p gas .",
    "three likely lines lie between 1311   and 1359  .",
    "measurement of the densities of and would greatly help to unravel the carbon chemistry of the @xmath0  pictoris  disk . again , potentially useful multiplets of these species lie in the fuv below 1340  .",
    "thus , although this data set has vastly increased our knowledge about the important species  and co in the @xmath0  pictoris  disk , our understanding would probably benefit greatly from investigation of @xmath0  pictoris  at shorter ultraviolet wavelengths .",
