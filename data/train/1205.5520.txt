    "a seifert surface for an oriented knot or link @xmath2 is a compact connected oriented surface in @xmath5 with oriented boundary equal to @xmath2 .",
    "seifert s algorithm , wherein one takes an oriented projection of the link , cuts each crossing open in the manner that preserves orientation , fills in each resulting circle with a disk , and connects the disks with a half - twisted band at each crossing , ensures that such a surface exists .",
    "the minimal genus of a seifert surface is defined to be the genus of the knot or link . given a random link , it is typically difficult to determine its genus .",
    "however for one category of link , we have a simple means for finding the genus .    [ gabai]given an oriented alternating link , seifert s algorithm applied to a reduced alternating projection yields a minimal genus seifert surface .",
    "this theorem has been proven three times , first independently in 1958 by kunio murasugi @xcite and in 1959 by richard crowell @xcite using the reduced alexander polynomial , and then in 1987 by david gabai @xcite using elementary geometric techniques .",
    "our main theorem will include this theorem as a special case .",
    "however , in this paper , we will also be concerned with nonorientable spanning surfaces . the * crosscap number * of a nonorientable surface @xmath1 of @xmath6 boundary components",
    "is defined to be @xmath7 .",
    "note that this is the number of projective planes of which the corresponding closed surface is the connected sum . in @xcite , the * crosscap number of a link @xmath2 * is defined to be the minimum crosscap number of any nonorientable surface spanning the link @xmath2 .    for the sake of comparison between complexities of orientable and nonorientable surfaces",
    ", define the * nonorientable genus * of @xmath2 to be 1/2 of the crosscap number of @xmath2 .",
    "note that this can be either an integer or a half integer , and does not coincide with traditional definitions .",
    "we will sometimes refer to the genus of a knot or link as the orientable genus if confusion may otherwise arise .",
    "the crosscap number is known only for a relatively small collection of knots and links . in @xcite , it was determined for torus knots ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite , a simple method for its determination was provided for two - bridge knots and links . in @xcite , it was determined for many pretzel knots .    in this paper",
    ", we present a classification of spanning surfaces for alternating links up to genus , orientability , and a new invariant that we call aggregate slope , and that for knots coincides with the slope .",
    "that is , given an alternating link , we determine all possible combinations of genus , orientability , and aggregate slope that a surface spanning that link can have . to this end",
    ", we describe a straightforward algorithm , much like seifert s algorithm , through which to construct spanning surfaces .",
    "we call the surfaces generated by this algorithm * layered surfaces*. a particularly important subset of these will be what we call * basic layered surfaces*.    once we have a layered surface , we can also change the surface by performing the entirely local operations of adding handles and/or crosscaps , each of which increases genus .",
    "our main result , which appears in section 5 , is as follows :    given an alternating projection @xmath0 and a surface @xmath1 spanning @xmath2 , we can construct a surface @xmath3 spanning @xmath2 with the same genus , orientability , and aggregate slope as @xmath1 such that @xmath3 is a basic layered surface with respect to @xmath4 , except perhaps at a collection of added crosscaps and/or handles .",
    "when @xmath1 is orientable , @xmath3 can be chosen to be orientable with respect to the orientation that @xmath2 inherits from @xmath1 .",
    "this result has several useful corollaries that appear in section [ s : implications ] , including the already mentioned classification of spanning surfaces for alternating links .",
    "additionally , it allows us to easily find and construct a minimal nonorientable genus surface spanning a given alternating link .",
    "note , for example in @xcite , that a substantial amount of work is necessary to show the crosscap number of the link @xmath8 is 3 .",
    "theorem [ main ] and the algorithm given below make this an immediate conclusion . at the end of the paper , we include the nonorientable genus of all the alternating knots of nine or fewer crossings and alternating 2-component links of eight or fewer crossings",
    ". it would be straightforward to write a computer program to determine the nonorientable genus of all knots in the census of alternating knots through 22 crossings given in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , hatcher and thurston proved that a 2-bridge knot can not have two minimal nonorientable genus spanning surfaces , one boundary - incompressible and one boundary - compressible .",
    "they then asked whether or not this is true in general .",
    "we utilize the results of this paper to answer that question in the negative with a specific example .    in a recent paper ( cf .",
    "@xcite),curtis and taylor give a further corollary of theorem [ main ] , showing that the two checkerboard surfaces of a reduced alternating projection of an alternating knot must yield the maximum and minimum integral slopes for all essential boundary surfaces of the knot .",
    "this implies that these maximum and minimum integral slopes must be twice the number of positive crossings and the negative of twice the number of negative crossings in the projection respectively .",
    "since all slopes are integral for monesinos knots , this yields the maximum and minimum slopes for all surfaces in that case .",
    "the layered surfaces that appear here have independently been considered previously in @xcite ( see footnote on p.10 of the arxiv version ) and in @xcite , where they are called state surfaces and where a criterion is provided that proves certain such surfaces are essential .",
    "standard definitions of reduced projections , flypes , positive and negative crossings , oriented links , incompressible and boundary - incompressible surfaces apply . a surface that is incompressible _ and _ boundary - incompressible is said to be * essential*.    if a projection @xmath4 contains @xmath9 positive crossings and @xmath6 negative crossings , then the * writhe * @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",
    "writhe varies across projections of a given link and across orientations of a given projection , but is invariant across all reduced , alternating projections of an oriented link .",
    "we define the * aggregate linking number * @xmath12 to be the sum of the linking numbers of all pairs of link components .",
    "we define the aggregate linking number of a knot to be zero .",
    "equivalently , the aggregate linking number can be calculated in the same way as writhe , but only counting crossings between _ distinct _ link components , and halving at the end . linking number and aggregate linking number",
    "are invariant across all projections of a given oriented link , but may well vary across various orientations of a given link .",
    "a projection divides the projection surface @xmath13 into regions , each of whose boundary consists alternately of strands and crossings from @xmath2 . a region with @xmath6 crossings on its boundary",
    "will be called a * projection n - gon*.    a * spanning surface * for a link @xmath2 is a surface @xmath14 with boundary equal to @xmath2 such that @xmath15 consists of one @xmath16-curve on each component of @xmath17 , where @xmath9 refers to the number of meridians .",
    "we will not distinguish between the spanning surface @xmath1 as a subset of @xmath5 and the spanning surface as a subset of @xmath18 , calling both @xmath1 .",
    "two spanning surfaces for @xmath2 are considered equivalent if one is ambient isotopic to the other in @xmath18 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath1 contains no closed components , so that every point in @xmath1 is connected to @xmath2 by a path in @xmath1 .",
    "we need a special form of boundary - incompressibility for spanning surfaces .",
    "a spanning surface @xmath1 in @xmath18 is * meridianally boundary - compressible * if there exists a disk @xmath19 embedded in @xmath18 such that @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are both arcs , @xmath23 does not cut a disk off @xmath1 , @xmath24 cuts @xmath25 into two arcs @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a meridian of the knot for at least one of @xmath29 .",
    "a spanning surface is said to be * meridianally boundary - incompressible * if no such disk exists .",
    "the spanning surface is said to be * meridianally essential * if it is incompressible and meridianally boundary - incompressible .",
    "the * boundary slope * or just * slope * @xmath30 of a spanning surface @xmath1 with respect to a particular oriented component @xmath31 of the link it spans is the linking number of @xmath31 with @xmath32 , its parallel curve on @xmath1 ( where @xmath33 inherits the orientation of @xmath31 , as we will henceforth assume it to do )",
    ". the * aggregate slope * @xmath34 of a surface @xmath1 spanning oriented link @xmath2 is the sum of the link components individual slopes .",
    "note that slope and aggregate slope are independent of link orientation .",
    "we define the * twist * of a spanning surface @xmath1 relative to projection @xmath4 to be @xmath35 , where @xmath34 is the aggregate slope , @xmath10 is the writhe , and @xmath12 is the aggregate linking number of @xmath2 .",
    "the twist @xmath36 can be calculated by taking the projection of @xmath37 and considering only those crossings that occur between edges of the annuli in @xmath38 .",
    "if we have @xmath9 positive crossings of this type and @xmath6 negative crossings , then @xmath39 .    first , notice that @xmath38 is a collection of annuli .",
    "holding @xmath2 fixed , we can isotope each annulus in @xmath38 so that in the projection of @xmath37 , any crossing between some component of @xmath40 and its respective boundary through an annulus in @xmath38 _ does not _ occur in a neighborhood of a crossing of @xmath2 in the projection .",
    "the projection of @xmath37 will then have the following seven types of crossings , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote any distinct pair of link components and @xmath43 and @xmath44 their respective components in @xmath45 :    \\(i ) @xmath41 with itself    \\(ii ) @xmath41 with @xmath42    \\(iii ) @xmath41 with @xmath43 , such that the pre - image of the crossing is an arc connecting the two boundary components of the annulus @xmath46",
    "\\(iv ) @xmath41 with @xmath43 in a neighborhood of a crossing of @xmath2 , rather than through @xmath46    \\(v ) @xmath43 with itself , necessarily in the neighborhood of a crossing of @xmath2 .",
    "\\(vi ) @xmath41 with @xmath44 , necessarily in the neighborhood of a crossing of @xmath2 .",
    "\\(vii ) @xmath43 with @xmath44 , necessarily in the neighborhood of a crossing of @xmath2 .",
    "notice , as in figure [ fi : crossing ] , that the neighborhood of each type i crossing will also contain exactly two type iv crossings and one type v crossing , each of the same type ( positive or negative ) .",
    "the same will also be true of types ii , vi , and vii , respectively .",
    "we then obtain the following expression for aggregate slope , where @xmath47 denotes the number of positive type i crossings minus the number of negative ones , and similarly for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51    rearranging gives :    @xmath52    as desired .",
    "we also use this classification of the seven types of crossings in @xmath53 to prove the following .",
    "any spanning surface has an even aggregate slope .",
    "we proceed by induction on euler characteristic , and assume @xmath1 to be connected , spanning @xmath2 ( we can easily generalize to disconnected surfaces ) . if @xmath54 , @xmath1 is a disk , so aggregate slope is zero .",
    "assume the proposition is true for @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 .",
    "find an arc @xmath57 on @xmath1 such that @xmath58 is connected , spanning a link @xmath59 .",
    "since @xmath60 , it must have an even aggregate slope , by our inductive hypothesis .",
    "now , isotope @xmath1 and @xmath2 to shorten @xmath57 , changing the projection to give the picture in figure [ fi : band ] .",
    "call the resulting projection of the link @xmath4 .    cutting along",
    "@xmath61 will not create any new crossings , so any change in aggregate slope will result from positive crossings becoming negative crossings or vice - versa , as a result of changes in orientation . since @xmath31 will inherit the orientation of @xmath2 , all positive type iii crossings will remain positive , and all negative type iii crossings will remain negative . the only other crossings that contribute to aggregate slope are type iv crossings , but each type iv crossing will appear as in figure [ fi : crossing ] , from which it follows that any change in the orientation of type iv crossings will increase or decrease the aggregate slope by exactly two .",
    "therefore , if @xmath62 is even , then @xmath34 will be as well , proving our statement .",
    "although writhe and linking number may vary with the orientation of a link , the slope , aggregate slope , and twist will not .",
    "slope , aggregate slope , and linking number are invariant across all projections of isotopic embeddings of a given surface @xmath1 spanning a given oriented link @xmath2 , but writhe and twist are not .",
    "writhe and twist are invariant across all projections of isotopic embeddings of @xmath1 in which @xmath2 has a given orientation and is in reduced , alternating form .",
    "isotopy of @xmath1 does not change the identity of the link @xmath37 , and since linking number is invariant across all projections , slope , aggregate slope , and linking number are invariant across all projected embeddings of @xmath1 . adding a half - twist to @xmath0 alters the writhe , and the twist as well , since @xmath63 . because writhe is invariant under flyping ,",
    "it is invariant across all reduced , alternating projections of an oriented link @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , twist is as well .",
    "note that compression increases @xmath64 by two , and boundary compression increases @xmath64 by one .    a meridianal boundary - compression of a spanning surface yields another spanning surface .",
    "suppose that surface @xmath1 spans link @xmath2 and that @xmath19 is a meridianal boundary - compression disk",
    ". then @xmath65 and @xmath20 where @xmath66 for some link component @xmath31 and @xmath67 .",
    "note that @xmath57 intersects @xmath1 only at its endpoints , and that @xmath68 consists of two arcs sharing the endpoints of @xmath57 .",
    "we see then that we can isotope @xmath19 through @xmath69 , with its boundary moving across @xmath70 , such that we obtain the general picture of a meridianal boundary compression shown in figure [ compression ] ( in fact , there are two possible pictures of a mertidianal boundary compression , the second being the reflection of the one shown in the figure ) .    performing the boundary compression amounts to cutting @xmath1 along @xmath71 , and then gluing in two parallel copies of @xmath19 .",
    "the picture shows that this yields a spanning surface , whose slope along @xmath31 differs from that of @xmath1 by @xmath72 .",
    "note that the meridianal boundary compression yields another spanning surface with slope that has increased or decreased by exactly two , while compression leaves the slope unchanged .",
    "since neither compression nor meridianal boundary compression affects the writhe or linking number of an oriented projection , meridianal boundary compression increases or decreases twist by exactly two and compression leaves twist unchanged .",
    "seifert s algorithm for producing a seifert surface for an arbitrary link need not generate a minimal genus seifert surface , as the example in figure [ fi : compress ] demonstrates .",
    "however , theorem [ gabai ] shows that it does when the link is alternating .",
    "one would like to obtain a similar result in the case of nonorientable spanning surfaces , so it is worth considering gabai s method of proof .",
    "first , he shows that given orientable surfaces @xmath1 and @xmath3 , each spanning an oriented link @xmath2 , with @xmath73 , there exists an orientable surface @xmath74 with smaller genus than @xmath1 such that _ _ @xmath75 _ _ _ _ @xmath76 .",
    "second , he takes a surface @xmath1 obtained by applying seifert s algorithm to an @xmath6-crossing oriented link and assumes there exists an orientable spanning surface of smaller genus .",
    "he then uses the earlier result to construct a surface @xmath3 of smaller genus than @xmath1 , where the two are disjoint in their interiors .",
    "he then uses this structure to find arcs on @xmath1 and @xmath3 that are parallel to the same crossing , and he cuts along each .",
    "this reduces by one the crossing number of their shared boundary and increases by one each surface s euler characteristic .",
    "he now has surfaces @xmath77 and @xmath74 spanning an @xmath78-crossing alternating link , where @xmath77 comes from seifert s algorithm and @xmath79 . from here",
    ", he applies an inductive argument on crossing number and reaches a contradiction .",
    "the proof is elegantly elementary but fails to generalize to nonorientable surfaces because of the following .",
    "no two spanning surfaces of the same link , at least one of which is nonorientable , can be disjoint in their interiors .    given two surfaces disjoint in their interiors , spanning the same link , they must have the same boundary slopes .",
    "we can then connect their two boundaries with an annulus in @xmath80 to obtain a single , closed surface without boundary , embedded in 3-space .",
    "if either spanning surface is nonorientable , then the closed surface will be as well .",
    "since no closed , nonorientable surface can be embedded in 3-space , we have a contradiction .",
    "before discussing nonorientability further , we present one more useful fact .",
    "suppose a surface @xmath1 spans an oriented link @xmath2 .",
    "for any arc @xmath81 , with both endpoints on @xmath2 , @xmath82 will take one of the forms pictured in figure [ fi : orientbands ] .",
    "we will call the former a * de - orienting band * and the latter an * orienting band*.    a surface @xmath1 spanning @xmath2 is orientable if and only if it is possible to orient @xmath2 so that @xmath1 contains no de - orienting bands .",
    "equivalently , @xmath1 is nonorientable if and only if @xmath1 contains a de - orienting band under any orientation of @xmath2 .",
    "if a surface is orientable , its boundary inherits an orientation from an orientation of the entire surface .",
    "the existence of a de - orienting band would contradict the orientation inherited by the boundary .",
    "conversely , if the surface is non - orientable it contains a mobius band .",
    "let @xmath83 be the core curve of this mobius band and let @xmath84 , @xmath85 be arcs with one endpoint on @xmath23 and the other on @xmath2 .",
    "the endpoints of @xmath84 and @xmath86 on @xmath23 divide it in two .",
    "let @xmath87 and @xmath88 be these two arcs of @xmath23 , as in figure [ fi : mobius ]",
    ".    then under any orientation of @xmath2 either @xmath89 or @xmath90 will be a de - orienting band",
    ".    this will be an important fact in the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "as for the matter at hand , we say that a spanning surface @xmath1 is orientable _ relative _ to its oriented boundary link @xmath2 if @xmath2 is oriented in the way guaranteed by the above result . note that any orientable surface @xmath1 can be oriented ( assigned a normal direction ) in two ways , and each of these orientations defines an orientation on its link boundary , @xmath2 .",
    "these orientations of @xmath2 are precisely the ones relative to which @xmath1 is oriented .",
    "the example in figure [ fi : annulus ] may be useful in seeing how this distinction is important for theorem [ main ] , since this surface is orientable ( it contains no mobius band ) but _ not _ relative to its oriented boundary ( it contains de - orienting bands ) .",
    "in @xcite , checkerboard surfaces generated from reduced , alternating projections were shown to be essential , non - accidental , and non - fibered and therefore quasi - fuchsian surfaces in hyperbolic link complements .",
    "we seek to describe a larger class of essential , non - accidental , nonorientable surfaces spanning these links .",
    "since fibers must be orientable , any such surfaces must be quasi - fuchsian .",
    "to this end , we devised the following natural extension of seifert s algorithm , which we call the layered surface algorithm , as depicted in figure [ fi : layered ] .",
    "\\(1 ) beginning with an alternating projection @xmath0 , split open each crossing in one of the two directions .",
    "\\(2 ) this will result in a collection of non - overlapping , possibly nested circles .",
    "choose a region on the projection sphere to contain @xmath91 .",
    "put nested circles at different heights relative to @xmath13 and fill each circle with a disk to the side that does not contain @xmath91 when projected to @xmath13 .",
    "\\(3 ) connect the disks with half - twist bands at the crossings , yielding a surface with boundary equal to the link such that the link projects to @xmath0 , as in seifert s algorithm , if it is possible to do so without a crossing band intersecting an existing disk .",
    "if this is not possible , change the heights of the disks so that the disks can be connected with crossing bands .    not all choices of relative disk heights can generate a layered surface , as the crossing band between two disks might intersect a third disk .",
    "it is always possible , though , to choose heights for the disks to generate a layered surface , most simply by stacking all inner disks ( disks with boundary circles inside boundary circles of other disks ) above outer ones .",
    "note that while different choices of relative heights for nested circles may well generate distinct layered surfaces , the choices of disk heights will not affect euler characteristic , orientability , or aggregate slope .",
    "layered surfaces that have a crossing band that connects a circle to itself are often boundary - compressible ( in fact , meridianally boundary - compressible ) . to avoid this issue",
    ", we define a * basic layered surface * to be one that does not have a crossing band connecting a circle to itself . for our purposes ,",
    "the only layered surfaces with which we will be concerned are basic layered surfaces . in a subsequent paper ,",
    "we plan to discuss the questions of essentiality and non - accidentality of these surfaces .",
    "the greatest initial evidence that _ something like _ theorem [ main ] might be true was that for small crossing number ( all of the knots are 2-bridges ) , layered surfaces seemed to match up perfectly ( at least according to genus , orientability and boundary - slope ) with hatcher and thurston s surfaces from @xcite , which they proved to be a complete classification of essential surfaces spanning these knots .    in 1991 ,",
    "w. menasco and m. thistlethwaite used menasco s geometric structure to prove tait s flyping conjecture ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , which states that any two reduced , alternating projections of the same link are related through a finite sequence of flypes .",
    "let us consider what happens to layered surfaces under flyping .",
    "given a layered surface @xmath1 generated from an alternating projection @xmath4 and a flype that takes @xmath4 to projection @xmath92 , there exists a layered surface @xmath77 obtained from @xmath92 with the same genus , orientability , and aggregate slope as @xmath1 , where @xmath77 is a basic layered surface if and only if @xmath1 is .    see figure [ fi : flypes ] .",
    "we have eight possible situations , depending on the crossing splits .",
    "after splitting , there are two possibilities for the single crossing ; it can be split vertically or horizontally .",
    "after splitting in t , there are two possibilities",
    ". it could be the case that c shares a circle with d and e shares a circle with f. or it could be that c shares a circle with e and d shares a circle with f. finally , there are two possibilities for the splittings outside this part of the projection .",
    "either a is connected to e and b to f , or a is connected to b and e to f. three of the eight possibilities yield figures equivalent to three others , yielding five figures to consider . for each",
    ", we perform a flype about the tangle @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath1 is layered , @xmath1 is layered both inside and outside of @xmath3 . in each case",
    ", we can obtain a surface after the flype with the same genus , orientability and aggregate slope as the original surface .",
    "note that the original and resulting surface are either both basic or neither basic . also note that the last two cases are never basic layered surfaces and always nonorientable .",
    "so any two alternating projections of the same link generate equivalent collections of layered surfaces , up to genus , orientability and aggregate slope .    for our next fact ,",
    "notice that in the construction of a layered surface we have two options in the splitting of each crossing , which we will call a and b splits , as in figure [ fi : splits ] .",
    "as is standard(cf.@xcite , chapter 6 ) , the regions adjacent to a crossing can be labelled a and b depending on whether we twist the top strand counterclockwise or clockwise to cover those regions",
    ". the a or b - split corresponds to creating a channel between the two regions with that label at the crossing .",
    "suppose that the construction of a layered surface @xmath1 involves @xmath93 a - splits and @xmath94 b - splits .",
    "then @xmath95 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath96 .",
    "recall that @xmath36 can be calculated just by counting the net total of positive and negative crossings between @xmath2 and @xmath40 through annuli in @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath1 is layered , we may have some pairs of crossings that appear as in figure [ fi : bend ] , but each pair will have no net effect on @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath1 is layered , the only other crossings between @xmath2 and @xmath97 through annuli in @xmath38 will occur at crossings ( exactly why this is true will become more apparent when we introduce the menasco structure , although it should seem believable from our pictures so far ) .",
    "the neighborhood of each a - split crossing in @xmath0 will contain two positive crossings between @xmath2 and @xmath97 through an annulus in @xmath38 , and the neighborhood of each b - split crossing will contain two negative crossings of this type .",
    "thus , @xmath98 .",
    "that @xmath99 then follows from the definition of @xmath36 .",
    "note that a layered surface constructed from an @xmath6-crossing projection in which the crossing splits produce @xmath100 circles will have an euler characteristic of @xmath101 .",
    "suppose we want to find a minimal genus layered surface for a given projection .",
    "we could compare the genera of all @xmath102 possible surfaces , but we would like to do better than this . instead , we can employ the following :    \\(1 ) find the smallest @xmath103 for which the projection contains a projection @xmath103-gon .",
    "( 2a ) if @xmath104 , choose a projection @xmath103-gon and split each crossing on this region s boundary so that this region becomes a circle .",
    "( 2b ) if @xmath105 ( and therefore @xmath106 , by a simple euler characteristic argument on the projection plane ) , choose a projection @xmath107-gon . from here , create two branches of our algorithm , each of which will ultimately yield a layered surface .",
    "we will later choose to follow the branch that produced the smaller genus surface and to ignore the other .",
    "for one of these branches , we split each crossing on this projection @xmath107-gon s boundary so that it becomes a circle . for the other branch",
    ", we split each of these three crossings the opposite way .",
    "\\(3 ) repeat until each branch reaches a projection without crossings . of all constructed surfaces , choose the one with the smallest genus .",
    "the minimal genus algorithm always generates a minimal genus layered surface spanning a given alternating link .",
    "note , however , that the resulting surface is not necessarily uniquely determined by this algorithm .",
    "( by induction on crossings in @xmath4 . )",
    "the statement is trivial for zero crossings .",
    "suppose it is true for fewer than @xmath6 crossings , and let @xmath4 be an @xmath6-crossing projection .",
    "suppose that performing this algorithm on @xmath4 generates a layered surface @xmath1 spanning @xmath2 .",
    "also , let @xmath3 be a minimal genus layered surface spanning @xmath2 ; then @xmath108 for any layered surface @xmath109 spanning @xmath2 . we want to show that @xmath110 , or equivalently that @xmath111 , where @xmath100 is the number of circles used in the construction of each respective layered surface .",
    "first suppose that @xmath4 contains a projection @xmath112-gon or @xmath113-gon .",
    "let @xmath114 be the one around which all crossings are split in the construction of @xmath1 , via our algorithm .",
    "also , suppose for contradiction that @xmath115 .",
    "we construct a new layered surface , @xmath74 , with the exact same crossing splits as in the construction of @xmath3 , except that the crossing splits around @xmath114 coincide with the corresponding crossing splits for @xmath1 .",
    "note that if the crossing splits of @xmath1 and @xmath3 already coincide here , we will have @xmath116 .",
    "figure [ fi : bigon ] demonstrates that @xmath117 .",
    "note that the first , third and fourth cases depicted cause a decrease in the number of circles if the crossing splits are switched , while in the second case , the number of circles may either decrease or be preserved .",
    "we then have an @xmath78- or @xmath118-crossing projection where our algorithm yields @xmath119 circles and where the construction of @xmath74 , another layered surface , yields a projection of @xmath120 circles .",

    "a spanning surface for the trivial knot can be thought of as a surface properly embedded in a solid torus @xmath208 , which is the complement of the trivial knot .",

    "[ fi : gluingorientations ] ( a ) , we can extend the orientation on @xmath223 to an orientation on @xmath2 , and we can assign a normal direction to the crossing band as we glue it back in that agrees with the normal direction on both @xmath222 and @xmath228 to both sides of the crossing .",
    "thus , both @xmath77 and @xmath74 will be orientable with respect to this orientation on @xmath2 , as will @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , as in the case depicted in figure [ fi : gluingorientations ] ( b ) , if we were to glue in an _ untwisted _ band to both @xmath222 and to @xmath228 as appears in figure [ fi : gluingorientations ] ( c ) , we would obtain a pair of orientable surfaces .",
    "corollary [ cor : connected ] implies that each such surface contains an annulus that passes through this untwisted band once .",
    "replacing the untwisted band with the actual crossing band to obtain @xmath77 and @xmath74 will result in the fact each contains a mobius band , implying that both @xmath77 and @xmath74 are nonorientable , and therefore implying the same for @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "thus , we have proven that our inductive construction preserves orientability as well as euler characteristic and aggregate slope .",
    "all we have left to show is that our layered surface @xmath3 can be a _",
    "basic _ layered surface ( potentially with added crosscaps or handles ) , one in which no crossing connects a circle to itself .",
    "suppose @xmath3 is a non - basic layered surface such that in its construction , we stacked all inner disks above outer ones , as described earlier",
    ". @xmath3 is then meridianally boundary - compressible . performing this meridianal boundary compression",
    "will take @xmath3 to a layered surface in which fewer crossings connect any circle to itself than in @xmath3 . performing in turn all possible meridianal boundary compressions of this sort and pairing each with the addition of an appropriate crosscap",
    "will create a new layered surface ( with added crosscaps and perhaps handles as well ) that is in fact basic and that has the same euler characteristic , aggregate slope , and orientability as @xmath3 and therefore as @xmath1 .",
    "we now provide some corollaries to theorem [ main ] .    given an alternating projection of a link , the minimal genus basic layered surface ( orientable or nonorientable ) generated from that projection is a minimal genus spanning surface for that link .",
    "if a minimal genus basic layered surface is nonorientable , it realizes the nonorientable genus for the link .",
    "if all minimal genus basic layered surfaces are orientable , the nonorientable genus is 1/2 greater than this minimal genus .",

    "@xmath1 can be orientable if and only if such a @xmath3 is orientable and @xmath240 .",
    "note that in @xcite , the authors point out that no example is known of two mutant knots with distinct crosscap number , unlike what occurs for orientable genus , where the kinoshita - terasaka mutants provide just such an example .",
    "it is known that for alternating knots and links , orientable genus is preserved by mutation",
    ".    if a knot is alternating , any mutant of it has the same crosscap number as it does .",
    "this follows from theorem [ main ] together with the fact that a mutant of an alternating knot is also alternating , and must come from a sequence of mutations .",
    "each of the mutations is along a 4-punctured sphere that intersects the projection plane in either a single circle intersecting the knot at four points or in two circles , each intersecting the knot at two points such that the sphere has two saddles .",
    "this follows from @xcite .",
    "the collection of genera paired with orientability of spanning surfaces of the knot is preserved by mutancy along such 4-punctured spheres .    in @xcite ,",

    "they ask whether or not this is true in general .",
    "we answer that question in the negative with the following example .",
    "* example . *",
    "consider the knot and surfaces that appear in figure [ fi : knot ] . by applying the algorithm of section [ sec : layered ] ,",
    "we find that a spanning surface @xmath1 with greatest possible euler characteristic is orientable of genus 2 , and therefore the nonorientable genus is 5/2 , a surface for which can be obtained by adding a crosscap to the surface @xmath1 .",
    "this surface @xmath124 , which appears at the top of figure [ fi : knot ] , is incompressible , as any compression would yield a spanning surface with genus less than the minimum 2 , and it is obviously boundary - compressible .",
    "however , we can also obtain the second surface @xmath125 appearing in figure [ fi : knot ] by sliding one strand around the far side of the projection sphere and changing one crossing split .",
    "it is a non - basic layered surface . by situating the bands connecting top and bottom to be alternately over and under the main disk ,",
    "we obtain a surface that is boundary - incompressible .    the surface @xmath125 is incompressible and boundary - incompressible .",
    "that the surface is incompressible follows immediately from the fact that a compression would yield a spanning surface of genus less than 2 , contradicting the fact that 2 is the minimal genus possible for this knot . to see that it is boundary - incompressible , we intersect it with a sphere @xmath199 intersecting the projection plane in the circle shown in figure [ fi : boundary ] .",
    "suppose @xmath125 is boundary compressible .",
    "we can choose a boundary - compressing disk @xmath19 so that the two points of intersection of its boundary with @xmath241 occur at or very near the point @xmath174 in the figure and so that it intersects @xmath199 in a minimal number of components .",
    "then , an outermost intersection arc of @xmath242 on @xmath19 cuts a disk @xmath243 from @xmath19 , the boundary of which is made up of an arc in @xmath199 and an arc in @xmath244 .",
    "this implies that to one of the sides of @xmath199 , the interior of this disk @xmath243 lies in the interior of a handlebody @xmath245 obtained by removing @xmath246 from one of the balls bounded by @xmath199 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath243 consists of a single arc in @xmath199 and a second arc , for which there are three cases .",
    "the second arc is either entirely contained in @xmath125 , entirely contained in @xmath247 , or it is made up of two arcs , one in @xmath125 and one in @xmath247 . because the fundamental group of a handlebody is a free product , in the first two cases",
    ", the arc in @xmath248 can not pass over either of the two bands formed from the triple half - twists without immediately turning around and retracing its path , and it must therefore be isotopic on @xmath249 to a path that passes directly from left to right , beginning and ending on @xmath199 .",
    "however , the two twisted bands prevent such an arc from being isotopic into @xmath199 while fixing its endpoints .    in the third case , the fact we can only jump once from @xmath125 to @xmath247 as we travel around @xmath250 and those jumps occur in the vicinity of the point a , again implies that the triple twisting of the two bands prevents the arc @xmath248 from traversing one of the triple - twisted bands .",
    "again , the arc must must be isotopic on @xmath249 to a path that passes directly from left to right , beginning and ending on @xmath199,the twisted bands of which again prevent it from being isotopic into @xmath199 while fixing its endpoints , thereby proving @xmath125 is boundary - incompressible .",
