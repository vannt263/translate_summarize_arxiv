    "during the second half of last century and continuing through the present , random matrix theory has grown from a special method of theoretical physics , meant to approximate energy levels of complex nuclei @xcite , into a vast mathematical theory with many different application in physics , computer and electrical engineering .",
    "simply describing all the developments and methods currently employed in this context would result in a monography much more extensive than this review .",
    "therefore , we will only briefly mention topics which are themselves very interesting , but lie beyond the scope of this work .    the applications of random matrix theory ( rmt ) into physics have been extended from the original subject , spectra of heavy nuclei , to descriptions of large @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theory @xcite , critical statistical models in two dimensions @xcite disordered electronic systems @xcite , quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) @xcite , to name only a few .",
    "non - physics applications range from communication theory @xcite to stochastic processes out of equilibrium @xcite and even more exotic topics @xcite .",
    "a number of important results , both at theoretical and applied levels , were obtained from the connection between random matrices and orthogonal polynomials , especially in their weighted limit @xcite .",
    "these works explored the relationship between the branch cuts of spectral ( riemann ) curves of systems of differential equations and the support of limit measures for weighted orthogonal polynomials .",
    "yet another interesting connection stemming from this approach is with the general ( matrix ) version of the riemann - hilbert problem with finite support @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", it was showed that such relationships also hold for the class of normal random matrices .",
    "unlike in previous works , for this ensemble , the support of the equilibrium distribution for the eigenvalues of matrices in the infinite - size limit , is two - dimensional , which allows to interpret it as a growing cluster in the plane .",
    "thus , a direct relation to the class of models known as laplacian growth ( both in the deterministic and stochastic formulations ) , was derived , with important consequences . in particular , this approach allowed to study formation of singularities in models of two - dimensional growth . moreover , these results allowed to define a proper way of continuing the solution for singular laplacian growth , beyond the critical point .    from the point of view of the dimensionality of the support for random matrix eigenvalues , it is possible to distinguish between 1-dimensional situations ( which characterize 1 and 2-matrix models ) , and 2-dimensional situations , like in the case of normal random matrix theory .",
    "in fact , very recent results point to intermediate cases , where the support is a set of dimensional between 1 and 2 .",
    "this situation is very similar to the description of disordered , interacting electrons in the plane , in the vicinity of the critical point which separates localized from de - localized behavior @xcite .",
    "it is from the perspective of the dimensionality of support for equilibrium measure that we have organized this review .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way : after a brief summary of the main concepts in section  [ first ] , we explain the structure of normal random matrices in the limit of infinite size , in section  [ second ] .",
    "this allows to connect with planar growth models , of which laplacian ( or harmonic ) growth is a main representative .",
    "the following two sections give a solid description of the physical ( section  [ third ] ) and mathematical ( section  [ fourth ] ) structure of harmonic growth .",
    "the discretized ( or quantized ) version of this problem is precisely given by normal random matrices , as we indicate in these sections .",
    "next we present a general scheme for encoding shade functions in the plane into linear data , specifically into a linear bounded hilbert space operator @xmath2 with rank one self - commutator @xmath3 = 1 $ ] .",
    "this line of research goes back to the perturbation and scattering theory of symmetric operators ( m. g. krein s phase shift function ) and to studies related to singular integral operators with a cauchy kernel type singularity .",
    "multivariate refinements of the `` quantization scheme '' we outline in chapter 5 lie at the foundations of both cyclic ( co)homology of operator algebras and of free probability theory . in view of the scope and length of the present survey",
    ", we confine ourselves to only outline the surprising link between quadrature domains and such hilbert space objects .",
    "we conclude with an application of the operator formalism to the description of boundary singular points that are characteristic to laplacian growth evolution , and a brief overview of other related topics .",
    "following @xcite , we reproduce the standard introduction of the symmetry - groups ensemble of random matrices . the traditional ensembles ( orthogonal , unitary and symplectic )",
    "were introduced mainly because of their significance with respect to symmetries of hamiltonian operators in physical theories : time - reversal and rotational invariance corresponds to the orthogonal ensemble ( which , for gaussian measures , is naturally abbreviated goe ) , while time - reversal alone and rotational invariance alone correspond to the symplectic and unitary ensembles , respectively ( gse and gue for gaussian measures ) .",
    "an invariant measure is defined for each of these ensembles , in the form d ( m ) p(m ) d ( m ) z^-1 e^-tr[w(m ) ] d ( m ) , where @xmath4 is a matrix from the ensemble , @xmath5 is a normalization factor ( partition function ) , tr@xmath6 $ ] is invariant under the symmetries on the ensemble , and @xmath7 is the appropriate flat measure for that ensemble : @xmath8 for orthogonal , @xmath9 for unitary , and @xmath10 for symplectic ( where each matrix element is an element of the real klein group , @xmath11 ) . correspondingly , to each of these ensembles , a parameter @xmath12 , indicating the number of independent real parameters necessary to describe the pair of values @xmath13 , is introduced , with values @xmath14 for orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ensembles , respectively .",
    "the invariance under transformations from the appropriate symmetry group leads to the following simplification of the measure : for any of these ensembles , the generic matrix @xmath4 can be diagonalized by a transformation @xmath15 , with @xmath16 from the same group , and @xmath17 .",
    "the jacobian of the transformation @xmath18 ( where @xmath16 is said to carry the  angular \" degrees of freedom of @xmath4 ) is @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the vandermonde determinant .",
    "the angular degrees of freedom can be integrated out ( a trivial redefinition of the normalization factor ) , giving the simplified measure ( _ 1 ,  , _",
    "n)_i=1^n d_i = z^-1 e^tr[w ( ) ] |()|^ _",
    "i=1^n d_i for example , in the case of gaussian measure @xmath21 , the joint probability distribution function of eigenvalues , @xmath22 , becames ( up to normalization ) ( _ 1 ,  , _",
    "n ) = clearly , this procedure is useful only if we are interested in computing expectation values of quantities which depend only of the distribution of eigenvalues , and not of the angular degrees of freedom .",
    "this is indeed the case for all situations of interest .    the next standard transformation ( which we discuss for the case of unitary ensemble , @xmath23 ) that is performed on the measure uses the well - known property of vandermonde determinant @xmath24_{1 \\le i , j \\le n}$ ] . because of standard determinantal identities , this is equivalent with replacing each monomial @xmath25 by a _ monic",
    "_ polynomial of the same order , @xmath26 .",
    "finally , these polynomials may be chosen to be orthogonal with respect to the measure @xmath27 , giving for the p.d.f .",
    "of eigenvalues the expression ( _ 1 ,  , _",
    "n ) = ||^2 , which is simply the absolute value - squared of the wavefunction of the ground state for @xmath0 electrons in the external potential @xmath28 . as we shall see , this kind o physical interpretation may be generalized to the case of matrix ensembles with two - dimensional support of eigenvalues .",

    "ensembles of matrices which may be reduced to a tridiagonal form ( instead of standard diagonal ) by a transformation which eliminates  angular \" degrees of freedom , were introduced in @xcite . as an interesting consequence ,",
    "many results carry over to this case , while the parameter @xmath12 is allowed to take any positive real value .      in this section",
    "we explain how , using properly chosen non - gaussian measures , it is possible to construct ensembles of hermitian matrices ( corresponding again to the unitary symmetry ) which are in a sense , critical , i.e. for which a continuum limit ( @xmath29 ) may be defined .",
    "the discussion relies on the formulation based on orthogonal polynomials indicated above , and it follows ( at a more elementary level ) the general theory of saff and totik @xcite .",

    "the first non - trivial example is a quartic polynomial of the type w(x ) = -(x^2 + g x^4 ) , g > 0 , for which the deformation in not a simple rescaling . in this case , it is possible to consider a special limit @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a constant .",
    "as we will see , for a specific value of @xmath41 , this limit yields a special asymptotic behavior of the orthonormal functions @xmath42 .",
    "however , even for the simplest , trivial monomial ( a gaussian ) , which yields the hermite polynomials , the asymptotic behavior of the orthogonal functions is non - trivial , in the sense that there are no known good approximations for the case @xmath43 .",

    "the applications of this theory to planar growth processes will be discussed in the following two chapters .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion on the oldest and simplest ensemble of random matrices with planar support .",
    "the ensemble of complex , @xmath96 random matrices with identical , independent , zero - mean gaussian - distributed entries , was first studied by j. ginibre in 1965 @xcite , and then it was generalized for non - zero mean gaussian by girko in 1985 @xcite .",

    "this is known as the circular law .",
    "if the exponent of the pure gaussian is perturbed by a quadratic term , the result holds for a corresponding elliptical domain , giving the elliptical law . the same limiting curves ( circular and elliptical ) describe the graph of the distribution of @xmath100 eigenvalues for hermitian ensembles , with pure and perturbed gaussian measures .",
    "in that case , the laws are known as wigner - dyson @xcite and marchenko - pastur , respectively ( although the last one was originally derived for covariance matrices built from sparse regression matrices @xcite ) .",
    "extensions and exceptions from the circular and elliptical laws were found by relaxing the conditions of the theorems . in particular ,",
    "deviations from uniformity for angular statistics in the case of gaussian measure were derived in @xcite , while the case of heavy - tails distributions was investigated in @xcite and subsequent publications .",
    "a special case of matrices with complex eigenvalues is given by @xmath101 matrices .",

    "the preceding chapters provide a review of the relationships between the theory of normal random matrices , where evolution is defined by increasing the size of the matrix ( a discrete time ) , its continuum ( or infinite size ) limit - laplacian growth - and the general theory of semi - normal operators whose spectrum approximates generic domains .",

    "the details of the transition from conductive to insulating behavior for a system of interacting 2d electrons , in the presence of disorder , referred to as metal - insulator transition ( or mit ) are not well understood , despite decades of research . here",
    "we give a very sketchy description of this problem , in order to illustrate the mathematical essence of the model and of the difficulties , and we refer the reader to one of the several excellent monographs on the subject @xcite .",
    "the fact that a system of electrons may  jam \" , i.e. behave like an insulator , because of either strong interactions ( mott transition ) or strong disorder ( anderson transition ) has been known for roughly half a century .",
    "however , creating a theoretical model which could incorporate both interactions and disorder in a proper fashion , was difficult to achieve .",
    "the foundation for our current formulation of this problem was laid by wegner @xcite , and later improved by efetov @xcite .",
    "a very clear exposition of this formulation can be found in the synopsis @xcite .    in its simplest formulation ,",
    "the model consists of a lattice in @xmath1197dimensions ( which may be taken to be @xmath1198 ) , where to each vertex corresponds an @xmath1199dimensional vector space of states ( also called orbitals ) , and with hamiltonian @xmath1200 where the state @xmath1201 depends on position @xmath316 and orbital @xmath49 , @xmath1000 refers to the interaction between adjacent vertices and @xmath994 implements the disorder component , via the random matrix @xmath1202 , which can be hermitian , orthogonal , symplectic , etc . based on symmetries of the system .",
    "efetov s idea was to use supersymmetry to incorporate interactions and disorder on the same footing ; the method was later extended to implement the  hermitization \" of non - hermitian random matrices with non - gaussian weights , appearing in the same physical context @xcite .",
    "for rotationally invariant measures , the authors showed that the distribution of eigenvalues can be either a disc or an annulus , and that there is a phase transition between the two , as a function of model parameters .",
    "the difficulties related to this formulation of the problem are due to the fact that the transition can not be described within the established models of phase transitions . in all these models ,",
    "the state of the system is obtained by minimization of a proper thermodynamic potential ( for instance , free energy ) , or equivalently , finding the points of extrema of action in a path - integral approach ( via a saddle - point condition ) .",
    " proper \" phase transitions are characterized by potentials that are globally convex , so that the minimization problem is well - defined .",
    "however , the supersymmetric formulation of mit does not lead to a true extremum , but rather a saddle - point , due to the non - compact , hyperbolic geometry structure of the effective theory ( @xmath1203 in the simplest case ) .",
    "the interested reader can find a detailed exposition of this phenomenon in @xcite , for example . in the case where the system has a finite scale",
    ", it can be shown , following efetov , that only the zero modes of the theory are important , which leads to an effective simplification in computing the multipoint correlation functions .",
    "however , the full model is still not solved for the 2d case , due to the difficulties pointed out above .    in a nutshell",
    ", we may summarize the problem as non - tractable using the standard statistical physics formulation of phase transitions . in that sense ,",
    "the situation is similar to another famous unsolved physical model , the disordered spin problem in the presence of magnetic field , where determination of the ground state is a task of exponential complexity ( with respect to the size of the system ) .",
    "the phase transition where the system goes from an ordered state to a state with local order but no long - range order ( a spin glass ) is equally intractable as mit , for the reasons explained .",
    "interestingly enough , both problems may be _ approximately _ studied using a physicist s approach notorious for its lack of control : the replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) @xcite .",
    "we mention it here mainly because of its statistical interpretation .    starting from the elementary observation @xmath1204 ,",
    "it is tempting to replace averages ( over disorder ) computed from the thermodynamic potential @xmath1205 , with averages computed with @xmath1206 , because of the implicit assumption that repeated products of the random variable @xmath5 will _ self - average _ ( an implicit application of the central limit theorem ) . by extension , one may assume that averages of products of operators , projected on special states , @xmath1207 ( correlation functions ) , may also be computed by the same argument .    in this ( statistical inference ) approach , the failure of standard descriptions of phase transitions is related to reducing correlation functions of products of operators , to their _ projections _ onto selected states . at the critical point ,",
    "such projections do not have the expected convergence properties .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether one may use other ( weaker ) criteria to determine the critical point . in particular , is it possible to define statistical inference for the operators themselves , rather than special projections ?",
    "the answer is affirmative , and such a theory was constructed almost in parallel with the mit and spin glass models described above .",
    "the basic elements in the probability theory for non - commutative operators @xcite are the following : @xmath131 , a non - commutative ( operator ) algebra over @xmath691 , @xmath1208 ; a functional @xmath1209 , called expectation functional .",
    "quantum mechanics offers specific examples :    * example 1 : @xmath1210 bounded operators over hilbert space of states @xmath1211 , @xmath1212 , the ground state , and @xmath1213 * example 2 : @xmath1210 von neumann algebra over @xmath1211 , and functional @xmath1214 tr .    in order to develop inference methods within this theory , it is necessary to define the equivalent of independent variables in commutative probability .",
    "such variables are called _ free _ , and satisfy the following property : @xmath1215 are free if @xmath1216 and @xmath1217    using these tools , generalizations of standard results in large sample theory are possible .",
    "we mention a few :    * the  gaussian \" distribution ( limit distribution for central limit theorem ) in free probability theory is given by operators with eigenvalues obeying the semi - circle distribution ( wigner - dyson ) @xmath1218 ; * similarly , the poisson distribution has as free correspondent the operators with eigenvalues distribution according to the marchenko - pastur ( elliptical law ) , @xmath1219 ; * the free cauchy distribution is the cauchy distribution itself .    likewise , there is a notion of free fisher entropy , cramr - rao bound , etc .    as announced earlier",
    ", the relation between this theory , random matrices and operator theory for 2d spectral support is two - fold : on one hand , we have the important result that random matrices , in the large size limit , become free non - commutative random variables .",
    "thus , inference in free non - commutative probability may be approximated using ensembles of random matrices , which explains the success of this concept in the physics of disordered quantum systems .",
    "on the other hand , the limit distributions specified above ( via wigner - dyson , marchenko - pastur laws , and their 2d counterparts ) , are described through spectral data . taking this as a starting point ,",
    "it is relevant to construct sequences of operators which approximate the spectrum , which points directly to the methods of section 5 .    as a last remark , an early attempt to employ non - commutative probability theory in mit",
    "was reported in @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the application of this generalized inference method will help elucidate open questions like the ones discussed in this section .",

    "<S> since it was first applied to the study of nuclear interactions by wigner and dyson , almost 60 years ago , random matrix theory ( rmt ) has developed into a field of its own whithin applied mathematics , and is now essential to many parts of theoretical physics , from condensed matter to high energy . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental results obtained so far rely mostly on the theory of random matrices in one dimension ( the dimensionality of the spectrum , or equilibrium probability density ) . in the last few years </S>",
    "<S> , this theory has been extended to the case where the spectrum is two - dimensional , or even fractal , with dimensions between 1 and 2 . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we review these recent developments and indicate some physical problems where the theory can be applied . </S>"
