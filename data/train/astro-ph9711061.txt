    "the rest - frame uv spectra of qsos and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) typically contain strong and broad emission lines ( bels ) from the resonance doublets  1549 ,  1240 and  1034 in the lithium - like isoelectronic sequence .",
    "@xmath5774 is another resonant doublet in that sequence .",
    "its short wavelength makes 774 difficult to measure , but this line deserves special attention because requires ionization energies ( 207  ev ) nearly twice as large as ( 114  ev ) and more than four times larger than ( 48  ev ) .",
    "broad  @xmath5774 lines can therefore probe the extreme high - ionization gas in the broad emission line regions ( belrs ) and test the possible relationship of this gas to other high - ionization phenomena in qso / agn environments .",
    "for example , the -emitting belr has an ionization consistent with the x - ray `` warm '' absorbers ( halpern 1984 ) observed in some quasars and agns .",
    "warm absorbers can be identified by bound - free edges of and near 0.8  kev ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "photoionization calculations indicate that the regions producing line emission would also produce these edges in soft x - rays if the gas lies along our line - of - sight to the x - ray continuum source ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are now several reports of broad 774 emission from qsos ( @xcite , hamann , zuo & tytler 1995b ) , but the data are often of poor quality and the number of secure detections is small .",
    "hamann ( 1995b ) made the first attempt to study the general strength and character of  774 emission in a sample of qsos .",
    "that sample consists of 5 radio - loud and radio - quiet sources measured in the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) absorption line snapshot survey ( absnap ) .",
    "they found that 3 of the 5 sources , and possibly all 5 , have a bel at @xmath0774   .",
    "they argued that the measured wavelengths and fluxes ( compared to photoionization models ) both point to  774 as the most likely identification .",
    "more recently , zheng ( 1997 ) measured the @xmath0774    emission line in a composite spectrum derived from a larger number of qsos .    here",
    "we supplement that work with new photoionization calculations and new _ hst _ and ground - based spectroscopy of four qsos .",
    "we also extract an unbiased sample of 11 qsos from the _ hst _ archives and combine them with our previous absnap sample to construct mean spectra for a total of 16 sources .",
    "the new individual spectra provide the highest signal - to - noise measurements of the feature , while the means allow us to study the  774 emission properties in representative samples .",
    "section 2 below describes the observations and measurements of the emission lines .",
    "section 3 reexamines the  774 identification and provides an analysis of the kinematics and physical conditions based on photoionization simulations and fits to the line profiles .",
    "section 4 discusses the implications of the  774 emission and , in particular , the possible relationship to warm absorbers .",
    "section 5 provides a summary .",
    "we obtained uv spectra of four bright qsos with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on board _",
    "we observed pks  0355@xmath6483 and q  1435@xmath6015 because they were strong candidates for broad  774 emission in our previous study of the _ hst_-absnap sample ( @xcite ) .",
    "we chose pg  1148 + 549 as another candidate for strong emission based on earlier observations with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "we observed the qso pg  1522 + 101 as part of an unrelated absorption - line study and include it here because the _ hst _ spectra contain a strong emission line near 774    rest ( @xcite ) .",
    "the _ hst _ spectra encompass  774 and other prominent lines in the rest frame uv but , for the two highest - redshift sources , q  1435@xmath6015 and pg  1522 + 101 , they do not include the important  1549 line .",
    "we therefore obtained ground - based optical spectra of these qsos with the shane 3.0 m telescope at lick observatory .",
    "table 1 provides a log of the observations , including the dates , the telescopes used ( tel . ) , the spectrographs and their setups / gratings ( instr./setup ) , the wavelengths covered ( @xmath7 ) , the approximate full - width - at - half - maximum resolutions @xmath8 , and the total exposure times ( exp . ) .",
    "the emission - line redshifts listed with the qso names are from hewitt & burbidge ( 1993 ) , except for pg  1148 + 549 , which is from schmidt & green ( 1983 ) .",
    "hst_-fos spectra were obtained through the 1  science aperture and calibrated at the _ space telescope science institute _ using their standard `` pipeline '' procedures .",
    "we recalibrated the absolute wavelengths in the g130h and g270h spectra by requiring that galactic absorption lines appear at their laboratory wavelengths .",
    "we then shifted the g190h or g160l spectra by matching features in spectral regions that overlap with g130h or g270h .",
    "we expect that the final @xmath9 wavelength uncertainties are less than 0.5 diodes , that is @xmath104    with the g160l grating and @xmath100.51    with the higher resolution gratings .",
    "the lick observations employed a 2  slit and a @xmath11 reticon ccd .",
    "we reduced those data in the usual way using vista software ( modified slightly by dr .",
    "t. a. barlow ) .",
    "the wavelength uncertainties in the lick spectra should be less than @xmath00.2   .",
    "we flux - calibrated those spectra by observing both the qsos and standard stars through a wide slit on the same night .",
    "none of the data are corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "we simply note that for a typical high - latitude galactic column density of @xmath12   ( murphy 1995 and references therein ) , a conversion factor of @xmath13  ) ( @xcite ) and a typical extinction curve with @xmath14 ( cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) , the extinction peak at the @xmath02175     silicate feature is roughly 0.5@xmath15 .",
    "this peak coincides with the  1034 emission line for @xmath16 .",
    "figures 14 plot the new and old spectra together .",
    "the new _ hst _ observations of pks  0355@xmath6483 and q  1435@xmath6015 ( figures 1 and 3 ) have higher signal - to - noise ratios and slightly higher resolutions than the absnap data because of the longer exposure times and improved line spread function of the post - costar fos . figure 2 includes two versions of the _ iue _ spectrum of pg  1148 + 549 for comparison to the _ hst _ data . the bottom spectrum in that figure , labeled `` old _ iue _ '' , is the original data as shown in hamann ( 1995a ) . the middle spectrum , labeled `` new _ iue _ '' , is a new reduction of the same data .",
    "the old _ iue _ spectrum was reduced using an optimal extraction technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "the new _ iue _ spectrum derives from the improved image processing system ( newsips ) used for the _ iue _ final archives ( @xcite ) and is the average from three separate images that have been cleaned of cosmic rays .",
    "the new _ iue _ reduction of pg  1148 + 549 has a slightly higher signal - to - noise ratio , but there is a camera artifact at @xmath01663    ( crenshaw 1990 ) that is enhanced by newsips .",
    "the emission line discussed by hamann ( 1995a ) is weaker in both the newsips reduction and the _ hst _ spectrum ( upper curve in figure 3 ) .",
    "figure 4 plots the low ( g160l ) and high ( g190h+g270h ) resolution _ hst _ spectra of pg  1522 + 101 , with the longer wavelength lick observatory data appended to the latter . both _",
    "_ observations of this source show strong @xmath0774    emission , but the higher resolution spectrum shows more clearly the `` forest '' of  absorption lines shortward of the qso s  emission .",
    "these absorption features can significantly distort the continuum and bels in low resolution data .",
    "there is also weak lyman limit absorption in this spectrum at @xmath01980    ( observed ) , which is confirmed by detection of the corresponding lyman series lines .",
    "we constructed mean spectra of two samples of qsos measured with _ hst_-fos and the low - resolution grating ( g160l ) .",
    "the first sample consists of the 5 qsos selected by hamann ( 1995b ) from the _ hst_-absnap database ( @xcite ) .",
    "that sample includes qsos with ( 1 ) emission redshifts ( @xmath17 to 1.4 ) that allow wavelength coverage across both  774 and  1034 with the g160l grating , ( 2 ) no lyman - limit absorption across @xmath0774    in the qso rest frame , and ( 3 ) subjectively `` measurable '' emission .",
    "the last criterion serves as a signal - to - noise discriminator and insures that we can establish an emission redshift for coadding the spectra .",
    "this selection based on could introduce a bias toward sources with more high - ionization gas and thus stronger and emission lines ( see  2.4 below ) .",
    "however , the qsos were _ not _ chosen for their characteristics .",
    "the second sample consists of 11 qsos from the first _",
    "absorption line key project database ( @xcite ) selected by criteria ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above6    at 3@xmath18 ) and a poorly defined redshift ( see @xcite ) . ] .",
    "seven of these qsos have measurable emission and 4 do not",
    ". we will refer to the subset of 7 key project spectra with significant as kp - sub , and the full sample of 11 key project spectra as kp - full .",
    "note that none of the spectra that lack emission , including pg  1407 + 265 ( footnote 2 ) , have a detectable line .",
    "figure 5 plots the mean spectra derived from the various sub - samples and the total sample of 16 sources .",
    "we calculated the means using the new _",
    "hst_-fos spectra of the two absnap sources pks  0355@xmath6483 and q  1435@xmath6015 (  2.1 ) .",
    "the other absnap spectra are from hamann ( 1995b ) .",
    "the key project spectra are from the _ hst _ archives with reductions by schneider ( 1993 ) .",
    "pg  1148 + 549 and pg  1522 + 101 (  2.1 ) are not in the absnap or key project samples and so are not included in the means .",
    "for the 12 sources with well - defined lines ( in the absnap and kp - sub samples ) we shifted the individual spectra to the rest frame by forcing the centroid of the upper @xmath050% of the profile to be at 1033.8   .",
    "for the 4 sources without , we shifted the spectra using published redshifts in hewitt & burbidge ( 1993 ) . applying the published redshifts , which derive from low - ionization lines such as ]  1909 or  2799 ,",
    "leads to larger uncertainties ( by at least several  ) in the rest wavelengths of and because ( 1 ) these redshifts do not compensate for the calibration uncertainties in the _",
    "hst_-fos wavelengths and ( 2 ) there are known intrinsic redshift differences between high- and low - ionization lines ( @xcite ) . in all cases , we normalized the continua to unity by fitting with low - order polynomials and then averaged the spectra with equal weights .",
    "wavelength regions at the ends of individual spectra were excluded from the means if they contain obvious lyman - limit absorption , severe noise spikes , or geocoronal emission lines such as   in first or second order .",
    "the histogram at the bottom of figure 5 indicates the number of spectra contributing to the total mean at each wavelength .",
    "median spectra drawn from these samples are qualitatively the same as the means .",
    "table 2 lists the centroid rest wavelengths ( @xmath19 ) , rest equivalent widths ( rews ) , observed fluxes ( flux ) , and full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) for emission lines detected in the new _ hst _ and lick spectra ( figures 14 ) and in several of the mean spectra ( figure 5 ) .",
    "not all of the lines labeled in figures 15 are present in the data ; for example ,  615 and ]  895 are not detected in any source with approximate 3@xmath18 upper limits of rew  @xmath20    in all cases .",
    "the measurements for pg  1522 + 101 are from the higher resolution data after interpolating across the strongest of the overlying  forest lines .",
    "we made no attempt to correct for absorption lines in the other sources .",
    "the fluxes given for the mean spectra are relative to  1034 , while those given for the individual sources are as observed with units 10@xmath21 ergs s@xmath22 @xmath4 . recall that the data are not corrected for galactic extinction (  2.1 ) .",
    "the equivalent widths are immune to extinction effects , but the fluxes are not . in a worst - case scenario , with the @xmath02175    extinction peak overlying the line (  2.1 ) ,",
    "the differential extinction between and for a typical galactic column density would be @xmath00.1@xmath15 and would lead us to overestimate the true / flux ratio by 10% .",
    "the emission lines were measured by integrating the flux above the fits to the continua ( dotted curves in figures 15 ) between the wavelengths indicated by @xmath23 in table 2 .",
    "we did not attempt to separate severely blended lines or line components .",
    "in particular , the feature we attribute to  1034 could have a contribution from  1026 .",
    "laor ( 1995 ) and wills ( 1995 ) estimate that the mean   contributions to this blend are @xmath023% and @xmath1010% , respectively , in samples of low - redshift qsos measured with _",
    "we will ignore this small contribution in our discussions below .",
    "we will also ignore the weak  1527 line that can add to the measured  1549 flux .",
    "the feature we identify as  774 is clearly present in the mean spectra , and it is stronger than the means ( both in rew and relative to other lines ) in the individual qsos pks  0355@xmath6483 ( radio - loud ) and pg  1522 + 101 ( radio - quiet ) .",
    "the observations of q  1435@xmath6015 are less conclusive , but the new data are consistent with the previous report of strong @xmath0774    emission from this source ( @xcite ) .",
    "hst_-fos spectrum of pg  1148 + 549 does not exhibit the strong @xmath0774    line noted in the original _ iue _ data ( @xcite ) .",
    "hst _ spectrum of this source resembles the reprocessed ( `` new '' ) _ iue _ spectrum ( fig .",
    "3 ) , indicating that the line is weaker than our previous claim .    there is evidence in the means and in some of the individual spectra for emission from the excited - state line @xmath24  1176 and from a broad unidentified feature at @xmath01070   .",
    "the unidentified feature was noted previously by laor ( 1994 and 1995 ) in their sample of low - redshift qsos . the @xmath24 line could prove to be a valuable diagnostic of belr physical conditions because it involves a transition between unusually high energy states ,",
    "17.1 to 6.5 ev . the lower state is metastable and gives rise to the well - known ]  1909 emission line ( see @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "unbiased measurements of the average @xmath0774    line strength require spectra of many qsos selected by only their redshifts and their lack of overlying lyman - limit absorption ( criteria 1 and 2 in  2.2 ) . among the data we collected , the kp - full sample of 11 spectra comes closest to this ideal",
    ". the average @xmath0774     line in that sample has rew  @xmath0  5.9    and a flux of @xmath042% of  1034 ( table 2 ) .",
    "these results can be compared to rew  @xmath0  3.2    and a flux ratio of 774/1034  @xmath0  21% reported by zheng ( 1997 ) from their composite _ hst _ spectrum .",
    "the zheng composite includes @xmath020 spectra across @xmath0774    and 8090 across the line .",
    "our kp - full sample is undoubtedly a subset of the spectra they used .",
    "the different line strengths in these two samples could be caused by random fluctuations in the small numbers of spectra involved and/or by the large measurement uncertainties , which are dominated by the subjective continuum placement .",
    "however , the reported differences might also be caused by selection effects .",
    "in particular , there is an inherent `` baldwin effect '' in the zheng composite .",
    "several studies have shown that this effect is pervasive in qso samples ; more luminous qsos have typically lower emission - line rews ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra in the _ hst _ database are primarily of the brightest qsos at each redshift .",
    "our kp - full sample includes a relatively narrow redshift range so that @xmath0774    through @xmath01034    are measured in the same data , but the zheng composite has many more low redshift and low luminousity qsos contributing at long wavelengths ( e.g. across ) than at short wavelengths ( at ) .",
    "therefore their composite should have a larger rew in 1034 , a smaller rew in 774 and a lower 774/1034 strength ratio compared to our kp - full sample , which agrees with the measured results .",
    "therefore , our kp - full sample , although still limited by the small number of spectra and significant measurement uncertainties , should provide the most representative measure of the 774 line strength and the 774/1034 flux ratio in ( bright ) qsos at redshift @xmath01 .",
    "the absnap and kp - sub samples both have stronger 774 lines than kp - full , probably because of a selection bias introduced by the requirement for `` measurable '' emission (  2.2 ) .",
    "note , however , that while 774 is stronger in the absnap sample , 1034 and the  blend are not ; therefore , the nature and extent of the selection bias is ambiguous .",
    "the total mean mixes the absnap and kp - full samples and therefore has slightly stronger @xmath0774    line emission than kp - full alone .",
    "theoretical models of the belr are needed to understand the conditions under which  774 forms and the likelihood that other lines near this wavelength might contribute to the measured emission .",
    "some recent photoionization calculations have made specific predictions for the line strength ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we update the calculations in hamann ( 1995a ) using a newer version of cloudy ( 90.02 ; @xcite ) to examine other strong lines at wavelengths @xmath251000    and test whether recent improvements in the atomic data affect the results ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the most likely contributors to broad line emission near 774     are  774 ,  765 ,  789 ,  786 and  763 ( verner , verner & ferland 1996 ) .",
    "the calculations by hamann ( 1995a ) indicate that the alternatives to should be relatively weak , and therefore is the most likely identification for the measured line .",
    "figure 6 shows the line equivalent widths predicted by cloudy for different values of the ionization parameter @xmath26 ( defined as the dimensionless ratio of hydrogen - ionizing photon to hydrogen particle densities at the illuminated face of the clouds ) .",
    "this plot is analogous to figure 2 in hamann ( 1995a ) .",
    "the model clouds have a space density of @xmath27  , a column density of @xmath28  and solar element abundances .",
    "they are illuminated on one side by a standard qso spectrum that is believed to be typical of low - redshift qsos and seyfert 1 nuclei ( @xcite ) .",
    "we modified this spectrum to have a sharp decline at wavelengths longer than 2  @xmath29 m to avoid significant free - free heating ( @xcite ) .",
    "the internal cloud velocities are assumed to be thermal .",
    "the equivalent widths in figure 6 apply for emitting regions that completely cover the central qso ( over 4@xmath30 ster ) but are transparent to the radiation from other clouds ( e.g.  and photons emitted on the far side of the qso are not absorbed or reflected by clouds on the near side ) .",
    "the effects of different space densities and spectral shapes on some of the line strengths are shown by korista ( 1997 ) and netzer ( 1996 ) .",
    "in general , the relative strengths of the permitted lines in figure 6 are only weakly dependent on the space density for a given @xmath26 .",
    "the intercombination lines ] and ] are strongly suppressed above their common critical density of @xmath0@xmath31  .",
    "smaller column densities would significantly reduce the emission from low- to intermediate - ionization lines ( e.g. , and ) at the right in figure 6 , because these lines form strictly at large depths in the high-@xmath26 clouds ( see fig . 3 in hamann 1995a ) .",
    "examination of the heating and cooling processes indicates that , for the continuum shape used here , clouds with @xmath32 are thermally unstable ( @xcite ) .",
    "the only important difference between figure 6 here and figure 2 in hamann ( 1995a ) is that the line is now several times stronger , particularly at low and intermediate @xmath26 ; but the main results are the same .",
    "786 and  763 are too weak under any circumstances to produce the measured @xmath0774    line .",
    "( the predicted  763 line , not shown in fig .",
    "6 , is at least 5 times weaker than  786 . )",
    "the  765 and  789 lines are the strongest alternatives to  774 .",
    "they form in roughly the same gas as  1549 , so their strengths relative to are not sensitive to the uncertain geometry or physical conditions . scaling the predicted / and / ratios in figure 6 by the measurements in table 2",
    "shows that the observed 774    lines in pks  0355@xmath6483 and pg  1522 + 101 are much too strong to have significant contributions from or .",
    "in particular , for @xmath33 ( see  4 ) , + should have rew  @xmath10  0.6    in pks  0355@xmath6483 and rew  @xmath10  1.9     in pg  1522 + 101 , compared to the measured value of rew  @xmath0  13.5     in both qsos .",
    "the ratio of the fluxes predicted in + to that measured in @xmath0774    is therefore @xmath100.07 in pks  0355@xmath6483 and @xmath100.3 in pg  1522 + 101 .",
    "the mean spectra ( fig .",
    "5 ) do not include  1549 for comparison , but in large ground - based samples has rew  @xmath0  20 to 32   , or about @xmath050% of  ( see the compilation by @xcite ) .",
    "if we adopt a conservatively large value of rew(1549 )  =  40   , then figure 6 implies that the average + emission should have rew  @xmath34    for @xmath35 or rew  @xmath36    for @xmath33 .",
    "these estimates are no more than about half the measured mean of rew  @xmath0  5.9    in the @xmath0774    line (  2.4 ) .",
    "since values of @xmath35 are generally favored for the emitting region (  4 ) , the average contributions of and to the @xmath0774    feature should be @xmath1017% .",
    "these results indicate that  774 dominates the average @xmath0774    emission and is the only significant contributor whenever this line is strong compared to .",
    "experiments with cloudy show that this conclusion holds even if the metallicities are above solar and nitrogen is several times overabundant relative to the other metals ( @xcite and 1993 ) .",
    "figure 6 also supports the conclusions in hamann ( 1995a ) regarding the ionization , column densities and covering factors of the emitting regions .",
    "significant emission in  774 , relative to both the continuum and other lines , requires ionization parameters @xmath37 .",
    "thermal stability in the clouds independently requires @xmath38 , for an overall range of @xmath39 in the line - forming gas .",
    "the ratio of the observed mean ( 5.9   ;  2.4 ) to largest - predicted ( @xmath020   ; fig .",
    "6 ) 774 equivalent widths implies an average minimum covering factor of @xmath030% .",
    "the emitting regions must subtend at least this fraction of the sky as seen from the central qso to produce the average equivalent width .",
    "( the same analysis shows that the strongest emitters , pks  0355@xmath6483 and pg  1522 + 101 , require covering factors @xmath165% . )",
    "the observed mean 774 equivalent width also requires a minimum hydrogen column density of @xmath40  for solar abundances , even if the emitting region completely covers the central qso ( see figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "( the strongest emitters require column densities at least twice as high . ) for the range in @xmath26 values given above , column densities beyond @xmath41  do not add to the flux , so we have an effective upper limit of @xmath42  for emission .",
    "these results are uncertain by factors of a few because they depend on the poorly known shape of the ionizing spectrum .",
    "the ionization parameter reflects the integrated continuum flux at energies @xmath113.6  ev , but the ionization depends only on the flux above 207  ev .",
    "therefore , different continuum shapes will yield different estimates of the minimum @xmath26 value .",
    "netzer ( 1996 ) argued that highly ionized species like are best described by an x - ray ionization parameter , @xmath43 , that includes energies between only 0.1 and 10 kev .",
    "a similar problem is that the equivalent widths measure the line strengths relative to the _ local _ continuum ( e.g. at 774   ) , even though that continuum has little to do with the production of  774 .",
    "recent calculations by netzer ( 1996 ) predict @xmath03 times lower equivalent widths for 774 compared to figure 6 because of a softer assumed continuum ; the flux ratio @xmath44 is @xmath03 times smaller in netzer s ( 1996 ) continuum than in the mathews & ferland ( 1987 ) continuum used in figure 6 .",
    "conversely , experiments with cloudy show that harder ( flatter ) continua , such as the single power law @xmath45 or the `` baseline '' continuum used by korista ( 1997 ) , roughly double the peak equivalent width compared to figure 6 and shift the rew curve to more than 5 times lower @xmath26 .",
    "even harder power - law continua , such as @xmath46 , still only double the peak equivalent width .",
    "the ratio of observed ( @xmath05.9   ) to largest - predicted ( @xmath040   ) equivalent widths in these extreme cases therefore implies a lower limit on the average covering factor of @xmath015% .",
    "another uncertainty is the importance of continuum pumping to the line emission . if there are large velocity dispersions along radial lines of sight through the belr , the resonant absorption of continuum photons can `` pump '' electrons into upper energy states and significantly enhance the emission line fluxes .",
    "this pumping can take two forms , ( 1 ) resonant line scattering ( absorption and re - emission in the same transition ) , and ( 2 ) continuum fluorescence ( absorption into high energy states followed by cascades through intermediate energy levels ) .",
    "these processes are negligible for metallic lines in `` standard '' belr models ( e.g. fig .",
    "6 above ) because the continuum photons encounter only thermal line widths in the belr . however , if there is substantial turbulence or a large range of radial velocities ( e.g. in an outflow ) , the absorption of continuum photons can compete with other excitation mechanisms  particularly in weak resonance lines .",
    "since the velocity field in the belr is essentially unknown , we consider the possible effects of line scattering and continuum fluorescence here .",
    "the amount of scattering in a given line depends on its velocity width and optical depth as encountered by the continuum radiation . for unblended resonance lines that ( 1 ) have no alternate decay routes , ( 2 )",
    "are not collisionally deexcited ( e.g. at high densities ) , and ( 3 ) are on the flat part of the curve - of - growth ( optically thick but no damping wings ) , the scattering equivalent width resulting from thermal or micro - turbulent gas velocities can be derived by integrating over the saturated absorption line profile .",
    "this integration yields @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the covering factor of the emission region ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 is the line wavelength , @xmath51 is the line - center optical depth , and @xmath52 is the doppler velocity ( thermal or turbulent ) .",
    "similarly , radial outflows spanning a velocity range @xmath53 in optically thick lines will produce scattering equivalent widths of @xmath54 keeping in mind that @xmath55 in eqn . 1 and that well - separated doublets like  770,780 scatter twice as much flux as single or blended lines , one can use the values of @xmath51 plotted by hamann ( 1995a ) for strictly thermal velocities to estimate @xmath56 for different values of @xmath52 . here",
    "we use cloudy to derive the @xmath51 directly for models identical to figure 6 but with larger @xmath52 .",
    "we find that for clouds with @xmath57 and @xmath58  , the doublet has @xmath59   .",
    "similarly , for @xmath60 and @xmath58  ,  1549 has @xmath61    and the  765 and  789 lines both have @xmath62   .",
    "continuum fluorescence will enhance the line emission further via cascades from upper energy states .",
    "the importance of fluorescence versus scattering emission for a given line depends on the number of pumping transitions available to higher states , the optical depths in those transitions , the shape of the incident continuum , and the branching ratios ( including escape probabilities ) out of the upper states ( see also ferguson , ferland & pradhan 1995 ) . experiments with multi - level atoms in cloudy indicate that the equivalent widths due to scattering _ and _ fluorescence are factors of @xmath01.5 to @xmath02 larger than the estimates above for scattering alone .",
    "if we add these illustrative scattering+fluorescence equivalent widths to the rews in figure 6 , we would derive lower minimum covering factors and minimum column densities for the  774 emitting region by factors of a few compared to  3.1.2 .",
    "more importantly , the predicted contributions of  765 and  789 to the measured @xmath0774    lines would be several times larger than our estimates in  3.1.1 , because the theoretical ratio of + to emission becomes larger .",
    "therefore ,  774 might not dominate the average @xmath0774    emission if there are large radial velocity dispersions that induce substantial continuum pumping .",
    "a thorough analysis of this possibility is beyond the scope of the present paper ; we note simply that continuum pumping should also enhance the emission in other weak lines .",
    "future studies might test the continuum pumping hypothesis by examining these weak lines and looking for correlations with the measured @xmath0774    feature .",
    "for example , strong continuum pumping in  765 and  789 at @xmath63 should be accompanied by strong pumped emission from  977 ,  991 and  834 .",
    "similarly , strong pumping contributions to  774 at @xmath64 should come with highly pumped  615 emission and an / flux ratio that is closer to unity than in figure 6 .",
    "our limited cloudy experiments with @xmath58  did not reveal any significant discrepancies with the data that would immediately rule out or require large pumping contributions .",
    "the _ hst _ spectra of pks  0355@xmath6483 and pg  1522 + 101 ( figs .",
    "1 and 4 ) have the strongest and most reliably measured emission lines near 774   .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show that their , , and emission lines all have similar profiles .",
    "the only significant difference is that and are broader than in pks  0355@xmath6483 .",
    "this small difference might be due to either the larger doublet separations in and ( see fig .",
    "7 ) or small differences in the velocities in their emitting regions . in contrast , the @xmath0774    features in both qsos are dramatically broader than the other bels ( see also table 2 ) .",
    "figure 9 shows similar results for q  1435@xmath6015 , although in this case comparisons with the @xmath0774    line are more uncertain .",
    "overall , we measure fwhms in the @xmath0774    feature that are roughly 2 to 5 times larger than and the other bels in the same spectra ( table 2 ) .    figures 10 and 11 show our attempts at fitting the @xmath0774     features in pks  0355@xmath6483 and pg  1522 + 101 using the measured profiles as templates .",
    "we constructed the templates by smoothing the profiles without correcting for the doublet separation ( because it is relatively small , @xmath0500  ) .",
    "the top panels in figures 10 and 11 show the best fits assuming that is the only contributor to the measured feature and both of the doublet members ( 770 and 780   ) have the same redshift and profile as .",
    "the only freely varied parameters were the line strengths .",
    "the best fits were determined by @xmath65 minimization ( with the narrow  forest lines excluded from the minimization in pg  1522 + 101 ) .",
    "the -only fits show that the @xmath0774    features are consistent with emission at the redshifts ( see also table 2 and figs .",
    "79 above ) . in pks  0355@xmath6483 the redshifts of these lines are indistinguishable . in pg  1522 + 101",
    "the purported line is redshifted by up to @xmath02000  with respect to the peak , but this shift might not be significant given the profile and centroid uncertainties in the broad @xmath0774    feature .",
    "the much more significant result is that the profiles are far too narrow to explain the @xmath0774    features in terms of .",
    "the lower two panels in figures 10 and 11 plot the best fits with large contributions from  765 and  789 .",
    "these fits assume that and also have the same redshift and profile as , with the fluxes freely varied .",
    "the results using  765 and  789 alone ( middle panels ) account better for the overall width of the @xmath0774    features but they do not match the profile shapes . fits using and together with the two doublet members ( bottom panels ) are much better , but we reiterate the conclusion from  3.1 ;  765 and  789 should be much weaker than they are portrayed in figures 10 and 11 , unless continuum pumping controls the line excitation .",
    "if the observed @xmath0774    features are dominated by , the velocity profiles must be substantially broader than and other bels in the same spectra .",
    "we can estimate the widths of the individual doublet components by fitting the @xmath0774    emisison in pks  0355@xmath6483 and pg  1522 + 101 with one gaussian for each doublet member .",
    "for these fits we require that the two gaussian components have the same redshift and velocity width , but the values of those parameters and the strengths of the lines are all freely varied . the results ( shown in figure 12 ) match the data reasonably well ; the fit profiles are only slightly more centrally peaked than the observed lines . in both qsos , the observed lines are fit slightly better by a 1:1 doublet ratio , but 2:1 ratios are not ruled out .",
    "the centroids of the fits are within 0.3    of the values listed in table 2 and the individual components have fwhm  @xmath0  14,000  in both qsos .",
    "this velocity width is similar to the fwhms measured directly from the profiles ( table 2 ) .",
    "these results imply that the velocities in the region are 25 times larger than in the -emitting gas . to understand how much of the flux might come from the lower - velocity gas",
    ", we performed additional fits to the pks  0355@xmath6483 and pg  1522 + 101 profiles using ( 1 ) the template at the redshift ( as in the top panels of figs .",
    "10 and 11 ) plus ( 2 ) a gaussian doublet with freely - varied width and redshift ( as in fig .",
    "12 ) . for both qsos",
    "the @xmath65 minimization forced the template contributions to zero , yielding fits identical to fig .",
    "12 . therefore , to first order , the measured profiles suggest emission from a high - velocity region with little or no contribution from the -emitting gas .",
    "we did not fit the  774 profiles in the mean spectra because they might be broadened by uncertainties in the measured redshifts and by real redshift differences between and the other lines .",
    "also , our selection requirement for measurable emission might bias the absnap and kp - sub samples toward more `` peaky '' line profiles .",
    "nonetheless , we note that the mean profiles are comparable to those in pks  0355@xmath6483 and pg  1522 + 101 and more than twice as broad as both and  ( table 2 ) . although possibly spurious , this result is consistent with the individual qsos discussed above .",
    "we also note that the @xmath0774    centroid is slightly redshifted in the mean spectra ( by @xmath01000  ) with respect to the peak ( table 2 ) ; however , this velocity shift is probably smaller than the uncertainties .",
    "the ionization parameters ( @xmath39 ) and covering factors ( @xmath130% ) derived for the emitting region (  3.1.2 ) are both considerably larger than estimates based on low- to intermediate - ionization lines such as ,  2799 , and  1549 .",
    "in particular , the latter lines indicate @xmath66 ( @xcite ) , while values as high as @xmath67 have been inferred when  1034 is also considered ( @xcite ) .",
    "the covering factor of the low - ionization region is expected to be @xmath1010% based on both the ratio of observed to predicted  equivalent widths and the infrequency of lyman limit absorption edges at the emission redshift ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the much larger covering factor of the region implies that the high - ionization gas is optically thin in the lyman continuum ( otherwise it would overproduce the   emission ) .",
    "optically thin , high - ionization clouds have been proposed before to explain the strength of the and lines ( @xcite ) , and there is evidence from agn variability studies that part of the  1549 emission comes from optically thin gas ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our results suggest that the highest ionization lines have the largest contributions from optically thin gas .",
    "george , turner & netzer ( 1995 ) reached a similar conclusion based on the tentative detection of a large line equivalent width in x - ray spectra of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  3783 .    in spite of the low optical depths near the lyman limit",
    ", the -emitting gas has a substantial opacity to soft x - rays .",
    "our calculations show that and are the dominant species of oxygen in the -emitting region ( see , for example , fig . 3 in hamann 1995c ) .",
    "the minimum column density of @xmath68   (  3.1.2 ) implies a minimum column in + of @xmath69  .",
    "the resulting optical depth through the gas is @xmath70 at the or edges ( based on photoionization cross - sections in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the component of the belr would be a strong warm absorber , characterized by + edges at @xmath00.8 kev , if it lies along our line of sight to the x - ray continuum source ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the range of physical conditions needed for strong emission , @xmath39 and @xmath71   (  3.1.2 ) , encompasses the specific conditions estimated for several strong warm absorbers ( e.g. mathur , wilkes & aldcroft 1997 , @xcite ) .",
    "the broad  774 lines reported here clearly identify a belr component with warm absorber properties .    these results support models in which the warm absorbers are part of , or closely related to , the belr ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "other studies suggest that warm absorbers are also closely related to the blueshifted absorption lines observed in some qsos and seyfert galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "these absorption lines form in outflows with line - of - sight velocities ranging from near zero to @xmath120,000  ( e.g. in the broad absorption line [ bal ] systems ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is no direct evidence for outflow in the  774 emission - line data , but the ultra - broad line widths reported here , with fwhm  @xmath0  14,500  in two well - measured cases , are consistent with high velocities in the warm absorber gas .",
    "the large fwhms are also consistent with emission from the `` very broad line region '' ( vblr ) , which was identified by ferland , korista & peterson ( 1990 ) from the non - varying  line wings in a seyfert 1 galaxy .",
    "ferland ( 1990 ) present independent arguments that the vblr is highly ionized , optically thin at the lyman limit and the likely source of x - ray warm absorption ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the large covering factors and warm absorber - like properties of the emitting regions suggest that warm absorbers should be common in qsos .",
    "the most recent x - ray surveys indicate that warm absorbers are common in seyfert 1 nuclei ( with a @xmath150% detection rate ; @xcite ) but _ rare _ in qsos ( @xmath05% detection rate ; @xcite ) .",
    "the rarity of warm absorbers in qsos might be reconciled with the emission - line data if ( 1 ) qso ionizing spectra are harder than the mathews & ferland ( 1987 ) continuum , requiring smaller covering factors (  3.1.2 ) , ( 2 ) large radial velocity dispersions ( @xmath11000  ) in the belr enhance the emission in  774 and other weak lines via continuum pumping (  3.1.3 ) , or ( 3 ) qsos are observed over limited viewing angles that usually avoid gas along our line - of - sight to the x - ray continuum source .",
    "viewing angles that avoid the belr might occur naturally in the recent disk - wind models ( @xcite ) . in these models ,",
    "all of the bels form close to the accretion disk and the highest ionization lines form at the smallest disk radii .",
    "murray ( 1996 ) pointed out that the exceptionally broad  774 profiles might be due to enhanced rotational broadening associated with the inner disk .",
    "however , that interpretation might conflict with our estimates of large covering factors , which require substantial emission from regions away from the disk plane .",
    "better data and more specific comparisons with the models are needed before drawing firm conclusions .",
    "the large  774 line widths compared to  1549 and especially  1034 might provide strong constraints on models of the emitting regions in general .",
    "the calculations in figure 6 indicate that the gas producing the ultra - broad line should also produce considerable emission .",
    "this ultra - broad component to the lines might be hard to hide in the measured profiles , particularly for sources like pks  0355@xmath6483 where any high - velocity emission must be weak compared to  774 ( figs . 1 and 7 ) .",
    "however , we can lower the predicted / flux ratio by adopting large values of @xmath26 and/or lower @xmath72 compared to that used in figure 6 .",
    "( adding continuum pumping via large turbulent velocities [  3.1.3 ] does not significantly alter the / flux ratio . ) limited experiments with cloudy indicate that  1034 can be @xmath02 or more times weaker than  774 if @xmath73 and @xmath74  .",
    "larger gas densities and/or different ionizing continuum shapes can further reduce the theoretical / flux ratio ( see also @xcite ) . alternatively , or perhaps in addition , the measured @xmath0774    lines might be broadened by blending with  765 and  789 if their emission is enhanced by continuum pumping (   3.1.3 and 3.2.1 ) . in that case , the true line widths could be comparable to the other bels and there would be no need for an ultra - high velocity emitting region .",
    "the mean spectrum of an unbiased sample ( kp - full ) of 11 radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos clearly shows broad - line emission at @xmath0774     with an average rew of @xmath05.9    and an average flux equal to @xmath042% of  1034 .",
    "this result supports our previous conclusion ( based on a smaller sample ) that @xmath0774    emission is common in qsos .",
    "hst_-fos spectra of individual qsos reveal a strong and broad @xmath0774    line in pg  1522 + 101 ( also @xcite ) , and they support the prior claims of strong @xmath0774     lines in pks  0355@xmath6483 and q  1435@xmath6015 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the new spectra contradict the report ( based on old _ iue _ data ) that the @xmath0774    line is strong in pg  1148 + 549 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the centroids of the observed @xmath0774    features support as the single most likely identification , but the velocity widths are significantly larger than  1034 and all other bels in two well - measured qsos ( pks  0355@xmath6483 and pg  1522 + 101 ) and probably in the mean spectra .",
    "the @xmath0774    line widths , ranging from fwhm  @xmath75  11,000 to 15,000  , are @xmath02 to 5 times larger than the lower - ionization bels .",
    "these ultra - broad profiles are consistent with significant contributions from  765 and  789 emission . however , photoionization calculations coupled with measurements of  1549 constrain the and line strengths to be at least several times weaker than the average @xmath0774    emission (  3.1.1 ) .",
    "we conclude that exceptionally broad  774 dominates the average feature and is the only significant contributor when this line is strong compared to  1549 . the only way to avoid this conclusion is to invoke large line - of - sight velocity dispersions ( @xmath11000  ) in the belr , so that the resonant absorption of continuum photons greatly enhances the and line strengths relative to both the continuum and  1549 (  3.1.3 ) .",
    "if dominates the @xmath0774    emission , fits to the line profiles indicate that most of the flux comes from a distinct high - velocity region , with little or no contribution from the low - velocity gas responsible for and the other lower - ionization lines (  3.2.1 ) .",
    "the photoionization calculations also indicate that the emitting regions have ionization parameters @xmath39 , total column densities @xmath71  , and covering factors @xmath130% of 4@xmath30  steradians ( for solar abundances and a standard ionizing spectrum ;  3.1.2 ) .",
    "these results are uncertain by factors of a few because of the poorly known shape of the far - uv spectrum and the possible large contributions to the line fluxes from continuum pumping .",
    "nonetheless , the component of the belr must be considerably more ionized and probably more extensive than the regions producing lines like ,  2799 , and  1549 .",
    "the physical conditions in the emitting clouds are characteristic of the highly - ionized `` warm '' absorbers observed in soft x - rays , suggesting a close relationship between the belr and the warm absorber gas .",
    "the emitting regions would themselves produce warm absorption ( e.g. bound - free edges of + at @xmath00.8 kev ) if they lie along our line of sight to the x - ray continuum source .",

    "<S> the results support our previous claim that broad lines are common in qsos , with an average flux of @xmath042% of  1034 and velocity widths that are @xmath02 to 5 times larger than ,  1549 and other broad lines in the same spectra . the strongest and most reliably measured  774 lines ( in two sources ) have fwhm  @xmath0  14,500  . </S>",
    "<S> line profile fits in these cases show that the unusually large widths might be caused by blending with emission from  765 and  789 . </S>",
    "<S> however , standard photoionization calculations indicate that , and all other lines near this wavelength should be too weak , leaving ( very broad ) as the only viable identification for the @xmath0774    feature . </S>",
    "<S> ( this conclusion might be avoided if there are large radial velocity dispersions [ @xmath11000  ] in the emitting region and the resonant absorption of continuum photons enhances the flux in weaker lines . ) </S>",
    "<S> the calculations also indicate that the emitting regions have ionization parameters in the range @xmath2 , total hydrogen column densities of @xmath3  @xmath4 , and an average covering factor of @xmath130% ( for solar abundances and a nominal qso continuum shape ) . </S>",
    "<S> the emitting region is therefore more extensive , more highly ionized , and has much higher velocities than the rest of the broad emission line region ( belr ) . </S>",
    "<S> this highly - ionized belr component would be a strong x - ray `` warm '' absorber if it lies along our line - of - sight to the x - ray continuum source . </S>"
