    "the structure of an atomic cluster often differs from that of the corresponding bulk material @xcite . in such a cluster ,",
    "the number of surface atoms is comparable to the number of interior atoms , and consequently , the surface energy plays an important role in determining the overall structure .",
    "for example , regular noncrystalline structures with fivefold axes of symmetry , such as icosahedra and decahedra , are known to occur in gold and a variety of other face - centered cubic ( fcc ) metals @xcite .",
    "such structures are comprised of deformed fcc tetrahedral units where adjacent tetrahedral faces meet at a twin plane .",
    "the energy cost of twinning at the inner tetrahedral faces , and the strain energy in the deformed tetrahedra , is overcome by the resulting energetically favorable close - packed outer faces @xcite .",
    "the structure of a cluster , while not only of fundamental interest , is also a key determinant of many of its properties .",
    "however the delicate balance between surface and internal energies often produces a complex dependence of structure upon cluster size @xcite .",
    "eventually , as the size of a cluster increases , the bulk structure must win out , but at sizes below this , clusters can assume a variety of regular non - crystalline structures . for systems that can be adequately described by pair potentials ,",
    "there is a relatively good understanding of how structure depends on the form of the potential @xcite .",
    "however , for many systems of interest , such as metals , the interatomic interactions are more complex .",
    "metals exhibit a strong many - body character to their bonding , and because of this , the competition between fcc , icosahedral and decahedral structures is less well understood .",
    "in addition , many - body effects can potentially lead to the emergence of new structural forms @xcite . in order to study the effect of this bonding on structure , it is often necessary to resort to empirical potentials , as _ ab initio _ electronic structure methods are prohibitively expensive for all but the smallest cluster sizes .",
    "for example , lead clusters have been studied using a many - body glue potential @xcite .",
    "the first comprehensive computational study of lead cluster structure , by lim , ong and ercolessi @xcite , utilized this potential to compare the energetics of closed - shell fcc cuboctahedral and mackay icosahedral structures for cluster sizes from 55 to 3871 atoms . by directly comparing the binding energies at the same numbers of atoms for each structure",
    ", they demonstrated that the fcc cuboctahedra were favored over mackay icosahedra over this size range .",
    "however , electron diffraction of 3 - 7 nm lead clusters has produced diffraction patterns that can not be adequately fitted by fcc structural models @xcite . in addition , recent simulations of the melting and freezing of clusters , using the same glue potential as lim , ong and ercolessi @xcite , have unexpectedly revealed that fcc structures were not the lowest in energy in this size range@xcite . in these simulations ,",
    "clusters were prepared by the quenching of liquid lead droplets .",
    "this procedure was found to produce icosahedra overwhelmingly , and these resolidified icosahedra were found to be energetically favored over fcc structures @xcite .",
    "the resolidified icosahedra resembled anti - mackay icosahedra @xcite which have a mackay icosahedral core but with most of the outer layer in hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) surface sites .",
    "the improved stability of these icosahedra was evidently due to this surface reconstruction .",
    "the purpose of this work is to examine the surface reconstruction of these resolidified icosahedra in more detail . in particular",
    ", we will show that the surface reconstruction is similar , but not identical , to that of the anti - mackay icosahedra .",
    "these surfaces features lead us to identify a new family of icosahedral structures , of which the anti - mackay icosahedron is a member .",
    "we will describe these structures in detail , and show how they can lead to lower energy structures for the lead glue potential .",
    "molecular dynamics was performed using a local version of the classical molecular dynamics code alcmd , originally developed by ames laboratory .",
    "finite temperature simulations were performed in the microcanonical ensemble ( i.e. constant energy ) .",
    "the time step was chosen as @xmath0 throughout .",
    "melting and freezing simulations were carried out using the procedure detailed in hendy and hall@xcite .",
    "the inter - atomic potential used is due to lim , ong and ercolessi @xcite .",
    "this is a many - body glue - type potential , given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a short - range pair potential and @xmath3 is a many - body glue term which reflects the effects of non - local metallic bonding .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 is a `` generalized coordination number '' for atom @xmath5 defined as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is some short - ranged `` atomic density '' function . in practice",
    ", the function @xmath8 has a cut - off @xmath9 , beyond which @xmath10 , and for the potential here , a value of @xmath11 is used .",
    "this cut - off typically lies between the second and third neighbor shells .",
    "the three functions @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath12 have been obtained by fitting to a number of known properties of lead including cohesive energy , surface energy , elastic constants , phonon frequencies , thermal expansion and melting temperature @xcite .",
    "this potential has been used previously to model lead clusters @xcite , temperature - dependent surface reconstructions of low - index lead surfaces @xcite and pre - melting of low - index lead surfaces @xcite .",
    "recently , putative global minimum energy cluster structures were determined for this potential , for cluster sizes of up to 160 atoms @xcite .",
    "common neighbor analysis @xcite ( cna ) has been used here to analyze cluster structures @xcite .",
    "cna is a decomposition of the radial distribution function ( rdf ) according to the local environment of each pair .",
    "we consider that the first peak in the rdf represents  bonded \" neighbors .",
    "as such , if @xmath13 is the first minimum in the rdf , we classify any pair separated by @xmath14 as a bonded pair . with this identification",
    ", any pair contributing to the rdf can be classified by a set of three indices , @xmath15 , which provide information on the local environment of the pair . the first index , @xmath5 , is the number of bonded neighbors common to both atoms . the second index , @xmath16 , is the number of bonds between this set of common neighbors . the third index , @xmath17 , is the number of bonds in the longest continuous chain formed by the @xmath16 bonds between common neighbors .",
    "cna is useful here because it allows one to distinguish between local atomic arrangements , including fcc and icosahedral environments , using the type and number of @xmath15 indices of each atom . for each atom",
    ", we can define @xmath18 to be the number of bonds of this atom with cna indices @xmath15 .",
    "we can then classify the local environment of each atom using these @xmath18 values . in table  [ cna ]",
    "we have listed the classifications of cna signatures used here to label the local environment of an atom ( this classification is similar but not identical to that used by cleveland , luedtke and landman@xcite ) .",
    "we note that these signatures are based only on the cna decomposition of the first peak in the rdf .    [ cols=\"^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ table_surf ] further decomposes the total energy of 2057-atom structures into the glue and pair potential components .",
    "the resolidified icosahedron is able to achieve a considerably lower glue energy than the two conventional structures , which more than compensates for an increase in the pair energy .",
    "we can further decompose the pair energy into two parts @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of nearest neighbors , @xmath21 is the depth of the pair potential and @xmath22 is the energetic penalty for pair distances that deviate from @xmath23 , the position of the minimum of the pair potential @xmath2 .",
    "table  [ table_surf ] shows that the increase in the pair energy of the resolidified icosahedra comes chiefly from an increase in the strain energy .",
    "thus , the surface reconstruction of the resolidified icosahedra is able to considerably improve the surface energy via the glue term , incurring a smaller increase in strain energy .",
    "we now wish to examine how the surface reconstruction improves the glue energy .",
    "it is instructive to look at the culmulative contribution to @xmath24 , from pairs with @xmath25 for atoms @xmath5 on the surface ( defined here to be atoms with @xmath26 ) : @xmath27 this quantity , and the corresponding glue energy , are compared in figure  [ rho ] for the 2057-atom cuboctahedron , mackay icosahedron and resolidified icosahedron ( note that the energy curve follows the shape of the @xmath28-curve as @xmath12 is approximately linear away from its minimum ) .",
    "after the contribution to @xmath24 from the first shell ( @xmath29 say ) , the mackay icosahedron has the largest @xmath30 value .",
    "this is to be expected as the mackay icosahedron has only @xmath31 facets at the surface .",
    "however , for the resolidified icosahedron @xmath28 becomes largest beyond @xmath32 where the contribution of the second - nearest neighbors begins to make an impact .",
    "note that since @xmath33 , it is clear from the figure that the resolidified icosahedra will have the lowest glue energy at the surface .",
    "the relatively large contribution from next - nearest neighbors to @xmath4 , arises due to the small difference in energy between the @xmath31 and @xmath34 faces for lead @xcite . while an atom in a @xmath34 face has fewer nearest - neighbors , it has more next - nearest neighbors than an atom in a @xmath31 face .",
    "the glue energy reflects this small difference in energy by weighting the contributions from next - nearest neighbors more heavily than might otherwise be the case @xcite .",
    "this would seem to be the key feature of the potential that stabilizes the novel surface reconstructions of the resolidified icosahedra .    in the next section",
    ", we will explicitly construct new icosahedra from type b and c tetrahedra .",
    "this will enable us to compare these new icosahedra to fcc structures at cluster sizes where it is currently too expensive to conduct repeated resolidification trials .",
    "using the two types of tetrahedra identified in the resolidified icosahedra , we can construct @xmath35 icosahedra .",
    "however , many of the @xmath35 possible icosahedra can be identified after a rotation . in the appendix",
    "[ appendix ] , we show that there are only 17284 unique ways of constructing an icosahedron from the two types of tetrahedron .",
    "this a large configuration space to search for the best arrangement of tetrahedra . however , a pair of clusters which are mirror images of one another will be energetically equivalent i.e. the pair will be chiral isomers .",
    "in fact , there are 1048 of the 17284 clusters which are invariant under reflections , leaving 8488 pairs of chiral isomers .",
    "this reduces the number of energetically distinct clusters to at most 9536 .",
    "further , the resolidification trials detailed in hendy and hall @xcite are a way of sampling this configuration space to discover low - energy clusters .",
    "to construct one of these new icosahedra from scratch , we begin with an @xmath36-shell mackay icosahedra . at faces where type - b tetrahedra are desired , add a further @xmath37-shell mackay icosahedral face , and at faces where type - c tetrahedra are desired , add an @xmath37-shell anti - mackay face . to complete the penultimate shell , mackay icosahedral edges and vertices are added . now to complete the outer shell , add an @xmath38-shell anti - mackay face at faces where type - b tetrahedra are desired ( the corresponding type - b tetrahedra are now layered as ",
    "abcaa ) , and an @xmath39-shell anti - mackay face where type - c tetrahedra are desired ( the corresponding type - c tetrahedra are now layered as ",
    "abccb ) .",
    "the number of atoms in a n - shell icosahedra ( @xmath40 ) constructed as above from @xmath41 type - c tetrahedra and @xmath42 type - b tetrahedra is then given by : @xmath43 the cluster from figure  [ ico - design ] , which was the best structure produced in the trials shown in figure  [ solidtrial ] , has seven type - c tetrahedra and thirteen type - b tetrahedra . with @xmath44 , equation  [ newnumber ] gives a sequence of 309 , 565 , 931 , 1427 , 2073 , 2889 , 3895 , 5111 , 8253  atoms in each closed - shell cluster .",
    "we note that a n - layer type - c tetrahedra contains @xmath45 more atoms than the type - b tetrahedra and , hence a n - shell icosahedron with @xmath41 type - c tetrahedra has @xmath46 more atoms on the surface than an n - shell anti - mackay icosahedron ( which is constructed from 20 type - b tetrahedra ) .",
    "thus , by increasing the proportion of type - c tetrahedra , the density of surface atoms is increased , relative to the anti - mackay icosahedra , as seen in table  [ compare ] .    in table",
    "[ compare ] , the energetics of a 2073-atom @xmath44 cluster , constructed using the design in figure  [ ico - design ] and then relaxed , can be compared to those of a 2057-atom resolidified icosahedron . from the cna - classification of the atoms in these clusters , it is clear that the two clusters are very similar in structure and energetics .",
    "although , we did not explicitly include the extra \\{100}-atoms at the outer edges in the above construction , which appear as cna signature c in the table , these arise as the constructed cluster relaxes .",
    "an interesting feature of the structure of this cluster is that it has a chiral isomer , as the @xmath44 pattern  [ ico - design ] does not have a mirror symmetry .",
    "figure  [ icobest_energy ] shows the energies for a sequence of @xmath44 icosahedra , relative to the cuboctahedra sequence , with the first design given in figure  [ ico - design ] . from figure  [ icobest_energy ]",
    "it appears that this type of icosahedra is the lowest energy structure for sizes from 900 - 5000 .",
    "the largest cluster of this design that lies above the interpolated fit to the truncated octahedra sequence is the 5111-atom cluster .",
    "we have found one other design which appears to be stable at larger sizes .",
    "this design is also shown in figure  [ ico - design ] and has 12 type - c tetrahedra ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the energies of this sequence are shown relative to the cuboctahedron fit in figure  [ icobest_energy ] .",
    "the first energetically favored @xmath47 icosahedron occurs at a size of 5211 atoms .",
    "this sequence continues to give the most energetically favored clusters we have found until a cluster size of 18097 atoms , where the truncated octahedron sequence appears to become more stable .",
    "thus , this sequence gives the most energetically favored structures known from a size of 5211 to 15191 atoms .",
    "we have described a new family of icosahedral structures , which include the anti - mackay icosahedra .",
    "the family is characterized by a mackay icosahedral core and a surface reconstruction that can extend into the two outer layers .",
    "they can be explicitly constructed from two types of fcc tetrahedra : the first type of tetrahedra has an anti - mackay surface termination ( type - b ) , and the second type of tetrahedra has a twin - plane fault in the third - outermost layer ( type - c ) . the anti - mackay icosahedra is constructed entirely from type - b tetrahedra . structures in this family of icosahedra were shown to be the lowest energy structures known for the lead glue potential ( [ glue ] ) for certain sizes .",
    "this study illustrates how new structural forms can arise when many - body effects are included in the interatomic potential .",
    "icosahedra constructed with a sufficient number of type - c tetrahedra possess a density of surface atoms comparable to that of the mackay icosahedra , but without the low coordination atoms at the edges and vertices of a mackay icosahedron .",
    "such a surface reconstruction was shown to be favored by the glue - term in the interatomic potential ( [ glue ] ) over fcc structures largely due to the effects of next - nearest neighbors .",
    "we commented that the relatively large effect that the next - nearest neighbors have on the glue term is due to the small difference in energies between the @xmath48 and @xmath49 faces .",
    "this next - nearest neighbor contribution is also the feature of the potential that favors fcc structures over mackay icosahedra at all sizes , as noted by lim , ong and ercolessi @xcite in their original study of lead clusters .    while we have not exhaustively searched all possible icosahedral structures that are part of this new family , we have identified two configurations of type - b and type - c tetrahedra that show particularly favorable energetics .",
    "the first structure ( which occurs in a pair of chiral isomers ) has seven type - c tetrahedra and is the lowest energy structure known for the potential ( [ glue ] ) over a size range of 900 - 5000 atoms .",
    "the second structure ( which is symmetric under reflection ) has twelve type - c tetrahedra and is the lowest energy structure known for the potential ( [ glue ] ) over a size range of 5000 - 18000 atoms .",
    "thus , above 900 atoms , fcc structures are not favoured by ( [ glue ] ) until at least cluster sizes of 18097 atoms , where the truncated octahedra appears to be favored .",
    "this is probably a conservative lower bound on the size where large fcc structures appear as global minima of the potential ( [ glue ] ) .",
    "these results continue to emphasize the tendency of this potential to produce non - fcc structural forms .",
    "a recent global minimization of this potential for cluster sizes of up to 160 atoms , found that these clusters do not adopt fcc structures at any size in this range @xcite .",
    "further , it seems likely that no globally minimum fcc structure appears in the window between that study and the results presented here ( i.e. between 160 and 900 atoms ) although we have not explicitly demonstrated this here .",
    "simulations of lead nanowires @xcite have also shown the emergence of non - fcc structures . in all these cases , the non - fcc character is related to the small difference in energy between the @xmath48 and @xmath49 faces ( although , disturbingly , it appears that the cut - off distance @xmath50 for the glue energy also plays a role , at least for small clusters @xcite ) .",
    "we have focused here on icosahedral structures because they were produced in the melting and freezing simulations of hendy and hall @xcite . while these structures were found to be lower in energy than other known structures ,",
    "there is no guarantee that they are globally minimum .",
    "indeed , simulations of freezing often produce icosahedral structures preferentially , either for thermodynamic or kinetic reasons , irrespective of whether these structures are globally optimal ( see for example chushak and bartell@xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the novel surface reconstructions seen here may also stabilize decahedral forms , for example , which have not been seen in freezing simulations , but which may compete energetically with the icosahedral structures seen here .",
    "we consider painting an icosahedron using up to n colors , where each face can only be painted a single color .",
    "there are clearly @xmath51 ways to paint the icosahedron , but some of these painted icosahedra will simply be rotations of other painted icosahedra .    to count the number of unique painted icosahedra we use burnside s theorem @xcite .",
    "let @xmath52 be the set of colorings of an icosahedron ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 be the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron ( @xmath55 = 60 , consisting of the identity , 15 @xmath56 rotations about edges , 20 @xmath57 rotations about faces , and 24 @xmath58 rotations about vertices ) .",
    "now for each @xmath59 , we define @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the new coloring obtained by rotating the coloring @xmath62 via the rotation @xmath63 .",
    "now , burnside s theorem gives the number of colorings , @xmath64 , that are unique when acted upon by the finite group @xmath54 : @xmath65 thus , we can determine @xmath64 by determining @xmath66 for each @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , for each @xmath59 , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the number of orbits of faces under @xmath63 . determining the value of @xmath41 for each @xmath63",
    "is straightforward , and can be done using a cardboard cut - out icosahedron ( or counted on a computer ) .",
    "we can also consider n - colored icosahedra under reflections as well as rotations .",
    "the size of the symmetry group is now doubled as we add a generator of reflections to the group : @xmath55 = 120 .",
    "the formula for the number of n - colored icosahedra unique under rotations and reflections is : @xmath71 thus , if we identify mirror images , formula ( [ chiral ] ) applies , and hence the number of 2-colored icosahedra is 9436 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "of the 17824 2-colored icosahedra , 1048 are invariant under reflection symmetry , while the remaining 16776 2-colored icosahedra come in 8388 pairs of mirror images .",
    "the authors wish to thank peter mcgavin for his help with parts of the appendix material .",
    "k. d. is grateful to the royal society for the award of a university research fellowship .",
