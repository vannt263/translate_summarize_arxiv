    "entanglement lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and plays also an important role in the novel field of quantum information theory ( qit , @xcite ) . while for pure quantum states it is equivalent to correlations , for mixed states the two notions differ . in this general case",
    ", a quantum state is entangled if its density matrix can not be written as a convex sum of product states .",
    "based on this definition , several sufficient conditions for entanglement have been developed @xcite . in special cases ,",
    "e.g. for @xmath0 ( two - qubit ) and @xmath1 bipartite systems @xcite and for multi - mode gaussian states @xcite even necessary and sufficient conditions are known .",
    "however , in an experimental situation usually only limited information about the quantum state is available .",
    "only those approaches for entanglement detection can be applied which require the measurement of not too many observables .",
    "one of such approaches is using entanglement witnesses .",
    "they are observables which have a positive expectation value or one that is zero for all separable states .",
    "thus a negative expectation value signals the presence of entanglement .",
    "the theory of entanglement witnesses has recently been rapidly developing @xcite .",
    "it has been shown how to generate entanglement witnesses that detect states close to a given one , even if it is mixed or a bound entangled state @xcite .",
    "it is also known how to optimize a witness operator in order to detect the most entangled states @xcite .    beside constructing entanglement witnesses , it is also important to find a way to measure them .",
    "for example , they can easily be measured by decomposing them into a sum of locally measurable terms @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow a different route .",
    "we will construct witness operators of the form w_o:=o-_s , where @xmath2 is the set of separable states , `` @xmath3 '' denotes infimum , and @xmath4 is a fundamental quantum operator of a spin system which is easy to measure . in the general case",
    "@xmath5 is difficult , if not impossible , to compute @xcite .",
    "thus we will concentrate on operators that contain only two - particle interactions and have certain symmetries .",
    "we derive a general method to find bounds for the expectation value of such operators for separable states .",
    "this method will be applied to spin lattices .",
    "we will also consider models with a different topology .",
    "if observable @xmath4 is taken to be the hamiltonian then our method can be used for detecting entanglement by energy measurement @xcite . while our approach does not require that the system is in thermal equilibrium , it can readily be used to detect entanglement for a range of well - known systems in this case .",
    "the energy bound for separable states correspond to a temperature bound .",
    "below this temperature the thermal state is necessarily entangled .",
    "numerical calculations have been carried out for some familiar spin models .",
    "they show that for the parameter range in which substantial entanglement is present in the thermal ground state , our method detects the state as entangled .",
    "thus our work contributes to recent efforts connecting qit and the statistical physics of spin models @xcite .",
    "we consider a general observable @xmath4 on a spin lattice defined in terms of the pauli spin operators @xmath6 as o:= , [ odef]where @xmath7 is some multi - variable function @xcite .",
    "we will discuss how to find the minimum expectation value of such an operator for separable states of the form @xmath8    the minimum of @xmath9 for pure product states is obtained by replacing the pauli spin matrices by real variables @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ odef ] ) and minimizing it with the constraint that @xmath11 are unit vectors @xcite .",
    "the minimum obtained this way is clearly valid also for mixed separable states since the set of separable states is convex o_:=_s @xmath12= _",
    "\\{^(k ) } .",
    "[ ems ]    in the most general case many - variable minimization is needed for obtaining @xmath13 . in some cases , to which many of the most studied lattice hamiltonians belong , it is possible to find a simple recipe for computing the minimum of @xmath7 .",
    "\\(i ) let us consider an operator @xmath4 which is the sum of two - body interactions .",
    "it can be described by a lattice or a graph .",
    "the vertices @xmath14 correspond to spins and the edges between two vertices indicate the presence of interaction .",
    "\\(ii ) let us assume that this lattice can be partitioned into sublattices in such a way that interacting spins correspond to different sublattices .",
    "[ fig_latt ] shows lattices of some common one- and two - dimensional spin models .",
    "the different symbols at the vertices indicate a possible partitioning into sublattices with the above property . for simplicity ,",
    "next we will consider the case with only two disjoint sublattices , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and assume that @xmath7 can be written in the form = _ _ k^aa,_k^bb f(_k^a,_k^b ) [ htilde ] where @xmath17 is some two - spin function , and @xmath18 denotes spins of sublattice @xmath19 .    if conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are met , then it is enough to find spins @xmath20 and @xmath21 corresponding to the minimum of @xmath22 .",
    "then setting all the spins in sublattice a to @xmath20 and in sublattice b to @xmath21 , respectively , gives a solution which minimizes @xmath7 .",
    "in the following we will use the hamiltonian @xmath23 for constructing entanglement witnesses .",
    "the energy minimum for separable states is the same as the ground state of the corresponding classical spin model .",
    "our method detects entanglement if e:=@xmath24-e_<0 . [ delta ] if @xmath25 then @xmath26 characterizes the state of the system from the point of view of the robustness of entanglement .",
    "it is a lower bound on the energy that the system must receive to become separable .",
    "we will use the previous results to detect entanglement in thermal states of spin models . in thermal equilibrium",
    "the state of the system is given @xmath27 $ ] where @xmath28 is the temperature and @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "for simplicity we will set @xmath30 . using eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) a temperature bound , @xmath31 , can be found such that when @xmath32 then the system is detected as entangled .",
    "let us consider an anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions on a @xmath33-dimensional cubic lattice h_h:=_k , l _",
    "y^(k)_y^(l)+_z^(k)_z^(l)+b_z^(k ) .",

    "this bound is simply the mean - field ground state energy .",
    "it was obtained using two sublattices and minimizing @xmath41 .",

    "for @xmath47 we obtain @xmath48 @xcite .      from a theoretical point of view , it is interesting to consider a system in which the interactions are described by a complete graph rather than a lattice @xcite . for the following hamiltonian of @xmath46 spin-@xmath42 particles",
    "h_s:=j_x^2+j_y^2+j_z^2 the expectation value for separable states is bounded @xcite @xmath49 e_s,:=2n .",

    "( [ smin ] ) follows .",
    "the measured energy even gives information on the entanglement properties of the system .",
    "based on the previous considerations , it can be proved that for pure states @xmath56 is an upper bound for the number of unentangled spins , @xmath57 .",
    "for mixed states of the form @xmath58 we obtain @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 corresponds to the @xmath61th pure subensemble .",
    "following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the concurrence can be computed as a function of the energy .",
    "for even @xmath46 the concurrence is @xmath62/[2n(n-1)],0\\}$ ] . since for all quantum states @xmath63 , the concurrence is zero for any temperature if @xmath64 .",
    "thus our condition can detect multi - qubit entanglement even when two - qubit entanglement is not present .",
    "the thermodynamics of @xmath65 can be obtained by knowing the energy levels and their degeneracies @xcite e_j&=&2j(j+2 ) , + d_j&= & , [ hsspectrum ] where @xmath66 . approximating the binomial in eq .",
    "( [ hsspectrum ] ) by a gaussian and taking the limit @xmath67 while keeping @xmath68 constant we obtain @xmath69 and @xmath70 which is in agreement with our numerical calculations .",
    "thus @xmath31 increases linearly with @xmath46 , the reason being that the number of two - body interaction terms increases quadratically with the system size .",
    "consider now a lattice model , the one - dimensional bose - hubbard model , in which the number of particles can vary on the lattice sites .",
    "we use the language of second - quantization .",
    "each lattice site corresponds to a bosonic mode with a destruction operator @xmath71 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xcite h_b :=- j _ k , l @xmath72_k a_l + a_k @xmath72_l + u _ k @xmath72_k",
    "@xmath72_k a_k a_k , where @xmath73 is the inter - site tunneling and @xmath74 is the on - site interaction . let us consider the case when there is at most a single particle per lattice site ( @xmath75 ) @xcite . then , for separable states the energy is bounded from below as @xmath76 e_b , : = -2jn_b ( 1- ) , [ hb ] where @xmath46 is the number of lattices sites and @xmath77 is the number of bosonic particles . for @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( half filling )",
    "we obtain @xmath80 .",
    "( [ hb ] ) can be proved as follows .",
    "let us consider a site in a pure state @xmath81 such that @xmath82 .",
    "for this single - site state @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "hence @xmath85 . now using @xmath86",
    "one can show that @xmath87 is an energy bound for product states .",
    "it is a bound also for mixed separable states of the form eq .",
    "( [ sep ] ) since @xmath88 is a convex function .",
    "remarkably , the energy minimum for separable states equals the minimum for translationally invariant product states . in other words",
    ", it equals the energy minimum obtained from the gutzwiller ansatz @xcite if the expectation value of particle number is constrained to @xmath89 .",
    "note that for our calculations we assumed that there is at most a single atom per lattice site .",
    "the above methods can be used for entanglement detection in the following ways : ( i ) energy can be directly measured in some systems ( e.g. , optical lattices of cold atoms @xcite when used to realize the bose - hubbard model ) .",
    "( ii ) the temperature can be measured and used for entanglement detection .",
    "( iii ) the expectation value of the hamiltonian can be obtained indirectly if the correlation terms of the hamiltonian are measured .",
    "for example , average correlations @xmath90 ; @xmath91 can be measured in a heisenberg chain realized with two - state bosonic atoms @xcite . from these correlations",
    "@xmath92 can be computed .",
    "in summary , we used the hamiltonian for witnessing entanglement in spin models . we also considered bosonic lattices .",
    "our further results concerning this system will be presented elsewhere @xcite . while our method works for non - equilibrium systems",
    ", we have shown that entanglement can efficiently be detected by measuring energy in a thermal equilibrium .      _",
