    "when electrons pass through a mesoscopic region , the superposition of several different single - particle transport paths can lead to interference , as , e.g. , in an aharonov - bohm geometry with quantum dots embedded in the arms.@xcite as the size of the mesoscopic region diminishes , many - particle effects such as coulomb blockade become increasingly important.@xcite this may change the amplitudes of the competing transport paths and thereby alter the interference effect . eventually , for sufficiently strong many - body interaction , the single - particle - paths picture breaks down and such systems should be treated using a true many - body formalism .",
    "this problem of the interplay between interference of several competing paths and many - body interaction has recently attracted a lot of attention theoretically in the general quantum - transport context @xcite as well as from more specific points of view such as the molecular electronics , @xcite spintronics , @xcite or even full counting statistics@xcite and superconducting transport.@xcite    in the case of spintronics , the interference can be achieved without necessity of a multiply - connected _ orbital _ geometry due to the possibility of superposition of different _ purely spin _ amplitudes with the help of either non - collinearly magnetized leads @xcite or an additional spin - level splitting non - collinear with the lead magnetization . @xcite",
    "since experiments with strongly - interacting quantum dots and ferromagnetic contacts have recently been successfully performed @xcite the spin interference effects proposed in previous work@xcite and further elaborated here may be within experimental reach .",
    "previously , some of us considered a model@xcite consisting of a spin-@xmath0 level coupled to ferromagnetic leads with the magnetizations being either parallel or antiparallel .",
    "in addition , a magnetic field non - collinear with the spin direction of the leads was applied ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] ) .. ]    for this ferromagnetic anderson model with an applied magnetic field @xmath1 ( from now on nicknamed the fab model ) the linear conductance was obtained in two different regimes : without interactions on the dot , and in the cotunneling regime .",

    "that is the anti - resonances around @xmath7 disappear and the conductance vanishes for @xmath14 instead ( see fig .",
    "[ figconductance ] ) .",
    "+    a simple physical picture for the situation described above is : in a basis where the hamiltonian for the isolated dot is diagonal , the bare dot level energy is split by the magnetic field , and for non - interacting electrons the density of states has peaks at the two single - particle energies at @xmath15 , see fig .",
    "[ figtunneling ] .",
    "the widths of the two peaks depend on the angle @xmath6 , and for fully polarized leads they are proportional to @xmath16 or @xmath17 , respectively . for @xmath18 and @xmath14 one of the peaks",
    "is infinitely narrow and electrons can only pass through the other level , whereas for @xmath7 the peaks are equally wide resulting in the sharp anti - resonances due to interference .",
    "so the angular dependence of the conductance can be understood as interference through non - degenerate levels , which have widths depending on the angle between the magnetizations of the leads and the applied magnetic field . for a large on - site coulomb interaction",
    "some weight of the density of states is moved away from the single - particle energies and away from the fermi level , thereby destroying the anti - resonances .     +    the qualitative difference between the interacting and non - interacting regime is important , as it shows a very crucial feature in the transport through mesoscopic systems , namely that it is generally not the single - electron transport paths which determine the transport , but rather many - electron processes .",
    "besides from leading to interesting physical effects , it also puts strong demands on the theoretical transport formalism applied to such systems , as it should be able to handle both the coherence and the interactions .",
    "it also has to be applicable for sufficiently low temperature , because otherwise thermal fluctuations will wash out the interference effect .",
    "that makes our model an excellent benchmark for transport formalisms . including interactions , if they are sufficiently strong , is a challenge in the standard negf formalism where all single - particle effects including the interference are captured exactly . on the other hand , the density matrix language ( generalized master equation ; gme ) starting from exact many - body states of the system , thus including the interaction exactly , faces problems",
    "when the broadening due to the leads comparable with level splitting ( leading to interference effects ) is to be incorporated .",
    "thus , this kind of models poses significant challenges to standard transport approaches even outside notoriously difficult strongly - correlated regimes such as the kondo regime .",
    "therefore , we use this model for a detailed comparison study of the performance of different transport formalisms in the potentially problematic and so far not addressed regime of broadening comparable to the level splitting @xmath19 and arbitrarily strong interaction @xmath10 . in particular , we test the results of higher - order , i.e. beyond mean - field , decoupling schemes based on negf @xcite and/or many - body - states - based negf ( hubbard operator negf ) approaches .",

    "most prominently , full polarization decouples one spin species in a lead completely in the sense that the hopping matrix element between the lead and the resonant level is zero for all angles .",
    "dealing with decoupled hilbert spaces is undesired as it creates numerical problems such as ill - conditioned matrices , making the numerical solution of the resolvent equations hard.@xcite    furthermore , there are single points where the model itself is ill - defined for full polarization . at the angles @xmath18 and @xmath14 the spin - flip process of the dot is inactive because of the prefactor @xmath66 . due to the full polarization also",
    "the hopping matrix element for the minority spin connecting the lead and the dot is zero . thus the minority spin level is completely decoupled and hence has a constant occupation .",
    "the occupation of the majority spin level depends , however , on the occupation of the minority spin level through the on - site coulomb interaction term @xmath67 .",
    "that is the properties of the model for these specific angles depend on the initial occupation of the minority spin level , and no unique stationary state exists .",
    "it should be noted that the qualitative behavior for ( large ) partial and full polarization are similar except for the problem for specific angles described above .",
    "it is , however , clear that a decreased polarization in the leads tends to wash out the spin dependence in the model , and in the limit of unpolarized leads all spin characteristics are lost .",

    "although the polarization is a property of the leads , it can be modeled by spin - dependent hopping matrix elements connecting the dot to the leads.@xcite there are different approaches to modeling the polarization of the leads and we have chosen the simplest one to implement in the dmrg setup .",
    "rather than using spin - dependent _ filling _ in the leads , we use half - filled leads for both spin species , and model the polarization by modifying the hopping matrix elements connecting the leads and the dot .",
    "this is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fab : dmrg setup figure ] , where we show the dmrg setup using a momentum - space representation of the leads .",
