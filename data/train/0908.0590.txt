    "the essence of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is the macroscopic occupation of a single - particle state@xmath0 .",
    "the achievement of bec in dilute atomic gases has enabled the study of the long - range spatial coherence in a well - controlled environment@xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to the extremely low temperatures needed for dilute atom gases , excitons in semiconductors have long been considered a candidate for bec at temperatures of a few kelvin , due to their light effective mass@xmath2 . in the past few decades",
    ", numerous studies have shown evidence@xmath3 for the existence of excitonic bec .",
    "a recent promising realization for such a bec is within a two - dimensional quantum well in a microcavity , i.e. , _ _ a condensate of polaritons__@xmath4 , which are half - light , half - matter bosonic quasi - particles .",
    "fascinating features of condensate polaritons , such as phase interference@xmath5 , quantized vortices@xmath6 , bogoliubov excitations@xmath7 , and collective fluid dynamics@xmath8 , have been successfully observed in experiments .    in a context related to the study of semiconductor microcavities , an exciton in a quantum dot ( qd ) embedded inside a microcavity",
    "can be used to study the phenomena of cavity quantum electrodynamics@xmath9 . with the advances of fabrication and measuring technologies , strong couplings between the qd excitons and cavity photons",
    "have been observed both in a semiconductor microcavity@xmath10 and in a photonic crystal nanocavity@xmath11 .",
    "another unique feature of artificial atoms , such as qds , is that they can be connected to electronic reservoirs .",
    "for example , it is now possible to embed qds inside a _ p - i - n _ structure@xmath12 , such that electrons and holes can be injected separately from opposite sides .",
    "this allows one to examine the exciton dynamics in a qd via electrical currents@xmath13 .    motivated by these recent developments ,",
    "we propose a method to detect the bec of polaritons via an electrical current by embedding a qd _ _",
    "p - i - n__junction inside a microcavity , where the condensation of polaritons takes place .",
    "this is in principle feasible since the excitation energy of the qd exciton ( two - level spacing ) is comparable to that of the cavity photons .",
    "once the condensation of polaritons occurs , the one - to - one correspondence between the polariton and its half - light part ( photon ) ensures that the photons also condense to their ground state . in this case",
    ", the transport current through the dot should `` feel '' the condensation .",
    "we will show that the contribution to the _ coherent _ transport of the current increases with the condensate fraction .",
    "furthermore , if the qd is coupled to two condensates , the current - noise can reveal the phase interference between them .",
    "consider now a qd _ p - i - n _ junction embedded inside a semiconductor microcavity , where the quantum well excitons and cavity photons condense to their ground state as shown in fig .",
    "when this condensation occurs , a great number of polaritons , @xmath14 , will occupy the zero - momentum state @xmath15 .",
    "the canonical transformation@xmath0    @xmath16    is commonly used to describe @xmath17 condensed particles and non - condensate particles with operator @xmath18 .",
    "the polariton operator @xmath14 is composed of the exciton operator , @xmath19 , and photon operator , @xmath20 ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are coefficients easily obtained from the diagonalization of exciton - photon interaction@xmath24 . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we can see that there is a one - to - one correspondence of the polariton operator to the photon one .",
    "therefore , the canonical transformation in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can also be applied to the photon operator : @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the photons not in the zero momentum state .",
    "the photon condensate fraction @xmath27 is related to @xmath17 via the particular choice of the diagonalization in eq .",
    "( 2 ) .    in this case ,",
    "the exciton - photon interaction in the qd _ p - i - n _ junction , @xmath28 , can now be written as@xmath29where @xmath30 , with @xmath31 being the coupling strength between the dot exciton and the cavity photon .",
    "the index @xmath15 represents the condensate ground state .",
    "we have essentially assumed a mean - field interaction , so that the field of the condensate mode is just represented by a @xmath32-number : there is no backaction from the qd to the cavity . from the theory of transport through qds , the first term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) represents _ coherent _ tunneling@xmath33 , while the second term describes _ incoherent _ tunneling@xmath13 . here , we have introduced the three dot states : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 means that there is one hole in the qd ,  @xmath38 is the exciton state , and @xmath39 represents the ground state with no hole and no electron in the qd@xmath13 .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the tunneling to the electron and hole reservoirs can thus be written as@xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the electron operators in the electron and hole reservoirs , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath43 and @xmath44 couple the channel with momentum @xmath45 of the electron and the hole reservoirs .",
    "one can now write the equation of motion for the reduced density operator :    @xmath46-\\mathrm{tr}_{\\mathrm{res}}\\int_{0}^{t}dt^{\\prime } [ h_{\\mathrm{incoh}}(t )   \\notag \\\\ & & + h_{t}(t),[h_{\\mathrm{incoh}}(t^{\\prime } ) + h_{t}(t^{\\prime } ) , \\widetilde{\\xi } ( t^{\\prime } ) ] ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the total density operator , and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) represents the coherent ( incoherent ) tunneling in eq .",
    "note that the trace , @xmath50 , in eq .",
    "( 5 ) is taken with respect to both the non - condensate photons and the electronic reservoirs .",
    "if the couplings to the non - condensate photons and to the electron / hole reservoirs are weak , then it is reasonable to assume that the standard born - markov approximation with respect to these couplings is valid . in this case , one can derive a master equation from the exact time - evolution of the system and obtain the tunnel current through the hole - side barrier@xmath13 : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the tunneling rate from the hole side reservoir .    in the steady state limit ( @xmath54 ) , the analytical expression for the tunneling current @xmath55",

( 6 ) we note that , when the condensation number @xmath27(@xmath63 ) becomes relatively large , the steady - state current @xmath64 saturates to the value :    @xmath65    depending only on the values of the tunneling rates @xmath59 and @xmath53 . in the opposite limit of no condensation , eq . ( 6 ) is reduced to the result of incoherent case@xmath66 : @xmath67the curve in the inset of fig .",
    "2 shows that the current @xmath55  increases when increasing the occupation number @xmath27 .",
    "such a phenomenon may be observed by increasing the power of the laser excitation , as has been performed in experiments@xmath4 .",
    "note that in the inset of fig . 2 and the following figures , we have set the exciton bandgap @xmath68 @xmath69  and the tunneling rates : @xmath70 @xmath71 .",

    "@xmath79 is the coupling strength between the dot exciton and the cavity photon .  ]",
    "another important effect that can be examined is the interference between two condensates , which has been observed and verified in dilute atomic gases@xmath80 .",
    "consider now an additional quantum well in the microcavity , so that the excitons in this well also form a condensate with the photons .",
    "the interactions experienced by the _",
    "p - i - n _ junction experiences can be described by@xmath81where the two phases @xmath82 and @xmath83 come from the @xmath84 symmetry - breaking of the two condensates . assuming that the exciton - photon couplings of the two wells are identical",

    "we also suggest that the _ p - i - n _ junction can be embedded inside an array of polariton condensates connected by weak periodic potential barriers@xmath5 , where the in - phase ( ` zero - state ' ) and anti - phase ( ` @xmath91-state ' ) have been created . in this case , eqs .",

    "( i.e. , the _ zero - frequency noise _ divided by the current ) as a function of @xmath94 for different values of the incoherent decay rate @xmath60 .",
    "one clearly finds that the magnitude of the central peak decreases when increasing @xmath60 .",
    "as the incoherent process dominates due to the non - condensate photons overwhelming the coherent ones , therefore the fano factor reduces to the usual sub - poissonian limit@xmath132 . in the opposite limit ( @xmath133 ) , the fano factor approaches unity , i.e. the poissonian value , demonstrating that  the revealing feature of destructive interference is a peak in the fano factor ( at @xmath134 ) , coinciding with the dip in the steady - state current observed in fig .",
    "an alternative way to detect the condensation of polaritons via electron transport is by directly embedding the quantum well between a _",

    ", we have shown that a single qd _",
    "p - i - n _ junction can serve as a mini - detector@xmath135 inside the quantum structure , such that the features of condensation and interference can be readout via the electrical current and current - noise .    we would like to thank s. a. gurvitz for helpful discussions .",
