    "for a quite long time since the appearance of heisenberg uncertainty relation in @xmath0 the gravitational interaction between photon and the particle being observed has not been considered as it is usually assumed to be negligible .",
    "but at increasingly large energies this interaction becomes more and more important .",
    "the main conceptual point concerning gup is that there is an additional uncertainty in quantum measurement due to gravitational interaction .",
    "we focus on different considerations of this problem presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both of these considerations rely on classical gravitational theory .",
    "let us give here a brief critical review of gup that comes from the general arguments of quantum mechanics and gravity .",
    "we set @xmath1 in what follows .",
    "the idea based on micro - black hole _ gedanken _",
    "experiment goes as follows @xcite . as it was derived by heisenberg the uncertainty in the position of the electron when it interacts with the photon",
    "is given by @xmath2 @xcite . by taking in the high energy situation @xmath3",
    "the heisenberg relation takes the form @xmath4 .",
    "so that to measure the position of electron more precisely the energy of photon should be increased . but this procedure is limited because there is the gravitational radius associated with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , for which the @xmath7 becomes greater than @xmath8 for @xmath9 and therefore the region where @xmath5 is located becomes hidden by the event horizon .",
    "( @xmath10 is the four - dimensional newton s constant ) .",
    "based on this discussion the combination of the above inequalities gives @xmath11 the eq.([genunp ] ) implies a minimal attainable uncertainty in position @xmath12 . while in ordinary quantum mechanics @xmath8 can be made arbitrarily small by letting @xmath5 grow correspondingly . combining the eq.([genunp ] ) into a single one in the linear way one gets the expression similar to what was obtained previously in the string theory framework @xcite @xmath13 the approach proposed in @xcite is to calculate the displacement of electron caused by the gravitational interaction with the photon and add it to the position uncertainty .",
    "the photon due to gravitational interaction imparts to electron the acceleration given by @xmath14 .",
    "assuming @xmath15 is the size of the interaction region the variation of the velocity of the electron is given by @xmath16 and correspondingly @xmath17 .",
    "therefore the total uncertainty in the position is given by @xmath18    as one sees the mechanisms proposed in @xcite and @xcite giving rise to the gravitational uncertainty are quite distinct though they provide qualitatively the same gravitational uncertainty term which in general has to be taken with some numerical factor of order unity @xcite . at a first glance they complement one another in that for energies @xmath19 the gup",
    "is given by eq.([genunpn ] ) while for @xmath20 one can take the second mechanism eq.([lcgup ] ) as it was proposed in @xcite .",
    "but to be more precise the collapse of @xmath5 puts simply the limitation on the measurement procedure .",
    "so in principle it is no longer conceivable for @xmath20 to proceed the measurement .",
    "the minimum position uncertainty then becomes @xmath21 .",
    "let us make a straightforward generalization of the ideas given in the preceding section to a higher dimensional case .",
    "the @xmath22 dimensional black hole has the form @xcite",
    "@xmath23    with @xmath24}{(n+2)\\,2 \\pi^{(n+3)/2}}~,\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath25 stands for the @xmath26-dimensional newton s constant and @xmath27 denotes the volume of a @xmath28 dimensional unit sphere .",
    "the higher dimensional newton s law has the form    @xmath29",
    ".the region where the collapse of @xmath5 occurs is given by ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "`` length '' denotes the minimal position uncertainty and `` mass '' stands for the minimal black hole mass that follows from the minimal observable length .",
    "all quantities given here are written in the planck units . [ cols=\"^,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     correspondingly the electron will experience an acceleration due to gravity @xmath31 as it follows from the standard quantum mechanical uncertainty relations the characteristic time and length scales for interaction are given by @xmath32 when the energy @xmath5 is used for the measurement @xcite",
    ". then the variation of velocity and the displacement of electron are given by @xmath33 the derivation of gravitational uncertainty term is somewhat rough in that , in general , it may contain some numerical multiplier , which for the stringy induced gup is of order unity @xcite .",
    "considering simply the linear combination , the total uncertainty in the position takes the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is some numerical factor mentioned above . the eq.([exdgup ] ) predicts the minimum position uncertainty @xmath36 which takes place for @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "but as we remember from the preceding section further increase of energy can result the collapse of @xmath5 if two times the gravitational radius exceeds the @xmath8 . in this case",
    "it was suggested in @xcite to take the uncertainty term as two times the gravitational radius @xmath39\\delta e}{(n+2)\\,2 \\pi^{(n+3)/2}}\\right)^{1/(1+n)}~.\\ ] ] thus , in higher dimensional case the two approaches @xcite ,  @xcite give qualitatively different answers in contrast to the four dimensional one .",
    "one can see that the careful consideration gives the higher - dimensional gup different from that one obtained previously in @xcite where the eq.([uncergrrad ] ) was assumed for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "let us not to go into details of the extra - dimensional models @xcite but merely recall a few common features relevant for our consideration .",
    "the common features are a low fundamental planck scale @xmath40tev , the localization of the standard model particles on the brane and propagation of gravity throughout the higher dimensional space .",
    "there is a length scale @xmath41 , much greater than tev@xmath42 , beneath of which the gravitational interaction has the form eq.([exnew ] ) while beyond this scale we have the standard four - dimensional law . in what follows",
    "we restrict ourselves to the add model .    from the above discussion one",
    "gets the following expression for gup    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is of order unity @xcite and @xmath45 has to be determined by the junction of these inequalities at @xmath46 . in this way one gets @xmath47 as it was mentioned in the first section ,",
    "the gup obtained in the framework of string theory coincides with a model - independent derivation based on the general considerations of quantum mechanics and gravity . however , as it is shown in section two , the latter approach gives the higher - dimensional gup different from that one obtained in four - dimensional case and gup on the brane incorporates both of them eq.([genonb ] ) .",
    "for the add model the size and number of extra dimensions are related as follows @xmath48 cm .",
    "so in this case one finds @xmath49 and @xmath50 as it follows from eq.([minobdis ] ) .",
    "however , the minimal observable distance is determined rather due to collapse of @xmath5 than merely by the eq.([minobdis ] ) .",
    "it is natural because the collapse of @xmath51 puts simply the bound on the measurement procedure . in this way for minimal observable lengths and the black hole remnant",
    "masses one finds the values represented in table i.",
    "it is widely believed that if the fundamental scale of gravity actually lies in the tev range a very spectacular prediction can be made about the creation of small black holes at colliders or in high - energy cosmic ray interactions @xcite .",
    "the size of black hole produced in this way is typically assumed to be much smaller than the characteristic length of extra dimensions",
    ". then it seems reasonable to describe such objects by higher dimensional schwarzschild solution eq.([hdschs ] ) .",
    "model : the mass of the black hole versus time in planck units.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    once produced , the black hole would decay very rapidly to a spectrum of particles by hawking radiation . for mass shedding formula in @xmath26 dimensional space - time , under assumption that the black hole emits mainly the massless particles we have the following expression @xcite    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denotes the @xmath26 dimensional stefan - boltzmann constant @xmath55 since only gravity is allowed to propagate in the bulk , @xmath56 simply counts the number of polarization states of the graviton , namely @xmath57    in the framework of heuristic approach @xcite to the hawking radiation the black hole is envisioned as a cube with size two times the gravitational radius , inner space of which is inaccessible for outer observable , and the characteristic energy of the emitted particles is estimated with the use of gup .",
    "then the lower value of energy obtained in this way is identified with the radiation temperature @xmath58 the main observation achieved in the framework of this approach is that at the planck scale black hole ceases to radiate , even though its temperature reaches a maximum .",
    "it can not radiate further and becomes an inert remnant of about planck mass .",
    "the problem of brane - localized mini black hole evaporation was studied in the framework of stringy induced gup in @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the gup derived in the preceding section . from the expression of gup",
    "derived in section three one sees that its effect on the hawking temperature becomes negligibly small for the add model .",
    "the figure 1 shows the mass decay of the black hole with initial mass @xmath59 for add model with @xmath60 .",
    "the corresponding lifetime is estimated as @xmath61 . without gup one",
    "obtains practically the same result .",
    "following to the papers @xcite we have defined the gup on the brane which is further used for evaluating of evaporation of brane - localized mini black holes in the framework of heuristic approach given in @xcite . as it is shown for add model the gup effect on the black hole evaporation is strongly suppressed because of small @xmath45 factor .",
    "we have also evaluated the masses of the black hole remnants the existence of which increase the lower cutoff for the black hole production reducing therefore the rate of corresponding events .    in regard with the gup approach to the black hole evaporation",
    "a few remarks are in order . in general , gup assumes two values of @xmath5 for a given @xmath8 . in four - dimensional case",
    "the situation may be somewhat simplified by omitting the branch @xmath20 in gup as it corresponds to the collapse of @xmath5 ( see section one ) . in this regard",
    "the situation in presence of extra dimensions is more complicated because the region of collapse of @xmath5 , given by @xmath62 , is bounded .",
    "only the lower value of @xmath5 is applicable to the black hole radiation for it gives the correct asymptotic dependence of the hawking temperature on the black hole mass .",
    "the question naturally arises is why the nature selects the lower one in the case of black hole emission whereas in the framework of gup both of the solutions have the same right of existence .",
    "so we face the challenge of understanding what is the status of that part of the gup corresponding to the higher values of @xmath5 .",
    "does the nature uses the higher value of @xmath5 instead of the lower one in some cases ?",
    "if so , what is the intrinsic principle that selects which solution of gup should be used for a given process ?",
    "also it is necessary to know what are the properties of remnants left behind the black hole evaporation in the gup approach .",
    "another important point is the quantum gravity effects since gup takes into account the gravitational interactions at the planck scale @xcite .",
    "moreover , the black hole remnant may be rather due to quantum gravitational effects ( the nature of which is well established in this case @xcite ) than the gup @xcite .",
    "( certainly , a big obstacle so far is the lack of a direct experimental hint that there is a need for a quantum theory of gravity ) .",
    "the authors are indebted to the participants of seminar at the chair of theoretical physics , tbilisi state university , for useful discussions .",
