    "the kondo effect has been fundamental in furthering our understanding of strong correlations in condensed matter physics . first observed some 80 years ago , the anomalous behavior of the low - temperature resistivity of dilute magnetic alloys can be understood as the many - body screening of magnetic moments in a metal .",
    "this screening occurs via quasiparticle spin exchange well below the kondo temperature @xmath1 . during the last decades the interest in the kondo effect has revived following its discovery in quantum dots based on semiconductors , carbon nanotubes and nanowires .",
    "quantum dots behave as magnetic impurities but , in contrast to real ones , are fully tunable such that kondo physics can be controlled in precise detail .",
    "interestingly , hybrid devices based on quantum dots coupled to superconductors can also be fabricated and the physics of magnetic impurities in a superconductor can be studied in an unprecedented manner .",
    "a characteristic feature of these systems is the presence of sub - gap excitations , the so - called yu - shiba - rusinov ( ysr ) bound states or simply shiba states , that appear owing to the pair - breaking effects that magnetic moments have on superconductivity .",
    "their physical meaning can be understood already at the level of a classical spin @xmath3 exchange - coupled to the superconductor by a coupling @xmath4 .",
    "this interaction gives rise to an effective magnetic field @xmath5 which lowers the energy for quasiparticle excitations by an amount : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the normal state density of states at the fermi energy and @xmath0 is the superconducting gap . for weak exchange , @xmath8 ,",
    "the ground state is a standard bcs wave function , with all single particle states forming cooper pairs , plus an unscreened impurity spin .",
    "single quasiparticle excitations on top of this ground state , as described by eq .",
    ", occur at energies close to the gap .",
    "for large enough @xmath4 , however , @xmath9 can cross zero energy such that the state with one unpaired quasiparticle , which is a non - bcs state , becomes the new ground state .",
    "zero energy crossings of the yrs state thus signal a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) where _ the fermionic parity of the ground state changes _ .",
    "quantum fluctuations lead to a very complex scenario since exchange is mediated by kondo processes . in a superconductor",
    "no quasiparticles are available below the gap @xmath0 , hence kondo screening is incomplete . to analyze all possible ground states ,",
    "let us consider a single , spin - degenerate quantum impurity level coupled to a superconductor .",
    "in general , two spin states are possible : a spin doublet ( spin 1/2 ) , @xmath10 and a spin singlet ( spin zero ) , @xmath11 .",
    "the latter can be of two types ( apart from the standard cooper pairs of the bcs ground state ) : kondo - like superpositions between the spin doublet and bogoliubov quasiparticles in the superconductor and bcs - like superpositions of zero and doubly occupied states of the impurity level ( fig .  ) . in the weak kondo coupling regime ( @xmath12 ) , the ground state is the doublet while kondo - like singlet excitations give rise to ysr bound states ( assuming large on - site interaction @xmath13 , such that the bcs - like singlets are higher in energy than the kondo ones , fig .  ) .",
    "the position in energy of these ysr excitations smoothly evolves from @xmath14 towards positions close to the fermi level when @xmath15 . at larger @xmath1 , the yrs cross zero energy and the system undergoes a parity - changing qpt where the new ground state is now the kondo singlet .",
    "experimentally , these complicated correlations can be determined by the transport spectroscopy of a quantum dot ( qd ) coupled to , both , a superconductor and a weak normal lead ( fig .  ) .",
    "sub - gap features in the differential conductance of this setup can be directly ascribed to ysrs .",
    "zero bias anomalies ( zba)s , in particular , mark qpt parity crossings .",
    "more recently , subgap states have attracted a great deal of attention in the context of topological superconductors containing majorana bound states ( mbs ) .",
    "these mbs are far more elusive than standard yrs and were predicted to appear as zero - energy bound states in effective spinless p - wave nanostructures , such as the ones resulting from the combined action of spin - orbit coupling and zeeman splitting in nanowires proximized with s - wave superconductors .",
    "these nanowire devices , very similar to the ones where the ysr parity crossings have been reported , see , e. g. , refs . [ ] or [ ] , are expected to become topological superconductors when the following criterion is satisfied @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the zeeman energy ( @xmath18 is the @xmath18- factor and @xmath19 is the bohr magneton ) , @xmath20 is the proximity - induced superconducting pairing , and @xmath21 is the chemical potential .",
    "indeed , recent experiments have reported zbas in transport through proximized nanowires that can be interpreted as signatures of majorana states .",
    "alternative explanations involving kondo physics and the associated ysr states were dismissed based on the expected shifts with increasing magnetic field @xmath22 .    as we will discuss in this work , however , the interplay of strong coulomb interaction , zeeman splitting , as well as the hybridization to the normal - state tunneling probe , leads to unanticipated manifestations of kondo physics , similar to the signatures of majorana states . for ysr and mbs alike , the zero - bias anomalies can be induced by the magnetic field and split into two peaks under certain circumstances . for mbs",
    ", the field plays the crucial role of rendering the system effectively spinless , while the subsequent splitting could be due to finite - size effects . for ysrs , the field can induce parity crossings in two ways : through the kondo effect ( by reducing the gap so that @xmath23 ) or via zeeman splitting of ysrs .",
    "the analysis is additionally complicated by the presence of the tunneling probe which not only trivially broadens the sub - gap bound states into resonances of finite width , but also leads to further kondo screening .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that zeeman - induced crossings in very short quantum - dot - like noninteracting nanowires smoothly evolve towards the true mbs as the wire becomes longer .",
    "along similar lines , recent proposals have discussed the possibility of obtaining mbss in chains of magnetic atoms deposited on top of superconducting surfaces . in such proposals ,",
    "the ysr bound states on each impurity overlap considerably and form a shiba band along the chain . remarkably",
    ", this shiba band can support a topological phase with end mbs , which is yet another example where ysr bound states smoothly evolve towards mbs .",
    "the recent experimental observations reported in ref . using spatially resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveal the existence of nearly zero - energy quasi - bound energy states that , however , are too localized to be reconciled with the shiba band picture of majorana end states .",
    "a recent theoretical work considers a linear chain of anderson impurities on a superconductor as the minimal model that might explain the strong localization . while the above works suggest an interesting connection between the physics of magnetic impurities in superconductors and mbs , they neglect quantum fluctuations ( and hence kondo physics ) , which are essential for a proper understanding of the ysr bound states .",
    "this state of affairs motivates a detailed study of the minimal anderson model incorporating both superconducting lead and normal - state tunneling probe , and fully taking into account quantum fluctuations for an arbitrary ratio of the gap to the kondo temperature .",
    "while many theoretical papers have already studied transport in normal - quantum dot - superconductor system , the precise role that the coupling @xmath24 to the normal lead has on the phase diagram ( beyond trivial broadening effects ) remains largely unknown .",
    "the presence of the tunneling probe not only trivially broadens the sub - gap bound states into resonances of finite width , but also leads to further kondo screening that generates an additional spectral peak pinned to zero frequency .    to address the investigation of the ysr subgap states in this minimal hybrid normal - superconductor anderson model",
    ", we employ a sophisticated and almost _ exact _ theoretical technique : _ the numerical renormalization group _ ( nrg ) .",
    "the only nrg calculations of the system studied here were performed in the @xmath25 limit , which is unsuitable for understanding realistic experimental situations ( arbitrary ratios @xmath26 ) since they exclude all effects of the quasiparticles in the superconductor .",
    "we discuss the equilibrium properties of hybrid qd systems such as the local density of states of the quantum dot that provides useful information for the interpretation of experimental findings for the nonlinear conductance .",
    "some of our main results are summarized in fig .  .",
    "weak coupling to the normal lead , usually considered to be just a non - perturbing tunneling probe that may be ignored in the calculations , changes the phase diagram considerably by replacing the sharp doublet - singlet quantum phase transition line with a very broad cross - over region with properties intermediate between those in the respective limits .",
    "the spectral functions exhibit a rich phenomenology with zero bias anomalies of different origins . in the doublet ( d ) regime , where the impurity would remain unscreened for @xmath27 down to zero temperature",
    ", there is a needle - like resonance due to a kondo effect with very low kondo temperature @xmath28 , which may already have been observed .",
    "here @xmath29 is the kondo temperature associated with the screening from the weakly coupled normal - state lead , while @xmath1 is the standard kondo temperature associated with the screening from the strongly - coupled superconducting lead . during the doublet - singlet ( ds ) cross - over the shiba resonances merge with the needle kondo peak to produce an enhanced zba of large amplitude . in the singlet ( s )",
    "regime , this resonance splits into two shiba states and there is no needle - like feature . in this regime ,",
    "the magnetic field induces further zba through zeeman splitting of the doublet ysr state , see fig .  .",
    "we derive the analytical condition for the occurrence of these zeeman - induced fermion - parity switches in the presence of interactions .",
    "interestingly , the equation describing these fermion - parity switches , eq .  , bears unexpected similarities to the inequality for mbs formation in nanowires .",
    "this work is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the model and provide some details about the numerical technique . in sec .",
    "iii we present the results for the modifications of the phase diagram induced by the normal - state lead . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the effect of finite temperatures and in sec .  v those of the external magnetic field . apart from nrg numerical results , this section also contains an analytical derivation of the condition for zeeman - induced parity crossings in the presence of interactions .",
    "some additional technical details are provided in the appendices .",
    "they include a detailed discussion about the definition of the cross - over lines in the phase diagram ( appendix a ) and a schrieffer - wolff transformation including both normal and superconducting leads ( appendix b ) .",
    "the physical system under consideration is a nanodevice ( such as a segment of a nanowire ) where charge can be trapped under the effect of electric potentials .",
    "if the number of confined electrons is small , such that the separation between the energy levels is non - negligible , the device can be considered as a quantum dot . in the simplest case , there will be a single orbital .",
    "this orbital hybridizes with a superconducting substrate as well as with a tunneling probe , and it is exposed to an external magnetic field .",
    "we thus consider the following anderson impurity model ( see the schematic representation in fig .  )",
    "@xmath30    @xmath31 creates an electron in the normal or superconducting lead ( @xmath32 is the channel index ) and @xmath33 at the impurity level .",
    "the impurity occupation is @xmath34 with @xmath35 , while its spin is @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the impurity level and @xmath39 the on - site repulsion , measures deviations from the particle - hole symmetry when the occupancy is fixed exactly at 1 . here , for simplicity",
    ", we shall focus on electron - hole symmetric configurations @xmath40 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "the coupling between the impurity and the leads is described by the amplitudes @xmath41 which define two tunneling rates : @xmath42 ) .",
    "the present problem is at the very boarder of the currently feasible nrg computations .",
    "we employ an iterative diagonalization scheme which consists of including a single site from the wilson chains in each nrg step , alternatively from the superconducting and from the normal - state lead ; we have verified that the difference compared to the conventional approach where two sites are included at once is inconsequential ( differences of a few percent ) . here",
    "this approach works very well because the two channels have very asymmetric coupling and are different in nature , thus the alternating site adding does not lead to the breaking of the energy - scale separation that is necessary in the nrg approach .",
    "the discretization parameter was @xmath43 and we typically kept up to 6000 multiplets per nrg iteration .",
    "we made use of the spin symmetry : su(2 ) in the absence of field , u(1 ) in its presence .",
    "the spectral function is calculated using the full - density matrix algorithm which is the most reliable approach at finite temperatures .",
    "all relevant physical quantities can be extracted from the qd green s functions in the nambu space defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the spectral function @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fourier transform of the qd retarded green s function , namely @xmath49 the doublet - singlet transition can be characterized by the changes in the anomalous spectral function @xmath50 of the anomalous component of the propagator @xmath51    for computing spectral functions we performed averaging over @xmath52 interleaved discretization grids .",
    "since the impurity is coupled to both normal - state and superconducting channels , we performed the broadening using a standard log - gaussian scheme with @xmath53 .",
    "for @xmath27 , large @xmath39 favors a doublet ground state : in the analytically solvable @xmath25 limit , the doublet phase occurs for @xmath54 below the line @xmath55 for finite @xmath0 , the ds transition needs to be computed numerically ( black line with circles in fig .  ) .",
    "large @xmath0 favors a superconducting singlet state , while for smaller @xmath0 kondo correlations mediated by quasiparticles above the superconducting gap are also possible and the singlet becomes predominantly of kondo character as @xmath54 increases . in this section",
    "we discuss how this picture is modified by the presence of the normal - state lead .",
    "we describe different criteria for identifying the doublet - singlet cross - over region , the origin of the additional zero - bias anomalies , and provide numerical results for the @xmath24 dependence .      for @xmath56",
    ", kondo screening leads to a singlet ground state for all parameter values .",
    "we emphasise that this is a statement about the true zero - temperature ground state and that the characteristic temperature scale for reaching such a ground state can be exponentially low , thus experimentally irrelevant . in such circumstances , it is more important to understand the properties at intermediate experimentally relevant temperature scales .",
    "we find that the sharp ds quantum phase transition for @xmath57 is replaced at @xmath58 by a smooth cross - over between the `` singlet '' and `` doublet regimes '' which can be empirically distinguished by analogy with the @xmath27 case in several ways :    1 .",

    "<S> hybrid semiconductor - superconductor systems are interesting melting pots where various fundamental effects in condensed matter physics coexist . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when a quantum dot is coupled to a superconducting electrode two very distinct phenomena , superconductivity and the kondo effect , compete . as a result of this competition , the system undergoes a quantum phase transition when the superconducting gap @xmath0 is of the order of the kondo temperature @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying physics behind such transition ultimately relies on the physics of the anderson model where the standard metallic host is replaced by a superconducting one , namely the physics of a ( quantum ) magnetic impurity in a superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> a characteristic feature of this hybrid system is the emergence of sub - gap bound states , the so - called yu - shiba - rusinov ( ysr ) states , which cross zero energy across the quantum phase transition , signaling a switching of the fermion parity and spin ( doublet or singlet ) of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , similar hybrid devices based on semiconducting nanowires with spin - orbit coupling may host exotic zero - energy bound states with majorana character . </S>",
    "<S> both , parity crossings and majorana bound states ( mbs)s , are experimentally marked by zero bias anomalies in transport , which are detected by coupling the hybrid device with an extra normal contact . </S>",
    "<S> we here demonstrate theoretically that this extra contact , usually considered as a non - perturbing tunneling weak probe , leads to nontrivial effects . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is supported by numerical renormalization group calculations of the phase diagram of an anderson impurity coupled to both superconducting and normal - state leads . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain this phase diagram for an arbitrary ratio @xmath2 for the first time , which allows us to analyze relevant experimental scenarios , such as parity crossings as well as novel kondo features induced by the normal lead , as this ratio changes . </S>",
    "<S> spectral functions at finite temperatures and magnetic fields , which can be directly linked to experimental tunneling transport characteristics , show zero - energy anomalies irrespective of whether the system is in the doublet or singlet regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive the analytical condition for the occurrence of zeeman - induced fermion - parity switches in the presence of interactions which bears unexpected similarities with the condition for emergent mbss in nanowires . </S>"
