    "rpa is one of the basic tools to study the nuclear vibrational excitations",
    ". the basic theory is well known , and several versions have been implemented since the early days of nuclear structure studies . however , while in the past the underlying mean field and the residual particle - hole ( p - h ) interactions were often purely empirical , nowadays self - consistent hf plus rpa calculations are feasible with quite sophisticated effective forces . the importance of these calculations stems from the possibility of testing their predictive power , e.g. , when going towards neutron - rich ( or neutron - deficient ) isotopes that can be studied at present or future radioactive beam facilities .",
    "one of the advantages of rpa is that it is a conserving theory , that is , the symmetries of the hamiltonian that are broken at the hf level are in principle restored in rpa .",
    "the detailed way in which this restoration is realized has been already widely discussed in the literature .",
    "the reader can consult standard textbooks ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) or review papers like ref . @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is not to re - discuss basic questions .",
    "we shall focus instead on practical issues , in the case of the restoration of translational symmetry ( which is associated with the appearance of a zero - energy translational mode in the rpa @xmath0 spectrum ) .    in practice , it is impossible to obtain this translational mode at _ exactly _ zero energy due to some theoretical or numerical approximation . if we restrict ourselves to the case of nonrelativistic calculations performed with effective skyrme forces , no fully self - consistent calculations that treat the continuum exactly are available .",
    "fully self - consistent calculations in which the continuum is discretized do exist @xcite , and in this case the energy of the spurious translational mode goes to zero as the dimension of the box in which the system is set increases . both in this case , and in the case of continuum calculations which are the object of our study , one has then to deal with the spurious contamination of several quantities .",
    "in fact , if the spurious state from a numerical calculation does not lie at zero energy , and its wavefunction does not coincide with the true translational wavefunction , the other ( physical ) states contain some admixture of the ideal spurious state .",
    "these admixtures should be eliminated .",
    "various procedures have been proposed , depending on the specific rpa implementation . in the case of coordinate - space rpa",
    "the basic question is how to remove spurious admixtures from the strength function associated with a given operator @xmath1 acting in the 1@xmath2 channel , namely from @xmath3 where we suppose that @xmath4 are the rpa states having respectively energy @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the nuclear ground - state .",
    "we assume that the definition can be formally extended to the continuum case , when the spectrum is not discrete .",
    "sometimes one is willing to remove the spurious admixtures directly from the transition densities , that are defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density operator .",
    "once more , this definition holds if the spectrum is continuum and the transition density is associated with a state at every positive energy @xmath9 : we will use the notation @xmath10 in what follows .",
    "these two problems have been dealt with extensively in the literature ( see refs .",
    "the solutions include projection methods , use of corrected effective operators etc . however , the present work is motivated by the use of the dipole rpa spectrum not by itself , but as an input to particle - vibration coupling ( pvc ) calculations @xcite . in pvc calculations performed in coordinate space with proper continuum coupling",
    "@xcite the full rpa response function enters ; consequently , one must deal with the subtraction of spurious contamination from that quantity .",
    "since this has not been discussed in the literature previously , to our best knowledge , we discuss the problem in the present paper .",
    "the next section deals with the theoretical formalism .",
    "as recalled in the introduction , the spurious dipole mode is originated by the restoration of the translational symmetry in rpa .",
    "translations along one direction , say the @xmath11-axis , are generated by the total momentum operator @xmath12 which is a conserved quantity , i.e. , @xmath13=0 $ ] .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the ideal spurious state must have @xmath14 and @xmath15 amplitudes associated with the p - h matrix elements of @xmath12 . because of the symmetry of the rpa matrix , its non - zero eigenvalues and eigenvectors appear in pairs .",
    "the partner of the spurious state has amplitudes related to the matrix element of the operator @xmath16 that satisfies @xmath17 = \\frac{-i\\hbar}{am}\\hat p$ ] .",
    "this latter equation is associated with the galilean invariance as it is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we show a method which removes the spurious contribution from the rpa response function in coordinate space representation .",
    "we express the formulas that have been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in coordinate space representation , and extend them to case of the rpa response function .",
    "in order to remove spurious admixtures , first of all , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we suppose the validity of @xmath18 together with the orthogonality conditions @xmath19 = [ \\delta\\hat{\\tilde{\\rho}}(\\omega),\\delta\\hat{\\rho}_q]=0 $ ] , for the `` physical '' transition density operator @xmath20 in its second - quantized form .",
    "@xmath21 is the second - quantized form of the rpa transition density operator .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are related with @xmath24 and @xmath25 by @xmath26 the canonicity conditions @xmath27=-[\\hat q,\\hat p]=-i\\hbar a$ ] hold .",

    "in this paper , we extend the above method to single out `` physical '' quantities labelled by a tilde , to the case of the response function instead of the transition density .",
    "we adopt here the same notation as in ref .",
    "the response function @xmath42 depends on two indices @xmath43 and @xmath44 that identify the operators as in eq .",
    "( [ densop ] ) .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can write @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the external operator . in the previous formula",
    "the superscript 1 refers to the identity operator and the superscript @xmath47 to the operator @xmath48 .",
    "we can use eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ resp1 ] ) ; then , for the response function we can arrive at @xmath49 this is our main result .",
    "it allows extracting the `` physical '' response function @xmath50 from the rpa result @xmath51 .    in the next section ,",
    "we illustrate our method by means of some numerical results for the strength function @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , by using the `` physical '' response function defined in eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) , the `` physical '' strength function can be written as @xmath53 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & s(\\omega ) - \\delta s(\\omega ) ,   \\label{strength}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the strength function defined by the rpa without corrections and @xmath55 is the spurious contribution .    as mentioned in the introduction , the main point of correcting the response function instead of the transition densities or transition strength is that the response function is an input for more sophisticated many - body frameworks like the particle - vibration coupling approach . in this case , the static hf potential is generalized to a time - dependent ( or energy - dependent ) self - energy function .",
    "this self - energy function @xmath56 is associated with the coupling of single - nucleon states with rpa vibrations ; consequently , it can be defined in terms of the hf green s function @xmath57 and the rpa response function .",
    "this definition can be found in the references mentioned in the introduction .",
    "however , we have recently tried for the first time @xcite to formulate this theory in coordinate space . in this case , in order to remove the contribution of the spurious state by using eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) , the self - energy function must be expressed as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the residual ( p - h ) interaction .",
    "using this self - energy function , we can solve the dyson equation @xmath60 in coordinate space , and then obtain the perturbed green s function .",
    "the detail of the formulas will be in our forthcoming paper @xcite , where also several results are discussed . in the present work",
    ", we present some few results about the relevance of projecting out the spurious contribution .",
    "in this section , we study the strength functions both in the case of the electric dipole and the isoscalar compression operators . for this study ,",
    "the nucleus of choice is @xmath61pb .",
    "the equations are solved in a radial mesh that extends up to 20 fm .",
    "the radial step is 0.2 fm .",
    "the states up to angular momentum @xmath62=12 are included in the model space .",
    "the skyrme set employed is sly5 @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the continuum rpa is exactly as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "also we apply our method to hartree - fock plus particle - vibration coupling . as an example , we show the level density in the case of @xmath63o .",
    "we included the rpa electric dipole phonons up to 60 mev .",
    "we discuss the spurious state contribution to the level density , extracted from the green s function which is solution of the dyson equation ( in the level density we adopt a smoothing parameter equal to 0.4 mev ) .      in fig .",
    "[ fige1 ] , we display the strength functions ( and the associated energy - weighted sum rules , ewsrs ) obtained by using the following e1 operators : @xmath64 and @xmath65 the operator defined by eq .",
    "( [ e1op2 ] ) is obtained by removing the center of mass from the original operator of eq .",
    "( [ e1op1 ] ) .",
    "we apply our method to obtain @xmath66 , by leaving the operator equal to ( [ e1op1 ] ) , and we obtain the blue curve in fig .",
    "[ fige1 ] .",
    "one can compare this result to the e1 spectrum without the spurious subtraction ( red curve ) , and to the one obtained by using the original rpa response and the operator ( [ e1op2 ] ) ( green curve ) .",
    "in the lower panel of the figure we show the running , or cumulated , values of ewsrs . from both panels",
    "one can argue that our method succeeds to remove the spurious state .",
    "in particular , the success of our microscopic implementation is very clear from the detailed strength of the upper panel , as no strength remains in the low - energy region down to zero .",
    "similar accurate results can be obtained if the is dipole compression operator is applied .",
    "this operator reads @xmath67 without any center - or - mass subtraction .",
    "many authors have used , to take care of this subtraction , the hydrodynamical ansatz that has been originally proposed in ref .",
    "this amounts to using the operator @xmath68 the factor @xmath69 being often denoted with the symbol @xmath70 .",
    "we present our results in a form which is analogous to the one of the previous subsection in fig .",
    "[ figcl1 ] .",
    "the blue line corresponds to the choice of the bare operator ( [ cl1op1 ] ) , and to the miscroscopic subtraction of the center - of - mass motion proposed in our present work . the associated result can be compared with the use of the operator ( [ cl1op2 ] ) in connection with the original rpa response ( green curve ) and to the rpa result without any subtraction of the center - of - mass either in the operator or in the response function ( red curve ) .",
    "the result of the red curve includes the spurious contributions .",
    "both other curves provide a way to remove these contributions .",
    "although similar , they are not identical : in this respect , the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ figcl1 ] shows to which extent the ansatz ( [ cl1op2 ] ) for the effective operator is accurate .",
    "the small differences are not visible if one looks only at the cumulated ewsrs : both the blue and green line converge to the same result .",
    ".values of the energy - weighted sum rule for the e1 and the isoscalar compression dipole excitations in @xmath61pb with sly5 .",
    "these values correspond to the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fige1 ] and [ figcl1 ] .",
    "@xmath71 is the contribution arising from the center - of - mass spurious motion .",
    "definition are given in the appendix : in particular @xmath72 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the level density @xmath73 can be defined as @xmath74 where @xmath75 can be either the hartree - fock green s function or the perturbed green s function which is obtained by solving the dyson equation .",
    "the spurious state may affect the self - energy function that appears in the dyson equation because the definition includes the rpa response function .",
    "therefore , the spurious contribution should be systematically eliminated from the response function .    in the neutron - rich nuclei like @xmath63o ,",
    "low - lying e1 strength can be larger than in other systems , and the spurious state is not well separated from the other physical states , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fige1o24 ] .    in fig.[lvdo24 ]",
    ", the level density is plotted as a function of the single particle energy .",
    "the dotted black curve is the hartree - fock level density .",
    "the solid red curve is the hf+pvc level density , in which the spurious contribution is properly removed .",
    "the dashed blue curve is the hf+pvc level density , but when the spurious state is not removed .",
    "we have studied neutron level densities , and in particular the upper pannel is the level density in the @xmath76 case , and the lower pannel is the @xmath77 case . by comparing the solid red curve and the dashed blue curve , we can see that the unphysical contribution of the spurious state can not be ignored .",
    "while rpa provides , in principle , a theoretical framework that restores the symmetries which are broken at the mean field level , approximations that are often made can spoil this feature .",
    "this is particularly true for the case of the translational symmetry .",
    "it has been known for several decades that the self - consistency violations , the cutoff in the model space and/or other limitations of the practical rpa implementations leave the spurious center - of - mass motion at finite instead of zero energy and give associated contaminations of the wavefunctions and physical observables related with the rpa states .",
    "many papers have been devoted to this problem , yet the subject of this work is the removal of spurious contributions from the rpa full response function , within the continuum rpa on top of skyrme hf framework . we have presented a microscopic formalism that is claimed to be able to achieve this removal quite successfully , and we have validated this statement by means of accurate calculations of the e1 and isoscalar compression spectra of @xmath61pb .    the original motivation of this work is the possibility of using the rpa response function for particle - vibration coupling calculations .",
    "indeed we have shown , by using the example of level densities in @xmath63o , that the results of pvc either with or without the proper subtraction of the spurious state can substantially differ .",
    "other many - body scheme or reaction calculations require the use of the response function .",
    "in all these cases , our proposed method can display its usefulness .",
    "in general , we define the energy - weighted sum rule associated with the strength function @xmath54 as @xmath78 consistently with eq .",
    "( [ strength ] ) we define @xmath79 with @xmath80 it is well known that @xmath81 can be calculated analitically by means of the expectation value of the double commutator . in this appendix",
    ", we only summarize the useful results in the case of skyrme interactions .",
    "the @xmath81 with the operator ( [ cl1op1 ] ) is given by @xmath87 also @xmath71 can be derived easily as @xmath88 and therefore @xmath89 on the other hand , the energy - weighted sum rule @xmath81 associated with ( [ cl1op2 ] ) reads @xmath90 once more , eq .",
