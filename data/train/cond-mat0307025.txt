    "<S> sharp magnons carrying a small part of the total scattering weight are observed at low energies , but the dominant continuum scattering which occurs at medium to high energies is essentially unchanged compared to the spin liquid phase . </S>",
    "<S> linear spin - wave theory including one- and two - magnon processes can describe the sharp magnon excitation , but not the dominant continuum scattering , which instead is well described by a parameterized two - spinon cross - section . </S>",
