    "bl lacertae (= 1es  2200 + 420 ; z = 0.069 ) was historically the prototype of the bl lac class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "these objects are characterized by continuum properties similar to those of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( non - thermal optical continuum , high degree of linear polarization , rapid variability at all wavelengths , radio jets with individual components often exhibiting apparent superluminal motion ) , but do usually show only weak emission lines ( with equivalent width in the rest - frame of the host galaxy of @xmath8   ) , if any . in bl  lacertae itself ,",
    "however , h@xmath9 ( and h@xmath10 ) emission lines with equivalent widths in excess of 5    have been detected during a period of several weeks in 1995 @xcite , and in 1997 @xcite .",
    "superluminal motion of @xmath11 up to @xmath12 has been observed in this object @xcite .",
    "bl  lacertae is classified as a low - frequency peaked bl  lac object ( lbl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from an interpolation between the ghz radio spectrum and the ir  optical spectrum",
    ", it can be inferred that its low - frequency spectral component typically peaks at mm to @xmath2 m wavelengths , while the high - frequency component seems to peak in the multi - mev  gev energy range .",
    "bl  lacertae has been studied in detail during various intensive multiwavelength campaigns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is a particularly interesting object for detailed x - ray studies since it is in the x - ray regime where the two broad components of the multiwavelength seds of bl  lacertae ( and other lbls ) are overlapping and intersecting .",
    "x - ray observations of this source at different epochs show significant flux and spectral variability , indicating that the x - ray emission is at times dominated by the high - energy end of the synchrotron emission , while at other occasions it is dominated by the low - frequency portion of the high - energy bump of the sed .",
    "in fact , bl  lacertae has repeatedly shown a concave shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , with rapid variability mainly restricted to the low - energy excess portion of the spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    in the framework of relativistic jet models , the low - frequency ( radio  optical / uv ) emission from blazars",
    "is interpreted as synchrotron emission from nonthermal electrons in a relativistic jet . the high - frequency ( x - ray ",
    "@xmath13-ray ) emission could either be produced via compton upscattering of low frequency radiation by the same electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission ( leptonic jet models ; for a recent review see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or due to hadronic processes initiated by relativistic protons co - accelerated with the electrons ( hadronic models , for a recent discussion see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of knowledge of the primary jet launching mechanism and the difficulty in constraining the jet composition from general energetics considerations ( for recent discussions see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are currently leaving both leptonic and hadronic models open as viable possibilities .",
    "also , detailed simulations of particle acceleration at relativistic shocks or shear layers , which may be relevant for the acceleration of ultrarelativistic particles in blazar jets , show that a wide variety of particle injection spectra may result in such scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , greatly differing from the standard spectral index of 2.2  2.3 , which was previously believed to be a universal value in relativistic shock acceleration scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , both the nature of the matter in blazar jets and the energy spectra of ultrarelativistic particles injected into the emission regions in blazar jets are difficult to constrain from first principles .",
    "for this reason , we are leaving these aspects as virtually free parameters in our models , and attempt to constrain them through the results of detailed time - dependent modeling of blazar emission .",
    "while simultaneous broadband spectra are very useful to constrain both types of blazar jet models , there still remain severe ambiguities in their interpretation w.r.t .",
    "the dominant electron cooling , injection , and acceleration mechanisms , as was recently illustrated for the case of w  comae by @xcite .",
    "those authors have also demonstrated that a combination of broadband spectra with timing and spectral variability information , in tandem with time - dependent model simulations @xcite can help to break some of these degeneracies .",
    "for this reason , we had organized an intensive multiwavelength campaign to monitor bl  lacertae in the second half of 2000 at radio , optical , x - ray , and very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath13-ray frequencies , putting special emphasis on detailed variability information .",
    "the results of this multiwavelength campaign were published in @xcite ; for more details on the optical and x - ray observations , see also @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in  [ observations ] , we briefly highlight the main results of that campaign , emphasizing those aspects that we will specifically use here to constrain our model calculations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to use both leptonic and hadronic jet models to fit the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and spectral variability of bl  lacertae observed in 2000 . following a brief description of both leptonic and hadronic models in  [ model_descriptions ] , we will first present spectral fits to the seds of bl  lac in  [ sed_modeling ] .",
    "our code used to evaluate leptonic models allows us to make detailed simulations of the spectral variability resulting from different plausible flaring scenarios . in  [ var_modeling ] , we will first do a general parameter study of various scenarios and compare the results qualitatively with the observed spectral variability trends in bl  lacertae (  [ parameter_study ] ) .",
    "this will allow us to decide on a preferable flaring scenario , for which we subsequently optimize our choice of model parameters to fit simultaneously the sed and spectral variability of bl  lacertae as observed in 2000 (  [ var_fit ] ) .",

    "bl  lacertae was observed in a co - ordinated multiwavelength campaign at radio , optical , x - ray , and vhe @xmath13-ray energies during the period mid - may 2000 , until the end of the year .",

    "have been published in @xcite .",
    "bl  lacertae was in a rather quiescent state during the core campaign , in which the densest light curve sampling was obtained .",
    "however , the source underwent a state transition to an extended high state in mid - september 2000 , which lasted throughout the rest of the year .",
    "the webt campaign returned optical ( r - band ) light curves of unprecedented time coverage and resolution .",
    "brightness variations of @xmath20 , corresponding to flux variations of @xmath21 , within @xmath0  hr have been found .",
    "clear evidence for spectral variability at optical wavelengths was found , and the color changes were more sensitive to rapid variations than the long - term flux level . during well - sampled , short flares ( on time scales of a few hours ) , the color changes strictly follow the flux variability in the sense that the spectra are harder when the flux is higher . a plot of b - r vs. r ( see fig .",
    "[ b_r_fit ] ) reveals two separate regimes within which the r magnitudes are well correlated with the respective b - r colors",
    ". however , there seems to be a discontinuity at @xmath22  mag , separating a high - flux and a low - flux regime . within each regime , a similar range of b - r colors",
    "is observed @xcite .    at x - ray energies ,",
    "bl  lacertae was observed with the _ bepposax _ narrow field instruments ( nfi ) in two pointings on july 26  27 and oct .",
    "31  nov . 2 , 2000 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the source was monitored by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ proportional counter array ( pca ) in 3 short pointings per week @xcite .",
    "the details of the _ bepposax _ observations and the data analysis methods have been published in @xcite .",
    "the drastic change of the activity state of bl  lacertae in mid - september observed in the optical range is accompanied by several large flares in the pca light curve over a @xmath4  months period , but not by a similarly extended high flux state as seen in the optical .",
    "in fact , while the average flux level increased only slightly , a higher level of activity was indicated by a higher degree of variability .    during our second _ bepposax _ pointing around nov . 1 , 2000 , bl  lacertae was in an exceptionally bright x - ray outburst state .",
    "interestingly , the r - band lightcurve indicates a relatively low optical flux , compared to the average flux level after mid - september 2000 , coincident with this x - ray outburst .    in the following , we will concentrate on the data analysis results obtained using a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath23  @xmath24 and an optical extinction coefficient of @xmath25 . during the july 26  27 _ bepposax _ observation ,",
    "the source was in a low flux and activity state .",
    "the fit to the _ bepposax _ spectrum resulted in @xmath26 , confirming the low - activity state of the source at that time and indicating that the entire x - ray spectrum might have been dominated by the low - frequency end of the high - energy component of the broadband sed of bl  lacertae .",
    "the short - term lecs ( [ 0.5  2 ]  kev ) and mecs ( [ 2  10 ]  kev ) lightcurves of bl  lacertae during this observation ( see fig . 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) display a large ( factor @xmath27 ) flare on a time scale of @xmath28  hr , while the source appears less variable at higher energies .",
    "this behavior has been noted in this source before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the lecs + mecs 0.3  10  kev spectrum was well fitted with a power - law model with @xmath29 @xcite . in this observation ,",
    "bl  lacertae was also significantly detected by the pds up to @xmath30  kev , indicating a spectral hardening in this energy range .",
    "the soft shape of the lecs + mecs spectrum clearly indicates that it was dominated by the high - energy end of the low - energy ( synchrotron ) component in this observation .",
    "the spectral hardening evident in the pds spectrum might indicate the onset of the high - energy component beyond @xmath1  kev .",
    "@xcite extracted the lecs and mecs light curves in three different energy channels during the second _ bepposax _ pointing , along with the two hardness ratios : hr1 = mecs [ 2 - 4 ] / lecs [ 0.5 - 2 ] and hr2 = mecs [ 4 - 10 ] / mecs [ 2 - 4 ] .",
    "the lecs and mecs light curves show significant variability in all energy channels , with flux variations of factors of @xmath31  4 on time scales down to @xmath32 ",
    "2  hr .",
    "the x - ray spectral variability on short ( intra - day ) time scales can be characterized through variations of the _ bepposax _ hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 as a function of the respective count rates .",

    "a weak hardness - intensity anti - correlation at soft x - rays ( hr1 vs. lecs ) is generally found . occasionally , a positive hardness - intensity correlation at medium - energy x - rays ( hr2 vs. mecs ) can be found , but is not always apparent .",
    "generally , no significant cross - correlations with measurable time delays between different energy bands could be identified in this campaign .",
    "a possible correlation between the x - ray and optical light curves with an optical delay of 4  5  hr during the july 26  27 _ bepposax _ observation did not hold up to any statistical significance test ( for more details , see * ? ? ?",
    "however , if we assume that the optical lag of @xmath28  5  hr is real and can be interpreted as due to synchrotron cooling , it allows an independent magnetic field estimate , which is in good agreement with the independent estimate based on the measured synchrotron peak flux and a basic equipartition argument ( see  [ parameter_estimates ] ) .",

    "radiation mechanisms included in our simulations are synchrotron emission , compton upscattering of synchrotron photons ( ssc = synchrotron self compton scattering ; * ? ? ?",

    "while leptonic models deal with a relativistic e@xmath52 plasma in the jet , in hadronic models the relativistic jet consists of a relativistic proton ( @xmath53 ) and electron ( @xmath54 ) component .",
    "here we use the hadronic synchrotron - proton blazar ( spb- ) model of @xcite to model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of bl lacaerte in july and november 2000 .    like in the leptonic model , the emission region , or `` blob '' , in an agn jet moves relativistically along the jet axis which is closely aligned with our line - of - sight .",
    "relativistic ( accelerated ) protons , whose particle density @xmath55 follows a power law spectrum @xmath56 in the range @xmath57 , are injected instantaneously into a highly magnetized environment ( @xmath58  const . within the emission region ) , and are subject to energy losses due to proton - photon interactions ( meson production and bethe - heitler pair production ) , synchrotron radiation and adiabatic expansion .",
    "the mesons produced in photonmeson interactions always decay in astrophysical environments .",

    "the spb - model is designed for objects with a negligible external target photon component , and hence suitable for bl  lac objects .",
    "the cascade redistributes the photon power to lower energies where the photons eventually escape from the emission region .",
    "the cascades can be initiated by photons from @xmath62-decay ( `` @xmath62 cascade '' ) , electrons from the @xmath63 decay ( `` @xmath64 cascade '' ) , @xmath53-synchrotron photons ( `` @xmath53-synchrotron cascade '' ) , charged @xmath2- , @xmath65- and @xmath66-synchrotron photons ( `` @xmath67-synchrotron cascade '' ) and @xmath68 from proton - photon bethe - heitler pair production ( `` bethe - heitler cascade '' ) .",
    "because `` @xmath62 cascades '' and `` @xmath64 cascades '' generate rather featureless photon spectra @xcite , proton and muon synchrotron radiation and their reprocessed radiation turn out to be mainly responsible for the high energy photon output in blazars .",
    "the contribution from the bethe - heitler cascades is mostly negligible .",
    "the low energy component is dominanted by synchrotron radiation from the primary @xmath54 , with a small contribution of synchrotron radiation from secondary electrons ( produced by the @xmath53- and @xmath67-synchrotron cascade ) . a detailed description of the model itself , and",

    "5  hr was found not to be statistically significant , it is interesting to investigate which magnetic field could be derived if such a correlation was indeed real and the delay was caused by synchrotron cooling of high - energy electrons .",
    "this has been done in @xcite , resulting in    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the ratio of the external - photon - field energy density to the magnetic - field energy density in the co - moving frame .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , eq . [ b_rx ] may , in fact , slightly overestimate the actual magnetic field since at least the optical synchrotron emitting electrons may also be affected by adiabatic losses and escape .",
    "depending on the details ( geometry and mechanism ) of the jet collimation , those processes can act on time scales as short as the dynamical time scale , which is constrained by the observed minimum variability time scale of @xmath82  hr ( in the observer s frame ) .",
    "another note of caution that needs to be kept in mind is that the rather large sampling time scale of the x - ray light curve of @xmath83  hr , precludes the estimation of magnetic fields larger than @xmath84  g from delays between the optical and x - ray light curves .",
    "it is remarkable that the two magnetic - field estimates are in good agreement if the doppler factor is slightly larger than 10 and/or the parameter @xmath85 is only slightly less than 1 .",
    "we thus conclude that a magnetic field of @xmath86  g might be a realistic value for bl  lacertae .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the magnetic - field estimate of 1.5  2  g for leptonic models , the approximate location of the synchrotron peak of the seds of bl  lacertae at @xmath87  hz allows us to estimate that the electron energy distribution in the synchrotron emitting region should peak at @xmath88 , also in reasonable agreement with earlier estimates for this source @xcite .",
    "the location of the synchrotron cutoff in the quiescent state at @xmath89  hz then yields a maximum electron energy in the quiescent state of @xmath90 , while the synchrotron cutoff in the flaring state at @xmath91  hz yields @xmath92 . for hadronic models ,",
    "the magnetic - field estimate is a factor of @xmath93 higher than in the leptonic case .",
    "consequently , the estimates for the co - moving energies of the synchrotron - emitting electrons will be lower by a factor of @xmath94 .    the superluminal - motion measurements place a lower limit on the bulk lorentz factor @xmath95 , and we expect that the doppler boosting factor @xmath96 is of the same order . since , unfortunately , we only have an upper limit on the vhe @xmath13-ray flux during the campaign of 2000 , and no measurements in the mev  gev regime , no independent estimate from @xmath51 opacity constraints can be derived .",
    "however , such an estimate was possible for the july 1997 @xmath13-ray outburst and yielded @xmath97 @xcite , which is a much weaker constraint than derived from the superluminal motion observations .    from the optical and x - ray variability time scale",

    "the main results of our modelling work are :    * both leptonic and hadronic models are able to provide acceptable fits to the seds of bl  lacertae in 2000 , both in the low activity state on july 26/27 and in the high activity state on oct .",
    "in addition to the naturally much higher overall jet power required for hadronic models ( @xmath181  ergs  s@xmath19 vs. @xmath182  ergs  s@xmath19 [ depending on the possible poynting - flux contribution ] ) , the hadronic spb model requires a factor of @xmath93 higher magnetic fields ( @xmath183  40  g vs. @xmath4  g ) and a significantly lower bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath184  9 vs. @xmath185 ) . * considering time - averaged emission during the two intensity states , hadronic models predict a sustained level of multi - gev  tev emission which should be detectable with second - generation atmospheric cherenkov telescope systems like veritas , hess , or magic .",
    "in contrast , our leptonic model only predicts a peak flux exceeding the anticipated nominal magic sensitivity during short flares ; the accumulated fluence over observing time scales of several hours might not be sufficient for a significant detection .",
    "thus , a future vhe detection of bl  lacertae would be a strong indication for hadronic processes being at work in this object . * a parameter study of various spectral variability scenarios in the framework of our leptonic jet model revealed that the observed optical and x - ray spectral variability in bl  lacertae in 2000 can be reproduced through short - term fluctuations of only the electron injection spectral index , with all other parameters remaining unchanged .",
    "our simulation of this scenario predicts counter - clockwise spectral hysteresis at x - ray energies .",
    "such hysteresis was not predicted in the specific spb model fits presented in this paper , but could not clearly be ruled out either .",
    "thus , sensitive spectral - hysteresis measurements of bl  lacertae could possibly serve as a test of our modeling results and a secondary diagnostic to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic models , though , by itself , it would not be sufficient as a model discriminant . *",
    "the previously noted discrepancy between the time - averaged optical and x - ray spectra may be resolved by considering the spectral variability .",
    "our successful modeling of the observed time - dependent flux and hardness values at optical and x - ray frequencies in the framework of a leptonic model effectively removes the need for additional assumptions concerning additional particle populations , extreme klein - nishina effects on the electron cooling rates , and/or anomalies in the intergalactic absorption .",
    "we thank m. ravasio for sending us the bepposax effective area curves used in the data analysis of the bl  lac 2000 campaign , and the anonymous referee for a constructive report which has definitely helped to improve the clarity of the manuscript .",

    "<S> bl  lacertae was observed in two different activity states : a quiescent state with relatively low levels of optical and x - ray fluxes and a synchrotron cutoff at energies below the x - ray regime , and a flaring state with high levels of optical and x - ray emission and a synchrotron cutoff around or even beyond @xmath1  kev . in this paper , we are using both leptonic and hadronic jet models to fit the broadband spectra and spectral variability patterns observed in both activity states in 2000 . </S>",
    "<S> we start out with global spectral models of both activity states . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we investigate various flaring scenarios for comparison with the observed short - term variability of bl lacertae in 2000 . for our leptonic jet model , we find that the short - term variability , in particular the optical and x - ray spectral variability , can be best represented with a flaring scenario dominated by a spectral - index change of the spectrum of ultrarelativistic electrons injected into the jet . </S>",
