    "the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ) survey ( go 9978 , s. beckwith , pi ) is the deepest view of the universe in the optical and near infrared obtained to date .",
    "imaging was acquired with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) at a position located within the great observatories origins deep survey  ( goods , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) south field , centered at r.  a.  ( j2000)=03h32m3900 and decl .",
    "( j2000)=-274729.1 .",
    "a total of 400 _ hst _ orbits were accumulated to achieve a @xmath3 detection threshold of approximately 29 mag ( vega ) in the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6-bands , and approximately 28 mag in the @xmath7-band . to further enhance the vast array of deep multi - wavelength imaging for this region , deep near infrared images",
    "were also obtained in the udf target field ( irudf ; go 9803 , r. thompson , pi ) by acquiring individual pointings with the near infrared camera and multi object spectrometer ( nicmos ) camera 3 , each 8 orbits in depth in both the @xmath8 and @xmath9-bands , to cover a 3 x 3 mosaic near the center of the udf .",
    "this observation was divided into two epochs separated by 90 days to enable searches for sne .",
    "another extremely deep optical field , an acs `` parallel field '' , observed during the imaging of the irudf , overlapped with goods south observations .",
    "the udf , the udf acs parallel ( udfp ) , and the irudf surveys are unique in that they are the first surveys sensitive to type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) to @xmath10 .",
    "with an elasped time of less than 4 gyr between the first generation of stars ( @xmath11 ) and sne ia at @xmath1 , the observed number of these events at @xmath12 could provide an important probe of the assembly time required by sne ia progenitors  ( * ? ? ? * hereafter s04 ) .",
    "the rate in which sn ia events occur is governed by the rate in which their progenitor stars form , and the time required for the sn ia progenitor to develop into a sn ia event . in the framework of cosmic time , these components are the star formation rate history , and the population assembly time , or the delay time function  ( * ? ? ?",
    "together , the star formation rate history and the delay time function describe a model for the sn ia rate history [ @xmath13 , which can be compared to observations of the sn ia rate in different redshift regimes .    in principle",
    ", the observed discovery rate of sne at @xmath2 could help to distinguish between viable models of @xmath14 . in s04",
    ", it was shown that observations of the sn ia rate over a large redshift range ( encompassing the most of the last @xmath15 billion years of the universe ) are consistent with the combination of the star formation rate history from rest - frame @xmath16-band galaxy studies [ hereafter sfr@xmath17(@xmath18 ) , see  @xcite ] , and a gaussian distribution of delay times , with a mean @xmath19 gyr and a dispersion of @xmath20 gyr .",
    "however , recently it has been shown that the rate sne  ia per galaxy at @xmath21 does appear to increase towards later galaxy types , e.  g.  the sn ia rate in irregular ( dwarf ) galaxies is approximately 10 times larger than in elliptical galaxies of the same total mass  @xcite .",
    "this would seem to imply that the sn ia rate more closely traces the star formation rate history rather than being largely delayed from it .",
    "this is difficult to resolve in light of the goods supernova data .",
    "however , one could hypothesize that the rest - frame @xmath16-band galaxy observations ( including dust corrections ) , in reality , provide a rather poor tracer of actual star formation history , or only a lower limit  @xcite . or , perhaps the completeness thresholds for the goods sn survey , the sensitivity as a function of change in flux , were significantly overestimated .    a simple test of the s04 model would be to push the limits of survey sensitivity well beyond those achieved in the goods survey , and continue to look for high redshift sne ia at @xmath1 .",
    "one can then compare observed yields to those expected in this redshift regime from the s04 and other viable models of the sn  ia rate history . if @xmath14 is indeed delayed by @xmath19 gyr from the sfr@xmath17(@xmath18 )",
    ", then it is expected that the rate at @xmath22 will be very low , and thus essentially no ( @xmath23 ) sne  ia in this range could be found in this deep survey . even if the @xmath14 is closely tied to the sfr@xmath17(@xmath18 ) , i.  e.  with mean delays of less than approximately one billion years from star formation , then there could be on the order of only one sn  ia discovery at @xmath22 . however , a very meaningful test this survey could provide is if the @xmath14 greatly increases with redshift , as it would if it were tied to the sfr@xmath24(@xmath18 ) , where one could expect at least few sne  ia at @xmath1 in this deep field survey .",
    "we have searched spans of images of the udf , udfp , and irudf observations for high redshift sne and have found a total of four events , none of which were at @xmath2 . in ",
    "2 we describe the udf+udfp and irudf searches , show discovery and subsequent photometric data for the events found in the optical data , and present the evidence which show the relatively low redshift of these events . in ",
    "3 we compare the observed low observed yield at @xmath22 to that which would be predicted from a few sn rate models .",
    "the udf and udfp images were searched by differencing stacks of images in the @xmath7-band , assembled as they were collected over the duration of the deep survey .",
    "a total of nine multi - orbit epoch image stacks were created for the udf field , and two were made for the udfp .",
    "the first stack for each field was differenced with an overlapping area in either the acs goods mosaic in the case of the udf , or with acs images obtained for go  9352 ( a. riess , pi ) in the case of the udfp .",
    "the subsequent stacks in both surveys were differenced with their preceding stacks .",
    "similarly , the irudf images were searched by differencing two epochs of mosaic images , each 4 orbits in depth , in both the @xmath8 and @xmath9 passbands .",
    "the two mosaic image stacks of the irudf were separated by approximately 77 days . in each the udf ,",
    "udfp , and irudf searches , image stacks were produced using _",
    "multidrizzle _  @xcite by using the median of several exposures .",
    "this successfully rejects cosmic rays without rejecting transients which last substantially longer than the length of one exposure ( @xmath25 seconds ) .",
    "the udf and udfp were drizzled to @xmath26 per pixel in these preliminary image stacks , and later re - drizzled to @xmath27 per pixel for the final release of the full - depth images .",
    "the irudf was drizzled to @xmath28 per pixel , chosen to be a multiple of the final udf pixel scale .",
    "subtracted images were mined for candidate sne by automated computer searches and close visual inspection of the images .",
    "the criteria for identifying potential sne , and for rejecting possible confusion sources , were very similar to those used in s04 .",
    "each image stack of the udf and udfp would be sensitive to motions only larger than the point spread function ( @xmath29 fwhm in @xmath7 ) over the accumulation time of the image stack ( roughly one week ) .",
    "the proper motion of any candidate would have to be less than @xmath30 arcseconds hr@xmath31 ( @xmath32 degrees yr@xmath31 ) to be misidentified .",
    "this would exclude any foreground solar system object , as it would need to be farther than @xmath33 au if orbiting the sun at @xmath34 km s@xmath31 , which is well beyond the current estimates of the extent of the solar system .",
    "slow - moving galactic stars could also be generally excluded on similar hypothetical grounds .",
    "variable stars are also easily excluded by their nature of being stars in all epochs of observation , and by generally appearing unassociated with galaxies in the field .",
    "variable stars that , on occasion , do appear aligned with field galaxies are typically several orders of magnitude brighter than one would expect for sne in these galaxies .",
    "what remained in the subtracted images are true extragalactic transients ( e.  g.  supernovae and active galactic nuclei ) and image artifacts such as misregistrations and variations in the point spread function .",
    "as the field is fairly dense with galaxies , and well resolved in the acs images , there were no significant local misregistrations in the udf and udfp , except for stellar diffraction spikes which rolled with the change in orientation between epochs of the surveys .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) in each median combined image stack was largely stable and unaffected by short - term , exposure - to - exposure changes in the psf ( e.  g.  telescope breathing or focus drift ) .",
    "thus , we are confident that we have identified only extragalactic transients from the udf and udfp subtraction images .    variable active galactic nuclei ( agn ) were defined as candidates that were within one pixel of their host nuclei .",
    "this is a rather conservative definition , as in principle , we would be capable of identifying transients with centroids a fraction of a pixel offset from the centroid of light in the nucleus of a galaxy .",
    "however , there were no detected candidates ( down to the 5@xmath35 threshold ) that were @xmath36 from the centroid of the host galaxy the udf and udfp searches .",
    "other investigations which probe for much smaller optical variations ( 1 to 3@xmath35 ) in galaxy nuclei do show evidence for low - level agn in the udf target field ( windhorst et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , none of which would be undeniably identified with our differencing method .    the nicmos images , however , suffered from intrapixel sensitivity effects .",
    "camera 3 is poorly sampled at @xmath37 per pixel , and can produce as much as a 30% flux variation depending if the peak of a psf is centered on a given pixel , or is offset towards the edges of the pixel  @xcite .",
    "this flux variation in the pixel response function ( prf ) is not removed in the flat - field correction , and imposes an inherent limitation in these images . with many dithered exposures of the same field ,",
    "it is possible to map the prf  @xcite , and determine a correction to psf photometry . unfortunately , there are no easy means to deconvolve the prf from the psf . therefore , differencing the two image stacks of the irudf necessarily resulted in a `` checkerboard '' pattern of under and over subtractions ( measured at about @xmath38 ) .",
    "faint and diffuse objects were generally cleanly subtracted .    in tables  [ tab : tab3 ] and  [ tab : tab4 ] we list the epoch stacks created for the udf , udfp , and irudf searches , with the mean date of the image stack , the total number of orbits , and the total exposure time of each stack . to asses the sensitivity and completeness of the udf , udfp , and irudf searches , we performed monte carlo tests with planted psfs meant to represent false sne .    in the case of the irudf ,",
    "a psf was generated from a few stars in the images , and scaled to one count per second using zero points and aperture corrections provided by the nicmos group at space telescope science institute .",
    "the measured aperture photometry was then corrected for intrapixel sensitivity variations following a prescription detailed in  @xcite .",
    "we placed one false sn of a given magnitude on the centers of a randomly selected set of 50 detected objects ( to @xmath39 ) , subtracted the images , and then attempted to recover the false sne by visual inspection ( without prior knowledge of the locations of each planted false sn ) .",
    "this method was iterated to successively fainter magnitudes ( in steps of 0.2 mag ) until none of the planted sne were recovered .",
    "the resulting histograms of percent recovered per magnitude bin is shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the sensitivity in each epoch of the irudf was determined from the difference magnitude , @xmath40 , determined from the flux difference of objects in the residual frame , which is given by :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the flux of the false sn in first and second image stacks , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the corresponding magnitudes , and @xmath46 is the photometric zero point ( total flux of 1 count per second ) .",
    "we use an analytical function to describe the efficiency in detecting objects of a given difference magnitude :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the maximum efficiency , @xmath49 represents a cutoff magnitude where @xmath50 drops below 50% of @xmath48 , and @xmath51 controls the shape of the roll - off .",
    "we find that @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 well describes the efficiency histogram for the @xmath8 passband , and @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 parameterizes the efficiency in the @xmath9 passband ( see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] )",
    ".    in the @xmath7 passband of the udf and udfp surveys , false star tests show nearly identical efficiency function parameters as those used in s04 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , however with adjusted @xmath60 efficiency cutoff magnitudes ( @xmath61 ) corresponding to the @xmath62 sensitivity limits for the difference of a given pair of stacks ( also shown in tables  [ tab : tab3 ] and  [ tab : tab4 ] ) .",
    "these limits are in good agreement with those expected from the exposure times of the search and template images using the acs exposure time calculators .",
    "the typical brightness threshold of detection for the @xmath7 template - search pairs was @xmath63 mag .",
    "an illustration of the sensitivity threshold can be seen in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] where we have added six fake sne ( psfs ) at @xmath64 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 27.5 , and 28 mag in a region of the 1224 - 1230 image stack . by differencing it with the 1212 - 1218 image stack , we can clearly detect the sources to a flux level of 27 mag , but fainter than 27 mag was difficult to identify without prior knowledge of where the fake sne were .",
    "this is in good agreement with the estimated detection threshold ( from the exposure times ) of 27.1 mag for this template - search pair .",
    "the detection thresholds are bright enough to detect sne  ia at peak at @xmath65 in each passband .    despite the intrapixel sensitivity limitations of the irduf survey ,",
    "interestingly , no candidate sne were discovered in the deep irudf imaging .",
    "however , four sne were discovered in the udf and udfp images .",
    "for each , vega based aperture magnitudes were measured from difference images in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 bandpasses , using aperture corrections and photometric error estimations described in s04 . in all cases , we used photometric redshifts ( phot-@xmath18 ) determined from the multi - wavelength goods data to estimate the redshifts of the host galaxies  @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation has not been obtained for these sne .",
    "we also generally lack the photometric data and age constraints necessary to assuredly identify the sn types using the identification confidence scheme detailed in s04 and color selection methods described in  @xcite .",
    "however , we can still use these techniques to reject combinations of sn type and redshift space , specifically we can reject the faint and red signature of sne  ia at very high redshifts .",
    "the discovery images for all four sne are shown in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , and the positional and photometric data are listed in tables  [ tab : tab1 ] and  [ tab : tab2 ] .",
    "three sne were identified in the area of the udfp field .",
    "k0302 - 001 ] was discovered in the goods follow - up images from go 9352 , and not detected seven months later ( to within 5@xmath35 ) in the udfp images .",
    "the host of k0302 - 001 was very faint , with @xmath66 mag within a 0.2  radius , and very blue , virtually undetectable at @xmath67 in the same aperture .",
    "the galaxy could not be sufficiently detected in any of the deep multi - wavelength ground - based data sample assembled for the goods ( spanning @xmath16 though @xmath68-bands ) , and was only identified in two acs bands : @xmath5 and @xmath69 .",
    "the lack of photometric measurements of the host galaxy made it difficult to constrain its photometric redshift using the bayesian photometric redshift ( bpz ) method  @xcite .",
    "the phot-@xmath18 estimate derived of the host of k0302 - 001 lacks a significant peak and has a broad 95% confidence interval of @xmath70 .",
    "however , the photometry of the sn is more illuminating .",
    "the magnitude and colors ( specifically the red @xmath71 color of 3.33 mag ; see @xcite  @xcite ) match those of the five sne  ia measured by  @xcite at or near maximum at @xmath72 .",
    "results from  @xcite demonstrate that @xmath73 95% of sne with these photometric characteristics are correctly identified as sne ia ( with the other 5% being sne ic or ib ) .",
    "a firm conclusion we can make is that this sn is too bright and too blue to be a sn ia ( of any previously seen luminosity and color ) at @xmath1 .",
    "sn  2003lt was discovered in the first udfp stack ( mean date 2003 aug .",
    "31 ) , and undetected in the goods follow - up comparison images .",
    "it was also well detected in the second udfp stack of mean date 2003 sep .",
    "the host galaxy was well detected in several passbands , and thus the phot-@xmath18 for the host was well constrained at @xmath74 ( @xmath75 95% confidence interval ) .",
    "we find that the photometry and colors of this sn were consistent with those for a sn  ia discovered @xmath76 days from maximum light at @xmath74 , and inconsistent with tested sn ia scenarios ( varying age , light - curve shape , and extinction ) at @xmath2 .",
    "sn  2003lu was found in the second udfp stack , and not detected in the first udfp stack .",
    "the single @xmath7-band measurement alone does not allow for a restriction in sn type and redshift space .",
    "however , the phot-@xmath18 for the bright and well - detected host was @xmath77 ( 0.0 - 0.25 95% confidence interval ) , and therefore we can reject the possibility that this was a sn  ia at @xmath2 .",
    "the only sn detected in several epochs of the udf target field observations was sn  2004r , discovered in the last 6-orbit stack obtained 2004 jan .",
    "it was not detected , to within 5@xmath35 , in the 12-orbit stack from 2003 dec .",
    "a review of the data obtained 2004 jan .",
    "1 - 11 revealed that the sn was rapidly rising in the @xmath7 and @xmath6-bands , but declining in the @xmath5-band .",
    "the phot-@xmath18 for the host galaxy was again well constrained at @xmath78 ( @xmath79 95% confidence interval ) .",
    "the light curves and colors were generally consistent with our type ii - plateau model , sn  1999em , caught prior to rest - frame @xmath80band maximum light , with a host extinction of @xmath81 mag ( assuming a galactic extinction law ) at the photometric redshift .",
    "the colors and magnitudes of the sn are inconsistent with sn ia models at @xmath2 .    to summarize ,",
    "our searching of the udf , udfp , and irudf resulted in four sne of largely unknown types , but we can reject the possibility than any were sne ia at @xmath2 .",
    "the sample of sne  ia from the goods has shown for the first time a distinct rise in the sn  ia rate from @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "these measurements are statistically inconsistent with a constant ( or nearly constant ) @xmath14 , as inferred from measures of the sn rate at @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "an apparent discrepancy exists in the sn  ia rate measurements at @xmath84 . at this redshift ,",
    "the sn ia rate measured from the goods data are nearly twice as high as measurements made in the ground - based high-@xmath18 supernova search programs  @xcite .",
    "the natural explanation would appear to be that completeness was not a primary goal for these ground - based programs , and was generally sacrificed for sake of favorable sne  ia with low background contamination for optimal spectroscopic confirmation and precise distance measurements .",
    "indeed , a recent , careful re - examination of the data from the fall 1999 campaign of the high-@xmath18 supernova search project  @xcite , and the fall 2001 ifa survey  @xcite shows preliminary evidence of many additional sne resulting an increase by a factor of two in the sn  ia candidates , and thus a likely increase in the rates determined from these data to values consistent with the goods measurements ( brian j. barris and john l. tonry , in private communications ) .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing result on the supernovae rates from the goods sample has been the dearth of sne  ia discovered at @xmath85 .",
    "@xcite have found that there is a steep decline in the rate at @xmath86 in comparison to the rate at @xmath74 , a result seemingly at odds with the lack of such a decline in the global star formation rate in this redshift range .",
    "however , s04 and  @xcite have shown that @xmath14 is a reflection of the sfr@xmath17(@xmath18 ) which has been delayed by the assembly time function ( or delay time function ) , i.  e.  the time for sn  ia progenitors to go from formation to explosion .",
    "s04 find that the difference in the evolution of the sfr@xmath17(@xmath18 ) and the @xmath87 can be well modeled as a gaussian delay time function with a mean delay of @xmath19 gyr and a dispersion that is a small fraction of the delay .",
    "subsequently  @xcite find that based on the model delay , the fraction of stellar mass in the range of 3 to 8 solar masses which will explode as sne ia is about @xmath88 .",
    "past searches for sne ia in high - redshift clusters with hst by  @xcite show rates that are similar to field sn ia rates , indicating some similarity in their rate evolution",
    ". unfortunately , these cluster rate measurement at @xmath89 are not precise enough , nor sufficiently well sampled in redshift space , to definitively compare their sn  ia rate history to those measured in normal ( field ) environments .",
    "an anecdotal anomoly in the consideration of the decline in @xmath14 at @xmath90 is the serendipitous discovery of sn  1997ff , found in only one re - observation of a pointing with _",
    "hst _ and wfpc2",
    "the combined depth of the template - search pair for the sn  1997ff discovery image was only marginally deeper than for a single tile of template - search epoch of the goods .",
    "the sn itself , although likely magnified by 0.3 mag  @xcite , was discovered well above the detection threshold for the tiny survey .",
    "the 5 month durration of the udf+udfp search and the factor of 2 increase in area of acs over wfpc2 suggest that the number of such sne ia at @xmath90 found in the udf should exceed those found by gilliland et al .",
    "( 1999 ) by a factor of @xmath735 .",
    "yet , when dealing with such small , pencil - beam surveys , the survey yields can be subject more to chance than expectations .",
    "the low number of expected sne serve more as a probability for finding sne , governed by poisson statistics .    in the previous section we concluded that our searches of the udf , udfp , and irudf had failed to yield any sne ia at @xmath2 .",
    "to test the significance of this null result , we have simulated the yield expected in the multiple campaigns ( image stacks ) of the survey based on the best - fit @xmath14 determined in s04 . as in s04 ,",
    "the number of expected sne per redshift interval was determined by :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the `` control time '' probability function , which takes into account the survey efficiency with difference magnitude ( described in  2 ) , @xmath93 is the area surveyed , and @xmath94 is the volume element in a @xmath95 shell about @xmath18 for an assumed flat universe ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "this is the correct form of the equation , which has a typographical error in s04 . ] .",
    "the expected number of sne  ia at @xmath2 is then ,    @xmath97    for comparison , we also calculated the yield expected from a @xmath14 which is directly proportional ( i.  e.  without delay ) to the extinction corrected sfr@xmath17(@xmath18 ) model used in s04 , but with an explosion efficiency for the sn  ia progenitor mass range of 10% ( instead of 5% ) as required to match sn  ia rate measurements at @xmath98 by various authors ( see figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) .    as a straw man",
    ", we also computed the yield expected from a @xmath14 which proportional to the sfr@xmath24(@xmath18 ) without any delay where we again assumed the progenitor efficiency to be @xmath99 to match the low-@xmath18 sn  ia rates .",
    "the expected number of sne  ia from the tested models over all redshift ranges and at @xmath1 for each image stack of the udf and udfp ( differenced with the prior image stack ) are tabulated and summed in tables  [ tab : tab3 ] and  [ tab : tab4 ] . in figures",

    "the universe was only 4.5 billion years old at @xmath100 ( assuming @xmath101 km s@xmath31 mpc@xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 ) , and few early forming progenitors would have had sufficient time to explode .",
    "we determined the significance of the yield given the model using the poisson probability for observing a number of events ,    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the integer number of observed sne  ia ( @xmath107 in this survey ) and @xmath108 is the expected number of events determined from the model .",
    "the absence of sn  ia events from this survey in the tested redshift range is an expected result for this best - fit @xmath14 model , with poisson probabilities of 94.2% , 98.2% , and 99.1% assigned to this outcome in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9-bands , respectively .",
    "however , a null result could also be expected from a @xmath14 proprotional to the sfr@xmath17(@xmath18 ) ( i.e. , with no delay ) with poisson probabilities of 50.4% , 81.7% , and 86.7% for zero observed events in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9-bands .",
    "although the greatest expected yield would come from the model proportional to the sfr@xmath24(@xmath18 ) , a null yield could still be expected in the tested redshift range with probabilities of 22.5% , 64.4% , 74.8% in the respective passbands .",
    "it is interesting to consider what the relative agreement with the tested models would have been had a single sn  ia at @xmath1 been discovered in each search .",
    "if one high-@xmath18 sn  ia had been found in each the @xmath8 and @xmath9-bands , then it would have been very unlikely that s04 best - fit @xmath14 represents the true sn  ia rate history , as such an outcome would be expected less than 2% of the time .",

    "there is significant evidence for uncertainty in the estimates of galaxy volume densities for specific populations in the goods fields  @xcite , and the survey presented in this paper covers a smaller area of the goods south field .",
    "however , the sfr@xmath17(@xmath18 ) model ( in the @xmath90 regime ) used in this analysis was also determined from goods data , and therefore should be subject to the same variances .",
    "the sfr@xmath24(@xmath18 ) model , by contrast , was determined from several local surveys , and through theoretical modeling of the evolution of the galaxy infrared luminosity function  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect cosmic variance to distort the predicted sn  ia rate in this observed volume ( from @xmath120 ) when applying the global average sfr@xmath24(@xmath18 ) to this small field .",
    "it should be noted that our lower - bound on the redshift range tested , @xmath2 , was based on the redshift range where the completeness of the udf+udfp survey becomes significant over the goods sn survey .",
    "however , our results are not very sensitive to the precise definition of the uniquely high - redshift space of this survey .",
    "additionally , other baselines and combinations of images in the udf and udfp surveys could have been selected which would have increased the expected number of sne ia in the desired redshift range . however",
    ", an increase by a factor of 5 or more would be necessary to begin to significantly rule out some of the tested models .",
    "tests of varying cadences between visits and combining image stacks result in changes in the expected yield of the tested models of less than a factor of two in the considered redshift range .",
    "it appears that deepest - field - type , pencil beam surveys ( i.e. , the udf or the hubble deep field ) with _ hst _ lack the volume necessary to accumulate a statistically significant sample to differentiate between the current plausible @xmath14 models in the redshift regimes in which they are uniquely sensitive .",
    "this is not surprising , considering that the increased exposure times over the goods did not significantly increase the luminosity distance probed .",
    "it would be necessary to repeat the udf survey several times ( or an increase of several times the survey area ) in order to achieve expected yields for significant poisson probability rejection of the tested models .",
    "this would not be economical with _",
    "hst _ given the enormity of the udf survey .",
    "progress in determining the rates of sne ia and their associated timescales for assembly is most likely to come by `` piggybacking '' such studies on the now numerous and major efforts to find and measure supernovae to constrain dark energy parameters . such `` cosmology - driven '' sn surveys are designed as wide , open field surveys and are well - suited to deriving the supernova field rates .",
    "these surveys generally avoid galaxy clusters as search targets because half of the yield of sne ia found in such surveys are located behind the clusters  @xcite where contamination by lensing is unavoidable .",
    "in addition , potential evolutionary differences between cluster and field - born sne ia could add systematic errors to cosmological determinations . as a result",
    ", very deep rates and cluster rates of sne ia have been studied on a much smaller scale than field rates .",
    "the udf , udfp , and irudf observations yielded four sne over the 5 month duration of the survey .",
    "we find the dearth of sne ia at high redshift in this survey to be consistent with the best - fit @xmath14 from s04 .",
    "however , it is also a likely result from a @xmath14 which follows the sfr@xmath17(@xmath18 ) at a higher progenitor explosion efficiency .",
    "more rapidly increasing @xmath14 , such as the  @xcite sfr@xmath24(@xmath18 ) model without delay , also can not be significantly rejected by these data , because of the relatively small area probed in this survey .",
    "the general conclusion is that these data are well supported by the goods best - fit model , which shows that sne  ia progenitors require substantial ( approximately 4 gyr ) delays from star formation to produce events .",
    "however , other plausible sn  ia rate models can not be excluded .",
    "surveys such as the goods more than compensate for the loss in depth by the increased survey area , and are vastly superior programs for differentiating between sn  ia rate models .",
    "future endeavors with _ hst _ such as the cycle 12 programs by a. riess and s. perlmutter ( pis for gos 9727 and 9728 respectively ) and the _ probing acceleration now with supernovae _ ( or pans , go-10189 , a. riess , pi ) in cycle 13 will allow for much more precise measure of the sn  ia rate in the @xmath90 regime . in combination with the goods data , they will provide the best available measures of the empirical distributions of sn  ia delay times and the comparison to star formation rate models .",
