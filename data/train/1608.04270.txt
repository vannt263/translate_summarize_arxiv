    "the topic of the article , although relatively new , has a straightforward connection to the classical problems of a bicentennial history . as the starting point we may view the celebrated cauchy theorem which claims that a convex polyhedron is uniquely determined from its development .",
    "later , the problems of unique determination of convex surfaces were studied by minkowski , hilbert , weyl , blashke , cohn - vossen , and other prominent mathematicians .",
    "the greatest progress in this direction was achieved by a.  d.  alexandrov and his students .",
    "let us recall pogorelov s celebrated theorem on unique determination of a closed convex surface from its intrinsic metric ( for example , see  @xcite ) .",
    "in  @xcite , we proposed a new approach to the problem of unique determination of surfaces , which allowed to substantially enlarge the framework of the problem .",
    "the following model situation illustrates the essence of this approach fairly well .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be two domains ( i.e. , open connected sets ) in the real @xmath2-dimensional euclidean space @xmath3 whose closures @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , are lipschitz manifolds ( such that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the boundary of @xmath8 in @xmath3 ) .",
    "assume also that the boundaries @xmath9 and @xmath10 of these domains , which coincide with the boundaries of the manifolds @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are isometric with respect to their relative metrics @xmath13 ( @xmath5 ) , i.e. , with respect to the metrics that are the restrictions to the boundaries @xmath14 of the extensions ( by continuity ) of the intrinsic metrics of the domains @xmath15 to @xmath4 .",
    "the following natural question arises : _ under which additional conditions are the domains @xmath0 and @xmath1 themselves isometric ( in the euclidean metric ) _ ?",
    "in particular , the natural character of this problem is determined by the circumstance that the problem of unique determination of closed convex surfaces mentioned in the beginning of the article is its most important particular case .",
    "indeed , assume that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two closed convex surfaces in @xmath18 , i.e. , they are the boundaries of two bounded convex domains @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the complement of the closure @xmath22 of the domain @xmath23 , @xmath5 .",
    "then the intrinsic metrics on the surfaces @xmath24 and @xmath25 coincide with the relative metrics @xmath26 and @xmath27 on the boundaries of the domains @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and thus , the problem of unique determination of closed convex surfaces by their intrinsic metrics is indeed a particular case of the problem of unique determination of domains by the relative metrics on their boundaries .",
    "the generalization of the problem of the unique determination of surfaces ensuing from a new approach suggested in  @xcite manifests itself in the fact that the unique determination of domains by the relative metrics on their boundaries holds not only when their complements are bounded convex sets but , for example , also in the following cases .    _",
