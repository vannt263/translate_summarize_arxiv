    "this opens up the possibility to produce black holes at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "once formed , the black hole will decay by emitting hawking radiation.@xcite the final fate of the black hole is unknown since quantum gravity will become important as the black hole mass approaches the planck scale .",
    "if black holes are produced at the lhc , detecting them will not only test general relativity and probe extra dimensions , but will also teach us about quantum gravity .",
    "early discussions of black hole production in colliders postulated a @xmath0 form for the cross - section , where @xmath1 is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole formed in the parton scattering process.@xcite calculations based on classical general relativity have had limited success in improving the cross - section estimates.@xcite the effects of mass , spin , charge , colour , and finite size of the incoming particles are usually neglected .",
    "the effects of finite size have been examined@xcite and only recently have charge@xcite and spin@xcite been discussed .",
    "attempts have been made to account for angular momentum in a heuristic way by multiplying the simple expression for the cross - section by a form factor.@xcite although these results are far from complete , they do indicated that the simple geometric cross - section is correct if multiplied by a formation factor of order unity.@xcite    general relativistic calculations of the cross - section have usually been performed using the trapped - surface approach .",
    "the two incoming partons are modelled as aichelburg - sexl shock waves.@xcite spacetime is flat in all regions of space except at the shocks .",
    "the union of these shock waves defines a closed trapped surface .",
    "black hole formation can be predicted by identifying a future trapped surface , with no need to calculate the gravitational field .",
    "the trapped - surface approach was first applied to tev - scale gravity calculations by eardley and giddings@xcite in four dimensions .",
    "their work was extended to the @xmath2-dimensional case numerically by yoshino and nambu.@xcite the numerical studies were improved by yoshino and rychkov@xcite by analyzing the closed trapped surface on a future slice of spacetime .",
    "these general relativistic calculations have enabled lower limits to be obtained for the black hole mass produced by colliding particles in tev - scale gravity scenarios .    since",
    "black holes are highly massive objects , the momentum fraction of the partons in the protons that form them must be high . thus typically valence quarks",
    "will be involved in black hole formation .",
    "this means the most probable charge of the black hole in proton collisions will be @xmath3 . since the gravitational field of each particle",
    "is determined by its energy - momentum tensor , charge should affect the black hole formation .",
    "first exploratory work by yoshino and mann@xcite obtained a condition on the electric charges of the colliding particles for a closed trapped surface to form .",
    "the results depend on the standard model brane thickness .    in this paper , we take trapped energy into account and give limits on the cross - section .",
    "we derive lower limits on the planck scale based on estimates of the cross - section.@xcite we use the yoshino and mann charge condition in its general form and build on their work by examining the effect of charge on black hole production at the lhc.@xcite",
    "black hole solutions in higher dimensions have a complicated dependence on both the gravitational field of the brane and the geometry of the extra dimensions . however , there are two useful approximations that may be made for a wide class of models .",
    "the brane on which the standard model particles live , is expected to have a tension given by roughly the planck or string scale . for black holes with mass @xmath4 substantially heavier than the fundamental planck scale in higher dimensions @xmath5",
    ", the brane s field should be negligible and the production process for black holes should be non - perturbative .",
    "we will assume that the only effect of the brane field is to bind the black hole to the brane , and that otherwise the black hole may be treated as an isolated object in the extra dimensions .",
    "if the geometrical scales of the extra dimensions @xmath6 ( radii , curvature radii , variation scale of the warp factor ) are all large compared to @xmath7 , there is a wide regime in which the geometry of the extra dimensions plays no essential role .",
    "we consider black holes with horizon radius @xmath8 much smaller than the size of the extra dimensions , @xmath9 . under these assumptions",
    ", it is often a good approximation to consider the high - energy collision of the particles and the black hole formed to be in @xmath2-dimensional flat spacetime .",
    "since the black hole is not an ordinary particle of the standard model and its correct quantum theoretical treatment is unknown , it is treated as a quasi - stable state , which is produced and decays according to the semiclassical formalism of black hole physics . using the above approximations , it has been argued that at high energies black hole production has a good classical description.@xcite this leads to the naive estimate that the cross - section for black hole production is approximately given by the classical geometric cross - section @xmath10 , where @xmath1 is the @xmath2-dimensional schwarzschild radius corresponding to the black hole mass .",
    "it depends on the fundamental planck scale @xmath5 and the number of extra dimensions @xmath11 . in the high - energy limit ,",
    "the cross - section should depend on the impact parameter @xmath12 between the two partons , and a range of black hole masses will result for a given center of mass energy @xmath13 .",
    "since the cross - section is dominated geometrically by large impact parameters @xmath14 , the average black hole mass should be of the order of the center of mass energy , @xmath15 .",
    "it is often assumed that the black hole mass is given by @xmath16 .    in studying the uncertainties in the classical parton cross - section ,",
    "it is useful to examine a more general form of the cross - section    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is a form factor ( usually approximated as unity ) , @xmath8 is a more general horizon that may depend on the angular momentum and charges of the black hole ( usually taken to be the non - rotating non - charged schwarzschild radius in flat @xmath2-dimensions ) , and @xmath19 is a heaviside step function that allows black hole production only above some threshold mass @xmath20 ( often implicitly assumed ) . in addition , @xmath21 needs to be considered to allow for the possibility of not all the available energy being trapped behind the horizon .",
    "there exists a threshold for black hole production . in classical general relativity , two point - like particles in a head - on collision with zero impact parameter",
    "will always form a black hole , no matter how large or small their energy . at small energies",
    ", we expect this to be impossible due to the smearing of the wave function by the uncertainty relation .",
    "this then results in a necessary minimal energy to allow the required close approach .",
    "the threshold is of order @xmath5 , though the exact value is unknown since quantum gravity effects should play an important role for the wave function of the colliding particles . for simplicity ,",
    "it is usual to set this threshold equal to @xmath5 .    in the high - energy limit ,",
    "if the impact parameter is less than @xmath8 , a black hole with mass @xmath22 can be produced . to avoid quantum gravity effects and stay in the classical regime ,",
    "we require @xmath23 , where @xmath20 should be a few times larger than @xmath5 , although it is often taken as @xmath5 .",
    "a reasonable criterion for @xmath20 is given by the requirement of large entropy.@xcite in the following , we will find it useful to define the dimensionless parameter    @xmath24    and require @xmath25 .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the particle data group ( pdg)@xcite definition of the planck scale    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is newton s constant in four dimensions .",
    "only a fraction of the total center of mass energy @xmath28 in a proton - proton collision is available in the parton - parton scattering process .",
    "we define @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the fractional energies of the two partons relative to the proton energies .",
    "the full particle - level cross - section @xmath32 is obtained from the parton - level cross - section @xmath33 by using    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the proton .",
    "the sum is over all possible quark and gluon pairings . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the cteq6l1 ( leading order with leading order @xmath37 ) parton distributions functions@xcite within the les houches accord pdf framework .",
    "we have taken @xmath38 for the qcd scale .    since @xmath39",
    ", we can make a changing of variable from @xmath40 to @xmath4 to obtain the differential cross - section in terms of parton luminosity ( or parton flux )    @xmath41    the differential cross - section thus factorizes for the case of @xmath42 .",
    "it can be written as the product of the parton cross - section time a luminosity function .",
    "the parton cross - section is independent of the parton types and depends only on the black hole mass , planck scale , and number of extra dimensions .",
    "the parton luminosity function contains all the information about the partons . beside a dependence on black hole mass ,",
    "it is independent of the characteristics of the higher - dimensional space , i.e.  the planck scale and number of extra dimensions .",
    "the particle - level cross - section does not truly factorize if the horizon radius is used as the qcd scale in the parton density functions for the proton .",
    "classical general relativistic calculations indicate that the mass of a black hole formed in a head - on collision is somewhat less than the total center of mass energy ; the scattering is not completely inelastic",
    ". thus eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) should be modified by replacing the black hole mass by a fraction of the available center of mass energy , leading to a reduction in the cross - section .    to improve the naive picture of colliding point particles , we need to consider the grazing collision of particles in @xmath2-dimensional einstein gravity and investigate the formation of trapped surfaces .",
    "a common approach is to treat the creation of the horizon as a collision of two shock fronts in aichelburg - sexl geometry.@xcite the aichelburg - sexl metric is obtained by boosting the schwarzschild metric to form two colliding shock fronts . due to the high velocity of the moving particles , spacetime before and after",
    "the shocks is almost flat and the geometry can be examined for the occurrence of trapped surfaces , which depend on the impact parameter .",
    "eardley and giddings@xcite developed a method for finding the trapped surfaces for this system .",
    "for a nonzero impact parameter , they were able to solve the problem analytically for the @xmath43 case .",
    "they obtained limits on the final mass of the black hole formed and found a range from @xmath44 for @xmath45 to @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "this can be compared with a perturbative analysis that gave @xmath48.@xcite for higher dimensions , they solved the @xmath45 case to obtain lower bounds on the final black hole mass of @xmath44 to @xmath49 for @xmath43 to 7 .",
    "unfortunately the eardley and giddings results are not general enough to be useful for nonzero impact parameters and higher dimensions , but they indicate that a significant amount of the initial energy may not be trapped behind the horizon .",
    "understanding the case of a nonzero impact parameter in higher dimensions is crucial to improving the cross - section estimates .",
    "the analytic techniques used to study head - on collisions in general relativity are not applicable to collisions at nonzero impact parameter . thus the claim that a black hole will be produced when @xmath50 can only be expected to be true up to a numerical factor .",
    "yoshino and nambu@xcite solved this problem numerically for @xmath51 and obtained the maximal impact parameter @xmath52 . in their analysis",
    ", the trapped surface was constructed on the union of the two incoming shocks . however , this slice of spacetime is not optimal in the sense that there exists other slices located in the future .",
    "yoshino and rychkov@xcite improved the analysis by using a future slice .",
    "they found that the lower bound on the black hole mass formed is never more than 71% of the available energy .",
    "the fraction of energy available decreases with impact parameter and the number of extra dimensions , from 0.71 to 0.46 for @xmath43 and from 0.59 to 0 for @xmath53 .",
    "the mean lower bound on the trapped energies are about 0.6 and 0.27 for @xmath43 and 7 respectively .",
    "the following describes one approach to taking estimates of the non - trapped energy into account , and applying a minimum black hole mass cutoff to final results .",
    "we use the yoshino and rychkov@xcite data to obtain lower bounds on the black hole cross - section .",
    "previous calculations of the cross - section for producing a black hole have neglected energy loss , and assumed that the mass of the created black hole was identical to the incoming parton center of mass energy .",
    "however , recent work@xcite shows the energy loss to gravitational radiation is not negligible , and in fact is large for large number of extra dimensions and for large impact parameters .",
    "the trapped mass @xmath4 is given by ( using the notation of anchordoqui _",
    "et al_.@xcite )    @xmath54    where the inelasticity @xmath55 is a function of @xmath56 .",
    "this complicates the parton model calculations , since the production of a black hole of mass @xmath4 is lower than @xmath13 by @xmath57 , thus requiring the lower cutoff on the parton momentum fraction to be a function of the impact parameter .",
    "we can no longer use the factorized version of the particle - level cross - section given by eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "following anchordoqui _",

    "there are many uncertainties in our understanding of black hole production in higher dimensional tev - scale gravity .",
    "reliable predictions of the cross - section are not yet available .",
    "we have explored some options for filling in the gaps in our understanding . in this way",
    ", we hope to be better prepared to confront the possibility of black hole production at the lhc ."

    "<S> black hole production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is an interesting consequence of tev - scale gravity models . the predicted values , or lower limits , for the fundamental planck scale and number of extra dimensions will depend directly on the accuracy of the black hole production cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> we give a range of lower limits on the fundamental planck scale that could be obtained at lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we examine the effects of parton electric charge on black hole production using the trapped - surface approach of general relativity . accounting for electric charge of the partons could reduce the black hole cross - section by one to four orders of magnitude at the lhc . </S>"
