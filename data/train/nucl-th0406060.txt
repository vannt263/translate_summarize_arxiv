    "unfortunately , to attribute the points to the respective sheets through the available numerical data becomes problematic already for relatively small dimensions and the study of effects connected with increasing boson numbers seems intractable .",
    "the above problem can be approached via the relation of the ground - state related exceptional points to zeros of partition function .",
    "we will use the correspondence @xmath72 between the partition function and @xmath73 partial discriminant ( [ disck ] ) .",

    "note that an arbitrary power of @xmath78 used in the thermodynamic correspondence would modify just the overall scaling factor @xmath86 .",
    "this factor must also depend on the size of the system ( similarly as the thermodynamic specific heat is normalized to a mass unit ) and will be discussed later . eq .",
    "( [ heat ] ) can be further decomposed @xcite into a double sum of terms containing energy differences ( in denominators ) and matrix elements of @xmath87 ( in numerators ) , cf .",
    "( [ heat1 ] ) .",
    "although the quantity @xmath88 depends solely on real-@xmath4 spectral observables , its behavior in a qpt is an indirect measure of the density of exceptional points on the ground - state riemann sheet beyond ( but close to ) the real axis .",
    "consider , for instance , a chain @xmath89 of @xmath78 zeros along a line perpendicular to the real axis .",
    "the @xmath90 polynomial is determined ( up to a multiplicative constant ) by the roots and specific heat ( [ heat ] ) is for real @xmath4 given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is a density of exceptional points along the @xmath94 line .",
    "this implies that the latent heat  @xmath95 is equal to zero if @xmath96 decreases sufficiently fast when approaching the real axis . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath97 for @xmath98 , we obtain the following possibilities : ( i ) a first - order qpt , with @xmath99 at @xmath100 and @xmath101 finite , for @xmath102 , ( ii ) second - order qpt , with @xmath99 but @xmath103 , for @xmath104 $ ] , and ( iii ) a higher - order qpt , with @xmath88 finite and @xmath103 , for @xmath105 .",
    "this relation is the same as in standard thermodynamics , where the order of a phase transition reflects the density of the @xmath13 zeros close to a critical temperature @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that in the qpt case the order deduced from @xmath88 can not be _ a priori _ expected to coincide with the order determined via @xmath48 .",
    "we will focus on this problem in the following , using the ibm .",
    "the specific heat @xmath88 in the ibm first- and second - order qpt is for @xmath107 shown in fig .",
    "[ figheat ] , where panels ( a ) and ( b ) again correspond to @xmath49 and 0 , respectively .",

    "we know that for @xmath42 some pairs of levels actually cross at real @xmath4 ( due to the seniority quantum number @xmath69 ) .",
    "this implies discontinuities and singularities of the first and second derivatives in eq .",

    "( [ heat ] ) for both levels is the same , but with opposite signs , so the sum of both contributions is incremented correctly , as if the levels continuously passed the crossing . ]",
    "it is clear that the peaks in panels ( a ) of both figs .",
    "[ figheat1 ] and [ figheat ] are sharper and higher than those in panels ( b ) , as indeed expected in the first- and second - order phase transitions .",
    "the log - log insets in these figures indicate that maximal values@xmath109 and @xmath110in the @xmath48 and @xmath88 peaks exhibit roughly an algebraic increase with the boson number .",
    "the increase is faster for the first - order qpt than for the second - order one .",
    "we will show that with a proper normalization to the system s size , the values of @xmath109 and @xmath110 corresponding to the second - order qpt have a finite @xmath35 asymptotics , while the values of the first - order qpt , normalized in the same way , diverge .",
    "[ asymp ] shows the dependence of @xmath111 and @xmath112 for the second - order qpt on the boson number up to @xmath113 .",
    "the calculation for such high dimensions was enabled by the underlying o(5 ) symmetry for @xmath42 . clearly , the curves in fig .",

    "energy per boson .",
    "the faster increase of @xmath109 in the first - order transition , see fig .",
    "[ figheat1](a ) , indicates a divergence of @xmath51 at @xmath115 for @xmath39 .",

    "[ asymp]in this case the correct normalization is by @xmath116 .",
    "this factor reflects the dimension of the subspace of states with @xmath64 which grows roughly as @xmath117 for very large boson numbers ( while the total number of ibm states is @xmath118 ) .",
    "since there are @xmath75 pairs of exceptional points on each riemann sheet , the choice of @xmath119 in eq .",
    "( [ heat ] ) normalizes the density @xmath96 [ cf .",
    "( [ cline ] ) ] in the finite-@xmath58 case to a unit integral and plays a similar role as the @xmath120 scaling of @xmath48 in the previous case . with this normalization ,",
    "the specific heat @xmath88 correctly distinguishes the ibm first- and second - order phase transitions .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the analysis of the ibm classical limit . indeed , due to the degeneracy of @xmath45 and @xmath121 minima of the @xmath35 g.s .",
    "energy per boson at @xmath6 @xcite , there is an exceptional point on the ground - state riemann sheet that is for the infinite boson number located on the real axis , at the first - order qpt .",
    "consequently , energy denominators in eq .",
    "( [ heat ] ) diverge at this point in a way that appears to be faster than @xmath122 .",
    "in contrast , there is no actual ground - state involving degeneracy in the asymptotic limit of the second - order transition , although , as can be shown , exceptional points come infinitely close to the real axis at the critical point .",
    "this results in a slower increase , which is compensated by the @xmath116 scaling .    for @xmath42",
    ", we can additionally check the validity of the @xmath123 normalization of specific heat ( [ heat ] ) by considering only the @xmath124 subspace of @xmath64 states , with the dimension @xmath125 .",
    "since this subspace contains the ground state and does not mix with @xmath126 subspaces , one can restrict the sum in eq .",
    "( [ heat ] ) only to these states and obtain a modified specific heat @xmath127 .",
    "it is expected to have a similar behavior as @xmath88 , but with @xmath128 .",
    "unfortunately , the convergence of the maximal value @xmath129 to some asymptotics is very slow . the available data for boson numbers up to 5000 ( see the inset in fig .  [ asymp ] )",
    "can only yield an upper constraint for the power in @xmath130 , namely @xmath131 , which is consistent with the expectation but not fully conclusive .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "we have developed a method capable to indirectly measure the distribution of exceptional points of hamiltonian ( [ hamg ] ) on the ground - state riemann sheet near the real-@xmath4 axis .",
    "this distribution plays major role in structural changes of the g.s . wave function .",
    "it is crucial in the determination of zero - temperature quantum phase transitions , but numerically difficult to be calculated directly for large dimensions .",
    "the method is based on the analogy between generic qpt arrangements of exceptional points and similar behaviors of complex zeros of the canonical partition function in thermodynamic phase transitions . the resulting formula ( [ heat ] ) for the specific heat   @xmath88 normalized with respect to the relevant dimension , @xmath132 , turned out to be the appropriate measure for the cumulation of exceptional points near the qpt critical point .",
    "our approach was tested in the interacting boson model , where @xmath88 in the first- and second - order qpt s was shown to behave in the same way as standard specific heat in typical thermodynamic phase transitions of the respective orders .",
    "we expect that the method is applicable also in other qpt systems , even beyond nuclear physics .",
    "it discloses surprising analogy between standard thermodynamics and quantum mechanics of parameter - dependent systems .",
