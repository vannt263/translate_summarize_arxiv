    "the agn unification theory @xcite has been subject to many successes and , also , some controversies . in its simplest form only the viewing angle towards the torus matters .",
    "this basic picture has long been challenged by statistical tests @xcite .",
    "many statistical tests are often overlooked due to anisotropic sample selection or small sample sizes @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that even with isotropic selection criteria and large sample sizes of thousands of pairs , the galaxy neighbours to type-1 and type-2 agn differ significantly @xcite within a few hundred kiloparsec , including a difference in the number of close neighbour galaxies @xcite .",
    "this claim is not uncontroversial .",
    "seemingly , gordon et al .",
    "( 2016 ) do not find any differences in the galaxy neighbours .",
    "however , their study suffers from poor statistics ( using only tens of pairs ) and does not mention some significant colour differences they find in neighbours , see @xmath6-values from the kolmogoroff - smirnoff tests in table 4 of @xcite .",
    "recent works @xcite support that factors beyond the viewing angle must play a role @xcite .",
    "some believe the torus is a nuclear stellar nursery driven by inflows and outflows @xcite or the outer parts of a disk - wind coming from the accretion disk @xcite , driving an evolutionary sequence from type-1 @xmath7 type 1.2/1.5 @xmath7 1.8/1.9 @xmath7 type-2 @xcite .",
    "presence of spectral features at 10 and 18 @xmath8 indicate that the agn has different clumpiness of the torus depending on if it is a type-1 or type-2 agn and if isolated or in merger @xcite . the absence of detected broad - line regions in low - luminosity agn @xcite , and lack of tori at the high - luminosity end , further complicate the picture .",
    "these findings open up for some important questions : what are the true physical differences between the type-1 and type-2 agn populations ?",
    "differences could lie in the physics of the central engines , in the structure of the tori @xcite , but also in the host galaxies themselves , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the star - formation histories of the host galaxies can be readily compared with the help of supernovae ( sne ) , requiring no assumptions about the composition of the galaxy spectra .",
    "the luminosity - weighted age of the stellar population is reflected in the occurrence of different sn types : progenitors of core - collapse ( c - c ) sne are massive stars ( @xmath9 ) with short life - times ( @xmath10 yrs ) and indicate recent or ongoing star formation .",
    "thermonuclear sne , whose progenitors are white dwarfs that take on average @xmath11 years to form , are indicators of earlier epochs of star formation .",
    "early - type galaxies which are dominated by old stellar populations are not known to host core - collapse sne , whereas thermonuclear sne are found in all types of galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent works indicate a larger fraction of core - collapse to thermonuclear sne in non - active , star - forming spirals than in spirals hosting agn .",
    "this fraction is connected to the earlier morphological type of the agn hosts @xcite and the stage of eventual merger in close pairs of galaxies @xcite .    in agn unification theory the sn counts and types are expected to be the same for both classes of agn . in this study using sne from the intermediate palomar transient factory ( iptf ) , we test whether type-1 and type-2 agn host galaxies have the same or different occurence rates of sne .",
    "different sn rates would indicate these agn types reside in galaxies with different star - formation histories .    the agn and galaxy samples",
    "are taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite data release 7 @xcite .",
    "the sne are taken from the iptf catalogue .",
    "this survey is well suited for this work due to its coherent , untargeted mode of detecting transient sources with one and the same telescope .    in section [ sec : methods ] we discuss the sample selection and methods . in section [ sec : results ] the main results , in section [ sec : biases ] different potential biases that can influence the results . in section [ sec : statistical ] we present the statistical analysis .",
    "finally , we present the conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the iptf is an un - targeted wide - field sky survey using the 1.2 m samuel oschin telescope ( p48 ) at palomar observatory to detect and follow up transient astronomical sources .",
    "the scientific scope of the iptf spans from small solar system objects to extragalactic phenomena .",
    "the iptf project has been running since 2013 , and it had a precursor , the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) , which was active during 2009 - 2012 .",
    "the technical background of ptf is presented in @xcite and the scientific motivation in @xcite .",
    "the iptf is presented in @xcite . for brevity",
    ", we will refer to our sn catalogue ( including sne found during the ptf period ) simply as the iptf catalogue .    in this study",
    ", we use the iptf sn catalogue from the time window between 2009 march 2 until 2014 june 17 .",
    "this catalogue contains 2190 extragalactic sne with known right ascension ( @xmath12 ) , declination ( @xmath13 ) , spectroscopic redshift ( @xmath14 ) and spectroscopic classification .",
    "this sn catalogue contains 1494 thermonuclear sne ( i.e. type ia ) and 632 core - collapse sne . in the core - collapse category ,",
    "we include sne types ib , ic , ib / c , ibn , ii , iip , iil , iin and iib .",
    "the remaining 64 sne are either of unclear spectroscopic type or superluminous sne .",
    "none of the 11 superluminous sne with @xmath15 in our catalogue was found in a galaxy with a spectrum in sdss dr7 .",
    "the superluminous sne can therefore , for our purposes , be included in the remainder category .",
    "the sne in this sample are located at declinations @xmath16 , mostly at galactic latitudes @xmath17 .",
    "the mean redshift of the sample is @xmath18 , with 95 % of the sne having @xmath15 . for a motivation of curtailing the sn catalogue at 2014 june 17 ,",
    "[ sec : snbiasiptf ] .",
    "an advantage of the iptf catalogue is its cohesive nature .",
    "all the sne have been discovered during an untargeted search with the same telescope , and spectroscopic classifications have been made in a timely fashion .",
    "the compatibility with sdss in sky coverage makes the iptf sne sample suitable for our investigation .",
    "our sdss samples covers @xmath19 and galactic latitudes @xmath17 , comparable to the distribution of the sn locations .",
    "another sn catalogue that comes to mind is the sdss sn catalogue @xcite .",
    "the 902 confirmed sne in the sdss sn survey represents a sn sample of smaller scope than the iptf sample .",
    "not all sne are spectroscopically classified , but the survey is deep and homogenous .",
    "unfortunately , the sne are all located in the sdss southern equatorial stripe 82 , which is outside the area of the sdss dr7 sample from the central region used in this study .",
    "this renders the sdss sne unsuitable for our purposes .",
    "the asiago sn catalogue @xcite is a historically comprehensive compilation of extragalactic sne .",
    "the catalogue encompasses 6530 sne as of 2016 march 27 , in both hemispheres .",
    "the asiago catalogue is extensive but has uneven quality  some of the sne in it lack spectroscopic classification , some lack spectroscopic redshift .",
    "the sn catalogue compiled by @xcite contains data for 5526 extragalactic sne , whereas the sternberg sn catalogue , presented by @xcite , contains less than 3000 extragalactic sne .",
    "the circumstance that they are compiled from a wide range of sources make them less suitable compared to the cohesive iptf catalogue .",
    "the same holds for the open supernova catalogue @xcite , with @xmath20 sne ( of which 12 % have spectra in the catalogue ) as of 2016 december , collected from different public sources .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , earlier sn searches have prioritised sn detection over completeness with respect to sn types or host galaxy types .",
    "this bias should affect such compilations as the asiago catalogue and other catalogues listing sne found before the start of untargeted sn searches .",
    "the samples of host galaxies were obtained through the sdss data release 7 .",
    "we select objects classified as either quasars or galaxies , within redshift @xmath21 , unless flagged for brightness ( flags&0x2=0 ) , saturation ( flags&0x40000=0 ) , or blending ( flags&0x8=0 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their table 9 ) .",
    "the emission lines are obtained from the specline table in dr7 .",
    "we require that the objects have h@xmath12 in emission and select type-1 agn , type-2 agn and star - forming galaxies using optical emission line diagnostics .",

    ", we classify the objects into type-1s , type-2s and star - forming galaxies , referred to as `` largest samples '' , using optical emission line diagnostics . for all objects we search for morphological classifications ( spiral , elliptical , uncertain ) from the project galaxy zoo 1 @xcite , emission line measurements , redshifts and celestial coordinates , leaving `` parent samples '' of 11632 type-1 agn ( 1864 spiral ) , 77708 type-2 agn ( 36720 spiral ) and 137489 star - forming galaxies ( 49072 spiral ) . for the vast majority of these objects we can also find wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) magnitudes .      as additional samples later used only for direct comparison of host galaxy properties",
    ", we also create some refined samples. starting from the parent samples , we select only face - on spiral hosts with high s / n in the emission lines from galaxy zoo data release 2 @xcite , minimizing dust extinction due to host galaxy inclination .",
    "we also require @xmath25 3 in h@xmath12 , minimum sdss gaussian line heights @xmath26(h@xmath12 ) @xmath22 10 * 10@xmath27erg / s/@xmath28/  and h(h@xmath29 ) @xmath22 5 * 10@xmath27erg / s/@xmath28/ in order to avoid effects of stellar absorption affecting weak lines in our classification . out of these , we select only those having wise colours .",
    "the refined samples will be used for comparing star formation with wise colours in type-1 and type-2 agn or the [ ] 5007 in host galaxies matched by amount of dust .",
    "the numbers of coherently collected sne are scarce ( 2190 in our sample as on 2014 june 17 ) .",
    "thus , we create pairwise matched subsamples of type-1 agn , type-2 agn and star - forming objects to compare objects as similar to each other as possible in redshift distribution and selected properties e.g. the luminosity @xmath4[]5007 .",
    "we compare ( i ) type-1 agn to type-2 agn , and ( ii ) type-2 agn to star - forming galaxies .",
    "the aim with the latter test is to probe whether the observed type-2 agn properties can be explained by star formation alone .    for two samples of intrinsically similar objects",
    "the probability of detecting faint sne is the same if they have similar redshift distributions .",
    "therefore , for each galaxy in the parent sample , we select a galaxy from the second parent sample having the closest value in redshift and a specific property of interest .",
    "after the matching is done , we first throw away all matched pairs that differ more than 20% in the property of interest .    four types of specific properties and matchings are explored :    1 .",
    "redshift only .",
    "this allows to remove biases in galaxy zoo morphology classifications as well as the malmquist bias .",
    "@xmath4[]5007 from the narrow - line region ( nlr ) . in the simplest agn unification ,",
    "the nlr is believed to be isotropically distributed outside the torus and to be equally strong for agn of the same activity level irrespective of the viewing angle . selecting on @xmath4[]5007  meaning one selects all type-1 and type-2 agn above a selected certain line flux in a sample",
    " should give the same host galaxy properties under the conditions of isotropy @xcite .",
    "matching on @xmath4[]5007 is similar to selecting on @xmath4[]5007 if the two @xmath4[]5007 distributions are the same ( as predicted by the simplest unification ) but can be problematic if the distributions differ at the high - luminosity end .",
    "moreover , we expect the same line width @xmath1[]5007 in matched samples type-1 and type-2 agn samples .",
    "wise @xmath30 ( 22@xmath8 ) absolute magnitude .",
    "we use this match as our stellar - mass proxy assuming the dust emission traces the stellar mass .",
    "the 22@xmath8 magnitude is a good measure of heated - dust emission in the host galaxy , especially in galaxies where the torus contribution to the total 22@xmath8 is negligible in comparison , meaning galaxies having @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a less favourable option is to use dust reddening @xmath31(h@xmath12/h@xmath29 ) , but if dust reddening in the blr and nlr differs @xcite , the matching will be biased .",
    "we therefore neither correct @xmath4[]5007 for dust reddening .",
    "this matching is only done for the galaxies in the parent samples that have wise magnitudes .",
    "4 .   exponential fit scale radius ( r - band ) .",
    "as the star - formation history depends on the available gas mass , matching by an apparent measure of the galaxy volume should minimize differences in star - formation histories under the assumption of a mass - size relation .",
    "we do a two - sample kolmogoroff - smirnoff test for each matched property to ensure the sample distributions are statistically similar . for the @xmath30-matched samples we had to do a finer match by throwing away matched pairs differing more than 5% in @xmath30 .",
    "the pairwise matched subsamples for examining sn counts are created by matching in three different parameters ( redshift @xmath32 , luminosity @xmath4[]5007 and @xmath33 ) as described earlier . the sizes of the pairwise matched subsamples can be found in table [ supernovaall ] .",
    "an example of the redshift and property distributions in the matched type-1 and type-2 samples can be seen in figure [ redshiftdistributions ] and [ otherdistributions ] .",
    "the similarity of all the matched samples is ensured through two - sample kolmogoroff - smirnoff where the null hypothesis ( that two matched samples are similar ) holds for the nominal value @xmath12=0.05 .",
    "the procedure is repeated for pairwise matched type-2 agn and star - forming galaxies .",
    "finally , the refined samples of face - on hosts with high signal - to - noise are also matched with the same method .",
    "in addition , the refined samples are matched by balmer decrement @xmath31(h@xmath12)/@xmath31(h@xmath29 ) .",
    "a sn is considered to be matched with a galaxy if the following two conditions are both satisfied :    * the projected distance on the plane of the sky between the sn and the galaxy is computed ( plane approximation ) .",
    "the search radius @xmath34 is set by converting the desired physical search radius into a angular radius at a galaxy distance assumed to be @xmath35 .",
    "a hubble constant @xmath36 = 72 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 is used throughout this work .",
    "if the sn is found to lie inside the given search radius , the compliance with a redshift condition is also checked . *",
    "our redshift condition is @xmath40 and accounts for redshifts due to peculiar motions .",
    "this is more strict than the redshift matching condition of @xmath41 used in the study by @xcite . in their study , however , most ( 97 % ) of their sample of 620 cross - matches fulfills the @xmath40 condition .",
    "if both these conditions are fulfilled , the sn is considered to be associated with the galaxy .",
    "the sne inside a galaxy are collected by the @xmath42 10 kpc , and those inside a galaxy or in a close companion are found with the @xmath42 100 kpc criterion . if this is wrong and there is no association between the agn and the sn , then the distribution of different sne with different @xmath43 = @xmath44 ought to be a uniform distribution .",
    "this can be checked by plotting a histogram with the @xmath43 between the agn and the sne , see fig [ supernovagalaxydelta ] .",
    "it is clear that the distribution is bottom - heavy and that most of the sne are associated with the host galaxies .",
    "it is important to point out , that the sn redshift determination method brings in uncertainty regarding the redshift uncertainties .",
    "most of the time the redshift is measured from the host galaxy of the sn and is rather accurate .",
    "but sometimes , the sn redshift is measured directly from the sn itself and influenced by doppler broadening and expansion velocities , being slightly larger @xcite .",
    "the degree of association between sne and galaxies can also be checked by visually inspecting the sdss dr7 images of the galaxies , with the sn positions overplotted .",
    "we note the subjectivity involved , e.g. in cases where a sn occurs in an interacting pair of galaxies . for the largest sample of type-2 agns ( 77708 galaxies ) , and the 59 sne matched to them , about 10 % of the sne visually appears to be located in a companion galaxy of a sample galaxy . for the largest sample of starforming galaxies ( 137489 galaxies ) , and",
    "the 152 sne matched to them , a comparable fraction ( about 9 % ) appears to be located in a companion galaxy .",
    "these results from visual inspection of sn positions complements the conclusions drawn from fig .",
    "[ supernovagalaxydelta ] .",
    "we begin our analysis by counting sne within two different projected distances from the center of the host galaxies : 10 kpc ( within the typical radius of a spiral galaxy ) , 100 kpc ( within the galaxy or a possible close companion ) .",
    "we start with the largest samples , see table [ largest ] .",
    "the first thing to notice is the lack of sne around type-1 agn at projected separations d @xmath23 100 kpc",
    ". only one sn is found .",
    "the number of sne around type-2 agn are clearly systematically higher for the largest samples in table [ largest ] ( size of effect @xmath0 5.1@xmath1 ) .",
    "we verify that this is no bias due to potential difficulties in detecting sn in the immediate vicinity of bright or transient agn by excluding all sne within 3 arcseconds from the host centres , see section 4.3.2 .",
    "this still yields 1 sn near 11632 type-1 agn ( detection fraction @xmath0 8.6 @xmath45 10@xmath46 ) and 46 sn near 77708 type-2 agn ( detection fraction @xmath0 5.9 @xmath45 10@xmath47 )  a significant difference ( size of effect @xmath484.1 @xmath1 , see section [ sec : unc ] ) .",
    "visual inspection show that the majority of the sne ( @xmath22 90 % ) come directly from the agn hosts ( only a small fraction from the companion galaxies ) .    for the type-1 and type-2 samples matched in redshift or @xmath30 the differences are significant .",
    "but for the @xmath4[]5007-matched samples we only find one sn in each sample , yielding no difference at all .",
    "does this mean the simplest unification is valid and there is no difference in galaxy properties and sn counts in samples selected and matched in @xmath4[]5007 ?",
    "if so , also the host morphologies for the matched samples should be the same .",
    "but the fraction of type-1 and type-2 agn in spiral hosts is 20 % vs 44 % , in disagreement with the simplest unification .",
    "this suggests that the lack of significant difference in sn counts stems from poor statistics .    as an alternative test",
    ", we select on @xmath4[]5007",
    ". this should be suitable as in the simplest unification no difference is expected in @xmath4[]5007 on the higher luminosity - end ( while matching removes potential differences at the high - luminosity end ) .",
    "we do this twice for the largest samples using both @xmath31[]5007 @xmath49 @xmath45 10@xmath50 erg / s/@xmath28 and @xmath31[]5007 @xmath51 @xmath45 10@xmath50 erg / s/@xmath28 as flux limits .",
    "the difference in @xmath4[]5007-selected type-1 and type-2 agn samples is noteable ( @xmath31[]5007 @xmath52 case : size of effect @xmath482.8 @xmath1 , @xmath31[]5007 @xmath51 case : 1.8 @xmath1 ) following the same trend of table [ largest ] .",
    "this reflects purely changes in the sample sizes , unless the difference in matched vs selected samples originates in a break - down of unification at the higher luminosities .    as",
    "early - type objects are well - known @xcite for having few sne setting off , it would be ideal to use only spiral hosts .",
    "we do not find a single sn around spiral type-1 agn . but using a statistical hypothesis test @xcite ( see section [ sec : pairwise ] ) only a borderline - significant difference in sn counts for type-1 and type-2 agn at @xmath42 100 kpc ( p - value @xmath0 0.06 ) is found , showing the need of larger sn samples .    for the pairwise matched samples the counts are too small to show any significance individually .",
    "the @xmath4[]5007-matched samples we commented upon earlier , while for the redshift - matched samples a significant difference is found for @xmath42 10 kpc .",
    "the lack of significant difference for @xmath42 100 kpc therefore stems from the poor statistics .",
    "the samples matched in redshift and apparent galaxy size yield small , insignificant differences between type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "as the size of the galaxy depends on the star - formation history , no difference in counts could mean that we have either matched successfully in the star - formation history , or more realistically , that the sample sizes are too small .",
    "however , the collected results in table [ supernovaall ] are visually presented in figure [ supernovacountsplot ] where the left column reinforces our earlier conclusions : type-2 agn hosts have higher sn rates than type-1 agn hosts , much higher than from the expectations of the simplest unification theory ( represented by the grey line ) .",
    "also the insignificant differences fall into the same area of the plot .",
    "the larger count of sne could mean either a difference in stellar age or stellar mass ( or both ) .",
    "but samples unmatched in stellar mass lead to differences in clustering on mpc scale @xcite while we find no differences in sn counts on large scale , see sections [ sec : largescale1 ] and [ sec : largescale2 ] . moreover , the matching in @xmath30  our proxy for stellar mass  still yields significant different sn counts .",
    "this suggests that the discrepancy in sn counts is due to differences in stellar age between type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "the conclusion is supported by the much higher @xmath53 colour indices in type-2s indicating stronger star formation @xcite in samples consisting of face - on , spiral - host type-1 and type-2 agn that are dominated by dust emission from stars with @xmath2 @xcite and pair - wise matched in @xmath4[]5007 , see section [ sec : altsfr ] .",
    "less striking differences are found between type-2 agn and star - forming galaxies .",
    "star - forming spirals show higher core - collapse sn counts at d @xmath23 10 kpc ( @xmath0 3.3@xmath1 ) and even in the redshift - matched samples a difference is present .",
    "the right column in figure [ supernovacountsplot ] shows a relationship between the two classes , although offset in y - axis following the shape of the grey line .",
    "one may argue that the @xmath4[]5007 may be anisotropic or even have different physical origins in type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "if so , one expects to find differences in the gaussian line width of the [ ] 5007 emission in type-1s and type-2s and/or differences in sn counts .      as type-1 agn",
    "have a contribution of a non - stellar , power - law continuum component to their observed luminosity , this could influence the detections of type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "however , the emission lines are independent of the continuum emission and in the simplest unification @xmath4[]5007 is expected to be an isotropic indicator of agn luminosity .",
    "type-1 and type-2 samples selected on , or matched in , @xmath4[]5007 should be the same in all other properties : they should have similar host galaxy types and similar nlr kinematics .",

    "we see no difference , or can not see , in the sn counts near type-1 and type-2 agn : we find one sn near type-1 hosts and one sn near type-2 hosts .    while matching is good , a better way is still to select on @xmath31[]5007 . selecting on @xmath31[]5007",
    "means that all type-1 and type-2 above a certain flux value in @xmath31[]5007 should have the same properties .",

    "however , we need to perform a test for the second potential bias .",
    "the impact of the second bias can be weakened by only considering sne appearing at angular distances from agn @xmath75 .",
    "this is generously larger than what is called for by the @xmath74 matching condition .",
    "we will herein present three different tests that probe the two biases .",

    "we remind that all 2190 sne used in our study are spectroscopically classified ( sect .",
    "[ sec : iptf ] ) .",
    "since not all sn candidates found by iptf with the p48 telescope were eventually spectroscopically classified , we have to examine whether a bias against classification of sne residing in either agn type 1 or type 2 hosts was somehow introduced when sn classification targets were selected . such bias ,",
    "if present , would adversely affect the usefulness of our sn sample .    to examine if there is a bias , we manually vetted all transients found during our 2009 - 2014 period in vicinity ( on the plane of the sky ) of our agn sample galaxies .",
    "the search radius around each galaxy was set as the apparent size of 100 kpc at the distance of each galaxy .",
    "we noted that , around both types of agns , about 1/3 of the likely sn candidates found were eventually classified spectroscopically .",
    "the similarity in fraction of sn candidates spectroscopically classified in and around our agn type-1 and type-2 hosts , respectively , shows that our sn sample is suitable for our study .      adding the harsh condition of at least @xmath79 separation when matching our 2190 sne gives in total 1 sn around 11632 type-1s ( detection fraction @xmath0 8.6 @xmath57 10@xmath46 ) and 46 sne around 77708 type-2s ( detection fraction @xmath0 5.9 @xmath57 10@xmath47 ) for @xmath77 kpc and the largest host samples",
    ". the estimated size of effect is @xmath0 4.1@xmath1 in this case .",
    "visual inspection of iptf discovery images of sne found @xmath80 from an agn show it is generally easy for a scanner to unambiguously tell if a sn candidate is separated from the central region of a galaxy . the demonstration that even such a conservative limit",
    "as @xmath78 can maintain a @xmath0 4.1@xmath1 effect suggests that we are seeing a physical effect and not a bias effect .",
    "we can also explore possible detection effects by looking at the number of foreground and background sne .",

    "we find no sne in apparent vicinity of any agn , in the foreground or background , within projected distance @xmath81 kpc .",
    "no significant difference in sne counts are found around the largest host samples either .",
    "another way of exploring whether or not there is a different detection rate of sne near type-1s and type-2s , is by counting the number of sne at large projected separations . at sufficiently large separations",
    "one expects the agn neither influence their surroundings nor the surroundings to influence the agn significantly . on the other hand , some recent articles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest unobscured ( presumably type-1s ) agn reside in less dense large - scale ( mpcs ) environments than obscured ( presumably type-2s ) agn .",
    "such an effect would influence the stellar mass and also the sn rate that is expected to be higher in the obscured agn case .",
    "we use the @xmath83 0.003 but now select sne within @xmath82 kpc , where effects are expected to disappear . for redshift - matched samples of 10146 type-1 and type-2 agn , we see that for type-1 agn we find 22 sne ( detection fraction @xmath0 2.2 @xmath57 10@xmath84 ) , and for type-2 agn we find 15 sne ( detection fraction @xmath0 1.5 @xmath57 10@xmath84 ) , yielding no significant difference in the large - scale environment . for none of the samples we find significant differences in the detected sne rate for type-1s and type-2s in an annulus of @xmath82 kpc , supporting our claim that the detection of sne near type-1s and type-2s in iptf is not biased in favour of any of the two agn types .",
    "a statistical analysis of the results can be done in several different ways .",
    "we can get an estimate of the size of effect without assuming anything about the underlying distributions ( section [ sec : unc ] ) . a detection signal from estimating at what level the reported difference between the two samples is just by chance can be obtained by assuming the two agn samples have equal sn rates as the null hypothesis ( section [ sec : nulldist ] ) .",

    "if we compare the @xmath4[]5007-matched type-1 galaxies ( @xmath64=6252 ) and type-2 galaxies ( @xmath64=6252 ) used for sn counts , we can get a rough estimate of the fraction of agn that are obscured only by the torus using the nave assumption that there is a one - to - one correspondence in expected properties between the objects within each @xmath4[]5007-matched pair of host galaxies , i.e. same galaxy zoo morphology , and with measured exponential fit scale radius & @xmath30 within 20% error .",
    "the fraction of objects fulfilling these criteria shows that 10% can be explained purely by ( parsec - size ) torus obscuration and agree with the predictions from the simplest unification about identical host galaxy properties .",
    "( using the @xmath4[]5007-matched refined samples based on spiral face - on hosts , the corresponding nave fraction is 25% . )",
    "this also means that for majority of type-2 agn , up to 90% , the obscuration must stem from larger scales : host galaxy obscuration and/or large - scale environment in which the host galaxies reside .",
    "the finding that @xmath30-matched type-1 agn are significantly more luminous in [ ] 5007 than the type-2 agn in host - matched samples , asks for a physical connection between the agn classes that goes beyond pure obscuration .",
    "perhaps the two important differences between type-1 and type-2 agn that we find on a population level  the different average agn luminosity and the different stellar ages of the host galaxies  can be explained within the framework of an evolutionary scenario @xcite where the type-2 agn are those with obscured by heavy star formation during the initial agn phase after the merger , where the agn becomes stronger and stronger until the `` blow - out phase '' is reached , later leading to a strong , naked `` unobscured '' agn with less dust and gas .",
    "the agn environment also supports this scenario through differences in neighbour counts @xcite and neighbour properties @xcite .",
    "the torus could be a heavily star - forming molecular disk at @xmath182 pc where the sne keep up the geometrical thickness of the dust disk @xcite and is more likely to be heavily star - forming in gas - rich galaxies with younger stellar populations .",
    "the presence of starbursts @xcite and past starbursts @xcite in agn in the most central regions support the view of heavy star formation in the most central 100 pc .",
    "but the observed difference in luminosity between the @xmath30-matched seyfert-1 and seyfert-2 galaxies perhaps means we are dealing with a receding molecular disk . continued theoretical efforts into modeling the torus are therefore needed .",
    "using sne from the iptf and galaxies from the sdss , we have searched for possible physical differences between type-1 and type-2 agn . simultaneously",
    ", we have also carefully matched type-1 and type-2 agn host galaxies to gain information on the agn engine .",
    "we find that :    1 .",
    "the two agn classes differ in term of sn counts in their hosts .",
    "agn hosts have a larger number of sne .",
    "this differences appears to originate in a difference between stellar ages ( and not only stellar masses ) and more recent star formation in type-2 agn hosts .",
    "star - forming galaxies have more recent star formation than type-2 agn host .",
    "2 .   based on equal [ ] 5007 line widths in type-1 and type-2 agn ( significantly wider than in star - forming hosts ) ,",
    "there are good reasons to accept an isotropy in the [ ] 5007 distribution as long assumed by the simplest unification .",
    "type-1 and type-2 agn hosts that are dominated by star formation @xmath2 and are matched in cold dust emission have strong differences in nlr luminosity @xmath4[]5007 ",
    "type-1 agn being 10 times more luminous .    summarizing",
    ", we identify two more factors beyond the viewing angle  agn luminosity and the age of stellar populations  making unification not only a question of obscuration but also one of generation . finally , we conclude the great potential of iptf and surveys like the upcoming zwicky transient facility ( ztf ) , for resolving the question with larger sn samples .",
    "the ztf @xcite will use the same telescope as the iptf , but with a larger field of view , and is expected to start in 2017 .",
