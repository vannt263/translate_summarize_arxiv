    "studies of angular and energy dependence of muon flux at the earth s surface give important information as about processes of muon generation and propagation in the atmosphere so about primary cosmic rays .",
    "measurements of muon flux at large zenith angles up to 90@xmath0 are especially actual since primary particles for such muons have higher energies than in the vertical direction .",
    "experimental studies of muon intensity at large zenith angles at the ground level can be conditionally separated in two groups : measurements of muon integral intensity with threshold energies less than 1  gev [ 1][8 ] and investigations of integral and differential muon spectra for muon energies higher than 10  gev ( see review [ 9 ] ) .",
    "regions of measurements of muon spectrum at large zenith angles are presented in fig .",
    "it is remarkable that for threshold energies from 1  gev to 10  gev and zenith angles 60@xmath1 muon intensity data are absent .        to explore this region",

    "straight line connecting the middles of two reconstructed track segments is taken as the trajectory of the particle .",
    "* the events in which muon passed closer than 3  cm from the boundary of sm are rejected in order to decrease the edge effects .",
    "* there must be two and only two track projections ( x , y ) in each sm for unambiguous reconstruction of geometrical characteristics of muon track ( the absence of accompanying particles ) .",
