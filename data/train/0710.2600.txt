    "lhc will begin its first run pretty soon , and besides searching for the long - expected higgs boson , its main goal is to explore new physics beyond the sm .",
    "many schemes have been proposed to reach the goal .",
    "indeed , the lhcb detector , even though is not responsible for the higgs hunting , will provide an ideal place to study heavy flavor physics and search for evidence of new physics .",
    "one can make careful measurements on rare decays of b - mesons , b - baryons , b - mixing and cp violation with a huge database available at lhcb , moreover , we are inspired by the possibilities of discovering new physics .",
    "it would be beneficial to conjecture more possible processes which would signal existence of new physics .    in 2002 , the first event for doubly charmed baryon , @xmath3 , was observed by the selex collaboration in the channel of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 has the mass @xmath6 mev and width @xmath7 mev . by studying an alternative channel of @xmath8 conducted later ,",
    "the mass of the baryon - resonance was confirmed as @xmath9 mev @xcite , which is consistent with that given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present theory",
    ", there definitely is no reason to exclude existence of @xmath10 which contains @xmath11 valence quarks and as well @xmath12 and @xmath13 , by the flavor - su(3 ) symmetry .    in this work",
    ", we propose that direct decays of @xmath14 with charmless final states or @xmath15 with bottomless final states would be signals for new physics . by the quark - diagrams",
    ", one can easily notice that the main decay modes of @xmath14 would be @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the later two modes are just the channels where the selex collaboration observed the baryon @xmath14 . while the direct decays of @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) into charmless ( bottomless ) final states are suppressed in the standard model , so that would be sensitive to new physics beyond the sm .    since in @xmath14 there are two identical charm quarks which can neither annihilate , nor exchange w - boson to convert into other quarks .",
    "in the sm , direct transition of @xmath14 into charmless final states may realize via the double - penguin mechanism which is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , the crossed box - diagram ( fig . 1 ( b ) ) and a possible two - step process shown in fig . 1 ( c ) .",
    "the mechanism includes two penguin loops or a crossed box - diagram is very suppressed , so that can not result in any observable effects and we can ignore them completely . if a non - zero rate is observed at lhcb , it should be a signal of new physics .",
    "definitely the diagram of fig .",
    "1 ( c ) may cause a non - zero contribution and contaminate our situation for exploring new physics . if we consider the charmless decays of @xmath10 or bottomless decays of @xmath20 , that diagram ( fig",
    ". 1 ( c ) ) does not exist at all .",
    "then , the first question is that can we distinguish such direct decays of @xmath14 into charmless final states ( or @xmath15 into bottomless final states ) from the secondary decays which result in charmless ( or bottomless ) products and are the regular modes in the framework of the sm .",
    "the answer is that the direct transitions are favorably two - body decays , namely in the final states there are only two non - charmed hadrons by whose momenta one can re - construct the invariant mass spectra of @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) , whereas , in the regular modes with sequent decays , there are at least three hadrons in the final states .",
    "ccc + ( a ) +   + ( b ) +   + ( c )    the second question is that is there any mechanism beyond the standard model available which can result in such direct decays ?",
    "below , we use two models to demonstrate how such direct decay modes are induced and estimate the widths accordingly .",
    "one of them is the unparticle scenario and another one is the @xmath21 model where a new gauge boson @xmath1 exists and mediates an interaction to turn the charm quark into a @xmath22-quark .",
    "thus by exchange of an unparticle or @xmath1 between the two charm quarks in @xmath23 ( or between the two bottom quarks in @xmath24 ) , these direct transitions occur .    in this work , for simplicity",
    ", we only consider the inclusive decays of @xmath25 into charmless ( bottomless ) final states .",
    "the advantage of only considering the inclusive processes is obvious that we do not need to worry about the hadronization of quarks into final states because such processes are fully governed by the non - perturbative qcd effects and brings up much uncertainty .",
    "below , we will investigate the processes caused by exchanging unparticles and @xmath1 separately and then make a brief discussion on the possibility that new physics may result in observable phenomena at lhcb .",
    "before entering the concrete calculation , we briefly review the concerned knowledge on the unparticle physics @xcite , which is needed in later derivation . the effective lagrangian describing the interaction of the unparticle with the sm quarks is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the scalar and vector unparticle fields respectively . @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the sm quark fields . generally , the dimensionless coefficients @xmath31 is related to the flavor of the quark field .",
    "this interaction induces a fcnc and contributes to the processes of concern .    for a scalar unparticle field ,",
    "the propagator with momentum @xmath32 and scale dimension @xmath33 is @xcite @xmath34 with @xmath35 with @xmath33 the scale dimension .    for the vector unparticle",
    ", the propagator reads @xmath36 where the transverse condition @xmath37 is required .    in the unparticle physics ,",
    "the inclusive decay of doubly charmed baryons into light quarks @xmath38 occurs at the tree level , and the transition is depicted in fig .",

    "the exchanged agent between the two charm quarks can be either scalar or vector unparticle .     + ( a ) +   + ( b )    even though we only consider the inclusive processes where the quarks in the final states are treated as on - shell free particles and the wavefunctions of the light hadrons in the final states are not needed , the binding effect of the initial baryons ( @xmath10 or @xmath20 ) which are composed of three valence quarks must be taken into account .",
    "namely , when we calculate the hadronic matrix elements , we need to invoke concrete phenomenological models to carry out the computations where the wave function of the initial baryon is needed . in this work ,",
    "we adopt a simple non - relativistic model , i.e. the harmonic oscillator model @xcite .",
    "this model has been widely and successfully employed in similar researches @xcite .",
    "thus one can trust that for heavy hadrons , such simple non - relativistic model can work well and the results are relatively reliable , even though certain errors are not avoidable .",

    "however , for @xmath10 , fig.[sm](c ) does not contribute at all , so that the decay of @xmath10 into charmless final states ( or @xmath20 into bottomless final states ) is more appropriate for exploring new physics than @xmath123 .    it is worth noticing that the estimate of the contribution of the sm to the decay rate is very rough , thus what we can assure to ourselves is its order of magnitude . indeed",
    "the magnitude contributed by the sm is very small and can not produce sizable observational effects at all , even though it has a comparable order with that from the two sample models , the unparticle and @xmath1 . in the future ,",
    "if such mode were observed at lhcb , we can definitely conclude that it is not caused by the sm , but new physics .",
    "in this work , we propose to explore for new physics beyond the sm at lhcb by measuring direct decays of @xmath137 into charmless ( bottomless ) final states .",
    "such decays can occur via the diagrams shown in fig . 1 in the framework of the sm , but is much suppressed to be experimentally observed , therefore if a sizable rate is measured , it would be a clear signal for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "we use two models as examples , namely the unparticle and @xmath1 models to calculate the decay rates , because both of them allow a transition of @xmath138 where @xmath29 may be light quarks to occur at tree level .",
    "thus one expects that these new models might result in non - zero observation .",
    "indeed , our work is motivated by three factors , first the great machine lhc will run next year and a remarkable amount of data will be available , then secondly , the double - charmed baryon @xmath14 which was observed by the selex collaboration provides us a possibility to probe new physics , and the last reason is that some models have been proposed and they may induce a flavor - changing neutral current , concretely the unparticle and @xmath1 models are employed in this work .",
    "definitely none of the two models are confirmed by either theory or experiment yet , and they still need further theoretical investigations , but their framework is clear , so that we may use them as examples to demonstrate how new physics may cause such decay modes and indicate that a sizable observational rate is a clear signature for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "moreover , the double charmed baryon has only been observed by the selex collaboration , but not at b - factories .",
    "it seems peculiar at first glimpse , but careful studies indicate that it is quite reasonable due to the fragmentation process of heavy quarks .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite indicate that the meson @xmath139 can not be seen at any @xmath140 colliders because its production rate at such machines is too small , but by contraries , its production rate is greatly enhanced at hadron colliders .",
    "it was first observed at tevatron and its production rate at lhc would be much larger by several orders @xcite . in analog",
    ", one can expect that such double - charmed baryons @xmath14 or double - bottomed @xmath15 can only be produced at lhc , but not at b - factories .",
    "the inclusive decays of doubly charmed baryons @xmath39 , @xmath10 and @xmath141 , @xmath20 are explored in unparticle and @xmath1 scenarios .",
    "our result indicates that the upper limit of the inclusive decay width of @xmath142 is about @xmath143 gev with @xmath110 . for inclusive decay @xmath109 ,",
    "the upper limit is at order of @xmath144 gev .",
    "it is learnt that in the unparticle scenario , the contribution from exchanging a vector unparticle is much larger than that from exchanging a scalar unparticle , as shown in table [ typical ] .",
    "the parameters which we employ in the numerical computations are obtained by fitting other experimental measurements , for example if the recently observed @xmath145 can be interpreted by the unparticle model , an upper bound on the parameters in the model would be constrained .",
    "indeed , all the present experimental data can only provide upper bounds on the model parameters no matter what new physics model under consideration is .",
    "so far it is hard to make an accurate estimate on the production rates of the heavy baryons which contain two heavy quarks at lhc yet , but one has reason to believe that the production rate would be roughly of the same order of the production rate of @xmath139 which was evaluated by some authors @xcite , or even smaller by a factor of less than 10 .",
    "the production rates indeed will be theoretically evaluated before or even after lhc begins running .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors estimate the number of @xmath14 produced at lhcb as about @xmath146 .",
    "since the available energy is much higher than the masses of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , one has strong reason to believe that their production rates are comparable .",

    "even though the two sample models and sm can not cause sufficiently large rates , the channels still may stand for a possible place to search for new physics .",
