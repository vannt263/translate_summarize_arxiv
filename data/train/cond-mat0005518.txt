    "when a fluid mixture is suddenly quenched from a disordered initial condition to a coexistence state below the critical temperature , the two fluids segregate with domains growing with time ( see , e.g. , gunton _",
    "et al . _ 1983 ) .",
    "the morphology of these domains is strongly influenced by an applied flow . in the case of a shear flow ( for a review",
    "see onuki 1997 ) , the domains are observed to grow greatly elongated in the flow direction ( see , e.g. , hashimoto _ et al .",
    "the effects of the shear have been considerably investigated in the last years .",
    "several numerical simulations confirm the anisotropic growth of the domains ( ohta _ et al .",

    "new recent theoretical results by corberi _",
    "( 1998)-(1999 ) show that , as an effect of the shear , the mixture contains domains of two different thicknesses and that the relative abundance of these domains changes periodically with the logarithm of time .",
    "however in the papers of corberi _ et al . _",
    "( 1998)-(1999 ) phase separation occurred only for the effects of simple diffusion .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to see how the hydrodynamics affects this picture .",
    "the presence of domains with different scales is a very peculiar result for phase separating mixtures .",
    "indeed , in the general picture for the unsheared case , a single time - dependent length scale @xmath3 , which measures the typical size of domains , characterizes the behaviour of the mixture ( see bray 1994 ) .",
    "this length grows with the power law @xmath4 , where the value of the growth exponent @xmath5 is strictly related to the physical mechanism operating in the segregation process .",
    "for example @xmath6 in a pure diffusive regime .",
    "therefore the existence of two characteristic scales makes the phase separation process very interesting from a theoretical point of view and also with relevant practical implications .",
    "looking at the effects of hydrodynamics on this problem is not a simple computational task .",
    "domains grow fast in the direction of the flow making finite - size effects quite soon relevant in simulations ( for a recent review , see , yeomans 1999 ) . in this paper",
    "we use a lattice boltzmann scheme ( orlandini _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , swift _",
    "1996 ) to simulate the convection - diffusion and navier - stokes equations for a binary mixture .",
    "this method has been found very convenient with respect to other numerical algorithms for fluid mixtures",
    "( chen & doolen 1998 ) since it allows to reach very large time scales .",
    "in particular , an advantage of the lattice boltzmann scheme of orlandini _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) and swift _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) , is that the correct fluid equilibrium can be imposed by choosing an appropriate free energy .",
    "moreover , differently from other lattice gas methods , it allows to control in a separate way the different mechanisms of transport tuning independently the fluid viscosity and the diffusivity .",
    "the mentioned lattice boltmann scheme has been used with success in several problems of phase separation of binary fluid mixtures without shear in two ( osborn _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) and three dimensions ( kendon _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , and also in the case of complex fluids ( gonnella _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .",
    "a preliminary important part of our work has been to include proper boundary conditions for a shear flow in lattice boltzmann schemes .",
    "this problem , considered also by wagner & yeomans ( 1998 ) and cates _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) , has been studied in many papers on lattice boltzmann schemes for a single fluid ( for a review , see , e. g. , chen & doolen 1998 ) .",
    "we discuss previous procedures and propose an improved algorithm which allows to strictly conserve mass and momentum on the boundary walls without introducing slip velocities .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the fluid model and the lattice boltzmann scheme . in section 3",
    "we describe and compare different approaches for implementing shear boundary conditions in the numerical scheme . in section 4",

    "the initial value of @xmath8 corresponds to a symmetric 50:50 mixture with the two fluids completely mixed .",
    "these quantities are locally conserved in any collision process and , therefore , we require that the local equilibrium distribution functions fulfil the equations @xmath56 following orlandini _ et al . _",

    "the next step in implementing the algorithm is to apply a shear flow on the system .",
    "we have modified previous lattice boltzmann schemes for a single fluid where sliding walls moving in a lattice direction were used to enforce the fluid a given velocity .",
    "the flow is assumed to be directed along the @xmath74-axis ( horizontal on the lattice ) . in this direction",
    "we considered periodic boundary conditions .",
    "then departing distribution functions on outward - pointing links re - enter the lattice via corresponding inward - pointing links on the opposite boundary with no constraint on the macroscopic velocity or density .",
    "the walls are on the top and the bottom of the lattice .",
    "here one has to face two problems : the correct value of the velocity has to be imposed to the fluid , and the distribution functions pointing outward have to be managed in such a way that mass conservation for both components and momentum conservation for the bulk are always guaranteed . in the following",
    "we discuss two possible ways for introducing the sliding walls . with the point at @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the shear rate .",
    "lattice boltzmann implementation of lees - edwards boundary conditions requires also to change the usual definition of the local equilibrium distribution functions so that we have preferred to use the more straightforward approach with the sliding walls . ]    _ equilibrium scheme .",
    "_ in the first scheme that we have considered , the boundary walls are placed on the links beyond the upper and the lower sites at a distance equal to half lattice spacing , in the spirit of some works on shear boundary conditions in lattice boltzmann methods for one fluid ( cornubert _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 , ladd 1994 ) .",
    "we assign to the local equilibrium distributions at the top ( t ) and the bottom ( b ) of the lattice the values corresponding to the velocities @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , being @xmath81 the distance between the top and the bottom of the lattice ( he _ et al .",
    "this method is expected to be accurate for relaxation parameters near unity , since when @xmath82 the collision process ( see equation ( [ coll ] ) ) simply replaces the distribution function with the local equilibrium value . for describing the propagation step",
    "let us refer to the upper row and to the @xmath83 s .",
    "after a collision , for each site of the upper row , there are three distributions @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 pointing outward the system . the propagation is implemented with the following scheme : @xmath87 this choice can be justified considering reflection of particles against the boundary wall .",
    "this allows to guarantee the conservation of mass and momentum , that on each site 9 distribution functions are still defined , and that propagation between adjacent sites on the boundary occurs simultaneously to the propagation on all the inner sites , since @xmath84 and @xmath86 are propagated over a distance @xmath88 in a time step and @xmath85 over a distance equal to one .",
    "this method , however , as expected and also shown in the following , does not work well for arbitrary values of the relaxation parameters .",
    "therefore we heve developed a second way for introducing the sliding walls .",

    "the collision step is applied to all sites , including the boundary ones .",
    "unfortunately this scheme does not allow to conserve exactly the total mass due to the fact that the distribution functions @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 resulting from the collision step are not accounted for any more , and this avoids the exact mass conservation ( zou & he 1997 ) .    we have improved the above scheme in order to overcome the mass conservation problem .",
    "we consider again the propagation step and the problem of calculating the unknown quantities @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "after the propagation step on each upper site one has the distribution functions @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 coming from the nearest sites , @xmath101 , which does not propagate , and @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , all referred to the previous time step , which were lost in the version of zou & he ( 1997 ) .",

    "once the system has been initialized , the application of the propagation and collision steps goes on preserving mass and momentum conservation and implementing the correct velocity values on the boundaries , as it has also been verified numerically .",
    "_ comparison between the two schemes_. here we compare the validity of the two schemes .",
    "we have studied how the steady state velocity profile is reached and we have measured the slip velocity .",
    "the shear is applied as usual from the beginning of the phase separation .",
    "preliminarly we have checked that the boundary conditions do not introduce any artificial discontinuity on the walls .",
    "therefore we have considered the behaviour of the densities @xmath21 and @xmath8 along vertical sections normal to the flow direction . in figure 2 ( a)-(b ) the plots of @xmath21 and @xmath8 , for the middle section of the system , are showed for the collisional scheme .",
    "it can be seen that the total density @xmath21 stays constant and equal to 1 all over the system ( its deviations from 1 are less than @xmath110 ) and no boundary effects can be observed .",
    "the profile of @xmath8 , with the fluctuations corresponding to the presence of interfaces , does not show anything pathological , too .",
    "similar results have been obtained with the equilibrium scheme . in figure 3",
    "we show at consecutive times the @xmath74-component of the fluid velocity along a vertical line in the middle of the system calculated with the collisional scheme .",
    "the velocity profiles are independent on the particular vertical section considered .",
    "the steady velocity profile is the planar couette flow ( landau & lifshitz 1959 ) with the @xmath74-component of the velocity having a linear dependence on the @xmath111 coordinate .",
    "the evolution of the velocity profile in figure 3 is very similar to that observed in simple fluids ( schlichting 1979 , p. 92 ) . the same evolution is obtained with the equilibrium scheme when @xmath112 .",
    "the situation is different for larger values of @xmath48 , when , with the first scheme , the time needed to reach the steady velocity profile is much longer .",
    "actually , it happens that for large enough values of @xmath48 the linear profile is not reached before finite - size effects become relevant in the simulations .",
    "this can be understood from equation ( [ coll ] ) . indeed , if @xmath113 , @xmath114 takes more time to reach the local equilibrium value @xmath115 which contains the information about the velocity of walls .",
    "a measure of the time @xmath116 required to reach the steady state velocity profile can be done in this way .",
    "we say that the steady state is reached if @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a tolerance set to @xmath119 . in figure 4",
    "we show the results obtained with the collisional scheme .",
    "the time @xmath116 required to reach the steady state decreases at increasing values of @xmath48 .",
    "the analytic solution of the navier - stokes equation for a single fluid subject to a couette flow suggests a similar behaviour . for a single fluid",
    "it can be shown that the non - stationary part of the velocity profile behaves as a series of exponential terms @xmath120 with @xmath121 an integer ( schlichting 1979 ) .",
    "for this reason we have reported our results in a log - log scale , even if in this plot we do not observe a linear behaviour .",
    "next we consider the behaviour of the slip velocity .",
    "it is defined as the difference between the wall velocity and the fluid velocity along the wall itself and should be negligible .",
    "the slip velocity can be measured by the maximum relative error . at the top boundary",
    "it can be calculated as @xmath122 where again @xmath123 is the fluid velocity at the @xmath124-th site along the @xmath74 direction at the top boundary and @xmath125 is the wall velocity .",
    "the results of this measure for different values of @xmath48 and for both schemes are presented in figure 5 . for the collisional scheme @xmath126 over the explored range",
    "@xmath127 $ ] of values of @xmath48 ( figure 5 ( a ) ) . in the equilibrium scheme",
    "@xmath128 has a minimum value at @xmath82 and then increases with @xmath48 ( figure 5 ( b ) ) arriving to values of order 0.3 .",
    "the conclusion is that the first scheme gives less convincing results and we have preferred to use the collisional scheme to run our simulations on phase separation .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of phase separation on systems with size @xmath129 , using the values written in section 2 for the parameters of the model and varying @xmath76 in the range @xmath130 $ ] and @xmath48 in @xmath131 $ ] , being mainly interested in the hydrodynamic regime at low viscosity .    here",
    "we report the results obtained for @xmath132 , which corresponds to a viscosity @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .",
    "similar results have been obtained for other values of parameters .",
    "a sequence of configurations at different values of the shear strain @xmath135 is shown in the left column of figure 6 .",
    "the first step of the time evolution is the formation of well defined interfaces .",
    "then , for a while , domains grow isotropically as in the case without shear . at @xmath136 , for example , the effects of the shear can be observed only near the moving walls due to the fact that at this time the linear profile of the velocity is not yet reached and the velocity is greater close to the walls ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the deformation induced by the flow can be observed everywhere in the system starting from values @xmath137 .",
    "later on the domains become very stretched and progressively aligned with the flow direction as it can be clearly seen at @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "it is also clear , by looking at these two configurations , that the system shows inhomogeneities and in particular domains with different thicknesses .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the length scales present in the system can be done by considering the behaviour of the structure factor @xmath140 .",
    "this quantity is the one of experimental interest being accessible through scattering techniques .",
    "it corresponds to the fourier transform of the two - points correlation function and can be computed numerically as @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the fourier transform of the order parameter @xmath143 and @xmath144 refers to an average over an ensemble of different initial realizations of the system .",
    "the wave vector @xmath145 in the reciprocal lattice is given by @xmath146 , where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are two unit vectors in the @xmath149 and @xmath150 directions , respectively , and @xmath151 and @xmath152 range from @xmath153 to @xmath154 .",
    "it could be useful to remind the behaviour of @xmath140 in the case without shear .",
    "its shape is that of a volcano with a contour plot similar to that shown in figure 6 at @xmath155 .",
    "the radius of the volcano defines the inverse of a characteristic length representing the average size of domains at a given time .",
    "as time goes by , the height of this volcano increases while its support shrinks towards the origin .",
    "this means that the characteristic length scale associated with the size of domains increases and the system is more and more ordered on that scale .",
    "the fact that the structure factor is circular reflects the isotropy of the system .    the shear affects in a significative way the evolution of the structure factor . at @xmath156",
    "the shape of the volcano is deformed into an elliptical structure as it can be seen in the contour plot of figure 6 .",
    "moreover also the profile of the edge of the volcano is deformed and two maxima can be observed distributed around the main diagonal of the @xmath157 plane . in the further evolution",
    "the two broad maxima at @xmath156 become divided into two separate foils and on each foil two different peaks can be observed .",
    "this can be clearly seen at @xmath158 .",
    "these two foils becomes closer and closer to the axis @xmath159 and increasingly more aligned along the @xmath150 axis .",
    "this pattern corresponds to interfaces very elongated in the direction of the flow as it appears in the corresponding pictures of configurations .",
    "the presence of two peaks on each foil implies the existence of different length scales in the systems . due to the symmetry @xmath160 the two foils are perfectly symmetric and it is sufficient to consider only the two peaks of one foil . therefore for each direction there are two relevant length scales .",
    "focussing on what happens in the direction normal to the flow we arrive to the conclusion that there are domains with two characteristic thicknesses in the system .",
    "this better explains the inhomogeneities observed in the configurations at @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "also the dynamical evolution of the 4-peaked structure factor is very peculiar . at @xmath161",
    "the peaks which prevail are the ones with a larger value of @xmath150 .",
    "this corresponds to a prevalence of thin domains in the system , as it can perhaps be observed by directly looking at the corresponding configuration .",
    "later on the more isotropic peak with the smaller value of @xmath150 , which has grown faster than the other , becomes higher .",
    "this can be observed in figure 6 at @xmath162 in correspondence of a larger abundance of thicker domains .",
    "the physical picture of what happens in the system is the following . by stretching the interfaces the shear induces a stress in the system .",
    "this stress increases more and more producing a prevalence of thin domains . at a certain point",
    "the domains are broken by the flow in points where the stress is larger .",
    "this occurs in a cooperative way with a sequence of ruptures producing domains which are less stretched .",
    "then the thicker domains , not yet broken by the flow , become more numerous and the more isotropic peak of @xmath140 dominates as at @xmath162 .",
    "it was not possible to follow longer in our simulations the alternate predominance of the two peaks due to inevitable appearance of finite - size effects .",
    "previous analytical results of corberi _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) show that in the diffusive regime the alternate prevalence of the two peaks continues periodically on a logarithmic time scale",
    ". we can not give results on this .",
    "here we mention that in experiments with polymer solutions by migler _",
    "( 1996 ) , after a shallow quench under the critical temperature , segregation is observed with 4-peaked structure factors similar to those of figure 6 .",
    "moreover , in previous experimental papers by laufer _",

    "( 1991)-(1992 ) always on polymer solutions , the description of the dynamics of the network of domains is similar to that given above .",
    "we believe that our simulations , where for the first time the presence of two length scales is considered , help to understand these experimental facts .",
    "we conclude this section giving the results of an explicit evaluation of the size of the domains .",
    "this measure is usually obtained from the momenta of the structure factor . since",
    "our system is anisotropic we define the average size of domains in the flow direction as @xmath163 and analogously for @xmath164 , in the shear direction normal to the flow .",
    "they are one half of the wave length corresponding to the characteristic wave vector . in the case without shear lattice boltzmann simulations with our parameters give @xmath165 ( osborn _ et al .",
    "@xmath166 is the value of the growth exponent typical of the inertial regime which occurs at very low viscosity ( furukawa 1985 ) . from our simulations we extract the behaviour shown in figure 7 .",
    "as in all the other simulations with a shear flow ( yeomans 1999 ) , it has not been possible to extract the value of the exponent @xmath5 due to the relevance of finite - size effects .",
    "is only available for the diffusive regime ( corberi _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) , rapapa & bray ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "it is found that @xmath167 in the flow direction , and @xmath6 in the other directions as in the case without shear . ] using an argument proposed by corberi _",
    "( 1999 ) , based on a renormalization group approach ( bray 1990 ) , one should expect in the present case , if dynamical scaling for the structure factor holds , that the growth in the shear direction obeys the same power law as in the case without shear , @xmath168 , while in the @xmath74-direction @xmath169 .",
    "this means that the growth exponent @xmath170 in the flow direction is related to @xmath171 , the growth exponent in the shear direction , by the relation @xmath172 , where the extra contribution @xmath173 with respect to the unsheared case comes from the convective term in the convection - diffusion equation ( [ conv1 ] ) .",
    "our runs , performed on an alpha workstation xp1000 with 1 gb of ram , do not allow to check these predictions .",
    "the results of figure 7 can be more easily related to the above discussed dynamical behaviour of the structure factor with the alternate dominance of the two peaks which corresponds to the oscillatory pattern of @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "we also observe that these oscillations make more difficult a possible evaluation of the growth exponents .",
    "we studied phase separation in sheared binary fluid mixtures at low viscosity .",
    "we introduced proper boundary conditions to impose the shear flow on the system .",
    "these boundary conditions strictly conserve mass and momentum and do not introduce any appreciable slip velocity .",
    "our main results show that the network of domains is characterized by the existence of two typical length scales for each direction .",
    "indeed , domains with different thickness are clearly visible in the simulations .",
    "structure factors with four peaks confirm these observations . during the time evolution",
    "there is an alternate dominance of two of these peaks over the other couple .",
    "this corresponds to a larger abundance first of thin and later of thicker domains .",
    "simulations on much larger scales are needed to establish if the oscillations of the peaks only characterize an initial transient or if they continue indefinitely , as it is suggested by the results of corberi _ et al . _",
