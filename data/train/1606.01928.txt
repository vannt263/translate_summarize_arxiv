    "difference equations can describe population dynamics models , and , if there is no compensation for low population size , i.e. the stock recruitment is lower than mortality , the species goes to extinction , unless the initial size is large enough .",
    "this phenomenon was introduced in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "it is called the allee effect after @xcite and can be explained by many factors : problems with finding a mate , deficiency of group defense or / and social functioning for low population densities . if the initial population size is small enough ( is in the allee zone ) then the population size tends to zero as the time grows and tends to infinity .",
    "even a small stochastic perturbation which does not tend to zero , significantly changes the situation : due to random immigration , there are large enough values of the population size for some large times even in the allee zone , due to this occasional immigration .",
    "thus , instead of extinction , we explore eventual low - density behavior , as well as essential persistence and solution bounds .",
    "results on permanence of solutions for stochastic difference equations , including boundedness and persistence , were recently reviewed in @xcite . for recent results on asymptotic behavior of stochastic difference equations also see @xcite and the whole issue of journal of difference equations and applications including @xcite .",
    "the influence of stochastic perturbations on population survival , chaos control and eventual cyclic behavior was investigated in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the chaotic behavior could be destroyed by either a positive deterministic @xcite or stochastic noise with a positive mean @xcite ; instead of chaos , there is an attractive two - cycle .",
    "certainly , stochastic perturbations , applied formally , can lead to negative size values .",
    "to avoid this situation , we consider the truncated stochastic difference equation @xmath11 here @xmath12 is a function with a possible allee zone , for example , @xmath13 described in @xcite and @xmath14 considered in @xcite ; see @xcite for the detailed outline of models of the allee effect .",
    "it is well known that , without a stochastic perturbation , if @xmath15 is a function such that @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 , the eventual behavior of a solution depends on the initial condition : if @xmath20 , then the solution tends to zero ( goes to extinction ) , if @xmath21 then the solution satisfies @xmath22 , i.e. persists .",
    "sometimes high densities also lead to extinction , as in and , we can only claim that @xmath18 for @xmath23 and conclude persistence for @xmath24 .",
    "however , the situation changes for with a stochastic perturbation : for example , even if @xmath12 has an allee zone , the eventual expectation of a solution exceeds a positive number depending on @xmath3 and the distribution of @xmath25 . nevertheless , this effect is due to immigration only , and we will call this type of behavior blurred extinction , or eventual low density . in the present paper ,",
    "we use some ideas developed in @xcite for models with a randomly switching perturbation .",
    "significant interest to discrete maps is stimulated by complicated types of behavior exhibited even by simple maps .",
    "in particular , for with @xmath26 large enough , whatever a positive initial value is , the chaotic solution can take values in the interval @xmath27 for any small @xmath28 .",
    "then , in practical applications the dynamics is not in fact chaotic but leads to eventual extinction as the positive density can not be arbitrarily low .",
    "nevertheless , if the range is separated from zero , for some maps there is an unconditional survival ( persistence ) , independently of a positive initial value .    in this note , we are mostly interested in the maps @xmath12 with survival for certain initial values and an allee zone : if @xmath29 is small enough , then the solution of with @xmath30 tends to zero , and there is an interval @xmath31 \\subset ( 0,\\infty)$ ] which @xmath12 maps into itself .",
    "the main results of the paper are the following :    1 .",
    "if in the value of @xmath3 is small enough , the dynamics is similar to the non - stochastic case : blurred extinction ( low density ) for small @xmath29 and persistence for @xmath29 in a certain interval .",
    "if @xmath32 is large enough then , under some additional assumptions , there is an unconditional survival .",
    "3 .   if the non - perturbed system has several attraction zones then for any initial condition , the solution can become persistent with large enough lower bound , whenever @xmath3 is large enough .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after describing all relevant assumptions and notations in section  [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we state that for perturbations small enough , there is the same allee effect as in the deterministic case , in section  [ sec : per ] .",
    "the result that there may exist large enough perturbation amplitudes ensuring survival for any positive initial condition , is also included in section  [ sec : per ] .",
    "further , section  [ sec4 ] deals with the case when , for certain initial conditions , both persistence and low - density behavior are possible , with a positive probability , while for other initial conditions , a.s .",
    "persistence or a.s .",
    "low - density behavior is guaranteed . for initial values leading to different types of dynamics , lower bounds for probabilities of each types of dynamics",
    "are developed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
