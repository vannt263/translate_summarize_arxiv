    "in addition , for massive photon there is no vanishing denominator for fig .",

    "therefore , at this order , in both lf and feynman gauge , there is only one diagram that can give ir divergences . in coherent state basis",
    ", there are additional contributions in addition to those already discussed for fock basis . in particular , in @xmath47 , one can also get a contribution from diagrams in fig .",

    ". the second limit @xmath76 and the double limit @xmath77 do not give any ir divergences here .",
    "5 represents the complete set of additional diagrams in coherent state basis at @xmath78 .",
    "in equal time formulation of qed , it has been shown using coherent states method that the ir divergences cancel to all orders . in qcd",
    "such a proof does not exist .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that in qcd , the asymptotic states are bound states .",
    "so the asymptotic hamiltonian obtained by kf method is not sufficient for the cancellation of ir divergences .",
    "a new approach to the asymptotic dynamics has been proposed called the `` improved method of asymptotic dynamics '' , based on a proposal by mcmullan etal @xcite , that the kf method makes no connection between large time limit and the separation of particles at large distances . in particular",
    ", they showed that the kf method does not lead to correct result for @xmath79 theory , and pointed out that it is more appropriate in qft to work at the level of matrix elements than at the level of operators . based on this observation",
    "they proposed a new improved method of asymptotic dynamics which is based on the asymptotic properties of matrix elements instead of operators and which also takes into account appropriate boundary conditions corresponding to the separation of particles at large distances .",
    "the key observation is that the matrix element @xcite @xmath80 is a time dependent complex number and , therefore , to investigate its asymptotic limit , one can use the method of stationary phase .",
    "thus , if the above matrix element is given by + @xmath81\\ ] ] then , according to the method of stationary phase , this integral approaches zero as @xmath82 provided there is no point in the region of integration at which all first order partial derivatives of @xmath83 vanish .",
    "the second criteria they suggest is to take into account the binding of particles at asymptotic limit .",
    "+ in lfqed , @xmath84 the asymptotic region according to the kf method is given by @xmath85 , whereas in the improved method , the asymptotic region is defined by the following conditions , @xmath86    we have verified that for qed both the methods give the same asymptotic conditions but in case of theories with 4@xmath27point coupling the asymptotic regions obtained by kf method and the first criteria of improved method do not match .",
    "we have shown that the true ir divergences get cancelled when coherent state basis is used to calculate the matrix elements in lepton self - energy correction in light - front qed up to @xmath1 in lf gauge as well as in feynman gauge . the cancellation of ir divergences between real and virtual processes is known to hold in equal time qed to all orders .",
    "it would be interesting to verify this all order cancellation in lfqed .",
    "the present work is an initial step in this direction .",
    "it is well known that ir divergences do not cancel in qcd in higher orders .",
    "this is related to the fact that the asymptotic states are bound states .",
    "connection between asymptotic dynamics and ir divergences can possibly be exploited to construct an artificial potential that may be used in bound state calculations in lfqcd .",
