    "the advent of the lhc era has led to renewed interest in extensions of the standard model which have a strongly - coupled symmetry - breaking ( higgs ) sector .",
    "the most promising of these theories are the so - called technicolor theories @xcite . these are qcd - like theories with massless fermions ( techni - quarks ) in which the goldstone bosons of spontaneously - broken chiral symmetry ( techi - pions ) play the rle of the higgs field , giving masses to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "such models need to be extended in order to also give masses to the quarks and leptons .",
    "phenomenological difficulties with such models , such as flavour - changing neutral currents which are too large , can be avoided if the fermion content of a candidate ( extended ) technicolor theory is such that the running gauge coupling constant evolves very slowly .",
    "such theories are referred to as walking technicolor models @xcite .",
    "let us consider a yang - mills gauge theory with @xmath6 fermions in a specified ( not - too - large ) representation of the `` colour '' group .",
    "the evolution of the coupling constant @xmath7 in such a theory is described by the callan - symanzik beta function @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the momentum scale at which the running coupling constant @xmath11 is defined .",
    "@xmath12,@xmath13 , ... are given by perturbation theory .",
    "for @xmath6 sufficiently small , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are both positive , the theory is asymptotically free and confining , and chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken",
    ". there exists some value of @xmath6 above which @xmath12 ( and @xmath13 ) are negative and asymptotic freedom is lost . between these two regimes",
    "is a range of @xmath6 over which @xmath12 is positive and @xmath13 is negative . in this range",
    "the theory remains asymptotically free , but if this 2-loop beta function describes the physics , it has a second zero which is an infrared ( ir ) fixed point and the theory is a conformal ( unparticle ) field theory .",
    "there is , however , another possibility . if the coupling becomes strong enough that a chiral condensate forms before this would - be ir fixed point can be reached , the fermions will become less effective at screening technicolor .",
    "@xmath14 will then start to decrease again , and the theory will be confining in the infrared .",
    "there will , however , be a range of @xmath10 over which @xmath14 is small and @xmath7 evolves only slowly , i.e. it walks .",
    "since the formation of a chiral condensate which spontaneously breaks chiral symmetry is a non - perturbative process , the boundary between conformal and walking behaviour can not be determined perturbatively .",
    "lattice gauge theory simulations can enable one to decide between these two options for a theory with a specified gauge group , fermion technicolor representation and @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath15 gauge theories , the most promising candidates for walking behaviour have fermions in the fundamental , adjoint , symmetric 2-index tensor or antisymmetric 2-index tensor representations of the gauge group .",
    "a good summary of what is known is given in reference @xcite .",
    "estimates of the value of @xmath6 below which a gauge theory walks and above which it is conformal have been made using various methods , none of which can be guaranteed to capture the full non - perturbative behaviour of qcd - like theories @xcite .",
    "this has led people to use lattice gauge theory simulations to study this boundary .",
    "there have been a number of simulations of qcd with @xmath6 fundamental quarks , with @xmath6 large enough that conformal or walking behaviour might be expected @xcite .",
    "while progress has been made , the boundary value for @xmath6 is still uncertain .",
    "some simulations have been made of @xmath16 gauge theory with 2 dirac flavours of adjoint fermions @xcite .",
    "while early indications are that this is a conformal field theory , there is still a great deal of uncertainty .    for qcd with colour - sextet ( symmetric tensor ) quarks ,",
    "@xmath13 changes sign at @xmath17 , and asymptotic freedom is lost at @xmath18 .",
    "hence only @xmath19 and @xmath20 lie in the domain of interest .",
    "@xmath20 is just below the value where asymptotic freedom is lost and is thus expected to be conformal .",
    "this leaves @xmath19 as the most likely candidate for walking behaviour .",
    "degrand , shamir and svetitsky have simulated lattice qcd with 2 flavours of colour - sextet wilson quarks @xcite .",
    "their initial results suggest that this is a conformal field theory .",
    "fodor et al . have performed some preliminary simulations of lattice qcd with 2 sextet quarks using domain - wall quarks @xcite .",
    "we are performing simulations of lattice qcd with 2 colour - sextet staggered quarks .",
    "staggered quarks have the advantage over wilson quarks in having a simple chiral order parameter , and no parameter tuning is needed to find the chiral limit .",
    "we are performing simulations at finite temperatures , where the deconfinement and chiral - symmetry restoration temperatures can be used as measures of the scales of confinement and chiral - symmetry breaking respectively . by varying the number of time slices @xmath21",
    "we can determine whether these transitions scale as finite temperature transitions or whether they are bulk transitions .",
    "preliminary results of these simulations were presented at lattice 2009 @xcite .",
    "our simulations indicate that , whereas for fundamental quarks the deconfinement and chiral - symmetry restoration transitions appear coincident , for colour - sextet quarks these transitions are well separated .",
    "chiral - symmetry restoration occurs at a much weaker coupling than deconfinement .",
    "this differs from what is seen with wilson quarks by degrand , shamir and svetitsky @xcite where the two transitions appear coincident .",
    "such a separation has been reported in earlier simulations with colour - adjoint quarks @xcite , and in @xmath16 gauge theory with colour - adjoint quarks @xcite .",
    "both transitions move to significantly weaker couplings when @xmath21 is increased from @xmath22 to @xmath1 , which is what would be expected for finite temperature transitions governed by asymptotic freedom .",
    "this in turn favours the walking scenario .    in the deconfined region , just above the deconfinement transition , we find 3 states , where the wilson line ( polyakov loop ) is oriented in the directions of the 3 cube roots of unity , similar to what occurs for quenched qcd or qcd with adjoint quarks .",
    "for @xmath0 only the state with a real positive polyakov loop appears stable .",
    "the other two states , while long - lived , appear to be only metastable . for @xmath3 , all 3 states appear to be stable . between the deconfinement and chiral - symmetry restoration transitions there is another transition where the 2 states with complex polyakov loops disorder into a state with a real , negative polyakov loop .",
    "machtey and svetitsky have argued that such additional states where the polyakov loop has arguments @xmath23 and @xmath24 are to be expected , and have presented evidence for their existence and metastability in simulations using wilson quarks @xcite .    in section  2",
    "we discuss our simulations .",
    "our results are described in section  3 .",
    "section  4 presents discussions and conclusions and identifies directions for ongoing and future investigation .",

    "we perform simulations on @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 lattices , over a range of values of @xmath2 which covers all transitions . for each lattice size",
    "we perform runs at quark mass @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 in lattice units , to allow us to access the chiral limit .",
    "away from the transitions our run lengths are typically 10,000 length-1 trajectories for a given @xmath36 and @xmath14 . near deconfinement transitions",
    "run lengths of 50,000 to 200,000 trajectories are used for each @xmath14 and @xmath36 .",
    "some runs of 50,000 trajectories have also been used near the transitions from negative polyakov loop states to complex polyakov loop states .",
    "we create deconfined states with positive polyakov loops by starting a run at @xmath37 ( weak coupling ) from a completely ordered state ( all @xmath38s equal to the identity matrix ) .",
    "the configurations from these runs are used to start runs at progressively smaller @xmath14s ( and masses ) .",
    "the states with negative polyakov loops are obtained by starting a run at @xmath37 with all @xmath38s equal to the identity matrix , except for the timelike @xmath38s on a single time slice , which are set to the matrix @xmath39 .",
    "the triplet wilson line ( polyakov loop ) is used to identify the position of the deconfinement transition .",
    "the chiral - symmetry restoring phase transition occurs at that @xmath14 above which the chiral condensate ( @xmath40 ) vanishes in the chiral ( @xmath41 ) limit .",
    "since the chiral extrapolation is difficult to perform with the masses we use , we estimate the position of the chiral transition from the positions of the peaks in the chiral susceptibilities @xmath42 as functions of mass .",
    "@xmath43 \\label{eqn : chi}\\ ] ] where the @xmath44s in this formula are lattice averaged quantities and @xmath45 is the space - time volume of the lattice .",
    "since we use stochastic estimators for @xmath44 , we obtain an unbiased estimator for this quantity by using several independent estimates for each configuration ( 5 , in fact ) .",
    "our estimate of @xmath46 is then given by the average of the ( 10 ) estimates which are ` off diagonal ' in the noise .",
    "we perform simulations at a selection of @xmath14 values in the range @xmath47 on @xmath30 and @xmath31 lattices . for each of the 3 chosen masses ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) the values of the wilson line and chiral condensate on the @xmath30 and @xmath31 lattices are so close that we conclude that finite size effects are negligible .",
    "figure  [ fig : wil - psi_12x4 ] shows the wilson line and chiral condensates    as functions of @xmath14 for each of the 3 masses ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) on a @xmath31 lattice . in the deconfined phase ,",
    "we have included only those states where the wilson line is real and positive , noting that runs which start in a state with a positive wilson line remain in this state for the duration of the run .",
    "we have not included the results for the @xmath51 lattice , since at the resolution of figure  [ fig : wil - psi_12x4 ] the points for the 2 lattice sizes would be virtually indistinguishable .",
    "it is clear that the wilson line is very small below @xmath52 , and rises rapidly shortly after this value for all 3 quark masses .",
    "this is taken as a signal for the deconfinement transition .",
    "it is also clear that chiral symmetry remains broken well beyond this point .",
    "thus the deconfinement and chiral - symmetry restoration transitions are far apart , unlike what is observed for wilson quarks , where they appear to be coincident @xcite .    = 5.0 in    figure",
    "[ fig : wilhist-5.42 ] shows a histogram of the wilson line at @xmath53 , @xmath35 , showing a clear two - state signal , suggesting that this @xmath14 is very close to the transition .",
    "the separation of the two states suggests that this transition is a first - order phase transition .",
    "we conclude that at @xmath35 the deconfinement transition is at @xmath54 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "two - state signals are seen at @xmath55 and @xmath56 leading to an estimate @xmath57 .",
    "finally we note that for @xmath33 , @xmath58 appears to lie below the transition while @xmath59 appears to be above the transition leading to an estimate @xmath60 .",
    "thus the mass dependence of the deconfinement @xmath14 , @xmath61 , is very weak .",
    "now let us turn to the chiral transition . because this is only expected to be a phase transition at @xmath62 , and the crossover becomes smoother as the quark mass",
    "is increased , it is difficult to determine its position directly from the chiral condensate at the masses we use .",
    "this is made more difficult since it is clear from the measured condensates as functions of mass , that the mass dependence is far from linear , making it extrapolating to @xmath62 difficult if not impossible .",
    "we therefore use the peak in the chiral susceptibility defined in equation  [ eqn : chi ] as an estimate of the position of the crossover for finite mass .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : chi4 ] for the two smallest masses .",
    "= 5.0 in    from these graphs we estimate that the transition occurs at @xmath63 for both @xmath14s .",
    "we thus estimate that the phase transition at @xmath62 occurs at @xmath64 .",
    "note that the spacing of the @xmath14s in this range is too large to allow us to use ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting to determine the positions of these transitions with more resolution .",
    "( the distributions of values of the plaquette action for adjacent @xmath14s do not overlap in this region . )    at each of our two larger masses , we have performed a series of runs starting from @xmath37 with a negative wilson line . from @xmath37 down to @xmath65 , the wilson lines remain negative over the length of the 10,000 trajectory run for each @xmath66 .",
    "by @xmath67 , these states have transitioned to states in which the wilson line is oriented in the direction of one of the complex cube roots of unity .",
    "hence we deduce that there is a transition at @xmath68",
    ". more discussion of this transition is to be found in the @xmath3 subsection . on the @xmath31 lattice with @xmath35",
    "these states with complex wilson lines persist down to @xmath69 , and appear stable over at least 50,000 trajectories . for @xmath34",
    "these persist down to @xmath70 . for @xmath71 at @xmath35 or @xmath72 at @xmath34 but above the deconfinement transition , these states with complex wilson lines appear to be metastable and eventually decay into states with positive wilson lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : meta ] shows an example of such metastability in our @xmath31 simulations .",
    "as is to be expected , this metastability starts at larger @xmath14 values on an @xmath30 lattice .",
    "we have observed no cases where configurations with positive wilson lines evolve to configurations with complex wilson lines for @xmath14 values above the deconfinement transition .",
    "we perform simulations on a @xmath32 lattice at quark masses @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for values of @xmath2 in the range @xmath73 .",
    "we perform two series of runs starting at @xmath37 , for @xmath74 .",
    "the first starts with the wilson line real and positive , and the second with the wilson line negative .",
    "for the lowest quark mass @xmath33 we only perform one set of runs starting with a positive wilson line at @xmath37 .    above the deconfinement transition",
    "we again see a 3-state signal where the wilson lines orient themselves in the directions of one of the 3 cube roots of unity .",
    "a scatterplot showing such a 3-state signal is shown in figure  [ fig : z3]a . unlike the @xmath0 case , there is no sign of metastability and transitions between all 3 states are seen over the duration of our runs , up to @xmath14 values far enough above the deconfinement transition that the mean relaxation time between tunnelings exceeds the lengths of our runs ( 50,000 trajectories ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : z3]b shows an example of such tunnelings .",
    "thus to make meaningful measurements of the wilson line , we need to separate these 3 states .",
    "this we do by binning the wilson lines measured at the end of each trajectory according to their phase @xmath75 into bins @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 . to increase our statistics , we use symmetry to include the complex conjugates of the wilson lines in the first of these bins , with the wilson lines in the last of these bins .",
    "other observables are binned according to the values of the corresponding wilson lines .",
    "= 4.0 in = 4.0 in    figure  [ fig : wil - psi_4x6]a shows the wilson lines ( polyakov loops ) and chiral condensates as functions of @xmath14 for all 3 masses from our simulations on a @xmath32 lattice for the states with positive wilson lines ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : wil - psi_4x6]b shows the magnitudes of the average wilson lines and the chiral condensates for the states with complex or negative wilson lines .",
    "the deconfinement transition manifests itself as a rapid increase in the wilson line , which is clearly seen at a @xmath14 just above @xmath79 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath80 centre symmetry is broken manifests itself in the difference between the magnitudes of the wilson lines in the positive wilson line and complex wilson line states .",
    "the rapid change in the magnitude of the complex / negative wilson line between @xmath81 and @xmath82 marks the transition between a state whose wilson line is oriented in the direction of one of the complex cube roots of unity and one where the wilson line is real and negative .",
    "the chiral transition , above which @xmath40 vanishes in the chiral ( @xmath41 ) limit , clearly occurs at a @xmath14 appreciably larger @xmath61 .",
    "= 3.2 in = 3.2 in = 3.2 in    to determine the position of the deconfinement transition we examine histograms of the magnitudes of the wilson line close to the transition for each mass .",
    "although the explicit breaking of the @xmath80 centre symmetry means that the magnitudes of the positive and complex wilson lines are not identical , they are close enough in the vicinity of the deconfinement transition that this fact can be ignored . such histograms are presented in figure  [ fig : wilhist ] . for the lower 2 masses the histogram for each beta represents 50,000 trajectories . at @xmath35",
    "the histograms for @xmath83 and @xmath84 represent 100,000 trajectories each , while that at @xmath85 is for 200,000 trajectories . in each case the histogram peaks at a low value below the transition and an appreciably higher value above the transition . very close to the transition",
    "the peak of the histogram is relatively flat , with some hint of a double peaked structure . from these graphs we estimate that the transition @xmath14s ( @xmath61 ) are @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively . as in the @xmath0 case ,",
    "the mass dependence is weak .",
    "= 5.0 in    again we estimate the position of the chiral - symmetry restoration transition by examining the peaks in the chiral susceptabilities for @xmath89 .",
    "as for @xmath0 we obtain estimates of the chiral condensate from 5 independent noise vectors , which yields an unbiased estimate for the chiral susceptibility .",
    "these chiral susceptibilities are plotted versus @xmath14 in figure  [ fig : chi6 ] for each of these lowest two masses .",
    "again , the @xmath14s we use in this region are two sparse to allow the use of ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting to interpolate between them .",
    "since our estimate for the peak of the susceptibility plots for each mass is @xmath90 , we estimate for the position of the chiral transition at @xmath62 is @xmath91 .",
    "note that this estimate is for the states with positive real wilson lines only .",
    "starting at @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath35 with a real negative wilson line , we find that this state is stable for runs of up to 50,000 trajectories for @xmath14s down to @xmath82 . decreasing this to @xmath92 ,",
    "we find that the system has transitioned to a state with a wilson line oriented in the direction of one of the complex cube roots of unity . figure  [ fig : neg.to.complex ] shows the time evolution of the phases of the wilson lines at @xmath92 and @xmath82 for @xmath35 .",
    "we see that the way the transition proceeds is that the fluctuations in the phase become large as @xmath14 approaches the transition from above until eventually they reach @xmath93 and @xmath94(@xmath95 ) .",
    "when this occurs the system spends appreciably more time at these two values that at intermediate values .",
    "we can then consider the system as being in a state with its wilson line oriented in the direction of one of the two complex cube roots of unity . on the finite lattice it tunnels between these 2 states .",
    "approaching this transition from below we could describe it as the disordering of the 2 states with wilson lines in the directions of the complex cube roots of unity , as suggested by machtey and svetitsky .",
    "the position of this transition for @xmath35 is at @xmath96 , while for @xmath34 it occurs at @xmath97 .",
    "we simulated qcd with two flavours of staggered quarks at finite temperatures using the rhmc method .",
    "our simulations were performed on @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 lattices with 3 quark masses , to allow for chiral extrapolations .",
    "we find widely separated deconfinement and chiral - symmetry restoration transitions .",
    "both the deconfinement and chiral transitions move to significantly lower couplings as @xmath21 is increased from 4 to 6 , which is the expected behaviour for finite temperature transitions in an asymptotically free theory .",
    "this suggests that the theory is confining with spontaneously - broken chiral symmetry , while being under the control of the weak - coupling asymptotically - free ultraviolet fixed point , i.e. that it walks .",
    "the deconfinement transition occurs at @xmath98 where for @xmath0 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 while for @xmath3 , @xmath88 , @xmath87 and @xmath86 .",
    "the chiral - symmetry restoration transition occurs at @xmath102 , where @xmath103 at @xmath0 and @xmath104 at @xmath3 .",
    "the large separation of the deconfinement and chiral transitions indicates that the enhanced attraction between quark - antiquark pairs over that for fundamental quarks due to the larger quadratic casimir operator for the sextet representation ( @xmath105 versus @xmath106 ) , causes a chiral condensate to form at a distance much shorter than the scale of confinement .",
    "this effectively removes the quarks from consideration at longer distances where the theory will behave more like a pure glue ( quenched ) theory .",
    "this is presumably why , in the deconfined phase , we see a three state system , where the wilson lines align in the directions of one of the cube roots of unity , a relic of the now - broken @xmath80 symmetry . the breaking of @xmath80 is seen in the difference in magnitudes of the real positive wilson lines versus those with phases close to @xmath107 . at @xmath0 , the states with complex wilson lines are only metastable , while at @xmath3 all 3 states appear to be stable . the existence of states with all 3 @xmath80 wilson line orientations has been predicted by machtey and svetitsky @xcite who observed them in their simulations with 2 flavours of colour - sextet wilson quarks .",
    "they also observed the metastability of the states with complex wilson lines .",
    "earlier simulations by degrand , shamir and svetitsky had reported deconfined states with wilson lines oriented in the directions of the complex cube roots of unity @xcite .",
    "more work needs to be done to determine whether the chiral - symmetry restoring transition of these complex / negative wilson line states is coincident with that of the state with a positive wilson line .",
    "in addition we would like to know whether this chiral transition shows the scaling properties of the expected @xmath108 universality class .",
    "the fact that this transition occurs at relatively weak coupling should help us in this endeavour .",
    "we have also observed an additional transition . at @xmath68 on an @xmath0 lattice with @xmath35 or @xmath34 , the states with complex wilson lines disorder to a state with a negative wilson line .",
    "such a transition is also observed for @xmath3 at @xmath96 for @xmath35 and @xmath109 for @xmath34 .",
    "the existence of states with negative wilson lines and of such a transition is predicted and observed by machtey and svetitsky .",
    "such a transition would be expected to be either a second - order phase transition in the universality class of the 3-dimensional ising model , or a first - order phase transition .",
    "the large increase in the @xmath14 for this transition between @xmath0 and @xmath3 makes us suspect that this is a lattice artifact .",
    "we also note that by @xmath3 , it is close to the chiral transition and could well merge with it at larger @xmath21 .",
    "since the negative wilson line state ( phase @xmath24 ) comes from disordering the two states with phases @xmath107 ( a fact also predicted by machtey and svetitsky ) , the magnitude of the wilson line above the transition is approximately half what it is below the transition . just below the transition ,",
    "the magnitude of wilson line in the complex wilson line states is approximately @xmath110 that of the positive wilson line state , so that after the transition the magnitude of the negative wilson line is approximately @xmath111 of that of the positive wilson line .",
    "this would suggest that the transition might be associated with the symmetry breaking @xmath112 .",
    "we need to understand why we see well - separated deconfinement and chiral transitions with staggered fermions , whereas degrand , shamir and svetitsky observed these transitions to be coincident with wilson fermions . of course , since we are far from the weak - coupling limit , different fermion actions do not have to have the same physics .",
    "this is especially true , if we happen to be in the strong - coupling domain , beyond the infrared fixed point of a conformal field theory .",
    "of course , the observation from our simulations that the coupling at each of the transitions is decreasing as the lattice spacing is decreasing would appear to exclude this possibility , since the @xmath14 function becomes positive above this fixed point .",
    "however , it has recently been suggested that there could be two non - trivial fixed points @xcite in such theories . in this case , if we are beyond the second non - trivial fixed point ( which would be an ultraviolet fixed point ) , the coupling would decrease at short distances .",
    "of course , if we are beyond the region where the ultraviolet behaviour of the theory is controlled by asymptotic freedom , drawing any conclusions is pure speculation .    to better understand our results , and to help determine whether the theory is indeed walking , rather than conformal as indicated by the work of degrand , shamir and svetitsky using wilson fermions",
    ", we are now extending our simulations to @xmath113 , where finite lattice spacing effects should be reduced , to see if the deconfinement and chiral - symmetry restoration transitions remain consistent with being finite - temperature transitions .",
    "we also plan to perform simulations at zero temperature , measuring the chiral condensate , the hadron spectrum , @xmath114 , etc .",
    ", to test other aspects of the theory which should help us determine whether this theory is conformal or walking .",
    "in addition we will try to determine the running of a suitably - defined renormalized coupling .",
    "having two different spatial lattice sizes at @xmath0 showed us that finite size effects are small .",
    "we need a second spatial lattice size for @xmath3 .",
    "we have learned that the authors of reference @xcite are now starting simulations of this theory using improved staggered fermions , which should help resolve these issues @xcite .",
    "we are now performing simulations of lattice qcd with 3 flavours of staggered quarks at finite temperature . since",

    "<S> qcd with two flavours of massless colour - sextet quarks is considered as a model for conformal / walking technicolor . </S>",
    "<S> if this theory possess an infrared fixed point , as indicated by 2-loop perturbation theory , it is a conformal(unparticle ) field theory . </S>",
    "<S> if , on the other hand , a chiral condensate forms on the weak - coupling side of this would - be fixed point , the theory remains confining . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference between such a theory and regular qcd is that there is a range of momentum scales over which the coupling constant runs very slowly ( walks ) . in this first analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we simulate the lattice version of qcd with two flavours of staggered quarks at finite temperatures on lattices of temporal extent @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the deconfinement and chiral - symmetry restoration couplings give us a measure of the scales associated with confinement and chiral - symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in contrast to what is seen with fundamental quarks , these transition couplings are very different . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 for each of these transitions increases significantly from @xmath0 and @xmath3 as expected for the finite temperature transitions of an asymptotically - free theory . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a walking rather than a conformal behaviour , in contrast to what is observed with wilson quarks . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to what is found for fundamental quarks , the deconfined phase exhibits states in which the polyakov loop is oriented in the directions of all three cube roots of unity . at very weak coupling the states with complex polyakov loops undergo a transition to a state with a real , negative polyakov loop . </S>"
