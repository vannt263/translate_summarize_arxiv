    "each of which consists of a homology cobordism @xmath3 between two copies of a compact surface and markings of both sides of the boundary of @xmath3 ( see section [ section : cylinder ] for details ) , appeared in the context of the theory of finite type invariants for 3-manifolds .",
    "the set of homology cylinders over a surface has a natural monoid structure .",
    "goussarov @xcite , habiro @xcite , garoufalidis - levine @xcite and levine @xcite studied it systematically by using the clasper ( or clover ) surgery theory .    since both sutured manifolds and homology cylinders deal with cobordisms between surfaces , it is natural to observe their precise relationship . in this paper , we first give a specific answer by restricting sutured manifolds to those obtained from knots .",
    "that is , we discuss which knot and its seifert surface define a homology cylinder as a complementary sutured manifold and conclude in section [ section : fibre ] that such a case occurs exactly when we take a knot with a minimal genus seifert surface whose alexander polynomial is monic and has degree twice the genus of the knot ( see theorem [ thm : homologicalfibre ] , where the cases of links are also discussed ) .",
    "we call such a knot a _ homologically fibered knot_. several examples of homologically fibered knots are presented in the same section .",
    "it is well known that fibered knots satisfy the above conditions for homologically fibered knots .",
    "in fact , they define homology cylinders with the product cobordism on a surface with markings ( called _ monodromies _ in the theory of fibered knots ) . on the other hand ,",
    "interesting examples of homologically fibered knots come from non - fibered knots .",
    "they give homology cylinders whose underlying cobordisms are not product . to construct such homology cylinders , it has been known the following methods :    * connected sums of the trivial cobordism with homology 3-spheres ; * levine s method ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) using string links in the 3-ball ; * habegger s method @xcite giving homology cylinders as results of surgeries along string links in homology 3-balls ; and * clasper surgeries ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that each of the latter two methods ( together with changes of markings ) give all homology cylinders .",
    "however those methods need surgeries along links with multiple components , so that it seems slightly difficult to imagine the resulting manifolds .",
    "our result in section [ section : fibre ] shall provide an _ explicit _ construction of homology cylinders .",
    "the above mentioned relationship between sutured manifolds and homology cylinders will be studied further in the latter half of this paper .",
    "we apply invariants of homology cylinders defined in @xcite to homologically fibered knots . in particular , we focus on magnus representations and reidemeister torsions of homology cylinders , whose definitions are recalled in section [ sec : magnus ] .",
    "the definitions will be given in such a general form that we can apply frameworks of cochran - orr - teichner s theory @xcite of higher - order alexander modules and friedl s theory @xcite of noncommutative reidemeister torsions .",
    "as an immediate application , it turns out that they give fibering obstructions of homologically fibered knots .",
    "we also use them to derive factorization formulas of reidemeister torsions of the exterior of a homologically fibered knot in section [ sec : factorization ] .",
    "more applications are given in sections [ section : handle ] and [ sec : nakanishi ] .",
    "we consider _ handle numbers _ of sutured manifolds , which may be regarded as an analogue of the heegaard genus of a closed 3-manifold for a sutured manifold . see @xcite for details .",
    "we discuss lower estimates of handle numbers by using the above mentioned invariants of homology cylinders .",
    "in particular , we consider doubled knots with certain seifert surfaces and give a lower bound of their handle numbers by using nakanishi index @xcite .",
