    "many years ago in a brief note@xcite concerning relativistic angular momentum , we made the claim , largely as an afterthought and with only a skimpy argument presented , that there was a simplegeometric classical argument that led to the dirac value of the gyromagnetic ratio of a charged massive particle .",
    "there was no mention of either quantum mechanics or the dirac equation .",
    "the argument made then , was based on a kinematic analogy concerning certain algebraic properties of the angular momentum tensor and the electric - magnetic dipole tensor , and has on several occasions been reasonably questioned . in the present note",
    "we return to the same issue and give the complete argument , including details of the dynamics that lead to the relevant algebraic properties .",
    "we make the following pair of claims : consider first both the vacuum maxwell field and the linearized vacuum gravitational field on ( ordinary real ) minkowski space .",
    "it is possible to view ( purely in a mathematical sense by the analytic continuation of the real fields into the complex ) that the magnetic moment @xmath0 of a particle with charge @xmath1 , arises from the particle being displaced an imaginary distance ( @xmath2 ) into complex minkowski space so that @xmath3 also , classical relativistic spin - angular momentum @xmath4 can be interpreted ( using linearized general relativity ) as arising from the displacement ( @xmath5 ) of a massive monopole particle , @xmath6 ( schwarzschild solution ) also into the complex so that @xmath7 we refer to @xmath8 and @xmath9 as respectively , the complex centers of charge and mass . the second claim is simply the observation that",
    "when the two imaginary displacements are the same , i.e. , @xmath10 then the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath11 is the dirac value , @xmath12 this can be restated more geometrically as ; given a real solution of the linearized einstein equations ( on real minkowski space ) with non - vanishing mass and a solution of the maxwell equations with non - vanishing charge , if the associated angular momentum and magnetic moment are _ interpreted _ as arising from a _ complex _ _ center of mass _ and a _ complex center of charge _ _ that coincide _",
    ", then the resulting gyromagnetic ration is that of dirac .",
    "we stress that this is simply an observation and it remains to be shown if it has any further physical significance .",
    "a point that we want to emphasis is that we are dealing , here , strictly with the vacuum fields and are not considering the nature or structure of the sources .",
    "what we are calling the charge , the dipole moments , the mass and angular momentum are the coefficients of the relevant terms in @xmath13 expansions of the maxwell and gravitational fields . the structure of the sources has been discussed elsewhere@xcite .    another point that we wish to make is that this result , though it appears to depend on the linearized einstein equations , remains though in a different form in full gr .",
    "the charged kerr solution ( with parameters @xmath14 also has the dirac gyromagnetic ratio and can be `` obtained '' from the schwarzschild solution by a complex translation@xcite .    in sec.ii",
    ", we will write the maxwell equations in such a way so that the complex interpretation becomes obvious and furthermore show how the real simple coulomb solution , by a complex translation , can be reinterpreted as having a magnetic moment . in sec .",
    "iii , we will rewrite the linearized vacuum einstein equations as equations for the weyl tensor ( often considered as the gravitational analogue of the maxwell tensor ) and see its remarkable similarity with the maxwell equations",
    ". the complex translation interpretation of angular momentum simply follows as does our conclusion concerning the gyromagnetic ratio . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we point out possible physical consequences of these observations . in an appendix",
    "we examine , without a real resolution , how a rather strange complex coordinate transformation is equivalent to a real transformation .",
    "we begin with the standard vacuum maxwell equations defined on minkowski space ,    @xmath15 } & = & 0\\leftrightarrow \\nabla _ { a}f^{*ab}=0   \\label{max2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath16    we use for the flat metric @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20    by defining the ( self - dual ) complex combination    @xmath21    the maxwell equations become the single complex equation @xmath22    it is often useful to see the matrix form of @xmath23 in terms of cartesian components of the electric and magnetic fields , i.e. , as    @xmath24    @xmath25    by decomposing eq.([complexmax ] ) , into its time - space parts , using @xmath26 for the space part and @xmath27 for the time part and    @xmath28    we have    @xmath29    in 3-vector terms , it becomes    @xmath30    the vector form of maxwell s equations , with @xmath31    the value in this formulation , is that we can now think of the equations , as equations for a complex vector on a four complex dimensional manifold , @xmath32 the complexification of minkowski space , @xmath33 .",
    "when any complex solution is found as a function of the four complex coordinates , @xmath34 i.e. , of the form , @xmath35 one can simply chose , @xmath36 as four real constants and then take the real and imaginary parts of @xmath37 to construct an@xmath38 and @xmath39 i.e. , a real maxwell field on real @xmath40 since the equations do not have any explicit coordinate dependence , solutions will go over to solutions if they are transformed by complex poincare transformations .",
    "if the transformations were real then the resulting new solutions are completely equivalent to the untransformed solutions ; but if the transformations are intrinsically complex ( or imaginary ) then the new real solutions are genuinely different from the starting solution .",
    "we will illustrate this with the coulomb solution ( in the vacuum region ) transformed by a complex translation@xcite and in the process show how the magnetic moment arises from the complex translation .",
    "considering the coulomb solution in any of the following forms    @xmath41}}{r^{2 } }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with a unit radial vector , @xmath42 and particle velocity @xmath43 given in the rest - frame , we study the `` same solution '' thought of as translated into the complex , i.e. , we replace the real coordinates by the complex translated ones ;    @xmath44    with    @xmath45    a complex spatial translation .",
    "if we denote the complex translated quantities with a hat ( ) then , keeping only low powers of @xmath46 we have    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    the new solution , obtained from the complex translated space coordinates , keeping terms up to @xmath51 is    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath52    @xmath54    with the complex dipole moment @xmath55    @xmath56    this corresponds to a static electric monopole and dipole field with , in addition , a magnetic dipole field .",
    "the real part of @xmath57 is the electric dipole moment ,    @xmath58    and the imaginary part is the magnetic dipole moment ,    @xmath59    _ both _ arising from the complex translation . note that identifying the magnetic moment with @xmath60 is dimensionally correct .    the relativistic version of eq.([what ] )",

    "in an analogous fashion , from the complex point of view , the entire complex dipole moment can be transformed away , ( in the stationary case ) by    @xmath76}=0   \\label{cd}\\ ] ]    with @xmath77 defining ( with arbitrary complex @xmath78 the _ complex center of charge _ world line . in the time",
    "dependent case neither dipole can be transformed way but one could still define the complex center of charge so that instantaneously in some frame it can be transformed away .    viewed in this formal manner , we see that both an electric and magnetic dipole can be interpreted as arising from a charged particle ( with no dipole moments ) moving along a complex world line .",
    "though in general relativity , ( gr ) , the most common point of view is to think of the metric tensor as the basic and physical field variable with other variables obtained from the metric , there are nevertheless good reasons to consider other variables as perhaps more fundamental . in particular , one often thinks of the metric as analogous the vector potential of maxwell theory with the weyl tensor the analogue of the maxwell field . without being ideological about it",
    ", we will see that , at least , in linear theory the analogy is remarkably accurate .",
    "before we consider the linearization of gr , several remarks about the weyl tensor are useful .",
    "the weyl tensor , @xmath79 which is the trace - free part of the full curvature tensor is equal to the curvature tensor when the vacuum einstein equations are satisfied - with no cosmological constant . under these circumstance the bianchi identities @xmath80}\\equiv 0   \\label{bi}\\ ] ] become differential equation for the weyl tensor ,    @xmath81ab}=0   \\label{wbi}\\ ] ]    or @xmath82 where the dual on the first pair is    @xmath83    since dualing on the right pair yields@xcite @xmath84 eq.([dwbi ] ) can be written as    @xmath85    by combining them and relabeling indices , we obtain , using the complex weyl tensor , our basic field , the self - dual weyl tensor @xmath86 with its field equation @xmath87 note that    @xmath88    by linearized gr , we will mean eq.([dbi ] ) , where the covariant derivative is taken with the flat metric connection .",
    "this is the first example of the analogy with maxwell theory , via eq.([complexmax ] ) .    in analogy with the fact that all the components of @xmath23 can be expressed in terms of @xmath89 we have the following identities coming from eq.([sd2 ] )    @xmath90    which allows all components of @xmath91 to be expressed in terms of    @xmath92",
    "@xmath93 is a complex , symmetric , trace - free , 3x3 , tensor that contains all the 10 components of the weyl tensor .    writing this out in 3 + 1 notation ,",
    "we first have    @xmath94    which , with @xmath95 and @xmath96 further decomposes into    @xmath97    with @xmath98 and @xmath99 we have    @xmath100    and @xmath101 using the identities , ( [ identities ] ) , the last equation from both previous sets follow from the first equation of the set .",
    "we thus have that @xmath102 is equivalent to    @xmath103    or , with @xmath104 in dyadic form , @xmath105    @xmath106    these are the linearized einstein equations for the weyl tensor .",
    "note the extraordinary similarity in form , with the complex version of the maxwell equations , ( [ 3 + 1 ] ) .",
    "again , as in the maxwell case , we can generate new solutions , by complex poincare transformations , from old solutions or equivalently by finding complex solutions depending on the complex minkowski coordinates , @xmath107 and choosing @xmath108 as constants .",
    "it has been well known for many years that eq.([dbi ] ) can be viewed as the linear einstein equations .",
    "we , however , have not been able to find in the literature the particular form , ( [ 3 + 1gr ] ) , that so mimics the maxwell equations .",
    "though we would be surprised , it might well be new .",
    "we apply this idea to the monopole ( or linearized schwarzschild solution ) and obtain the linearized kerr solution . beginning with the monopole solution in any of the equivalent forms    @xmath109}v^{[b}n^{d]}+\\frac{1}{3}4v^{[a}\\eta ^{c][d}v^{b ] } ) ,",

    "it follows that @xmath156 and hence @xmath157 obtaining the dirac value of the gyromagnetic ratio by a purely classical argument .",
    "it has long been known , first pointed out by brandon carter , that the exact charged kerr@xcite solution of the einstein - maxwell equations possessed the dirac gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "though at first this created a bit of a stir and interest , it nevertheless did not go anywhere and eventually faded from general interest .",
    "nevertheless , in one form or another , intermittently there have been a long series of papers related to the issue . in some sense",
    "the present paper appears to give a simple geometric origin for carter s observation .",
    "first it suggests that a particle s magnetic moment and intrinsic spin arises as a `` shadow '' or `` projection '' into the real , of a particle moving in the complex space - time and that in particular the dirac value arises when a particle s complex center of charge _ coincides _ with its complex center of mass .",
    "one s first hope is that there is something profound about this result and perhaps there is , nevertheless after much thought , we and others have not seen anyway to further develop these ideas and at the present the issues lie dormant@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we are led to conjecture that every massive , charged elementary particle with spin will possess the dirac gyromagnetic ratio .    as a final item ,",
    "we point out that though the example used here was based on the static electric and mass monopole fields , these can be greatly generalized .",
    "one can construct real maxwell and linearized einstein fields by considering the generalization of the lienard - wiechart fields to that of a point source moving along an arbitrary complex world - line in complex minkowski space .",
    "this leads to real fields with time varying magnetic dipoles and spin - angular momentum .",
    "the extension of these ideas to the full non - linear einstein - maxwell equations leads to algebraically special metrics@xcite .",
