    "the dynamical matrices are calculated on a 6@xmath416@xmath411 q - point grid .",
    "for the two systems , after structural relaxation , because of the formation of c - h bonds , the hydrogenated carbon atoms are pulled out of the graphene plane and the hybridization of them changes from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , which is similar to graphane and graphone . for c@xmath0h@xmath1 , the c - c ( with one c bonded with h ) and c - h bond lengths are 1.496 and 1.137 @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "whereas for the unhydrogenated carbon atoms , the c - c bond length barely changes . for c@xmath0h@xmath2 ,",
    "the c - h bond length with the h atoms above and below the graphene plane are 1.104 and 1.131 @xmath8 , respectively .",

    "for c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath0h@xmath2 , to find which atoms contribute most to the spin polarization , we plot the spin - polarized and orbital - projected dos for all the atoms .",
    "the results for the two systems are shown in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 , respectively .",
    "we first discuss the result of c@xmath0h@xmath1 . combined with fig .",
    "1(c ) in the main text , it is found that the 7 atoms in a unit cell can be divided into four groups : ( 1 ) h atom , ( 2 ) c@xmath45 atom , ( 3 ) c@xmath16 atoms , and ( 4 ) c@xmath46 atoms , with each group showing the same dos .",
    "the reason is , by building the supercell of c@xmath0h@xmath1 , it is easy to see that c@xmath7 , c@xmath35 , and c@xmath0 atoms are the nearest neighbours of the hydrogenated carbon atoms . therefore , the lattice symmetry determines that the dos of them are the same .",
    "similarly , c@xmath47 and c@xmath2 atoms are the next nearest neighbours of the hydrogenated carbon atoms , and also show the same dos . from fig .",
    "2 , we can see that c@xmath16 atoms , i.e. , the nearest neighbours of the hydrogenated carbon atoms contribute most to the total dos around the fermi energy and also to the spin polarization .",
    "the next main contribution is from the h atom , while the contributions of other atoms can be ignored . to be more specific ,",
    "we check and find that the spin polarization mainly comes from the 2p@xmath48 orbital ( @xmath49 electrons ) of the c@xmath16 atoms .",
    "this can be understood that the @xmath42 hybridized c@xmath45 atom becomes @xmath43 hybridized after hydrogenation and forms strong @xmath50 bonds with h atom , while the @xmath49 electrons of unhydrogenated c@xmath16 atoms are more localized compared with those in pure graphene , and therefore become spin polarized . however , for the next nearest neighbours c@xmath46 atoms , the @xmath49 electrons are still delocalized and therefore contribute little to spin polarization .    for c@xmath0h@xmath2 , we plot the spin - polarized and orbital - projected electronic dos for each atom , which are shown in fig .",
    "3 . according to the symmetry of the lattice , the 11 atoms in the unit cell ( fig .",
    "1(d ) in the main text ) can be divided into 5 groups : ( 1 ) h@xmath51 atoms , ( 2 ) h@xmath16 atoms , ( 3 ) c@xmath51 atoms , ( 4 ) c@xmath16 atoms , and ( 5 ) c@xmath2 atom , with each group showing the same dos . the calculated results in fig . 3 show that the 2p@xmath48 orbital ( @xmath49 electron ) of c@xmath2 atom , i.e. , the unhydrogenated carbon atom contributes the most to the dos around the chemical potential and the spin - polarization , whereas the 1@xmath4 orbitals of h@xmath16 atoms , i.e. , the hydrogen atoms on the nearest neighbours of the unhydrogenated carbon atom contribute very little .",
    "for other atoms , because of the formation of @xmath43 hybridization after hydrogenation , they do not contribute to the dos and spin - polarization near the chemical potential .",
    "atom , ( c ) c@xmath16 atoms , and ( d ) c@xmath46 atoms in c@xmath0h@xmath1.,width=8 ]     atoms , ( b ) h@xmath16 atoms , ( c ) c@xmath51 atoms , ( d ) c@xmath16 atoms , and ( e ) c@xmath2 atom in c@xmath0h@xmath2.,width=8 ]",
    "as was explained in the main text , by doping electrons ( holes ) to c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath0h@xmath2 , we can get a fully spin - polarized fermi surface consisting of one ( two ) circular electron ( hole ) pocket(s ) at the @xmath10 point ( two @xmath9 points ) of the brillouin zone .",
    "while the spin - polarization of the charge carriers for electron - doped and hole - doped c@xmath0h@xmath2 are opposite , they are the same for c@xmath0h@xmath1 .    as an important low - temperature instability to all metallic systems ,",
    "it is interesting to study the possible superconducting transition in these new ferromagnetic metals .",
    "this is particularly true for c@xmath0h@xmath1 , since it is much easier to dope charge carriers to this semimetal .",
    "we thus focus in what follows on c@xmath0h@xmath1 , the conclusions for which should also be applicable to c@xmath0h@xmath2 .",
    "since we have fully spin - polarized fermi surfaces for both electron - doped and hole - doped cases , all possible pairing channels should be equal - spin spin - triplet . to conform to the fermi statistics ,",
    "the spatial part of the superconducting order parameter should be an odd function . as a result , while the full pairing interaction might have both even - parity and odd - parity components , only the odd - parity component is active in inducing a superconducting transition .",
    "we first consider the electron - doped case , for which the fermi surface is a circle around the @xmath10 point ( see fig .",
    "5(a ) in the main text ) . to gain a qualitative understanding of the possible pairing channel",
    ", we consider a generic pairing interaction in the @xmath19-wave channel , which is the leading odd - parity pairing interaction .",
    "we assume that the pairing interaction is nonzero only within a small window of @xmath52 $ ] around the fermi surface .",
    "we thus write the phenomenological pairing interaction as @xmath20 where the summation over @xmath53 and @xmath54 are restricted to be close to the chemical potential .",
    "the lattice constant @xmath55 will be set as the length unit ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) in the following analysis . to conform to the @xmath22 symmetry of the c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath0h@xmath2 lattices , the pairing potential is taken to be the following form @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the total area of the sample .",
    "@xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are linear combinations of the basis of the twofold - degenerate @xmath27 representation of the @xmath22 point group , and are defined as @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59,@xcite in which @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . for the present electron - doped system ,",
    "the fermi surface of which is close to the center of the brillouin zone ( bz ) ( i.e. , the @xmath10 point ) , it is reasonable to express the physical quantities in terms of polynomials of the wave vector .",
    "thus , we expand the pairing potential approximately as @xmath63 where @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) are the radial and azimuthal coordinate components of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) in the polar coordinate . define @xmath68 as the energy of electrons in the spin - up band relative to the chemical potential @xmath69 , @xmath70 is taken as a nonzero constant if both @xmath71 and @xmath72 lie within the range of @xmath52 $ ] .    introducing a mean - field decoupling to the pairing interaction by defining the superconducting order parameter @xmath73 we arrive at a mean - field hamiltonian of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 $ ] is the nambu basis for the spin - polarized band crossing the chemical potential .",
    "the @xmath76 factor in front of the @xmath53 summation removes the particle - hole redundancy in the nambu representation .",
    "the self - consistent equation for the pairing order parameter is obtained from the definition as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the inverse temperature and @xmath79 is the quasiparticle energy .    among all",
    "the possible @xmath19 wave equal - spin triplet pairing channels , whose symmetry factors @xmath80 are linear combinations of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , we make a comparison over three most probable channels : ( 1 ) @xmath32 , ( 2 ) @xmath33 , and ( 3 ) @xmath34 .",
    "this choice is motivated from the three equivalent representations of the pairing potential : @xmath83 = \\frac{1}{2}[(k_{x}+ik_{y})(k^{'}_{x}-ik^{'}_{y})+(k_{x}-ik_{y})(k^{'}_{x}+ik^{'}_{y})]$ ] .",
    "the three pairings are all nonunitary.@xcite we thus have for the @xmath30-th ( @xmath841,2,3 ) pairing channel the ansatz @xmath85 where @xmath31 is a real number measuring the pairing amplitude in the @xmath30-th channel . put this ansatz for @xmath86 back to eq.(6 ) , we get the following equation for determining the pairing amplitude @xmath31 and the corresponding superconducting transition temperature @xmath87 where the summations over @xmath53 and @xmath54 are restricted by @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    it is easy to see from eq.(8 ) that , all the three pairing channels considered have the same superconducting transition temperature @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the normal state density of states for the fully spin - polarized parabolic band and @xmath92 . in the limit of weak coupling , for which the pairing amplitude is small compared to the energy scales ( @xmath69 and @xmath93 ) of the problem , we can also get an analytical solution of the pairing amplitude for @xmath94 at zero temperature @xmath95 from eqs.(9 ) and ( 10 ) , we see that the relevant energy scale determining the superconducting transition is @xmath96 .",
    "to identify the leading pairing instability , we have to compare their ground state energies .",
    "the ground state energy is defined as the zero temperature average of the mean - field hamiltonian . since",
    "pairing occurs only within a small energy window around the chemical potential , it is enough to compare the energy for this part of the spin - polarized band . denoting the part of the ground state energy relevant to superconducting pairing as @xmath97 ( @xmath30=1,2,3 ) , we have @xmath98 @xmath99 is the heaviside step function , which is one for @xmath100 and zero otherwise .    for a typical set of parameters ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) , the pairing amplitudes and averaged",
    "ground state energies are shown separately in fig .",
    "4(a ) and fig .",
    "4(b ) , as a function of the effective strength of the pairing potential .",
    "as is clear from the figures , the two nodal phases with symmetry factors @xmath104 and @xmath105 are degenerate in energy .",
    "the ground state is the fully - gapped phase with symmetry factor @xmath106 .",
    "this stable phase , which is chiral in nature , is well - known to support chiral edge states and vortex zero modes both known as majorana fermions.@xcite    ) , as a function of the effective pairing strength @xmath107 .",
    "the three pairings are defined in the text . for each parameter",
    "considered , @xmath108 is exactly @xmath109 times of @xmath110 . only those states participating in pairing",
    "are included in calculating the ground state energy.,width=264 ]    now , we proceed to study the hole - doped case . as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) of the main text , the fermi surface consists of six disconnected patches at the @xmath9 points . from the periodicity in the momentum space , the fermi surface",
    "can also be regarded equivalently as consisting of two closed pockets situating respectively at the two inequivalent @xmath9 points at @xmath111 and @xmath112 , where @xmath55 has been set as the length unit .",
    "it should be noticed that , the effective mass of the charge carriers for the hole - doped case is much larger than that for the electron - doped case , thus the superconducting transition temperature for hole - doped case might also be significantly larger than that for the electron - doped case .    because the fermi surface and nearby low energy states are also fully spin - polarized , the pairing instability can only realize in the odd - parity spin - triplet channel , of which the @xmath19-wave component is usually dominant .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to start from the same phenomenological pairing potential , eq.(2 ) , used for the electron - doped case .",
    "since we now have two disconnected fermi pockets situated symmetrically with respect to the @xmath10 point , the pairing instability can occur either in the inter - pocket channel or in the intra - pocket channel .",
    "while the former is the conventional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state @xcite , the latter case is the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state with nonzero center of mass momentum @xcite .",
    "now , it is suitable to comment on the symmetry of the fermi surface .",
    "while for samples with extremely low doping concentrations the fermi pockets surrounding the @xmath9 points are almost circular for c@xmath0h@xmath1 , they show increasingly larger anisotropy as the doping concentration increases .",
    "the deviation from circular fermi pocket is also more obvious in c@xmath0h@xmath2 than for c@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "however , to make possible an analytical analysis , we will focus in what follows on fermi pockets having perfect circular symmetry centering at each @xmath9 point .",
    "the implications of the anisotropy in the fermi pockets are discussed afterwards .    for the assumed circular fermi pockets , the phase spaces for the bcs ( inter - pockets ) pairing and the fflo ( intra - pocket ) pairing",
    "are identical .",
    "we proceed to compare the effective pairing interactions in these channels . for clarity",
    ", we denote the creation operators for the electronic states close to @xmath113 and @xmath114 by @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the relative wave vectors as @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively for states close to @xmath113 and @xmath114 . for small hole doping , @xmath119 is also small and we can expand the pairing potential into polynomials of @xmath120 and @xmath121 .    for the fflo channel , the pairing interaction is expanded approximately by keeping only the leading - order terms as @xmath122 except for the replacement of @xmath53 by @xmath119 , the above pairing potential is identical to those in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 3 ) for the electron - doped case .",
    "following the same analysis as that for the electron - doped case , we thus expect that an isotropic @xmath3 ( or , put it in another equivalent form , @xmath123 ) superconductivity should originate in the two hole - fermi pockets separated by @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) , as the leading fflo pairing instability .    for the bcs channel",
    ", the pairing interaction is expanded approximately by keeping only the leading - order terms as @xmath126 interestingly , the approximate pairing interaction for the bcs channel also has the same dependence on the relative wave vectors @xmath119 and @xmath127 as the dependence on @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the electron - doped case ( eq.(3 ) ) .",
    "thus , following the same analysis as that for the electron - doped case , we expect that an isotropic @xmath123 superconductivity is the leading pairing instability in the bcs pairing channel .",
    "note that , the approximate pairing interactions in eqs.(12 ) and ( 13 ) do not depend on which pair of @xmath9 points we focus on to define the two fermi pockets . to determine the leading pairing instability for the hole - doped c@xmath0h@xmath1 ( and also for c@xmath0h@xmath2 ) , we have performed mean - field analysis parallel to those done for the electron - doped case . the pairing operator for the leading bcs pairing is taken as @xmath128 .",
    "for the leading fflo pairing , we define the pairing operator as @xmath129 for the fermi pocket surrounding @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the fermi pocket surrounding @xmath132 .    under the assumption that the fermi pockets are ideally circular , the leading bcs and fflo pairings defined above turn out to share the same transition temperature and ground state energy and are thus completely degenerate .",
    "however , as has been mentioned earlier , the fermi pockets around every @xmath9 point are in fact noncircular .",
    "similar to the fermi pockets of graphene , they in fact show a three - fold symmetry with respect to the @xmath9 point . on the other hand ,",
    "the two fermi pockets centering around @xmath113 and @xmath114 are symmetric with respect to the bz center . as a result of this actual symmetry of the fermi surface ,",
    "the phase space for the fflo pairing is suppressed as compared to that for the bcs pairing .",
    "therefore , for the hole - doped c@xmath0h@xmath1 and also for c@xmath0h@xmath2 , the leading pairing instability is in the bcs channel with @xmath123 ( or equivalently , @xmath3 ) symmetry .    to sum up",
    ", we have analyzed the leading pairing instability in both electron - doped and hole - doped c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath0h@xmath2 , in terms of a phenomenological pairing interaction respecting the @xmath22 symmetry of the material and completely spin polarized fermi surfaces . by comparing the mean - field ground state energies ,",
    "the chiral @xmath3 pairing is found to be the leading pairing instability for electron - doped systems . in the hole - doped cases , both fflo ( intra - pocket ) pairing and bcs ( inter - pockets ) pairing",
    "are possible .",
    "while the two are degenerate for circular fermi pockets , the bcs pairing is favored by the actual fermi pockets which has only three - fold symmetry .",
    "the leading bcs pairing for the hole - doped c@xmath0h@xmath1 has a @xmath3 symmetry and is thus also chiral .",
    "since the predicted stable pairings in both electron - doped and hole - doped cases support majorana fermions as edge states and vortex zero modes , the predicted superconducting phases for c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath0h@xmath2 may provide new platforms for studying the novel physics in spintronics @xcite and topological quantum computations @xcite .",

    "<S> however , it was later revealed that the trigonal adsorption of hydrogen atoms in graphone is not stable , it evolves into rectangular adsorption geometry and turns into an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) semiconductor with an indirect band gap of about 2.45 ev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there are several works studying the electronic properties of graphene with various hydrogen distributions and concentrations@xcite ; it has been found that the electronic properties can be altered dramatically , e.g. , opening a band gap , tuning the magnitude of the band gap of hydrogenated graphene by the hydrogen coverage , etc . </S>",

    "<S> exploring other kinds of hydrogenated graphene with novel properties is the main purpose of the present work .    searching for superconductivity in graphene is another long - time pursuit . </S>",
    "<S> pure graphene is not a superconductor due to the vanishing density of states ( dos ) at the dirac point . </S>",

    "<S> all of which were studied with ideal periodic structures , we thus consider only the periodic cases .    </S>",
    "<S> doping could be achieved experimentally by gating , including using an electrolyte gate , or by charge transfer , as done in graphene@xcite . for graphane </S>",
    "<S> , hole doping can be obtained by partially substituting carbon atoms with boron atoms@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it showed that the band structure and the dos of graphane near the chemical potential inside and outside the band gap are practically unchanged even up to a 12.5% boron doping . </S>",
    "<S> this justifies the use of a rigid - band approximation to simulate substitutional doping in graphane . </S>",
    "<S> the above work demonstrated that small substitutional dopings shift only the chemical potential and do not change the band structure near the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> our current doping is less than 1.6% hole or electron doping , which will also not change the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> of course , even if the dopants are randomly distributed , they should have negligible effect on the band structure at such a small concentration .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to make a comparison between the triplet - pairing superconductivity in c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h@xmath2 systems and those in heavy - metal ( uge@xmath7 @xcite , urhge @xcite , and ucoge @xcite ) or transition - metal based metallic compounds . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , the predicted c@xmath0h@xmath1/c@xmath0h@xmath2 may provide new platforms to study the coexistence of ferromagnetism and triplet - pairing superconductivity within @xmath19 electron orbitals .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we predicted two new types of hydrogenated graphene , c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath0h@xmath2 , and found they are a fm semimetal and a fm semiconductor with a narrow gap , respectively . </S>",
