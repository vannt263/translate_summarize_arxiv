    "in 1974 , hawking @xcite discovered that a black hole(bh ) behaves like a black body , emmitting thermal radiations with a temperature proportional to its surface gravity at the horizon and the related entropy is proportional to its horizon area @xcite .",
    "this entropy , temperature and the mass of the bh are related by the first law of bh thermodynamics @xmath2@xcite . due to the above thermodynamics - geometry relationship i.e. @xmath3",
    "there had been speculations in the literature that thermodynamic laws are in some how related to the einstein equations .",
    "the real picture came in 1995 when jacobson @xcite was able to formulate einstein equations from the thermodynamical laws .",
    "subsequently , padmanabhan @xcite showed the equivalence in the otherway .",
    "most discussions on bh thermodynamics have been related to static bh .",
    "subsequently , hayward @xcite have initiated the study of non - static bh ( dynamic bh ) by introducing the concept of trapping horizon . for",
    "spherically symmetric space - times he was able to write down the einstein field equations in a form , termed as unified first law and first law of thermodynamics for a dynamical bh can be obtained by projecting this unified first law along a trapping horizon .",
    "subsequently , a lot of works has been going on related to universal thermodynamics .",
    "these studies @xcite are mostly concentrated to homogeneous and isotropic frw model of the universe bounded by apparent or event horizon and conditions for the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics(gslt ) have been evaluated .",
    "+ in the present work , we formulate a general prescription of universal thermodynamics for frw model starting from an interacting @xmath0fluid system . by introducing , the state finder parameters",
    ", we derive the feasible region in the @xmath4plane for the validity of gslt . also formulating the evolution of the horizon ,",
    "a general restriction on the matter has been derived and it is applied to the frw model . +",
    "we consider a homogeneous , isotropic , flat , frw model of the universe .",
    "suppose the universe is filled up with interaction n - fluids having energy densities and thermodynamic pressures are @xmath5 .",
    "so the conservation equations are @xmath6    where @xmath7 stands for the interaction term related to @xmath8th fluid it may be positive or negative so that @xmath9 .",
    "now combining the @xmath0equations in @xmath10 we have @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the total energy density of the @xmath0fluids and @xmath13 is the total thermodynamic pressure of the @xmath0fluid .",
    "thus equation ( [ 2 ] ) can be considered as the energy conservation equation of the resulting single fluid having energy density @xmath14 and thermodynamic pressure @xmath15 . + the einstein field equations for the above interacting @xmath0fluid system are given by    @xmath16    and @xmath17    to study the thermodynamics of the universe as a thermodynamical system we start with the amount of energy crossing the horizon @xmath18 during an infinitesimal interval of the time @xmath19 as @xmath20    then from the clausius relation    @xmath21    we have , @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the heat flux crossing the horizon during the time interval @xmath19 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the temperature and entropy at the horizon .",
    "+ now the entropy @xmath26 of the matter of the universe inside the horizon can be related to its energy and pressure in the horizon by gibb s equation    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the sum of the entropies of different matter components , @xmath29 is the volume of the universe enclosed by the horizon and @xmath30 is the total energy of the matter bounded by the horizon . then using the conservation equation ( [ 2 ] ) and after a little bit of calculations we obtain the variation of the inside matter entropy as @xmath31\\ ] ] where for equilibrium thermodynamics we chose the temperature of the inside matter same as that of the horizon .",
    "thus combining ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) the time variation of total entropy ( matter and horizon ) is given by    @xmath32    thus generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) ( i.e. @xmath33 ) will always be true for ay one of the following two possibilities : + ( a)the equivalent single fluid for the interacting @xmath0fluid system is in quintessence era and horizon is non - decreasing with the evolution .",
    "+ ( b ) the equivalent single fluid system is in phantom era and horizon is contracting with the evolution .",
    "+ it should be noted that the validity of the gslt does not depend on any individual fluid nor on the interaction among the fluids .",
    "+ now we shall express the universal thermodynamics in terms of state finder parameters @xmath34 , proposed by sahni et al @xcite . according to them ,",
    "statefinder parameters are defined as    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "+ the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are dimensionless and @xmath37 forms the next step i the hierarchy of geometrical cosmological parameters after @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "it is speculated that these parameters together with coming snap observations may discriminate between different dark energy models .",
    "further , trajectories in the @xmath41 plane corresponding to different cosmological models demonstrate qualitatively different behaviour .",
    "+ now using these parameters @xmath42 the rate of change of the hubble parameter can be written as    @xmath43\\ ] ]    so from the einstein field equation ( [ 4 ] ) we have    @xmath44    thus variation of total entropy can be expressed in terms of @xmath41 parameters as    @xmath45       if we now draw the straight line @xmath46 in the @xmath1plane then region i ( see fig1 ) corresponds to the valid region for gslt to be satisfied provided horizon radius grows with the evolution of the universe otherwise region ii will be the possible region for validity of gslt .",
    "therefore , we can classify regions in the @xmath1plane where universe can be considered as a thermodynamical system .",
    "+ further , for the commonly used horizon in the literature , namely the apparent horizon given by + @xmath47    we have @xmath48 so @xmath49    thus we have the known result that gslt is always satisfied at the apparent horizon .",
    "+ on the other hand , the event horizon ( which is defined for accelerating model ) is defined as    @xmath50    and we have    @xmath51    and it can not be expressed in terms of @xmath52parameters . so in this case @xmath53 and region i or region ii is the possible solution for the validity of gslt . however , if we use the ricci s length scale namely    @xmath54    as the boundary of the universe , then @xmath55       the argument behind @xmath56 as the ir cut off in the holographic bound @xcite is that it corresponds to the size of the maximal perturbation , leading to the formation of a black hole .",
    "thus in this case the possible part of the the @xmath1plane for the validity of gslt is classified as + @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 in figure 2 we have identified regions a and b which are the valid region for the universal thermodynamics . +",
    "in this section , we study the growth or contraction of the horizon of a general non - static spherically symmetric black hole due to exchange of matter with its environment and then we extend this idea to the universal thermodynamics . any spherically symmetric gravitational field can be written as    @xmath60    the horizon is located at @xmath61 such that @xmath62 . to have a smooth system across the horizon we make the following painleve - type coordinate transformation :",
    "@xmath63    so that metric ( [ 21 ] ) becomes @xmath64    the incoming and out going radial null geodesics are defined by @xmath65 and so from equation ( [ 23 ] ) @xmath66\\ ] ] now we define the evolving horizon by the condition    @xmath67    thus if @xmath68 then out going light rays are dragged backwards towards origin . as a result",
    "we can define a function @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and is termed as evolving horizon .",
    "we can identify the mass function as    @xmath71\\ ] ]    and hence the horizon    @xmath72    further due to spherical symmetry , the hawking - isreal quasi local mass function @xcite namely ,    @xmath73\\ ] ]    is identified with @xmath74 defined in ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "so we can identify the function @xmath75 as the mass inside radius r at time t. + now taking total time derivative of both sides of equation ( [ 27 ] ) we have    @xmath76}{16 \\pi r_h(t)}\\frac{da_h(t)}{dt}\\ ] ]    where @xmath77 is the surface area of the horizon and here dot and dash stands for partial derivatives with respect to @xmath78 and @xmath37 respectively . + now comparing with the first law of black hole mechanics namely ,    @xmath79    the surface gravity on the horizon has the expression    @xmath80    it is to be noted that the surface gravity @xmath81 can also be obtained from the evolution equation of outward radial null vector    @xmath82    where @xmath83    is the out going radial null vector .",
    "+ as the metric coefficient @xmath84 is positive definite for @xmath85 so from ( [ 26 ] ) @xmath86 for @xmath85 or equivalently @xmath87    hence the surface gravity on the horizon is positive definite .",
    "further , using maple(or similar software ) one can calculate ( for details see ref @xcite ) for any @xmath88    @xmath89    so on the horizon ,    @xmath90    where in deriving the last equation we have used einstein equations @xmath91 .",
    "so from equation ( [ 29 ] ) we obtain @xmath92    further using ( [ 27 ] ) the total time derivative of the mass function at the horizon gives @xmath93    this gives the total mass change i.e. contributions both from mass flux across the horizon and from the motion of the horizon itself . thus due to inequality ( [ 34 ] ) we may conclude that as long as null energy condition ( nec ) is satisfied both the horizon as well as the mass bounded by the horizon can never decrease .",
    "+ as a particular case if we consider the flat frw model of the universe we can write the metric similar to ( [ 23 ] ) as    @xmath94    so the horizon is located at @xmath95 , the apparent horizon .",
    "the mass term is defined as @xmath96 and hence the mass bounded by the horizon is @xmath97 which is the usual mishner - sharp mass at the apparent horizon of the frw model .",
    "hence from ( [ 37 ] ) the evolution of the horizon is given by    @xmath98    hence from ( [ 14 ] ) using ( [ 42 ] ) we can say that validity of gslt does not depend on the type of fluid we are considering- the only criteria is whether fluid satisfies the null energy condition or not .",
    "in this work we have presented a general formulation of universal thermodynamics for flat , homogeneous and isotropic frw model of the universe . we have started with an interacting @xmath0 fluid system and have shown that the thermodynamics of the universe does not depend on any individual fluid nor on the interactions , it depends on the total matter density and thermodynamic pressure of the fluids i.e. for thermodynamical study we can take the interacting @xmath0fluid system as a single fluid satisfying the energy conservation relation ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "then we have introduced the state finder parameters and expressed the restrictions for the validity of gslt in terms of these parameters .",
    "also in the @xmath1plane we have shown the feasible regions graphically .",
    "+ in section ( iii ) , we have derived the evolution of the horizon for a general non - static spherically symmetric gravitating system and we have found ( see equation ( [ 38 ] ) ) that horizon radius increases or decreases depending on whether null energy condition is satisfied or not .",
    "then we have calculated the time derivative of the horizon radius ( see equation [ 42 ] ) for the frw model .",
    "+ therefore we can conclude that for a general prescription of univerasl thermodynamics in frw model , we need to know the feasible region in @xmath99 parameter plane and have to examine whether the resulting single fluid satisfies the nec or not . for future work ,",
    "we shall try , whether similar general features for universal thermodynamics can be obtained for a general space - time model of the universe .",
