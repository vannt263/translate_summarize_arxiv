    "the vela pulsar is one of the few @xmath1-ray pulsars , whose @xmath1-ray radiations are so intense that could be detected before the launch of @xmath0 @xmath1-ray telescopes . for this reason , the observed spectra and the pulse profiles of the vela pulsar",
    "have been studied extensively before the launch of @xmath0 ( romani , 1996 ; dyks , harding & rudak , 2004 ; takata , chang & shibata 2008 ) .",
    "its @xmath1-ray spectrum between 100mev to several gev is difficult to be explained in terms of simple curvature radiation .",
    "takata , chang & shibata ( 2008 ) proposed that the component around 100mev of the vela pulsar , as well as geminga ( takata & chang , 2009 ) , is due to the synchrotron radiation of the incoming particles in the outer gap . by solving the evolution of the lorentz factor and the pitch angle in the two - dimensional electrodynamics model ( takata , shibata & hirotani , 2004 )",
    ", they found that the synchrotron radiation of the incoming particles dominates the radiation around 10 mev to 100mev and the curvature radiation of the outgoing particles dominates the radiation around 1gev .",
    "zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) proposed a self - sustained thick outer gap model of @xmath1-ray emission from the rotation - powered pulsar .",
    "they pointed out that the primary @xmath2 pairs in the steady state have a power - law distribution and used this distribution to calculate the spectra of some @xmath1-ray pulsars , including geminga - like and vela - like pulsars .",
    "also based on this distribution of primary pairs , zhang & cheng ( 2001 ) applied a three - dimensional pulsar magnetosphere model to explain the high - energy emission from the geminga pulsar with a thick outer gap . in this calculation , the high - energy @xmath1-rays are produced by the accelerated particles with a power - law energy distribution via curvature radiation inside the outer gap .",
    "after the launch of @xmath0 lat , the bottleneck of the research of high energy radiation from pulsar is broken . just in one year , this high - quality @xmath1-ray telescope has measured 46 @xmath1-ray pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "we developed a two - layer model ( wang et al .",
    ", 2010 ) to study the phase averaged spectra of the mature pulsars , including the vela pulsar , in the first catalogue of @xmath1-ray pulsars of @xmath0 . in this simple two - dimensional model ,",
    "the outer gap extending outwards from the null charge surface is considered as a superposition of a main acceleration region and a screening region . in the main acceleration region , which is close to vacuum ,",
    "the electric field is strong , and the photons generated in this region dominate the radiation of around gev range . in the screening region ,",
    "the large numbers of the pairs produced by the pair - creation process stop the growth of the acceleration region and they produce the photons with around 100mev range .",
    "although this two - dimensional two - layer model could explain the phase - average @xmath1-ray spectra of the mature pulsars , it can not be used to study the phase - resolved spectra and the light curves .",
    "furthermore the high quality data of @xmath0 has clearly shown the existence of a third peak ( bump ) at the trailing part of the first peak , which was explained as an effect of geometry of the magnetic field ( dyks & rudak , 2003 ; fang & zhang , 2010 ) . however , the observed result provided by @xmath0 ( abdo et al , 2010b ) shows that , as the energy increases , this third peak shifts towards the second peak .",
    "this indicates that unlike those two main peaks this third peak does not result from the caustic effect of photon propagation and/or the structure of the magnetic field .",
    "the high - energy radiation processes of pulsars have been studied based on polar cap models ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; daugherty & harding , 1982 ) , the slot gap models ( arons 1983 ; harding , usov & muslimov 2005 ; harding et al .",
    "2008 ) and the outer gap models ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , b ; romani 1996 ; hirotani 2008 ; takata & chang 2009 ) .",
    "the different acceleration models have predicted different properties of the @xmath1-ray emission properties from the pulsar magnetosphere . to discriminate among these existed emission models ,",
    "it is better to compare the predicted phase resolved spectra with the observed ones , which contains the most detailed information about the structure of pulsar magnetosphere and the acceleration mechanism .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our study of two - layer model from two - dimensional to three - dimensional , which includes the effects of the inclination angle , viewing angle and the azimuthal structure of the gap .",
    "this three - dimensional model can provide the phase - resolved spectra and the energy - dependent light curves that can not be given by the two - dimensional one .",
    "we will use it to study the observed energy dependent light curves of the vela pulsar measured by @xmath0 lat ( abdo et al , 2010b ) .    in section  2 , we describe our theoretical model , which contains the electrodynamics of the outer gap , the emission geometry and the method to calculate the spectra and the light curves . in section 3",
    ", we will use our three - dimensional model to explain the energy dependent light curves of the vela pulsar and discuss the conditions of the existence of and the movement of the third peak as well as other observed spectral properties .",
    "we gives a brief summary in section 4 .",
    "we discuss the @xmath1-ray emissions from the outer gap accelerator in the pulsar magnetosphere , and assume that a strong acceleration region is extending above the last - open filed lines and between the null charge surface of the goldreich - julian charge density and the light cylinder .",
    "although the dynamical studies ( e.g. takata , shibata & hirotani , 2004 ) predict that the inner boundary of the active gap can extend inwards from the null charge surface , most of the power of the gap are released beyond the null charge surface . because the pairs are always created on convex side of the magnetic field lines , the charge number density increases as the height measured from the last - open field lines . in the trans - field direction of the magnetic field , therefore , as shown in figure  [ struct ] , the outer gap can be divided into two parts : 1 ) the main acceleration region at the lower part of the outer gap , where the charge density is assumed to be @xmath3 10  % of the goldreich - julian value and a strong electric field is accelerating the particles to emit gev photons via the curvature process , and 2 ) the screening region around the upper boundary , where the growth of the main acceleration region in the trans - field direction is stopped by the pair - creation process .",
    "such two - layer structure , in the direction along the field line , starts from a place between the inner boundary and the null charge surface , and ends at the light cylinder .",
    "inside the inner boundary and outside the light cylinder , there is no accelerating electric field ; from the null charge surface to the inner boundary , the accelerating electric field decreases rapidly to zero .",
    "because the number density of the pairs made by the pair - creation process increases exponentially in the trans - field direction ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , b ) , we use a simple step function to approximate the distribution of the charge density in the trans - field direction in the poloidal plane ( the plane where the field lines have same polar angle @xmath4 ) as @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath4 represent coordinates along the magnetic field line , the height measured from the last - open field line , and the azimuthal direction .",
    "in addition , @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the thickness of the main - accretion region and the total gap thickness , respectively .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ struct ] , in the @xmath7-direction , the main acceleration region spans from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , where the charge density is substantially smaller than the goldreich - julian charge density ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) , and the screening region is between @xmath12 , the charge density in it is much higher than @xmath13 in order to close the gap . for each poloidal plane ( @xmath4=constant ) ,",
    "@xmath14 as well as @xmath15 is defined with a given magnetic field line in the constant @xmath16-plane so that the ratio @xmath17 is nearly constant along the field lines .    even though the structure of the gap is simplified as described above , the three - dimensional poisson equation with the magnetic field structure",
    "is still difficult to be solved in comparing with the case of the two - dimensional model discussed in wang et al.(2010 ) . instead of solving the real three - dimensional poisson equation",
    ", we adopt a simplified poisson equation .",
    "we calculate the electric field structure at a fixed poloidal plane , that is , at each azimuthal coordinate by solving the two - dimensional poisson equation .",
    "this approximation can be justified if the derivation of the potential field in the azimuthal direction is much smaller than that in poloidal plane .",
    "this procedure may be applicable for the thin outer gap accelerator , whose thickness in the poloidal plane is much smaller than the width in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the detail procedure to obtain the three - dimensional structure is described as follows .    in a fixed poloidal plane ,",
    "the bottom and top boundaries of the outer gap are the last - open field lines and a surface layer with separation @xmath9 made by the magnetic field lines respectively .",
    "we divide the polar cap into @xmath18 equal divisions in the azimuthal direction .",
    "if the gap size of the azimuthal direction is much larger than the gap thickness in the poloidal plane , the gap structure of each slice with a fixed azimuthal angle @xmath4 may be approximately represented by the two - dimensional situation shown in wang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "the accelerating electric field in each slice of the gap is solved by the method described in the previous two - dimensional model(wang et al . , 2010 ) .",

    "this potential can be written as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the co - rotating potential , which satisfies @xmath22 , and the potential @xmath23 represents the deviation from co - rotating potential .",
    "this deviation generates the accelerating electric field . by assuming the derivation of the potential field in the azimuthal direction is small enough to be neglected compared with that in the poloidal plane",
    ", we express the poisson equation of @xmath24 as @xmath25 because our two - dimensional study predicts that the outer gap of the vela pulsar is thin , the variation of the goldreich - julian charge density in the trans - field direction ( that is @xmath7-direction ) may be able to be neglected so that the @xmath13 can be assumed to be constant in @xmath7-direction .    moreover , we assume that the derivative of the potential field in the trans - field ( z ) direction is larger than that along ( x - direction ) the magnetic field line",
    ". this assumption may be applicable for the thin outer gap accelerator of the vela pulsar . by ignoring the derivative of the potential field along the magnetic field line ,",

    "we can see in figure  [ edlc_nd ] that the model provided pulse profiles are generally consistent with the observations .",
    "for example , the pulsed profiles in wide energy bands have two main peaks with the separation of about 0.42",
    ". the positions of the two peaks in the light curves are determined by the geometry of the magnetic field .    in the present simple model ,",
    "however , the calculated pulse profile can not explain the existence of the observed third peak between two main peaks , as we can see in figure  [ edlc_nd ] .",
    "the peaks emerging in the calculated pulse profiles of figure  [ edlc_nd ] are caused by so called caustic effects ( yadigaloglu and romani 1995 ; cheng , ruderman and zhang 2000 ; dyks , harding and rudak 2004 ) , in which more photons are observed at narrow width of the rotation phase due to the special - relativistic effect ( that is , the aberration of the emission direction and photon s travel time ) . in the caustic model , the phases of the peaks are determined by the magnetic field structure and they do not depend on the energy band . on the other hand , the observed phase of the third peak shifts with the energy bands .",
    "the simple caustic model can not explain the phase shift of the observed third peak . on these ground , we speculate that the existence of the third peak and its phase shift is related with more complex structure of the emission region .      in this section",
    ", we discuss the third peak with a more complex gap structure by taking into account the azimuthal structure of the fractional gap thickness @xmath55 , the ratio of the thicknesses of the main acceleration region to the whole gap thickness , @xmath116 , and the particle number density in the main acceleration region , @xmath119 .",
    "firstly , we consider the azimuthal structure of fractional gap thickness and compare the calculated light curves with the observations .    by the definition of the gap fraction of equation  ( [ def_fm ] ) , @xmath129",
    ", we may choose the form of the azimuthal distribution of @xmath55 as , @xmath130 where the @xmath131 , @xmath132 is the maximum value of the polar cap radius , and the factor 0.18 is chosen by fitting the phase averaged - spectrum .",
    "the pulse profiles using the fractional thickness @xmath55 described by equation ( [ def_f ] ) are shown in figure  [ edlc_f ] , where @xmath133 and @xmath121 are the same with those of figure  [ edlc_nd ] . by comparing figure [ edlc_nd ] and [ edlc_f ]",
    ", we can find the effects of azimuthal distribution of @xmath55 on the pulse profiled .",
    "for example , the azimuthal structure of the fractional gap thickness produces more bridge emissions as well as a third - peak - like feature at the phase @xmath134 of the pulse profile ( in particular for higher energy bands ) in figure  [ edlc_f ] .",
    "figure  [ rp_phi ] shows the polar cap radius @xmath135 ( solid - line ) and the resultant fractional gap thickness @xmath55 ( dashed - line ) as a function of the polar angle .",
    "the polar angle=0@xmath136 is defined at the right - hand side of the north pole s magnetic axis in the plane including the rotation axis and the magnetic axis , where the rotation axis is at the left - hand side of magnetic axis in the north pole .",
    "hence the polar angle=180@xmath136 is defined at the left - hand side of the magnetic axis .",
    "the angle between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis is chosen to be @xmath137 90@xmath136 , therefore the outgoing radiation from the south pole can be detected with viewing angle @xmath137 90@xmath136 .",
    "in the south pole , the emissions on the magnetic field lines emerging from polar angle larger ( or smaller ) than @xmath138 produces the first ( or second ) peak .",
    "as shown in figure  [ rp_phi ] , the fractional thickness @xmath55 becomes maximum around the polar angle of 200@xmath136 , where @xmath58 becomes minimum . because larger fraction thickness @xmath55 produces a stronger @xmath59 as equation ( 10 ) indicates , the emissions on the magnetic field lines emerging from @xmath3 200@xmath136 is more stronger than those from @xmath139 and from @xmath140 .",
    "consequently , third - peak - like structure is formed in the light curves of figure  [ edlc_f ] .      in the electrodynamic point of view",
    ", the thickness of the screening region of the gap , @xmath141 , will be determined by the photo - photon pair - creation rate between the @xmath1-rays and x - rays from the stellar surface .",
    "it is expected that as the null charge surface is closer to the stellar surface , the number density of the x - ray photons increases in the gap and therefore the screening region becomes thinner .",
    "this indicates that the ratio of the thicknesses of the main acceleration region to the whole gap thickness , @xmath116 , is closer to unity as the null charge surface approaches to the stellar surface . because the radial distance to the null charge surface is a function of the azimuthal coordinate ,",
    "it is expected that the ratio @xmath116 varies in the azimuthal direction . to simulate above dependency ,",
    "let s assume the formula of the ratio as @xmath142 where the factor @xmath143 represents the ratio at the polar angle , at which the radial distance to the null charge surface becomes maximum , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 corresponds to the ratio at azimuthal angle , at which the radial distance to the null charge surface becomes minimum , @xmath146 . by fitting the spectral shape ,",
    "we obtain @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",

    ", one can see that the distribution of the @xmath116 does not affect much the light curves above energy @xmath149gev , but it makes a bump in the bridge ( @xmath150 pulse phase ) of the light curve around 100mev .",
    "we can see those light curves below @xmath151  gev in figure  [ edlc_h ] are more consistent with the observation than those of figure  [ edlc_nd ] .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show that the ratio of the thicknesses @xmath116 affects the emissivity in the screening region . because the particles in the screening regions , where the accelerating electric field is small , mainly produces the curvature photons of the energy less than @xmath152  gev , the azimuthal distributions of the thickness ratio affects the light curves below @xmath152  gev .",
    "figure  [ h1h2_phi ] shows the distributions of the radial distance to the null charge surface @xmath153 ( solid - line ) for the inclination angle @xmath124 and the corresponding @xmath116 ( dotted - line ) expressed by equation  ( [ h1/h2 ] ) .",
    "it shows that , at the polar angle@xmath3170@xmath136 that corresponds to pulse phase@xmath30.4 , the screening region is thinnest , which means the radiations below 1gev at the pulse phase @xmath3 0.4 are weaker than those of other pulse phases . consequently , the shape of the bridge emissions of the light curves becomes more consistent with the observations and stands out the third - peak - like structure .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of the particles will be more complicated , because it is related with ( 1 ) the motion of the particles under the lorentz force and ( 2 ) the propagating direction of the curvature photons , which are eventually converted into the pairs in the gap .",
    "for example , the non - co - rotational electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field lines causes @xmath154 drift motion of the particles .",
    "moreover , because of the flight time of the photons and of the rotation of the magnetosphere , the magnetic field line , on which the pairs are created by the pair - creation process , is different from the field line , where the photons were emitted by the curvature radiation process .    with the two - dimensional two - layer model ,",

    "( 2010 ) found that the phase - averaged spectra for most of the @xmath1-ray pulsars can be reproduced by the averaged charge density of @xmath155/h_2\\sim 0.5 $ ] .",
    "we want to point out that because the actual @xmath156 is different at different @xmath4 , particles in different @xmath4-cell may drift into other @xmath4-cell .",
    "therefore we assume that the averaged charge density has a distribution in the azimuthal direction due to the effect of @xmath157 drift motion . without the effect of drifting ,",
    "the number of particle in @xmath4-cell is @xmath158 . with the drifting effect , the real number of particle in @xmath4-cell ( @xmath159 )",
    "may come from @xmath160-cell , i.e. @xmath161 . since the average charge density @xmath162 , we obtain @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the averaged charge density without drift motion .",
    "it may be expected that displacement of the particles due to the drift motion becomes more important on the magnetic field line that has a smaller radial distance to the null charge surface , because the particles run longer distance in the outer gap , which is extending the null charge surface to the light cylinder . to take into account such effect",
    ", we may assume the formula of displacement as @xmath165 where @xmath166 is a fitting parameter , which is chosen as -28@xmath136 .",
    "we take @xmath167 for @xmath144 , because the null charge surface is close to the light cylinder , therefore particles from other cells can not drift in .",
    "the negative value ( that is , counter - direction of the rotation ) of the displacement may be expected because ( 1 ) more particles are concentrated around the upper part of the gap and ( 2 ) the direction of the non - corotational electric field @xmath168 is negative value at upper part of the gap , indicating the direction of the drift motion is counter direction of the rotation .",
    "using the relationship between @xmath115 , @xmath169 and @xmath116 given by equation  ( [ eqn9 ] ) and @xmath170/h_2 $ ] , the distribution of @xmath119 can be obtained .",
    "figure  [ edlc_rho ] is the energy dependent light curves calculated using the azimuthal distribution of @xmath119 , where @xmath116=0.927 and @xmath55=0.2 are the same with those of figure [ edlc_nd ] .",
    "compared with figure [ edlc_nd ] , it shows that the distribution of @xmath119 makes a third peak at the bridge region ( @xmath134 pulse phase ) when the energy@xmath171gev .",
    "this is due to the distribution of the number density in the main acceleration region , where the photons of @xmath1721 gev are emitted .",
    "figure  [ rho_phi ] shows the average charge density ( filled - circle ) and the resultant charge density in the main acceleration region ( circle ) .",
    "the average charge density and therefore the number density in the main acceleration region acquire the maximum vale at polar angle around 240@xmath136 , which corresponds to the pulse phase around 0.3 .",
    "we have discussed the effects of the distributions of @xmath55 , @xmath116 and @xmath119 on the shape of the energy dependent light curves . as discussed in section  [ gapthick ] , the distribution of thickness ratio @xmath116 mainly affects the light curve of @xmath152  gev energy bands , and it makes a bump at pulse phase around 0.25 in the light curve below 1  gev .",
    "the shape of bridge emission in the light curves above 1  gev are mainly affected by the azimuthal distributions of the fractional thickness @xmath55 and of the number density @xmath119 .",
    "we demonstrated the third - peak - like structure can be produced by the azimuthal structure of @xmath55 , @xmath116 and @xmath119 .",
    "figure  [ edlc_3dis ] shows the pulsed profiles calculated by taking into account the azimuthal distributions for all @xmath55 , @xmath116 and @xmath119 .",
    "we can see in figure  [ edlc_3dis ] that there is a bump at the trailing part of the first peak in the pulse profile below 1  gev , and it shifts towards the second peak in higher energy bands .",
    "figure  [ colmap ] is the intensity map in the pulse phase and the energy plane .",
    "the darkness represents the number of the photons at the certain interval of the pulse phase .",
    "it shows that the third peak in the bridge region shifts towards the second peak as increases of the photon energy .",
    "the reason for the shift of the third peak is explained as follows . in the light curves in the energy bands",
    "lower than 1  gev , the distributions of the thickness ratio @xmath116 makes a third - peak structure at @xmath173 pulse phase . in the energy bands higher than 1  gev , on the other hand , the azimuthal distribution of the fractional thickness , @xmath55 , and the number density , @xmath119 , is more important , and they produce the third peak at @xmath174 pulse phase .",
    "consequently , the differences in the standing phases of the third peak due to the distributions of @xmath116 and @xmath55 ( or @xmath119 ) produce the shift of the third peak with the photon energy .    here",
    "the distribution of the polar radius @xmath135 , position of null charge surface @xmath153 , which determine the distribution of @xmath119 , @xmath116 and @xmath55 , depend on the inclination angle @xmath104 .",
    "for instance , if the inclination angle is small , such as 10@xmath136 , the shape of the polar cap is close to a circle , then the @xmath135 of different polar angles are nearly a same value , the third peak made by it is not obvious . on the other hand",
    ", if the inclination angle is getting larger , the third peak made by the distribution of @xmath55 is getting more obvious . in order to provide appropriate distributions of the three parameters , we use inclination angle @xmath124 and viewing angle @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath0 @xmath1-ray telescope have measured the @xmath1-ray emissions from about 60 pulsars .",
    "however , the vela pulsar is the only one showing the shifting third peak with energy .",
    "this may be because the vela pulsar is relatively young and its gap thickness is smaller than other mature pulsars . for mature pulsars ( e.g. the geminga )",
    ", the gap thickness will be much thicker ( @xmath175 ) than that ( @xmath176 ) of the vela pulsar .",
    "in such a thick gap , the emissions from the different regions in the gap may smear out the effects of azimuthal structure of the gap . for the crab pulsar ,",
    "the gap thickness @xmath177 is smaller than that of the vela pulsar .",
    "however , the contributions of the inverse - compton scattering from the secondary pairs , which are produced outside of the gap , dominates the emissions in @xmath1-ray energy bands ( tang et al .",
    "this may be the reason that no third peak is observed in the light curves of the crab pulsar .",
    "the spectral characteristics are summarized in figures  [ spec_3dis]-[gamma_phi ] .",
    "figures  [ spec_3dis ] and  [ spec_pr ] compare the calculated ( solid lines ) and observed ( filled - circles ) phase - averaged and phase - resolved spectra , respectively . by fitting calculated spectra with power law plus exponential cut - off form",
    ", figures  [ ecut_phi ] and  [ gamma_phi ] show the cut - off energy and the photon index , respectively , as a function of the pulse phase .    as we can see from figure  [ ecut_phi ] , the present model can explain the observed cut - off energy as a function of the pulse phase .",
    "this can be explained as the effect of the distribution of the @xmath55 , which decides the energies of the photons in the gap by determining the value of the accelerating electric field . and the cut - off energy of the spectrum is mainly determined by the emission from the main acceleration region . from figure  [ rp_phi ] , in the observable region from around 0@xmath136 to 260@xmath136 , there are three peaks of @xmath55 , which correspond to the three peaks in figure  [ ecut_phi ] .",
    "and the pulse phase of the middle peak in figure  [ ecut_phi ] is consistent with that of the third peak in the light curve made by the distribution of @xmath55 .",
    "these two facts indicate that the distribution of @xmath55 makes the calculated cut - off energies of the phase - resolved spectra consistent with the observed one .",
    "because the photon index is much more sensitive to the shape of the spectrum than the cut - off energy , the figure  [ gamma_phi ] is not so consistent with the observation , where the photon indices between pulse phase of 0.3 to 0.5 are different with the observed ones .",
    "as the spectrum of @xmath178 in figure  [ spec_pr ] shows , the present model predicts a larger photon index at the pulse phase of 0.3 - 0.4 than the observations . for the pulse phase=0.4 to 0.5 , as we can see from the energy dependent light curves ( figure  [ edlc_3dis ] ) , the calculated photons are more than those of the observation .",
    "consequently , the calculated curvature radiation from the main acceleration region is too strong , leading the calculated spectrum is hard with a photon index @xmath179 . for the other pulse phases , as shown by the figure  [ spec_pr ] , the flux and the shape of the spectra are close to the observed ones , and the photon indices of these pulse phases can also explain the observed ones .",
    "in this paper , a three dimensional outer gap model is built to explain the energy dependent light curves of the vela pulsar observed by @xmath0 lat ( abdo et al . , 2010b ) .",
    "in the present two - layer model , the acceleration and emission region in the gap consist two parts , that is , the main acceleration region and the screening region . in the main acceleration region ,",
    "the charge density is much lower than the goldreich - julian charge density and a strong electric field accelerates the particles to emit gev photons via the curvature radiation process . in the screening region ,",
    "the charge density is higher than the goldreich - julian charge density to screen out the accelerating electric field .",
    "we extend our two - dimensional two - layer model in wang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) into a three - dimensional one with the azimuthal structure of the fractional gap thickness ( @xmath55 ) , ratio of the thicknesses of the primary and whole region ( @xmath116 ) , and the number density in the main acceleration region @xmath180 .",
    "using constant @xmath119 , @xmath116 and @xmath55 , although the calculated light curves can qualitatively explain the observations of the vela pulsar , the energy dependent light curves can not have the third peak .",
    "therefore , we considered the possible azimuthal distributions of these three parameters .",
    "we found that the distributions of @xmath119 and @xmath55 make third - peak - like structure in the bridge region of light curve of above 1  gev , while the distribution of @xmath116 makes a bump in the bridge region of the light curves below 1  gev .",
    "we find that the phases of the third peaks caused by the azimuthal distributions of @xmath116 , @xmath119 and @xmath55 are different from each other .",
    "consequently , the difference in the phases produces the shift of the combined third peak with the photon energy .",
    "we also showed that the present model can reproduce the distribution of the cut - off energy for each rotation phase .",
