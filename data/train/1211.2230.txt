    "we find that a flat prior comes much closer to accurately representing the relative surface densities of these two populations .      while the sources in our current selection are consistent with being @xmath0 galaxies , these sources are faint enough that they could easily have a very different nature .",

    "readers are referred to bouwens et al .",
    "( 2011a ) , z12 , and c13 for rather extended discussions of these issues .    in general , the most important source of contamination for high - redshift samples results from faint balmer - break galaxies entering these samples ( and hence satisfying their selection criteria ) due to the effects of noise ( see discussion in wilkins et al .",

    "this being said , it is worth noting that our estimate of the total contamination here may be a little high ( perhaps by a factor of @xmath22 - 3 ) , due to our use of an intermediate magnitude ( @xmath224.0 - 25.5 mag ) population of galaxies to model the colors of somewhat fainter galaxies ( i.e. , 26.0 - 27.0 mag ) . since the intermediate magnitude population are somewhat redder in general than @xmath226.0 - 27.0 mag population ( e.g. , see figure 11 of oesch et al .",

    "one final possibility is that some candidates may correspond to more local solar system or oort cloud objects . to be consistent with the constraints we can set on the proper motion of our candidates based on the @xmath22 month observational baseline we have ( see figure 6 of c13 for an illustration of the constraints we can set ) ,",
    "such a source would need to be at 50,000 au .",
    "however , at such distances , oort cloud objects would be extremely faint ( e.g. , faintward of 40 mag ) , even if as these sources were as large as the moon ( see also discussion in z12 and c13 ) .",
    "the present @xmath0 sample is the largest such sample available to date and should allow us to substantially improve our constraints on the @xmath0 luminosity function .",
    "however , before providing a detailed discussion of the specific constraints we are able to set , we must first include a few words on the procedure we adopt .",
    "normally , we would derive the luminosity function for @xmath0 galaxies using the same approach that has been followed in the field , i.e. , ( 1 ) distribute the sources in one s samples into different magnitude intervals , ( 2 ) count the total number of sources in a magnitude interval ( after correcting for contamination ) and ( 3 ) divide these numbers by the effective volume where such sources could be found .",
    "such a procedure has been followed in a number of previous works ( e.g. , santos et al .",
    "2004 ; richard et al .",

    "while in many cases these model dependencies may not result in large overall uncertainties in one s results , the uncertainties clearly do become large ( @xmath20.3 - 0.4 mag or larger ) near the critical curves of the lensing models where the magnification factors become nominally infinite ( e.g. , see figure 2 of maizy et al .",
    "these issues can potentially have a huge effect on luminosity functions derived in the context of lensing clusters .",
    ", uncertainties in the magnification factor trade off almost perfectly with uncertainties in the search volume so as to have no large effect on the inferred lfs . because of this fact",
    ", one potentially very effective approach for minimizing the impact these uncertainties on the derived lfs is by marginalizing over the magnification factor in performing the comparisons with the observed numbers ( c13 ) .",

    "one possible way for us to do this is ( 1 ) to leverage existing well - determined lfs that already exist at @xmath13 - 8 from blank field studies ( e.g. , bouwens et al .  2011b ; oesch et al .  2012b ; bradley et al .  2012 ) not subject to potentially large selection volume uncertainties and ( 2 ) then to use our searches for @xmath13 - 10 galaxies behind lensing clusters to derive the differential evolution in the lf from @xmath0 to @xmath13 - 8 .",
    "this provides us with a somewhat indirect approach to deriving the lf at @xmath0 and takes advantage of the very similar effect gravitational lensing from low - redshift clusters has on light from the high - redshift universe , regardless of the exact redshift of the source .",
    "fundamentally , this is due to the fact that the @xmath137 factor is very insensitive to redshift when the lensed source is at @xmath138 ( i.e. , very distant ) and the lensing cluster is relatively close ( i.e. , @xmath139 - 0.5 ) . for example , for a @xmath140 lensing cluster ,",
    "the computed @xmath141 factor for @xmath0 background sources is only @xmath21% higher than the @xmath141 factor for @xmath4 sources . @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the angular - diameter distances from the cluster lens to source and from observer to source , respectively ( e.g. , narayan & bartelmann 1996 ) .    as a result , for sources seen behind a given lensing cluster",
    ", the @xmath4 universe is magnified in almost exactly the same way as the @xmath0 universe .",

    "note that this is true , even if the precise position of the critical curves at @xmath0 lies in a slightly different position from the critical curves at e.g. @xmath4 .",
    "because of the very similar way a given set of clusters magnifies galaxies at @xmath0 and at other similar redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath4 ) , one might expect it to have the same effect on the total surface densities of these galaxies one finds on the sky .",
    "therefore , if one starts with the same luminosity function of galaxies at both @xmath4 and @xmath0 , one would expect to find roughly the same surface density of these galaxies on the sky , modulo two slight differences .",
    "the @xmath0 galaxy distribution would be shifted to slightly fainter magnitudes ( e.g. , by @xmath20.3 mag versus @xmath4 ) to reflect their slightly larger luminosity distances and would be present at slightly lower surface densities ( by @xmath210% versus @xmath4 ) reflecting the smaller cosmic volume available at @xmath0",
    ".    even multiple imaging of the same high - redshift sources would not appreciably affect the ratio of sources seen at different redshifts , since one would expect galaxies at @xmath0 and similar redshifts to give rise to lensed multiplets to approximately the same degree , and therefore the ratio of surface densities should be preserved .",
    "however , since multiple images of a single background source are not independent events , not accounting for this effect could have a slight effect on the uncertainties we estimate for the relative surface densities of galaxies at different redshifts .",

    "we find that @xmath148 for the @xmath0 lf is just @xmath5 the equivalent @xmath148 at @xmath4 (  4.4 : keeping @xmath144 and @xmath145 fixed ) .",
    "we would have expected the normalization @xmath148 of the lf at @xmath0 to be just @xmath214 that at @xmath4 , if the evolution in the @xmath9 lf proceeded at the same rate as seen at @xmath8 - 8 .",
    "while the present result is consistent with there being no significant change in the rate of evolution of the @xmath9 lf from @xmath0 to @xmath8 , our result does favor slightly more rapid evolution of the lf at @xmath10 , as suggested by oesch et al .",

    "support the idea that the @xmath9 lf may evolve faster at @xmath10 as a function of redshift than at @xmath8 - 8 ( see figure 8 of oesch et al .",

    "( 2014 ) , the uncertainties on the evolution of the lf at @xmath10 are still somewhat large .    in the future , we expect further advances in our constraints on the @xmath9 lf at @xmath95 from the frontier fields program ( lotz et al .",
    "2014)@xmath216 , pointing follow - up observations of @xmath0 - 10 candidates over candels ( go 13792 : pi bouwens ) , and the new wide - area borg program ( go 13767 : pi trenti ) . substantially deeper spitzer observations over the clash clusters , as part of the surf s up program ( bradac et al .",

    "in  3.4 , we present redshift likelihood distributions for the three candidate @xmath0 galaxies in our selection .",
    "this allows us to estimate the relative probability that sources in this sample correspond to higher or lower redshift galaxies ( figure  [ fig : seds ] ) .",
    "however , in doing so , we must utilize a prior .",
    "we consider three different redshift priors : ( 1 ) a flat redshift - independent prior , ( 2 ) a prior calibrated to published lf or lf trends , and ( 3 ) a prior tuned to reproduce the results from our photometric scattering experiments (  3.5 ) .",
    "this section discusses the latter two priors in detail .",
    "_ lf - calibrated prior : _ the second prior we consider is calibrated according to published lfs or lf trends . for this",
    "prior , we give special attention to two galaxy populations : star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 and faint red galaxies at @xmath100 - 2 .",
    "these are the only two galaxy populations which can at least provide approximate fits to the sources in our selection and therefore have nominal @xmath52 s that are not especially large .",
    "for the faint red @xmath100 - 2 galaxy case , we calibrate our priors based on the lf results of giallongo et al .",

    ", their @xmath217 lf results correspond to @xmath218 mag , @xmath219 mpc@xmath165 mag@xmath220 , and @xmath221 .",
    "the basic validity of these lf results has been verified with much improved statistics based on new results for red galaxies over the ukidss ultra deep survey field ( lawrence et al .",
    "2007 ) where fits yield @xmath222 , @xmath219 mpc@xmath165 , and @xmath223 ( r. quadri et al .",

    "finally , for the @xmath0 star - forming galaxy case , our priors use the bouwens et al .",
    "( 2011b ) lf fitting formula as a guide ( which is a parameterization of the evolution of the @xmath9 lf from @xmath4 to @xmath8 : see  7.5 of that paper )",
    ".    assuming a deep blank search at @xmath228.5 mag ( the approximate intrinsic magnitude of our candidates after correction for magnification ) with a @xmath48 , @xmath226 selection window , we find that these lfs predict @xmath21.2 @xmath0 galaxies per arcmin@xmath227 , but 0.14 faint red galaxies per arcmin@xmath227 over the redshift range @xmath100 - 2.5 .",
    "surprisingly enough , these results suggest that we would be much more likely ( i.e. , by @xmath29@xmath7 ) to find a blue galaxy at @xmath0 with our selection than a faint red galaxy at @xmath100 - 2 . even correcting these predictions based on the present search results for @xmath0 galaxies ( where we find just @xmath255@xmath228% as many galaxies as expected from the bouwens et al .",
    "2011b fitting formula ) , @xmath0 galaxies would still be @xmath229 more abundant on the sky at @xmath230 mag than red ( old and/or dusty ) galaxies at @xmath100 - 2.5 . for the purposes of our `` lf calibrated '' prior , we will assume that @xmath0 galaxies have a @xmath229 higher surface density on the sky than @xmath100 - 2.5 red ( old and/or dusty ) galaxies .",
    "_ contamination - tuned prior : _ of course , it is not simply the faint red ( old and/or dusty ) galaxies at @xmath100 - 2 that can contaminate @xmath10 selections .",
    "other galaxies can scatter into @xmath0 selections through noise .",
    "this makes the low - redshift solution more likely than what we would calculate based on observationally - based lfs .",
    "considered by themselves , each photometrically - scattered source would be unlikely to look very much like a probable @xmath0 candidate , but one must account for the fact that there are some @xmath231 sources in our fields which noise could conspire to make look like such a @xmath0 - 10 candidate . we account for this possibility with our third `` contamination tuned '' prior . with this prior , we adjust the relative likelihood of the high and low redshift peaks for our entire three source @xmath0 - 10 galaxy sample so that it matches the 23% contamination rate estimated in our photometric scattering experiments described in  3.5 .. ] however , it is worth keeping in mind that results based on the third prior likely overweight the probability that sources are low - redshift contaminants .",
    "this is due to our photometric scatter simulations not accounting for the fact that red ( old and/or dusty ) galaxies are even rarer at @xmath227 - 28 mag than the @xmath224 - 25.5 magnitude sources we use as inputs to our photometric scattering simulations ( e.g. , figure 11 from oesch et al .",
    "in deriving the differential evolution in the @xmath9 lf from @xmath0 to @xmath4 , one particularly significant assumption we made in  4.2 was that the relative numbers of galaxies expected to be present in our @xmath0 and @xmath4 samples would remain roughly the same whether or not we included lensing in the simulations .    in this section ,",
    "we test the accuracy of this assumption by making use of four different gravitational lensing models and galaxy clusters from the clash program ( i.e. , macs1149 , macs1115 , macs1720 , and macs0416 ) when creating mock galaxy fields .",
    "we then create mock galaxy fields over the same cluster ignoring the lensing deflection fields . by comparing the relative number of @xmath4 and @xmath0 galaxies we select from the two simulations , we test the assumption we made in  4.2 of this paper .    in simulating the mock galaxy fields subject to lensing",
    ", we use exactly the same set of assumptions that we used for the simulations described in  4.2 . starting with the same ( and non - evolving ) lf of galaxies at @xmath4 and @xmath0",
    ", we construct a mock catalog of sources over multiple cluster fields .",
    "we then create artificial images of each sources by artificially redshifting similar luminosity @xmath8 galaxies from the hudf to higher redshift . while redshifting the sources , we scale their sizes as @xmath159 at fixed luminosity and take the @xmath9-continuum slope @xmath111 of galaxies in our simulations to have a mean value and @xmath60 scatter of @xmath161 and 0.45 , respectively , to match the observed trends extrapolated to @xmath4 - 9 .",
    "we remap the simulated images of galaxies in the source plane onto the image plane using the lensing models we have available for these clusters ( zitrin et al .",
    "we then added these simulated fields to the actual clash observations and attempted to recover the mock sources using the same @xmath4 and @xmath0 selection criteria as given in this paper .    in figure",
    "[ fig : wwolensing ] , we present the relative surface density of @xmath4 and @xmath0 galaxies we recover from non - evolving lf from our clash observations and compare with the surface density of galaxies we find without including lensing ( but assuming a uniform factor - of-9 magnification in the luminosity of all sources : see  4.2 ) .",
    "overall , we find that the ratio of galaxies we select in the two cases is similar , but not exactly the same .    in fact ,",
    "the relative numbers of @xmath0 galaxies to @xmath4 galaxies is slightly ( @xmath216% ) lower in simulations where we include the effect of lensing .",
    "we find similar results for all four cluster lensing models we have run simulations , but note that the relative numbers can show a dependence on the lfs or average magnification factors we assume ( @xmath210 - 20% ) .",
    "however , for all reasonable lf or magnification factors we consider , the relative numbers do not differ by @xmath23220% from the ratios we give here .",
    "in deriving the @xmath9 lf at @xmath0 from our clash search results (  4 ) , we make use of a baseline sample of @xmath4 candidate galaxies in clash that we contrast with a similar @xmath0 sample to establish the evolution from @xmath4 to @xmath0 .",
