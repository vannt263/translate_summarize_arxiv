    "sf is expected to heat up the molecular gas substantially .",
    "the resulting warm gas can be better traced by mid-@xmath0 co line transitions such as co(6@xmath15 ) , which has a critical density of @xmath173@xmath18@xmath19 and an excitation temperature of @xmath17116k ( carilli & walter 2013 ) , hinted already by limited ground - based co data ( e.g. , bayet et al .",

    "the program and observational data on individual galaxies will be given in full in a future paper ( lu et al 2014 ; in preparation ) .",
    "an earlier paper ( zhao et al .",
    "2013 ) presented the initial results on how the [ nii ]  205  line correlates with the sf rate . in this paper",
    "we report our initial findings on the observed co line emission for 65 sample galaxies from the _ early _ _ herschel _  observations .",
    "we provide a brief description of our survey program and data reduction in  2 , and present our results and discuss physical implications on gas and dust heating in  3 .",
    "our full fts sample is a flux - limited subset of the goals sample , which contains 202 lirgs down to @xmath20jy , by further satisfying @xmath21(8@xmath11000 ) @xmath22wm@xmath23 , where @xmath21 is as defined in sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) and the conversion between @xmath21 and @xmath7 used the luminosity distance given in table  1 in armus et al .",
    "galaxies in a pair were treated separately with their individual @xmath7 derived as in daz - santos et al .",
    "our fts sample contains 7 galaxies with @xmath24 .",
    "ninety - three galaxies were eventually observed by us ( program i d : ot1@xmath25nlu@xmath251 ) using the high resolution , sparse mode centered on each galaxy .",

    "the spire data were reduced homogeneously using _ herschel _ interactive processing environment ( hipe ) , version 9 ( ott 2010 ) , which offers a line flux accuracy better than 10% .",

    "1 shows the spectrum of _ iras_17578 - 0400 , a starburst with @xmath27 and _ iras _ 60-to-100  flux density ratio ( also referred to as fir color ) , @xmath28 , with the fitted co , [ ci ]  ad [ nii ]   lines marked .    , dec @xmath290053.3@xmath30 ; j2000 ) , a starburst with @xmath31 .",
    "the composite fit of the continuum and the selected lines in co , [ ci ]  and [ nii ]   ( see the text ) is shown in red .",
    "other detected molecular lines were not fit here , but marked in the residual spectrum ( in cyan ) . ]",
    "we used the spectrum fitter in hipe to simultaneously fit a polynomial ( of order 5 ) to the continuum and sinc functions in frequency to the targeted lines . for each sinc profile ,",
    "only its fwhm was fixed at 1.44ghz .",
    "a line was regarded as being detected if ( a ) the fitted line flux is greater than 3 times the r.m.s .",
    "noise , measured within a frequency interval of 20fwhm wide , centered on the line frequency in the residual spectrum , and ( b ) its inferred line velocity difference with the ( usually ) brightest [ nii ]  205  line is within the expected uncertainty based on the spectral resolution and data sampling frequency . the sinc line profiles were adequate for all the co lines detected in nearly all sources .",
    "the only clear exception was ngc6240 , for which the broad co lines are partially resolved and were fit with a gaussian convolved profile using the algorithm described in zhao et al .",
    "fig .  2 shows 9 examples of the observed co spectral line energy distributions ( sleds ) from our own observations , in order of increasing @xmath7 .",
    "these plots illustrate that @xmath7 is not the best predictor for the sled shapes .",
    "for example , cgcg448 - 020 and eso069-ig006 are similar in @xmath7 , but have very different co sleds : the sled of the former peaks at @xmath32 while that of the latter peaks at @xmath33 .",
    "this difference is mainly due to their different dust temperatures : @xmath34 for cgcg448 - 020 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath35 for eso069-ig006 . to show how @xmath6 , which measures the average intensity of the dust heating radiation field ( tuffs & popescu 2003 ) , correlates with the sled shape , we color - coded the sleds in fig .  2 on @xmath6 . almost all the red - colored sleds , with @xmath36 , peak at @xmath33 with the line fluxes decreasing rapidly as @xmath0 increases .",
    "in contrast , the blue - colored sleds , with @xmath37 , are dominated by a broad distribution over @xmath8 .",
    "this suggests that it is the intensity of the radiation field , rather than @xmath7 , which determines the sled shape .",
    "3 plots the logarithmic co line luminosity , normalized by @xmath7 , as a function of @xmath6 for co(4@xmath13 ) , co(6@xmath15 ) , co(7@xmath16 ) and co(12@xmath111 ) . an undetected co line is shown with its 3@xmath38 upper limit .",
    "the average fractional agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity , @xmath39 , has been derived for most of the goals galaxies .",
    "this was from a set of the mid - ir diagnostics based on [ nev]/[neii ] , [ oiv]/[neii ] , continuum slope , pah equivalent width and the diagram of laurent et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , following the prescriptions in armus et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( see also petric et al .  2011 ; stierwalt et al .  2013 ) . of the galaxies used here ,",
    "only two have @xmath40 ( i.e. , @xmath1756% for mrk231 and @xmath1760% for irasf05189 - 2524 ) .",
    "the remainder all have @xmath41 , including only 3 galaxies with @xmath39 between 30 and 40% , and are thus sf dominated . in fig .  3 ,",
    "the two galaxies with @xmath40 are further enclosed by a circle .",
    "all the plots in fig .  3 span 1.6 dex vertically so that the sample dispersions can be visually compared .",
    "the dotted line in each plot helps identifying the most energetic co line at any given @xmath6 by noticing that a galaxy lies on a vertical line across the plots .",
    "3 shows that as @xmath6 increases , the overall co gas gets warmer : the slope of the linear fit ( i.e. , the dashed line in each plot ) to the detections _ only _ ( but excluding the outlier ngc6240 ) increases monotonically from about -0.8 for co(4@xmath13 ) to + 0.7 for co(12@xmath111 ) . both plots of co(4@xmath13 ) and co(12@xmath111 ) contain quite a few upper limits .",
    "we performed two tests on whether the fitted slope could be substantially biased due to the non - detections : ( a ) a full regression including the upper limits based on a survival analysis outlined by isobe et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , and ( b ) using only the detections from the 27 galaxies with the more sensitive co data from the _ herschel _  archive , for which there are fewer upper limits .",
    "the results from both tests confirm , within the fit uncertainties , that the slopes derived from the fits to the detections are representative of the entire sample .    a more significant message from fig .",
    "3 is that the ratio of co(6@xmath15 ) or co(7@xmath16 ) to the ir emission is rather constant over the range of @xmath6 probed .",
    "this argues for at least two gas components : a warm component , which emits the co lines primarily in mid-@xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) and correlates best with the dust emission , is mainly responsible for the observed constant ratio seen around @xmath43 or 7 . since the dominant heating source for the ir emission is current sf",
    ", the same ongoing sf should be also responsible for this warm co gas component .",
    "the other component is a `` cold '' and predominantly less dense gas that emits co lines primarily at @xmath44 and is _ not directly _ related to current sf .",
    "as @xmath6 increases , the warm gas component becomes more energetic , resulting in the trend seen in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "as we argue in  3.2 , in galaxies with a prominent agn , there could also be a meaningful third component of hot and likely denser gas , which emits co lines primarily at @xmath45 and is thus not sampled adequately by the spire spectrometer .",
    ", as a function the fir color for our sample .",
    "the co transition is labelled in each plot .",
    "the two galaxies with energetic agns ( see the text ) are enclosed by circles .",
    "the arrows indicate the 3@xmath38 upper limits of an undetected line . in each plot , the dashed line is the least - squares fit to the detections only ( but excluding ngc6240 ) , of which the slope is given .",
    "the dotted line in each plot is fixed at @xmath46 . both ngc6240 and mrk231 are marked .",
    "note that some galaxies lack the co(4@xmath13 ) data due to redshift . ]",
    "various heating mechanisms have been considered in the literature for warm co line emission in galaxies , including far - uv photon heating from massive stars ( hereafter referred to as photon dominated region or pdr scenario ) ( e.g. , ic342 , rigopoulou et al .",
    "2013 ) , x - ray photon heating from agns ( referred to as x - ray dominated region or xdr scenario ) ( e.g. , mrk231 , van der werf et al . 2010",
    "; ngc1068 , spinoglio et al .",
    "2012 ) , heating by cosmic - rays enhanced from supernovae ( e.g. , ngc253 ; bradford et al .",
    "2003 ) , and interstellar shocks ( e.g. , flower & pineau des forts 2010 ) .",
    "the shock scenario has been favored in many cases , including m82 ( kamenetzky et al .",
    "2012 ) , arp220 ( rangwala et al .",
    "2011 ) , ngc891 ( nikola et al .",
    "2011 ) , ngc  253 ( rosenberg et al .",
    "2014 ) , ngc6240 ( meijerink et al .",
    "2013 ) , and ngc1266 ( pellegrini et al .",
    "2013 ) . in this paper",
    ", we further divide the shock scenario into two categories : ( a ) shocks associated with processes derived from current sf , such as supernovae and stellar winds ; and ( b ) shocks that derive from energy sources other than current sf , such as those associated with agn - driven gas outflows , radio jets , or galaxy - galaxy collision .",
    "while studies of xdr point to co sleds peaking well beyond mid-@xmath0 ( e.g. , spaans & meijerink  2008 ) , all the other heating mechanisms can , in principle , produce similar co sleds within the mid-@xmath0 regime , making them difficult to be differentiated based on spire co data alone .    in fig .  4",
    ", we sum over the mid-@xmath0 co lines of @xmath47 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 10 , and plot in log the resulting luminosity to @xmath7 ratio , @xmath12 , as a function of @xmath6 . [ the co(9@xmath18 ) line",
    "was left out because the fts spectra are usually noisier around its frequency . ]",
    "our sample galaxies are in solid or open squares , with the latter representing those with one or more of the co lines undetected . for these galaxies",
    ", we present the possible range for @xmath12 between the 0 and 3@xmath38 values for the undetected lines . in most of these cases",
    ", the actual ratio should be much closer to the upper end of the range as most of the undetected lines in the mid-@xmath0 regime have a fitted line flux not far below the 3@xmath38 threshold .",
    "overall , @xmath12 shows little systematic dependence on @xmath6 , except for ( i ) @xmath48 , where more data points ( e.g. , mrk231 ) tend to lie below the sample mean , and ( ii ) the clear outlier ngc6240 . as comparison cases ,",
    "we also plot in fig .",
    "4 four additional galaxies indicated by crosses .",
    "three are from the references listed above : m82 , an archetypical starburst ; ngc1266 , a disk galaxy with possible agn - driven molecular outflows ( alatalo et al .",
    "2011 ) ; and ngc1068 , a well - known seyfert galaxy with its co line emission detected up to @xmath49 ( hailey - dunsheath et al .",
    "2012 ) and @xmath50 ( telesco & decher  1988 ) .",
    "m82 is slightly extended and its @xmath7 used here was limited to within the same beam size as for the co sled .",
    "the fourth object is 3c293 , a radio galaxy rich in warm h@xmath51 , possibly excited by radio jet - driven shocks ( ogle et al .",
    "2010 ) . from the archival spire spectrum of 3c293 ( obs .",
    "i d : 1342238242 ; pi : p. papadopoulos ) , we derived the fluxes of 1.69 , 2.91 and 2.14@xmath52 wm@xmath23 for co(6@xmath15 ) , co(7@xmath16 ) and co(8@xmath17 ) , respectively , all at s / n @xmath53 , but only the 3@xmath38 upper limits of 5.49 and 3.15@xmath54 wm@xmath23 for co(5@xmath14 ) and co(10@xmath19 ) , respectively .",
    "its @xmath55 wm@xmath23 , based on an 12  flux from siebenmorgen et al .  ( 2004 ) and _ iras _ flux densities at 25 , 60 and 100  from golombek , miley & beugebauer  ( 1988 ) .",
    "the galaxy 3c293 is shown in fig .  4 by its possible range in @xmath12 .",
    "in both ngc1266 and 3c293 , our estimated @xmath56 , based on [ oiv]/[neii ] from dudik , satyapal & marcu ( 2009 ) or ogle et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .    the relatively small sample scatter in fig",
    ".  4 for the sf - dominated lirgs ( except for ngc6240 ) suggests convincingly that the current sf is also the main heating source for the mid-@xmath0 co line emission .",
    "if we exclude ngc6240 on one side of the main locus and the two agns from our sample on the other side , the average and sample standard deviation of @xmath9 from the remaining detections in our _ own sample _ are @xmath10 ( @xmath57 ; i.e. , the dashed line in fig .  4 ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ; marked by the two dotted lines in fig .  4 ) , respectively .",
    "ngc6240 has @xmath60 , which is @xmath178@xmath61 above @xmath62 .",
    "the starburst superwinds in ngc6240 are believed to power the large - scale diffuse ionized gas ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1987 ) and shock - excited h@xmath63 line emission ( e.g. , max et al .",
    "it is not clear how a category - a shock case can lead to such a high @xmath12 .",
    "the energy output of stellar winds should scale in certain way with that of the far - uv photons powering @xmath7 , resulting in @xmath12 around some characteristic value .",
    "indeed , all the other superwind galaxies ( e.g. , arp220 and m82 ) show a `` normal '' @xmath12 .",
    "the fact that no galaxies are seen at intermediate @xmath12 values argues against the hypothesis that ngc6240 represents an optimal wind - gas coupling efficiency .",
    "therefore , we can not rule out the possibility that some forms of category - b shocks might also be at work in the nuclear region of ngc6240 , where the gas is highly turbulent ( tacconi et al .  1999 ) and the heating source of the warm h@xmath51 emission is still controversial , with arguments for ( e.g. , ohyama et al .  2000 ) and against ( e.g. , feruglio et al .",
    "2013 ) a superwind case .",
    "a category - b shock scenario can in principle explain a higher @xmath12 as there is little far - uv counterpart .",
    "indeed , both ngc1266 and 3c293 , where the warm co emission might be enhanced respectively by the agn- and radio jet - driven shocks , show a higher @xmath12 in fig .  4 .",
    "on the other hand , both mrk231 and ngc1068 have a lower @xmath12 in fig .",
    "they both have significant hot co gas emitting at @xmath32 ( gonzlez - alfonso et al .",
    "2014 ; hailey - dunsheath et al .",
    "2012 ) , likely associated with xdr ( van der werf et al .  2010 ; spinoglio et al .",
    "2012 ) . furthermore , the model prediction that the xdr - associated co emission occurs mainly at higher @xmath0 levels is also supported by the observation that , with comparable @xmath6 , m82 and mrk231 have almost identical co sleds for @xmath64 ( pereira - santaella et al .",
    "these results suggest that an @xmath12 significantly lower than @xmath13 may be a result of missing most of the xdr - associated co line cooling at @xmath32 . however , not all the galaxies with a lower co / ir ratio in fig .",
    "4 have a powerful agn .",
    "one marked example is cgcg448 - 020 , of which @xmath7 is dominated by an extremely compact , extranuclear starburst ( inami et al .  2010 ) .",
    "this might hint that a lower @xmath12 could also be associated with some rare , extreme starbursts as a large - scale version of those galactic extreme compact molecular cores where the co line emission peaks at @xmath65 ( etxaluze et al .",
    "2013 ; habart et al .",
    "2010 ) .    under the assumption that agn / xdr results in co line emissions mainly at @xmath32 , one can use fig .  4 to estimate the fractional agn contribution to @xmath7 in an agn where no significant category - b shock is present : the measured @xmath66 $ ] , where @xmath67 is the agn component of @xmath7",
    "for example , the observed @xmath9 of @xmath68 for mrk231 implies that @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , in good agreement with @xmath71 from our mid - ir diagnostics . in the case of ngc1068",
    ", we have @xmath72 ( @xmath70 ) , in good agreement with an independent estimate in telesco & decher  ( 1988 ) .    in summary , ( 1 ) we demonstrated that the sf - dominated lirgs show a relatively tight distribution in terms of @xmath9 , with a mean of @xmath10 and a sample standard deviation of @xmath58 ; and ( 2 ) we showed , albeit with small number of cases , the possibility that ( a ) galaxies bearing powerful interstellar shocks not associated with current sf and ( b ) galaxies with a significant agn contribution to their bolometric luminosity , have their @xmath9 higher and lower than @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "while it is rather conclusive that the heating source of the mid-@xmath0 co line emission in most lirgs is current sf , more work needs to be done to clarify which sf - related mechanisms are directly responsible for the warm co line emission .",

    "<S> we present our initial results on the co rotational spectral line energy distribution ( sled ) of the @xmath0 to @xmath0@xmath11 transitions from @xmath2 up to @xmath3 from _ herschel _  spire spectroscopic observations of 65 luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) in the great observatories all - sky lirg survey ( goals ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed sleds change on average from one peaking at @xmath4 to a broad distribution peaking around @xmath56@xmath17 as the _ iras _ </S>",
    "<S> 60-to-100  color , @xmath6 , increases . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ratios of a co line luminosity to the total infrared luminosity , @xmath7 , show the smallest variation for @xmath0 around 6 or 7 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that , for most lirgs , ongoing star formation ( sf ) is also responsible for a warm gas component that emits co lines primarily in the mid-@xmath0 regime ( @xmath8 ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the logarithmic ratios of the co line luminosity summed over co(5@xmath14 ) , ( 6@xmath15 ) , ( 7@xmath16 ) , ( 8@xmath17 ) and ( 10@xmath19 ) transitions to @xmath7 , @xmath9 , remain largely independent of @xmath6 , and show a mean value of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and a sample standard deviation of only 0.10 for the sf - dominated galaxies . including additional galaxies from the literature , we show , albeit with small number of cases , the possibility that galaxies , which bear powerful interstellar shocks unrelated to the current sf , and galaxies , in which an energetic active galactic nucleus contributes significantly to the bolometric luminosity , have their @xmath12 higher and lower than @xmath13 , respectively . </S>"
