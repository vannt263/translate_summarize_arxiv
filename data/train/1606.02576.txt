    "over the last decade , due to advances@xcite in the control of ultra - cold atomic systems the experimental realisation of sudden quantum quenches@xcite has become possible . hereby a quantum system",
    "is prepared in an initial state , say the ground state of an hamiltonian @xmath0 , and then its time evolution after switching to another hamiltonian @xmath1 , eg , obtained by suddenly switching one of the system parameters of @xmath0 , is studied .",
    "generically the initial state will have a highly non - trivial representation in terms of the eigenstates of @xmath1 , thus resulting in a complicated relaxation of observables after the quench .",
    "these experimental advances have triggered tremendous theoretical efforts@xcite to understand the quench dynamics of a vast class of systems covering all spatial dimensions .",
    "of particular interest have been one - dimensional systems , due to the availability of powerful numerical and analytical tools as well as their relation to topics like integrability .",
    "arguably the most generic one - dimensional system is the luttinger liquid@xcite which is known to describe the low - energy properties of gapless systems like quantum wires , spin chains or bosonic atoms in one - dimensional optical lattices .",
    "the importance of luttinger liquids motivated the detailed investigation@xcite of its relaxation dynamics after sudden quantum quenches .    while the vast majority of previous works focused on sudden quantum quenches",
    ", we will here consider more general quenches of finite length @xmath2 over which the system parameters vary ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nonsudden ] for a sketch ) .",
    "physically the finite quench time @xmath2 ( depending on the precise form of the quench protocol one may even introduce several time scales @xmath3 ) introduces an additional energy scale @xmath4 , which is obviously trivial in the sudden and adiabatic limit .",
    "this newly generated energy scale is directly related to the quench protocol , ie , the switching process , and thus can be tuned .",
    "in particular , it can be made comparable to the other energy scales in the system like the band width , excitations gaps or relaxation rates .",
    "the interplay of these different energy scales originating in the properties of the post - quench hamiltonian , the initial state and the quench protocol opens the possibility to study emergent quantum states beyond the ones accessible via sudden quench protocols .",
    "an example of such an emergent state is generated by the periodic quench discussed below .",
    "several aspects of finite - time quenches and the interpolation between the sudden and adiabatic limit have been studied.@xcite for the luttinger liquid dora et al.@xcite first considered linear quench protocols .",
    "they obtained perturbative results for the total energy and fermionic chiral green function , which were later extended to spin - spin correlation functions and compared with numerical simulations of the time evolution during the quench in the xxz heisenberg chain.@xcite bernier et al.@xcite went beyond the perturbative treatment by deriving exact results for the time evolution during linear quenches in terms of bessel functions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] ) .",
    "this enabled them to analyse the properties of the bosonic green function in great detail , including the derivation of power laws governing the propagation of the light cone during the quench .",
    "the obtained results were further confirmed by numerical simulations for the bose  hubbard model .",
    "further aspects that were investigated include the excitation energy , the work statistics , finite - temperature initial states , the loschmidt echo and the diagonal ensemble reached at late times.@xcite    in this article we aim at obtaining a complete understanding of finite - time quenches in luttinger liquids . to this end",
    "we consider the time evolution during and after the quench and derive exact , analytical results to go beyond the perturbative regime .",
    "this allows us to study the interplay between the quench time @xmath2 and other energy scales in the system , resulting for example in a non - trivial dependence of the total energy on the quench time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : etot ] ) .",
    "both the fermionic and bosonic green function exhibit a clear light - cone effect after the quench , which is due to the propagation of entangled pairs of quasiparticles.@xcite however , as compared to the sudden quench the light cone lags behind ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gfcontour1 ] ) , which can be associated with a combination of two effects : first , during the quench the quasiparticles propagate at the instantaneous velocity , which is generically smaller than the velocity after the quench .",
    "second , the creation of the quasiparticles is spread over the whole quench duration , while in the sudden case all quasiparticles are created at @xmath5 . for short to moderate lengths of the quench",
    "we obtain an analytic result for the observed lag , linking it to the integrated change in the coupling during the quench [ see eq .  ] .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we define the tomonaga  luttinger model ( tlm ) and discuss its relation to microscopic fermionic and bosonic systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quenches ] we present the general approach to the problem of time - dependent interaction quenches in the tlm , and derive some universal properties of the solutions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exact ] we present exact analytic results for several quench protocols including the linear ramp , the smooth cosine quench and periodic quenches with arbitrary number of oscillations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we analyse the behaviour of the total and kinetic energies as well as the fermionic and bosonic green functions , both during and after the quench .",

    "we assume that @xmath23 and @xmath24 depend on the momentum in the dimensionless combination @xmath25 and fall off to zero at @xmath26 .",
    "thus the scale @xmath27 provides an ultra - violet cutoff for the theory .",
    "furthermore , we require the limits @xmath28 to be smooth , corresponding to systems with interactions of finite range in real space .",
    "apart from this the momentum dependence is kept arbitrary .",
    "in fact , it can be shown@xcite that in equilibrium the momentum dependence of @xmath23 and @xmath24 is irrelevant in a renormalisation - group sense , ie , the behaviour at low energies and long wave lengths is governed solely by their values at @xmath29 through the luttinger - liquid parameter and the renormalised velocity given by @xmath30 for non - interacting systems , @xmath31 , this simplifies to @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in general , if the system possesses galilean invariance the product @xmath34 is independent of the interaction parameters,@xcite implying in turn @xmath35 .    throughout this article",
    "we focus on universal quantities in the sense that they only depend on @xmath36 and @xmath37 and thus the luttinger parameter @xmath38 and the renormalised velocity @xmath39 given in .",

    "one can introduce phase fields corresponding to collective excitations in the electronic liquid via@xcite @xmath55 where the klein factor @xmath56 lowers the fermion number by one and commutes with the bosonic modes .",
    "the relation between the microscopic parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the lattice model and the effective parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the tlm is exactly known@xcite from the bethe - ansatz solution of @xmath59 we note that the relation between the microscopic and effective parameters is non - linear , implying , for example , that linear time dependences of the former will lead to non - linear quench protocols for the latter .",
    "the time evolution of the kinetic energy and fermionic quasiparticle weight ( see sec.s  [ sec : kineticenergy ] and  [ sec : gf ] below ) as well as local densities after a sudden interaction quench in the lattice model have been analysed@xcite in the framework of the tlm .    since one - dimensional spin models like the xxz heisenberg chain",
