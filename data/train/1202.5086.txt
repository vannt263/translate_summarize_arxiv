    "physics related to the crossover from bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid of fermi - pairs to the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of molecular dimers in ultracold fermi gas ( fg ) has become a central topic in both experimental@xcite@xcite@xcitezwierlein2 and theoretical@xcite communities .",

    "it has been demonstrated that there exist various phenomena , such as the sarma superfluidity@xcite with unmatched fermi surfaces and phase separation between paired - superfluid and excess - normal fermions depending on the population imbalance * *  * * in the 3d resulted from the unequal chemical - potentials and masses . * *  * * the sarma phase stands for a shell structure of the fg in which the core region is superfluid , while the outer region is normal@xcite .",
    "the phase separation refers generally to the spatial separation of unpaired fermions from a bcs superfluid of equal densities because of the existence of pairing gap in the superfluid region@xcite .",

    "2d fg possess a great advantage that the variation of bound - state energy in 2d is more suitable to display the bcs - bec crossover than the interaction strength in the 3d , where a critical coupling strength is required to form a s - wave bound state@xcite@xcite**. * * both the energy - gap order - parameter , condensate density and population imbalance can be expressed as a function of binding energy and the phase boundary between * *  * * normal and sarma phases is identified in the bcs - bec crossover@xcite    the three - component fg have been investigated in 2d@xciteluca1@xcite and 3d@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite free - spaces respectively showing the asymmetry of phase diagram by the unequal interaction lengths@xcite .",
    "however , the asymmetry is not only induced by the unequal physical quantities but also by the pairing itself between different components even in a homogeneous system , which leads to population imbalance .",
    "it is demonstrated that for a homogeneous * *  * * three - component ultracold fg with a @xmath1-invariant attractive interaction , the system exhibits population imbalance in the crossover , which connects the bcs regime of pairing state and the bec limit with three species of molecules , since the paring breaks @xmath1 symmetry**. * * the spontaneous population imbalance , first noted in ref . @xcite is an important feature of the three - component system",

    "the three - component superfluidity has been realized already by the lowest three hyperfine spin - states in the mixture of @xmath3li atoms and , moreover , * *  * * the experimental analysis of the condensate fraction of ultracold two - component fg in the bcs - bec crossover is shown to be in good agreement with the mean - field theoretical predictions@xcite@xcite and monte carlo simulations@xcite .    in a most recent paper@xcite@xcite the analytical formulas of number densities and condensate fraction for homogeneous three - component fg of both 3d and 2d",
    "are obtained in the bcs - bec crossover in which , although the third component is assumed not to have interaction with the other two components the asymmetric interactions affect the formation of condensation and lead to the population imbalance@xcite@xcite .",
