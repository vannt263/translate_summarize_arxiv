    "the recent results from the @xmath6 disappearance experiments @xcite have made important contributions toward pinning down the elements of the neutrino mixing ( pmns ) matrix , which we will denote as @xmath7 , with elements @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 . of the four physical parameters in @xmath7 , three have now been measured , albeit with different degrees of accuracy . furthermore , some information on the fourth can already be gleaned from the known data set obtained by the various extant experiments , as was done in global analyses thereof ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "it seems timely to study the available results in detail , with the intent to extract some general properties of @xmath7 which may be used to suggest directions for further investigation .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on two aspects of @xmath7 .",
    "first , it is interesting to assess the impact of the known results on the possible symmetry properties of @xmath7 . next , we address the behaviour of @xmath7 as a function of the parameter @xmath11 , the induced neutrino mass in matter .",
    "this is especially relevant to the long baseline experiments ( lbl ) ( for an incomplete list , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref.@xcite and the references therein ) , which are generally regarded as the `` future '' of neutrino physics explorations .",
    "the analyses of these issues are facilitated by a judicious choice of parameters for @xmath7 .",
    "to begin , in this study we will use the rephasing invariant parametrization introduced earlier .",
    "it consists of six parameters @xmath12 , which satisfy two constraints .",
    "prior to the recent measurement on @xmath13 , which results in a `` large '' @xmath14 , it seems probable that @xmath7 is @xmath4 symmetric @xcite , @xmath15 . these conditions ,",
    "when expressed in the variables @xmath16 , are just @xmath17 .",
    "now that @xmath14 is non - vanishing , exact @xmath4 symmetry becomes less likely .",
    "the question remains : `` is there an approximate @xmath4 symmetry , and how good is it ? '' .",
    "it seems natural , then , to interpret @xmath2 as the @xmath4 symmetry - breaking parameters .",
    "as we shall see , they satisfy a constraint and thus there are only two independent parameters in the set @xmath2 .",
    "also , taken together , the known neutrino data actually constrain all the @xmath2 s so that none of which deviate much from zero .",
    "the other physical parameters we choose are @xmath18 .",
    "as we shall see , the set @xmath19 is convenient for studying @xmath7 , in vacuum as well as in matter .    for neutrino propagation in matter",
    ", it turns out that @xmath0 , together with @xmath20 , satisfy a set of differential equations with respect to @xmath21 , the induced mass .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath0 s and @xmath22 s are all very well measured in vacuum @xmath23 .",
    "this means that @xmath0 and @xmath22 are well determined , for all values of @xmath21 . separately ,",
    "@xmath2 satisfy a set of differential equations containing @xmath0 and @xmath22",
    ". they can be integrated to obtain @xmath24 , with the known solution of @xmath25 as inputs . here , however ,",
    "the initial values are poorly determined since there is only one direct measurement ( from atmospheric neutrinos ) on @xmath26 , with large errors .",
    "nevertheless , it will be seen that the @xmath24 s are largely constrained .    to go forward",
    ", our analysis suggests that the most urgent task would be another independent measurement on @xmath2",
    ". it will clarify the nature of @xmath7 to a large extent . at the same time",
    ", the close correlation between vacuum parameters and those in matter also means that lbl experiments with variable @xmath21 can be extremely useful in the study of @xmath7 .",
    "as was shown before @xcite , one can construct rephasing invariant combinations out of elements of a unitary , unimodular ( det@xmath27 , so that @xmath28 = matrix of cofactors of @xmath29 ) , mixing matrix , @xmath30 where their common imaginary part can be identified with the jarlskog invariant @xmath31 @xcite .",

    ", it is traditional to label the matrix elements as @xmath8 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",

    "the constraints eqs .",
    "( [ con1 ] ) and ( 4 ) can be easily derived by using the identity @xmath53 .",
    "one can obtain other useful relations when we consider product of the form @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the well - known rephasing invariant expression @xmath55 consists of four such terms .",
    "for instance , @xmath56 the combination @xmath57 has the additional property that it is rephasing invariant even if det@xmath58 . another useful formula ( with det@xmath59 )",

    "thus , if we take the matrix elements in the @xmath72-th row and the @xmath73-th column , complex conjugate the vertex @xmath74 , then the product is rephasing invariant and has a well - defined imaginary part .",

    "provides another way to compute @xmath31 .",

    "we will discuss these applications in sec .",
    "over the past couple of decades , a wealth of information has been gathered by neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "it would be useful to analyze the available data systematically so as to gain an overview of the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "to this end it is important to choose a set of parameters which can bring out clearly the salient features of @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we propose to use certain combinations of the variables @xmath40 which , as we shall see , can highlight the symmetry properties of @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , they have simple behaviors when used in the study of neutrino propagation in matter .    specifically , we choose the parameters , @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath80 , and @xmath81 @xmath82 these variables are considered to be functions of @xmath11 , the induced neutrino mass , which will be used when we discuss neutrino propagation in matter .",
    "for the specific case of vacuum values , @xmath83 , we will use the notation @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    the variables @xmath0 and @xmath2 are not independent .",
    "obviously , @xmath86 the set @xmath2 also satisfies a simple constraint . from @xmath87 and , using eqs .",

    "our numerical results are thus only approximate .",
    "more precise ones can only be obtained by analyzing directly the experiments in terms of the parameters @xmath19 .    for the actual numbers we will use the summaries from existing global analyses @xcite , after making the proper conversion of variables .",

    "the discrepancy between these two results , as well as the large percentage errors in each , is a reflection of the poor quality of them .    to complete the list",
    "we need one more piece of information on @xmath85 . despite the lack of another independent measurement , it turns out that the known values of @xmath125 can already set a stringent bound on @xmath126 . to see that we return to eq .",

    "experimentally , the vacuum values of @xmath0 ( @xmath125 ) are well - determined . but for @xmath2 there is only one measurement on @xmath235 , which turns out to be small ( @xmath277 ) , with large uncertainties . however , using eq .",
    "( [ eq27 ] ) , one can establish the bound @xmath278 , whose validity depends on the approximation @xmath279 .",
    "there is also a sum rule relating @xmath126 to @xmath151 , eq .",
    "( [ jo ] ) .",
    "it is thus urgent to have a precision measurement on @xmath126 , although the task can be very challenging .",
    "turning to neutrino propagation in matter , we find that the parameters have simple dependences on @xmath21 , the induced mass . to a good approximation , there are two resonance regions ( @xmath169 and @xmath172 ) where they change rapidly . outside of these there are three regions of @xmath21 in which all parameters take on values that are nearly constant .",
    "these are given in detail in sec .",
    "v. starting from @xmath150 for vacuum ( @xmath83 ) , the list of free parameters gets shorter as @xmath21 increases . for @xmath182",
    ", there are only two : @xmath280 , @xmath281 . for @xmath189 , it is down to one : @xmath282 . physically , this behavior is a consequence of decoupling , and can be tested in lbl experiments .",
    "so far , the analysis is done under the assumption of normal hierarchy . for the case of inverted hierarchy ,",
    "similar results are obtained with the omission of the higher resonance .    in conclusion ,",
    "given the incomplete knowledge that is now available , it is seen that , with the help of consistency conditions and the approximations @xmath279 and @xmath283 , much can already be learned quantitatively about @xmath227 , both in vacuum and in matter .",
    "it is hoped that our analysis will be helpful toward establishing a comprehensive specification of the neutrino mixing matrix ."
