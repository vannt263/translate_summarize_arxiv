    "a substitution tiling is a tiling of @xmath3 formed from a primitive substitution rule @xmath4 on a finite prototile set @xmath5 .",
    "most tilings of interest display finite rotational and reflectional symmetries .",
    "for instance , the famous penrose tilings of @xmath6 display symmetry under rotation by @xmath7 . a finite group @xmath8 acting on @xmath9 will be called a _ symmetry group _ for @xmath1 if it commutes with the substitution @xmath4 . here",
    "we study the actions of such groups on c*-algebras associated to @xmath1 .    associating a c*-algebra to an aperiodic substitution @xmath1 goes back to connes @xcite who constructed an af algebra from penrose tilings .",
    "he showed that penrose tilings are in one - to - one correspondence with infinite paths through a certain bratteli diagram , and that two such paths are tail equivalent if and only if their associated tilings could be taken to one another by an isometry of the plane .",
    "later , kellendonk @xcite defined a different c*-algebra @xmath2 from @xmath1 ; this is the reduced c*-algebra of the ' etale groupoid @xmath10 of translational equivalence only .",
    "this c*-algebra has been studied by many authors , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    since the c*-algebra connes associated to the penrose tiling is af , it is classified by its pointed @xmath11 group by @xcite .",
    "not only is the c*-algebra @xmath2 not in general an af algebra , it is not known whether it can be classified by its elliott invariant ( which is essentially k - theory paired with traces ) .",
    "some partial progress has been made in this direction beginning with work of putnam @xcite who proved that the order on @xmath12 was determined by the unique normalized trace on @xmath2 .",
    "to do this , putnam used the presence of a canonical af subalgebra @xmath13 which is the c*-algebra of an af subequivalence relation @xmath14 .    in @xcite phillips",
    "generalized the techniques of @xcite to the c*-algebras of what he called _ almost af cantor groupoids_. a groupoid @xmath15 is of this type if it has an af subgroupoid @xmath16 that is `` large '' in a suitable sense ; this notably includes not only @xmath10 but also groupoids associated to free minimal actions of @xmath17 on the cantor set .",
    "phillips proved that the reduced c*-algebras of these groupoids have some nice classification properties , including real rank zero , stable rank one , and order on @xmath11 being determined by traces .",
    "he also showed that normalized traces on @xmath18 are in one - to - one correspondence with normalized traces on @xmath19 .",
    "these results can be seen as significant progress towards answering the question of whether such c*-algebras can be classified by their elliott invariant .",
    "phillips notes in @xcite question 8.1 that if one could prove that all such c*-algebras have _ tracial rank zero _ then they would be classified by their elliott invariant , though whether they have tracial rank zero or not is still unresolved .    in this paper",
    "we study the action of a finite symmetry group @xmath0 on the c*-algebras @xmath2 and @xmath20 under the assumption that @xmath0 acts freely on @xmath9 .",
    "this situation is far from rare  indeed , substitutions are typically presented on a finite set of _ standard position _",

    "we prove that that the crossed product @xmath21 is isomorphic to the c*-algebra of an almost af cantor groupoid , and hence @xmath21 has real rank zero , stable rank one , and the order on @xmath22 is determined by traces ( theorem [ rpxgalmostaf ] ) . in section [ tracesection ] we show that @xmath21 has a unique trace ( corollary [ uniquetracecor ] ) , and show in remark [ connesremark ] that the af algebra that connes associated to the penrose tilings is isomorphic to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dihedral group @xmath25 generated by @xmath26 ( the counterclockwise rotation by @xmath7 ) and @xmath27 ( the reflection over the @xmath28-axis ) .    in section [ rpsection ]",
    "we study properties of the action of @xmath0 on @xmath2 .",
    "we first prove that the action of @xmath0 on @xmath2 has the _ weak rokhlin property _ of matui and sato @xcite .",
    "we also note that if we assume that @xmath2 has tracial rank zero , then the action of @xmath0 on @xmath2 satisfies the _ tracial rokhlin property _ of phillips , see @xcite . these results both imply that if one could prove that @xmath2 has tracial rank zero , then this would imply that @xmath21 would also have tracial rank zero , and so would be classified by its elliott invariant .",
