    "the random walk is a paradigmatic stochastic process which underlies a vast variety of phenomena in physics , chemistry and biology ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in particular , two models of lattice",
    "random walks are found in the literature with equal frequency .",
    "the first is the so - called polya walk ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , in which the random walker moves at _ discrete _ time moments @xmath2 on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice so that if it is at site @xmath3 it steps on neighbouring site @xmath4 with probability @xmath5 .",
    "the second model is the montroll - weiss random walk  @xcite , in which the same random walk evolves in _ continuous _ time , and the times @xmath6 between successive jumps are independent , identically distributed random variables with a common probability density function @xmath7 .",
    "it is often tacitly assumed that in the canonical case when the waiting ( or pausing ) time density is exponential , i.e. , when @xmath8 , the montroll - weiss random walk leads to behaviour _ identical _ to that of the polya walk in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "the purpose of this short note is to demonstrate that this is indeed the case for _ symmetric _ random walks , but that in the presence of an external bias the two models exhibit markedly different behaviour .",
    "although this non - equivalence of the two standard models can be explained on intuitive grounds , to the best of our knowledge it has been never spelled out explicitly .",
    "consider a polya random walk on a @xmath0-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice with axes @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and suppose that there is a constant force @xmath13 acting on the walker which points in the positive @xmath10-direction . in this case , the standard transition probabilities @xmath5 which obey detailed balance are given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the reciprocal temperature , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the probabilities to jump in the direction of the applied force , in the direction opposite to the applied force , and in any direction perpendicular to the force , respectively , and @xmath19 is the normalisation constant @xmath20 consider the site occupation probability @xmath21 , that is , the probability of finding the walker at site @xmath22 at discrete time moment @xmath23 .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath24 of the site occupation probability is defined as its discrete fourier transform , @xmath25 for a polya walk this function can easily be calculated to give @xmath26 differentiating the latter equation once and twice over @xmath27 leads to the following expressions for the first two moments of the displacement along the @xmath10-axis : @xmath28 and @xmath29 so that the variance for motion along the @xmath10-axis is given by @xmath30 similarly , differentiating once and twice with respect to any given @xmath31 we find that the variance of the site occupation distribution in any direction perpendicular to the field is given by @xmath32    to calculate analogous properties for the continuous - time montroll - weiss random walk with an exponential pausing time distribution , we take advantage of the montroll - weiss theorem  @xcite which establishes a general relation between @xmath21 for the discrete - time walk and its continuous - time counterpart @xmath33 describing the site - occupation probability for the continuous - time process .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the generating function of the site occupation probability @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath35 the montroll - weiss theorem states that the laplace transform of the site - occupation probability @xmath36 for the continuous - time walk and @xmath34 are related as follows : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the laplace transformed pausing - time density .",
    "multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) by @xmath10 and @xmath39 , and summing over all lattice sites , we readily find the following results for the moments of the displacement of the continuous - time random walk along the @xmath10-axis : @xmath40 and @xmath41 in a similar fashion we find that the variance in any direction perpendicular to the field obeys @xmath42     along the @xmath10-axis as a function of @xmath43 for two - dimensional lattices .",
    "the red line is the result for the polya walk , @xmath44 , eq .",
    "( [ var1 ] ) , while the blue line is the result for the continuous - time random walk , @xmath45 , eq .",
    "( [ var2]).,scaledwidth=55.0% ]",
    "we conclude with the comparison of the results in eqs .",
    "( [ mean1 ] ) and ( [ mean2 ] ) , eqs .",
    "( [ var1 ] ) and ( [ var2 ] ) , and eqs .",
    "( [ var11 ] ) and ( [ var22 ] ) .",
    "one immediately notices that both models predict exactly the same values for the  velocities \" @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( first moments of the site occupation distributions ) , as well as for the reduced vriances var@xmath48 and var@xmath49 obtained from these distributions in the direction perpendicular to the field . on the contrary , for these two models , often assumed to lead to identical results , the diffusion coefficients ( variances ) along the @xmath10-axis exhibit markedly different behaviours as depicted in fig.[fig0 ] . the variance along the @xmath10-direction for the polya walk is a monotonically _ decreasing _ function of the field , while for the continuous - time random walk with exponential waiting time distribution it is ( for @xmath50 ) a monotonically _ increasing _ function of the field which saturates at a finite value as @xmath51 . in one - dimension the variance is _ independent _ of the value of the applied field .",
    "this difference in behaviours stems from the fact that for the discrete - time random walk the number of steps does not fluctuate so that the system tends toward a deterministic ballistic motion as @xmath51 , that is , all realisations in this limit cover the same ground and the variance vanishes . on the other hand , for the continuous - time random walk the number of steps fluctuates from realisation to realisation , which contributes to the variance no matter how strong the field ( however , only along the @xmath10-direction ) .",
    "note that such a striking difference between these two models is completely lost , of course , when one turns to the continuous - space and time description in the diffusion limit .",
    "note as well that for @xmath52 , both results show the same dependence on the field , which ensures the validity of the einstein relation between diffusion coefficient and mobility for both models ."
