    "static properties of granular packings have been a very active field of research in recent years .",
    "granular packings are assemblies of macroscopic particles that interact only via mechanical repulsion mediated through physical contacts @xcite .",
    "in contrast with continuum solids , forces on individual grains in a granular packing can be directly accessed both experimentally @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "these forces are found to be organized in highly heterogeneous networks that depend strongly on construction history of the packing @xcite .",
    "statistical studies , motivated to deal with such history dependence and heterogeneity of the forces on individual grains , have identified two main global characteristics of static granular packings .",
    "first , the distribution for the magnitudes of inter - grain forces is very broad , with an exponential decay for large force magnitudes and a plateau at small force magnitudes @xcite .",
    "secondly , the average response of the packings to a single vertically downwards external force depends strongly on the underlying geometry : in ordered packings , the applied force is mainly transmitted along the principal lattice directions emanating from the point of application of the force , while in disordered packings there is a single vertical propagation direction @xcite .",
    "although a large number of different theoretical models have been proposed to study these two global characteristics of granular packings , each of these models successfully accounts for at most one of them .",
    "for example , the so - called @xmath0-model @xcite is a scalar lattice model that describes the fluctuations in force transmission within a granular packing at the first approximation . while this model does produce realistic distributions for the magnitudes of inter - grain forces ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) , it predicts a diffusive response to a single external force in conflict with experiments @xcite . on the other hand , vectorial extensions of the @xmath0-model @xcite ,",
    "compatible with a more general `` stress - only '' approach @xcite , were shown to lead to stochastic wave equations . for weak disorder ,",
    "these equations predict a ray - like propagation of stresses in agreement with experiments , but for strong disorder , the corresponding behaviour of the stresses is less clear - cut .",
    "this has further led to the introduction of an ad - hoc `` force chain splitting '' model @xcite .",
    "the vectorial extensions of the @xmath0-model and the force - chain splitting models do predict realistic response behaviour for granular packings , but the relation between microscopic stochasticity and resulting distributions for the magnitudes of inter - grain forces within these models is not entirely clear .",
    "finally , in contrast with these stochastic approaches , classical elastic theory has been used for years in the engineering community @xcite .",
    "the predictions of this theory for the response behaviour of granular packings match the experimental results rather successfully @xcite .",
    "however , elasticity theory provides only a macroscopic , average level description , and thus it provides no information on the force distribution .",
    "moreover , its derivation from the grain - level mechanics still seems to be a significant challenge @xcite .",
    "from this perspective , a unifying approach leading to both realistic fluctuations in the individual inter - grain force magnitudes and transmissions of forces in a granular packing clearly seems to be necessary .",
    "interestingly , in a different context ( namely , that of granular compaction ) a basis for such an approach has been laid down by edwards years ago @xcite . by analogy with conventional statistical mechanics ,",
    "the fundamental hypothesis is to consider all `` jammed '' configurations equally likely .",
    "although no microscopic justification for such an ergodic assumption is available so far , experiments and numerical studies of quasi - static granular media support such a thermodynamic picture @xcite .",
    "it thus seems very tempting to extend this hypothesis to the study of forces in static granular packings by considering sets of forces belonging to all mechanically stable configurations equally likely .",
    "if this idea of equal probability ensemble is to be applied to study the forces in a granular packing , it has to be realized that two levels of randomness are generally present in the ensemble of forces for stable granular packings @xcite .",
    "this stems from the fact that forces in a granular packing depend critically on the underlying contact network between the grains .",
    "contact networks that are deemed isostatic uniquely determine the forces admissible on them , and thus , the application of the equal - probability hypothesis to packings with isostatic contact networks amounts to considering each contact network equally likely .",
    "such a consideration leads to wave equations in disordered geometry whach are in conflict with experiments @xcite . however , realistic contact networks are generically non - isostatic , and the fact that several force configurations can be compatible with a given non - isostatic contact network gives rise to the second level of randomness @xcite .    instead of applying edward s hypothesis to both levels of randomness simultaneously ,",
    "a natural first step is to apply the uniform probability hypothesis first to a fixed contact network , and then possibly average over various contact networks .",
    "such a study in a fixed contact network has recently been shown to produce distributions for the magnitudes of inter - grain forces that compare very well with experiments @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we briefly showed that the application of the uniform probability hypothesis in an ordered geometry also leads to a response to an external force qualitatively in agreement with experiments . in this paper",
    ", we report the same study in full detail .",
    "more precisely , we determine the behaviour of the response of a two - dimensional hexagonal packing of rigid , frictionless and massless spherical grains placed between two vertical walls ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) , due to a vertically downward force @xmath3 applied on a single grain at the top layer .",
    "we define the response of the packing as @xmath4/w_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ ] , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the vertical forces transmitted by the @xmath7-th grain to the layer below it respectively with and without applied external force @xmath3 . for massless grains @xmath8 .",
    "the angular brackets here denote averaging with equal probability over all configurations of mechanically stable non - negative contact forces .",
    "we find that the problem of equally - probable force configurations in the hexagonal geometry is equivalent to a correlated @xmath0-model .",
    "using this formulation , simulations for a variety of boundary conditions show that the response to an external force applied on the top of the packing displays two symmetric peaks lying precisely on the two downward lattice directions emanating from the point of application of the force .",
    "moreover , the response exhibits remarkable scaling with the system size , implying that in the thermodynamic limit the peaks propagate all the way to the bottom of the packing .",
    "surprisingly , average values @xmath9 as well as higher correlations can be calculated _ exactly _ for any system size via this formulation .",
    "we show that all these quantities can be expressed in terms of integers corresponding to an underlying discrete structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we examine the equal - probability hypothesis in a fixed geometry , and its application to the hexagonal geometry in detail . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we numerically study the response as well as the distributions of the single @xmath0 s and correlations between them . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we detail the full theoretical calculation of @xmath9 and higher correlations for any system size .",
    "we finally end this paper with a discussion in sec .",

    "array of hexagonally close - packed rigid frictionless spherical grains in two - dimensions . at the top",
    ", there is only a single vertically downward point force applied on one grain .",
    "( b ) for massless grains , the vertical forces are non - zero only inside a triangle formed by the two lattice directions emanating from the point of application of @xmath3 , so that we can restrict our study to that domain .",
    "the horizontal forces on boundaries of the triangular domain are the same as those on the boundaries in ( a ) . ]",
    "to start with , let us examine more closely the inter - grain forces in a granular packing @xcite . as pointed out earlier ,",
    "the grains mutually interact only via ( mechanical ) repulsive contact forces .",
    "the contacts are assumed pointlike , and in the present study , we consider only frictionless grains , so that each contact force is locally normal to the grain surface .",
    "thus , the most fundamental entity entering the description of forces in a granular packing is the _ contact network _ , i.e. , the set of all contact points with directions normal to the grain surfaces at respective contacts @xcite .",
    "consider such a contact network formed by a packing of @xmath10 grains with @xmath11 contacts .",
    "for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to two dimensions in the following analysis . at each contact @xmath12 for @xmath13 ,",
    "the force is represented by its magnitude @xmath14 along the locally normal direction to the grain surface , with the convention that a positive magnitude of @xmath14 corresponds to a repulsive force .",
    "the forces applied on a given grain must satisfy three newton s equations : two for balancing forces in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions and one for balancing torque . for the system in its entirety",
    ", the contact forces can be grouped in a column vector @xmath17 consisting of @xmath11 non - negative scalars @xmath18 , satisfying @xmath19 stability equations represented by @xmath20 .",
    "here , @xmath21 is an @xmath22-dimensional column vector representing the external forces and torques on the grains , and @xmath23 is an @xmath24 matrix uniquely specified by the contact network .",
    "if the grains in question are disks , as is the case in most of theoretical and numerical studies , the torque balance is automatically satisfied , and the total number of equations @xmath22 drops to @xmath25 . note also that there is some freedom in the definition of @xmath17 : a contact force between a grain and a boundary can either be considered as an internal force , i.e. , as a part of @xmath17 ; or as an external force , in which case it becomes a part of @xmath21 .    in the above description , if @xmath26 is invertible  which of course implies @xmath27  the force configuration allowed on the contact network is unique : such a contact network is called isostatic .",
    "otherwise either there is an extended set @xmath28 of allowed force configurations , in which case the network is called hyperstatic , or there is none , the packing under consideration is unstable under the imposed external forces .",
    "theoretical arguments suggest that perfectly rigid grains generically form isostatic packings @xcite .",
    "physical grains are of course never infinitely rigid , and the corresponding contact networks are hyperstatic .",
    "these observations are confirmed by numerical studies , which moreover find that the convergence to isostaticity with increasing rigidity of the grains is rather slow @xcite . to determine the forces uniquely",
    ", one then in principle has to take into account the `` force law '' , which relates the deformation of a particle to the force applied on it , as well as the construction history of the packing .",
    "nevertheless , some macroscopic properties of a granular packing , such as the ditribution of force magnitudes and the shape of the average response to a point force , are independent of the details of the force law @xcite . from that point of view , if one considers a packing of grains of large but finite rigidity , the deformations of the grains are small with respect to their characteristic sizes , and these deformations could be altered without essentially modifying the ( hyperstatic ) contact network @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this can be achieved by gently tapping the packing without adding or removing contacts @xcite . without having to delve deeper in the microscopic force laws",
    ", one can then analyze the contact force configurations as a subset of the set @xmath28 of allowed force configurations .",
    "by analogy to classical statistical mechanics , one can study the statistical properties of the set @xmath28 .",
    "a natural starting point is to assume that any point in @xmath28 is visited with the same frequency , similar to a microcanonical ensemble . in other words ,",
    "one assigns a uniform probability measure on @xmath28 , under which all allowed contact force configurations are equally likely .",
    "we should however keep in mind that _ a priori _ there is no clear justification for such an ergodic hypothesis .    the uniform measure on @xmath28",
    "can be defined more precisely .",
    "the set of all solutions of @xmath29 is an affine space , whose dimension is the dimension of the kernel of @xmath26 , and @xmath28 is a subset of that space where @xmath30 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath28 is usually a compact polygon @xcite , so that the uniform measure is well defined . for a hyperstatic packing",
    ", @xmath31 is non - zero , and a parametrization of @xmath28 can be constructed via the three following steps : ( 1 ) one first identifies an orthonormal basis @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) that spans the space of @xmath34 ; ( 2 ) one then determines a unique solution @xmath35 of @xmath36 by requiring @xmath37 for @xmath38 ; and ( 3 ) one finally obtains all solutions of @xmath29 as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are real numbers .",
    "the restriction of the @xmath40 s to a set @xmath41 generating non - negative forces is a possible parametrization of @xmath42 .",
    "the uniform measure on @xmath28 is thus equivalent to the uniform measure @xmath43 on @xmath41 .",

    "since our main interest are the @xmath59 s , this implies that we can restrict ourselves to the triangular domain , for which the forces exerted on the boundaries are the same as the forces on the boundary of the original system [ see fig . [ fig1](b ) ] .      as stated in sec .",

    "while in both cases the contact network is clearly hyperstatic , the configurations of the internal forces are slightly different .",
    "we start with the case of `` hard walls '' .    for reasons which will become clear later on , we will consider the contact forces on the right and the bottom boundaries as internal forces , i.e. , as a part of @xmath60 , while the forces on the top and right boundaries will be considered as a part of @xmath21 .",

    "similar expressions can also be obtained for all higher moments and correlations .",
    "interestingly , the original symmetry of the model is not apparent at all in this formulation .",
    "although the final results , once calculated [ cf . fig.[compare ] ] , display of course the symmetry , it seems difficult to show that the underlying discrete problem is indeed symmetric .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the response of a hexagonal packing of rigid , frictionless , massless , spherical grains to a single external force at the top of it , by supposing all mechanically stable force configurations equally likely .",
    "we have shown that this problem is equivalent to a correlated @xmath0-model .",
    "interestingly , while the conventional @xmath0-model produces a single - peaked , diffusive response , our model leads to two sharp peaks on the boundary , i.e. , on the two lattice directions emanating from the point of application of the external force . for systems of finite size , the magnitude of these peaks decreases towards the bottom of the packing , while progressively a broader",
    ", central maximum appears between the peaks .",
    "the response function displays a remarkable scaling behaviour with system size @xmath1 : while the response in the bulk of the packing scales as @xmath2 , on the boundary it is independent of @xmath1 , so that in the thermodynamic limit only the peaks on the lattice directions persist",
    ". we have obtained exact expressions of the @xmath552 values , i.e. , of the response , and of higher correlations for any system size in terms of integers corresponding to an underlying discrete structure , but we have not been able to derive an expression for the scaling limit .",
    "the resemblance of the discrete structure with plane - partition problems @xcite might lead to further progress in that direction .",
    "qualitatively , the response obtained via the uniform probability hypothesis is thus in agreement with experiments .",
    "it should however be noted that in experiments , the width of the peaks increases linearly with depth , while in our model , the peaks are single - grain diameter wide at any depth . such peak widening , in our opinion , is a consequence of inter - grain friction .",
    "indeed , a recent study @xcite has shown that friction in rectangular packings produces a widening of the peaks around the two lattice directions emanating from the point of application of the single external force , with the peak width proportional to the square root of depth . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the various force configurations have not been sampled uniformly as in our model , but rather the sampling was carried out in a fashion similar to the usual @xmath0-model , with independent random values at each grain .",
    "we are now attempting to study the effect of friction within the uniform ensemble in both rectangular and hexagonal geometries ; but our preliminary attempts reveal that such a study is technically difficult as the mapping to an analogous @xmath0-formulation breaks down .    a natural question that arises in view of our work is whether the uniform probability hypothesis leads to one of three categories that the existing continuum - type models for the transmissions of stresses have been classified into ( namely , elliptic , hyperbolic and parabolic according to the nature of the underlying coarse - grained pde s ) @xcite . given the critical importance of the underlying network of contacts , it seems difficult to give a general answer to this question . for the hexagonal geometry that we studied ,",
    "it is possible to write a coarse - grained equation for vertical stresses @xmath553 using the @xmath0-formulation ; indeed , since the correlation length between the @xmath0 s is rather short , the continuous limit is the same is in the usual @xmath0-model @xcite @xmath554 where @xmath555 is the noise resulting from the continuous limit of @xmath556 .",
    "however , in contrast with the usual @xmath0-model , the mean @xmath557 is position - dependent as found in sec .",

    "such a formulation thus does not seem very useful , as the properties of the noise and the self - similarity have to be somehow first obtained from the equal - probability ensemble hypothesis .",
    "nevertheless , the study of a tensorial formulation of this model is an interesting future direction .",
    "finally , apart from the inclusion of friction in the present model , the next important future direction is the study of the response of disordered granular packings . in that case",
    ", averages would have to be taken first for a fixed contact network , and then over different contact networks corresponding to different arrangement geometries of grains .",
