    "three - dimensional fluid dynamic simulations of turbulent convection in an oxygen - burning shell of a presupernova star show bursty fluctuations which are not seen in one - dimensional stellar evolutionary calculations ( which use various versions of mixing - length theory , mlt , @xcite ) .",
    "our particular example is a set of simulations of oxygen burning in a shell of a star of @xmath0 ( @xcite .",
    "this is of astronomical interest in its own right as a model for a supernova progenitor , but also happens to represent a relatively simple and computationally efficient case , and has general implications for the convection process in all stars .",
    "three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of shell oxygen burning exhibit bursty , recurrent fluctuations in turbulent kinetic energy ( see fig .  1 , left panel ) .",
    "these simulations show a damping , and eventual cessation , of turbulent motion if we artificially turn off the nuclear burning ( @xcite ) .",
    "further investigation by @xcite shows that nearly identical pulsations are obtained with a volumetric energy generation rate which is constant in time , so that _ the cause of the pulsation is independent of any temperature or composition dependence in the oxygen burning rate .",
    "_ heating is necessary to drive the convection ; even with this time - independent rate of heating , we still get pulses in the turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "such behavior is fundamentally different from traditional nuclear - energized pulsations dealt with in the literature ( e.g. , the @xmath1-mechanism , @xcite ) , and is a consequence of time - dependent turbulent convection ( it might be called a `` @xmath2-mechanism '' , with @xmath2 standing for turbulence ) .",
    "this section was written with the aid of extensive email discussions with a. nordlund and r. stein .",
    "@xcite , analyzing the 3d simulations of @xcite , found that buoyancy driving is balanced by viscous ( kolmogorov ) dissipation ; the remaining terms ( mostly the kinetic energy flux escaping the convection zone ) were less than 6% of the total .",
    "@xcite found that the buoyancy terms exactly cancelled , and that the viscous dissipation was balanced by average gas pressure work .",
    "which is correct ?",
    "upon careful reanalysis , both are , as we shall show .",
    "there are two limiting cases for convective flow , depending upon the convective mach number @xmath3 ( the ratio of the fluid speed to the local sound speed ) .",
    "the case @xmath4 corresponds to  incompressible \" flow . for turbulent motion ,",
    "the pressure perturbation @xmath5 is related to the convective mach number by @xmath6 , and must be small .",
    "sound waves outstrip fluid motion , so that pressure differences quickly become small , except possibly for a static background stratification .",
    "most of the historical research on convection ( e.g. , the bnard problem , @xcite ) is done in this limit ( the bousinesq approximation , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the average of any variable @xmath8 over a spherical shell ( lagrangian stellar coordinate ) .",
    "the density perturbation @xmath9 and the velocity perturbation @xmath10 are both first order in @xmath3 , while the pressure terms ( both gas and turbulent pressure ) and the average velocity @xmath11 are of second order . at low @xmath3 the first order terms dominate , but as @xmath3 rises , the second and higher order terms become important , changing the physical behavior of the system .",
    "@xmath3 does not increase indefinitely for a quasi - static system ; as it approaches unity , kinetic energy approaches internal energy in magnitude , and the system becomes gravitationally unbound , allowing no quasi - static solution .",
    "there is a narrow range , @xmath12 , in which this interesting transition occurs . except in dynamic situations , convection in stellar interiors",
    "satisfies @xmath13 , for which the boussinesq limit is a reasonable approximation .",
    "near stellar surfaces of cool stars , @xmath14 , and the boussinesq limit is no longer accurate .",
    "we are interested in the rate of transfer of energy into different forms , so we consider various terms for power per unit volume , or energy per unit volume per unit time . in order to fix the terminology ,",
    "let us define some terms :    * _ buoyancy power _ is @xmath15 , * _ gas pressure power _ is @xmath16 , * _ net rate of work done by gravity _ is @xmath17 , * _ net rate of work done by gravity on the mean flow _ is @xmath18 , and * _ net rate of gas pressure work on the mean flow",
    "_ is @xmath19 .    for a quasi - steady state , @xmath20 so that @xmath21 , which requires @xmath22 .",
    "this is true for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that the total work done by gravity vanishes , but can be split into a ( positive ) work done on the convective motions , called buoyancy power , and a ( negative ) work done on the mean flow , that is , @xmath23 . ignoring boundary and wave effects for the moment , the gas pressure power is balanced by viscous ( kolmogorov ) dissipation , @xmath24 , see @xcite .",
    "historically @xmath25 has been used in the boussinesq approximation as the driving term for convection ( @xcite ) . using the cowling approximation we may move the gravity outside the average , so that @xmath26 . in the boussinesq limit , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium holds , @xmath27 , and the rate of work done on the fluid passing through the pressure gradient is @xmath28 the mathematical result is the same as if the buoyancy power @xmath29 alone were used , and provides consistency with the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the general result that , integrated over a convection zone , the buoyancy work is balanced by the viscous dissipation , is still valid in the incompressible limit ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same result is found for turbulent flow by @xcite : buoyancy power is balanced by kolmogorov dissipation .    for the simulations of @xcite , @xmath30 so that the pressure fluctuations are small ( @xmath31 ) , clearly in the incompressible regime .",
    "in this limit @xcite show that @xmath32 , so that the the convective velocity field is directly related to the enthalpy flux .",
    "this connection is ignored in mlt , but is important for stellar evolution because _ it removes the freedom to adjust _ the mlt parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the flow is accelerated by a torque in the horizontal plane , and tends to be divergence free ( solenoidal , or  rotational \" ) because of mass conservation .",
    "the velocities are small enough so that , to the same level of approximation , ram pressure may be ignored , and the background stratification is hydrostatic .",
    "the `` compressible '' limit is @xmath34 , for which @xmath35 .",
    "shock formation is the most startling change in the flow character .",
    "sound wave generation increases rapidly as @xmath36 ( @xcite ,  75 ) .",
    "the flow becomes diverging , or `` irrotational '' ( consider the extreme limit of a point explosion which is pure divergence ) . even in the case of convective flow ,",
    "ram pressure levitation begins to become important ( @xcite ) .",
    "generally the flow begins to cause structural change and becomes even more complex . in this case",
    "the simple picture of pure buoyancy driving begins to break down ; increasingly more work is done to generate diverging flows as @xmath3 increases .    if the convective region does not have an overall divergence ( i.e.",
    ", is in a quasi - steady state ) , the excess pressure fluctuations ( beyond those implied by the buoyancy flux ) must generate waves ( both sound waves and gravity waves ) , which may propagate beyond the convective region .",
    "the ram pressure from the flow will cause the quasi - steady convection zone to expand as @xmath3 increases .",
    "because of turbulence , episodes of vigorous local pulsation may occur .",
    "further increase in @xmath3 may lead to vigorous global pulsation and even explosion ( @xmath37 implies the kinetic energy is of order the internal energy ) . notice the transition from rotational flow toward diverging flow as @xmath3 increases .      which of the @xmath3 limits is relevant for astrophysics ?",
    "_ almost all _ the matter in stellar convection zones , during _ almost all _ evolution , is in the limit of incompressible flow . for the sun",
    ", the region for which @xmath14 ( so that the pressure fluctuations are greater than @xmath38 ) , contains only about @xmath39 of a solar mass .",
    "however all stars with cool surfaces have a superadiabatic region in which the convective mach numbers rise to @xmath40 or more , and _",
    "these regions are the ones observed .",
    "_ quasi - static oxygen burning , one of the most vigorous nuclear processes to drive convection , has @xmath4 , and this is true for other thermonuclear processes as well ; but they evolve to violent and explosive events for which @xmath37 .",
    "the exceptions to @xmath41 are important : ( 1 ) explosions , such as supernovae and novae , ( 2 ) vigorous thermonuclear flashes , ( 3 ) vigorous pulsations , especially radial ones , and ( 4 ) the sub - photospheric layers of stellar surface convection zones , which are strongly non - adiabatic , to name a few . consequently the transition ( near @xmath42 , implying pressure perturbations of order @xmath43 ) between these two limiting cases is emerging as an important problem in astrophysics .",
    "we have made some theoretical progress in understanding the @xmath4 case , and will now follow eddington s advice to ",
    "push a theory until it breaks , \" to see what happens .",
    "@xcite devised a simple model ( three degrees of freedom ) of a convective cell which captured the seeds of chaos in terms of the lorenz strange attractor , which is part of the foundation of the study of instabilities in nonlinear systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "the model is an extreme truncation of the fluid dynamics equations , reducing a system of seven variables and about @xmath44 grid points ( fig .  1 ( left ) ) to one of amplitudes of three variables ( fig .  1 ( right ) )",
    "this reduces the degrees of freedom from @xmath45 to merely 3 . to attain this simplification , only a single mode , of low mach number flow ,",
    "was examined in two dimensions (  a convective roll \" ) .",
    "the three variables are the speed of the convective roll , the vertical temperature fluctuation , and the horizontal temperature fluctuation . for sufficiently large reynolds number ( essentially luminosity in excess of that which can be carried by radiative diffusion ) ,",
    "the flow becomes chaotic . in mlt ,",
    "the vertical and horizontal temperature fluctuations are assumed identical , and this two variable model is not chaotic ( @xcite ) .",
    "we examine the conjecture that the fluctuating behavior of the lorenz model is a simple version of that seem in our 3d compressible , multi - mode convection simulations . @xcite",
    "make the simple generalization of the lorenz model to include nuclear heating . in fig .",
    "1 is a comparison of the fluctuating behavior of kinetic energy for the 3d simulation ( left panel ) and the generalized lorenz model ( right panel ) .",
    "the behavior is similar , with the largest differences due to the fact that the 3d simulation exhibits many modes , while the lorenz model has only one by definition .",
    "this suggests that the fluctuations seen in the 3d simulation are related to the onset of chaotic behavior in the much simpler lorenz model .",
    "analytically , the equations of 3d fluid flow used in the simulations may be directly simplified to obtain the lorenz equations ( see @xcite ) , which strengthens the suggestion .",
    "@xcite suggested , based upon mlt , that convection was dominated by cells , whose size was determined by the size of a local pressure scale height .",
    "simulations suggest that this is qualitatively true ; mass conservation in a stratified medium implies cells of a density scale height in size ( see @xcite ) .",
    "suppose that we imagine the convective zone to be made of cells , each of which we approximate by a lorenz model ?",
    "2 illustrates a cross - section segment of part of such a planar convective layer .",
    "we do not imagine that the cells are fixed as in a crystalline structure , but that the cells are unstable , forming and decaying in a dynamic way , with average properties approximated by independent lorenz models .",
    "each lorenz cell has a fluctuation in energy flux it carries , and this is identified with a fluctuation in luminosity of that horizontal patch of the convective layer . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the fluctuations of cells in underlying layers , and in the same spirit , the fact that stellar photospheres often exhibit convective mach numbers which are not small .",
    "@xcite noted that for the sun , the local pressure scale height was relatively small , implying that the size of a convective cell was also small relative to the radius , similar to the size of a granule .",
    "such a large number of cells ( @xmath46 ) would average out fluctuations over a stellar disk . for red supergiants ,",
    "the scale heights approach the radius in size , so that a few cells would be sufficient to cover the surface , and the fluctuations in luminosity would be more obvious .",
    "combining schwarzschild s idea of convective cells with lorenz s model of a cell allows us to construct a simple model of a stellar convective surface , which contains an element of the fluctuating nature of turbulence , although it may to be a crude approximation in that it has no realistic photospheric layer .",
    "3 shows the luminosity fluctuations implied by such a model ( left panel ) .",
    "the amplitude of the luminosity fluctuations are simply those of the classical lorenz model .",
    "they are larger than but comparable to those found in 3d simulations of betelgeuse ( @xmath33 orionis ) by @xcite , and observed in red supergiants ( @xcite ) .",
    "this qualitative agreement for such a simple model is suggestive .    the right panel in fig .",
    "3 shows the spectral power density of the luminosity fluctuations shown in the left panel .",
    "there are a few broad , marginal peaks , and a lot of broad - band noise .",
    "the frequency is normalized to the time interval shown in the left panel . in a real star ,",
    "this broad - band noise would resonate with normal modes of pulsation , driving them to finite amplitude and thereby giving additional sharp peaks to the spectrum .",
    "joel stebbins ( pioneer of photoelectric astronomy ) monitored the brightness of betelgeuse ( @xmath33 orionis ) from 1917 to 1931 , and concluded that  there is no law or order in the rapid changes of betelgeuse \" ( @xcite ) , which seems apt for fig .  3 as well .",
    "more modern observations ( see @xcite ) show a strong broad - band noise component in the photometric variability .",
    "the irregular fluctuations of the light curve are aperiodic , and resemble a series of outbursts",
    ". this should be no surprise ; the 3d equations have embedded in them the strange attractor of lorenz",
    ". it will be interesting to apply these ideas to the analysis of solar - like oscillations in other stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "by quantitatively examining the implications of 3d simulations of turbulent convection , we are led to an identification of similarities in convective cells and the lorenz strange attractor . applying this connection in a simple model",
    "implies a broad - band component of the power spectrum of luminosity in stars with convective surfaces , much like that observed by @xcite .    however , there is no free lunch .",
    "application of these ideas to stellar surfaces implies their use in regimes in which the convective mach number @xmath3 is not much less than unity .",
    "will the compressible effects make qualitative changes in this picture ?",
    "we shall see .",
    "fortunately the surface of the sun is a nearby example on which we can test our theoretical ideas , and these ideas will have wide ramifications in astrophysics .",
    "this work was supported in part by by nsf grant 0708871 and nasa grant nnx08ah19 g at the university of arizona .",
    "we are grateful for helpful discussions with aake nordlund and bob stein , and thank the symposium organizers for allowing us to participate .",
    "happy birthday juri !"
