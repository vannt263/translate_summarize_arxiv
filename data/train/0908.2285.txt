    "cosmological probes of primordial non - gaussianity have recently attracted much attention because of their potential ability to discriminate between different inflationary models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "constraints on primordial non - gaussianity mainly come from the cmb @xcite and large scale structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with one particular measure of large scale structures : the probability that a cell of volume @xmath1 , placed at random in the nonlinear redshift space density field , contains a certain amount of mass ( or , equivalently , is denser than the background by a certain amount ) .",
    "this statistic is known as the nonlinear redshift space probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "our goal is to estimate this distribution for scales as small as a few mpc in the local non - gaussian model , in which the primordial perturbation potential is @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the bardeen potential , @xmath4 is a gaussian potential field and @xmath0 is the nonlinear quadratic parameter . the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fnl ] ) shows the first two terms of an ( infinite ) taylor series in @xmath4 .",
    "however , since @xmath5 , one usually ignores higher order corrections , and commonly refers to this simplified model as the @xmath0 model .",
    "this definition of @xmath3 is consistent with most of the recent studies on the local @xmath0 model .",
    "our approach is based on previous work which develops the formalism needed for estimating the evolution of the density pdf from gaussian initial conditions in real and redshift space @xcite .",
    "the evolved pdf depends on the collapse dynamics and the statistical properties of the initial density field .",
    "recently , @xcite used the fact that only the initial conditions are affected by primordial non - gaussianity to model the evolution of the real space nonlinear pdf for the local non - gaussian model .",
    "their approach provided good quantitative agreement with measurements in numerical simlations . in what follows , we will assess whether this is also true in redshift space .",
    "although it is possible to study the evolution of the redshift space pdf using perturbation theory methods @xcite , this has , somewhat surprisingly not been extended to the local non - gaussian model .",
    "thus , it is not obvious how kaiser s formula relating the variance ( the second moment of the pdf ) in real and redshift space @xcite is modified when the initial conditions are non - gaussian .",
    "( although kaiser s original derivation makes no explicit assumption about gaussianity , the gaussian assumption plays an important role in other derivations of his formula , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our approach is quite different from kaiser s , as it is based on an approximate model for the dynamics  the ellipsoidal collapse model  which reduces to perturbation theory at early times @xcite , but allows one to study more nonlinear structures @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the ability to probe deeper into the nonlinear regime , using a dynamical model that does _ not _ assume spherical symmetry , was crucial for modelling the pdf , especially in redshift space .",
    "however , implementing this approach requires knowledge of the initial shear field . for gaussian initial conditions ,",
    "this has been known for some time @xcite , but how doroshkevich s formulae are modified for the local @xmath0 model has been shown only recently @xcite .",
    "hence , we now have the necessary ingredients to study the redshift space pdf .",
    "properties of the initial shear field in the local non - gaussian model are briefly reviewed in section  [ section : plambdas ] .",
    "the dynamics of ellipsoidal collapse and the calculation of the nonlinear redshift space pdf are described in sections  [ section : ellrho ] and  [ section : zspacepdf ] .",
    "we compare our model predictions with numerical simulations in section  [ section : sims ] .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ section : discussion ] . a perturbative treatment of our model is given in appendix  [ section : pt ] ; this shows explicitly that kaiser s formula holds to lowest order in @xmath0 , but that at higher order , it is modified .",
    "let us define the nonlinear overdensity of a region of volume @xmath1 containing mass @xmath6 by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mean density .",
    "we will use @xmath9 to denote the corresponding quantity in redshift ( rather than real ) space .",
    "this section studies the expected dependence of the pdf of @xmath9 on the value of @xmath0 , when the primordial potential is given by equation  ( [ eqn : fnl ] ) .",
    "to proceed , we use the assumptions made when dealing with gaussian initial distributions ( @xmath10 ) : there is a local mapping from the eigenvalues @xmath11 of the initial deformation tensor to the nonlinear overdensity @xmath9 ( see section  [ section : ellrho ] ) ; and statistics on the smoothing scale @xmath1 at the present time are related to statistics on a different smoothing scale in the initial conditions  the relevant initial smoothing scale is the one which contains the same mass ( so it is larger for overdense cells , and smaller for underdense cells ) .    therefore , the nonlinear redshift space pdf of @xmath9 is given by @xmath12 ,   \\label{eqn : ecpdf}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the average mass in cells of size @xmath1 ) , @xmath15 denotes the 3 eigenvalues ( our convention is to have @xmath16 ) of the initial @xmath17 deformation tensor when smoothed on scale @xmath6 ( not @xmath1 ) , @xmath18 denotes the variance of the initial density fluctuation field on this smoothing scale ( the initial density fluctuation @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 is the local mapping from the initial field to the evolved density given by the ellipsodial collapse model ( spherical evolution models assume that the mapping is driven by the initial density @xmath19 only ) , and @xmath22 represents the rotation vector from the line - of - sight direction to the principle axis of the ellipsoid .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : ecpdf ] ) has the same form as equation  ( 8) of @xcite but , in our case , @xmath23 is the joint distribution of the initial eigenvalues @xmath11 in the @xmath0 model rather than in the gaussian model .    before we compute @xmath23 ,",
    "note that equation  ( [ eqn : ecpdf ] ) does not guarantee a properly normalized pdf . to ensure the correct normalization , we set @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is chosen so that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 equal unity @xcite .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the distribution of the @xmath11 at fixed @xmath19 , and let @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the corresponding quantities when @xmath10 , i.e. , for gaussian initial conditions .",
    "( note that this means @xmath32 is a gaussian . )",
    "one of the main results of @xcite was to show that @xmath33 where the final expression for @xmath34 is from @xcite , and @xmath35 is the sum of the three permutations of @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the joint distribution of @xmath11 in the @xmath0 model is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the distribution of the linear overdensity in the @xmath0 model , and @xmath31 is really a function of @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for the @xmath0 values of current interest , @xmath39 is only weakly non - gaussian , so it can be approximated by the edgeworth expansion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* who also discuss the limitations of this approximation ) .",
    "hence , the joint distribution of @xmath11 is @xmath42\\ ,     p_0({{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\lambda$}}}}|\\sigma ) , \\label{eqn : plambda}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the hermite polynomial .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 is encoded in the skewness parameter @xmath44 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and note that our convention means that @xmath45 is of same sign to @xmath0 ) . as a result ,",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : ecpdf ] ) becomes @xmath46 \\nonumber \\\\    &   \\quad \\times    p_0({{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\lambda$}}}}|\\sigma ) \\",
    ",       \\delta_{\\rm d } \\left[\\rho_s = \\rho_s'({{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\lambda$}}}},{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$}}}})\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eqn : ecpdfw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] except for the term in square brackets ( the edgeworth correction factor ) , the quantity in the integral is the same as in the gaussian case .",
    "if we think of this extra factor as a weight , then the resulting nonlinear redshift pdf in the @xmath0 model is just a suitably weighted version of that in the gaussian case .",
    "the weight depends on @xmath44 , i.e. on @xmath0 .",
    "we can gain some intuitive understanding of the effect of a nonzero @xmath0 as follows . for @xmath47 , @xmath48 so that overdense regions are suppressed compared to the gaussian case ( the weight factor is less than unity ) , whereas underdense regions are enhanced compared to the gaussian case ( the weight factor is larger than unity ) . finally , note that @xmath49 ; on mpc scales @xmath50 for @xmath51 , and it is a weakly decreasing function of scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". this will be important in what follows .",
    "the next step is to estimate how @xmath9 depends on @xmath52 . in real space ,",
    "the ellipsoidal evolution model sets @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath54 are the initial lengths of the patch which is now an sphere of radius @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the critical value of spherical collapse model ( its exact value depends weakly on cosmology : @xmath57 for the @xmath58cdm cosmology for which we show simulation data in the next section ) . in redshift space , the model sets @xmath59/3\\right\\}}{r_k^i(1-\\lambda_k)-a^i_h\\left[1-\\delta_l/3-(1-\\delta_l/\\delta_c)^{\\delta_c/3}\\right]}e_k^2 \\right]^{-1 } , \\label{eqn : ellred}\\ ] ] @xcite , where @xmath60 with @xmath61 the linear growth factor , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , where the @xmath54 are the initial axis lengths .",
    "equations  ( [ eqn : ecpdf ] ) and ( [ eqn : ellred ] ) are the bases for the computation of the nonlinear redshift space pdf .",
    "the analysis simplifies considerably if we approximate @xmath44 as a constant for a given eulerian smoothing scale ( recall that the scale dependence is rather weak ) : @xmath64 . with this assumption",
    "we can write equation  ( [ eqn : ecpdf ] ) as @xmath65       \\nonumber\\\\    & = \\int { \\rm d}{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\lambda$}}}}\\ , { \\rm d}{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$ } } } }         \\left[1 + \\frac{\\sigma s_3}{6}h_3(\\delta_l)\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\    &   \\qquad \\times\\    p_0({{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\lambda$}}}}|1 ) \\ ,       \\delta_{\\rm d}\\left[\\rho_s = \\rho_s'(\\sigma{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\lambda$}}}},{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$}}}})\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eqn : ecpdfrho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in practice , we construct the pdf by monte carlo solution of the integral . this is straightforward because the six independent components of the deformation tensor @xmath66 can be combined in the form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 the reason for doing this is that , to second order in @xmath0 , only @xmath69 has non - zero skewness @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can draw the other five parameters from gaussian distributions with variance @xmath70 the parameter @xmath69 is drawn from an edgeworth distribution .",
    "the associated @xmath71 can be computed by solving the eigenvalue problem and the nonlinear redshift pdf is then evaluated using equation  ( [ eqn : ecpdfrho ] ) .    in the next section",
    ", we compare this full solution with measurements in simulations .",
    "note however that , in the limit @xmath72 , the nonlinear redshift space pdf can be solved perturbatively .",
    "appendix  [ section : pt ] provides details and shows that , to lowest order , the variance in the redshift space counts is related to that in real space by kaiser s formula for @xmath10 ; the dependence on @xmath0 enters at higher order .",
    "we now compare the predictions of our model with measurements of the nonlinear pdf in numerical simulations from @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations followed the evolution of @xmath73 particles in a periodic cube of sides @xmath74 .",
    "the background cosmology was @xmath58cdm with @xmath75 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ecptr8 ] compares our model with the measured redshift space pdf of counts in @xmath76 spheres . in the upper panel ,",
    "the solid symbols show the pdf for @xmath10 .",
    "we have not shown results for @xmath77 in that panel since they only slightly differ from the gaussian case . instead , the symbols in the bottom panel show the fractional deviation in these models relative to the gaussian case .",
    "filled and open symbols are for @xmath78 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "as we can see , a positive @xmath0 slightly skews the pdf towards overdense regions .",
    "conversely , the fraction of underdense regions is enhanced for negative @xmath0 . in this respect ,",
    "the redshift space pdf shows the same qualitative dependence on @xmath0 as the real space pdf , as expected ( c.f .",
    "discussion following equation  [ eqn : ecpdfw ] ) .",
    "the dashed , solid , and dotted curves in the top panel show the predictions for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "the differences are small , so the curves appear almost identical , but the bottom panel shows that they are indeed slightly different from one another , and that our model provides a good description of the ratios , except in the high density tail where it underpredicts the dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "note however that , in this strongly nonlinear regime , our model drastically overpredicts the gaussian counts .",
    "we believe we understand why our model is more successful at predicting the ratio than the counts themselves .",
    "this is because at least some of the discrepancy at @xmath81 arises from the fact that the highly nonlinear virial motions within halos will act to erase large density contrasts ",
    "these motions are _ not _ part of our model .",
    "figures  1 and  2 in @xcite show that , for @xmath10 , virial motions reduce the @xmath81 tail , enhance the intermediate @xmath82 region of the pdf , and have almost no effect on the @xmath83 regime . removing virialized motions within halos from the measurements substantially reduces the discrepancy between theory and the simulations at @xmath84 . although virial motions do not depend on @xmath0 , their net effect depends upon the halo mass function . since the later",
    "does depend on @xmath0 , we may thus expect a slightly stronger suppression when @xmath85 ( as the abundance of massive halos is slightly enhanced ) . on the other hand , the real space pdf , which is also affected by virial motions ,",
    "has a more pronounced high density tail for @xmath85 . as a result ,",
    "the ratio of non - gaussian counts to gaussian counts depends only weakly on @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , our model can provide a reasonable description of the ratio even though it fails at describing the high @xmath9 tail of the gaussian density pdf .",
    "figure  [ fig : ecptr4 ] shows a similar comparison on smaller scales ( spheres of radius @xmath86mpc ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 is smaller compared to the previous figure .",
    "our model still provides a good description of the ratio relative to the @xmath10 counts , except at the highest densities where it overpredicts the @xmath10 counts and underpredicts the ratio .",
    "note again , that we expect much of this discrepancy to be reduced if we were to remove virial motions from the simulations .",
    "we used the ellipsoidal evolution model to study the redshift space probability distribution function of the nonlinear dark matter density field in the local non - gaussian @xmath0 model .    a perturbative analysis of the density pdf eq.([eqn : ecpdf ] )",
    "shows that , at the lowest order , kaiser s formula still holds in the @xmath0 model ( although his original derivation does not assume gaussianity explicitly , other derivations of the formula have done so , as discussed in the introduction ) .",
    "the effects of @xmath87 appear in the first order corrections to the variance ( and higher order moments ) .",
    "one could , therefore , constrain @xmath0 from large scale structure by measuring the variance and the higher order moments and comparing with the perturbative quantities in section  [ section : pt ] ( with some dynamical models to determine @xmath88 ) .",
    "our approach remains accurate on smaller scales where perturbative treatments are not useful .",
    "simulations show that the dependence on @xmath0 is qualitatively similar to that for the real space pdf : for positive @xmath0 ( positive @xmath44 ) both pdfs skew slightly towards overdense regions .",
    "in addition both show stronger @xmath0 dependence in the underdense regions , suggesting that void abundances should be good probes for primordial non - gaussianity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our model ( equation  [ eqn : ecpdfw ] ) captures these trends ( figures  [ fig : ecptr8 ] and  [ fig : ecptr4 ] ) .",
    "since it is explicitly a redshift space calculation , it would be interesting to see if it correctly predicts the @xmath0 dependence of the pdf of the flux in the ly-@xmath89 forest , that has recently been simulated by @xcite .",
    "this work also provides the foundation for constraining @xmath0 in future galaxy surveys ( e.g. the change in the redshift space halo / galaxy power spectrum by combining with the scale dependent halo / galaxy bias @xcite ) .",

    "note that setting @xmath87 simply changes the values of the averages over the @xmath100s .",
    "hence , to lowest order , @xmath101 this is kaiser s formula , so the relation between real and redshift space variance is unchanged from the gaussian case .      the origin of these terms can be understood as follows .",
    "when @xmath10 , then one can think of the three terms in kaisers expression as being due to the density - density , density - velocity and velocity - velocity power spectra .",
    "now , velocities are related to first derivatives of the potential , whereas densities are related to second derivatives .",
    "so one expects the lowest order corrections to the gaussian result to scale as @xmath0 .",
    "terms in the first order correction ( second equality in equation  [ eqn:2ndsig ] ) can be interpreted as @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath104 respectively , where @xmath107 denotes bispectra , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are density and velocity .",
    "notice that this first order correction in the redshift variance is of lower order compared to the case where @xmath10 ( and hence @xmath110 ) .",

    "this approach can be extended to estimate the real - redshift large scale relation in higher order statistics , for example the bispectrum of galaxies to constrain @xmath0 ( see for example , @xcite or more recently @xcite ) .",
    "however complications arise when one includes scale dependent halo / galaxy bias @xcite and the validity of the peak - background split approach in computing halo bias @xcite .",
    "these are beyond the scope of this paper and will be explored in future studies ."
