    "the photon is one of the fascinating objects that has been researched since einstein s introduction .",
    "usually , the currently accepted definition of photon is a monochromatic fourier mode for electromagnetic waves in the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "since arbitrary shapes of photonic modes can be generated by superposition of modes , this usually accepted definition has been successfully used to describe many different physical processes  @xcite .",
    "recently , the technology of dielectric material fabrication is able to handle small sample sizes , comparable to the wavelengths of light  @xcite .",
    "generation of a single photon inside the dielectric media and propagation through waveguide has been considered  @xcite . in that investigation ,",
    "a creation ( annihilation ) operator of the photon was used , which propagates to the right or left . since",
    "this system is a one - dimensional waveguide , @xmath0-type of modes are enough to handle problems for the generation and propagation of photons .",
    "although an integrated photonic crystal circuit operates at the single - photon level and is approximated as one - dimensional system , the actual phenomena occur in three dimensions .",
    "so , we need to treat the problem quantum - mechanically with maxwell s equations in three dimensions , or the second quantization method to describe photon s behavior inside the dielectric material . furthermore , from several formalisms  @xcite",
    ", we also need to discern a proper description for photon inside dielectric material by comparing experimentally verifiable quantities .",
    "to initiate such investigation , this paper has considered a simple model system to treat the generation , propagation , and detection of light inside a dielectric material .",
    "we have found that the spontaneous decay can induce exponentially localized modes , which are usually ignored in the propagation problem , and that there are two different decay rates for the space and time in their correlation function .",
    "though the exponentially localized modes satisfy the transversality condition , @xmath1 , they do not propagate  @xcite .",
    "so only the nonlocalized modes are propagating modes , which are present in the far - field region .",
    "however , in near field region the photon detector measures the whole electric field , and the distinction of propagating modes from the localized modes is not possible through photon detection .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the electric field operator using the second quantization method according to glauber s approach  @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we treat spontaneous emission in a two - level atom using the electric field operator derived in sec .",
    "finally , we calculate the spatio - temporal correlation function , and in sec .",
    "iv we summarize our conclusions .",
    "to see the effect of dielectric materials on photon emission , propagation , and detection , let s consider a rectangular waveguide filled by a dielectric material with constant electric permittivity @xmath2 and constant magnetic permeability @xmath3 . here , we choose a rectangular waveguide since it has a simple though nontrivial geometry . for simplicity , we consider that the dielectric material inside the waveguide is surrounded by a perfect electric conductor ( pec ) so that the tangential electric field at boundary is zero .",
    "let s put the waveguide along the @xmath4-axis , and the center of coordinates at the vertex of the rectangles with the length along @xmath5-axis as @xmath6 and that along @xmath7-axis as @xmath8 with @xmath9 , as shown in fig .",

    "the solutions of the wave - equation are divided into two types of modes : the transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes with @xmath31 , and the transverse electric ( te ) modes with @xmath32 .",
    "the field components for the tm modes are @xmath33 with positive integers @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and for te modes are @xmath36 with non - negative integers @xmath34 and @xmath35 without simultaneous @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the boundary conditions suggest that allowable @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "the propagating mode with the lowest cutoff frequency is a te mode with @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in the usual treatment of the propagation problem with",
    "injected light as input along the waveguide , the modes with exponential behavior ( @xmath43 ) have been excluded since they diverge at @xmath44 , and only the oscillating eigenmodes ( @xmath45 ) are considered , since they can propagate into the far - field region , where the detector is located . however , in our system the light is generated inside the dielectric material , and we want to solve a photon - generation problem in quantum mechanics .",
    "so , the usually ignored exponential decay modes can operate as one of the quantized modes , which can interact with the embedded atom . for a single atom located at @xmath46 ,",
    "the replacement of the exponential function @xmath20 into @xmath47 is an acceptable eigenmode with a singularity in first derivative at @xmath46 .",

    "since the integration along @xmath4-axis diverges for the propagating modes , we should be careful when carrying out the above integration along @xmath4-axis .",
    "similar to the vacuum mode , we might consider a periodicity along @xmath4-axis , and restrict the integration range @xmath68 $ ] for propagating modes .",
    "the normalization gives for a propagating tm mode ( @xmath69 ) @xmath70 for a localized tm mode ( @xmath43 ) @xmath71 for a propagating te mode ( @xmath69 ) @xmath72 and for a localized te mode ( @xmath43 ) @xmath73 with the cross - sectional area of the waveguide @xmath74 .",
    "since the periodicity @xmath75 is arbitrary , we need another condition for the summation over frequency for the propagating modes . for a description of photons in vacuum ,",
    "the summation index over states is wave - number @xmath76 , which satisfy periodicity @xmath77 with integers @xmath35 .",

    "then the arbitrary quantization length @xmath75 , shown in eqs .   and , will be canceled out by the @xmath75 in eq .   in the calculation of any physical observables .",
    "the localized modes show exponential decay along the @xmath4-direction , and depend on the position of the two - level atom . however , along the @xmath5- and @xmath7-axes they show an oscillatory behavior .",
