    "for many purposes , scattering amplitudes and the expectation values of gauge - theory wilson lines may be studied in momentum space or in coordinate space , although most fixed - order computations are carried out in momentum space . at the same time , a coordinate - space perspective may serve as a bridge between scattering amplitudes and certain observables , often those involving jets @xcite . similarly , analyses in coordinate space have played a central role in correspondences between gauge theories and gravity  @xcite , and dual conformal symmetries for select supersymmetric theories make a direct correspondence between choices of momenta for amplitudes and assignments of vertices for certain polygonal wilson loops @xcite .",
    "these considerations suggest that it may be useful to reexamine some of the all - orders properties of perturbative scattering amplitudes and cross sections that have been derived primarily from momentum - space analyses @xcite in terms of coordinate - space integrals . in this spirit , we argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the cusp formed by two wilson lines can be written in a geometrical form to all orders in perturbation theory , as a surface integral over an ultraviolet - finite function of the running coupling , whose scale varies with position on the surface .",

    "we work in feynman gauge , to preserve lorentz invariance and causality in the physical spacetime structure of the amplitudes we study .",
    "our construction is for gauge - theory amplitudes with the geometry of fixed - angle scattering , and so must overcome the complication that in gauge theories with massless particles almost any subdiagram may produce collinear singularities or take part in the underlying short - distance process , in different parts of the integration space .",

    "the leading singularity of the diagram requires that the light - cone singularity of each external propagator remains uncanceled .",

    "an infinitesimal gauge transformation produces a sum of terms in which either external propagators are canceled , or vectors are projected onto scalar polarizations , proportional to their own momenta .",
    "the fourier transformations of these relations are contributions in which an external propagator is replaced by a four - dimensional delta function , fixing its position at an internal vertex , or the divergence is taken of an external vector field , and hence a gradient of the external propagator .",
