    "on a large scale , star formation in galaxies appears to be regulated by the self - gravity of the gas , producing new stars at a rate proportional to the average gas density @xmath1 multiplied by the standard gravitational rate , @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to the schmidt law of star formation ( madore 1981 ; larson 1988 ; elmegreen 1991 ; kennicutt 1998 ) and the observation of a decreasing gas consumption time at higher densities , which is essentially the starburst phenomenon ( larson 1987 ; elmegreen 1994 ; kennicutt 1998 )",
    ".    large - scale star formation also has a density threshold ( madore , van den bergh , & rogstad 1974 ; gallagher & hunter 1984 ; guiderdoni 1987 ) , below which the rate per unit gas mass is much less than the inverse gravity time .",
    "this threshold has been attributed to several types of limits : ( 1 ) a minimum column density for strong self - gravity of a gas disk in the presence of galactic differential rotation , i.e. , @xmath3 ( toomre 1964 ; goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ; quirk 1972 ; fall & efstathiou 1980 ; zasov & simakov 1988 ; kennicutt 1989 ; elmegreen 1991 ) , and ( 2 ) a minimum column density corresponding to the minimum pressure ( which scales as @xmath4 ) that gives a cool thermal gas phase , @xmath5 \\right)^{0.5}\\left(i / i_\\odot\\right)^{0.6}$ ] m@xmath6 pc@xmath7 for radiation field @xmath8 relative to the local value , @xmath9 , total gas+stellar column density @xmath10 , and ratio of thermal to total gas pressure , @xmath11 ( elmegreen & parravano 1994 ) .",
    "the outer edges of galaxies where star formation slows abruptly ( ferguson et al .",
    "1998 ) are probably the result of contributions from both factors , considering that gaseous self - gravity becomes low ( kennicutt 1989 ) and the hi becomes nearly pure warm - phase ( braun 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the outer parts of galaxies are beyond the realm of strong stellar density waves , particularly outside the outer lindblad resonance for the dominant pattern speed of spiral wave modes in the disk ( bertin et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the absence of stellar density waves removes one of the primary mechanisms for organizing the gas into star - forming clouds .    on smaller scales",
    ", there is a correspondence between the duration of star formation in a region and the turbulent crossing time ( efremov & elmegreen 1998 ) , which suggests that self - gravity and turbulence together partition the gas into clouds and cloud clumps , and that the clouds are rather transient , turning into stars quickly before a chaotic turbulent boundary destroys the favorable environment ( e.g. , see turbulence simulations in ballesteros - paredes , vzquez - semadeni & scalo 1998 ) . the observation of similar initial stellar mass functions in clusters ( massey 1998 ) and in integrated galactic light ( bresolin & kennicutt 1997 ) is consistent with this turbulent time scale , because it implies that intermediate and high mass stars are not the primary agents of destruction for molecular clouds .",
    "such destruction would steepen the combined imf from all clouds above the salpeter power - law slope of @xmath12 to a slope of @xmath13 ( elmegreen 1998 , 1999 ) , which is observed only rarely in remote regions of the field ( massey et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "also consistent with this short time scale is the common observation that young or embedded star clusters still contain significant subclustering , presumably from the pre - stellar cloud .",
    "all of this stellar substructure would have been mixed together if the cluster age were much more than a crossing time .",
    "examples of young clusters with small - scale subclustering are w33 ( beck et al .",
    "1998 ) , g 35.20 - 1.74 ( persi et al . 1997 ) , ic 348 ( lada & lada 1995 ) , ngc 2264 ( piche 1993 ) , and many other clusters in the large magellanic clouds ( elson 1991 ) .",
    "these observations are useful for understanding the connection between large and small scale star formation .",
    "stars form in self - gravitating clouds on a wide range of scales , but the density of these clouds increases , and the gravitational time scale decreases , for smaller scales , probably because of the way turbulence structures the gas .",
    "this structure is also hierarchical , so many small regions of star formation come and go while the large region enclosing them continues to form stars . as a result , _",
    "the large scale controls the overall star formation time , while the smaller scales determine the net efficiency _ ,",
    "i.e. , the fraction of the gas that is turned into stars in all of the transient small scale events .",
    "the surface density threshold for star formation has been observed for a wide variety of regions , including normal spiral galaxies ( kennicutt 1989 ; caldwell et al .",
    "1992 ) , low surface brightness galaxies ( van der hulst et al .",
    "1993 ) , starbursts ( shlosman & begelman 1989 ; kennicutt 1998 ) and embedded gas disks in elliptical galaxies ( vader & vigroux 1991 ) . however , in all cases considered so far , the geometry has been either disk - like , as for large parts of galaxies , or ring - like , as in some nuclear starbursts ( elmegreen 1994 ) . a threshold for star formation in spheroidal systems like dwarf galaxies and galactic bulges",
    "has not been seriously considered .",
    "nevertheless , the basic principles of star formation that have been derived for disk galaxies should also have applications in other regions , including the galactic bulge , as long as the three - dimensional geometry for self - gravity and various turbulent and magnetic processes are properly considered .",
    "here we discuss theoretical and observational evidence that the criterion for star formation underlying most of the galactic observations is one in which the _ volume _ density of gas is comparable to or larger than the total virial density in that region , including stars and dark matter .",
    "this threshold has already been suggested for dwarf and irregular galaxies ( elmegreen et al . 1996 ) .",
    "it also has a natural extension to three dimensions , and therefore should be appropriate to the formation of galactic bulges .",
    "in addition , we suggest that the likely formation time of the bulge was only a few dynamical times , as it is in local molecular clouds , and that this short time leads to bulge formation luminosities that are extremely large , consistent with observations of galaxies at high @xmath14 ( giavalisco et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ; steidel et al .",
    "moreover , the pressures resulting from star formation give an interesting condition for self - regulation and blow - out that depends only on the depth of the potential well .",
    "this condition is such that normal galaxy disks and dwarf galaxies can regulate their star formation to remain near or below the threshold , but galactic bulges and whole elliptical galaxies can not .",
    "another implication of using normal star formation processes for galactic bulges is the prediction that stars should form in numerous dense clusters .",
    "the remnants of these clusters might be visible today as stellar streams or other concentrations in phase space , and as bulge ( and halo ) globulars .",
    "spitzer ( 1942 ) noted the existence of a maximum stable gas mass for a given temperature in a fixed background potential from stars . this maximum mass corresponds to a threshold ratio of the gas density to the virial density . above this density ,",
    "gas pressure can not support a cloud against the combined gravity from itself and the background stars .",
    "some applications of this three - dimensional threshold density have already been made for dwarf and irregular galaxies .",
    "the sizes of the largest regions of star formation ( `` star complexes '' ) in dwarf , irregular , and spiral galaxies spanning a factor of @xmath15 in luminosity were found to always equal half the jeans length for a fixed gaseous velocity dispersion of @xmath16 km s@xmath17 , provided the gas density is comparable to the background virial density that is given by the tully - fisher relations between galaxy size , dynamical velocity , and absolute magnitude ( elmegreen et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this implies that when the gas density exceeds the virial density , star formation begins on a scale equal to the jeans length .",
    "these results are interesting here because dwarf galaxies are not thin disks and they have no spiral density waves .",
    "thus the star formation threshold for dwarfs might be similar to that for other three - dimensional structures .",
    "spitzer s derivation was based on the virial theorem .",
    "it gave the result that an isothermal gas cloud embedded in a stellar spheroid is unstable if its central density @xmath18 exceeds @xmath19 for gaseous gravitational potential @xmath20 .",
    "we recalculate this result here by direct integration of the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium for a mixture of cool gas and a dissipationless fluid that might be considered to be stars , dark matter , or both . here",
    "we just call the second component dark matter",
    ". the equations of equilibrium are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the gravitational acceleration comes from both components according to poisson s equation in spherical coordinates : @xmath23 .",
    "the results are normalized to the central dark matter density , @xmath24 , the dark matter velocity dispersion , @xmath25 , and the gravitational length and mass scales given by these quantities , namely , @xmath26 and @xmath27^{1/2}g^{3/2}\\rho_{dm,0}^{1/2}\\right)$ ] , respectively .",
    "the top left diagram of figure 1 plots various density profiles for dark matter ( dashed lines ) and gas ( solid lines ) , considering different central gas densities .",
    "the lower dashed line corresponds to the upper solid line .",
    "the top right diagram shows the total gas mass as a function of the central gas density , for various ratios of the gaseous velocity dispersion to the dark matter dispersion . when the gaseous velocity dispersion is small , the total gas mass peaks at intermediate values of the central gas density .",
    "this is because at lower gas density the gas sphere has a low density throughout a large size , and at higher gas density , the gas sphere has a high density throughout a small size . as the gaseous dispersion approaches the stellar dispersion , however , the total mass of the gas sphere approaches infinity , as does the mass of the stellar sphere , because of the usual infinite extent of isothermal sphere solutions .",
    "the lower left diagram in figure 1 shows the peak total gas mass versus the velocity dispersion ratio as a solid line , and the ratio of the total gas mass to the dark matter mass inside the gas sphere as a dashed line .",
    "the gas mass ratio is about @xmath28 at low dispersion ratio .",
    "the final result is the gas density ratio , plotted in the lower right .",
    "when the central gas density exceeds about 12.6 times the central dark mass density , or the average gas density inside the half - mass gas radius exceeds about 6 times the central dark matter density , there are no stable solutions which permit the addition of more mass to a cool gas component of a gas+dark matter galaxy .",
    "any additional gas mass leads to catastrophic collapse of the whole gas sphere .",
    "if write the total gas+dark matter density as the virial density , then this result gives a critical average gas density @xmath29    this is about the same value as the critical gas density in spiral disks .",
    "the disk condition , from kennicutt ( 1989 ) , is usually written in terms of the surface density , @xmath30 for a flat rotation curve with speed @xmath31 and radius @xmath32 , the epicyclic frequency @xmath33 . to get the virial density ,",
    "we take @xmath34 .",
    "the surface density gets converted into a volume density using the scale height @xmath35 , as @xmath36 .",
    "the scale height for gas is about @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the total midplane density , including stars .",
    "thus @xmath39 .",
    "locally , @xmath40 g @xmath41 for @xmath42 km s@xmath17 and @xmath43 kpc ; this is about @xmath44 the total midplane density , so we take @xmath45 as representative .",
    "then @xmath46    the virial density is a reasonable threshold for major events of galactic star formation because the main processes that resist gaseous self - gravity in disks , namely , shear and rotation , have effective time scales ( oort @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ) that equal approximately @xmath49 . gaseous self - gravity , on the other hand , has an effective time scale of @xmath50 .",
    "thus self - gravity dominates when @xmath51 over a length scale larger than the jeans length .",
    "the interstellar magnetic field will not change this result much if it is in equipartition with the turbulent motions , because the first step in cloud formation following a gravitational instability consists of motions along the magnetic field , and the field pressure does not resist this motion much .",
    "spiral waves in disks may trigger substantial amounts of star formation , even in sub - critical disks , but since the wave incidence rate is on the order of a rotation rate , the net time scale for star formation , averaged over a rotation , is still about the orbit time ( wyse & silk 1989 ) .",
    "in addition , spiral waves seem to require dense gas for strong amplification ( lubow , cowie , & balbus 1986 ) , so again we get the result that when the gas density is near the threshold for strong self - gravity , at @xmath52 , star formation , even in spiral density waves , becomes rapid .",
    "considering the above discussion , the threshold star formation rate per unit volume in any region will be about equal to the threshold gas density , which is essentially the local virial density , divided by the local dynamical time , or @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fraction of the gas that is turned into stars in each major star formation event ( given by the combined efficiencies of star formation on smaller scales ) .",
    "the dynamical time is @xmath55 . for @xmath56 years",
    ", this rate becomes @xmath57    meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found an upper limit to the areal star formation rate in starburst nuclear disks that is equal to @xmath58 m@xmath6 kpc@xmath7 yr@xmath17 .",
    "this comes from equation [ eq : sfrt ] if we multiply the volume star formation rate by a galactic thickness of @xmath59 kpc , use @xmath54 , and take a dynamical time appropriate for a nuclear disk , @xmath60 my .",
    "equation [ eq : sfrt ] predicts that even higher star formation rates will be found in smaller regions where @xmath61 is smaller , although the fraction of galaxies undergoing such intense bursts will be small because of rapid gas consumption during the active phase .",
    "meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also discussed wind limitations to star formation rates .",
    "they estimated the pressure from a star - forming region to be @xmath62 this pressure is proportional to the two - dimensional star formation rate , @xmath63 , which is the galactic thickness @xmath64 times the 3-dimensional rate from equation [ eq : sfr ] .",
    "thus , at threshold ( in cgs units ) , @xmath65    this disruptive pressure should be compared with the self - gravitational pressure that holds the region together , which is proportional to the square of the mass column density . for a disk , @xmath66 for total column density in the gas layer ,",
    "this equation follows from the use of @xmath67 for gas disk scale height @xmath35 and from the relation @xmath68 ; then @xmath69 , as expected .",
    "if we take @xmath52 at threshold , and @xmath45 as above , then @xmath70 for a sphere , @xmath71 again if we define @xmath72 in the same way . but",
    "now @xmath73 for the problem considered in figure 1 , and @xmath52 inside the half - mass radius .",
    "thus @xmath74 to cover both cases , we write this pressure as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 for a disk , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 for a sphere .",
    "now we see that the star formation pressure exceeds the self - gravitational binding pressure when @xmath80 the coefficient 1.7 is the average between @xmath81 for a disk and @xmath82 for a sphere .",
    "the coefficient on the left is in cgs units , namely , cm s@xmath17 .",
    "thus star formation pressure can blow apart a region at the threshold density if the gaseous velocity dispersion , in km s@xmath17 , is less than a certain limit , @xmath83    this limit is surprisingly simple : for typical @xmath54 , it says that star formation can regulate or stop itself in a disk ( e.g. , franco & shore 1984 ) or dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ) where the gaseous velocity dispersion is low , @xmath84 km s@xmath17 , but it can not regulate or stop itself in a young galactic bulge or elliptical galaxy , where the velocity dispersion from the potential well is large , @xmath85 km s@xmath17 . star formation might also fail to regulate itself in nuclear disks or interacting galaxies , which have large gaseous velocity dispersions too ( elmegreen et al . 1993 ; irwin 1994 ; elmegreen et al . 1995 ; brinks et al .",
    "1997 ; kaufman et al .",
    "1997 ) . such failure to self - regulate should lead to rapid and intense star formation on a time scale of only a few dynamical times .",
    "rapid star formation in bulges and elliptical systems also leads to large luminosities .",
    "we convert the star formation rate from equation [ eq : sfrt ] to a volume emissivity @xmath86 , following meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and get @xmath87 this expression may be used to get the total luminosity by multiplying it by the volume , @xmath88 for radius @xmath32 , and then the result can be written as a function of the dynamical speed , @xmath31 , using @xmath89 .",
    "the resultant luminosity is @xmath90    evidently , the threshold starburst luminosity also depends only on the depth of the potential well of the galaxy .",
    "this result should apply to many types of systems , since we have assumed very little about the nature of the star formation or how the gas got into the potential well .",
    "for merging galaxies , the dynamical speed can be @xmath91 km s@xmath17 or more , leading to star - formation luminosities of @xmath92 l@xmath6 for times of @xmath93 years ( @xmath94 years if the residual gas from inefficient star formation continues to make stars ) . for bulges",
    "in which @xmath95 km s@xmath17 , the luminosity during bulge formation can be @xmath96 l@xmath6 for a total formation time of @xmath97 years .",
    "these values are consistent with observations of the lyman @xmath98 emitting galaxy at @xmath99 found by giavalisco et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who suggest they are witnessing the formation of a galactic bulge or elliptical galaxy ( see also lilly 1999 ) .",
    "according to this theory , the formation of a typical galactic bulge could be all over within @xmath100 million years once it starts , i.e. , within @xmath101 for a complete conversion of gas into stars .",
    "this result is consistent with recent observations of rapid bulge formation in the milky way ( renzini 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of a critical density for star formation in three - dimensional systems implies that there should have been a delay in the onset of bulge formation during part of the accretion and cooling phase of the galactic gas near the center .",
    "star formation had to wait until the accretion built up a gas density in the center comparable to @xmath102 the density of dark matter there .",
    "after this critical density was reached , star formation should have been extremely rapid , producing @xmath103 l@xmath6 for @xmath104 years and then dying off ( depending on the rate of continued gas accretion ) .",
    "the bulge should not have been able to regulate this rapid star formation by supernovae , winds or other young stellar pressures , because the total binding pressure exceeded the star formation pressure .",
    "any winds that were generated had to move between the dense gas clumps and find their way out of the bulge in streams without completely expelling these clumps from the system .",
    "this starburst model of bulge formation differs from the model by wada , habe & sofue ( 1995 ) , who suggested that a nuclear starburst ejects a giant gas bubble , which forms stars and relaxes into a bulge .",
    "it also differs from other bulge formation models in which the bulge stars are ejected individually from the disk as a result of bar - driven or other resonances ( combes et al .",
    "1990 ; pfenniger & friedli 1991 ; friedli & benz 1995 ) , or ejected in bulk when a bar dissolves ( hasan , pfenniger , & norman 1993 ; friedli & benz 1993 ) . in the present model , the bulge formed in a three - dimensional distribution ( eggen , lynden - bell , and sandage 1962 ) as it does in the clusters of local molecular clouds , except on a much larger scale . a prediction of this model can then be made by analogy to all other known star formation : _ the bulge should have been born with an extremely clumpy distribution of young stars _ ,",
    "i.e. , composed almost entirely of clusters with a hierarchical distribution and a mass function something like @xmath105 ( fleck 1996 ; elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ) .",
    "presumably some of these clusters remain today as globular clusters ( surdin 1979 ; okazaki & tosa 1995 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) , but most should have been dissolved by interactions and variable tidal forces ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . in that case , they may still be observable as stellar streams , which are concentrations in phase space .",
    "this was apparently the fate of local disk star clusters that were dispersed with age ( eggen 1989 ; dehnen 1998 ) .",

    "<S> properties of normal galactic star formation , including the density dependence , threshold density , turbulent scaling relations , and clustering properties , are applied to the formation of galactic bulges . </S>",
    "<S> one important difference is that the bulge potential well is too deep to have allowed self - regulation or blow - out by the pressures from young stars , unlike galactic disks or dwarf galaxies . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , bulge formation should have been at the maximum rate , which is such that most of the gas would get converted into stars in only a few dynamical time scales , or @xmath0 years . </S>",
    "<S> the gas accretion phase can be longer than this , but once the critical density is reached , which depends primarily on the total virial density from dark matter , the formation of stars in the bulge should have been extremely rapid . </S>",
    "<S> such three - dimensional star formation should also have formed many clusters , like normal disk star formation today . </S>",
    "<S> some of these clusters may have survived as old globulars , but most got dispersed , although they might still be observable as concentrated streams in phase space .    </S>",
