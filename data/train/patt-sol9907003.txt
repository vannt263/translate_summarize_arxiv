    "<S> we consider a curved chain of nonlinear oscillators and show that the interplay of curvature and nonlinearity leads to a symmetry breaking when an asymmetric stationary state becomes energetically more favorable than a symmetric stationary state . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the energy of localized states decreases with increasing curvature , i.e. bending is a trap for nonlinear excitations . </S>",
    "<S> a violation of the vakhitov - kolokolov stability criterion is found in the case where the instability is due to the softening of the peierls internal mode .    2    nanoscale physical systems such as biological macromolecules , nanotubes , microtubules , vesicles , electronic and photonic wave - guide structures @xcite are usually objects with nontrivial geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the gene transcription is usually accompanied by a local dna bending @xcite ; the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes drastically depend on their chirality @xcite ; t - shape junctions were recently proposed @xcite as nanoscale metal - semiconductor - metal contact devices . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry manifests itself in particular in creation of linear quasi - bound states ( see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the competition between nonlinearity and dispersion likewise results into localization of energy . taken together these two localization mechanisms </S>",
    "<S> are competitive and one might expect that the _ interplay of geometry and nonlinearity can lead to qualitatively new effects_. an example of _ nonlinearity - induced change of the geometry of the system _ is found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where the classical heisenberg model on a two - dimensional manifold was considered . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that a periodic topological spin soliton induces a periodic pinch of the cylindric manifold .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) models on a curved one - dimensional manifold and show that the competition between curvature and nonlinearity leads to a qualitatively new effect : _ curvature - induced symmetry breaking for non - topological solitary excitations_. this effect is inherent for both continuum and discrete nls models . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the discrete nls equation @xmath0 which describes a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators , @xmath1 being the complex amplitude at the site @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . in the theory of charge ( energy ) </S>",
    "<S> transfer @xmath1 is the wave function of the carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath4 and the number of excitations ( quanta ) @xmath5 are conserved quantities . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nls ] ) the nonlinear term @xmath6 represents a self - interaction of the quasiparticle ( anharmonicity of vibrations ) . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation transfer @xmath7 in the coupling term depends on the distance in the embedding space between the sites @xmath2 and @xmath8 : @xmath9 , where the radius - vector @xmath10 characterizes the position of the site @xmath2 on the manifold . </S>",
    "<S> the sites are assumed to be equidistantly placed on plane envelope curve ( fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : chain ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this model is closely related to the so - called wormlike inextensible chain model @xcite which is abundantly used in polymer dynamics ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the properties of nonlinear excitations in the vicinity of a smooth bend where the curve can be modeled by the parabola without loss of generality ( as done in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chain ] ) : @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the inverse radius of curvature at the bending point . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between neighboring sites is assumed to be independent on the curvature @xmath13 : @xmath14 ( inextensibility of the chain ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the excitation dynamics would not depend on the curvature of the system in the _ nearest - neighbor approximation _ </S>",
    "<S> , when @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> in many physical problems , however , the nearest - neighbor approximation is too crude . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the dna molecule contains charged groups , and therefore the vibration - excitation transfer is due to the dipole - dipole interaction decaying with the distance @xmath16 as @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> effective dispersive interaction between nonlinear layers in nonlinear dielectric superlattices is exponential , @xmath18 , with the inverse radius @xmath19 depending on parameters of the lattice ( superlattice spacing , linear refractive index and so on ) @xcite . with this in mind </S>",
    "<S> one can see that in general case the number of neighbors available for excitation is larger near the bending point than far away from it . </S>",
    "<S> this gives birth , in particular , to an effective double - well potential @xmath20 ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : chain ] and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamc ] ) ) which is basically responsible for the effects discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigated both @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> but in this paper we discuss in detail the first case only . </S>",
    "<S> it is known @xcite that in the case of straight line ( @xmath23 ) such nls model exhibits ( for @xmath24 ) bistability in the spectrum of nonlinear stationary states . to distinguish these effects from the finite curvature effects we use @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we study stationary states of the system @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the nonlinear frequency and @xmath28 is the amplitude in the @xmath2-th site .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : norm ] shows @xmath29 versus @xmath27 obtained numerically for the straight chain and curved chain . </S>",
    "<S> several new features arise as a consequence of the finite curvature :    * _ there is a gap _ at small @xmath27 in which no localized excitation can exist . </S>",
    "<S> this gap originates from the existence of a curvature created _ linear two - hump localized mode_. the gap increases when the curvature @xmath13 increases . </S>",
    "<S> * there are _ two branches of stationary states _ : a branch of symmetric localized excitations ( s ) , which exists for all values of @xmath29 , and a branch of _ asymmetric localized excitations _ ( as ) , which exists only for @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold value @xmath31 decreases when @xmath13 decreases and vanishes in the limit @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetric stationary state has a two - humped shape ( evolved from the linear two - hump localized mode ) while in the asymmetric state the maximum is shifted either to the left or to the right from the center of symmetry @xmath33 ( see inset in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : norm ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> * for the symmetric stationary states @xmath34 is _ non - monotonic _ as in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for nls models on the straight chain with the radius of the dispersive interaction above a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in the case of curved chain there is an interval of @xmath29 in which three different symmetric states coexist for each excitation number . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account that for the inverse radius @xmath25 under investigation there is no bistability in the straight chain ( see dot - dashed line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : norm ] ) , one may conclude that _ bistability is facilitated in the systems with finite curvature_.    the linear stability of the stationary states is investigated ( as it is described in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) letting @xmath35 \\ , \\exp(i\\lambda t)$ ] and linearizing eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nls ] ) with respect to @xmath36 . by definition </S>",
    "<S> the stationary state @xmath28 is linearly stable if @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : omega ] shows the spectrum of linear excitations around the symmetric localized state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there are two localized internal modes : peierls antisymmetric mode ( p ) and breathing symmetric mode ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are two intervals of instability of the symmetric stationary state : when @xmath38 the instability is due to the breathing internal mode . in this part of the curve @xmath34 ( dashed line in the inset ) @xmath39 and the instability agrees with the vakhitov - kolokolov stability criterion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath40 the stationary state is unstable with respect to the peierls mode ( the corresponding part of @xmath34 is marked by the dotted line ) . in this latter case </S>",
    "<S> _ we observe a violation of the vakhitov - kolokolov stability criterion _ because this instability interval corresponds to a part of the curve @xmath34 where @xmath41 ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : norm ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the symmetric as well as asymmetric localized states is monotonically decreasing function of the curvature ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : energy ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one may expect that the _ nonlinear localized excitation may facilitate bending of flexible molecular chain_. for @xmath30 , when symmetric and asymmetric stationary states coexist , the _ asymmetric state is always energetically more favorable_. taking into account that in the linear limit the ground state of the model is symmetric with respect to the center of symmetry @xmath33 one can conclude that _ combined action of the finite curvature and nonlinearity provides the symmetry breaking _ in the system . a typical evolution of the curved nls model in the case when the symmetric stationary state becomes unstable is shown in fig . [ fig : dynamics ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the two - humped initial symmetric state evolves into an asymmetric state with an excited breathing internal mode .    apart from the smooth bending we studied the case of the edge : @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively the same results were obtained for this case , too .    to clarify the physical meaning of obtained results we pass to the continuum limit of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ham ] ) where the hamiltonian @xmath43 can be represented as @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the arclength ( the continuum analogue of @xmath2 ) , @xmath46 is the square of the dispersive length of the excitation , and @xmath47 is the energy shift due to the coherent interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse length @xmath48 and attractive potential @xmath49 are generally double - well functions . at the bottom of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chain ] the discrete analogue of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , is shown . in the vicinity of the bend </S>",
    "<S> there are two symmetric sections of the chain in which the number of neighbors entering into the range of the dispersive interaction , @xmath51 , is higher than anywhere else on the chain . in this way a double - well potential structure results . </S>",
    "<S> the positions and depths of the wells are determined by the range of the dispersive interaction and the peculiarities of the bending geometry . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , in the case of the edge , @xmath52 , we get for small @xmath53 + @xmath54 + and @xmath55 . + </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the hamiltonian similar to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamc ] ) with @xmath56 was introduced in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to study the effects of the dna bending on breather trapping . </S>",
    "<S> the step function dependence of the dispersive length @xmath57 was there postulated . in all cases bending </S>",
    "<S> manifests itself as a trap for nonlinear excitations . to obtain an analytical solution of the problem one can approximate @xmath57 by a constant and @xmath49 by two @xmath58-functions . </S>",
    "<S> then we arrive at the following minimal model @xmath59 is the depth of the well . introducing into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ toy ] ) the stationary state ansatz @xmath60 we find that the corresponding nonlinear eigenvalue problem can be easily reduced to an algebraic one . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the analytical consideration are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : toy ] . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary state ( s ) is unique and symmetric for small number of quanta @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> but when the number of quanta exceeds some critical value there are two stationary states : symmetric ( s ) and asymmetric ( as ) , with the asymmetric state being energetically favorable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , similarly to the original model , the minimal model demonstrates a symmetry breaking effect ( localization in one of the wells ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in the nls model the interplay of curvature and nonlinearity leads to the symmetry breaking when the asymmetric stationary state becomes energetically favorable than the symmetric one . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the energy of localized states decreases with the increasing of curvature . </S>",
    "<S> one may expect that the nonlinear localized excitation may facilitate bending of a flexible molecular chain . in all cases bending </S>",
    "<S> manifests itself as a trap for nonlinear excitations . for the curved nls model in the case of the physically important dipole - dipole dispersive interaction @xmath61 qualitatively the same properties </S>",
    "<S> are found . using as an example the davydov - scott model @xcite with the dipole - dipole coupling between sites @xcite for the parameters which characterize the motion of the amide - i excitation in proteins ( they correspond to @xmath62 in our model ) decreasing of the ground state energy due to a trapping by the bending with @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) comprise @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) of the whole excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> this may be also important for the dynamics of dna molecule where as was mentioned above the vibration - excitations are described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nls ] ) with the dipole - dipole dispersive interaction @xcite . finally , a violation of the vakhitov - kolokolov stability criterion in the case when the instability is due to the softening of the peierls internal mode is found . </S>"
