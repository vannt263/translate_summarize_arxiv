    "the dark cloud l1287 contains the galactic nebulae gn 00.34.0 ( associated with the young f - type star rno 1 ) and gn 00.33.9 which harbors the iras point source iras 00338 + 6312 ( @xmath0 pc , * ? ? ?",
    "two young stars , rno 1b and rno 1c , lie slightly south - west of the catalog position of the iras source . those objects show properties of fu orionis objects ( fuors ) : ( 1 ) @xcite found that rno 1b brightened by at least 3 mag over a period of 12 years and that it showed a variable and blueshifted p cygni profile in h@xmath1 and additional broad and double  peaked absorption lines in its optical spectrum ; ( 2 ) @xcite obtained near  infrared spectroscopic data for both objects and found the fuor  typical strong 2.3@xmath2 m co absorption bands . as the error ellipse of",
    "the iras source includes both fuors it was long debated whether there is still another deeply embedded source close to the fuor objects or whether iras just measured the integrated flux from these two objects . from high  resolution near ",
    "infrared ( nir ) polarimetric maps @xcite concluded that an additional embedded object should be present close to the location of the iras source .",
    "this idea was supported by the discovery of a 3.6 cm continuum peak @xcite and an h@xmath3o maser @xcite , both nearly coinciding with the iras position .",
    "a bipolar outflow in the region was found by @xcite and later confirmed by @xcite . as the positions of the iras source and the fuors line up along the outflow axis it has long been uncertain which source was driving the outflow . from interferometric observations in cs @xcite suggested that the iras source was most likely the driving source .",
    "recently , @xcite mapped the outflow in co and came to the same conclusion .",
    "however , @xcite presented ( sub)millimeter observations favoring rno 1c as the outflow driving source .",
    "in this paper we present mid  infrared ( mir ) imaging and spectroscopy data taken with the _ irac _ and _ irs _ instruments onboard the _",

    "the two _ irs _ spectra probe the composition of the dense circumstellar environment in the vicinity of rno 1b/1c and bear additional traces of shocked h@xmath3 gas .",

    "overplotting the spectral slits of _ irs _ on the 2mass ks - filter image reveals that apparently rno 1b and rno 1c were not centered within the slits ( fig .  [ slits ] ) .",
    "the short low  resolution spectrum ( @xmath6 @xmath2 m , r @xmath7 ) and the short high  resolution spectrum ( @xmath8 @xmath2 m , r @xmath9 ) close to rno 1b seems to probe mainly flux coming from in between the two objects .",
    "the spectrum close to rno 1c contains presumably also less flux than expected due to the slight mispointing .",
    "the long high  resolution part in either spectrum ( @xmath10 @xmath2 m , r @xmath9 ) includes flux from both components and also additional flux from the iras source as all three objects lie within the slit of the spectrograph .",
    "the _ irac _ images were reduced with the mopex package provided by the _",

    "the background was subtracted using associated pairs of imaged spectra from the two nodded positions along the slit .",

    "the high  resolution spectra were extracted with the full aperture size ( 53.11 arcsec@xmath16 for the short  high and 247.53 arcsec@xmath16 for the long  high module ) .",
    "the sky contribution was estimated by fitting a continuum to the data . both , the low and high  resolution spectra , are calibrated using a spectral response function derived from irs spectra appropriate for the two nod positions in the slit at which we extract the specta , and cohen or marcs stellar models for a suite of calibrators provided by the",
    "_ spitzersciencecentre_. the multiple orders in our spectra match to within 10% .",
    "these small flux offsets are likely related to small pointing offsets .",
    "we computed correction factors for possible flux loss due to telescope mispointing based on the psf of the _ irs _ instrument .",
    "however , accurate results can only be obtained if the flux is dominated by one source .",
    "the offsets also result in low level fringing at wavlengths longer than 20 micron in the low  resolution spectra and at all wavelengths in the high  resolution spectra .",
    "we removed these fringes using the irsfringe package developed by f. lahuis .",
    "the relative errors between spectral points within one order are dominated by the noise on each individual point and not by the calibration . based on our experience with _ spitzer irs _ data",
    "we estimate a relative flux calibration error across a spectral order of @xmath17  % and an absolute calibration error between orders / modules of @xmath18  % .",
    "these values , however , are based on point source observations with accurate telescope pointing .",
    "the data presented here are more complicated as at least part of the emission is moderately extended , multiple sources contribute to the observed fluxes , each contribution is wavelength dependent , and the telescope slits were not centered on the main objects .",
    "thus , an accurate flux calibration between the different modules is difficult and apparent offsets are further discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "within the limited field  of  view of the _ irac _ subarray mode we identified 8 sources that were detected in at least three of the four _ irac _ bands .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] provides a comparison between the rno 1b/1c region as seen in the 2mass ks - filter and the 5.8@xmath2 m _ irac _ filter . for the first time the mir point source related to iras 00338 + 6312 is detected in the _ irac _ band .",
    "additional fainter objects are also present , some of which are detected for the first time .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows a color composite image of the rno 1b/1c complex based on three _ irac _ filters .",
    "table  [ irac_fluxes ] lists all objects that were identified in at least three _ irac _ bands and summarizes the derived fluxes .",
    "the errors are based on the results from the psf - photometry . since we used the psf of rno 1c as reference",
    "psf the corresponding errors are relatively small compared to the other objects .",
    "iras 00338 + 6312 and rno 1 g were not detected in the shortest _ irac _ band at 3.6@xmath2 m .",
    "the 2mass image in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that at least the iras source is deeply embedded in a dense dusty environment explaining the non - detection at this wavelength .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows two color  color plots based on the four _ irac _ bands for all objects listed in table  [ irac_fluxes ] .",
    "following @xcite who analyzed a large sample of pre - main sequence stars in the taurus star - forming region we use these plots to classify the different objects .",
    "the colors of the reddest objects ( iras 00338 + 6312 and rno 1 g ) are consistent with very young protostars .",
    "the colors of the newly discovered objects rno1 irac1 and rno1 irac3 are consistent with class 0/i systems although it has to be confirmed that these are indeed nearby objects and not highly reddened background sources . while the colors of the fuor object rno 1c fit in the region of class ii objects from @xcite in both plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , rno 1b fits only in one color - color diagram into this regime . in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] rno 1b is too red for a class ii source in the [ 4.5]-[5.8 ] color , but not red enough in the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color to be a class 0/i object . finally ,",
    "rno1 irac 2 and rno 1f , which both show up in the 2mass ks - band image , can also be interpreted as class ii objects .",
    "however , the colors of rno1 irac2 , but partly also of rno 1f , are possibly altered due to local extinction effects .      in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the _ spitzer irs _ spectra without any extinction correction .",
    "as pointed out earlier the spectral slits of the short wavelength modules were apparently not directly centered on the objects rno 1b and rno 1c and thus the measured fluxes can not be attributed to these objects with very high accuracy .",
    "also , there seems to be an offset in the flux in the high  resolution regime compared to the low  resolution part of the spectrum . to see to which extent this effect is caused by different aperture sizes we plotted the spectra in intensities (",
    "i.e. , flux density per solid angle ) rather then in jansky per wavelength .",
    "it shows , however , that even after this correction significant offsets remain : around 13@xmath2 m the difference between the low  resolution spectrum and the short high  resolution spectrum amounts to a factor of @xmath19@xmath20 and @xmath19@xmath21 for rno 1b and rno 1c , respectively , with the high  resolution part showing higher intensities .",
    "at least for the rno1 b spectrum this offset is larger than normally expected from the calibration accuracy .",
    "we thus believe that part of this offset can be attributed to the different orientations of the spectral slits on the sky probing different regions of the extended emission .",
    "the offset between the short and long wavelength range of the high  resolution data corresponds to factors of @xmath19@xmath22 and @xmath19@xmath23 at 20@xmath2 m for rno 1b and rno 1c , respectively .",
    "also here the short high  resolution spectrum shows higher intensities .",
    "this can be explained by the approximately five times smaller aperture in the short high  resolution module .",
    "although this aperture is probing a significantly smaller regions on the sky these regions do presumably contribute in total to flux in the above mentioned wavelength regime .",
    "the large aperture of the long high  resolution module on the other hand is certainly also probing regions without any significant flux ( see also , fig .  [ slits ] )",
    ".      at 6@xmath2 m both spectra show clear water ice absorption bands . at slightly longer wavelength ( @xmath246.85@xmath2 m )",
    "additional absorption possibly arising from ch@xmath25oh ice is present @xcite .",
    "the 10@xmath2 m silicate band is also seen in absorption in both spectra ( stronger close to rno 1c ) , although the shape of the feature differs from the absorption feature caused by typical interstellar medium silicate grains . to analyze the differences in more detail we fitted a continuum to the 10@xmath2 m region of the spectra and computed the optical depth ( fig  [ 10mu_absorption ] ) . in both cases",
    "the peak of the absorption is slightly shifted towards shorter wavelengths indicating a non - ism like dust composition .",
    "additional absorption ( rno 1c ) or possibly additional dust emission on top of the absorption feature ( rno 1b ) is seen at longer wavelengths . at 15.2@xmath2 m",
    "co@xmath3 ice is creating a prominent absorption band and at @xmath2418@xmath2 m additional silicate absorption seems to be present .",
    "all these features indicate the existence of a dense dusty and icy environment in which the two fuors are embedded . a further analysis of these features also for a larger sample of fuors will be presented in an upcoming paper ( quanz et al . in preparation ) .",
    "in addition to the ice and silicate features , h@xmath3 emission lines from purely rotational quadrupole transitions are present in both spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . while in the spectrum close to rno 1b all transitions from s(1 ) to s(7 ) can be identified , the spectrum close to rno 1c shows only the lines from s(1 ) to s(5 ) .",
    "this can be explained with the higher continuum flux close to the s(6 ) and s(7 ) line in the latter spectrum and with apparently lower excitation temperatures ( see below ) .",
    "the lowest transition s(0 ) near 28.22@xmath2 m is not detected in either spectrum .",
    "this is due to the strongly rising continuum at longer wavelengths .",
    "here , the spectral slit contained flux from both rno objects and also from the deeply embedded iras source so that the continuum emission and the related flux errors completely dominate a possible weak emission line .",
    "a detailed analysis is provided in the appendix .    keeping in mind the existence of a molecular outflow that is powered by",
    "iras 00338 + 6312 and directly oriented in the direction of rno 1c and rno 1b ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the detection of h@xmath3 emission lines in both spectra hints towards shock induced emission related to the outflow .",
    "the spectra consequently bear information about the circumstellar material close to rno 1b/1c and about the outflow coming from the iras source .",
    "since we observe h@xmath3 lines even in the 10@xmath2 m silicate absorption bands the outflow appears to lie in front of the dusty environment as otherwise the high extinction ( a@xmath26 mag and a@xmath27 mag for rno 1b and rno1c , respectively , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would have prevented a detection .",
    "the measurement of the relative strengths of multiple h@xmath3 lines allows an analysis of the physical conditions of the shocked material . for this",
    "we assume local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) and optically thin line emission which is supported by the low einstein coefficients of the involved quadrupole transitions ( table  [ hydrogen_lines ] ) .",
    "following @xcite the column density of an upper energy level @xmath28 is then given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the observed line intensity in erg s@xmath11 @xmath31 sr@xmath11 , @xmath32 is the energy difference of the two states involved in the transition , @xmath33 is the einstein coefficient for the transition and @xmath34 is the optical depth at the observed wavelength . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show gaussian fits to the observed emission lines in the spectrum close to rno 1b and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] presents corresponding fits to the lines detected close rno 1c . before fitting the emission lines we subtracted the underlying continuum which was fitted with a second order polynomial",
    "the finally derived integrated line fluxes and column densities are shown in table  [ hydrogen_lines ] .",
    "we corrected the line fluxes for extinction effects using the results of @xcite and assuming @xmath35 mag .",
    "this value represents the extinction found by @xcite towards the nearby star rno 1 and should be a better estimate for the line - of - sight extinction than the above mentioned extinction values towards rno 1b and rno 1c . in any case",
    "the influence of the extinction on the derived shock temperatures and column densities ( see below ) is negligible .",
    "the 1sigma errors in the line flux , the line intensity and the column density ( table  [ hydrogen_lines ] ) were derived from generating 500 spectra where we added a gaussian noise to each measured flux point based on the initial individual 1sigma uncertainty . from these spectra",
    "we computed the mean values and related errors of the listed parameters . especially at the short wavelength end",
    "it shows that not all lines were detected with a 3sigma confidence level .",
    "however , since most lines were convincingly measured we decided to keep also the tentative detections in our analyses .",
    "since we assume lte the rotational energy levels shall be populated following boltzmann statistics with a unique temperature for several lines .",
    "the involved temperatures @xmath36 of the shocked material can be derived from a so  called `` rotational diagram '' . by using the results from eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , plotting the logarithm of @xmath37 against @xmath38 ( i.e. the formal temperature corresponding to the absolute upper energy level of the respective rotational transition ) and fitting a straight line to the data one finds that the slope of the straight line is proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "here , @xmath40 denotes the spin degeneracy of each energy level ( 1 for even j , 3 for odd j ) and @xmath41 is the rotational degeneracy .",
    "these numbers assume that the ortho  to  para ratio of the involved hydrogen is close to its lte value of 3 at @xmath36 .",
    "a deviation from this lte assumption ( i.e. , ortho  to  para @xmath42 3 ) would result in a downwards displacement of the data points with an odd j - number ( ortho  h@xmath3 ) relative to the points with even j - numbers ( para  h@xmath3 ) and thus create a `` zig  zag '' pattern in the rotational plot ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ,  [ fig7 ] , and  [ fig8 ] we show rotational plots for the measured lines near rno 1b and rno 1c . in all plots",
    "the errors for the data points denote the 1sigma uncertainty in the measured column density .    the rotational diagram of rno 1b in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows a clear curvature in the data points .",
    "this departure from a single straight line is indicative of several temperature components in the shocked material .",
    "we thus fitted the data with two superimposed temperature regimes ( hot and warm ) that rather represent the minimum and maximum of the involved temperatures than any distinct intermediate value .",
    "the dash - dotted line fits the high energy regime and represents the hot component with a temperature of 2991@xmath43596 k. the dotted line corresponds to a temperature of 1071@xmath43121 k designating the warm component .",
    "the uncertainties in the temperature denote the 1sigma confidence level of the fits .",
    "as the derived temperature is extremely sensitive to the slope of the fitted straight line the corresponding errors are rather large .",
    "in addition to the temperatures one can also derive the total h@xmath3 column density of the observed shock within the given aperture . from the y - intersects of the fits we estimate the hot component to have @xmath44(h@xmath3)@xmath45 and for the warm component we find @xmath46(h@xmath3)@xmath47 .    for the column densities derived from the spectrum close to rno 1c we plotted two rotational diagrams shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] and  [ fig8 ] .",
    "first , we fitted the data with a single temperature component of 1754@xmath43321 k. however , the shocked material is apparently not in lte as the data points with odd and even j - numbers are difficult to fit simultaneously with a straight line or a curve .",
    "as mentioned above this displacement is indicative of a departure from the lte ortho  to  para ratio of 3 .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the same data if one assumes an ortho  to  para ratio of 1 .",
    "now , a two component fit , similar to that in fig .  [ fig6 ] , is possible .",
    "for the hot component we derive a temperature of 2339@xmath43468 k , while the warm component is significantly colder with 466@xmath43264 k. the total h@xmath3 column densities amount to @xmath48(h@xmath3)@xmath49 and @xmath50(h@xmath3)@xmath51 , respectively .",
    "table  [ components ] summarizes the temperatures and total column densities of the different components for both spectra .",
    "the _ irac _ images reveal for the first time the embedded mir point source associated with iras 00338 + 6312 .",
    "however , already @xcite concluded from polarimetric observations that an additional source should be present close to the iras point source position .",
    "furthermore , many authors analyzing the bipolar outflow related to this region concluded that a deeply embedded object was most likely the driving source @xcite instead of one of the rno objects @xcite .",
    "previous ground based mir observations @xcite were possibly not sensitive enough to detect iras 00338 + 6312 .",
    "the observed properties of iras 00338 + 6312 convincingly classify the object as a young protostar and support the idea that it is indeed driving the molecular outflow . from their co measurements",
    "@xcite derived a total mass for this bipolar outflow of 1.4 m@xmath52 , indicating that iras 00338 + 6312 is an intermediate  mass protostar .",
    "the detection of the iras source solves also the problem that up to now the seds of rno 1b and rno 1c were unusually steep longward of 25@xmath2 m for fuor objects @xcite .",
    "the images presented here have sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution to show that the newly revealed source associated with iras 00338 + 6312 is most probably responsible for this flux excess .",
    "in addition to the iras object @xcite also suspected another embedded source which we identify with rno 1 g .",
    "furthermore , the detection of rno 1f @xcite , which was initially assumed to be a density enhancement rather than an independent self - luminous source @xcite , is confirmed with our _ irac _ images . only rno 1d , which was thought to be located between rno 1b and rno 1c @xcite , does not show up in our images .",
    "this source was , however , also not detected by @xcite and only tentatively seen in the data from @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether all detected objects are physically confined to the rno 1b/1c region .",
    "especially the membership of the newly discovered objects rno1 irac1 , rno1 irac2 , and rno1 irac3 needs to be confirmed .",
    "however , the _ irac _ observations suggest that rno 1b and rno 1c belong to a small cluster of ( partly very ) young objects . to our knowledge , although some fuors are known or suspected to be in binary or multiple systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the existence of fuors in a cluster - like environment is a so far unique finding . only the fuor candidate v1184 tau ( cb34 ) belongs also to a small cluster @xcite but its classification as fuor is far less certain than for the rno objects @xcite . in any case",
    "the still deeply embedded protostars in the close vicinity of rno 1b/1c put strong constraints on the age of the objects if one assumes coeval evolution .",
    "the magnitudes we derive for the two fuor objects at 3.6@xmath2 m can be compared to previous ground based measurements at 3.8@xmath2 m by @xcite and @xcite",
    ". however , one certainly has to keep in mind that the _ irac _ filter is not only different in terms of central wavelength but also the spectral width differs from that of the ground based instruments . while @xcite found @xmath53mag and @xmath54mag for rno 1b and rno 1c , respectively , @xcite observed rno 1c to be slightly brighter than rno 1b ( @xmath55mag vs. @xmath56mag ) .",
    "also in our measurements rno 1c seems to be the brighter component .",
    "however , both objects appear to be fainter in our observations compared to @xcite . apart from the differences in the filter properties intrinsic variations in the luminosity of the fuors and/or changing local extinction effects can account for the apparent variability in these objects .",
    "the detection of h@xmath3 rotational line emission can in general be attributed to collisional excitation from c- or j - type shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "c - type shocks are magnetic and less violent towards molecules in comparison to the mostly hydrodynamic j - type shocks that can dissociate h@xmath3 molecules even at lower shock velocities . from our rotational diagrams we derived shock temperatures that are similar to those found in the outflow from cepheus a @xcite . these authors could fit a two component c - shock model to their data and derived shock velocities between 25 and 30 kms@xmath11 for a cold and a hot component , respectively . by comparing our results directly to theoretical shock models",
    "we find that the c - shock model 1 from @xcite can explain both the hot and warm component in the spectrum close to rno 1b .",
    "considering our derived temperatures as an upper and lower limit for the shocked material , shock velocities between 15 and 30 kms@xmath11 are required .",
    "however , model 1 of @xcite predicts on ortho  to  para ratio of @xmath192 at the low velocity / low temperature limit which is not directly evident from our observations .",
    "more recent models by @xcite predict lower shock temperatures in c - type shocks for the same shock velocities in comparison to @xcite .",
    "following their models , our hot component in fig.[fig6 ] requires velocities exceeding 40 kms@xmath11 .",
    "slightly slower velocities ( @xmath1935 kms@xmath11 ) are already needed to explain the hot temperature component in the shock close to rno 1c ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . the warm component in this diagram represents shock velocities between 15 kms@xmath11 and 20 kms@xmath11 .",
    "although it is clear that some uncertainties between the observations and theory still remain , c - type shocks seem to provide a solid explanation for the observed shock temperatures .    the measurement of an ortho  to  para ratio smaller than 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] implies that despite the high temperatures the gas has not yet reached equilibrium between the ortho and para states .",
    "thus , the observed ratio is the legacy of the temperature history of the gas ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and transient heating by a recently passing shock wave already caused higher temperatures .",
    "as the corresponding region on the sky lies closer to the iras source than the region probed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the observations suggest that we see the signatures of at least two shock waves : the first shock wave is probed close to rno 1b ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) where we observe several temperature components that have apparently reached their equilibrium state .",
    "a more recent shock wave is seen close to rno 1c ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) where the ratio of the line column densities hints also towards high shock velocities and temperatures but the gas is not yet in thermal equilibrium .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * we detected and resolve for the first time the mir point source associated with iras 00338 + 6312 which appears to be an embedded intermediate ",
    "mass protostar driving the known molecular outflow in the rno 1b/1c region . *",
    "the detection of additional ( partly previously unknown ) point sources suggests that the fuor objects rno 1b/1c belong to a young small stellar cluster . to our knowledge ,",
    "rno 1b/1c are the only well  studied and confirmed fuors that apparently belong to a cluster  like environment . * all but",
    "two objects were detected in all four _ irac _ bands and their colors are consistent with class 0/i - ii objects .",
    "the two objects that were not detected at 3.6@xmath2 m ( including iras 00338 + 6312 ) are still very deeply embedded protostars .",
    "* having apparently extremely young objects in the direct vicinity of the fuors confirms the suspected young age for this type of objects although their mir colors are consistent with class ii objects .",
    "* the two mir spectra of the region bear clear signs of a dense icy and dusty circumstellar environment as solid state features are seen in absorption . *",
    "the spectra show also h@xmath3 emission lines from purely rotational transitions .",
    "we presume that these lines arise from shocked material within the molecular outflow .",

    "while the images give insights into the photometric properties of several young embedded objects and also fu orionis type stars the spectra provide information on the dusty and icy circumstellar environment of the young cluster as well as on shocked gas within a molecular outflow . in this context",
    "the existence of fuors in a cluster  like environment needs to be pointed out .",
    "it is still debated whether all young low  mass stars undergo an fuor phase or whether these objects form a special sub  group of ysos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our results suggests that the fuor phenomenon occurs also in young ( small ) stellar clusters making it thus possibly more common than so far expected .",
    "in addition , the co  existence of fuors and very young protostars in the same environment strengthens the idea that the fuor  phase of ysos is linked to the early stages of the star formation process .",
    "possible future investigations of the rno 1b/1c region should address whether the observed objects do indeed belong to the same region and whether all of them are young stars .",
    "furthermore , a detailed study of the shocked material including high  resolution narrow band imaging and spectroscopic mapping ( e.g. , with _ spitzer irs _ ) will provide deeper insights into its extension , physical conditions , and its relation to the molecular outflow .",
