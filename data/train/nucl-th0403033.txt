    "<S> we present an analysis of the net - baryon number rapidity distribution and of direct photon emission in the framework of the parton cascade model .    </S>",
    "<S> collisions of heavy nuclei at relativistic energies are expected to lead to the formation of a deconfined phase of strongly interacting nuclear matter , often referred to as a quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) . </S>",
    "<S> evidences for several of the signatures for the formation of this novel state of matter have recently been reported by experiments conducted at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many aspects of the experimental data indicate that an equilibrated state of hot and dense matter is formed in the collisions of au nuclei at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has not yet been well established how quickly this thermalized state is formed and which mechanisms are responsible for the rapid equilibration . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus of particular interest to identify processes that can give information about the pre - equilibrium dynamics in these collisions . in our contribution </S>",
    "<S> we focus on two such probes of the early phase at rhic : direct photons and the distribution of net baryon number .    </S>",
    "<S> the parton cascade model  @xcite ( pcm ) provides a suitable framework for the study of the formation of a hot and dense partonic phase , starting from clouds of valence quarks , sea quarks , and gluons which populate the nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the pcm was devised as a description of the early , pre - equilibrium phase of a nucleus - nucleus collision at high energy . </S>",
    "<S> the current implementation  @xcite does not include a description of the hadronization of the partonic matter and of the subsequent scattering among hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> these late - stage processes , however , are not expected to significantly alter the distribution of net baryon number with respect to rapidity , since the net baryon number is locally conserved and baryon diffusion in a hadronic gas can be shown to be slow @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the pcm assumes that the state of the dense partonic system can be characterized by a set of one - body distribution functions @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the flavor index ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 are coordinates in the eight - dimensional phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the partons are assumed to be on their mass shell , except before their first interaction . in our numerical implementation </S>",
    "<S> , the grv - ho parametrization @xcite is used , and the parton distribution functions are sampled at an initialization scale @xmath4 to create a discrete set of particles . </S>",
    "<S> partons generally propagate on - shell and along straight - line trajectories between interactions . before their first collision , </S>",
    "<S> all partons move with the beam ( target ) rapidity and do not have an `` intrinsic '' transverse momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> the time - evolution of the parton distribution is governed by a relativistic boltzmann equation : @xmath5 \\label{eq03}\\ ] ] where the collision term @xmath6 is a nonlinear functional of the phase - space distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations discussed below include all lowest - order qcd scattering processes between massless quarks and gluons . </S>",
    "<S> a low momentum transfer cut - off @xmath7 is needed to regularize the infrared divergence of the perturbative parton - parton cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we include the branchings @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the soft and collinear singularities in the showers are avoided by terminating the branchings when the virtuality of the time - like partons drops below @xmath12 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the results to be discussed below have been obtained using the vni / bms  @xcite implementation of the pcm .    </S>",
    "<S> the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] shows the pcm prediction for the net baryon rapidity distributions for @xmath13  gev . </S>",
    "<S> solid circles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] denote a calculation in which the pcm has been restricted to primary - primary parton scatterings , and therefore reflects a calculation in which each parton is allowed to scatter only once . </S>",
    "<S> already one hard collision is sufficient to deposit a net surplus of quarks into the mid - rapidity region , resulting in a net baryon density at @xmath14 5.0 at 200  gev . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the net baryon number distribution for each colliding nucleus , scaled by a factor 0.4 from the distribution shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , is shown as a dotted line . </S>",
    "<S> this initial state rapidity distribution can be calculated from the parton structure functions by relating the longitudinal momentum of the partons @xmath15 to the rapidity variable @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the rapidity of the fast moving nucleon , @xmath18 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath19 denotes the typical transverse momentum scale .    </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable similarity between the scaled initial state rapidity distribution and the pcm calculation involving primary - primary scattering demonstrates that the net baryon number distribution produced by first parton - parton collisions is predetermined by the initial parton structure of the nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the factor 0.4 is the average `` liberation factor '' @xmath20 for partons in the pcm for the selected parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the squares represent a calculation with full parton - parton rescattering . </S>",
    "<S> allowing for multiple parton collisions increases the net baryon density at mid - rapidity roughly by 75% , filling up the dip around mid - rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> this trend continues when parton fragmentation is included ( diamonds ) : the net baryon density increases to nearly 17 . </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity change of a quark in each subsequent collision after its liberation in the first hard scattering yields an average rapidity shift of roughly 0.65 units per collision . </S>",
    "<S> the band around mid - rapidity denotes the range of experimental estimates for the net - baryon density at mid - rapidity @xcite .    the right frame of figure  [ fig1 ] </S>",
    "<S> shows the net baryon density at mid - rapidity as a function of the momentum cut - off @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed power law dependence of the net baryon density as a function of @xmath22 stems from the properties of the pqcd cross sections in the pcm . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a saturation at small values of @xmath22 indicates that not all valence quarks are `` liberated '' in the range of cut - off values considered here . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find that the liberation factor for quarks in the nuclear parton distributions varies from about 0.7 for @xmath23 to about 0.2 for @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> overall we find that the valence quark distribution in the nucleon , combined with these multiple scattering effects , can explain the net baryon excess observed in au+au collisions at rhic in the central rapidity region @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2 ] shows the photon production processes included in the pcm ( left ) as well as the transverse momentum distribution ( right ) of direct photons calculated in the pcm . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve gives a pqcd prediction for prompt photon production , due to compton and annihilation processes . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the pcm implementation is confirmed by the quantitative agreement between this calculation and our results ( shown as circles ) , when an eikonal approximation is used to treat all the collisions in the cascade . </S>",
    "<S> we note that a substantial enhancement of the high energy photons is caused by the multiple scattering of partons ( triangles ) . </S>",
    "<S> fragmentation processes lead to an even stronger enhancement in the production of photons . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , there is production of photons from the fragmentation off the scattered quarks . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , and more importantly , the fragmentation leads to a rapid multiplication of partons and enhanced multiple scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting calculation is denoted by the diamonds in figure  [ fig2 ] . in summary , we find that multiple scattering of partons leads to a substantial production of high energy photons , which rises further when parton multiplication due to final state radiation is included @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the photon yield is found to scale as @xmath25 and is directly proportional to the number of hard parton - parton collisions in the system , providing valuable information on the pre - equilibrium reaction dynamics of the system .    </S>",
