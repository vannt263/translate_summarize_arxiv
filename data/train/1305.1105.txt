    "a great number of supernovae ( sne ) have been observed and new ones are being discovered owing to ongoing transient surveys and monitorings . despite the large , growing number of observed events the real nature of the progenitor of each type of supernova is still not very well understood .",
    "recently , a number of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) have had their progenitor star detected in high resolution pre - explosion images ( e.g. @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the detection of the progenitor in several passbands allows the comparison between observed colors and luminosity of the star with stellar models .",
    "while direct detection is obviously desirable , in most cases only upper luminosity limits could be derived due to non - detection .",
    "this , however , is still useful in constraining the progenitor properties .",
    "comparison with theoretical models yields the evolutionary stage and position in the hertzprung - russel diagram of the star , from which the initial mass could ultimately be derived . using this method",
    "@xcite concludes that sne ii - p arise from red supergiant stars with initial mass between @xmath2 and @xmath3  m@xmath1 .",
    "while the progenitors of sne ii - p have been convincingly detected and characterized , currently no ib / c progenitor has been detected .",
    "it is widely believed that since sne ib / c are deficient in hydrogen and helium , the most likely candidate for their progenitors would naturally be the wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars @xcite .",
    "numerous stellar evolution models have been proposed to characterize the progenitor stars of different sn types ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but these predictions are still not very well tested with observational data .",
    "progenitor discoveries could provide useful comparisons but the number of data points is still too small and not very reliable , considering a number of uncertainties such as metallicity assumption and also the sensitivity of the method to errors in luminosity ( determined using host galaxy distance ) and the end state of the evolution of the exploding star .",
    "furthermore , progenitor discoveries ideally should be followed - up by post - explosion observation to ensure that the purported progenitor has indeed gone .",
    "however , this has not been done for the majority of the progenitors thus future confirmation of their disappearance is still needed .",
    "initial mass of a progenitor star is generally considered as the most influential parameter driving the evolution of the star .",
    "hydrogen - deficient ( type - ib , ic ) sne require progenitors with high mass - loss rate to remove the outer hydrogen envelope of the star , in which metallicity - driven wind ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or other mechanism could play a significant role . therefore , it is also important to investigate the metallicity of the progenitor star in addition to the initial mass",
    ". this dependence on metallicity affects the number ratio @xmath4 as suggested by several previous studies @xcite .",
    "another possible mechanism of mass loss is via close binary interaction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "extending the work of @xcite for sn ib / c progenitors , @xcite suggest that the non - detection of sn ib / c progenitors may be explained by the idea that probably most of sn ib / c progenitors arise from interacting binaries with mass @xmath5 m@xmath1 .",
    "an example where binary scenario provides a good alternative explanation to the massive single star progenitor is given by @xcite in the case of sn ic 2002ap . from analysis of pre - explosion images",
    ", they suggest that the progenitor of sn 2002ap was probably initially a 3040 m@xmath1 star with twice the standard mass - loss rate , or in a binary system as a 1520 m@xmath1 star .",
    "@xcite showed that sne ib / c occur in higher metallicity environments than sne ii .",
    "high metallicity massive stars tend to explode as sne ib / c , thus higher number ratio @xmath4 is expected in higher - metallicity environment . while @xcite suggest that sn ib and ic have similar metallicities , @xcite argue that sn ic have higher metallicity than ib .",
    "the results of @xcite , and recently @xcite , also show indications for higher metallicity for ic , but those were not statistically significant .",
    "in contrast with this work , all those previous studies mentioned above used slit spectroscopy to obtain spectra of the sn explosion sites , from which the site metallicities were derived .    considering the limitations of finding sn progenitors in high - quality pre - explosion images ,",
    "several alternative methods have been devised to obtain insights into the nature and possible mass range of the progenitors .",
    "a statistical study by @xcite using correlations of sn positions within host galaxies with h@xmath6 emission showed that the association of sne with recent star formation follows a sn ic @xmath7 ib @xmath7 ii sequence , indicating a grouping of decreasing progenitor mass .",
    "this result is further reinforced in @xcite ; but see @xcite for a discussion on how sn association with a nearby h`ii ` only constrains the progenitor mass weakly .",
    "@xcite suggest that sn ib / c progenitors are more massive than 2530  m@xmath1 from the age of the youngest stellar population at the explosion site , estimated using h@xmath6 emission line equivalent width .",
    "however , in that case it is likely that multiple stellar populations have been observed and treated as a single one since the study used integrated light over a large region within the spectrograph slit , in some cases @xmath8 kpc .",
    "some of their targets are also not the exact explosion sites but other regions several kpc away in the host galaxy .",
    "therefore , consequently the real parent population might has been contaminated by other populations of possibly different ages and metallicities .",
    "this problem is also present in similar studies such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we endeavour to refine the results of those efforts by resolved spectroscopy of the explosion site , with typical spatial resolution of around 70 pc ( 1 \" at 15 mpc ) .",
    "a similar approach has been employed by @xcite to estimate the initial mass of the progenitor of the optical transient ngc 300 ot2008 - 1 .",
    "they probed region @xmath950 pc around the transient , and determined the initial progenitor mass of 1225 m@xmath1 from the analysis of the stellar population at the site .",
    "in this paper we report the results of our study of 11 nearby ib / c sn explosion sites , in which the parent stellar populations were detected and used to derive progenitor stars mass and metallicity .",
    "we will use the terms star cluster , h`ii ` region , and ob association interchangeably in this paper to refer to the stellar population .",
    "as stars are born in clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite who suggest that this depends on the adopted cluster definition , which may change the fraction of stars born in clusters to be @xmath1090% ) and there is evidence that all massive stars may be born within clustered environments @xcite , it is reasonable to derive a coeval stars age and metallicity from its parent stellar population .",
    "it is not expected that the progenitor star would have wandered far from the birthplace cluster since they would not have much time to travel before exploding as a supernova  thus the parent cluster may be studied to extract useful information on the coeval sn progenitor star .",
    "typical velocity dispersion inside a star cluster is a few km / s @xcite , which corresponds to about a few pc / myr .",
    "therefore a sn progenitor which belongs to such cluster , if unbound , would only travel typically a few tens of parsec during its several myr lifetime . by studying the host cluster",
    "we were able to derive initial mass and metallicity of the sn progenitors .",
    "we organize the paper as follows .",
    "observation , data reductions , and the subsequent analysis is presented in section [ data ] .",
    "descriptions of each sn explosion sites are given in section [ sites ] .",
    "we discuss our findings in section [ discu ] and finally a summary is presented in section [ summ ] .",
    "we selected our samples from the asiago supernova database @xcite .",
    "sne in host galaxies with radial velocity of 3000 km / s or less were selected and subsequently careful visual inspections were performed to dss and sdss images of the explosion sites using aladin .",
    "we use equatorial coordinates from the asiago database to locate the sn positions in the images .",
    "in addition , we also used the published images of the sn environment / light echo study by @xcite to compare with and identify some sn host clusters .",
    "sn classification follows the asiago database classification ; in this paper we present the study of our sne ib / c samples while the type - ii sne are presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) .",
    "sne showing close association with a bright knot were selected as observation targets .",
    "we interpret these knots as the parent stellar population of the sn progenitor star .",
    "the utilization of broadband images ensure that there is no selection preference towards very young stellar populations , as opposed to if we carried out our selection using h@xmath6 or uv images .",
    "therefore , we expect very little age bias to be present in our sample explosion site .",
    "we observed 7 of our targets in 2010 - 2011 using the supernova integral field spectrograph ( snifs ; @xcite , @xcite ) mounted at university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope ( uh88 ) at mauna kea .",
    "table [ tabobs ] contains the observations of our sn site targets .",
    "the positional uncertainty of each sn is also showed ; the reasons for each estimates are given in the description of each explosion sites .",
    "the integral field spectrograph snifs employs a fully - filled @xmath11 lenslet array in the integral field unit ( ifu ) , covering 6.4``@xmath126.4 '' wide field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the corresponding spatial resolution is 0.43 arcsec per spatial pixel ( spaxel ) .",
    "snifs has a photometric channel that is used to accurately place objects in the ifu .",
    "the positional accuracy with which a given ( ra , dec ) coordinates is placed on the ifu is around 0.2 arcsec . the scale and rotation of the snifs ifu",
    "is well measured thus should not produce much additional astrometric uncertainty .",
    "the spectrograph consists of two arms operating simultaneously to cover the whole optical wavelength range at @xmath13 : the blue channel covers 3300  5200 @xmath14 and the red channel covers 5100  9700  .",
    "snifs is operated remotely with a fully - dedicated data reduction pipeline .",
    "the final pipeline result is wavelength- and flux - calibrated ( @xmath15 ) datacubes .",
    "the description of the pipeline is similar to what is presented in  4 of @xcite and is outlined briefly in @xcite .",
    "observation of the other 4 targets was carried out using the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) in ifu mode @xcite , with the 8.1 m gemini north telescope at mauna kea ( program i d gn-2011b - c-6 , via subaru ",
    "gemini time exchange program ) .",
    "gmos was used in one - slit mode , providing a 5 `` @xmath12 3.5 '' field of view sampled by the hexagonal lenslet array with one lenslet diameter of 0.2 \" .",
    "we used the b600 grating centered at 5400  , and also took identical exposures with the grating centered at 5450 @xmath14 in order to perform spectral dithering to eliminate cosmic rays and cover the gaps of the three ccds utilized by gmos .",
    "this enables us to observe continuous spectra from 4000 @xmath14 to 6800 @xmath14 at @xmath16 , thus covering and resolving prominent spectral lines such as h@xmath6 , h@xmath17 , h@xmath18 , h@xmath19 , [ o`iii`]@xmath204959,5007 , [ n`ii`]@xmath206548,6583 , and [ s`ii`]@xmath206716,6731 .",
    "subsequent data reduction was carried out using the gemini package in iraf .",
    "the data was reduced to remove instrumental signatures and then calibrated in wavelength and flux to produce final ( @xmath15 ) datacubes .",
    "once the raw snifs and gmos data have been fully reduced into ( @xmath15 ) datacubes , object spectrum extraction and analysis were done using iraf .",
    "the datacubes were treated as stacks of images taken at different wavelengths .",
    "the flux density of an object at each wavelength slice was extracted by performing aperture photometry ( iraf/_apphot _ ) on the object at each slice , and arranging the values in the wavelength direction to produce a spectrum .",
    "the seeing fwhm was used as the radius of the circular aperture , or in some cases smaller apertures were used due to object proximity to the edge of the field of view .",
    "sky in snifs data was estimated using an annular aperture around the object and subtracted out .",
    "usually the annulus is larger than the field width thus effectively only a part of it was being used to measure the sky .",
    "gmos is equipped by another ifu dedicated for simultaneous sky observation during the science exposures , and subtraction was done in the reduction process .",
    "the positions of the objects in each snifs wavelength slice were traced , thus compensating the differential atmospheric refraction effect ( dar ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this demonstrates the advantage of using integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) compared to conventional slit spectroscopy which is strongly affected by dar , and with ifs the effects of dar could be corrected _ a posteriori _ as has been shown by @xcite .",
    "the gmos dataset was corrected for dar in the datacube stage by shifting each wavelength slices , and aperture photometry of individual slices was done with fixed aperture position for each object .",
    "the final resulting spectra were then analysed using iraf/_splot_. nebular emission lines were measured by fitting a gaussian profile . to measure metallicity ,",
    "only the nebular emission lines are needed thus the stellar continuum was removed prior to line measurement by fitting a polynomial function . before measuring line equivalent width ,",
    "the continuum was normalized also by fitting with a polynomial .",
    "metallicity in terms of oxygen abundance was derived using the o3n2 and n2 calibrations by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pp04 ) .",
    "this method of metallicity determination uses intensity ratios of lines closely spaced in wavelength , therefore not sensitive against errors introduced by reddening and flux calibration .",
    "following pp04 , we adopt 12 + log ( o / h ) = 8.66 as the value of the solar oxygen abundance @xcite . in all of the observed fields h@xmath6 and [",
    "nii]@xmath216583 were detected thus enabling n2 determination , while the h@xmath17 and [ oiii]@xmath215007 detection required for o3n2 is less frequent . in cases",
    "where both o3n2 and n2 were detected we adopt the mean value as the metallicity , otherwise the n2 value is adopted .",
    "the errors quoted in metallicity in z@xmath1 unit are the bounds for the highest and lowest values of 12+log(o / h ) determined from o3n2 and n2 . in cases where only n2 is available , we assign the error of 12+log(o / h ) as @xmath22 dex , which is the 1@xmath23 uncertainty in the pp04 s n2 calibration determination .",
    "these were then converted into z@xmath1 metallicities to give the highest and lowest value bounds of metallicity .",
    "ages of the stellar populations were determined by comparing the observed h@xmath6 equivalent width ( ew ) with the theoretical values provided by simple stellar population ( ssp ) model starburst99 @xcite for each appropriate metallicity .",
    "we assume an instantaneous - burst stellar population with continuous , standard salpeter imf ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the evolution of h@xmath6ew with ssp age is presented in figure  [ haew ] .",
    "h@xmath6ew of a stellar population with continuous star formation is also shown for comparison .",
    "the evolution of h@xmath6 is sensitive to the star formation history , while imf variations give less important effect especially at ssp age older than @xmath25 myr .",
    "the error of h@xmath6ew were estimated from the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectral continuum around h@xmath6 .",
    "we expect the effect of dust absorption in h@xmath6ew determination to be minimal due to the very small wavelength range used for ew measurement .",
    "the ssp age determined from h@xmath6ew is adopted as the lifetime of the coeval progenitor star , and comparison with padova stellar evolution models gives the estimated initial mass of a star with such lifetime .",
    "we used models from @xcite for solar metallicity ( z = 0.02 ) , and @xcite for 0.4 solar metallicity ( z = 0.008 ) .",
    "we defined observed oxygen abundance of 0.7 ( o / h)@xmath1 , corresponding to 12+log(o / h ) = 8.50 , as the dividing line between using the solar - metallicity model or the subsolar one to determine stellar initial mass .",
    "these models extend from the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) to the onset of central carbon burning .",
    "this is considered representative of the stellar lifetime since the time elapsed from carbon burning to sn is only about a few hundred years , negligible compared to the @xmath26 year lifetime of the star .",

    "the progenitor mass of sn ic averages @xmath179  m@xmath1 , while for sn ib the average progenitor mass is @xmath180  m@xmath1 .",
    "the high o3n2 metallicity of sn ic sites supports this conclusion that sn ic progenitors have mass within the wr star range .",
    "we note that the large deviation in sn ic average progenitor mass is caused by the very high determined mass of sn 1964l , @xmath181  m@xmath1 .",
    "if we omit this one sn the average progenitor mass for sn ic is reduced to @xmath182  m@xmath1  still higher than sn ib progenitor average and consistent with wr star mass .",
    "the statistical significance of the ib and ic progenitor mass difference is @xmath183 , and the inclusion of sn 1964l will slightly reduce it into @xmath184 .",
    "our results also show some examples where the progenitor may have originated from close binary systems , considering the old age of the parent stellar population .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite , which suggests that both single or binary progenitor scenarios are at work for sn ib / c production .",
    "recent finding by @xcite shows that binary interaction may affect 70% or more of the massive star population .",
    "considering the two channels of high and low mass progenitors possible for sn ib / c , it is interesting to compare it with the derived initial masses of the compact remnants in the galaxy .",
    "magnetars are believed to be formed by rapidly rotating massive stellar cores , and this mechanism would not work if the star enters the red supergiant phase where magnetic breaking between the stellar core and envelope may spin down the core rotation .",
    "therefore , a very high mass star ( @xmath175  m@xmath1 ) that can lose a significant portion of its hydrogen envelope prior to sn is required as the progenitor of magnetars .",
    "several studies have confirmed this by studying the host star clusters of the magnetars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but @xcite showed that the magnetar sgr 1900 + 14 may have had a low mass progenitor of around 17  m@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the sn that produced those magnetars should also came from both massive and lower - mass stars , and the sn needs to be a stripped - envelope event to be able to produce rapid core rotation that eventually gave birth to the magnetar . in context with sn ib / c progenitor initial mass derived from our study , the two results are in line .",
    "more samples of both ib / c sn and magnetar progenitors would be beneficial to establish a firm connection between the two .    we note that this study is based on the assumption that the sn progenitor had been a member of the apparent host star cluster present at the explosion site . while this assumption might not necessarily be true , we argue that it is more likely that the associated cluster is the real parent stellar population of the sn progenitor rather than the diffuse background stellar population .",
    "the host cluster has been revealed to have very young age , thus the imf implies higher probability of having high - mass stars compared to the background stellar population which is significantly older than the few myr age of the prominent cluster .",
    "we discuss the probability of contamination by older , invisible clusters in the field in paper ii , where the effect is more important for type ii sn progenitors , which are presumably older than sn ib / c progenitors .",
    "we also present our mass estimate if we only consider the high - association cases only , i.e. sne within 150 pc of the host cluster center .",
    "this 150 pc is about the intermediate size between classical and giant h`ii ` regions @xcite , as most of our clusters are apparently of around this size . with this limitation ,",
    "the mean progenitor mass of sne ic reduces to @xmath182  m@xmath1 , and sn ib progenitors to @xmath185  m@xmath1 .",
    "this would not change the aforementioned conclusion .",
    "we present the results of our investigation of nearby sne ib / c explosion sites using integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) technique , performed using uh88/snifs and gemini / gmos . taking advantage of ifs , we spatially identified star clusters at the explosion sites and extracted their respective spectra for the purpose of analysis . from the spectra we derived the metallicities of the clusters in terms of 12+log(o / h ) using the strong line method , and age using comparison of observed h@xmath6 emission equivalent width with theoretical ssp models from starburst99 .",
    "the method employed in this study offers the best available determination of sn progenitor natal metallicity , probing a very localized region specifically the parent stellar population from which the sn progenitor was born .",
    "this minimizes the effect of contamination from other populations and definitely is more reliable compared to metallicity determinations using proxies .",
    "as metallicity is one important parameter in context of sne ib / c progenitor studies , our result provides an important insight in this field .",
    "we found indication that the metallicity of sne ic explosion sites is on average higher than sne ib sites , by @xmath186 dex .",
    "this result is in accordance with @xcite and @xcite who also found indication that sn ic explosion sites are more metal - rich compared to sn ib sites , although not statistically significant , and @xcite who suggest the same conclusion with results they claim to be statistically significant .",
    "the age of the sn progenitor host cluster is considered as the lifetime of the progenitor star . comparing with padova stellar evolution models , we are able to derive initial mass of sne ib / c progenitors from the ages of their parent star cluster .",
    "we found that sne ic explosion sites have younger age than sne ib , indicating that they arise from higher mass progenitors than sne ib .",
    "the derived progenitor mass from host cluster age is significantly higher for sn ic , over 42  m@xmath1 versus 21  m@xmath1 for sn ib progenitors .",
    "we note that these derived average progenitor mass were derived from a sample that includes sub - wr mass progenitors ( @xmath187  m@xmath1 ) which may be interpreted as binary progenitors . if we consider the single progenitors only , sn ic progenitors average 47.9  m@xmath1 while sn ib progenitor mass average is 32.2  m@xmath1  still attesting that sn ic progenitors are the more massive ones .",
    "further , if only sne showing high association with the parent clusters are considered , the average progenitor mass estimates would reduce to 27.5 and 22.6 , for sne ic and ib respectively .",
    "in general , our findings support the current picture of stripped envelope ( ib / c ) sn progenitors : sne ic tend to have more massive progenitors and more metal - rich than sne ib , and for both sn types interacting massive binary stars may comprise a fraction of the progenitors of the sne .    we acknowledge the anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions . h.k .",
