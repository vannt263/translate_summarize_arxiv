    "for the first time , results on exclusive @xmath0 spin cross section asymmetries have been presented in this workshop .",
    "the experiment was carried out at cern by the spin muon collaboration ( smc ) .",
    "smc is a fixed target experiment using a 190 gev polarized muon beam impinging on polarized proton ( butanol or ammonia ) and deuteron ( deuterated butanol ) targets in the kinematic range 0.0008  @xmath7  x  @xmath7  0.7 , 0.01  gev@xmath6  @xmath12  60  gev@xmath6 , and 140  @xmath7  w@xmath6  @xmath7  310  gev@xmath6 ( @xmath8  15  gev ) .",
    "a detailed description of the smc experiment is given in ref @xcite .",
    "only aspects particular to the exclusive @xmath0 production will be discussed .",
    "exclusive @xmath0 production is a process in which only a @xmath0 is produced and the nucleon recoils elastically : @xmath13   @xmath2 . in smc the kinematics is entirely determined by the scattered muon , which is precisely reconstructed even at low @xmath3 , and the @xmath0 via its decay into @xmath14  and  @xmath15 . although the nucleon is undetected , the kinematics of the scattered muon and of the @xmath0 are sufficient to select the elastic process @xcite .",
    "such a measurement will add more insight into the @xmath0 production mechanism , as well as into its spin dependence .",
    "it will also allow to study the spin properties of the hadronic photon at very low @xmath3 .",
    "given the high energy of the smc muon beam , the spin cross section asymmetries are measured in the @xmath16 region of @xmath17  15 gev , where at low @xmath3 unpolarized data are interpreted in terms of a _ soft _ pomeron exchange  @xcite .",
    "good _ dis events are selected based on the scattered muon kinematics : * @xmath18 0.01 gev@xmath6 * , * @xmath19 0.4 * and * @xmath20 0.9 * , * scattered muon momentum @xmath21 19 gev*. second , the vector mesons are identified via their decay into @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in order to obtain an elastic @xmath0 sample ,",
    "events have been selected requiring : + a ) * only two hadron tracks of opposite charge * associated with the vertex defined by the incident and scattered muon tracks . to each track",
    "the pion mass has been assigned , since there was no hadron identification .",
    "electron pairs from bremsstrahlung photons have been removed using the smc calorimeter @xcite , and events with the invariant mass @xmath22 in the range of the @xmath23 meson have been excluded .",
    "+ b ) to isolate an elastic process , events in the inelasticity , i , interval * @xmath240.05",
    "@xmath7  i  @xmath7  0.05 * , where i  @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the missing mass squared of the undetected recoiling system ) , have been selected .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] shows the inelasticity distribution .",
    "the peak around zero contains the elastic events above a very small background .",
    "other experiments cut on @xmath27 @xmath28 i @xmath29 for large @xmath30 . in smc",
    "the width of the @xmath31 distribution is about @xmath32 , and the i interval corresponds to @xmath24  0.5  @xmath7  @xmath33  @xmath7  0.5  gev .",
    "the i cut has been chosen because it does not depend on @xmath34 ; + c ) finally a cut on the invariant mass has been applied : * 0.62  @xmath7  @xmath9  @xmath7  1.07 *  gev@xmath10 .    figure  [ figure2 ] shows the invariant mass spectrum of the selected data sample with a clear @xmath0 peak .",
    "this @xmath0 invariant mass distribution is well described by different models . in figure  [ figure2 ]",
    "a fit to the distribution is performed according to the sding model @xcite .",
    "the final @xmath0 sample consists of @xmath17  52  k  @xmath0 s produced on polarized protons and @xmath17  43  k  @xmath0 s on polarized deuterons . for @xmath35  gev@xmath36 , @xmath17  17  k  @xmath0 s on protons and @xmath17  14  k  @xmath0 s on deuterons are left , where @xmath37 is the @xmath0 transverse momentum with respect to the virtual photon .",

    "the indices @xmath41 and @xmath42 refer to the relative orientation of the photon and proton ( or deuteron ) spins . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the target and beam polarizations , respectively , and @xmath45 is the dilution factor giving the fraction of polarized nucleons to the total nucleons in the target . in order to estimate @xmath46(@xmath3 , p@xmath47 ) , all available cross section measurements for elastic @xmath0 production on nuclei in our kinematic range were used .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ] shows the @xmath0 production spin asymmetries for the proton and the deuteron separately .",
    "the data have been divided in 5 @xmath3 bins in order to study the @xmath3 dependence . in figure  [ figure4 ]",
    "the same data are shown for @xmath48 gev@xmath36 . in both cases",
    "the data show no significant asymmetry neither for the proton nor for the deuteron .",
    "note that the spin asymmetry originates only from scattering on the polarized proton or deuteron , while the @xmath0 s produced from nuclei represent an unpolarized background , which is properly taken into account by the dilution factor .",
    "the @xmath0 lepton - nucleon production spin asymmetries have also been studied as a function of the @xmath49 polar angle of the decay @xmath14 in the @xmath0  c.m.s . for @xmath50 0.5 ( @xmath51 0.5 )",
    "the @xmath0 s are mainly transversely ( longitudinally ) polarized .",
    "figure  [ figure5 ] shows @xmath52 as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath51  0.5 and @xmath50  0.5 ( proton and deuteron combined ) .    as a check of systematic effects ,",
    "the false asymmetries , which by construction should give zero , have been computed .",
    "they have been found to be zero .",
    "the contribution of radiative events has been estimated to be less than 2  % for the smc kinematics .",
    "the main sources of systematic errors are + 1 ) the non - elastic background below the inelasticity peak : it is less than 5  % at low @xmath3 , and slightly higher ( less than 10  % ) at high @xmath3 ; + 2 ) the uncertainty on the dilution factor coming from the poor knowledge of the a - dependence of the cross section @xmath53 giving @xmath54 0.15 .",
    "the smc collaboration at cern has presented for the first time preliminary results on exclusive spin cross section asymmetries of the @xmath0 mesons for @xmath55  0.01  gev@xmath6 and @xmath56  15  gev over a large @xmath57 range .",
    "the preliminary data , within the statistical accuracy of the measurement , show no significant spin asymmetries at low @xmath3 ( @xmath58 5  gev@xmath6 ) both for the whole @xmath4 range and @xmath48  gev@xmath36 , neither for the proton nor for the deuteron . in the last @xmath3 bin ( @xmath59 10  gev@xmath6 )",
    "an indication of a non - zero spin asymmetry is observed . combining proton and deuteron data ,",
