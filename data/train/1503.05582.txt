    "due to its large cross section and favorable wavelength range , the sodium doublet lines have been a boon to astronomers seeking to characterise exoplanetary atmospheres @xcite .",
    "in fact , the first detection of an exoplanetary atmosphere ( that of hd 209458b ) was accomplished via measuring the sodium doublet @xcite .",
    "ever since that discovery , sodium has been detected in several hot jupiters using both space- and ground - based transmission spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "as better instruments come online and our ability to resolve the sodium lines improves , it is worth revisiting and redeveloping a theory of how to interpret them . from a remote sensing perspective , a pair of fully resolved sodium lines can , in principle , map out the temperature - pressure profile of an atmosphere at high altitudes and yield the sodium abundance .",
    "a quantity used to interpret absorption lines is the equivalent width @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the optical depth of the intervening material and @xmath7 denotes the wavelength .",
    "the equivalent width is essentially the width of a box with the same depth as the trough of the absorption line , such that it encompasses the same area .    while it is not immediately obvious , @xmath8 and the transit radius ( @xmath9 ) are actually independent observables .",
    "a simple thought experiment demonstrates this . consider a fictitious star that emits achromatically . at the exact moment of transit",
    ", one may record an absorption spectrum of the exoplanetary atmosphere . if the wavelength coverage is sufficient , the sodium doublet and the continuum and thus @xmath8 may be measured .",
    "to record the transit radius requires temporal information : the change in flux in and out of transit . in short ,",
    "@xmath8 measures changes in absorption across wavelength , while @xmath9 derives from the change in flux across time .",
    "certainly , stars are not achromatic light sources and one needs to measure the stellar lines in and out of transit to properly subtract out their influence , but this is an observational , rather than a theoretical , obstacle .    )",
    "is the largest . in the line wings , where the cross section is the smallest ,",
    "the transit radius ( @xmath9 ) is correspondingly smaller .",
    "the cartoon on the right reproduces the schematic depicted in @xcite . ]    nevertheless ,",
    "a theoretical challenge with interpreting @xmath10 , for transmission spectra of exoplanets , is that the optical depth depends on the transit radius and the radius itself depends on wavelength ( figure [ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "it is generally difficult to derive the functional form of @xmath11 , but it is straightforward to measure it .",
    "additionally , while @xmath10 is associated with a fixed sightline in traditional studies of the interstellar medium , it is associated with a _ set of sightlines _ in transmission spectra , each corresponding to a different wavelength . instead of a theory for @xmath10",
    ", we develop one for @xmath12 .",
    "observationally , it takes the form , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the flux associated with the continuum and @xmath15 is the flux at any point within the line .",
    "more specifically , both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are integrated over a ( small ) wavelength interval @xmath16 that is chosen based on practical constraints",
    ". we shall term @xmath17 the _ absorption depth _ ( and leave @xmath8 nameless ) .",
    "since the line - center wavelength of both sodium lines is @xmath18 @xmath19 m , the line - center frequency is @xmath20 hz .",
    "this means that the doppler line width is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the speed of light , @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath24 is the temperature , @xmath25 is the mean molecular mass and @xmath26 is the mass of the hydrogen atom .",
    "we assume that sodium is a trace element in the atmosphere and that doppler broadening is mediated by a dominant buffer or inert gas ( i.e. , molecular hydrogen ) .",
    "by contrast , the natural line width is @xmath27 where @xmath28 s@xmath1 is the einstein a - coefficient .",
    "furthermore , the damping coefficient associated with the voigt profile is @xmath29 implying that the voigt and doppler profiles are essentially identical near line center .",
    "if pressure broadening is significant , then @xmath30 needs to be replaced by @xmath31 in the lorentz profile , where @xmath32 is the collisional frequency @xcite .",
    "pressure broadening is similar in nature to doppler broadening , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mean free path of collisions and @xmath35 @xmath36 is the cross section of collisions with hydrogen molecules .",
    "pressure broadening may be ignored if the pressure being sensed is approximately @xmath37 we will neglect pressure broadening for our analysis of the sodium lines , while being aware of a shortcoming of our theory : we can not directly diagnose the value of the _ total _ pressure being sensed , since it is degenerate with the sodium abundance .",
    "non - lorentzian corrections to the sodium line wings are only important far away ( @xmath38 ) from line center and for @xmath39 bar @xcite .     and 0.1 .",
    "the former value is representative of the sodium lines in hot exoplanetary atmospheres , while the latter value is presented as an extreme case .",
    "the line core is well approximated by a doppler profile out to several doppler widths . beyond this , the line wings are better approximated by a lorentz profile . from inspecting these profiles ,",
    "it is clear that the shape and normalization of the doppler core are insensitive to temperature , whereas the difference in normalization between it and the lorentzian wings serves as a temperature diagnostic . ]",
    "consider a point on one of the sodium lines that is separated by @xmath40 , in wavelength , from line center . in frequency , the separation is @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath42 , then we have @xmath43 implying that the lines are tens of doppler widths wide . even by moving 0.3    away from line center ,",
    "one is already well into the lorentzian wings of the profile . in the line wings ,",
    "we may approximate the line shape with a lorentz profile .",
    "collectively , the sodium line profile in hot exoplanetary atmospheres ( @xmath44 k ) is well - approximated by a doppler core and lorentzian wings ( figure [ fig : profiles ] ) , which allows us to circumvent the more challenging task of inverting a voigt profile .      in @xcite ,",
    "the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and an isothermal atmosphere led to an expression for the number density , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a reference value of the number density , @xmath47 is the height above some reference radius @xmath9 , @xmath48 is the pressure scale height and @xmath49 is the surface gravity . using pythagoras s theorem and assuming @xmath50 , @xcite obtained ( see figure [ fig : schematic ] for the geometry ) @xmath51 it follows that the optical depth of the chord associated with the transit radius is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the absorption cross section .",
    "in hindsight , one could have obtained a quick answer by writing @xmath54 and recognising that @xmath55 is roughly the geometric mean of two vastly different length scales , @xmath56 and @xmath9 .",
    "several properties associated with the formula of @xcite , restated in our equation ( [ eq : fortney ] ) , are worth emphasizing .",
    "first , it can only be applied to isothermal situations .",
    "second , @xmath9 is a _ wavelength - dependent _ quantity .",
    "third , since one is sensing different values of @xmath9 across wavelength , the value of @xmath46 sampled varies as well .",
    "the number density can be fixed by writing @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is its value in the line wings . unlike @xmath46",
    ", @xmath58 is a wavelength - independent quantity .",
    "the third line of reasoning allowed @xcite to invert the expression for @xmath6 and obtain @xmath59}.\\ ] ] since the transit radius always picks out @xmath60 by definition and @xmath24 is not a wavelength - dependent quantity , it follows that @xmath61^{-1}. \\label{eq : t_lec}\\ ] ] the second term within the square brackets is typically smaller than the first , i.e. , @xmath62 , since we expect the transit radius to vary by fractions of a percent , whereas the cross section is expected to vary by orders of magnitude .",
    "dropping the second term reproduces equation ( 2 ) of @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : t_lec ] ) is directly applicable to situations where @xmath63 is constant ( e.g. , rayleigh scattering ) , but is less amenable to analyzing spectral line shapes , where @xmath63 is non - constant by definition .      , @xmath64 cm s@xmath65 , @xmath66 cm , @xmath67 cm , @xmath68 and @xmath69 k km@xmath1 for illustration .",

    "for the remainder of the study , we shall deal only with the absorption depth as an observable .",

    "we have defined the diagnostic ratio as @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "the temperature is mostly controlled by the difference in transit radii between the line center and wings .",
    "formally , @xmath91 has a very weak dependence on @xmath24 , so equation ( [ eq : temp_isothermal ] ) is not an explicit formula for @xmath24 . in practice",
    ", one sets @xmath44 k , measures or assumes all of the other parameter values , uses equation ( [ eq : temp_isothermal ] ) to compute an updated value of @xmath24 and iterates .",
    "a converged answer should obtain within a few iterations .",
    "figure [ fig : diagnostics ] shows calculations of @xmath88 as a function of @xmath92 for both sodium lines . for the sodium d@xmath93 line , we have used @xmath94    and @xmath95 ; for the sodium d@xmath96 line , we have used @xmath97    and @xmath98 @xcite . the d@xmath93 and d@xmath96 lines are sensing different altitudes within the atmosphere .",
    "figure [ fig : diagnostics ] also shows the line - wing temperature as a function of the diagnostic ratio .",
    "we generalise to a non - isothermal situation by considering a linear series expansion of the temperature , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a reference temperature and we allow the temperature gradient to be constant and either positive or negative , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is always a positive number .",
    "we begin with hydrostatic balance , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the pressure and @xmath105 is the mass density .",
    "the physical assumption being made is that the buffer or inert gas ( e.g. , molecular hydrogen ) is in hydrostatic equilibrium and the collisional time between itself and the sodium atoms is so short that the latter are effectively coupled to the former as a single fluid .    by using the ideal gas law , @xmath106 , one obtains @xmath107 here , @xmath108 functions like an  effective gravity \" with an additional term associated with the constant temperature gradient .",
    "completing the integration yields @xmath109 where the non - isothermal pressure scale height is @xmath110 and the index , @xmath111 is the ratio of the non - isothermal to the isothermal scale heights .    for @xmath72",

    "the chord optical depth is @xmath117 where the index @xmath118 is @xmath119 the integral in equation ( [ eq : tau_chord_nonisothermal ] ) has no general analytical solution .",
    "however , it is soluble if we consider integer values of @xmath118 .",
    "this is not unreasonable .",
    "for example , for hd 189733b @xcite estimate @xmath120 k km@xmath1 , which yields @xmath121 for @xmath71 . for @xmath122 and 6 ,",

    "the optical depth thus becomes @xmath129 similar in spirit to its isothermal counterpart where we again have the characteristic length scale being @xmath55 .",

    "we will break this degeneracy by using measurements from both sodium lines to determine @xmath102 .",
    "to apply the diagnostics to data requires that both sodium lines are at least partially resolved , such that for each line we may measure the absorption depths at line center and in the line wing .",
    "generally , at the same distance ( @xmath40 ) from line center , the line wings of the d@xmath93 and d@xmath96 sodium lines are sampling different temperatures , which we denote by @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
