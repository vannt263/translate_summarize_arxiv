    "in quantum information the transmission of messages through a noisy environment is described by quantum channels .",
    "they are mathematically represented by completely positive trace  preserving maps acting on the set of the density operators of the quantum system carrying information@xcite .",
    "for this reason the characterization and classification of such maps have attracted a lot of interest in recent years@xcite .",
    "the majority of the results obtained so far relate to two specific classes of channels , i.e. the qubit channels@xcite and the bosonic gaussian channels@xcite .",
    "a quantum channel @xmath0 can be described@xcite as a unitary interaction between the information carrier system @xmath1 and an external environment @xmath2 , prepared in some fixed ( generally ) _ mixed _ state @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 $ ] is the partial trace over the environment and @xmath6 is a unitary operator in the composite hilbert space @xmath7 .",
    "following refs .",
    "we generalize the notion of _ complementary channel _",
    "@xmath8 of @xmath9 of refs .",
    ", by introducing the _ weakly complementary _ channel @xmath10 that maps the input state @xmath11 of the carrier into the state of the environment @xmath2 after the interaction with @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the channel @xmath13 describes , in some sense , the quantum information lost in the environment due to the noise effects .",
    "the quantum channel @xmath0 is then called@xcite weakly degradable when , without having access to the input state of the carrier @xmath11 , one can recover the information lost in the environment during the interaction with @xmath2 only applying a local physical transformation to the final system state after the interaction . in the opposite case",
    ", the channel is called anti - degradable , i.e. the output system state can be obtained acting locally only on the environmental output state ; in this case the quantum capacity can be proved to be equal to zero@xcite .    in a previous paper@xcite",
    "we establish a parallelism among the qubit channels and the bosonic gaussian channels , through a phase - space representation of two - level quantum states@xcite .",
    "therefore , we introduce the set of qubit gaussian channels and we study the weak - degradability properties .",
    "interestingly enough gaussian maps share similar properties in both the qubit and bosonic case . here",
    "we briefly review these results and we apply them to some examples of qubit channels .",
    "the characteristic function description of a qubit can be introduced by properly adapting the formalism of ref . that generalizes the bosonic phase space description to fermionic systems .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "this allows one to define the characteristic function @xmath14 of a density matrix @xmath11 as @xmath15 $ ] where @xmath16 is the qubit displacement operator @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 being a couple of conjugate grassmann variables@xcite . for a generic density operator of the form @xmath21",
    "this yields @xmath22 .",
    "now let us consider the action of a qubit channel @xmath0 on an input state represented by the density operator @xmath11 . using the above definitions one can write@xcite the characteristic function @xmath23 associated with the output state @xmath24 as ^ ( ) & = & d^2 ( ) g ( , ) , where g ( , ) & = & , [ green ] is the green function of the map @xmath0 ( in this expression @xmath25 is the third pauli matrix ) .",
    "the green function representation  ( [ green ] ) gives a complete description of the channel .",
    "in particular let us consider the canonical form of qubit channels of ref .  , i.e. @xmath26 with @xmath27 being a real vector , @xmath28 a vector containing the pauli matrices , @xmath29 the bloch vector describing the input state , and @xmath30 , with the real coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfying certain conditions@xcite .",
    "the corresponding green function is & & g ( , ) = ^(2 ) ( - - ^ * ) + & & + ( _ 3-_1 _ 2)^*+ ^*-^*^ * , [ green.qubit ] with @xmath33 being the dirac delta function associated with the grassmann variable @xmath34@xcite . in analogy with the bosonic case ,",
    "a qubit gaussian channel is defined by having the green function of the form g ( , ) = ^(2 ) ( - a - b ^ * ) [ guass.cond ] , with @xmath35 , @xmath36 complex and @xmath37 real ( see ref . for details ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ green.qubit ] ) the gaussian maps are obtained for @xmath38 , @xmath39 . with a proper parametrization",
    ", the green function of qubit gaussian channels can thus be written as g ( , ) = ^(2 ) ( - + ^ * ) with @xmath40 , @xmath41 in @xmath42 and @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , analogously to what happens in the bosonic case@xcite , the qubit gaussian channels defined here can always be described as `` qubit - qubit '' channels , i.e. in terms of a unitary interaction between a qubit system and a _ single _ ( not necessarily pure ) qubit environment@xcite .",
    "pure environment is obtained when @xmath44 or @xmath45 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 generic .",
    "these channels have been proved@xcite to be weakly degradable for @xmath46 , and anti - degradable otherwise .",
    "if @xmath47 , the single qubit environment @xmath2 is initially prepared in the mixed state @xmath48 , and the channel is weakly degradable@xcite for @xmath46 and with null quantum capacity otherwise .",
    "in the following we will show the green function of some examples of qubit quantum channels@xcite and we will analyze their weak - degradability properties .",
    "the bit flip ( or dephasing channel ) flips the state @xmath49 to @xmath50 ( and viceversa ) with probability @xmath51 .",
    "this map can be obtained from the canonical form above by @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ; it is a qubit - qubit map with pure environment ( q=1 ) .",
    "the relative gaussian green function is : g ( , ) & = & ^(2 ) ( -s - ( s-1 ) ^ * ) .",
    "observing that @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , the bit flip channel is always weakly degradable for any value of s.      the phase flip channel changes the phase of the state @xmath50 with probability @xmath51 ; for instance , @xmath58 is mapped to @xmath59 with probability @xmath51 and with probability @xmath60 it remains unchanged .",
    "this channel has the following ( canonical ) parameters @xmath52 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 and the relative green function is not gaussian , i.e. g ( , ) & = & ^(2 ) ( -(2 s -1 ) ) + 4s(1-s)^ * .",
    "since the canonical form@xcite is uniquely determined only up to unitary transformations , one can permute the @xmath63s and so the phase flip channel is unitarily equivalent to a bit - flip channel . therefore , the phase flip channel is not a gaussian channel but it is unitarily equivalent to a ( weakly degradable ) gaussian map .",
    "the bit - phase flip channel is a combination of a bit flip and a phase flip channels@xcite .",
    "its kraus operators are : a_0 & = &  i =  (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 & 1    )  ,  a_1 =  _ y =  (    cc 0 & -i + i & 0    ) .",
    "the phase - flip channel is obtained with the following parameters @xmath52 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and so it is a qubit - qubit map with pure environment ( q=1 ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath66 .",
    "the green function is so gaussian , i.e. g ( , ) & = & ^(2 ) ( -s - ( 1-s ) ^ * ) . observing that @xmath67 ,",
    "the bit - phase flip channel is always weakly degradable for any value of s.      the depolarizing channel represents an important kind of noise evolution , in which the qubit is _ depolarized _",
    "( i.e. replaced by the completely mixed state , @xmath68 ) with probability @xmath60 and it is left untouched with probability @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the output state , i.e. @xmath70 . in the canonical representation",
    "it is characterized by the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath71 , and , since the green function is not gaussian , i.e. g ( , ) = ^(2 ) ( -(1-s ) ) + s(1-s)^ * , we are not able to discuss its degradability properties in our formalism .",
    "let us consider now a typical process of noise evolution in which a quantum system losses its energy , well implemented by the _ amplitude damping _ channel . in the canonical form the amplitude damping channel is given by @xmath39 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 can be thought of as the probability of losing the system energy . since @xmath76 , it is a qubit - qubit map with pure environment ( q=1 ) .",
    "the gaussian green function has the form g ( , ) & = & ^(2 ) ( - ) . since @xmath77 , the amplitude damping channel is weakly degradable for @xmath78 and anti - degradable for @xmath79 .",
    "here we describe the effect of dissipation due to the presence of an external environment at finite temperature .",
    "this quantum operation , called generalized amplitude damping channel , can be described by the following kraus operators ( @xmath80)@xcite : a_0 & = &  (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 &    )  ,   a_1 =  (    cc 0 & + 0 & 0    )  , + a_2 & = &  (    cc & 0 + 0 & 1    )  ,  a_3 =  (    cc 0 & 0 + & 0    ) .",
    "the generalized amplitude damping channel corresponds to @xmath39 , @xmath81 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the gaussian green function is g ( , ) & = & ^(2 ) ( - ) .",
    "it is a qubit - qubit map with mixed environment ( @xmath82 ) and is weakly degradable for @xmath78 and with null quantum capacity for @xmath79 .",
    "in this work we briefly review the interesting parallelism@xcite among the qubit channels and the bosonic gaussian channels , through a phase - space representation@xcite in terms of generalized characteristic functions for qubits .",
    "it allows one to define the qubit gaussian channels and to study their weak - degradability properties , showing in a elegant way a strong analogy to what is obtained for bosonic gaussian channels .",
    "therefore , we use these results to describe some examples of qubit channels , which play an important role in quantum information science and its applications .",
    "we find that not all qubit channels are gaussian but only those describable trough a noisy interaction between one qubit ( for the system ) and one qubit ( for the environment ) .",
