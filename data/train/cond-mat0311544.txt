    "the model of a two - level atom interacting with a quantum field or many - particle reservoir has shown a remarkable persistence over decades of progress in physics , appearing and reappearing in many guises in different branches of condensed - matter physics after its ` first life ' in quantum optics and magnetic resonance .",
    "it constitutes an idealized , minimal model of quantum dynamics and thermodynamics of _ open _ quantum systems . through the explicit inclusion of a reservoir in the model",
    ", it supports the discussion of an open quantum system without resorting to speculative extensions of quantum mechanics .",
    "the spin - boson problem @xcite is fairly well understood for most parameter regimes relevant to solid - state physics , where the reservoir is characterized by a smooth spectral density running up to a large bandwidth cutoff , which enters the effective physics only as a renormalization parameter .",
    "a rich body of theoretical work on the spin - boson problem was developed in the context of macroscopic quantum coherence @xcite and its realization in superconducting devices as well as the physics of defect tunneling in solids @xcite , to name two early examples .",
    "these results are currently being reapplied and extended in the discussion of performance limits of quantum computers , since the two - level atom of the spin - boson problem can obviously be identified with a qubit subject to a dephasing - inducing environment @xcite .",
    "apart from this general consideration , the spin - boson model also serves as a model for particular realizations , e.g. , the flux qubit @xcite , where physical parameters can be given for the two - level system and its environment .",
    "lastly , it should be mentioned that an intricate formal link has recently been pointed out @xcite between the dynamics of the spin - boson model and both dissipative transport of light particles@xcite in a periodic potential and transport of correlated electrons through a barrier in a 1d conductor @xcite .    in the context of chemical physics , charge transfer and curve - crossing problems form an important context for the spin - boson problem . here",
    "the understanding of the spin - boson dynamics seems less complete : the bandwidth of the dissipative reservoir may be small , or its spectrum may exhibit structured features relating to vibrational spectra .",
    "in addition to the energy scales of the two - level system and a damping constant , other parameters need to be considered . moreover , the spin - boson treatment of chemical phenomena is often considered only a first approximation , since the linear - response assumption for the reservoir is inherent in the model ; a generalization to nonlinear , more complex reservoirs is sometimes warranted . since there is no mature theory of non - linear reservoirs , the straightforward way to achieve such a generalization is the formal inclusion of key degrees of freedom of the reservoir , e.g. , some prominent vibrational modes , in the open system . but even the spin - boson problem itself is not fully understood absent the scaling behaviour found in solid - state physics .",
    "it is not to be expected that a thorough theoretical treatment of the more complex models just indicated can be accomplished by analytic methods alone ; numerical simulations will become more important as larger open systems are studied .",
    "likewise , simulations are likely to help in charting the remaining _ terra incognita _ of the spin - boson problem , e.g. , the electron transfer problem in the inverted regime .",
    "future progress will place competing demands on numerical methods which most established algorithms can not meet at the same time : acceptable scaling of computational complexity with _ both _ system size and time interval simulated@xcite .",
    "additionally , the method should take into account the generally non - markovian nature of quantum fluctuations .",
    "the usual starting point for the theoretical description of an open quantum system beyond perturbation theory , by now more or less canonical , uses the path integral formalism , which allows the exact treatment of quantum memory effects @xcite .",
    "since quantum memory effects do not allow the path integral to be translated into a simple differential equation of motion , this limits the choice of theoretical and numerical approaches available .",
    "the direct evaluation of path integrals using monte carlo sampling is a reliable method for short to intermediate times @xcite but becomes prohibitively expensive at long times due to the dynamical sign problem .",
    "the recursive evaluation of a path integral using the quasiadiabatic path - integral discretization ( quapi ) allows propagation to arbitrarily long times , but needs computational resources which grow very rapidly with increasing system size or memory time @xcite .",
    "more recently , stochastic approaches have allowed a transition from the path integral description to equations of motion @xcite .",
    "similar to the intuitive  and computationally advantageous ",
    "representation of classical dissipative systems through the motion of a phase - space point under the influence of thermal noise and friction , an open quantum system can be described by the stochastic propagation of pure quantum states @xcite .",
    "favourable scaling with system size seems an _ intrinsic _ feature common to these approaches  the computational complexity of the open - system simulation as a function of system size remains the same as that of simulating the same quantum system without external interaction .",
    "the remainder of this article is largely devoted to the question how the second objective , good scaling for long - time dynamics , can be achieved in the presence of memory effects . for tests of this performance aspect ,",
    "the spin - boson system is a prime candidate , since comparison results are readily available .",

    "an appendix presents the derivation of a mathematical result needed in section [ sec : sln ] .",
    "although a connection between the influence functional formalism and classical coloured noise in quantum dynamics was pointed out already in the seminal work of feynman and vernon @xcite , it has been put to use in the theory and in simulations of open quantum systems only recently @xcite ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "the key ideas of one such stochastic approach to open quantum systems @xcite will be outlined in this section using a more general model than the spin - boson model , commonly known as the caldeira - legget model .",

    "the dynamics of the harmonic reservoir is usually of little interest ; moreover , due to the large size of the total system , only a reduced description from which the oscillators have been eliminated is simple enough to be practically treatable .",
    "although master equations have been frequently been used with considerable success in weak - coupling scenarios such as quantum optics @xcite , a formally exact reduced formalism , usually necessary in a condensed - matter context , is known only in path integral formalism .",

    "sln simulations using eq .",
    "( [ eq : slnnum ] ) are highly accurate for times below the threshold time . in the light of these facts",

    "again , guide trajectories enter an exponential factor distinguishing normalized and unnormalized states , but here a single factor is used for different noise realizations ,    @xmath82    with @xmath83 for initially normalized states , this keeps the sum over traces identical to @xmath77 .",
