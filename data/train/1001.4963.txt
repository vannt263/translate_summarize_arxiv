    "high power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells are one key criterium for a use of organic semiconductors in industrial applications . until now , by improving process parameters , bulk heterojunction solar cell efficiencies of up to 5% are reached by several groups using well known materials like poly(3-hexylthiophene ) ( p3ht ) and phenyl - c61-butyric acid methyl ester ( pcbm ) blends @xcite .",
    "recently , by introducing new organic semiconductors providing advantageous energy levels and charge carrier mobilities , verified efficiencies of up to 6% and internal quantum yields of almost 100% could be achieved @xcite .",
    "these examples show how important it is to design optimized organic semiconductor for solar cell applications . in order to predict the influence of charge carrier mobilities ,",
    "numerical calculations have been performed , showing power conversion maxima at a certain mobility equal for electrons and holes @xcite.further macroscopic simulations based on the detailed balance framework confirmed this prediction , but pointed out that a finite surface recombination at the electrodes can avoid a lowering of the power conversion efficiency at high charge carrier mobilities @xcite .",
    "as simplification , all those calculation either implicitly assumed an infinite surface recombination rate for the contacts or do not discuss the influence of such details like the combined effects of finite surface recombination rates and a limited bulk , e.g. bimolecular , recombination .",
    "+ in this paper , we present how charge carrier mobilities and surface recombination processes of electrons and holes influence the power conversion efficiencies of an organic solar cell .",

    "to calculate current  voltage characteristics of organic solar cells , a differential equation system of discretized poisson and continuity equations for electrons and holes has to be solved as already shown in @xcite .",

    "reduced ( finite ) majority surface recombination velocities describe charges taking time to overcome injection or extraction barriers at the interface . for minority charges , a reduced surface recombination velocity results in a lower current of minority charges diffusing into the electrode , e.g. caused by mirror charge effects at the metallic electrode .",

    "+ beginning at low mobilities , the short circuit current rapidly increases to a saturated level for moderate and high mobilities . under the influence of a finite minority surface recombination rate , this saturated current is further increased due to surface passivation , preventing minority charges to cross the electrode interface so that they finally recombine there with majority charge carriers . introducing an additional majority surface recombination rate , creating a space charge at the electrodes , @xmath39 is reduced again by enhanced bulk recombination processes in those space charge areas .",

    "at velocities smaller than @xmath48 m/s , the short circuit current drops drastically .",
    "+ bringing both surface recombination effects together ( figure [ fig : surfdetail ] , green line ) leads to a constant and enhanced open circuit potential which is dominated by @xmath13 . the short circuit current as well as the fill factor first benefit from the positive influences of the minority surface recombination , but then are decreased by a dominant majority surface recombination , being even more pronounced in case of the fill factor .",
    "a lot of research efforts have been put into investigating the bulk recombination in bulk heterojunction solar cells . up to now , the effect of surface recombination has been largely ignored .",
    "nevertheless , both types of recombination need to be considered as they are crucial for optimizing the power conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices .",
    "previously , it has been shown that organic solar cells have an efficiency peak atmoderatemobilities , but the efficiency decreases again , driven by a lowered open circuit voltage , at higher mobilities . in this contribution",
    ", we have shown that this behavior can only be observed for perfectly conducting contacts , implying ideal charge extraction and langevin recombination , in which the decay rate is limited by the probability of charges finding one another for recombination",
    ". however , both assumptions are not generally applicable . in organic devices ,",
    "the charge extraction is not ideal , and langevin recombination is only reasonable for rather low mobilities ; for fast charge carriers , the recombination rate limiting step is not the finding , but the actual recombination process .",
    "therefore , in our calculations of power conversion efficiencies for bulk heterojunction solar cells , we considered a bulk recombination following langevin behaviour at low mobilities and a constant rate beyond .",
    "furthermore , we accounted for surface passivating finite minority surface recombination velocities .",
    "the combination of both physically justified processes leads to enhanced power conversion efficiencies which do not decrease once a maximum for a certain mobility has been reached , but increase further and finally saturate at high mobilities .",
