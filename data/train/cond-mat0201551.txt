    "the close connection between symmetry and degeneracy has been explored since the foundation of quantum mechanics .",
    "famous examples include degeneracies of spectra in angular momentum in the hydrogen atom ( well known as the accidental degeneracy ) @xcite and the 3d harmonic oscillator @xcite . in the present paper we focus on the implications of the rich symmetry structure for the spectrum of the 1d hubbard model as well as for a general class of quantum integrable systems .",
    "we analyze in detail how degeneracies and other spectral properties of the hubbard hamiltonian reflect the symmetries of the model .    here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of hamiltonians that depend on a single real parameter , referred to as a coupling . in this case",
    "one can distinguish between two types of degeneracy .",
    "the first type , often called permanent degeneracy , refers to energy levels which remain degenerate for all values of the parameter .",
    "the appearance of permanent degeneracies suggests the existence of non  commuting symmetry operators ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the second type of degeneracy is a crossing of energy levels that occurs at a particular value of the coupling .",
    "multiple level crossings at a certain point indicate a higher symmetry of the system at this particular point as compared to other points .",
    "for example , the limits of zero or infinite coupling frequently have enhanced symmetry .",
    "simple pairwise crossings are also interesting from a different perspective . as is well known , in the absence of symmetries energy levels repel , or , equivalently , crossings of levels are prohibited unless the states have different symmetry .",
    "this _ noncrossing rule _ was suggested by hund in 1927 @xcite , and justified by von neumann and wigner @xcite two years latter . since then",
    "the level repulsion phenomenon has been revisited and elaborated upon in various contexts , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "usually textbooks , e.g. , @xcite , present a simplified version of the justification due to teller @xcite .",
    "the mathematical validity of the noncrossing rule depends crucially on the interpretation of the word symmetry , normally understood as a space ( or internal space ) symmetry .",
    "this was highlighted by an interesting example by heilmann and lieb in 1971 @xcite .",
    "these authors pointed out that the noncrossing rule is apparently violated in the case of the 1d hubbard hamiltonian for the benzene molecule if only those symmetries that do not depend on the coupling constant are taken into account .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ h1 ] illustrates that a substantial number of crossings can be found even within the subsets of levels characterized by the same set of quantum numbers .",
    "based on this fact , heilmann and lieb concluded that `` there must be a natural parameter dependent group''to account for these violations .",
    "the 1d hubbard model is solvable by bethe s _ ansatz _ , and usually the applicability of this _ ansatz _ is understood to rest upon _ quantum integrability _ of the model , i.e the existence of an infinite number of mutually commuting operators .",
    "such commuting operators are often alternately termed as `` conserved currents '' , or `` dynamical conservation laws '' , or simply `` dynamical symmetries '' , and are invariably associated with all known quantum integrable models .",
    "however , it was not until 1986 when the parameter dependent integrals of motion ( conserved currents ) , were identified by shastry @xcite , who constructed a transfer matrix that commuted with the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "= 3.0 in = 4.0 in    the hubbard hamiltonian to be considered consists of the kinetic term , which allows electrons to hop between the nearest neighbors on a regular polygon ( i.e. periodic boundary conditions are assumed ) and the coulomb interaction between electrons of opposite spin on the same site .",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron of spin projection @xmath9 on site @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the number operator . the goal of this paper is to study how the interplay between parameter dependent integrals of motion and ordinary ( parameter independent ) symmetries is manifested in permanent degeneracies and level crossings in the energy spectrum .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is chosen as a tutorial example of a many body system that has both parameter dependent and parameter independent symmetries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 is devoted to parameter independent symmetries of the hubbard model that are later used in section  4 to diagonalize the hamiltonian and assign symmetry quantum numbers such as the total momentum , spin , particle  hole symmetry etc . to all states .",
    "section  3 discusses the structure and properties of parameter dependent conservation laws .",
    "permanent degeneracies are treated in detail in section  5 . in the same section we consider the multiple permanent degeneracies and mention spectral properties of the dynamical conservation laws .    in section 6",
    "we formulate the noncrossing rule in the framework of adiabatic equations of motion for matrix elements of the hamiltonian and higher currents .",
    "this language is useful for understanding the suppression of level repulsion in integrable models .",
    "next , based on numerical analysis , we discuss a curious behavior of the transverse matrix element in the vicinity of crossings specific to the hubbard hamiltonian . finally , to illustrate the connection between level crossings and integrability we consider in some detail a simple case of integrable @xmath12 matrix systems ( section 6 ) . in this case",
    "we conclude that there are no `` accidental degeneracies '' , i.e. all degeneracies may be associated with dynamical conservation laws .",
    "the majority of the results do not depend on the number of sites ( @xmath13 ) or electrons ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , cases of even and odd @xmath13 and @xmath14 have to be treated differently , the latter case being substantially simpler because of less symmetry that needs to be taken into account .",
    "we therefore take for concreteness that both these numbers are even , @xmath15 and @xmath16 with an equal number of spin up and spin down electrons . throughout the paper analytical results are illustrated by numerical computations for a special case of benzene ( @xmath17 ) , and a few other choices of @xmath18 .",
    "the starting point of our analysis of the spectral properties of the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is the list of its u  independent symmetries .",
    "we will follow closely the paper by heilmann and lieb @xcite adopting in most cases their notation .",
    "the role of the u  independent symmetries is twofold .",
    "first , they greatly simplify the diagonalization of the hamiltonian and integrals of motion and provide a convenient labeling for various parts of the spectrum . besides , for the purposes of studying specifically the effect of parameter dependent conservation laws all these symmetries have to be factored out anyway .",
    "u  independent symmetries fall into three major categories  the symmetry of the polygon , the spin symmetry , and the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "spatial symmetries can be generated by two operators : operator @xmath19 that rotates the polygon by @xmath20 , and operator @xmath21 that reflects it in a line through vertices @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ poly ] ) . these operators can be expressed in terms of on site creation and annihilation operators as @xmath24 where @xmath25 interchanges the orbitals @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 eigenvalues of @xmath19 are @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an integer @xmath31 that represents the total momentum of the state .",
    "the reflection operator @xmath21 has eigenvalues @xmath32 .",
    "the spin symmetry can be generated by @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37    to describe the particle - hole symmetry we first define operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the operator @xmath38 changes the sign of the wave - function each time there is a spin @xmath9 electron on an odd site , while the operator @xmath39 interchanges holes and particles for a spin direction @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath40 it is convenient to introduce the following combinations of these operators : @xmath41 note the action of various symmetries on the creation and annihilation operators @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 it follows from equations ( [ ztr ] ) and ( [ iotr ] ) that @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a state with @xmath49 spin up electrons and @xmath50 spin down electrons , and @xmath23 is the number of sites .",
    "thus , operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 conserve the number of particles only at a half filling with an equal number of up and down electrons .",
    "equations ( [ ztr ] ) and ( [ iotr ] ) are used to evaluate various commutation relations for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53=0 \\label{main}\\ ] ] @xmath54= \\{\\hat j^{(o ) } , \\hat t\\}=\\{\\hat i^{(o ) } , \\hat s_z\\}= [ \\hat i^{(o ) } , { \\bf\\hat s}^2]=0 \\label{rest}\\ ] ] @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the kinetic energy operator @xmath59    @xmath52 is a unitary operator that anticommutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore it defines a mapping from the set of operators that commute with the hamiltonian onto itself , i.e. @xmath60=0 $ ] implies @xmath61=0 $ ] . using this transformation",
    ", we can construct a new @xmath62 algebra ( @xmath63-pairing @xmath62 ) from the spin @xmath62 ( [ spinsu2 ] ) @xcite . @xmath64",
    "the casimir operator of this new @xmath62 @xmath65 preserves the number of particles and therefore its eigenvalues @xmath66 can be included in the set of quantum numbers used to label the eigenstates .",
    "the combination @xmath67 yields the complete @xmath68 symmetry of the hubbard hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "now let us turn to the parameter dependent integrals of motion . in principle",
    ", an infinite number of these integrals can be obtained by methods outlined in @xcite .",
    "clearly , on a finite lattice only a finite number of these integrals are independent ( see section  6 for more details ) .",
    "the general form of the @xmath69th conserved current is @xmath70 where @xmath71 are parameter independent operators . the u ",
    "independent part of @xmath72 has a simple form @xmath73    as far as permanent degeneracies are concerned , an important feature of the currents is that odd ( @xmath74 ) and even ( @xmath75 ) currents transform differently ( equations ( [ oddsigma])([evenz ] ) ) under spatial reflections ( @xmath76 ) and partial particle - hole transformation ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "odd currents are in many respects similar to the hamiltonian , while properties of even currents are essentially different .",
    "first few nontrivial currents were derived explicitly in @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite and @xcite for a discussion on the derivation and the structure of the higher conserved currents . ) to analyze the benzene example we will need the explicit form of only the first two nontrivial integrals of motion . since @xmath77",
    ", these two are @xmath78    @xmath79    odd currents have the same u  independent symmetry as the hubbard hamiltonian , i.e. in all commutation relations of section  2 the hamiltonian can be replaced with any other odd current . for even currents two of the commutation relations are different .",
    "namely , for odd currents one can show that @xmath80=0 \\label{oddsigma}\\ ] ] @xmath81 while for even currents @xmath82 @xmath83=0 \\label{evenz}\\ ] ] in other words , equations ( [ oddsigma][evenz ] ) mean that even and odd currents have different @xmath76 and @xmath52 parities . for @xmath84 equations ( [ oddsigma][evenz ] )",
    "have been derived in @xcite .",
    "note also that since both @xmath76 and @xmath52 are unitary and @xmath85 is hermitian , equations ( [ evensigma ] ) and ( [ oddz ] ) imply @xmath86 another property of conserved currents which we will use bellow is @xmath87 equations ( [ oddsigma])([evenz ] ) and ( [ tsign ] ) for @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be verified by inspection . for higher currents",
    "they can be derived by establishing the transformation properties of the transfer matrix obtained in @xcite .",
    "finally , let us measure @xmath90 , @xmath91 and all other energies in units of @xmath92 .",
    "this is equivalent to the replacement @xmath93 we see from ( [ tsign ] ) that the spectrum and the eigenfunctions of @xmath72 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 are related via a simple transformation and it is therefore sufficient to consider @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we have to compute the spectra only for @xmath96 .",
    "in this section we outline a method that we use for detailed numerical study of the spectra of the hamiltonian and conserved currents . in subsequent sections",
    "we will compare the computer generated results for benzene ( @xmath17 ) and several other values of @xmath97 and @xmath22 to general predictions based on symmetry .    from the results of section 2",
    "it follows that the set of quantum numbers that label the eigenstates of the hamiltonian and integrals of motion is @xmath98 . however , there are certain restrictions on this set since not all symmetries and integrals of motion mutually commute .",
    "the quantum number @xmath99 can be assigned only when @xmath100 and @xmath101 can be used only when @xmath102 or @xmath103 ( see ( [ totcons ] ) and ( [ sigmam ] ) ) . also , since @xmath76 changes @xmath30 to @xmath104 without affecting the energy and other quantum numbers , the spectrum for @xmath105 is the exact copy of that for @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to diagonalize the hamiltonian and the currents for @xmath30 ranging from 0 to @xmath22 . finally , since even currents anticommute with @xmath76 , their eigenvalues can not be specified whenever @xmath101 is specified .    to utilize the conservation of momentum ,",
    "we introduce in the usual way the momentum space creation and annihilation operators @xmath107 and @xmath108 @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "next , we choose a basis for @xmath111-electron wave functions with @xmath97 spin up and @xmath97 spin down electrons . @xmath112 with the following ordering convention @xmath113 components of @xmath114 that are not in the interval @xmath115 $ ] have to be reduced modulo @xmath23 into this interval .",
    "if the components of a vector are not in the order ( [ order ] ) they have to be permuted to obtain these ordering and the wave function should be multiplied by @xmath116 if the permutation is odd .",
    "the total momentum of the state is @xmath117    from ( [ ztr][sigmatr ] ) and ( [ d ] ) we identify the action of operators of u  independent symmetry on basic states ( [ basis ] ) @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the total momentum of spin down electrons , @xmath122 denotes taking the complement of the set @xmath123 in the set of integers from 0 to @xmath124 . finally , @xmath125 stands for adding @xmath22 to each component of a vector .",
    "the rotation operator @xmath19 commutes with the hamiltonian , conserved currents , @xmath51 , @xmath33 , and @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , these operators split into blocks corresponding to different values of @xmath30 .",
    "this significantly reduces the size of the matrices to be diagonalized . to generate the blocks for each value of @xmath30 we need to derive the matrix elements of the hamiltonian , integrals of motion , and symmetry operators in the basis ( [ basis ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ sigmam ] ) and ( [ i m ] ) allow to write down @xmath76 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in the matrix notation .",
    "matrix elements of the hamiltonian , and the operators @xmath33 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 are summarized in appendix  b.    now we have all ingredients needed to produce a computer program ( e.g. on _ mathematica _ ) that generates exact blocks of the hamiltonian , symmetry operators , and first two currents for any value of the total momentum @xmath30 .",
    "after the value of the total momentum @xmath30 is chosen , the program picks one of the remaining u ",
    "independent symmetries , say @xmath76 , and finds a unitary transformation that makes it diagonal .",
    "the columns of the matrix of this transformation are the eigenvectors of @xmath76 .",
    "since we know the eigenvalues of @xmath76 exactly @xmath129 , determining the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue reduces to a set of linear equations which can be solved analytically .    in this way ,",
    "step by step , we diagonalize all parameter independent symmetries and split the hamiltonian and conserved currents into smaller blocks . if the system is not too large , this can be done analytically using _",
    "mathematica_. for example , the complete hamiltonian for benzene is a @xmath130 matrix , while individual blocks range in size from @xmath131 to @xmath132 .    finally , when all u",
    " independent symmetry is exhausted , we get exact blocks of the hamiltonian and conserved currents with all u  independent symmetry quantum numbers assigned to each block .",
    "each block is then diagonalized individually at different values of @xmath133 ranging from 0 to 1 ( see ( [ ut ] ) ) .",
    "often , the small size of a block allows for analytical diagonalization .",
    "as soon as the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is diagonalized , we discover numerous cases of permanent degeneracy , see e.g. table  [ nmbs ] and fig .",
    "[ h1 ] , [ h2 ] , and [ h3 ] .",
    "we make the following observations .",
    "the majority of degeneracies are twofold degeneracies with respect to @xmath134 . however , there are also several multiply degenerate levels .",
    "the characteristic feature of these states is that the energies are linear in @xmath90 .",
    ".degrees of degeneracy in the sectors @xmath135 for @xmath136 [ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see from table  [ nmbs ] that at small @xmath97 and @xmath22 a substantial fraction of levels are nondegenerate .",
    "next , we consider the limit @xmath137 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath138 depends on the greatest common divider of @xmath97 and @xmath22 . however , this is not essential for large @xmath22 , since we can always decrease or increase @xmath22 by a small number so that @xmath97 and @xmath22 become mutually prime , in which case the dimension of @xmath135 subspace is @xmath139 of the total dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "@xmath140 to analyze the behavior of @xmath141 in the limit @xmath137 , we note that there are two ways how a number of terms in ( [ ker ] ) can cancel .",
    "the first option is the pairwise cancellation . alternatively",
    ", @xmath69 terms can cancel if their momenta correspond to the vertices of the regular @xmath69gon .",
    "this can happen only if @xmath22 is divisible by @xmath69 .",
    "for a given @xmath142 there are at most four other momenta with which it can cancel pairwise . therefore , for @xmath137 the number of ways in which the sum ( [ ker ] ) can cancel pairwise grows slower than @xmath143 , while the number of non - pairwise cancellations grows slower than @xmath144 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath145 this asymptotics combined with numerical values from table  [ d / d ] suggests that almost all states in the sector @xmath135 are at least twofold degenerate in the thermodynamical limit .    as for",
    "the multiply degenerate states the first observation is that , at least for benzene , all of their eigenvalues are linear in the coupling parameter @xmath133 .",
    "this seems to suggest that these states are simultaneous eigenstates of the kinetic ( @xmath58 ) and the potential ( @xmath146 ) energy operators ( [ ut ] ) .",
    "indeed , this turns out to be the case for the majority of the multiply degenerate levels for benzene .",
    "however , the benzene hamiltonian also has two eigenstates with @xmath147 and @xmath148 that are not simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath58 and @xmath146 .    some of the multiply degenerate states can be obtained using the prescription of @xcite",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "we take a state @xmath114 that has only one species of electrons , say @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) spin down electrons , and no spin up electrons @xmath151 clearly , @xmath114 is an eigenstate of both @xmath58 and @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath152 on the other hand , @xmath114 is a lowest weight state in the @xmath153 algebra constructed from @xmath154 and @xmath155 @xmath156 the energy according to ( [ tu ] ) is @xmath157 if @xmath158 , we can get an eigenstate @xmath159 with @xmath97 spin up and @xmath97 spin down electrons , by applying the raising operators of the @xmath153 algebra @xmath160 the total number of states that can be obtained in this way is @xmath161 while the number of states that have the same energy ( [ mltpl ] ) can not exceed @xmath162 . for @xmath17",
    "the allowed choices for @xmath163 are @xmath164 .",
    "the choice @xmath165 yields 15 eigenstates of which 3 states have the total momentum @xmath148 and are degenerate with the energy @xmath166 . by partial particle - hole symmetry ( [ zpsi ] )",
    "the choice @xmath167 also gives 3 states with @xmath148 and the energy @xmath168 .",
    "the actual number of states of energy @xmath169 and @xmath148 is 7 ( table  [ nmbs ] ) .",
    "wave functions of 6 of these states are independent of @xmath90 .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that contrary to what was conjectured in @xcite , not all u  independent eigenstates can be obtained using the above prescription .",
    "the six u  independent eigenstates together with the corresponding states that have lowest weight in @xmath153 are given in appendix a.    clearly , the multiple degeneracies discussed above mean that there is an additional u  independent symmetry of the hubbard hamiltonian that have been overlooked in section 2 .",
    "this symmetry seems to be related to the high degeneracy of the spectra of the potential and kinetic energy operators .",

    "the spectra of the hamiltonian and conserved currents display numerous cases of crossings of levels that have the same u  independent symmetry quantum numbers . in this section",

    "the system ( [ func ] ) has no solutions if and only if @xmath181 and @xmath182 for some @xmath183 , @xmath10 , and @xmath184 .",

    "after all these symmetries are factored out , at a certain value of @xmath133 all states in a given block are nondegenerate .",

    "we call a pair @xmath221 integrable if these two matrices commute @xmath222=0 \\label{com}\\ ] ] since we can always add multiples of the identity matrix to @xmath174 and @xmath223 without affecting integrability ( [ com ] ) or any of the level crossings , with no loss of generality , we can assume that both @xmath174 and @xmath223 are traceless @xmath224 further , we say that a pair @xmath221 is trivial if the @xmath133 dependence can be eliminated from either @xmath174 or @xmath223 by a @xmath133independent unitary transformation ( change of basis ) and ( or ) by taking linear combinations of @xmath174 and @xmath223 .",
    "first we demonstrate that if @xmath221 is a nontrivial integrable pair , both @xmath172 and @xmath225 have a single level crossing .",
    "indeed , one can check that by changing the basis and taking linear combinations any nontrivial integrable pair can be brought to the following `` canonical '' form : @xmath226+u\\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } v_{11}&0&v_{13}\\\\ 0&v_{22}&v_{23}\\\\ v_{13}&v_{23}&-v_{11}-v_{22}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right ] \\label{3h}\\ ] ] @xmath227+u\\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } w_{11}&w_{12}&w_{13}\\\\ w_{12 } & w_{22}&w_{23}\\\\ w_{13}&w_{23}&-w_{11}-w_{22}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right ] \\label{3i}\\ ] ] matrix elements of @xmath228 can be written in terms of @xmath229 s using ( [ com ] ) .",
    "@xmath230 since @xmath228 has five independent matrix elements , while @xmath231 has only four , @xmath232 s are constrained by @xmath233    @xmath172 has an apparent crossing at @xmath212 .",
    "further , it turns out that the matrix @xmath225 has a crossing if and only if the constraint ( [ constr ] ) is met !",
    "this can be verified either directly or using @xcite , where , among other things , degeneracies of real symmetric @xmath219 matrices are analyzed in detail .",
    "the crossing of @xmath223 is at @xmath234 similarly , it can be shown that linear combinations of @xmath174 and @xmath223 always have crossings too . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath221 is a nontrivial integrable pair , both @xmath172 and @xmath225 have a single level crossing .",
    "now let us show that the converse is also true , i.e. that any real symmetric @xmath219 matrix that has a pairwise crossing is also integrable .",
    "we start with a real symmetric @xmath219 matrix @xmath235 that has a pairwise crossing at @xmath214 . by redefining the parameter @xmath236 and a suitable choice of basis we can write @xmath174 in the form ( [ 3h ] ) .",
    "therefore , there exists a matrix @xmath223 of the form ( [ 3i ] ) such that @xmath237=0 $ ] . in view of this explicit construction of a `` dynamical conservation law '' , we may say that there are no accidental degeneracies in the case of @xmath12 real matrices .",
    "finally , we note that the linear term in expansion ( [ trans ] ) is non zero for both @xmath174 and @xmath223 unless specially arranged .",
    "we have shown that for all @xmath97 and @xmath22 except @xmath238 and @xmath239 there are twofold permanent degeneracies for the values of the total momentum @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "these degeneracies are a consequence of different transformation properties of even and odd currents with respect to spatial reflections ( @xmath21 ) and partial particle - hole transformation ( @xmath52 ) ( equations ( [ oddsigma][evenz ] ) ) .",
    "we have argued that in the thermodynamical limit the fraction of doubly degenerate states in the sector @xmath135 approaches one . for benzene ( @xmath17 ) we have checked that all doubly degenerate states are maped into each other by the first even current @xmath127 .",
    "we have also seen that some states can be nondegenerate since all even currents have nontrivial kernels .",
    "we have learned from the benzene example that there is a number of multiply degenerate states that are simultaneous eigenstates of the potential and kinetic energy operators .",
    "the wave functions of these states do not depend on the coupling @xmath90 .",
    "this suggests the existence of an additional u  independent symmetry .",
    "however , as we have seen in section  5 and appendix  a some of these states can not be obtained by applying the raising ( lowering ) operators of the @xmath153 algebra to states that have only one species of electrons .",
    "further , we have demonstrated how the constraints of the noncrossing rule are lifted in integrable models .",
    "in fact , we have argued that in integrable models crossings of levels with the same parameter independent symmetry quantum numbers are expected .",
    "this was also illustrated by a simple example of @xmath12 matrix models where there is a one to one correspondence between crossings and integrability .",
    "we have seen that for @xmath17 the first two nontrivial conserved currents are sufficient to explain all cases of level crossings .",
    "we have shown numerically that in the case of benzene the transverse matrix element is quadratic in energy difference in the vicinity of all pairwise level crossings .      1 .",
    "what is the symmetry responsible for the multiply ( more than twofold ) degenerate levels in the spectrum of the hubbard hamiltonian ?",
    "are energies of multiply degenerate states always linear in the coupling parameter ?",
    "how one can count the degrees of degeneracy and the number of multiply degenerate states for arbitrary @xmath97 and @xmath22 ?",

    "in this section we collect the expressions for the matrix elements of the hamiltonian , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath257 be the momenta of spin up electrons that are in @xmath258 but not in @xmath259 , @xmath260 be the momenta that are in @xmath261 but not in @xmath262 .",
