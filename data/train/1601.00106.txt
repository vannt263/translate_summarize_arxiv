    "i never met john bell , but his writings have supplied me with a continual source of new insights as i read and reread them over 40 years . in working toward a rather different understanding of quantum mechanics",
    "he has been foremost in my mind as a severe but honest critic of such attempts .",
    "we all would love to know what einstein would have made of bell s theorem .",
    "i confess the deep regret i feel that bell can not respond to this paper is sometimes assuaged by a sense of relief .",
    "in his seminal 1964 paper , john bell expressed locality as the requirement    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ that the result of a measurement on one system be unaffected by operations on a distant system with which it has interacted in the past .",

    "then the result of the measurement might have been different even if exactly the same operations ( if any ) had been performed on that distant system .",
    "so can no indeterministic theory satisfy the locality requirement ?",
    "bell felt no need to address that awkward question in his 1964 paper , since he took  the epr argument to establish that any additional variables needed to restore locality and causality would have to determine a unique result of a measurement .",
    "indeterminism was not an option :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ since we can predict in advance the result of measuring any chosen component of @xmath0 [ in the bohm - epr  scenario ] , by previously measuring the same component of @xmath1 , it follows that the result of any such measurement must actually be predetermined .",

    "this argument warrants closer examination , and i ll come back to it .",
    "but in later work bell offered formulations of locality conditions tailored to theories that were not deterministic .",
    "an initial motivation may have been to facilitate experimental tests of attempted local , causal completions of quantum mechanics by suitable measurements of spin or polarization components on pairs of separated systems represented by entangled quantum states .",
    "inevitable apparatus imperfections would make it impossible to confirm a quantum prediction of perfect ( anti)correlation for matched components , so experiment alone could not require a local , causal theory to reproduce them .",
    "einstein himself thought some theory might come to underlie quantum mechanics much as statistical mechanics underlies thermodynamics . in each case",
    "there would be circumstances in which the more basic theory ( correctly ) predicts deviations from behavior the less basic theory leads one to expect .    but by 1975",
    "a second motivation had become apparent ",
    "the hope that by revising or reformulating quantum mechanics as a theory of local beables one might remove ambiguity and arrive at increased precision .",
    "it is in this context that bell now introduces a requirement of local causality .",
    "this differs in two ways from his earlier locality requirement .",
    "it is not a requirement on the world , but on theories of local beables : and it applies to theories that are probabilistic , with deterministic theories treated as a special case in which all probabilities are 0 or 1 ( and densities are delta functions).[multiblock footnote omitted ] bell ( [ 1975 ] , [ 1985 ] ) designs his requirement of local causality as a generalization of a requirement of local determinism met by maxwell s electromagnetic theory . in source - free maxwellian electromagnetism ,",
    "the local beables are the values of the electric and magnetic fields at each point @xmath2 .",
    "this theory is locally deterministic because the field values in a space - time region are uniquely determined by their values at an earlier moment in a finite volume of space that fully closes the backward light cone of that region .",
    "local causality arises by generalizing to theories in which the assignment of values to some beables @xmath3 implies , not necessarily a particular value , but a probability distribution @xmath4 , for another beable @xmath5 . here",

    "these elements function in other ways when a quantum model is applied in predicting or explaining physical phenomena such as non - localized correlations .",
    "assignment of a quantum state may be viewed as merely the first step in a procedure that licenses a user of quantum mechanics to express claims about physical systems in descriptive language and then warrants that user in adopting appropriate epistemic attitudes toward some of these claims .",

    "the quantum state has two roles .",
    "one is in the algorithm provided by the born rule for assigning probabilities to significant claims of the form @xmath119 : the value of @xmath9 on @xmath120 lies in @xmath121 , where @xmath9 is a physical magnitude , @xmath120 is a physical system and @xmath121 is a borel set of real numbers . in",

    "but the significance of a claim like @xmath126 varies with the circumstances to which it relates .",
    "accordingly , a quantum state plays a second role by modulating the content of @xmath126 or any other magnitude claim by modifying its inferential relations to other claims . because i believe the nature of this modulation of content renders inappropriate the metaphor of magnitudes corresponding to elements of reality , i recommend against thinking of magnitudes that figure in canonical or other magnitude claims as beables , even though many such magnitude claims are true .",
    "but if one insists on calling magnitudes that figure in magnitude claims beables , these magnitudes are not beables introduced by quantum mechanics ",
    "they are at most beables recognized in its applications .. ]    the quantum state is not a beable in this view . indeed , since none of the distinctively quantum elements of a quantum model qualifies as a beable introduced by the theory , quantum mechanics has no beables of its own .",
    "viewed this way , a quantum state does not describe or represent some new element of physical reality .",
    ": `` ... this does not bother us if we do not grant beable status to the wave - function . '' ] but nor is it the quantum state s role to describe or represent the epistemic state of any actual agent .",
    "a quantum state assignment is objectively true ( or false ) : in that deflationary sense a quantum state is objectively real . but its function is not to say what the world is like but to help an agent applying quantum mechanics to predict and explain what happens in it . it is physical conditions in the world that make a quantum state assignment true ( or false ) .",
    "true quantum state assignments are backed by true magnitude claims , though some of these are typically about physical systems other than that to which the state is assigned .",
    "any application of quantum mechanics involves claims describing a physical situation . while it is considered appropriate to make claims about where individual particles are detected contributing to the interference pattern in a contemporary interference experiment , claims about through which slit each particle went are frequently alleged to be meaningless . in its second role the quantum state offers guidance on the inferential powers , and hence the content , of canonical magnitude claims .",
    "the key idea here is that even assuming unitary evolution of a joint quantum state of system and environment , delocalization of system state coherence into the environment will typically render descriptive claims about experimental outcomes and the condition of apparatus and other macroscopic objects appropriate by endowing these claims with enough content to license an agent to adopt epistemic attitudes toward them , and in particular to apply the born rule .",
    "but an application of quantum mechanics to determine whether this is so will not require referring to any system as macroscopic , as an apparatus  or as an environment .",
    "all that counts is how a quantum state of a super - system evolves in a model , given a hamiltonian associated with an interaction between the system of interest and the rest of that super - system .",
    "it is important to note that since the formulation of the born rule now involves no explicit or implicit reference to measurement , bell s ( [ 2004 , pp .",
    "213 - 31 ] ) strictures against the presence of the term ` measurement ' in a precise formulation of quantum mechanics are met .",
    "none of the other proscribed terms ` classical ' , ` macroscopic ' , ` irreversible ' , or ` information ' appears in its stead .",
    "since an agent s assignment of a quantum state does not serve to represent a system s properties , her reassignment of a collapsed  state on gaining new information represents no change in that system s properties . that is why collapse is not a physical process , in this view of quantum mechanics . nor does the schrdinger equation express a fundamental physical law : to assign a quantum state to a system is not to represent its dynamical properties .",
    "a formulation of quantum mechanics has no need to include a statement distinguishing the circumstances in which physical processes of schrdinger evolution and collapse  occur .",
    "an agent can use quantum mechanics to track changes of the dynamical properties of a system by noting what magnitude claims are significant and true of it at various times .",
    "but quantum mechanics itself does not imply any such claim , even when an agent would be correct to assign a system a quantum state , appropriately apply the born rule , and conclude that the claim has probability 1 .",
    "quantum states are relational on this interpretation .",
    "when agents ( actually or merely hypothetically ) occupy relevantly different physical situations they should assign different quantum states to one and the same system , even though these different quantum state assignments are equally correct .",
    "the primary function of born probabilities is to offer a physically situated agent authoritative advice on how to apportion degrees of belief concerning contentful canonical magnitude claims that the agent is not currently in a position to check .",
    "that is why the born rule should be applied by differently situated agents to assign different chances to a single canonical magnitude claim @xmath126 about a system @xmath120 in a given situation .",
    "these different chance assignments will then be equally objective and equally correct .    the physical situation of a ( hypothetical or actual ) agent will change with ( local ) time .",
    "the agent may come to be in a position to check the truth - values of previously inaccessible magnitude claims , some of which may be taken truly to describe outcomes of measurements .",
    "if a quantum state is to continue to provide the agent with good guidance concerning still inaccessible magnitude claims , it must be updated to reflect these newly accessible truths .",
    "the required alteration in the quantum state is not a physical process involving the system , in conflict with schrdinger evolution .",
    "what has changed is just the physical relation of the agent to events whose occurrence is described by true magnitude claims .",
    "this is not represented by a discontinuous change in the quantum state of some model : it corresponds to adoption of a _ new _ quantum model that incorporates additional information , newly accessible to the user of quantum mechanics .",
    "the preceding paragraphs contained a lot of talk of agents . to forestall misunderstandings",
    ", i emphasize that quantum mechanics is not about agents or their states of knowledge or belief : a precise formulation of quantum mechanics will not speak of such things in its models any more than it will speak of agents measuring , observing or preparing activities .",
    "if quantum mechanics is about anything it is about the quantum systems , states , observables and probability measures that figure in its models .",
    "quantum mechanics , like all scientific theories , was developed by ( human ) agents for the use of agents ( not necessarily human : while insisting that any agent be physically situated , i direct further inquiry on the constitution of agents to cognitive scientists ) .",
    "trivially , only an agent can apply a theory for whatever purpose .",

    "_    i used the idea of intervention to argue against any causal dependence between events in @xmath62 and @xmath57 : anyone who accepts quantum mechanics accepts that it makes no sense to speak of an intervention in one of these regions that would affect a hypothetical agent s estimated chance of what happens in the other .",
    "so even though the outcome @xmath23 in @xmath162 backs the assignment @xmath149 to @xmath142 at @xmath69 , the outcome  in @xmath88 does not depend causally on @xmath23 : for similar reasons , neither does the outcome in @xmath57  depend on that in @xmath62 . the same idea can now be used to show that both these outcomes _ do _ depend causally on whatever event @xmath163 in the overlap of the backward light cones of @xmath62 and @xmath57  warranted assignment of state @xmath159an event truly described by magnitude claims that backed this assignment .",
    "assume first that the events @xmath15 at which the polarizers are set on a particular occasion occur in the overlap of the backward light cones of @xmath88 and @xmath57 : this assumption will later be dropped .",
    "let @xmath164 be a point outside the future light cones of @xmath165 but within the future light cone of the event @xmath163 .",
    "let @xmath166 be the event of the joint occurrence of  @xmath165 .",
    "this is an event of a type to which the born rule is applicable : the application yields its chance @xmath167 @xmath168 .",
    "we already saw that @xmath169 .",
    "the event @xmath163 affects all these chances : had a different event @xmath170 occurred backing the assignment of a different state ( e.g. @xmath171 ) , or no event backing any state assignment , then any or all of these chances could have been different . since it makes sense to speak of an agent altering the chance of event @xmath163 at @xmath120 in its past light cone , we have@xmath172where @xmath173 means @xmath163 is the result of an intervention without which @xmath163 would not have occurred .",
    "it follows that @xmath174 are each causally dependent on @xmath163 : @xmath163 is a common cause of @xmath165 even though the probabilities of events of these types do not factorize .",
    "the same reasoning applies to each registered photon pair on any occasion at any settings @xmath15 .",
    "so the second requirement on explanation is met : the separate recording events , as well as the event of their joint occurrence , depend _ causally _ on the event @xmath163 that serves to back assignment of state @xmath137 to the photon pairs involved in this scenario .    by rejecting any possibility of an intervention expressed by @xmath175 or @xmath176 , anyone accepting quantum mechanics should deny that @xmath177 is true or even meaningful .",
    "nevertheless @xmath178 : in this sense @xmath21 depends counterfactually but not causally on @xmath23 .",
    "does such counterfactual dependence provide reason enough to conclude that @xmath21 is part of the explanation of @xmath23 ?",
    "an obvious objection is that because of the symmetry of the situation with @xmath88 and @xmath57 space - like separated there is an equally strong reason to conclude that @xmath23 is part of the explanation of @xmath21 , contrary to the fundamentally asymmetric nature of the explanation relation .",
    "but one can see that this objection is not decisive by paying attention to the contrasting epistemic perspectives associated with the different physical situations of hypothetical agents alice * and bob * with world - lines confined to interiors of the light cones of @xmath62 , @xmath57 respectively .    as his world - line enters the future light cone of @xmath57 bob * comes into position to know the outcome at @xmath57 while still physically unable to observe the outcome at @xmath62 .",
    "his epistemic situation is then analogous to that  of a hypothetical agent chris in a world with a newtonian absolute time , in a position to know the outcome of past events but physically unable to observe any future event .",
    "many have been tempted to elevate the epistemic asymmetry of chris s situation into a global metaphysical asymmetry in which the future is open while the past is fixed and settled .",
    "it is then a short step to a metaphysical view of explanation as a productive relation in which the fixed past gives rise to the ( otherwise ) open future , either deterministically or stochastically .. ]    such a move from epistemology to metaphysics should always be treated with deep suspicion .",
    "but in this case it is clearly inappropriate in a relativistic space - time since the `` open futures '' of agents like alice * and bob * can not be unified into _ the _ open future .",
    "this prompts a retreat to a metaphysically drained view of explanation as rooted in cognitive concerns of a physically situated agent , motivated by the need to unify , extend and efficiently deploy the limited information to which it has access .    for many purposes it is appropriate to regard the entire scientific community as a ( spatially )",
    "distributed agent , and to think of the provision of scientific explanations as aiding _ our _ collective epistemic and practical goals .",
    "this is appropriate insofar as localized agents share an epistemic perspective , with access to the same information about what has happened . but",
    "alice * and bob * do not have access to the same information at time @xmath148 or @xmath179 since they are then space - like separated .",
    "so it is entirely appropriate for bob * to use @xmath23 to explain @xmath21 and for alice * to use @xmath21 to explain @xmath23 .",
    "this does not make explanation a subjective matter for two reasons .",
    "there is an objective physical difference between the situations of alice * and bob * underlying the asymmetry of their epistemic perspectives : and by adopting either perspective in thought ( as i have encouraged the reader to do ) anyone can come to appreciate how each explanation can help make bell s correlations seem less puzzling .",
    "admittedly , neither explanation is very deep , and i will end by noting one puzzle that remains .    by meeting both minimal requirements on explanation ,",
    "the application of quantum theory enables us to explain bell s correlations . but",
    "this explanation local ? several senses of locality are relevant here .",
    "he explanation involves no superluminal causal dependence .",
    "as stated , the condition of local causality is not applicable to the quantum mechanical explanation since it presupposes the uniqueness of the probability to which it refers .",
    "( [ factorizabilitysu ] ) ( and presumably also ( [ factorizability ] ) ) are violated , but bell ( [ 2004 , p. 243 ] ) preferred to see ( [ factorizability ] ) as not a formulation but a consequence of ` local causality ' : i have argued that it is not . to retain its connection to ( ip ) ,",
    "a version of local  causality should speak of chances rather than general probabilities . a version that equates the unconditional chance of @xmath21 to its chance conditional on @xmath23 holds , no matter how these chances are relativized to the same space - time point . but a version that is clearly motivated by the intuitive principle ( ip ) would rather equate the unconditional chance of @xmath21 to its chance conditional on _ an intervention that produces _ @xmath23 . however this version is inapplicable since acceptance of quantum mechanics renders senseless talk of interventions producing @xmath23 .",
    "the explanation one can give by applying quantum mechanics appeals to _ chances _ that are localized , insofar as they are assigned at space - time points that may be thought to offer the momentary perspective of a hypothetical idealized agent whose credences they would guide . but these chances are not quantum beables and they are not physical propensities capable of manifestation at those locations ( or anywhere else ) .",
    "the only causes figuring in the explanation are localized where the physical systems are whose magnitudes back the assignment of state @xmath137 . that chances are not propensities becomes clear when one drops the assumption that @xmath15 occur in the overlap of the backward light cones of @xmath62 and @xmath85 , as depicted in figure 5 .",
    "if @xmath15 are set at the last moment , the chance of @xmath166 that figures in its explanation may be located _",
    "later _ in the laboratory frame than @xmath165 . if chance were a physical propensity it should act _ before _ its manifestation .",
    "but chances are nt _ _  _ _ propensities  proximate causes of localized events .",
    "they are a localized agent s objective guide to credence about epistemically inaccessible events .",
    "i will conclude by noting one sense in which the explanation one  can give using quantum mechanics is not local as it stands .",
    "though it is a ( non - factorizable ) cause of  events of types @xmath145 in regions @xmath180 @xmath57 respectively , the event @xmath163 is not connected to its effects by any spatiotemporally continuous causal process described by quantum mechanics .",
    "this puts the explanation in tension with the _ _",
    "first _ _ conjunct of bell s ( [ 2004 , p. 239 ] ) intuitive locality principle ( ip):_\"the direct causes ( and effects ) of events are near by _ , and even the indirect causes ( and effects ) are no further away than permitted by the velocity of light . \"",
    "@xmath163 is separated from both recording events in regions @xmath180 @xmath85 in time , and from at least one in space . if @xmath163 is not merely a cause but a _ direct _ cause of these events then it violates the first conjunct of ( ip ) because it is _ not _ nearby .",
    "but if one adopts the present view of quantum mechanics , the theory has no resources to describe any causes mediating between @xmath163 and these recording events .",
    "so while their quantum explanation is not explicitly inconsistent with the first conjunct of ( ip ) , mediating causes could be found only by constructing a new theory .",
