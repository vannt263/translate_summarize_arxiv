    "after nearly thirty years since the discovery of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , a fading afterglow has been detected in x - ray and optical wave - bands ( van paradijs et al .",
    "this observational breakthrough has , for the first time , provided both a precise localisation of a grb position and broad - band spectral information .",
    "but , while the spectral fit by wijers , rees & mszros ( 1997 ) does agree quite well with the cosmological blastwave theory ( rees & mszros 1992 ) , a coherent picture of the distance scale to grbs has yet to emerge .",
    "preliminary results as to the nature of the observed field surrounding the optical transient position have been inconclusive : a faint extended source near the optical transient position may have faded from images taken at keck at two different epochs ( metzger et al .",
    "1997a ; although see fox et al .",
    "the natural assumption was that if grbs are cosmological in origin then the optical transient would be associated with a galaxy ; if the extension is indeed variable , then this is not the case .",
    "furthermore , a spectrum of the optical transient and the extension taken with the keck ii telescope ( tonry et al .",
    "1997 ) does not reveal any tell - tale features which would indicate the distance to grb 970228 .",
    "so far no extended emission has been detected from the recent burst grb 970508 but metzger et al .",
    "( 1997b ) have reported absorption lines in the spectra of the optical transient putting the transient beyond @xmath3 .",
    "if confirmed , this would establish grbs as cosmological .",
    "if grbs are cosmological , what are the other likely observational consequences which would rule out the non - cosmological scenarios ?",
    "one answer is that in most cosmological models grbs will have a parent galaxy which we can search for .",
    "historically this has been difficult due to the scarcity of small error boxes : the interplanetary network ( ipn ) of satellites yielded only a few error boxes smaller then about @xmath4 arcmin@xmath5 ( atteia et al .",
    "1987 ) . as the projected density of galaxies is reasonably high ( eg .",
    "we expect about @xmath6 galaxies in 5 arcmin@xmath5 boxes at @xmath7 ) there was no lack of potential hosts galaxies to the bursts ; statistical studies of grb positions were thereby limited to searching for correlations on scale lengths greater than several arcmins ( kolatt & piran 1996 ; hurley et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "kolatt & piran 1996 , for instance , do find evidence of a correlation of bursts with abell clusters using the crude batse localisations ( although see hurley et al .",
    "1997 ) . using the better , but fewer , localisations from the ipn , there have also been claims of a bright galaxy excess near bright bursts ( larson , mclean , & becklin 1996 ) but this analysis uses poissonian errors to quantify over - density , neglecting the fact that galaxies are clustered and counts far galaxies outside the strict limits of the ipn error boxes .",
    "fenimore et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , examining 8 of the smallest ipn error boxes , conclude that host galaxies of grbs must be fainter than an absolute visual magnitude @xmath8 .",
    "_ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "observations of ipn boxes confirm this result ( schaefer et al .",
    "1997 ) and further constrain the host galaxies of grbs to be fainter than absolute @xmath9 .",
    "the conclusion that this requires the hosts of grbs to be significantly fainter than @xmath10 is valid only if grbs are standard candles and if the faintest batse bursts have @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , it does not allow for the possibility that a galaxy outside ipn error boxes could be the host to the grbs",
    ".    with the detection of the optical transient to grb 970228 we now have the beginning of a set of very high precision positions and correlation analysis should thus begin to probe smaller scales at deeper magnitudes .",
    "deep hst imaging reveals faint extended emission adjacent to the 970228 optical transient point source .",
    "if further observations prove that this is a distant galaxy , then it must be a very good candidate for the host of the grb .",
    "however , at a magnitude of @xmath12 ( tanvir & johnson 1997 ) the spatial density of galaxies is high and the alignment could be a chance coincidence .",
    "thus galactic models are not ruled out and neither are cosmological models in which the progenitors of grbs are ejected from their host or even only be loosely associated with the light density from galaxies . if grbs arise from neutron star  neutron star ( ns  ns ) coalescence , for instance , then a grb may occur tens of kpc outside of its host galaxy ( sigurdsson , private communication ) ; at redshifts of @xmath13 , such positional displacements allow an offset of the optical transient from its host galaxy by as much as 20 arcsec .",
    "if grbs do occur far outside their hosts then unambiguously identifying the parent galaxies will be difficult .",
    "however , to rule out the galactic scenario , it would suffice to find a statistically significant over - density of potential host galaxies near grb positions since bursts originating from within our galaxy should be randomly distributed with respect to underlying galaxy field .    clearly , to distinguish between the two distance scales , there must be a method which can both determine an over - density of potential hosts ( if there is one ) and accurately estimate the significance of such an over - density .",
    "ultimately , if the distance scale to grbs is established to be cosmological , then the same analysis will help reveal how grbs are distributed near galaxies .",
    "in section 2 we provide a framework for making quantifiable statistical statements about the degree of over - density of hosts for a given number of grb positions that accounts for galaxy clustering . in section 3",
    "we describe the simulation of a galaxy distribution which is used in section 4 to predict the number of grb positions needed to find a significant correlation if grbs are indeed associated with distant galaxies . in section 5",
    "we show how the method developed herein may be extended to other types of data and hypotheses .",
    "in other words , should observations provide no evidence for a positive correlation , the test developed in section 2 can be used to accept the alternative hypothesis that grbs _ are not _ correlated with potential hosts to faint limits ( obviously , by rejection of the null hypothesis that there _ is _ a correlation under some given set of assumptions ) .",
    "we consider this issue in light of results from hst images of grb 970228 .",
    "in an overwhelming number of viable cosmological models , a grb originates from near or within a galaxy . in each model scenario , there is a three - dimensional probability , @xmath14 , of a grb originating from a given galaxy at a co - moving position , @xmath15 , relative to its centre . in the simplest case ,",
    "we take the probability of a grb occurring to be constant within a sphere of radius @xmath16 .",
    "the projected two - dimensional probability distribution on the sky , for a galaxy at redshift @xmath17 is thus : @xmath18 where @xmath19}~{\\rm radians}\\ ] ] in the standard , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , cosmology .",
    "hereafter , the hubble constant is taken as @xmath22 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 ( eg .  tanvir et al .",
    "1995 ) . for each burst , @xmath24",
    ", there is a total probability normalisation , @xmath25 , for each galaxy in the field . if the results of the log @xmath26-log @xmath27 studies are to be used as a guideline ( as in fenimore et al .",
    "1993 ) , then a bright grb  such as the expected case for most bepposax x - ray detections or small ipn error box localisations  is expected to come from a low - redshift galaxy and thus @xmath25 for that particular burst will peak at a low redshift .    for each burst position @xmath24 ( which is observed in a given passband , and limiting magnitude )",
    "one constructs a probability host map , phm@xmath28 , by adding the contribution of @xmath29 from each galaxy where @xmath30 is the maximum offset scale of the map .",
    "a phm gives the relative probability of a grb occurring at any position on the sky assuming a particular functional form of the offset probability , @xmath31 .",
    "if grbs are not correlated with galaxies then their positions should occur randomly on the phm ; conversely , if grbs are correlated with galaxies then their positions will arise in regions of larger probability density on the phm .    since we do not know _ a priori _ both the intrinsic offset scale @xmath16 and the functional form of the offset probability distribution , we must assume some map scale @xmath30 and a form of the offset probability distribution [ @xmath31 ] .",
    "in addition , construction of the phm requires knowledge of the redshift of each galaxy ; redshifts may be determined from photometric colours , via their observed spectra , or simply estimated from their brightness using previous flux / redshift studies .",
    "alternatively , a median redshift of galaxies in the field may be assigned to each galaxy . in the simulations in section 3 ,",
    "we show that , not surprisingly , a phm is most sensitive to detecting correlations if @xmath33 .",
    "we also find that assigning the median redshift to each galaxy in the map suffices in finding correlations ( see fig .",
    "[ [ fig : pred1 ] ] ) at least for small intrinsic offset scales .",
    "note that if the map scale @xmath30 is sufficiently small ( i.e.  if grbs are retained within a few kpc of a host galaxy ) , the phm reduces to a series of @xmath34-functions . in section 6",
    "we discuss what a reasonable value for @xmath16 might be for different models .",
    "in what follows , let @xmath35 be the value of phm@xmath36 for the @xmath37th randomly selected location on map @xmath24 ; by counting the frequency of @xmath35 for a large number of randomly selected points we construct the distribution @xmath38 , which is effectively the probability of finding @xmath39 of a potential host on the sky at any point on the map .      for a given passband and limiting magnitude of an observation of each position , there will be a corresponding number density , @xmath40 , and two - point correlation function , @xmath41 , that characterises the underlying distribution of galaxies from which @xmath38 is found . in section 3",
    "we simulate an underlying galaxy distribution that matches the observed properties . in practice",
    ", it may be better to estimate @xmath38 directly from a number of control fields taken at similar airmass , galactic latitude , limiting magnitude , etc .",
    "the normalised cumulative probability function is given as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the extreme values of @xmath39 on a given phm@xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath46 is the observed value of @xmath39 on the phm of burst @xmath24 then the set of numbers @xmath47 will be evenly distributed in the interval [ 0,1 ] if the positions of the grb ensemble are uncorrelated with that of the potential host galaxy distribution .",
    "the degree of deviation of @xmath48 from an evenly distributed , cumulative set can be used to estimate the strength of the correlation between grbs and observed potential host galaxies .",
    "thus , this method allows one to combine an inhomogeneous set of observations to test the hypothesis that grbs are correlated with host galaxies .",
    "the significance of the discrepancy between the observed set @xmath48 and the expected set is evaluated using the wilcoxon statistic ( see noether 1967 and efron & petrosian 1996 ) . it is defined as : @xmath49 ,   \\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] and compares the average value of @xmath48 and the expected value of the cumulative probability distribution ( @xmath50 ) . _",
    "the distribution of @xmath51 values , @xmath52 , for an uncorrelated set of grb positions and potential hosts should be normally distributed with variance unity centred about zero . _ in section 3 we construct @xmath52 for a given limiting magnitude and number of optical transient source positions by a monte carlo simulation of many expected ( uncorrelated ) sets ( see fig .",
    "[ [ fig : w ] ] ) .",
    "we test the null hypothesis that grb optical transient source positions are uncorrelated with host galaxies by comparing the stochastic realization of @xmath53 with the expected distribution of @xmath52",
    ". clearly if there is a positive correlation , then the @xmath51-statistic will be negative ( and the opposite is true for a anti - correlation ) . in this formalism",
    ", the null hypothesis can be rejected with a quantifiable confidence level by comparison of @xmath53 with @xmath52 .",
    "in this section we construct simulations which will be used to assess the power of the above analysis under different assumptions about the true grb distribution .",
    "specifically we will use these simulations to ask how many observations would be required to show some correlation of grbs with galaxies in various scenarios .      to estimate the expected significances",
    ", we construct a galaxy distribution which artificially replicates the observed galaxy number density , two - point correlation function , and redshift distribution for a given limiting magnitude .",
    "several galaxy distribution studies have provided the necessary data to construct such a distribution but here we limit ourselves to the correlation / redshift study of roche et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . for a given limiting magnitude @xmath54 in the r- and b - band",
    ", they provide a redshift distribution of galaxies ( @xmath55 ) , number density ( @xmath56 ) , and fit to a two - point correlation function ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the observations were made at high galactic latitude ( @xmath58 ) and with little extinction ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "this simulation is obviously extendible using other galaxy distribution studies which provide similar data in other passbands and/or limiting magnitudes .      as mentioned earlier",
    ", it may be possible to construct a phm directly from control fields taken under similar conditions as the optical transient field . here",
    ", however , we generate a phm artificially . to generate an artificial galaxy distribution",
    ", we employ the truncated hierarchy method ( soneria & peebles 1978 ) which has been adapted to 2-d projections ( infante 1994 ) . for a given burst position @xmath24 we vary the intrinsic scaling @xmath61 of the algorithm (",
    "see infante 1994 ) to fit the expected spatial distribution of underlying galaxies ( quantified by the spatial density distribution , @xmath40 and the amplitude and slope , @xmath62 , of the two - point correlation function ) . for each galaxy in the distribution",
    ", we construct a probability profile from eq .",
    "[ [ eq : prob2d ] ] replacing @xmath16 with @xmath30 and thereby construct a phm@xmath63 .",
    "a b c    the construction of the galaxy distribution and phm requires a few assumptions .    1 .",
    "we take the slope of the two - point correlation function to be @xmath64 which , based on numerous galaxy distribution studies ( eg .  roche et al .",
    "1996 ) , seems reasonable . in our simulation using the truncated hierarchy method , for @xmath2 , we are able to reproduce the two - point correlation function and number density ( @xmath65 gals / deg@xmath5 ) that match that found in roche et al .  1996 .",
    "bright grbs are expected to come from moderate redshifts .",
    "we have therefore chosen a limiting magnitude of @xmath2 which corresponds to a median redshift of @xmath66 .",
    "clearly the analysis may be extended to fainter magnitudes in which case the expected number of burst positions required to find a correlation will increase .",
    "we assign a redshift to each galaxy in the generated distribution .",
    "roche et al .",
    "( 1996 ) provide an estimated galaxy redshift distribution as a function of limiting magnitude .",
    "for each cluster in an artificially generated spatial distribution , we then assign a similar redshift ( @xmath67 percent ) to its constituent galaxies based on a probability distribution constructed from the roche et al .",
    "( 1996 ) data .",
    "this accounts for both for the observed distribution of redshifts and the fact that galaxies within the same cluster have similar redshifts .",
    "we take @xmath25 equal to unity .",
    "note that _ any _ non - uniform dependency of @xmath25 upon redshift will reduce the spatial density of potential hosts and thus increase the detectability of a correlation .",
    "although the distances to grb hosts should be in accord with distance implied by the log @xmath26-log @xmath27 , it is not clear that the log @xmath26-log @xmath27 gives a meaningful constraint on the functional form of @xmath25 since a standard luminosity of grbs appears to be unconstrained ( loredo & wasserman 1996 ; horvath , mszros , & mszros 1996 ) .",

    "this is not a surprising result given that the typical projected distance at @xmath73 for @xmath74 kpc is only a few arcsec : the expected value of phm@xmath75 is close to zero and thus any over - density is rare .",

    "small values of @xmath30 produce phms that are most sensitive to a correlation if @xmath16 is also small ; likewise , correlations are most readily found if @xmath16 is large by a choice of a large value of @xmath30 in making the map . as evidenced by the small number of bursts required to make a significant correlation",

    "it should be emphasised that the `` no - host '' conclusion of schaefer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and fenimore et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is based strongly on the assumption that the grb population follows a non - evolving , standard candle luminosity in as much as it is argued that bright bursts should come from nearby galaxies .",
    "but from an observational standpoint , loredo & wasserman ( 1996 ) have concluded that the width of the luminosity function of grbs is poorly constrained and horvath , mszros , & mszros ( 1996 ) find that a large range of luminosities acceptably fit the log @xmath26-log @xmath27 distribution .",
    "moreover , theories of cosmological shocks and blastwaves predict a grb luminosity which can vary greatly from burst to burst ( eg .  fenimore , madras , & nayakskin 1996 ) ; instead total energy is more likely to be standard ( see bloom , fenimore , & in t zand 1997 ) .",
    "thus , robust conclusions about ( non-)correlations of hosts with grbs should not rely on the above assumptions .",
    "the specific correlation hypothesis that is tested is wholly determined by the functional form and dependences in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : prob2d ] ] .",
    "the basic hypothesis we have tested in these simulations is that `` the progenitors of grbs originate ( and are possibly ejected ) from observable galaxies . ''",
    "if mass in the universe scales with light , this can also be seen as a test that the rate density of grbs is highest at the peaks of the matter distribution .",
    "of course while this hypothesis is somewhat model dependent , it effectively introduces only one free parameter , namely @xmath16 ( and to a lesser extent @xmath98 ) .",
    "we conservatively estimate the maximum intrinsic offset scale to be of order @xmath99 kpc .",
    "this corresponds to a constant progenitor outward velocity @xmath100 km / s and a collision time scale of @xmath101 years .",
    "if all grbs occur at such large distances from their host galaxy , it would be difficult to find a significant correlation with a small collection of grb positions .",
    "however , simulations have shown for ns - ns models that @xmath16 may be an order of magnitude smaller and @xmath102 is likely to be very peaked near the centre for most galaxies , so that the effective @xmath16 might be significantly lower than 400 kpc ( lipunov et al .",
    "1995 ) . therefore ,",
    "whatever the true @xmath16 is , we believe that the assumed @xmath103 , is quite conservative by over - predicting the true extension of grbs from their hosts .    since @xmath16 is not known it is impossible to know _ a priori _ which map scale @xmath30 will optimise the detection of a correlation .",
    "the predictions of a 95 percent confident correlation after about six optical transient detections is based on a fixed @xmath104 kpc and assuming @xmath105 kpc ( see fig .  [ 4 ] ) .",
    "although a detected correlation thusly will be adequate for resolving the distance scale to grbs debate , ideally one would like to determine @xmath16 in addition . as a correlation search over a range of map scales",
    "@xmath30 is likely to increase the random chance of finding a correlation , it will be necessary to determine @xmath16 _ a posteriori _ via bayesian analysis .",

    "we have presented a formalism which may be used to quantify the degree of over - density of potential host galaxies near grb positions ; if grbs are found to be cosmological in origin this formalism may also be used to determine the intrinsic offset of grbs from their hosts .",

    "<S> while the optical transient of grb 970228 may be close to a faint galaxy , there are several other galaxies in the field which could be the host if the progenitors are ejected to @xmath0 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> if grbs come from such a widely distributed progenitor population then it should be possible to search for a statistical correlation between optical transients and nearby galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a statistical framework for quantifying a correlation between potential host galaxies and grbs , taking into account that galaxies are clustered . from simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate that if grbs occur within @xmath1 kpc of their host , then optical observations ( @xmath2 ) of the galaxy field near just 6 optical transient positions are required to find a correlation with potential hosts at the 95 percent confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> the methodology constructed herein is extendible to any cross - correlation analysis and is especially useful if either set of objects is clustered . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , if the distance scale to grbs is established as cosmological , this analysis can be used to determine the spatial distribution of grbs near their host galaxies .    </S>",
