    "there has been an increasing interest in the few last years in the _ sign problem _ or _ phase problem _ in qcd . for finite chemical potential ,",
    "the fermion determinant matrix is non - positive definite , so it is not possible to perform monte - carlo simulations @xcite . the glasgow method @xcite and rewheighting techniques @xcite have made great advances in the description of phase transitions on the lattice , considering a set of parameters near the transition line .",
    "however , the problem is still far from being solved .    there is special interest in the region of high temperature and low chemical potential , since it corresponds to the high - energy heavy - ion collision scenario . in this regime",
    "it is possible to expand the fermion determinant in powers of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this kind of expansion is what we are interested in investigating .",
    "as one performs this expansion , some questions arrise : what order is enough to cut the expansion ? which is its range of validity ? how to distinguish between real and complex terms ?",
    "differently from what is done in the previously mentioned papers , we keep the expanded series as a functional of the gauge fields , giving rise to an effective non - local yang - mills action .",
    "for simplicity , consider one - flavor massless quarks .",
    "the qcd generating functional at finite chemical potential in euclidean space is defined as @xmath1},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 are the gluon fields , also present in the covariant derivative @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the yang - mills action .",
    "we can expand the fermion determinant in powers of the chemical potential assuming that @xmath5 :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the dressed fermion propagator , which can be expressed as a series in powers of the gauge field and the free fermion propagator .",
    "the expansion , then , will contribute to additional terms in the yang - mills effective action @xmath8 where the vertices @xmath9 are series in powers of the chemical potential : @xmath10 , with @xmath11 . in this way we have a positive - definite fermion determinant and",
    "the contribution from the chemical potential will be part of an effective yang - mills action .",
    "the problem now is to find criteria to cut this infinite series in terms of the chemical potential and gauge fields .",
    "to test the expansion , we study it firstly in the perturbative sector . setting @xmath12 ,",
    "we find naturally the way to cut the gauge field series , which is given by the order of perturbative corrections . for one - loop corrections ,",
    "we just need the effective action up to order @xmath13 , so @xmath14 we calculate , then , the pressure up to order @xmath13 . considering the expansion on chemical potential up to order @xmath15 ,",
    "we surprisingly obtain the same result as in the usual pertubative qcd calculation with the chemical potential included in the quark propagator @xcite .    however , the next terms in the chemical potential series are non - zero . in particular , the next vacuum contribution for the pressure is @xmath16 which is negligible only for @xmath17 .",
    "more than establishing the range of validity , this result shows that this kind of expansion contains some spurious information , at least for the massless case , and in principle the only indication on where to cut the series is the dimension of the desired observable .",
    "for the non - perturbative regime , we need another criterium to cut the series .",
    "the most appropriate is the weinberg power counting @xcite , i.e. considering the external momentum as a small parameter , @xmath18 , and also assuming that the chemical potential and the expectation value of the fields are of the same order , @xmath19 .",
    "this gives a low - energy theory where the effective lagrangian can be expanded in soft modes . in the case of yang - mills theories ,",
    "this soft - mode expansions for high temperatures correspond to the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the minimal action must be of order @xmath20 .",
    "so , applying the power counting , the minimal effective action is @xmath21 = s_{{\\mbox{\\tiny{ym}}}}[g ] + s^{(0,2)}(\\mu ) + s^{(0,4)}(\\mu ) + s_{{\\mbox{\\tiny{lo}}}}^{(2,2)}[g,\\mu]+ s_{{\\mbox{\\tiny{lo}}}}^{(3,1)}[g,\\mu]~,\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath22 denote powers of @xmath23 in the gauge field and @xmath24 in the chemical potential , and lo means leading order in the htl approximation . in this case",
    ", the appearance of imaginary terms will happen for @xmath25 .",
    "the whole series of gauge fields is gauge invariant in every order in the @xmath26 expansion , i.e. @xmath27 is gauge invariant for all @xmath24 . in the case of the minimal effective action , the contributions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are independently gauge invariant , and htl preserves this feature",
    ".    of course this effective action must be tested , but in principle it could provide rich information on the confinement - deconfinement transition line .",
