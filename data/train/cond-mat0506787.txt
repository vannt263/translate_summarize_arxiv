    "the hamiltonian of the model in @xcite includes the lennard - jones potential serving as the gaussian energy for the hpk model .",
    "the bending energy in @xcite is very similar to the one for the hpk model .",
    "these numerical results , therefore , strongly suggest that the hpk model undergoes a discontinuous transition .",
    "however , little attention has been given to whether a discontinuous transition is observed in the tethered surface model of hpk , whose hamiltonian includes the bending energy of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the unit normal vector for the triangle @xmath11 .",
    "we will call this form of energy as the ordinary bending energy from now on .",
    "therefore , in order to confirm that the phase transition of the hpk model is of the first order , we need to study further the tethered surface model defined by the ordinary bending energy .    in this paper , we numerically study the tethered model on a sphere , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath2 is the gaussian energy and @xmath3 is the ordinary bending energy described above .",
