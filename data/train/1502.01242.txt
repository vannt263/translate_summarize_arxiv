    "recently , a number of observations of globular clusters ( gcs ) suggested that their cores may contain much more mass then expected from earlier observations @xcite .",
    "as proposed by several authors , these mass excesses can be ascribed to the presence of an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) or a very massive star ( vms ) close to the cluster centre , with masses in the range @xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "for instance , observations and modelling of the innermost region of m15 seem to be consistent with the presence of a single object @xcite .",
    "furthermore , hints for imbhs candidates have been found also in other gcs in the milky way @xcite , and in other galaxies ( see for example @xcite ) , as in the case of g1 in m31 @xcite , and the young massive cluster in the m82 irregular galaxy @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed for the birth and growth of imbhs .",
    "for instance , @xcite pointed out that a stellar bh seed may grow slowly through occasional collisions and merging with other stars .",
    "another possibility relies upon the mass segregation process , driven mainly by dynamical friction ( df ) , which leads to an accumulation of mass within the cluster centre in form of orbitally decayed stars .",
    "in such a case , the most massive stars tend to concentrate toward the centre of the cluster , while the lighter component moves outward in an attempt to establish energy equipartition . as the mass segregation proceeds , the heaviest stars lose kinetic energy and reach the innermost region of the cluster , where they form a dense , contracting nucleus @xcite .    in this framework , some authors suggested that the shrinking nucleus collapses in a fraction of the relaxation time - scale @xcite .",
    "the collapse facilitates a phase of runaway collisions among stars that leads to the formation of an imbh @xcite , whose gravitational field can significantly shape the dynamical evolution of the host cluster @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the observational evidence of a compact object in the centre of gcs can be interpreted as a dense , massive sub - system composed of dark remnants of heavy stars @xcite . in this case , the formation of binaries efficiently halts the contraction of the nucleus , preventing the formation of a vms ( or an imbh ) .",
    "the evolution of the resulting sub - system of stars , which we refer to as mss , will be likely dominated by two and three - body interactions @xcite .",
    "a great effort toward the understanding of imbhs formation and growth will likely come from the next generation of space - based gravitational waves ( gws ) observatories , as the elisa satellite @xcite but , currently , it is quite hard to discriminate between an imbh and an mss through observations .    in this paper , we investigate how the global properties of the host cluster affect the formation process of an mss . using a treatment for the dynamical friction process recently developed by @xcite",
    ", we studied mass segregation in 168 models of gcs with different total masses , density distributions , initial mass functions ( imfs ) and metallicities .",
    "our results suggest that the kind of stars which populate the mss depends on the imf and metallicity of the host cluster , while spatial distribution and stellar evolution affect significantly the mss mass .",
    "furthermore , we provide relations connecting the mss mass with the total mass of the host cluster , showing that the best agreement with observations is achieved for power - law imfs .    to follow the mss formation process in detail , we performed direct @xmath0-body simulations of several gcs with masses in the range @xmath5 m@xmath4 .",
    "the time - scale needed to assembly an mss , as well as the mss mass and size , agrees with our semi - analytical results .    in section [ meth ] the methodology used to derive mss masses",
    "is introduced and discussed , in section [ res ] we investigate the properties of msss and provide scaling relations connecting the mass of msss and the host cluster , in section [ nbody ] we discuss the direct @xmath0-body simulations performed whereas in section [ end ] we draw the conclusions of this work .",
    "as database to compare with our theoretical results , we used observational data provided by @xcite ( hereafter lu13 ) , although some works seem to be at odds with them ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we will discuss the implications of different observational mass estimates on our results in the next section .",

    "direct @xmath0-body simulations are powerful tools to follow the mass segregation of stars in stellar clusters , since in this case df comes out naturally as a consequence of the two - body interactions . on the other hand , the presence of a softening length that smooths the gravitational interaction may lead to less efficient energy exchanges among particles , altering in some cases the orbital decay process . due to this reason",
    ", we ran several test simulations of the same model at decreasing values of @xmath7 .",
    "we find that the orbital evolution of the most massive stars is substantially unaltered when @xmath8 pc .",
    "hence , to obtain a good compromise between the computational cost and the accuracy of the simulations , we set this limiting value as softening length",
    ".    an accurate @xmath0-body modelling of the cluster would allow to get the dynamical friction time - scale of stars .",
    "hence , we tested the validity of our treatment for df comparing the theoretical estimates of @xmath9 with the values obtained directly from the simulations .",
    "in particular , we selected in simulation ` 262k_sey_d_s ` those stars for which the orbital decay occurs over a time sufficiently greater than the time resolution of the simulation itself .",
    "this requirement is crucial in order to extrapolate the decay time of a stars in the @xmath0-body model . having detailed informations about the orbital evolution of these stars",
    ", we evaluated their df times , @xmath10 , comparing them with the theoretical estimates obtained through equation [ eq2cor ] .",
    "in particular , figure [ traj ] shows the relative difference , @xmath11 , between the @xmath0-body and the theoretical time - scale provided by equation [ eq2cor ] : @xmath12    the maximum difference @xmath11 between semi - analytic treatment and n - body simulations is @xmath13 .",
    "extrapolating the orbital parameters of stars is the main source of uncertainty for @xmath10 , due to the fact that our simulations have a poor time - resolution .",
    "the good agreement between the semi - analytical estimates and the simulations suggest that equation [ eq2cor ] can be used to reproduce reliable sets of initial conditions for the cluster immediately after the completion of the mass segregation process , thus allowing to simulate only the subsequent evolution of the cluster .",
    "it should be noted that a detailed simulation of the mass segregation process for a reliable cluster model with a mass above @xmath14 m@xmath4 may require more than a month to be performed , even using the most advanced direct @xmath0-body codes and hardware facilities currently available .",
    "hence , our approach can allow to gain a significant amount of time for simulating the gc evolution .",
    ", as a function of the star masses , between the df time - scale evaluated through equation [ tdf ] and through the @xmath0-body simulation in the case of model ` 262k_sey_d_s`.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    as the mass segregation proceeds , heavy stars concentrate toward the innermost region of the host cluster , leading to a progressive increase of the density , which in turn enhances the probability to have close encounters among stars .    in higpus and higpusse , gravitational encounters are smoothed through the gravitational softening @xmath7 .",
    "hence , we stopped our simulations when the lagrangian radius which contains @xmath15 of the total mass of the cluster became comparable to @xmath7 , in order to reproduce in the most reliable way the early evolution of the host nucleus .",
    "for instance , looking at the time evolution of lagrangian radii shown in figure [ lagr ] makes evident that the innermost lagrangian radius reaches a size comparable to the softening in @xmath16 myr for simulation ` 262k_sen_d_s ` and @xmath17 myr for simulation ` 524k_sen_d_k ` .",
    "+   +      in this section we try to determine if stellar evolution can affect significantly the formation of an mss . in order to do this",
    ", we will compare the simulations performed with higpus with those obtained with its modified version , higpusse . on the other hand",
    ", it should be stressed that at the time , nor higpus neither higpusse include any treatment for close interactions and do not account for nss natal kicks .",
    "hence , we limit our comparison to the time interval over which the mss forms and without considering dynamical kicks suffered by nss at their birth .    figure [ mcent ] shows the mass enclosed within @xmath18 for all the simulations performed , @xmath19 . in particular , we compared in each panel simulations performed with higpus ( labelled with sen ) , in which stellar evolution is evaluated `` a posteriori '' with respect to the dynamical evolution of the cluster , and those performed through higpusse ( labelled with sey ) , in which stellar evolution is accounted along with the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "our estimate of the length scale of the host cluster is affected by a @xmath20 uncertainty , leading to a corresponding uncertainty on the value of @xmath18 ( see equations [ r_st ] and [ r_st2 ] ) .",
    "as expected , the mass of msss in simulations labelled with sen is slightly higher than in simulations denoted with sey , since in the latter case mass lost by each star decreases the df efficiency , thus increasing its orbital decay time - scale . on the other hand ,",
    "it is quite evident that the mass estimates provided using both higpus and higpusse are comparable within the error . hence , stellar evolution seems to not affect significantly the early phase of formation of msss .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that the scaling relations provided in section [ scor ] allow to evaluate mss masses that differ few percent from those evaluated through the @xmath0-body simulations .    in the next section",
    ", we will focus the attention on the formation of an mss in models composed of 262k and 524k particles simulated through higpus , which allows a much faster integration with respect to higpusse .",
    "+   +      in configuration ` 262k_sen_d_s ` the orbital decay of the heaviest stars leads to the formation of a dense sub - system , mss , with a half - mass radius of @xmath21 pc , which extends up to @xmath22 pc .",
    "as shown in figure [ light ] , the fraction of stars with initial masses below @xmath23 m@xmath4 that move within @xmath18 rapidly decreases in time both in simulations ` 262k_sen_d_s ` and ` 524k_sen_d_k ` , leading to the formation of an mss mainly composed of heavy stars .    in particular , model ` 262k_sen_d_s ` contains a population of @xmath24 stars with masses above @xmath23 m@xmath4 , for a total mass of @xmath25 m@xmath4 , that drives the formation of an mss over a time - scale of @xmath26 myr .",
    "figure [ fn4nb ] shows the distribution of stellar types within the mss in this case assuming an age of @xmath27 gyr , in order to compare this results with the semi - analytical results discussed in the previous section .",
    "the mss composition is really similar to the theoretical results shown in figure [ fn4 ] , with a dominant fraction of nss and bhs and a small percentage of ms stars and wds .",
    "m@xmath4 which move within the size of the mss , as a function of the time , in models ` 262k_sen_d_s ` ( solid line ) and ` 524k_sen_d_k ` ( dotted line ) . in both the simulations",
    "the whole population of light stars is pulled out from the mss.,width=302 ]    during the mss assembly , heavy stars transfer energy to lighter particles , which move outward , leading the total energy of the mss to decrease reaching negative values over a time @xmath28 myr . during this process , the mss contracts continuously , the most massive stars form the innermost core of the mss while lighter stars move outward . due to this ,",
    "the long - term evolution of the mss depend only on the gravitational encounters among the most massive stars , which may halt the mss contraction through the formation of binary systems and close encounters .    on the other hand",
    ", it has been widely shown that close encounters and binaries should not affect significantly the global properties of the mss @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that strong interactions among binaries and single stars should not alter significantly the fraction of stellar bhs .",
    "the energy provided by the binary hardening leads the cluster to expand by a factor of @xmath29 , depending on the metallicity of the host @xcite . using equations",
    "[ r_st ] and [ r_st2 ] , and accounting for this expansion the values of @xmath18 presented above still agrees with observational estimates @xcite .",
    "assuming for this model a value of the metallicity @xmath30 , we found from the @xmath0-body simulation that the newly born mss should have a mass @xmath31 m@xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "making use of the scaling relations provided above for a similar model , we found @xmath32 m@xmath4 , a value compatible with the one obtained through the @xmath0-body simulation .    the formation process of an mss can be argued also looking at the evolution of the host cluster s structure . for instance",
    ", we found that its surface density profile @xmath33 , with @xmath34 pc the projected distance to the cluster centre , gets steeper as the mss formation proceeds , and the slope passes from @xmath35 to @xmath36 by the end of the simulation .",
    "moreover , we found an increasing slope in the projected velocity dispersion , @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , we found that @xmath38 passes from a nearly @xmath39 value to @xmath40 within @xmath34 pc .",
    "this findings agree with observations , since the observed mass excesses are often associated to power - law surface density profiles or projected velocity dispersions within the inner region of the host clusters @xcite .    regarding configuration ` 524k_sen_d_k",
    "` , instead , the population of stars heavier than @xmath23 m@xmath4 has an initial mass of @xmath41 m@xmath4 and is composed of @xmath42 particles .    in this case ,",
    "mass segregation process is slower than in the previous model , as expected by equation [ eq2 ] ( see figure [ lagr ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the stellar mass loss time - scale in model ` 524k_sen_d_k ` is smaller than the segregation time - scale . due to this , stars will reach the gc centre after they have lost most of their initial mass and , therefore , the subsequent evolution of the mss will be substantially dominated by binary formation and close encounters .",
    "the concentration of the stars leads to an mss with a half - mass radius @xmath22 pc , slightly larger than in the case ` 262k_sen_d_s ` .",
    "it is worth noting that , even in this case , the mss size estimates provided in section [ promss ] are comparable to the size achieved through the @xmath0-body representation .    as in model ` 262k_sen_d_s ` , the fraction of stars with initial masses below @xmath23 m@xmath4 approaches a value close to @xmath39 within the simulated time , leaving an mss composed only of the most massive stars .",
    "for this model , assuming a metallicity @xmath30 , we found that the mss should have a mass @xmath43 m@xmath4 , a value @xmath44 smaller than the value estimated through the scaling relations provided above .",
    "in this paper we investigated how the global properties of star clusters can affect the formation process , in their centres , of massive sub - systems ( msss ) , using a semi - analytical method and a series of direct @xmath0-body simulations .    despite the methodology used here",
    "do not account for the effects related to the formation of binary and multiple systems , which may alter significantly the dynamics of stars in the cluster , it should noted that only hard binaries composed of compact objects ( stellar bhs or nss ) may inject enough energy to halt the contraction @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent works have shown that the formation of binaries should not deplete the population of compact stars within the cluster centre @xcite .",
    "hence , the formation of binaries within the cluster centre should not affect significantly our estimates of mss masses and size , which represent reliable upper limits to the observed mass excesses , despite the simplicity of our approach .    in the following ,",
    "we summarise our main results :    * in order to understand how the global properties of a star cluster affect the formation of an mss , we investigated mass segregation in 168 models of star clusters with different initial density distribution , total mass , imf and metallicity , aiming to quantify their role ; * we found that the mass growth of an mss is characterised by three distinct phases : i ) a fast phase during which @xmath19 increases through orbital decay of heavy stars with small apocentres ; ii ) a second phase during which @xmath19 decreases as a consequence of stellar mass loss ; iii ) a slow phase during which @xmath19 smoothly rises in corrispondence of the occasional orbital decay of stars that move in a peripheral region of the cluster ; * though our results indicate that nor the spatial distribution neither the metallicity play a significant role in determining the final mass of an mss , they are much more effective in determining which kind of stars populate it .",
    "indeed , we found that msss formed in gcs characterised by an initial uniform density distribution should host a significant fraction of ms stars , while in the case of dehnen density profiles the msss are populated mainly by nss and bhs .",
    "furthermore , we found that low metal msss contains more bhs than nss , unlike msss with solar metallicity ; * we have shown that the population of stellar bhs tends to form a tight nucleus , which extends up to @xmath22 pc , quite independently on the gc properties . on the other hand , the distribution of other stellar type is more influenced by the spatial distribution of the host ; * we provided scaling relations connecting the masses of the msss and their host clusters , showing that they are in overall agreement with previous theoretical and observational works . in particular , we have shown that these correlations allow to obtain a value for the central mass excess of clusters @xmath45 cen in excellent agreement with the observed values provided by @xcite ; * in order to test our semi - analytical approach we performed a series of direct @xmath0-body simulations using the code higpus .",
    "moreover , we used higpusse , a modified version of higpus in which we included stellar evolution , in order to highlight its effects on the msss formation process ; * comparing these simulations with our theoretical approach , we demonstrated that the treatment for df used here is well suited to describe the orbital decay of massive stars . moreover , comparing the results obtained with higpus and those obtained through higpusse , we found that stellar evolution seems to not alter significantly the dynamical evolution of the cluster nucleus , where the mss form ; * we have shown that our treatment allows to predict quite precisely which kind of stars will populate the mss , as shown through the comparison with the @xmath0-body runs ; * the global properties of the host cluster reflect the ongoing formation of an mss . for instance , we observed in ` 262k_sen_d_s ` a significant increase in the slope of the surface density profile of the cluster and in the slope of the velocity dispersion ; * the agreement found between our semi - analytical estimates and the direct @xmath0-body simulations indicates that the procedure followed in this paper can be used to provide reliable initial conditions for simulating the long - term evolution of gcs .",
    "this would allow to significantly shorten the computational time needed to model the long - term evolution of a gc , since the completion of the mass segregation process in a typical gc would require computational times that exceed one month .",
