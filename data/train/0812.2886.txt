    "the clarity of the analysis owes exactly to the low scattered particle fraction . with the initial macroscopic luminosity , that poses no problem for detectability , but , more importantly",
    ", the relative background ( actually , all the diverse kinds thereof ) is suppressed .    in case when wave nature of the scattered particles is relevant , the backward scattering can sometimes get enhanced as compared with that at other large angles  due to some or the other kinematical symmetry ( coherent backscattering ) .    for hadrons , which are objects composed of quarks , one can detect the events of single quark backscattering by separating ( single- ) flavor exchange reactions to high energy .",
    "thereat , most probably , only one pair of quarks ( of different flavor ) scatters backwards and then recombines with the forward - moving hadron remnants .",
    "there is no external gluonic radiation in the fully exclusive reaction , because of color confinement .",
    "besides , there is no necessity to rise the energy to extremely high values , where some internal radiative effects should eventually become important .",
    "owing to the hardness present in the process , a plausible approximation for it is one - gluon exchange .",
    "the latter is impact parameter conserving , which is convenient for the overlap representation of the scattering matrix element in terms of quark wave functions of hadrons , as was partially discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "but yet , at energies high enough , the energy dependence of flavor - exchange reactions departs notably from the one - gluon - exchange prediction @xmath2 , which is referred to as reggeization phenomenon .",
    "it is desirable to get it incorporated in the theory , within the impulse approximation treatment .    in 1967 ,",
    "gorshkov , gribov , lipatov , and frolov @xcite ( see also textbook @xcite ) had evaluated double - leading - logarithmic asymptotics ( dlla ) of feynman integrals corresponding to @xmath3 back - angle scattering in qed , and resumed to all orders .",
    "they had found a power falloff slowdown ( basically , @xmath4-independent ) .",
    "later , kirschner @xcite , being generally interested in dlla of qcd elementary scattering processes , examined quark - quark backward scattering , and quark - antiquark forward / backward annihilation , paralleling the framework of @xcite .",
    "the negative signature amplitude was thereafter computed by kirschner and lipatov @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath0 backward scattering , which is the kernel of the hadron binary reaction overlap matrix element , has the asymptotics @xmath5 with @xmath6 the modified bessel function , and @xmath7 ( account of single logarithms can somewhat change the index in ( [ regge th ] ) , but the effect of that correction is rather uncertain in view of our poor knowledge of the coupling constant @xmath8 , anyway . )    letting numerically @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and assuming that for reactions such as @xmath11 small feynman-@xmath12 contribution is moderate ( given that constituent quark models work rather well for nucleon ) , one obtains an estimate @xmath13 this asymptotics is expected to hold when @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are valence quark numbers in the colliding hadrons .",
    "that numerically implies @xmath17    the correspondence of ( [ power - num ] ) with the experimental behavior is _ not _ too bad .",
    "the best experimental representative of flavor exchange reactions is @xmath11 , given the detailed data available for @xmath18 and even some data for polarization for this reaction , and in addition ",

    "the regge trajectory slope for @xmath11 is small ( see fig .  [",

    "in contrast , for meson flavor exchange , particularly for @xmath19 ( usually quoted as having an examplary linear regge trajectory ) the slope seems to be close to chew - frautchi substantial value 0.8  @xmath20 .",
    "but it is to be minded that in the pion charge exchange case there are cancelations between @xmath21 scattering and @xmath22 annihilation , and in itself , pion is a more relativistic system then nucleon , probably , with a larger contribution from small @xmath12 . altogether",

    "although those can be given independent meaning , physically they both are related to emission and reabsorption of bremsstrahlung photons , with the energy smaller then the mass of the radiating particle ( in the ir soft case ) , or then the collision energy ( in the ir collinear case ) .",
    "so , it is natural that they obey the same cancelation principles . for back - angle scattering of equal - charge particles , or with perfect charge ( color ) exchange , ir cancelations must be working at full strength .",

    "the longitudinal hard gluons pertain to hard physics , whereas the braking fermions  to the soft .",

    "that reflects the circumstance that soft and hard physics are not separated absolutely , but only within the logarithmic accuracy .",
    "a similar situation ( not encountered at forward scattering ) is often met at description of exclusive hadronic processes with a large momentum transfer ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "let us remark that in @xcite the extraction of dlla contributions is conducted by prior integration over @xmath120 , in analogy with the sudakov s vertex asymptotic treatment @xcite . that renders the framework more symmetric appearance , but the wave - function interpretation gets obscured .",

    "when @xmath155 , the largest terms in sum ( [ i1 ] ) have numbers @xmath156 equally , and independently of the overall energy , one can say that each gluon typically shifts the quark rapidity by @xmath157 this implies that for the given problem the multi - peripheral approximation is very safe .",
    "the transverse motion of quarks in the ladder rails is usually regarded as random walk . at that , the rung gluons propagate nearly forward ( since , in the eikonal approximation , their propagators do not depend on transverse momenta ) , and so , impact parameters of the final @xmath27-quark must coincide with that of the initial @xmath25-quark , and impact parameter of the final @xmath25-quark  with that of the initial @xmath27-quark . thereby , the walk is not completely random .",
    "yet , the walk step is small as compared to typical hadronic radius ( recall that large @xmath119 dominate ) , so the initial quark impact parameters must be close to one another , anyway .",
    "the mechanistic picture of reggeization is observed to fall into certain contrast with the analyticity and duality expectations . in particular , transversal hardness excludes exact analogy with meson exchange in the @xmath4-channel , and yet suggests that the quark - exchange reggeization phenomenon , and the relevant intercept , may be universal , or there can be a few universal reggeons ( much less numerous then the host of mesons ) .",
    "the similarity of the regge ladder diagram with that of the bethe - salpeter equation must not be deluding , given the dominance in the present case of large @xmath158 ( let alone the excessive hardness of the ladder @xmath27-channel gluons ) .",
    "in their own turn , mesons , being strongly bound relativistic states , for which the interaction radius is not small compared to the average inter - constituent distance must not necessarily obey a bethe - salpeter - like equation at all .",
    "in what concerns the hadron wave function overlap representation , the hardness of the regge ladder implies that one can rather safely exploit the notion of coincidence of colliding quark impact parameters  unless the energy becomes super - high , giving the short - step transverse random walk eventually a spread comparable to the hadron size .",
    "another feature important at hadron wave function overlap computations is that the reggeized kernel ( [ regge th ] ) is not scale - invariant , and does not factorize in terms of feynman - x of the active quarks : @xmath159 and it is only in far asymptotics ( [ regge asympt ] ) , where some noninteger - power scaling law and factorization set in .",
    "finally , note that amplitude ( [ regge th ] ) is neither even , nor odd function of @xmath66 , in contrast to the kernel in born approximation .",
