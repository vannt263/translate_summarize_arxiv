    "dwarf nova oscillations ( dnos ) were first recognized in outbursts of dwarf novae and in nova - like variables ; that is , during stages of high mass transfer rates ( @xmath0 ) from companion to the white dwarf primary of cataclysmic variables ( warner & robinson 1972 ) .",
    "their short time scales ( @xmath150  s ) indicate originations close to the surface of the primary , but their large variations in period distinguish them from the short period highly stable magnetic accretors such as dq her and ae aqr ( for a general review see warner 1995a ) . paczynski ( 1978 ) suggested that these variations result from the torque acting on an accreted equatorial belt on the primary during phases of changing @xmath0 .",
    "this model has been extended in warner ( 1995b ) and the earlier papers in this series ( woudt & warner 2002 , warner & woudt 2002 , 2006 ; warner , woudt & pretorius 2003 ; pretorius , warner & woudt 2006 ) ; a review is given in warner ( 2004 ) .    in this contribution",
    "we reinvestigate some early observations , in the light of later developments , looking specifically for additional evidence relevant to the low inertia magnetic accretor ( lima ) model ( warner & woudt 2002 ; hereafter ww2002 ) . in section 2",
    "we compare predicted and observed rates of change of spin on the rise and fall of dwarf nova outbursts ; in section 3 we look at possible incidences of a propellering phase late in dwarf nova outbursts ; in section 4 we consider the question of ` coherence ' of dnos ; in section 5 we suggest a model for the multiple dnos in wz sge , their behaviour during outburst , and their possible relevance to the distinct group of longer period dnos ( lpdnos ) .",
    "section 6 contains a short general conclusion .",
    "our concept of the progress of dnos through a dwarf nova outburst is that , at the beginning of outburst , material moving inwards and reaching the inner parts of the accretion disc is either magnetically channeled into the equatorial regions of the primary or reaches the equator without channeling , depending on the magnetic field in the inner regions .",
    "even if the field of the primary is quite small , differential rotation of the ensuing equatorial belt can use this seed field and may amplify it to the point where channeling can occur ( ww2002 ) .",
    "the accretion zones generated by channeling are directly or indirectly responsible for the dnos . below some critical field of the primary ( estimated in ww2002 to be @xmath2 ) there will be no channeling and no dnos during outburst . this is why otherwise very similar systems can exhibit completely different behaviours of their dnos ( e.g. vw hyi and ek tra ; warner & woudt 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , for primary fields less than @xmath3 the outer regions are not coupled to the interior of the primary and so the accreted gas is free to rotate as an equatorial belt as it builds up in mass during the outburst .",
    "it is , however , magnetically coupled to the disc in the same way as in intermediate polars ( ips ) , and therefore as the inner edge of the disc moves inwards through the increased thrust of the mass inflow , accessing shorter periods of rotation , the belt is spun up , and vice versa after maximum of outburst . through the maximum phases of outburst the accretion is near equilibrium disc accretion , as is evidenced by the higher stability ( e.g. observed low @xmath4 ) of the dnos during those times .",
    "we here extend the quantitative aspects of this model , as developed in ww2002 : we note that from the standard theory of accretion from a disc into a magnetosphere ( e.g. ghosh & lamb 1979 ; chapter 7 of warner 1995a ) the angular acceleration generated by the combined material and magnetic torques acting on an equatorial belt with mass @xmath5 , given in equation ( 5 ) of ww2002 , can be written in terms of the period of rotation @xmath6 of the belt as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the torque function , @xmath9 is the `` fastness parameter '' , given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radius of the inner edge of the disc and @xmath12 is the corotation radius , found from @xmath13 , @xmath5 is the mass of the belt , @xmath14 is its angular velocity , @xmath0 is the rate of mass transfer onto the primary , and @xmath15 is the mass of the primary .",
    "subscripts denote cgs values in powers of ten , with the exception that @xmath16 is used for mass in solar units .",
    "an outburst can be partitioned into two sets of conditions : on the rise and on the fall the accretion process is not close to equilibrium , i.e. the rotation periods of the belt and the inner edge of the accretion disc are significantly different , but around maximum the accretion is close to equilibrium , with the result that @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . on the rise and fall , however , we have @xmath20 ( wang 1987 ) and @xmath21 , so the factor @xmath22 in equation ( 1 ) is bounded by @xmath23 ; the upper bound comes from the requirement that gas threading onto field lines must lie within the corotation radius , and the lower bound arises from ( a ) the requirement that @xmath24 and ( b ) the observed low values of @xmath6 for the dnos that imply that the inner edge of the disc is never very far from the surface of the primary .",
    "next we note that @xmath0 during the outburst phases of interest here probably does not vary greatly .",
    "the models of accretion during outburst produced by cannizzo ( 1993 ) show that , from the mid - point of optical rise to the midpoint of optical decline , @xmath0 onto the primary varies only about a factor of two about the average .",
    "these correspond roughly to the phases over which most dnos are observed .",
    "therefore the mass of the equatorial belt ( which we assume to be very small at the outset ) during the interesting parts of the outburst can be approximated by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the time since the start of outburst .",
    "for the two non - equilibrium phases we therefore have ( with appropriate choices of sign ) @xmath27^{4/3}\\left(p/25\\,\\,\\mathrm{s}\\right)^{7/3}t^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is measured in days .",
    "we therefore expect @xmath28 on the rise and @xmath29 on the fall of a normal dwarf nova outburst . in tables 1 and 2",
    "we tabulate values of @xmath4 deduced from published observations .",
    "there are relatively few usable observations : for the rise this is because very few dwarf novae have been caught early on the rise , and for the decline it is because the dnos often become too ` incoherent ' to detect with fourier transforms late in outburst . as an example , vw hyi is one of the most intensively studied systems ( see list of observations in woudt and warner 2002 ) but has never been caught showing dnos on the rise , and there is only one detection of a dno on the decline before the rapid deceleration phase begins , as described below . and we need to avoid the late rise or early fall where the low @xmath4 characteristic of maximum still has influence .",
    "however , it is immediately obvious from tables 1 and 2 that @xmath30 is roughly a factor of five or more larger on the rise than in mid - decline . in the lima model",
    "this is expected because of the smaller inertia of the equatorial belt in the rising phase , compared with that of the almost fully accreted mass late in decline .",
    "furthermore , after allowance for the range of parameters ( e.g. @xmath31 and @xmath32 in ss cyg , which have opposite influences in equation ( 2 )  and this is a general rule , the higher mass primaries will generate shorter period dnos ) there is moderately good agreement with the predictions of equation ( 2 ) .",
    "this is new evidence for the viability of the lima model .",
    "the notably larger values of @xmath4 in table  2 , observed for oy car , ss cyg and ty psa _ late _ in decline , are discussed in the next section , along with a similar effect seen in vw hyi .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it will be seen that the brightness of ty psa fell at almost exactly the same rate at the ends of the two outbursts ; this is a well known feature of dwarf novae ",
    "normal and superoutbursts have nearly identical decline light curves ( warner 1995a : and see ww2002 for details of vw hyi light curves ) .",
    "we have analysed the light curves in the standard fashion using fourier transforms ( fts ) , and also amplitude / phase ( @xmath33 ) diagrams , where we fit sinusoids , with periods derived from the fts , by least squares to short sections of the light curve to determine the amplitudes and phases of the dnos as functions of time .",
    "in wow the @xmath33 diagram was ( correctly ) described as having coherent oscillations of only short duration , responsible for the noticeable broadening of the peak in the ft , compared with dnos of longer coherence in three previous nights .",
    "as plotted in wow the @xmath33 diagram appears quite chaotic , but we noticed that with suitable adjustments of sections of the diagram , permitted by the @xmath34 phase ambiguity of any point , a more systematic picture appears . we show this in fig .  1 , where @xmath35 is measured relative to a fixed period of 30.17  s , and where we have partitioned the diagram into regions of clearly increasing or decreasing @xmath35 and have indicated the dno periods @xmath6 derived from fts of each of those short sections .",
    "it is clear that @xmath6 alternates between two values ",
    "approximately 30  s and 31  s , and it does so on a timescale @xmath36 , which is close to the beat period @xmath37 between the alternating values .",
    "an ft of fig .",
    "1 shows a strong peak at @xmath38 , with a sub - harmonic at @xmath39 .",
    "much of the @xmath35 variation in fig .  1 is therefore describable by a switching between a sidereal period @xmath40 and a synodic period @xmath41 , and back again , at the beat period between the two .",
    "the similarity to the behaviour of vw hyi , mentioned above , is evident",
    ".     is systematically increasing are isolated .",
    ", width=317 ]      in wow it was stated that run s3372 does not contain any dno signal , which , if it were the case that dnos were really present , was attributed to a probable complete loss of coherence and hence invisibility in the ft .",
    "however , using an @xmath33 search , with a dno period initially extrapolated from the @xmath6 trend on previous nights , has revealed that there is one section of the light curve , lasting for almost exactly an hour , that does have a detectable signal .",
    "this is shown as an @xmath33 diagram in fig .  2 , with reference period 38.0  s , where it is seen to be another example of alternation between two distinct periods , in this case @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which have a beat period @xmath38 , similar to the previous night , but",
    "now the switching time scale has doubled to @xmath44  s.     diagram of a @xmath45 section of run s3372 .",
    "@xmath46 can be seen to alternate between increasing and decreasing .",
    ", width=317 ]      wow did not detect any dnos in this short run , and it is true that an ft of the whole run does not show any convincing signal , but more detailed investigation shows an initial short - lived presence of quite high amplitude but uncertain period , and a persistent dno at 47.0  s of low amplitude in the second half of the run . at this stage",
    "ty psa was still about 1 mag above its quiescent magnitude .      in wow",
    "it was noted that this light curve possesses a dno of large amplitude with a period of 26.5  s. its properties are similar to those seen for run s3365 in fig .",
    "13 of wow and are characteristic of the early outburst decline , rather than late decline , and are not of particular interest here .",
    "wow noticed only a qpo with period @xmath47 in this run .",
    "however , we find that there is also a dno present that changes its period so rapidly that its peak in the ft of the raw light curve is of low amplitude and greatly broadened , as seen in the ft displayed in the left hand panel of fig .  3 .",
    "the dno is clear in the @xmath33 diagram ( right hand panels of fig .",
    "3 ) , where the reference period is 38.59  s , but we have not found it possible to find an unambiguous interpretation of the variations . what is evident , though , are at least four large peaks of amplitude , spaced roughly 500  s apart and plotted as larger symbols in fig .  3 , and concomitant rapid switches between different periods of roughly 38.6  s and a period probably about 2 s longer .",
    "we have the impression that while the @xmath38 modulation ( at twice the qpo period ) is present the behaviour is similar to what is seen in fig .  2 .",
    "run 3417 , unremarked by wow , has a qpo with period @xmath48 , which is similar to that seen on the previous night .",
    "we do not detect any dnos in this run .",
    "we have found that dnos are present later in the outburst light curve of ty psa than had previously been realized .",
    "there is abundant evidence of the kind of switching between sidereal and synodic dnos only previously seen in vw hyi ( ww2006 ) . on the outburst",
    "decline a qpo periodicity at @xmath49 and its multiples is present . from a different perspective",
    ", we can say that a period @xmath39 and its first and second harmonics are favoured , which again resembles the behaviour of vw hyi ( ww2006 ) .    in the light curves of ty psa analysed here",
    "we have not found any evidence of lpdnos , having typically four times the periods of dnos ( warner , woudt & pretorius ( 2003 ; hereafter wwp ) .",
    "however , they are occasionally present in this star , as shown in fig .  3 of warner ( 2004 ) .",
    "we aim in this section to offer a model for the site of the lpdnos alternative to that put forward by wwp .",
    "our approach is via a hitherto unexplained periodic modulation in the dwarf nova wz sge .",
    "wz sge is unusual in possessing a set of dnos even during quiescence , which show complicated behaviour during the very rare outbursts .",
    "the key phenomena are : + quiescence    1 .",
    "two optical modulations are observed , at 27.868 and 28.952  s , discovered by robinson , nather & patterson ( 1978 ) . in general either one or the other modulation is present , but occasionally both are seen simultaneously .",
    "2 .   no harmonics of the 27.87-s modulation are observed , but on rare occasions a first harmonic of the 28.95-s modulation is seen ( provencal & nather 1997 ) .",
    "the 27.87-s signal has substantial phase noise but is a good long - term clock ( patterson 1980 ; patterson et al .",
    "the long - term stability of the 28.95-s signal has not been established .",
    "4 .   hard x - ray , soft x - ray and @xmath50 modulations have been observed at the 27.87-s period ( patterson et al .",
    "1998 ; skidmore et al . 1999 ) ; however , the 28.95-s periodicity is not associated with any such high energy radiation .",
    "sidebands are observed to the 27.87-s modulation , which have been used in support of a rotating magnetic model for the white dwarf in wz sge ( warner , tout & livio 1996 ; lasota , kuulkers & charles 1999 ; patterson et al . 1998 ; ww2002 ) . 6 .",
    "patterson ( 1980 ) suggested that the 28.95-s signal could be generated from the 27.87-s signal if the latter is reprocessed from a site moving revolving progradely in orbit at the beat period between the two , i.e. with a period of 742  s. w2002 found just such a period in light curves of wz sge and associated it with the same type of traveling wave that generates qpos in the lima model .    outburst    1 .",
    "dnos were observed during the 2001 superoutburst of wz sge , with a dominant period of @xmath51 and short - lived modulations at @xmath52 thirty days after maximum ( knigge et al . 2002 ) , and @xmath53 fifty days after supermaximum ( welsh et al .",
    "the 27.87-s periodicity had not reappeared two years later ( mukai & patterson 2004 ) .",
    "it was undetectable for nearly 18 years after the 1978 outburst .",
    "2 .   in contrast to the latter ,",
    "the 28.95-s modulation was detected by these observers with an apparently unchanged period at various times during the outburst .",
    "these behaviours show certain similarities to other dwarf novae during outburst  namely , the increase in @xmath6 on the decline of outburst and the frequency doubling observed at high @xmath0 in ss cyg ( mauche 1998 ) , which may be caused by changing geometry ( ww2002 ) or by the increasing importance of higher magnetic multipoles close to the primary .",
    "furthermore , the independence of the 28.95-s period on luminosity of the system resembles that observed for the lpdnos , which have been interpreted as arising from accretion directly onto the primary , i.e. , associated with the spin of the primary , not of its equatorial belt ( wwp ) .",
    "there are also interesting comparisons to be made with gk per , an ip nova remnant showing dwarf nova outbursts .",
    "it has a large amplitude 351.3-s modulation in the x - ray region during outburst ( watson , king & osborne 1985 ; hellier , harmer & beardmore 2004 ) which persists during quiescence ( norton , watson & king 1988 ) .",
    "the 351-s period is detected in optical light curves in quiescence ( patterson 1991 ) but not convincingly during outburst ( cf .",
    "nogami et al . 2002 ) .",
    "optical quasi - periodic oscillations are seen in quiescence and outburst with a mean period near 380 s ( patterson 1981 , 1991 ; mazeh et al .",
    "1985 ; nogami et al .",
    "a longer period qpo is seen during outburst near 5000 s , which is the beat period between the 351-s and 380-s modulations , in x - rays ( watson et al .",
    "1985 ; hellier et al . 2004 ) and optical emission line profiles ( morales - rueda , still & roche 1999 ) but not during quiescence .",
    "the 5000-s x - ray qpos have been explained by hellier et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in terms of the lima model , with a traveling wave at the inner edge of the disc .    during outbursts of gk per",
    "there are no observed dnos ( which would be expected to progress to lower periods than 351 s if they existed ) .",
    "complete absence of dnos is a property of ips in general and is interpreted as implying that the magnetic field on the primary is strong enough to prevent slippage of the equatorial belt ( ww2002 ) .",
    "finally , we note that wz sge has probable low amplitude 27.87-s modulation in soft x - rays and even weaker in hard x - rays ( patterson et al .",
    "1998 ) , the dnos in dwarf novae and nova - like systems have large amplitude soft x - ray modulation , but at most weak signals in hard x - rays , and gk per , as with all ips , has predominantly hard x - ray modulation .",
    "the observational properties listed in the previous section show that wz sge appears to be a bridge between the standard ip and the lima models . in quiescence the primary s magnetic field is barely strong enough to couple the accreting surface regions to the interior , producing considerable phase noise in the 27.87-s spin modulation , but during outburst a slipping accretion zone is possible .",
    "two possible sites suggest themselves for the generation of the 28.95-s periodicity : ( a ) the main body of the primary , rotating with that period , in which case 27.87  s must be the period of a permanently slipping equatorial belt , or ( b ) the region just outside the corotation radius in the disc .",
    "both sites retain their rotation periods independent of the very large mass transfer variations that occur during outburst .",
    "the former is unlikely because we would expect x - ray production from accretion onto the primary as well as its equatorial belt , but no 28.95-s x - ray modulation is observed .",
    "the latter holds more promise .    for wz sge , @xmath54 . at this point",
    "we mention another rapid rotator , ae aqr , which has @xmath55 ( patterson 1979 ) and such a low @xmath0 that almost all accretion is propellered out of the system ( e.g. eracleous & horne 1996 ) . in his discovery paper patterson ( 1979 )",
    "pointed out that , as well as the prominent 33.08-s modulation , there were frequent appearances of a @xmath56-s modulation and its first harmonic . the more comprehensive later study ( patterson 1994 ) shows that the harmonic of this feature , with @xmath57 , is present strongly during ` flaring ' episodes of ae aqr , and is only very weakly present in quiescence .",
    "skidmore et al .",
    "( 2003 ) also noticed a longer period ( 34.23  s ) during a flare .",
    "the ratio @xmath58 is comparable to what is observed in wz sge and again may imply that activity in the vicinity of the corotation radius is generating a modulation . in the case of ae aqr",
    "it seems certain that propellering , which begins to operate at and beyond @xmath12 , is a dominating mechanism , so we suspect that milder propellering is in action in wz sge , centrifuging gas out on field lines that connect to the disc just beyond @xmath12 , during both quiescence and outburst .",
    "propellering has already been invoked in wz sge , to explain the very long intervals between superoutbursts  a result of the inner parts of the disc being cleared of gas by the primary s magnetosphere , preventing outbursts from starting near the inner edge of the disc , and allowing large amounts of mass to accumulate in the outer regions ( matthews et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we are now ready to propose a specific model for the generation of modulations from a region near the corotation radius .",
    "magnetic field lines connecting from the primary to gas revolving at keplerian velocities in an annulus just beyond @xmath12 are twisted back and produce a retarding torque on the primary . in the annulus a blob of threaded gas is concomitantly accelerated azimuthally _ and radially outwards _ by the field lines , the maximum effect occurring where the field ( for a tilted rotating dipole ) is largest , producing a radial velocity @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the ratio of the toroidal to the vertical field strengths ( close to zero at @xmath12 ) , @xmath61 is the thermal sound velocity and @xmath62 is of the order of unity ( aly & kuijpers 1990 , hereafter ak ) .",
    "immediately outside @xmath12 the radial velocity is subsonic but twisting of the field is already underway .",
    "eventually the threaded gas reaches supersonic velocity and shock waves begin to form .",
    "ak show that the short - lived shocks spiral outwards and remove excess angular momentum .",
    "for a tilted dipole field a group of such shocked areas will develop each side of the disc , being carried around at a period close to the keplerian period of the annulus , not far outside of @xmath12 , in which the shocks occur .",
    "heating by the shocks will thicken the disc locally ; it is the cessation of this heating when the field lines snap and reconnect that was hypothesized by ww2002 to be the excitation mechanism for generating the slow prograde traveling wave at the inner edge of the disc , which produces the qpos .",
    "we suggest that the two shock regions , revolving as bright regions in the disc ( which individually may be viewed differently , depending on orbital inclination , optical thickness of the disc , etc . )",
    "generate the fundamental and/or harmonic of the 28.95-s and 30.5-s modulations seen respectively in wz sge and ae aqr .",
    "an estimate of the total luminosity @xmath63 expected from the shock regions is provided by ak .",
    "their equation ( 25 ) can be written @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the scale height of the disc in units of @xmath67  cm , and @xmath68 . from modelling the outbursts of wz sge , matthews et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find they require @xmath69 .",
    "for @xmath70 ( spruit & rutten 1998 ) we have @xmath71 , and therefore @xmath72 . when compared with the accretion luminosity of wz sge , @xmath73 ( smak 1993 ) it is evident that a detectable weak modulated signal could well be generated from the shock regions .",
    "the period @xmath74 of this signal will not be completely stable  variations of conditions in the threading annulus will result in small changes in @xmath75 and hence also in @xmath74 .",
    "we note that according to equation ( 6 ) @xmath63 may expected to be observable only in systems with low accretion luminosity , as is the case for wz sge ( @xmath76 ; smak 1993 ) and ae aqr ( @xmath77 onto the primary ; wynn , king & horne 1997 ) . at higher @xmath0",
    ", @xmath78 only increases @xmath79 and so @xmath80 could be expected to fall rapidly during the outburst of a dwarf nova ( or in the high state of a nova - like variable ) .",
    "but the possibility of an enhanced field in the equatorial belt , leading to an increase of @xmath81 by a factor of a few ( ww2002 ) might , from equation ( 6 ) , still give rise to a detectable @xmath74 signal . in that case , it is possible that all the lpdno signals that are observed in cvs arise not from accretion zones on the body of the primary , as suggested in wwp , but from the shock regions just outside the corotation radius .",
    "these two sites may be observationally distinguishable by photometry of lpdnos during eclipse .",
    "the nova - like ec 21178 - 5417 could provide this opportunity  it has lpdnos with periods @xmath82  s and deep eclipses ( wwp ) .",
    "for @xmath83 the source of the modulation is either at @xmath84 or near @xmath85 , a difference that might be discernable during eclipse ingress or egress , though it must be kept in mind that the whole disc could be involved in the optical signals through reprocessing of radiation from the sources .",
    "a principal result of this study is further evidence that the variations in period or phase of dnos are best described by switching between two periods  the sidereal period , determined by the rotation period of an accreted equatorial belt , and a synodic period , probably generated by reprocessing of the radiation emitted from accretion zones on the equatorial belt .",
    "this effect is only seen where the dno amplitudes are large enough to enable detailed analysis , but may be suspected to hold in general .",
    "we point out that propellering of accreting gas may commonly occur towards the end of dwarf nova outbursts , depending on the existence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field on the primary .",
    "we suggest that the longer period dnos might be located at regions just beyond the corotation radius , rather than on the surface of the primary , and that previously observed but not understood periodicities in wz sge and ae aqr arise from this source .",

    "<S> we examine published observations of dwarf nova oscillations ( dnos ) on the rise and decline of outbursts and show that their rates of change are in reasonable agreement with those predicted from the magnetic accretion model . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for propellering in the late stages of outburst of several dwarf novae , as shown by reductions in _ euve _ fluxes and from rapid increases of the dno periods . </S>",
    "<S> reanalysis of dnos observed in ty psa , which had particularly large amplitudes , shows that the apparent loss of coherence during late decline is better described as a regular switching between two nearby periods . </S>",
    "<S> it is partly this and the rapid deceleration in some systems that make the dnos harder to detect .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the 28.95  s periodicity in wz sge , which has long been a puzzle , is caused by heated regions in the disc , just beyond the corotation radius , which are a consequence of magnetic coupling between the primary and gas in the accretion disc . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a possible new interpretation of the ` longer period dnos ' ( lpdnos ) commonly observed in dwarf novae and nova - like variables .    </S>",
