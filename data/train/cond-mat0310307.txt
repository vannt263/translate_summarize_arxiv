    "the nature of electronic states in disordered tight - binding models with site - diagonal uncorrelated disorder was firstly studied by anderson  @xcite when the localization of quantum states was discussed in connection with the transport properties of a random lattice .",
    "one of the most remarkable effects of disorder , which has been demonstrated by several authors , is the exponential localization of all one - electron eigen - states in the one - dimensional anderson model , irrespective to the strength of disorder   @xcite .",
    "the electron localization in random lattices is a result of destructive quantum interference due to incoherent backscattering .",
    "therefore , the localization phenomenon occurs in general model systems involving wave propagation in random media .",
    "recently , the existence of delocalized states in several variants of the low - dimensional anderson models has been reported   @xcite . in these works",
    ", the presence of short or long - range correlations appears as the fundamental mechanism responsible for the emergence of extended states .",
    "this theoretical prediction about suppression of localization was recently confirmed experimentally in doped polyaniline  @xcite , semiconductor superlattices with intentional correlated disorder  @xcite as well as microwave transmission spectra of single - mode waveguides with inserted correlated scatterers  @xcite . among these models ,",
    "the diluted anderson chain has attracted a renewed interest  @xcite .",
    "hilke  @xcite introduced an anderson model with diagonal disorder diluted by an underlying periodicity .",
    "the model consisted of two interpenetrating sub - lattices , one composed of random potentials ( anderson lattice ) and the other composed of non - random segments of constant potentials . due to the periodicity",
    ", special resonance energies appear which are related to the lattice constant of the non - random lattice .",
    "the number of resonance energies is independent of the system size and , therefore , it was conjectured that these states should nt have any influence on the transport properties in the infinite size limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors presented a simple model for alloys of compound semiconductors by introducing a one - dimensional binary random system where impurities are placed in one sublattice while host atoms lie on the other sublattice .",
    "the existence of an extended state at the band center was demonstrated , both analytic and numerically .",
    "the diluted anderson model was recently extended to include a general diluting function which defines the on - site energies within each non - random segment  @xcite . using a block decimation approach",
    ", it was demonstrated that this model displays a set of extended states , the number of which strongly depends on the length of the diluting segments and the symmetries of the diluting function .    in this work",
    "we will use the matrix decimation method and the transfer matrix technique to provide accurate estimates of the set of extended states in general 1d diluted anderson models . the density of states ( dos )",
    "will be shown to display a set of gaps whose number and width depend on the set of impurities used to dilute the disordered lattice .",
    "further , we will investigate the influence of such resonant extended states on the wave - packet dynamics .",
    "our results suggest that , in spite of the number of resonance energies being independent of the system size  @xcite , these extended states induce a sub - diffusive spread of an initially localized wave - packet .",
    "the standard one - dimensional anderson model is described by a tridiagonal hamiltonian @xmath1\\ ] ] where disorder is introduced on the site energies @xmath2 which are uncorrelated random numbers chosen from a previously defined distribution . in our calculations",
    ", we will use energy units such that the hopping term @xmath3 and the random site energies will be taken uniformly from the interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the diluted anderson model is constructed by introducing a sequence of @xmath5 new sites between each original pair of neighboring sites .",
    "these sequences are all identical and the on - site energies within such sequences are given by @xmath0 , @xmath6 .    to study the properties of the one - electron eigen - states , we employ a transfer matrix calculation ( tm ) in order to obtain the lyapunov exponent defined as the inverse of the localization length @xmath7 .",
    "the schroedinger equation for the present tight - binding model is : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an eigenstate with energy @xmath10 .",
    "the above equation can be rewritten as a transfer matrix equation @xmath11 based on the asymptotic behavior of the matrix product @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are @xmath14 transfer matrices , the lyapunov exponent @xmath15 can be defined as :     obtained using the dean s method for a chain with @xmath16 sites of the diluted 1d anderson model with dimer segments of identical on - site energies @xmath17 .",

    "in addition , the lyapunov exponent can be obtained using a decimation renormalization - group ( drg ) technique which is based on the particular form of the equation of motion satisfied by the green s operator matrix elements @xmath31_{i , j}=\\langle i|1/(e - h)|j\\rangle $ ] @xcite : @xmath32_{n+\\mu , n } & = & \\delta _",

    "therefore , the decimation - renormalization technique consists in removing iteratively the sites @xmath35 of the system obtaining in that way the effective energies of the external sites and the effective hopping between them by using the iterative equations @xmath36 where , after @xmath37 decimations , @xmath38 denotes the renormalized diagonal element at site @xmath27 and @xmath26 indicates the effective renormalized hopping connecting the sites @xmath39 and @xmath27 . the behavior of the effective interaction @xmath26 during the decimation procedure can be used as another evidence of the localized / delocalized nature of the one - electron states .",
    "an oscillatory behavior of @xmath26 , as a function of @xmath27 , signals an extended state . on the contrary , an exponentially localized state results in an exponential decrease of @xmath26 as the decimation process proceeds . after a large number of decimation steps , the lyapunov exponent is asymptotically related to the effective hopping @xmath26 in the following way : @xmath40 results and discussion ----------------------    in the present study , we use chains with @xmath41 sites in order to calculate the lyapunov exponent within the entire energy band .",

    "the emergence of extended states for this particular dilution was analytically demonstrated in ref  @xcite .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) for general 1d tight - binding models can be obtained by using the negative eigenvalue theorem@xcite . in fig .",
    "1(a ) we show typical plots of the dos of chains with @xmath16 sites and several @xmath42 values . in this diluted chain ,",
