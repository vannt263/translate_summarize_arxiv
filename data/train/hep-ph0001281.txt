    "we have gathered to celebrate the fact that bates has been delivering beam successfully for twenty five years and to review some of the things which have been learned and which are still to be studied .",
    "one thing that _ has _ changed theoretically during this period is that we now have a new paradigm for analysis of low energy processes such as studied at bates .",
    "i was a student in the 1960 s and at that time our goal was to attempt to find a renormalizable field theory which describes all particle interactions with the same sort of success as quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . in 1967",
    "we went part of the way with development of the weinberg - salam theory , which incorporated the weak interaction as a sibling to the electromagnetic .",
    "because the interaction was weak it could be treated via the same perturbative techniques as could its electromagnetic kin and what has resulted is an extremely successful description of all weak and electromagnetic processes .    for the strong interactions",
    "a renormalizable picture has also been developed ",
    "quantum chromodynamics or qcd .",
    "the theory is , of course , deceptively simple on the surface . indeed",
    "the form of the lagrangian ] where @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 ) are the su(3 ) gell - mann matrices , operating in color space , and the color - field tensor is defined by @xmath3   \\ , , \\ ] ] ] @xmath4 is elegant , and the theory is renormalizable .",
    "so why are we not satisfied ?",
    "while at the very largest energies , asymptotic freedom allows the use of perturbative techniques , for those who are interested in making contact with low energy experimental findings there exist at least three fundamental difficulties :    * qcd is written in terms of the `` wrong '' degrees of freedom  quarks and gluons  while low energy experiments are performed with hadronic bound states ; * the theory is non - linear due to gluon self interactions ; * the theory is one of strong coupling@xmath5so that perturbative methods are not practical .",
    "nevertheless , there has been a great deal of recent progress in making contact between theory and experiment using the technique of \" effective field theory  , which exploits the chiral symmetry of the qcd interaction .",
    "in order to understand how this is accomplished , we shall first review this idea of effective field theory in the simple context of quantum mechanics .",
    "then we show how these ideas can be married via chiral perturbation theory and indicate applications at bates .",
    "the power of effective field theory is associated with the feature that there exist many situations in physics involving _ two scales _",
    ", one heavy and one light .",
    "then , provided one is working at energies small compared to the heavy scale , it is possible to fully describe the interactions in terms of an `` effective '' picture , which is written only in terms of the light degrees of freedom , but which fully includes the influence of the heavy mass scale through virtual effects .",
    "a number of very nice review articles on effective field theory can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    before proceeding to qcd ,",
    "however , it is useful to study this idea in the simpler context of ordinary quantum mechanics , in order to get familiar with the concept .",
    "specifically , we examine the question of why the sky is blue , whose answer can be found in an analysis of the scattering of photons from the sun by atoms in the atmosphere  compton scattering@xcite .",
    "first we examine the problem using traditional quantum mechanics and consider elastic ( rayleigh ) scattering from , for simplicity , single - electron ( hydrogen ) atoms .",
    "the appropriate hamiltonian is then @xmath6 and the leading@xmath7amplitude for compton scattering is found from calculating the diagrams shown in figure 1 , yielding the familiar kramers - heisenberg form @xmath8\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 represents the hydrogen ground state having binding energy @xmath10 .",
    "here the leading component is the familiar @xmath11-independent thomson amplitude and would appear naively to lead to an energy - independent cross - section .",
    "however , this is _ not _ the case . indeed , by expanding in @xmath11 and using a few quantum mechanical identities one can show that , provided that the energy of the photon is much smaller than a typical excitation energy  as is the case for optical photons , the cross section can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the atomic electric polarizability , @xmath14 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath15 is a typical hydrogen excitation energy .",
    "we note that @xmath16 is of order the atomic volume , as will be exploited below , and that the cross section itself has the characteristic @xmath17 dependence which leads to the blueness of the sky ",
    "blue light scatters much more strongly than red@xcite .",
    "now while the above derivation is certainly correct , it requires somewhat detailed and lengthy quantum mechanical manipulations which obscure the relatively simple physics involved .",
    "one can avoid these problems by the use of effective field theory methods .",
    "the key point is that of scale .",
    "since the incident photons have wavelengths @xmath18a much larger than the @xmath19 1a atomic size , then at leading order the photon is insensitive to the presence of the atom , since the latter is electrically neutral .",
    "if @xmath0 represents the wavefunction of the atom then the effective leading order hamiltonian is simply @xmath20 and there is _ no _ interaction with the field . in higher orders , there _ can _ exist such atom - field interactions and this is where the effective hamiltonian comes in to play . in order to construct the effective interaction ,",
    "we demand certain general principles  this hamiltonian must satisfy fundamental symmetry requirements .",
    "in particular @xmath21 must be gauge invariant , must be a scalar under rotations , and must be even under both parity and time reversal transformations .",
    "also , since we are dealing with compton scattering , @xmath21 should be quadratic in the vector potential . actually , from the requirement of gauge invariance",
    ", it is clear that the effective interaction can utilize @xmath22 only via the electric and magnetic fields , rather than the vector potential itself @xmath23 since these are invariant under a gauge transformation @xmath24 while the vector and/or scalar potentials are not .",
    "the lowest order interaction then can involve only the rotational invariants @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , under spatial inversion@xmath27electric and magnetic fields behave oppositely@xmath28 while @xmath29so that parity invariance rules out any dependence on @xmath26 .",
    "likewise under time reversal invariance @xmath30 so such a term is also t - odd .",
    "the simplest such effective hamiltonian must then have the form @xmath31\\label{eq : ll}\\ ] ] ( terms involving time or spatial derivatives are much smaller . )",
    "we know from electrodynamics that @xmath32 represents the field energy per unit volume , so by dimensional arguments , in order to represent an energy in eq .",
    "[ eq : ll ] , @xmath33 must have dimensions of volume . also , since the photon has such a long wavelength , there is no penetration of the atom , so only classical scattering is allowed .",
    "the relevant scale must then be atomic size so that we can write @xmath34 where we anticipate @xmath35 . finally , since for photons with polarization @xmath36 and four - momentum @xmath37 we identify @xmath38 , then from eq .",
    "[ eq : ii ] , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 as found in the previous section via detailed calculation .",
    "this is a nice example of the power of simple effective field theory arguments .",
    "now let s apply these ideas to the case of qcd . in this case",
    "the invariance we wish to exploit is `` chiral symmetry . ''",
    "the idea of `` chirality '' is defined by the operators @xmath42 which project `` left- '' and `` right - handed '' components of the dirac wavefunction via @xmath43 in terms of these chirality states the quark component of the qcd lagrangian can be written as @xmath44 the reason that these chirality states are called left- and right - handed is that in the limit @xmath45 they coincide with quark _ helicity _ projection operators . with this background",
    ", we note that qcd , in the mathematical limit as @xmath46 has the structure @xmath47 and is invariant under _ independent _ global left- and right - handed rotations @xmath48 this invariance is called @xmath49 or chiral @xmath50 . continuing to neglect the light quark masses , we see that in a chiral symmetric world one would expect to have sixteen  eight left - handed and eight right - handed  conserved noether currents @xmath51 equivalently , by taking the sum and difference we would have eight conserved vector and eight conserved axial vector currents @xmath52 in the vector case , this is just a simple generalization of isospin ( su(2 ) ) invariance to the case of su(3 ) .",
    "there exist _ eight _ ( @xmath53 ) time - independent charges @xmath54 and there exist various supermultiplets of particles having identical spin - parity and ( approximately ) the same mass in the configurations ",
    "singlet , octet , decuplet , _ etc . _ demanded by su(3)-invariance .",
    "if chiral symmetry were realized in the conventional fashion one would expect there also to exist corresponding nearly degenerate same spin but _ opposite _ parity states generated by the action of the time - independent axial charges @xmath55 on these states .",
    "however , it is known that the axial symmetry is broken spontaneously , whereby goldstone s theorem requires the existence of eight massless pseudoscalar bosons , which couple derivatively to the rest of the universe@xcite . of course ,",
    "in the real world such massless @xmath56 states do not exist , because in the real world exact chiral invariance is broken by the small quark mass terms which we have neglected up to this point .",
    "thus what we have are eight very light ( but not massless ) pseudo - goldstone bosons which make up the pseudoscalar octet .",
    "since such states are lighter than their other hadronic counterparts , we have a situation wherein effective field theory can be applied ",
    "provided one is working at energy - momenta small compared to the @xmath57 gev scale which is typical of hadrons , one can describe the interactions of the pseudoscalar mesons using an effective lagrangian .",
    "actually this has been known since the 1960 s , where a good deal of work was done with a _",
    "lowest order _ effective chiral lagrangian@xcite @xmath58 where the subscript 2 indicates that we are working at two - derivative order or one power of chiral symmetry breaking_i.e .",
    "_ @xmath59 .",
    "here @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the pion decay constant .",
    "this lagrangian is _",
    "unique_if we expand to lowest order in @xmath62 @xmath63 we reproduce the free pion lagrangian , as required ,    at the su(3 ) level , including an appropriately generalized chiral symmetry breaking term , there is even predictive power  one has @xmath64",
    "@xmath65 where @xmath66 is a constant and @xmath67 is the quark mass matrix .",
    "we can then identify the meson masses as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mean light quark mass .",
    "this system of three equations is _ overdetermined _ , and we find by simple algebra @xmath70 which is the gell - mann - okubo mass relation and is well - satisfied experimentally@xcite .",
    "expanding to fourth order in the fields we also reproduce the well - known and experimentally successful weinberg @xmath71 scattering lengths@xcite @xmath72    however , when one attempts to go beyond tree level in order to unitarize the results , divergences arise and that is where the field stopped at the end of the 1960 s . the solution ,",
    "as pointed out ten years later by weinberg@xcite and carried out by gasser and leutwyler@xcite , is to absorb these divergences in phenomenological constants , just as done in qed .",
    "a new wrinkle in this case is that the theory is nonrenormalizabile in that the forms of the divergences are _ different _ from the terms that one started with .",
    "that means that the form of the counterterms that are used to absorb these divergences must also be different , and gasser and leutwyler wrote down the most general counterterm lagrangian that one can have at one loop , which involves _ four - derivative _ interactions @xmath73 ^ 2+l_2{\\rm tr } ( d_{\\mu}ud_{\\nu}u^{\\dagger})\\cdot { \\rm tr } ( d^{\\mu}ud^{\\nu}u^{\\dagger } ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + & l_3{\\rm tr } ( d_{\\mu}u d^{\\mu}u^{\\dagger } d_{\\nu}u d^{\\nu}u^{\\dagger } ) + l_4 { \\rm tr }   ( d_{\\mu}u d^{\\mu}u^{\\dagger } ) { \\rm tr } ( \\chi{u^{\\dagger}}+u{\\chi}^{\\dagger } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & l_5{\\rm tr } \\left(d_{\\mu}u d^{\\mu}u^{\\dagger } \\left(\\chi u^{\\dagger}+u \\chi^{\\dagger}\\right ) \\right)+l_6\\bigg [ { \\rm tr } \\left(\\chi u^{\\dagger}+ u \\chi^{\\dagger}\\right)\\bigg]^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & l_7\\bigg [ { \\rm tr } \\left(\\chi^{\\dagger}u- u\\chi^{\\dagger}\\right)\\bigg]^2 + l_8 { \\rm tr } \\left(\\chi u^{\\dagger}\\chi u^{\\dagger } + u \\chi^{\\dagger } u\\chi^{\\dagger}\\right)\\nonumber \\\\ & + & il_9 { \\rm tr } \\left(f^l_{\\mu\\nu}d^{\\mu}u d^{\\nu } u^{\\dagger}+f^r_{\\mu\\nu}d^{\\mu } u^{\\dagger } d^{\\nu } u \\right ) + l_{10 } { \\rm tr}\\left(f^l_{\\mu\\nu } u f^{r\\mu\\nu}u^{\\dagger}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the covariant derivative is defined via @xmath74\\ ] ] the constants @xmath75 are arbitrary ( not determined from chiral symmetry alone ) and @xmath76 are external field strength tensors defined via @xmath77,\\qquad f^{l , r}_\\mu = v_\\mu\\pm a_\\mu .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now just as in the case of qed the bare parameters @xmath78 which appear in this lagrangian are not physical quantities .",
    "instead the experimentally relevant ( renormalized ) values of these parameters are obtained by appending to these bare values the divergent one - loop contributions @xmath79\\ ] ] by comparing predictions with experiment , gasser and leutwyler were able to determine empirical values for each of these ten parameters .",
    "typical results are shown in table 1 , together with the way in which they were determined .",
    ".gasser - leutwyler counterterms and the means by which they are determined .",

    "neither of these are straightforward although some limited data already exist@xcite .",
    "our final example involves an experiment at bates  measurement of the _ generalized _ proton _ polarizability _ via virtual compton scattering . first recall from section 2 the concept of polarizability as the constant of proportionality between an applied electric or magnetizing field and the resultant induced electric or magnetic dipole moment @xmath83",

    "the virtual compton scattering process@xmath89 can provide a measurement of the @xmath88-dependent electric and magnetic polarizabilities , whose fourier transform provides a picture of the _ local polarization density _ within the proton . on the theoretical side",
    "our group has performed a one loop hb@xmath0pt calculation and has produced a closed from expression for the predicted polarizabilities@xcite @xmath90 in the electric case the structure is about what would be expected  a gradual falloff of @xmath91 from the real photon point with scale @xmath92 . however , the magnetic generalized polarizability is predicted to _ rise _ before this general falloff occurs ",
    "chiral symmetry requires the presence of both a paramagnetic and a diamagnetic component to the proton .",
    "both predictions have received some support in a soon to be announced ( and tour de force ) mami measurement at @xmath93 mev@xcite . however , since parallel kinematics were employed in the experiment the desired generalized polarizabilities had to be identified on top of an enormous bethe - heitler background .",
    "the bates measurement , to be performed by the oops collaboration next spring , will take place at @xmath94 mev and will use the cababilities of the oops detector system to provide a 90 degree out of plane measurement , which should be _ much _ less sensitive to the bethe - heitler blowtorch .",
    "we anxiously await the results .",
    "in a short paper it is not possible to give any sense of the range of phenomena to which the concept of effective field theory as manifested via chiral perturbation theory has been applied , and interested readers can find many further applications in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have tried to convey the relatively direct connection of such predictions to the underlying qcd interaction and the feature that in this way qcd itself can be tested at bates .",
