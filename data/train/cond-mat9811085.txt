    "unlike polymers in the much studied dense and dilute phases @xcite , two - dimensional polymers in the compact phase exhibit a remarkable lack of universality .",
    "namely , their scaling properties are described by conformal field theories that depend crucially on the coordination number of the underlying lattice .",
    "this leads to an unusual situation where critical exponents for compact polymers on the square and the honeycomb lattice are different @xcite .",
    "another intriguing property of compact polymers , which by definition cover _ all _ the lattice sites , is that they constitute new universality classes that differ from that of dense polymers @xcite , for which the fraction of covered sites @xmath3 . in the dilute phase , which corresponds to a polymer in a good solvent , @xmath4 .",
    "the difference between compact and dense polymers is easily understood from the random surface perspective .",
    "namely , two - dimensional polymers can be mapped to a lattice model of a fluctuating interface which is described in the scaling limit by a liouville field theory with imaginary couplings . however , whilst the dense and dilute phases are both adequately described by a scalar height , the fully - packing ( or hamiltonian ) constraint imposed on compact polymers forces the height space to be @xmath5-dimensional , @xmath6 being the coordination number of the lattice at hand .",
    "the larger dimensionality of the height space leads to a more complicated effective field theory and to new exponents @xcite .    nonetheless , certain critical exponents turn out to be `` super - universal '' , in the sense that they are identical for dense polymers and compact polymers on the square and honeycomb lattice .",
    "consider the exponents @xmath7 , for @xmath8 , governing the power - law decay of the correlation function @xmath9 which describes @xmath10 polymer chains with one end anchored within a small region centred around the origin , and the other in a region around a distant point @xmath11 .",
    "a comparison of the explicit expressions for these so - called _ string _ ( or _ watermelon _ ) dimensions for the three models under consideration reveals that they are the same for @xmath10 even .",
    "this is also true of the difference @xmath12 between any two odd string dimensions .",
    "these observations have important consequences for the physically relevant _",
    "contact exponents _ @xmath13 .",
    "these exponents determine the asymptotic decay of the probability @xmath14 as @xmath15 , that a certain number of points on the polymer separated by macroscopic distances _ along _ the chain , simultaneously have a spatial separation of order @xmath16 ; the arrangement of contact points is specified by the graph @xmath17 . restricting for simplicity the attention to two - point contacts",
    ", it is easily seen that @xmath13 only depends on the string dimensions through the universal combinations @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as long as only interior points and at most one of the endpoints of the polymer are involved in the contact . on the other hand , contacts involving _ both _",
    "endpoints give rise to exponents that depend on @xmath20 separately , and hence are not universal .",
    "incidentally , @xmath20 also determines the conformational exponent @xmath21 , which describes the scaling of the ratio of the number of open to closed polymer chains with their length , and is a measure of the effective entropic interaction between the two polymer ends . for compact polymers on the honeycomb lattice the mean - field @xcite result @xmath22",
    "was found @xcite , whereas both compact polymers on the square lattice and dense polymers exhibit an effective entropic repulsion between chain ends with @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively @xcite .",
    "this paper aims at providing a theory of the transition from the compact to the dense phase , with emphasis on the mechanism that restores the universality of the string dimensions when violations of the fully - packing constraint are permitted .",
    "a particularly interesting framework for these investigations is an extension of the square - lattice model which was used to solve the compact polymer problem in ref .",
    "namely , this model allows for the definition of _ two _ mutually excluding flavours ( species ) of polymers , which in the compact case were found to interact in a manner that endowed the model with a two - dimensional manifold of critical fixed points .",
    "apart from the obvious interest in examining what happens to the liouville field theory as one flows away from the compact phase , it is a most beguiling question whether the dense and dilute phases also allow for a two - flavour extension .",
    "we shall find the answer to this question to be affirmative , with an important caveat : once vertices are allowed to be uncovered by the polymers , the two flavours _",
    "quite remarkably , this decoupling turns out to be so complete that one of the flavours may even flow to the dilute phase whilst the other remains dense !",
    "this provides a rationalisation for four of the five critical branches of the o(@xmath25 ) model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we begin ( in section  [ sec : plasma ] ) by giving a heuristic argument , based on the field theory for the compact phase , that explains how dense exponents may emerge from the compact ones when we allow for violations of the @xmath26 constraint . in the coulomb gas formalism string dimensions such as the ones defined above",
    "are determined by inserting a pair of electromagnetic test charges into the vacuum , and calculating their interaction energy .",
    "violations of the compactness constraint are shown to correspond to magnetic charges which form a plasma that completely screens _ one _ of the components of the vector magnetic charge of the test particles . as a result",
    "the compact string dimensions reduce to those of two non - interacting flavours of dense polymers .    though physically appealing this argument is unsound .",
    "we therefore go on ( in section [ sec : dpl2 ] ) to propose a lattice model that exhibits all three phases of polymers  compact , dense , and dilute .",
    "exact values of the central charge and the critical exponents are then computed from a coulomb gas construction which , although not mathematically rigorous , is well founded in the renormalisation group @xcite .",
    "these results neatly confirm the more intuitive magnetic plasma picture , and go further in describing the interplay between the dense and dilute phase .",
    "even though the two - flavoured model on the square lattice is our prime concern , the ideas presented here are quite general .",
    "in particular they apply to the one - flavoured model on the honeycomb lattice , and in general to loop models defined on arbitrary @xmath6-fold coordinated regular lattices .",
    "this is the subject of the discussion ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) , where we also elaborate on the relation between our results and those obtained for the o(@xmath25 ) model of ref .",
    "in ref .  @xcite scaling properties of compact polymers on the square lattice were investigated with the help of the two - flavour fully packed loop ( fpl@xmath2 ) model .",
    "this model has a two - dimensional region of critical fixed points wherein compact polymers are identified with a single point ; this point also belongs to a line of fixed points which is a subset of the critical manifold and it describes interacting compact polymers . since our results for the compact - to - dense transition extend to the entire critical manifold we shall begin by briefly reviewing the fpl@xmath2 model .",
    "first define @xmath27 to be the set of all _ edge colourings _ of the square lattice with four different colours .",
    "in other words , each edge of the lattice is assigned a colour @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 , subject to the constraint that for any vertex all of its four adjacant edges carry different colours .",
    "if we bipartition the square lattice into even and odd sublattices , directed _ loops _ of two different flavours ( `` black '' and `` grey '' ) can be defined as follows : colour @xmath28 designates a black loop segment directed from an even to an odd site , and colour @xmath29 corresponds to a black loop segment having the opposite direction .",
    "similarly colours @xmath30 and @xmath31 are used to define directed grey loops . by @xmath17",
    "we denote the equivalence classes of @xmath27 with respect to independent changes of directions for each of the loops .",
    "the fpl@xmath32 partition function is then @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the fugacities and @xmath35 the numbers of ( undirected ) black and grey loops in @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the model ( [ fpl2 ] ) is critical on the manifold @xmath36 , and the compact polymer problem discussed in the introduction is recovered in the limit @xmath37 .",
    "the extra orientational information present in @xmath27 allows for a local redistribution of the loop fugacities .",
    "indeed , assign a phase factor @xmath38 to each vertex where a directed black loop makes a right ( left ) turn , and the factor @xmath39 if it continues straight . in this way",
    "the weight of the entire black loop becomes @xmath40 if the orientation is clockwise ( counter - clockwise ) .",
    "the undirected loop weight @xmath41 is obtained by summing over the two orientations , whence @xmath42 . with a similar convention for the grey loops , and letting @xmath43 be the product of the local black and grey weights at the vertex @xmath44 , the partition function , eq .",
    "( [ fpl2 ] ) , can now be rewritten as @xmath45    the continuum limit of the fpl@xmath32 model is obtained by mapping the oriented loop configurations to an interface model defined on the dual lattice .",
    "the microscopic heights @xmath46 live on the plaquettes of the square lattice and they are defined , up to an overall shift , by the edge colours which stipulate the height differences between neighbouring plaquettes .",
    "more precisely , when encircling an even ( odd ) site in the clockwise direction a vector @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 is added to ( subtracted from ) @xmath46 depending on the state of the edge being crossed .",
    "the fully - packing constraint imposes the condition @xmath47 whence the colour vectors are three - dimensional .",
    "a suitable representation is @xmath48 the continuum limit is then taken by coarse graining @xmath46 .",
    "the effective field theory is described by a liouville action containing three terms @xcite : @xmath49 the elastic part @xmath50 is a gradient - squared term in the coarse grained height @xmath51 , and it controls the fluctuations of the interface away from flat configurations .",
    "the boundary term @xmath52 assigns the correct weights to loops winding around the point at infinity by coupling @xmath53 to the scalar curvature @xmath54 . finally , @xmath55 is a liouville potential that assigns the correct weights to loops in the bulk , and it is the coarse grained version of the microscopic vertex weights @xmath43 .    in the dual coulomb gas picture",
    "the action , eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) , is interpreted as that of a two - dimensional gas of electro - magnetic vector charges interacting via a logarithmic potential .",
    "electric charges are associated with vertex operators @xmath56 which appear as the scaling limits of fpl@xmath32 operators that can be expressed as local , periodic functions of the microscopic heights .",
    "magnetic charges @xmath57 act as non - local constraints on the height field , and they are associated with topological defects in the microscopic heights or , equivalently , with violations of the four - colouring constraint .",
    "finally , the curvature term @xmath52 introduces a background electric charge @xmath58 at the boundary of the system . for reasons of neutrality",
    "this endows the coulomb gas vacuum with a floating charge @xmath59 located in the bulk of the system .",
    "following the standard coulomb gas recipe @xcite , the calculation of the scaling dimension of an electromagnetic operator reduces to the determination of the interaction energy of `` test particles '' of charge @xmath60 inserted into the vacuum .",
    "this energy varies logarithmically with separation , where the prefactor of the logarithm is twice the sought dimension .",
    "as the floating charge is free to move around the bulk it will coalesce with one of the test particles thus minimising the energy .",
    "therefore the interaction energy consists of three terms associated with the pairwise interactions of the background electric charge @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , with the vacuum energy subtracted off .",
    "the energy of the vacuum is simply due to the pair interaction between the background charge and the floating charge .",
    "consider , for example , the computation of the string dimensions @xmath7 for the fpl@xmath32 model . since the defect strings may now have any of the two flavour labels this generalises to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) denotes the number of black ( grey ) strings .",
    "for dislocations generated in the bulk the number @xmath67 must be even @xcite .",
    "appropriate defect configurations may be specified through the colouring state of the four edges around some fixed vertex @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xmath68 generates two directed black strings and corresponds to a height vortex of strength @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , @xmath70 is a vortex of strength @xmath71 that generates two grey strings , and @xmath72 generates one string of either flavour and has strength @xmath73 . for simplicity we shall concentrate on the black strings and define @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "the defect magnetic charge @xmath76 found as a suitable linear combination of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , must be accompanied by an appropriate compensating electric charge that takes care of the spurious phase factors arising from the winding of the strings around the defect cores @xcite . setting the fugacity of the grey strings equal to unity ( @xmath79 ) we obtain the following result for the scaling dimensions : @xmath80 as mentioned in the introduction the even scaling dimensions agree with those of dense polymers @xcite ( and also with those of the fully - packed loop model on the honeycomb lattice @xcite ) , whereas the odd dimensions contain an extra term due to the coupling between the black and the grey strings .",
    "so far our discussion has been for the fully - packed case where a fraction @xmath26 of the lattice vertices are visited by both loop flavours .",
    "now consider moving infinitesimally into the dense phase by diminishing the fraction of visited vertices to @xmath81 .",
    "one can imagine doing so by distributing a fraction @xmath82 of @xmath83 defects and a fraction @xmath82 of @xmath84 defects throughout the system .",
    "the corresponding vortices have magnetic charge @xmath85 , where @xmath86 physically this situation corresponds to having a dilute magnetic plasma superimposed on the coulomb gas vacuum .    as before we can then imagine inserting two electromagnetic test particles of charge @xmath60 into the system in order to measure the string scaling dimensions .",
    "just as in the familiar case of electric test particles in a dielectric medium there will now be some screening , the difference being that here it is the magnetic charge that is being screened .",
    "however , unlike what is the case in this dielectric analogy , the magnetic plasma is completely free to move around , and the screening will be complete .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the magnetic charges in are _ relevant _ , i.e. their scaling dimension @xcite 2 x(_t ) = 4   is less than 2 on the whole critical manifold of the 2 model .",
    "therefore these charges are not bound into vortex - antivortex pairs at large scales @xcite .",
    "taking our cue from this intuitive picture we hypothesise that the effect of the magnetic plasma can be modeled by the substitution @xmath87 since the only non - vanishing component of the screening charge ( [ m_t ] ) is along the 2-direction , and this does not couple to any of the other directions . in particular , replacing @xmath88 of eq .",
    "( [ m_s ] ) by @xmath89 we find that instead of eq .",
    "( [ x_compact ] ) we get @xmath90 for all @xmath10 , whether even or odd !",
    "it seems that the interaction between the two loop flavours that was responsible for the difference between the even and odd string dimensions in eq .",
    "( [ x_compact ] ) has somehow been disposed of , and what remains is the critical exponents of _ dense _ polymers @xcite",
    ".    one can proceed to compute the central charge for the screened system .",
    "we recall that in the compact ( @xmath26 ) case this was given as @xmath91 , where the three free bosons present in @xmath50 each contribute unit central charge , and there is a negative shift due to the background electric charge .",
    "however , since the magnetic charges live in height space the complete screening of @xmath92 means that height fluctuations along the 2-direction are frozen out .",
    "this is nothing but the usual kosterlitz - thouless scenario @xcite , where due to the unbinding of dislocations the interface defined by the second height component is rendered smooth . as a result the central charge for @xmath93 is @xmath94 , which can be written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is nothing but the central charge of one flavour of dense polymers @xcite .",
    "if we again set the fugacity of the grey loops equal to unity ( @xmath79 ) we find that @xmath97 , and only the contribution from the black loops remains . the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] )",
    "should be taken as a further indication that once we allow for violations of the fully - packing constraint the two loop flavours decouple .    at this point , of course , a number of objections may be raised .",
    "first , it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ m_s ] ) that the magnitude of the magnetic charge along the 2-direction is @xmath98 .",
    "however , for the screening to take place it then seems that the magnetic screening charges @xmath85 given by eq .",
    "( [ m_t ] ) must somehow be fractionalised .",
    "another objection is that the above calculation , when taken at face value , purports to be perturbative around the fully - packed phase .",
    "however , as pointed out earlier [ ] the defect operators within the fpl@xmath32 model are strongly relevant !",
    "this means that the fugacity of these defects will flow off to infinity at large scales .",
    "hence , the magnetic plasma analogy is no more than a heuristic argument .",
    "nevertheless , we shall see in the following section that it is possible to generalise the fpl@xmath32 model to a lattice model that explicitly accommodates configurations that are not fully packed . in this generalised model coulomb gas calculations",
    "can be carried out , confirming the main results found in this section .",
    "even when accepting the magnetic plasma analogy as a heuristic framework for treating the case of @xmath99 , the fpl@xmath32 height mapping on which it is based breaks down completely for @xmath100 .",
    "it is therefore impossible to say anything about the role of the dilute polymer phase .",
    "however , from the calculations presented in the next section we shall be able to say more about how dilute exponents may emerge .",
    "in order to unify our understanding of compact , dense and dilute polymers as well as their possible interrelation we introduce a statistical mechanics model that can accommodate all three phases . since the critical properties of the compact phase are known to be lattice dependent we need to consider the model on a specific lattice . to examine the important issues associated with the presence of more than one loop flavour we choose the square lattice , whereas the question of what the construction would look like on other lattices is deferred to the discussion .",
    "= 8.6 cm    we therefore define the _ two - flavour densely packed loop _ ( dpl@xmath32 ) _ model _ on the square lattice by listing its ten allowed vertex states in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertices ] . the first six vertices are those familiar from the fully packed ( fpl@xmath32 ) case , whilst the last four vertices explicitly allow the model to violate the fully - packing constraint .",
    "vertices 78 exclude the grey loops from a given site and carry a weight @xmath101 , and similarly vertices 910 exclude the black loops and have weight @xmath102 .",
    "the first six vertices are all assigned unit weight .",
    "the partition function of the dpl@xmath32 model is then @xmath103 where @xmath104 have the same meaning as in eq .",
    "( [ fpl2 ] ) , and @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the number of occurrences of vertices 78 and 910 , respectively .",
    "the summation runs over the set @xmath107 of loop configurations on the square lattice that can be made out of vertices 110 , subject to the constraint that both flavours form closed loops .",
    "this model is closely related to the o(@xmath25 ) model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for which five branches of critical points were found as a function of @xmath25 . in the discussion we shall comment on the precise relation of the 2 model to this one , thus providing a physical picture of its critical properties .",

    "furthermore , one may suspect that if the bare value of @xmath101 is very large the grey loops flow to the dilute phase .",
    "this is indeed the case , and we shall see below how this mechanism is implemented in the coulomb gas construction . ] ! of course , all along our working assumption is that the scaling limit of the 2 model exists for loop fugacities @xmath119 .",
    "an ideal state of a loop model has two distinguishing features .",
    "first , it is macroscopically flat , so that fluctuations of the interface around the ideal states can be controlled by an elastic term @xmath50 in the effective action .",
    "second , it is entropically selected in the sense that it maximises the number of configurations which differ from it by the smallest allowed change . to be concrete consider the directed fpl@xmath32 model in the four - colouring representation .",
    "since any change of a configuration must necessarily involve the change of some edge colour @xmath120 into another colour @xmath121 , it follows that the whole loop @xmath122 defined as an alternating sequence of these two colours must be changed into @xmath123 .",
    "an ideal state allows for the maximum number of such _ loop flips _ , and consequently has a maximum number of small loops of alternating colour .",

    "namely , for each of the 16 states exemplified by fig .  [ fig : id - states].a  b there corresponds another ideal state where only one of the two loop flavours is used to form the small loops .",

    "[ fig : ambiguity ] in the process of tracing out the loop @xmath122 to be flipped . in that case one has two equivalent choices for proceding .",

    "if we focus for a moment on the central charge of the 2 model along the line @xmath216 , it is equal to the central charge of the black loops plus the central charge of the grey loops ; see .",
    "the contribution of the grey loops to the central charge is @xmath217 or @xmath218 depending on whether they are in the dense or the dilute phase ; this , of course , is determined by the choice of vertex weights .",

    "this is born out by the numerics , but the correspondence seems to break down for smaller values of the black loop weight .",
