    "type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) provide an important contribution of iron to the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "because of this , the rate of sn ia explosions , and its secular evolution are fundamental for understanding abundances and abundance patterns in stellar systems , in galaxy clusters and in the intergalactic medium . due to the high energy release of each event , the rate of sn ia explosions also impacts on",
    "the evolution of gas flows in elliptical galaxies @xcite , and on the feedback process which follows from an episode of star formation ( sf ) .",
    "the rate of nucleosynthetic and energetic input from sn ia s critically depend on the distribution of the delay times ( dtd ) , the delay time being the time elapsed between the birth of the sn ia progenitor star and its final explosion . in the current literature ,",
    "the shape of the dtd is still considerably debated ( see @xcite and references therein ) , partly because the sn ia progenitor s have not been unequivocally identified .",
    "most notably , type ia supernovae are crucial cosmological probes , e.g. having provided the first evidence for cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "their use in cosmology is subject to the _ standardisation _ of their light curve , i.e. the ability to relate a distance independent quantity to the absolute magnitude at maximum light .",
    "for example , the phillips relation links the sn ia magnitude at maximum ( e.g. @xmath0 ) to its dimming in the first 15 days after maximum ( @xmath1 , a measure of the decline rate ) @xcite . while the relation very likely reflects different production of radioactive @xmath2  in the explosion @xcite , the physical mechanism which causes this diversity is not clear , nor is the reason for the observed dispersion of the relation , part of which could be of intrinsic origin . in most practical applications",
    "the _ standardisation _ of the sn ia light curves involves the use of the _ stretch _ parameter ( @xmath3,@xcite ) , which is related to the width of the light curve and the magnitude at maximum light , based on observational data .",
    "therefore , at present , the _ standardisation _ of the sn ia light curves is fully empirical , and based on events at low redshift : if a systematic different relation holds for high @xmath4 events ( either in the average value , or in the dispersion , or both ) the cosmological application of sn ia s as distance indicators would be called into question .",
    "big , homogeneous samples of nearby events are currently being constructed , from which robust correlations can be derived , and peculiar events single out ( e.g. @xcite ) , but ultimately , we want to assess whether the sn ia light curve _ stretching _ works in the same way at high and low redshift .",
    "it is then foremost important to understand the diversity of sn ia events , and to check whether this is related to parameters like age and metallicity , which both increase systematically from high to low redshift .",
    "several observational attempts have been performed to clarify this issue .",
    "a relation between the @xmath2  mass and the metallicity of the progenitor is expected on the basis of the nucleosynthetic processing @xcite ; this prediction has been studied by trying to determine the metallicity of individual progenitors ( e.g. @xcite ) , as well as that of the stellar population hosts @xcite .",
    "so far the results are not conclusive , and metallicity does not appear to be the most important parameter driving the diversity ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "in this respect , it is worth noting that a sizable fraction of mass in stars in the local universe belongs to populations that are both old and metal rich ( @xcite and references therein ) ; therefore also at high redshift an important fraction of sn ia events come from high metallicity stars . thus ,",
    "unless the metallicity dependence of the sn ia light curve is very pronounced , the trend of its properties with redshift related to the change of ( average ) metalliticy should be weak .",
    "more significant are the empirical correlations found between the light curves and the youth of the galaxy host .",
    "literature results include the average @xmath1  being higher in later galaxy types @xcite ; brightest events occurring preferentially ( if not only ) in hosts with high sf rate per unit mass @xcite ; a correlation between the @xmath2  mass and the average age of the sn ia host , with only faint events in galaxies with average ages older than @xmath5 3 gyr @xcite .",
    "the observed trends all point in the same direction , i.e. the younger the stellar population the more energetic its sn ia , but the details differ .",
    "for example , @xcite find that sn ia s in galaxies with high specific sf span a narrow range in v magnitude at maximum , while the diversity is much more pronounced at low specific sf .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite find a wide range of @xmath2mass in events hosted by young stellar populations , which suggests that diversity is a feature of star forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite find a wide range of sn ia light curve properties in both early and late type galaxies ; @xcite find that faint events occur only in high mass galaxies , suggestive of a uniformity of sn ia s in old stellar populations .",
    "likely , the picture is confused because different authors use different proxies to characterise the light curve of sn ia s ( stretch parameter , @xmath1 , magnitude at maximum in some photometric band , ejected @xmath2 ) , and the age of the parent stellar population ( light or mass averaged age , spectral indices , morphological type ) .",
    "the empirical route to study this issue is further complicated by the effect of extinction which is difficult to correct for in the individual events ( e.g. @xcite ) .    from the conjectural point of view",
    ", the claim of two populations for sn ia s @xcite , one ( _ prompt _ ) supplying events within the first 0.1 gyr from the sf episode , and one ( _ tardy _ ) providing explosions over the whole remaining age range ( but with a much lower efficiency ) has suggested the existence of two distinct channels for sn ia production , possibly characterised by different light curve parameters . since at high redshift",
    "the sn ia production via the _ prompt _ channel must prevail , a systematic evolution of the phillips relation could be present , related to the change of mixture of _ prompt _ and _ tardy _ explosions .    from the stellar evolution point of view , while it is generally agreed that sn ia explosions are due to the ignition of fuel in co white dwarfs ( wd ) , the specific path to the successful event is still debated .",
    "the lack of hydrogen lines in most sn ia spectra has traditionally lead to exclude single stars ( at the end of their evolution on the asymptotic giant branch ) as viable candidates for sn ia s .",
    "the explosion of a ( naked ) wd may be obtained via accretion from a close companion in a binary system , either as a consequence of helium detonation , when the accreted he layer reaches a critical mass ( sub - chandrassekhar models , hereinafter sub - chandra ) , or of carbon deflagration , when the co wd reaches the chandrassekhar mass ( hereinafter chandra ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "different progenitor models correspond to different companions of the wd , which can be non degenerate ( ms or post ms ) or degenerate stars ( another wd ) ; the relative evolutionary channels are commonly known as single ( sd ) and double degenerate ( dd ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , stellar evolution in a close binary system does provide two different channels for sn ia production , and also two different kinds of explosion . in each case ,",
    "though , the range of delay times can be very wide , from @xmath5 40 myr ( the lifetime of an 8 @xmath6  star , i.e. @xmath5 the most massive co wd progenitor ) up to a hubble time , so that each channel can accommodate _",
    "prompt _ and _ tardy _ events . at the same time , a systematic variation of the exploding wd parameters ( e.g. the range of initial mass of the primary in successful systems ) with the delay time is expected within each channel , and this could account for the observed diversity , as well as imply correlations with the age of the parent stellar population .    from the observational point of view , there is no clear indication decisively supporting one channel over the other . the circumstellar material detected for the event sn 2006x @xcite has been interpreted as favouring the single degenerate model , while the lack of it in other events is more easily understood within the double degenerate model ( see @xcite ) . according to @xcite theoretical computations ,",
    "the presence of a companion should cause an excess emission in the early light curve , which originates from the collision of the ejecta with the companion .",
    "the phenomenon , which should be detectable for @xmath5 10 % of the sd events , has not been reported so far , and provides a very interesting test of the progenitor model .",
    "statistics of potential progenitors for the two models is also not conclusive . on the one hand",
    "there are many types of interacting binaries containing a wd plus a non degenerate star @xcite , like cataclismic binaries , symbiotic systems and the particularly promising class of supersoft x - ray sources , but it s not clear whether the population of good candidate sn ia precursors among them is abundant enough to account for the observed sn ia rate @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the inventory of close double degenerates from the spy project did yield one system with total mass larger than the chandrassekhar limit and close enough to merge within a hubble time @xcite , showing that potential sn ia progenitors can be found among dds as well .",
    "a few events have been reported to require a super - chandrassekhar wd mass @xcite : these are more easily explained as dd mergers .",
    "meanwhile , single degenerate systems containing a wd with mass close to the chandrassekhar limit have been discovered , like rs oph @xcite and hd 49798/rx j648.0 - 4418 @xcite , which are very good candidate sn ia precursors .",
    "these evidences may well suggest that both channels are providing snia events with comparable efficiency .    in this paper",
    "some general features of the dtd which are expected from stellar evolution in close binaries are illustrated , following the analytical parametrisation presented in @xcite ( paper i ) , and described in sect .",
    "the dependence of the dtd on the major parameters is considered next , focusing on the possibility of realising strong discontinuities which may justify the concept of _ prompt _ and _ tardy _ events . the systematic variation with the delay time of some properties of the progenitors ( i.e. wd cooling times , mass of the co wd at the start of accretion , total mass of the dd systems ) is also examined .",
    "these two aspects impact on the possibility of systematic differences between low and high redshift samples of sn ia , and are discussed in sect .",
    "3 , separately for sd and dd models . mixed ( sd + dd ) dtd models are presented in sect .",
    "4 , where the possibility of constraining the mix from the observations is discussed .",
    "the results are summarised and discussed in sect .",
    "5 ; conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "the standard evolutionary scenario to sn ia explosion starts with a close binary system in which the primary is an intermediate mass star , so that the first roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) leaves a co wd .",
    "low mass stars ( @xmath7 ) do produce co wds , but in a close binary they can do so only if the first mass exchange takes place after the he flash . since the stellar radii at he flash are large ( hundreds of solar radii ) , and since the distribution of the original separations @xmath8 scales as 1/@xmath8 , in most cases low mass primaries in close binary systems will fill their roche lobe ( rl ) while on the first red giant branch , thereby producing helium , rather than co , wds .",
    "therefore , reasonable limits to the primary mass ( @xmath9 ) in sn ia progenitor systems are 2 and 8 @xmath6 . when the secondary fills its rl there are two possibilities : either the co wd accretes and burns the hydrogen rich material remaining compact inside its rl , or a common envelope ( ce ) forms around the two stars . in the first case",
    ", the wd grows in mass and when conditions are met , a sn ia explosion occurs ; in the second case , due to the action of a frictional drag force , the ce is eventually expelled , while the binary system shrinks @xcite .",
    "if the secondary is relatively massive , the outcome of the ce is a co wd + helium star system .",
    "further evolution causes the he star to expand and fill its rl , pouring helium rich material on the companion , and the co wd has again the possibility of accreting and growing up to explosion conditions @xcite .",
    "both these paths to the sn ia event are sd channels , but in the first one ( h - rich sd channel ) some h is expected in the vicinity of the sn ia which may show up in the spectrum , while in the second one ( helium star channel ) no h - rich material should be around .    if the co wd does not accrete the donated helium , a ce phase sets in again , leading to a close co+co wd system .",
    "angular momentum losses via gravitational wave radiation will eventually lead the system to merge , and , if its total mass exceeds the chandrassekhar limit , explosion may arise .",
    "this is the dd channel to sn ia , as provided by intermediate mass binaries .",
    "a dd system may also be formed when the secondary is a low mass star , which fills its rl when its he core is degenerate . in this case",
    ", the ce phase leaves a close binary with one co and one he wd , but , typically , the total mass of the dd system does not reach the chandrassekhar limit @xcite . therefore this channel provides mainly sub - chandra events ; while potentially important for the sn ia s , especially at late delay times , this path is neglected here because sub - chandra explosions do not provide a good fit to light curves and spectra of the majority of sn ia s @xcite .    upon specifications of the distribution of the initial parameters ( @xmath9,@xmath10 , @xmath8 ) ,",
    "binary population synthesis ( bps ) codes compute the evolution of a population of binaries through these complicated paths , determine the partition of the population in the various channels , and the delay times of the explosions .",
    "the results are sensitive to the recipes used to follow the evolution , most notably the criteria to decide what happens when a star fills its rl .",
    "critical prescriptions regard the occurrence of ce or not , the outcome of mass exchange , the accretion modalities on the wd , whether fuel ignition leads to accretion induced collapse or to a thermonuclear explosion @xcite .",
    "the dtd from simulations may present discontinuities due to the switch on / off of one of the channels , and/or to an abrupt variation of the efficiency with which one channel is providing sn ia s , as a function of the original binary parameters .",
    "for example , a narrow dtd , centred on a characteristic delay time , can be produced by suppressing all but one of the channels , and narrowing the range of the progenitor masses .",
    "these ( putative ) discontinuities , and their location in delay time , follow from the prescriptions adopted in the bps code .",
    "many of the parameters which need to be specified are very poorly constrained ( e.g. the efficiency @xmath11  of the ce phase which controls the degree of shrinkage of the system ) ; therefore the specific realisations can be _ up to date _ , but remain uncertain .    an alternative approach to derive the dtd of sn ia explosions consists in characterising its shape using general stellar evolution arguments , and introducing a parametrisation of a few astrophysical variables believed to play an important role .",
    "this approach was followed by @xcite for the sd channel , improved in @xcite to accommodate sub - chandra explosions , and further developed in paper i , where analytic functions for the dtd are derived for both the sd and the dd channels .",
    "compared to the numerical results from bps , these functions provide a more flexible tool to investigate on the predictions from different progenitor models on various observables , thereby offering a way to constrain those astrophysical parameters which are recognised as crucial . on the other hand , in order to derive the analytic functions , some approximations and assumptions have to be made , which are summarised in the following .",
    "we refer the reader to paper i for the detailed derivation of the analytic dtds .",
    "regardless the specific path , the delay time for sd channels is very close to the evolutionary lifetime of the secondary star off the ms ( @xmath12(@xmath10 ) ) : for the h - rich sd explosion the extra time spent to reach the rl dimensions , and the accretion timescale during which the co wd grows to ignition conditions are both much smaller than @xmath12(@xmath10 ) . for the helium star channel , some correction ( of about 10% ) should be applied to account for the he burning lifetime of the former secondary ; in practise however @xmath12(@xmath10 ) fairly represents the total delay time also in this case .",
    "therefore , for the sd channel there is a one to one correspondence between the mass of the secondary and the delay time , so that the distribution of the delay times is :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the distribution of the secondary masses in systems which provide successful explosions through this channel , and @xmath15 is the rate of change of the stellar mass evolving off the main sequence .",
    "the latter factor is a robust prediction of stellar evolution theory ; the first factor can be derived analytically by convolving the distribution of primary masses with the distribution of the mass ratios ( @xmath16 ) in binary systems .",
    "if all sn ia s where arising from this evolutionary path , the range spanned by @xmath10  should go from @xmath5 8 @xmath6  down to @xmath17 1 @xmath6 , to account for the wide range of delay times implied by sn ia events happening in all galaxy types @xcite .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ dtd_sd ] shows the dtd for the sd chandra channel under this hypothesis .",
    "the two cusps mark the setting in of two restrictions on the parameter space leading to explosion : the first corresponds to the minimum mass of the primary , which is set to 2 @xmath6  since the exploding wd should be composed of co , rather than he rich material .",
    "the later cusp is related to the requirement of totalling a chandrassekar mass to ensure explosion with a relatively low mass secondary : as the delay time grows long , the progressively lighter secondary ought to combine with a progressively heavier co wd ( hence heavier @xmath9 ) to meet the chandrassekhar limit . when the lower limit on @xmath9   becomes larger than 2 @xmath6  the second cusp occurs .",
    "this restriction does not apply to sub - chandra events ( dot - dashed line ) ; thus , in this case , the dtd presents only one cusp , motivated by the requirement of a minimum primary mass of 3 @xmath6  as suggested by the models in @xcite .",
    "a final remark concerns the wd + ms channel proposed by @xcite : in this model the companion fills its rl before core h exhaustion , and the delay time could be appreciably shorter than the evolutionary lifetime of the secondary .",
    "the derivation of an analytic dtd is hardly possible in this case , since the time at which rlof happens depends on the evolution of the binary separation as determined by several physical processes , e.g. ce evolution , magnetic braking , tidal interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the primary star still has to evolve and produce a co wd ; therefore , for a given system , the delay time will be comprised between the evolutionary lifetimes of the primary and that of the secondary .",
    "if accretion starts soon after the formation of the co wd , the distribution of the delay times will be given by eq.([eq_fiasd ] ) with @xmath9  replacing @xmath10 , i.e. the wd formation rate from the primary .",
    "if accretion is delayed until the secondary reaches core hydrogen exhaustion the dtd will be given by eq.([eq_fiasd ] ) .",
    "the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ dtd_sd ] shows the co wd formation rate ( arbitrarily shifted ) from primary stars with mass between 2 and 8 @xmath6 , having assumed a salpeter imf .",
    "we may expect that the dtd for the ms+wd channel has an intermediate slope between the dashed and the solid line , i.e. more skewed at the short delays compared to eq.([eq_fiasd ] ) , but not dramatically different .",
    "the delay time for the dd systems is the sum of the ms lifetime of the secondary ( @xmath12(@xmath10 ) , hereafter @xmath12 ) plus the time taken by the gravitational wave radiation to get the dd system into contact ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the latter time delay depends on the separation ( @xmath19 ) and masses of the components of the dd system at birth ; if both @xmath9  and @xmath10  are intermediate mass stars ( @xmath20 ) this delay can be approximated as @xmath21 , where @xmath22  is the total mass of the dd system , and both @xmath19  and @xmath22  are in solar units ( paper i ) .",
    "for what explained above , this limit on the masses of both binary components corresponds to considering co + co dd systems ; besides , the limit @xmath10@xmath23 2 @xmath6   implies a maximum delay @xmath12  of 1 gyr .",
    "the delay @xmath18 , plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ dtd_dd ] , is very sensitive to both @xmath19  and @xmath22 , and in principle it ranges from virtually zero , for the most massive / closest systems , up to infinity for the least massive / widest ones .",
    "fixed limits apply to @xmath22 , from 1.4@xmath6  ( chandra explosions ) to @xmath24 , when both components in the primordial system are of 8 @xmath6  star is assumed to be a co wd of 1.2 @xmath6 , consistent with the empirical relation in @xcite and in @xcite ] .",
    "more elusive is the allowed range for @xmath19 , although it must be smaller than @xmath25 in order to provide events within a hubble time .",
    "typically , the separation of the dd systems at birth is the result of evolution through at least 2 rlof episodes .",
    "given the difficulty of describing this complex hydrodynamical phase , the results of the application of the various recipes in the literature are uncertain . in this respect , it is important to notice that a substantial shrinkage is necessary to account for sn ia events within a hubble time from dd systems , since the first rlof occurs when the separation @xmath8ranges from several 10 @xmath26  ( to avoid premature merging ) , to several 100 @xmath26  ( to get rlof at all , see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the prescription used in bps codes to determine the degree of shrinkage should be accurate at a level of @xmath5 1 % to yield correct results on an individual binary .    the sensitivity of the ratio @xmath27 to the commonly adopted literature descriptions of the ce phase is explored in paper i. it appears that when the @xmath11  formalism @xcite is applied to two mass exchange phases , the ratio is very small , so that only initially wide systems manage to populate the relevant range of separations ( up to a few @xmath26 ) .",
    "conversely , if the first of the two ce phases is regulated by the @xcite ( angular momentum loss ) recipe , the ratio @xmath27 covers a @xmath5 2 orders of magnitude range , depending on the masses of the components .",
    "moreover , in the former case , the heavier the original binary the lower the @xmath27 ratio : this is because in the @xmath11  formalism the shrinkage at each ce phase is proportional to the binding energy of the envelope of the donor , which is larger when the donor is more massive .",
    "thus , the larger @xmath10 , the shorter @xmath12  _ and _ the shorter @xmath18 : this skews the dtd towards the short delay times .",
    "when the nelemans formalism is applied , instead , no strong relation appears to emerge between the initial masses of the binary components and the shrinkage , so that @xmath12  and @xmath18  are likely to be uncorrelated , as well as @xmath22  and @xmath19 .    on this premises , analytic distributions of the delay times for the dd channel",
    "have been derived in paper i in two flavours : the dd - close model , in which at each @xmath10  the delay time varies between a minimum ( = @xmath12(@xmath10 ) ) and a maximum delay , whose value increases as @xmath10  decreases . in this scenario , a wide portion of the initial parameter space ( @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath8 ) maps into short delay times , while the long delay times are populated with only the less massive binaries .",
    "the dd - wide model , instead , assumes that @xmath19  and @xmath22  are independent variables , and their distributions concur to shape the distribution of the gravitational wave radiation delay . the variables @xmath12  and @xmath18  are also assumed to be basically independent , except for a correlation between @xmath10  ( i.e. @xmath12 ) and @xmath22 , to account for the fact that the heavier the original secondary , the more massive the dd remnant . as a result , in the dd - wide channel",
    "the upper limit to @xmath18  is greater then the hubble time irrespective of the mass of the original binary , and the population at long delay times of the corresponding dtd is enhanced .",
    "simple power laws are assumed to describe the distribution of @xmath18  ( close dds ) and @xmath19  ( wide dds ) , with parametrised exponents respectively called @xmath28  and @xmath29 .",
    "the shape of the distribution of @xmath22  is found to be relatively unimportant .    admittedly , the above approximations and the assumptions are rough and do not punctually describe the outcome of the evolution of close binaries , sn ia progenitors .",
    "however , the range spanned by @xmath22  and @xmath19  for events within a hubble time are small , so that the assumption of smooth distributions of these parameters is likely appropriate .",
    "the main features of the curves are determined by the gravitational wave radiation clock , which implies that the distribution of @xmath18  is skewed at the short end , unless all successful dds are born very wide .",
    "this characteristic can be judged by projecting a flat distribution of @xmath19  into the corresponding distribution on @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ dtd_dd ] , left panel .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ dtd_dd ] shows the dtd for close dds and wide dds , normalised to 1 over the range of delay times up to 13 gyr .",
    "the distributions can be viewed as a modification of the sd case , where systems with given @xmath12   populate a range of delay times longer than this due to the extra delay @xmath18 .",
    "the wide dd case is the least populated at the short delay times , the close dd the most , since in this case the great majority of systems have a short @xmath18 .",
    "notice that delay times in excess of 1 gyr are populated only with systems whose @xmath18  is longer than some limit , since by construction a maximum @xmath12  of 1 gyr is imposed .",
    "this is the reason for the presence of the cusp in the dtds : at this delay time a fixed limit on the allowed parameter ( @xmath12 ) space is hit .",
    "although this feature in the analytic dtds is purely numerical , we do expect an abrupt change in the distribution at a delay time equal to the ms lifetime of the least massive secondary in successful sn ia progenitors .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ dtd_dd ] shows that the various models provide similar curves : the dtd features an early maximum and most events occur within @xmath5 1 gyr from formation . at",
    "later epochs the dtd exhibits a steady decline with a pronounced downturn for the sd chandra model .",
    "all distributions accommodate _ prompt _ and _ tardy _ events , but with a substantial continuity over the whole range of delay times ; this follows from the assumption of continuous distributions over the relevant parameter space of masses and separations of sn ia progenitors . in the next section these curves",
    "are compared with theoretical results in the literature .      in deriving the analytic dtds described above one potentially important variable",
    "is neglected , i.e. the separation of the primordial binary @xmath8 . in order to provide a successful event ,",
    "@xmath8  ought to range between a minimum and a maximum value , respectively to avoid premature merging , and secure interaction at all .",
    "as long as these limits do not depend on the component s masses , the shape of the dtd is not affected , and the limitation just reflects into the overall likelihood of the sn ia event from a stellar population . however",
    ", the minimum and maximum initial separations tend to increase with the mass of the primary , because more massive stars have larger radii at all key points along evolution .",
    "figures 1 to 4 in iben and tutukov ( 1987 ) well illustrate this point , also showing that , in general , the range of separations for a successful interaction widens as the primary mass grows .",
    "it the distribution of @xmath8  were flat , the more massive binaries would have then greater chance to provide sn ia s ; on the other hand , closer systems should be more abundant @xcite , so that the more massive binaries also have a higher likelihood of premature merging .",
    "therefore , it is not clear how the efficiency of sn ia production from a binary of given ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) varies with the system separation .",
    "the comparison of the analytic dtds with results from bps helps understanding whether or not the analytic functions capture the most important astrophysical parameters .    in paper",
    "i the analytic dtds are compared to the bps results of @xcite : consistency is found for the sub - chandra and for the dd - chandra cases , when accounting for the limits on @xmath9  and @xmath10  adopted by the authors .",
    "the comparison between the dtds of the sd - chandra channel is hampered by the narrowness of the range of secondary masses in systems which provide sn ia through the h - rich sd path in the @xcite simulations .",
    "actually , the conditions for stable mass transfer and/or a successful growth to the chandrassekhar limit of the h - accreting co wd are often found to hold only within a very restricted range of @xmath10 .",
    "the analytic dtds do not incorporate constraints on the mass transfer rate , but the mass range covered by the components of successful systems is to be considered as a parameter .",
    "@xcite present the dtd for the sd - chandra scenario taking into account the effect of a radiative wind from the accreting wd which stabilises the mass transfer @xcite , favouring the wd mass growth .",
    "although their computation is not a bps simulation , the dtd is obtained by integrating the distributions over the appropriate range in the parameter space ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath8 ) which leads to successful explosions , according to their modelling of the evolution of co wds accreting from a ms and from a rg companion .",
    "it is instructive to compare their derived dtd with the paper i analytical distributions .",
    "let s first consider the wd+rg channel : @xcite find it active for @xmath10@xmath17 3 @xmath6 , and indeed the corresponding dtd is populated at @xmath30@xmath31 0.4 gyr ; its dtd is marked by two cusps , at 1.6 and 12.6 gyr .",
    "given the wide bins of delay time in the @xcite computation , the position of the cusps are consistent with those on the solid line in fig .",
    "[ dtd_sd ] . for the same choice of imf ( salpeter ) and distribution of mass ratios ( flat ) as in fig .",
    "[ dtd_sd ] , the slope of the dtd between the two cusps ( in logarithmic units ) is -1.4 , perfectly consistent with the analytic dtd .",
    "the wd+ms channel is found active for 2 @xmath17 @xmath10/@xmath6@xmath17 6 and , in fact , the relative dtd goes to zero in the vicinity of @xmath30= 1 gyr ; the slope is @xmath5 -1.4 , much steeper than the slope of the wd formation rate ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ dtd_sd ] ) in the same range of delay times , which is @xmath5 -0.5 .",
    "this may signal that the distribution of the separations is important in shaping the dtd of the wd+ms channel , favouring sn ia events in the more massive binaries .",
    "the dtd from the wd+ms channel has also been presented by @xcite , as derived with their bps code .",
    "the resulting dtd is a rather narrow , almost flat distribution , within limits which depend on the parameter for ce efficiency .",
    "a similar shape is found for the wd+ms channel in @xcite .",
    "the limits are consistent with the ms lifetime of the most and least massive secondary in sn ia progenitors through this channel , which are found confined between @xmath5 3 and @xmath5 2 @xmath6 .",
    "these dtds are quite different from those in @xcite , possibly because of the use of a different technique and of different details in the assumptions .",
    "therefore , the shape of the dtd for the wd+ms channel seems rather sensitive to the adopted approach .",
    "dtds based on bps calculations have been presented by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "since the former models include sub - chandra explosions , which actually provided the majority of events @xcite , their comparison with the analytic dtds is not practical .",
    "more similar are the sn ia production channels in the models presented in @xcite , which include only chandra exploders , from dd progenitors ( dds ) , h - rich sd chandra progenitors ( sds ) , and co wds accreting helium via stable rlof , either from a non degenerate or from a degenerate companion ( am cvn ) .",
    "the dtd for the dds channel is very similar to the analytic function , with a logarithmic slope of @xmath32 - 1 .",
    "notice that when the efficiency of the ce phase is reduced ( @xmath11=0.5 ) the dtd of the dds channel is found steeper , as a consequence of the smaller orbital separations of the dd systems when they emerge from the ce .",
    "the same effect can be obtained by varying the parameter @xmath28  or @xmath29  in the analytic dtds .",
    "the comparison with the bps results for the sd channel is more complicated , due to its splitting into the two classes sds and am cvn in @xcite .",
    "however , the bps dtd seems much flatter than the analytic dtd in the range of delay times between 3 and 6 gyr , and lacks the dramatic drop at late epochs .",
    "since the clock of the explosion is the evolutionary lifetime of the secondary ( also in the bps simulations ) , it seems that the envelope mass of the secondary has little influence on the efficiency of the production of chandra explosions in the sds channel , in the simulations by @xcite .    to summarise",
    ", the comparison of the analytic curves with other results in the literature shows that the limits on the component s masses play a crucial role in shaping the dtd , while the effects of the limits on @xmath8  are much less evident , except perhaps for the wd+ms progenitors .",
    "while the analytic dtds for the dd models match well the bps results , the dtd of sd models turns out appreciably different .",
    "it seems however that diverse realisations are obtained by different authors , both for the range of @xmath10  of sn ia progenitors , and for the dtd slope .",
    "these differences likely reflect the sensitivity of the results of the systems evolution to details in the prescriptions adopted for the simulations .",
    "by construction , the analytic dtds have a built in parametrisation of some astrophysical variables related to the binary population and to the progenitor s model .",
    "in addition , they are constructed by relating the delay time to the exploding system , so that systematic variations of the properties of sn ia progenitors with the delay time can be envisaged . in this section",
    "these issues are illustrated for the single and the double degenerates .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ dtd_sd ] are constructed upon specification of : the slope of the mass distribution of the primaries ( @xmath33 ) , the distribution of the mass ratios ( @xmath34 ) , the mass range of the primaries and of the secondaries in successful systems .",
    "an additional parameter is the accretion efficiency @xmath35 , namely the fraction of the envelope mass of the secondary which is actually accreted by the primary .",
    "the solid curve in fig .  [ dtd_sd ] assumes @xmath36 ( as all other dtds in this paper ) , a flat distribution of the mass ratios , the maximum possible range for @xmath9  and @xmath10 , and that the whole envelope of the secondary is available for the wd to grow up to the chandrassekhar limit ( @xmath37 ) .",

    "empirical deteminations of the distribution of the mass ratios in binaries are subject to considerable observational biases ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most binary population synthesis computations assume a flat distribution ; on the other hand , there is growing evidence for a prominent population of twins among close binaries , which could enhance the fraction of systems with short delay times ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "[ sd_parama ] shows the distribution of the secondary masses and the ensuing dtds under various assumptions for @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , the two black lines assume a distribution of the mass ratios made of two components : the solid line adopts    @xmath39    which is a flat distribution up to @xmath40 , plus a prominent population of twins .",

    "the dashed black line adopts    @xmath42    which roughly reproduces @xcite s results , with a strong component at the lowest and highest values of the mass ratio , and a minimum at @xmath43 .",
    "clearly , the distributions with a high proportion of twins ( the two dashed lines and the solid black line ) provide dtds which are relatively more populated at the short delay times .",
    "the effect however does not appear dramatic , nor does a two components @xmath34 , as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq_fpi ] ) and ( [ eq_ftri ] ) , reflect into a two components dtd .",
    "all following computations adopt a flat distribution of the mass ratios , an option which maximises the fraction of late epoch explosions .",

    "the possibility of accreting only half of the envelope of the secondary has a dramatic impact on the number of systems with a low mass secondary which manage a chandra explosion ; correspondingly , the dtd drops rapidly off at delay times slightly over a gyr .",
    "this makes it difficult for the sd channel to account for a sustained sn ia rate at long delay times : for example , at an age of 13 gyr , the stars evolving off the ms for a single burst stellar population have a mass of @xmath45 . with a core mass of 0.3 @xmath6 ,",
    "only 0.6 @xmath6  are available for accretion onto the companion wd , and , if @xmath44 , the chandrassekar limit can be met only starting with a co wd heavier than 1.1 @xmath6 .",

    "a strong discontinuity may instead be obtained by implementing a dramatic change in sn ia production at some value of @xmath10 , due to the one to one correspondence between delay time and mass of the secondary in the sd model . in particular , a lower limit on @xmath10  has the effect of vanishing the dtd at delays longer than the ms lifetime of such stellar mass .",
    "the dashed - dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ sd_param ] show the effect of adopting a lower limit of 4.5 @xmath6  to the secondaries in sn ia progenitors , mimicking what happens for the sd helium star channel which requires massive secondaries .",
    "notice that , according to @xcite , the secondary mass in such sn ia progenitors ought to be larger than 5.6 @xmath6 , implying a drop off in the dtd at @xmath5 80 myr .",
    "i turn now to consider some properties of the exploding wd which are predicted to vary systematically with the delay time in the context of the sd model .",
    "@xcite presents a systematic study of the sensitivity of ignition conditions for h - rich chandra sd exploders on various properties of the progenitor .",
    "these authors find that the more massive and/or the cooler the co wd when accretion starts , the higher the central density at ignition .",
    "while it is not clear whether this leads to a larger or lower mass of synthesised @xmath2 , a systematic variation of ignition density could translate into a systematic variation of the properties of the sn ia explosions .",
    "it is thus interesting to analyse how the initial mass of the co wd and its cooling time vary with the delay time .",
    "the top panel in fig .",
    "[ sd_syst ] shows the range for the initial wd mass of sn ia progenitors as function of the delay time , for a few choices of the relevant parameters .",
    "the limits on the wd mass follow from the limits on @xmath9  through the adopted initial - final mass relation ( @xmath48 as in paper i ) .",
    "the maximum value of the primary mass is 8 @xmath6 irrespective of the delay time ; the lower limit is given by @xmath10  ( function of @xmath30 ) , or higher , either because a fixed limit on @xmath9  sets in ( 2 @xmath6  for the solid line , 5 @xmath6  for the dotted line ) , or , at late delay times , because of the need of securing a chandrasekhar mass at explosion .",
    "correspondingly , the range of initial mass for the co wd is small at short delays ( only massive binaries have had time to evolve ) , but it rapidly increases with @xmath30 ; at intermediate delay times the range of initial wd mass is maximum , but at late delays it shrinks , because a massive primary is required to accomplish a chandra explosion .",
    "the latter regime sets in earlier for a less efficient accretion ( e.g. the dashed curve ) .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ sd_syst ] shows the range of cooling times of the co wd , i.e. the time elapsed between its the formation and the start of the accretion phase . in this time interval",
    "the wd cools , becomes progressively more degenerate , and other processes like c and o separation and crystallisation ( e.g. @xcite ) set in .",
    "the path towards explosion , and the explosion outcome critically depend on the initial structure of the co wd , or , in turn , on the cooling time .",
    "for example , the c and o relative diffusion may affect the amount of synthesised @xmath2 , hence the light curve .",
    "on average , the cooling time increases with the delay time , and its range reaches a maximum at @xmath30@xmath32 1 gyr , to become smaller at longer @xmath30 . most noticeably , the cooling time is very long , up to several gyr , for most values of delay time .    to summarise ,",
    "some dispersion in both parameters is present at all delay times , but for early events this dispersion is more pronounced .",
    "qualitatively , then , we may expect more diversity in sn ia events from younger stellar populations . on the other hand , at short delays the co wd at the beginning of the accretion phase is ( on average ) more massive and younger ; thus , due to compensating effects , the trend of ignition density with delay time could be relatively weak .",
    "conversely , at long delay times the mass and cooling age of the co wd both increase with @xmath30 , so that the ignition density should increase systematically .",
    "it is important to notice that very long cooling times , of few to several gyrs , characterise most of the events , whereas @xcite models include cooling ages of @xmath32 1 gyr at most . as the delay time increases",
    ", the co wd has time to become more and more degenerate before the start of the accretion phase .",
    "the evolution of the wd structure during the accretion phase , as well as the outcome of c ignition under extremely degenerate conditions are important questions which need more attention than currently present in the literature .      due to the relatively restricted mass range of the binary components ( i.e. from 2 to 8 @xmath6 ) in the dd model ,",
    "the dtd is not very sensitive to the imf slope and to the distribution of the mass ratios , whereas the main parameters controlling its shape are the maximum delay due to the ms evolution of the secondary ( @xmath49 ) , and the shape of the distribution of the separations .",
    "the parameter @xmath49  is the evolutionary lifetime of the least massive secondary in successful sn ia progenitors : the heavier this limit is , the earlier the position of the cusp in the dtd for both close and wide dds .",
    "the shape of the distribution of the separations of the dd systems controls instead the overall slope of the decline as the delay time grows : if most systems are born close , most events have a short @xmath18  and the dtd declines faster . fig .",
    "[ dd_param ] shows these dependences ; notice that the dtds are not normalised to 1 for illustrative purposes .",
    "the three values of @xmath49  which characterise the curves in the left panels correspond to a minimum mass of the secondary in successful systems of 2 ( solid ) , 2.5 ( dashed ) and 3 @xmath6  ( dot - dashed ) : for normalised dtds , the fraction of early events is higher when this minimum mass is larger .",
    "the curves in the right panels all adopt a minimum @xmath10  of 3 @xmath6 , but different distributions of the separations , as described by the parameters @xmath29  and @xmath28  for the wide and close cases respectively .",
    "although the two parameters are defined in a different way ( see sect .",
    "2.2 ) , the smaller their values the larger the fraction of systems with small separation @xmath19 , and the three curves correspond to a flat distribution ( solid ) , a distribution more populated at small ( dot - dashed ) and at large ( dashed ) separations .",
    "for all the values of the @xmath50 parameters considered here , the dtd declines towards long delay times , but the slope is milder when @xmath29  or @xmath28  are larger , since in this case more systems have a long gravitational wave radiation delay . consequently , the higher @xmath29  or @xmath28 , the larger the fraction of events at late epochs .",
    "some other parameters have been fixed to derive the dtds shown in fig .",
    "[ dd_param ] : the minimum evolutionary lifetime of the secondary ( @xmath51 ) and the minimum @xmath18  ( @xmath52 ) in successful systems .",
    "the adopted values are ( @xmath51,@xmath52 ) = ( 0.04,0.001 ) gyr , and correspond , respectively , to assuming that ( i ) the most massive secondary in sn ia progenitors is an 8 @xmath6  star , and ( ii ) that the minimum delay due to gravitational wave radiation is negligibly small . on the other hand , the upper limit to @xmath10  could be lower than 8 @xmath6 , if , e.g. , systems with massive secondaries feed the sd , rather than the dd channel .",
    "likewise , a significant lower limit to @xmath18  could be realised in nature , if , e.g. , dd systems which are born too close , or are too massive , undergo an accretion induced collapse rather than a sn ia explosion .",
    "both alternatives deprive the dtd of early events , while maintaining the population at long delay times .",
    "[ dd_parama ] shows the effect of varying separately @xmath51  and @xmath52  for the close and the wide dd models : some dtds assume a nominal @xmath52  coupled to @xmath51=0.1 and 0.15 gyr ( corresponding to a minimum @xmath10  of 5.2 and 4.3 @xmath6  respectively ) ; some dtds assume the default @xmath51=0.04 gyr coupled to @xmath52=0.1 and 0.2 gyr .",
    "the latter limits correspond to systems with a separation of 1 @xmath26  and masses @xmath22=2 and 1.4 @xmath6  respectively . in all cases",
    "the dtd is deprived of events with delay times shorter than ( @xmath51 + @xmath52 ) , but the overall shape is not much affected , though for the wide dd case a higher @xmath52  spreads the dtd toward longer delay times .",
    "it is also worth noting that the cusp in all dtds is actually located at @xmath30=@xmath49 + @xmath52 : indeed , when the minimum gravitational wave radiation delay is non negligible , the limit @xmath53 corresponds to a discontinuity in the parameter space for @xmath30  located at @xmath49+@xmath52 .    for the dd channel , at each delay time",
    "the events come from systems with a range of @xmath12  ( e.g. @xmath54 ) and a corresponding range of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , systems with different masses of the components and different separations end up exploding at the same delay time , so that the occurrence of a significant discontinuity in the dtd at a particular delay time is unlikely .",
    "similarly , there is no one to one correspondence between the delay time and the mass of any of the wd components ; however there is a trend of high mass binaries providing preferentially explosions at early delays .",
    "the diversity of the sn ia light curves could be due to the range of total mass @xmath22  if , e.g. , the amount of @xmath2  produced in the event was correlated to the total mass of the exploding system .",
    "for example , the extra mass @xmath55 could act as a _",
    "tamper _ in the explosion , i.e. inertially containing it a little longer , and lead to a higher production of @xmath2 .",
    "although this possibility has not been explored with theoretical models , it is worth noting that the remarkable event snls-03d3bb was both over - luminous and super - chandrassekhar @xcite .",

    "some of these systems merge at a delay time @xmath30 . if the close binary evolution ends up with a wide range of separations of the dd systems irrespective of the components masses",
    ", the maximum @xmath22  is the remnant of the ( 8 + 8 ) @xmath6  systems , i.e. @xmath22= ( 1.2 + 1.2 ) @xmath6 , independent of @xmath30 .",
    "it will be in fact always possible to find a massive system wide enough , so that the gravitational wave radiation delay equals @xmath30-@xmath12 .",
    "this upper limit could be appropriate for the wide dd case ( dashed line ) .",
    "however , massive binaries , which end up with massive remnants , also undergo a severe shrinkage , especially in the close dd case .",
    "therefore , high @xmath22  will be associated to short @xmath18 , and short total delays in general ; this introduces a trend for the upper limit to @xmath22  with @xmath30 . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ dd_syst ] illustrates this effect , and has been computed by applying the @xmath11  recipe to two consecutive rlof episodes .",
    "the exact location of this upper limit depends on various parameters ( e.g. @xmath11 , maximum separation of the interacting systems , initial - final mass relation ) , but the general trend is realistic . in fact , at each delay time , the maximum @xmath22  is realised in systems with maximum remnants from @xmath9  and @xmath10  which merge within @xmath56 . since @xmath18  is shorter in more massive systems , due to its explicit dependence on @xmath22 , as well as to the higher shrinkage , the above condition is met for certain values of @xmath9  and @xmath10  below their maximum values of 8 @xmath6 .",
    "the calculation shows that , as the total delay time grows , the condition above is first met with the maximum @xmath9  ( 8 @xmath6 ) in combination with a progressively less massive secondary , until the latter reaches the lower limit on @xmath10  ( e.g. 2 @xmath6 ) adopted for the dd progenitors . at delay times longer than this the maximum @xmath22  is realised in systems with @xmath10= 2 @xmath6  and a progressively lighter maximum primary .",
    "the transition between the two regimes is marked by the cusp in fig.[dd_syst ] .",
    "to summarise , for the wide dd case we expect a wide range of @xmath22  at any delay time , and virtually no trend for the average mass of the exploding wd with the age of the parent galaxy .",
    "instead in the close dd case we expect a definite trend of decreasing average @xmath22  with increasing delay time , i.e. with increasing average age of the parent population .",
    "in addition , the range of @xmath22  in sn ia progenitors should become narrower in old systems , where the events should basically come from @xmath22  close to the chandrassekhar mass .",
    "as shown in the previous sections , the different channels for sn ia production are in principle capable to provide both _",
    "prompt _ and _ tardy _ events , as required by the data .",
    "moreover , for all channels the dtd favours early events , so that the sn ia rate per unit mass in young stellar systems is expected higher than in old ones , again as required by the observations .",
    "although the fraction of early explosions is different for the different channels , and within the same channel it depends on the astrophysical parameters which characterise the progenitor systems , each model is compatible with the decreasing rate per unit mass going from late to early type galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "there s no real need to view the various models as mutually exclusive , and both sd and dd paths could well be realised in nature . from the stellar evolution point of view , the sd channel has more difficulty to produce chandrassekhar explosions at very late epochs past star formation , because of the small mass reservoir from the donor ; the dd channel instead , can provide events at delay times exceeding the hubble time due to the possibility of realising very long @xmath18 . therefore , rather than considering the two channels as mutually exclusive , it seems wiser to construct a mixed model , in which both sd and dd events concur to the sn ia explosion . among the many possible combinations , i consider two extreme hypothesis : the _ solomonic _ mix , in which both sd and dd channels contribute half of the total events within 13 gyr ; the _ segregated _ mix , in which the sd explosions provide the early events , while the dd channel feeds all the remaining delay times .",
    "although many other combinations are possible , it is instructive to see how these choices , which maximise the contribution of the two channels , impact on the dtd , and explore how the mix may be constrained by the observations .",
    "[ dtd_mix ] shows the solomonic ( left ) and the segregated ( right ) mixtures obtained with the particular choice of parameters for the individual channels as described in the caption .",
    "the solomonic mix is characterised by a dtd which is very similar to each of the sd and dd models used to construct it ; the only significant feature is the intermediate slope of the decline at very late delays , where the number of events is kept relatively high due to the contribution from the dd channel .",
    "this characteristic is relevant for the sn ia rate in the oldest galaxies , as will be illustrated later on . at each delay time , the ratio between dd and sd explosions varies , but it keeps within a factor of 2 over almost the whole range of @xmath30 : only for @xmath57 9 gyr does the dd channel definitely prevail .",
    "this kind of mixture and its evolution over cosmic time has been studied in @xcite . in general , for the solomonic mixture , the majority of sn ia events in early type galaxies should come from dd systems with @xmath22  close to the chandrassekhar mass .",
    "the events in late type galaxies , instead , should come from both channels and may include super - chandra explosions from dd progenitors .",
    "the segregated mix assumes that systems with @xmath58 feed the sd channel , while systems hosting less massive secondaries undergo ce evolution at the second rlof , to become dds , hence the discontinuity at 0.1 gyr .",
    "this combination mimics the dtd proposed by @xcite to explain the high sn ia rate in radio loud ellipticals as due to a recent sf episode in combination with a high fraction of _ prompt _ explosions . actually ,",
    "if this were the case , the excess of 7 ia events in the radio loud ellipticals would imply that @xmath5 14 cc sne should have been detected in the same sample , while none was observed @xcite .",
    "it is anyway instructive to consider this dtd as an example of a distribution with a high fraction of events at very short delay times ; here a fraction of 30 % _",
    "prompt _ events was chosen following the indications from chemical evolution models by @xcite . in this option ,",
    "all events in early type galaxies come from the dd channel , while in galaxies with ongoing star formation we get a mixture of sd and dd explosions . in most cases , the two channels will be providing events with similar probability : in fact the sn ia rate in a galaxy @xmath5 13 gyr after the beginning of star formation is given by :",
    "@xmath59    where @xmath60  is the number of sn ia from a stellar population of unitary mass ( or sn ia productivity ) , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the ( @xmath63  weighted ) average sf rates over , respectively , the last 0.1 gyr and from 0.1 up to 13 gyr ago . equation ( [ eq_rate ] ) explicitly shows the two contributions of _ prompt _ and _ tardy _ components of the dtd : if their ratio is of 0.3 to 0.7 , in order to have an equal probability to realise sd or dd explosions it suffice that the current sf rate exceeds the average sf rate in the past by a factor of @xmath5 2 .    to summarise , both the solomonic and the segregated mixtures provide sd and dd explosions in virtually all galaxy types , but in the very old galaxies , where ( almost ) all events should come from the dd channel .",
    "it is worth noting that this conclusion only applies to chandra explosions , since sub - chandra events could be common at very late delay times both in the single and double degenerate scenarios .",
    "the scaling of the sn ia rate in different stellar systems offers the opportunity of constraining the dtd , hence the sn ia progenitor model ( e.g. paper i,@xcite ) . to this end",
    "i consider two sets of data : ( i ) the relation between the sn ia rate per unit luminosity and the morphological type of the parent galaxy ( @xcite , hereinafter gc09 ) and ( ii ) the relation between the sn ia rate per unit mass and the specific sf rate ( ssfr ) of the parent galaxy @xcite . both relations ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) basically stem from dtd being more populated at early delay times : as a consequence , the rate per unit mass is higher the younger the stellar system . a later galaxy type and/or a higher specific sf rate correspond to a larger fraction of young stars , hence a higher sn ia rate per unit mass , or per unit luminosity , as far as luminosity traces the stellar mass .",
    "nonetheless the two observational relations are largely independent ( i ) because of the different galaxy sample , and ( ii ) because of the different normalisation of the sn ia rate , and different galaxy age tracer .",
    "therefore , they yield complementary information on the dtd . in the next sections ,",
    "the quantitative fit of the two relations is attempted separately .",
    "the indication that late type galaxies are more efficient in producing sn ia events goes back to @xcite , and was interpreted as due to a dtd more populated at short delay times already by @xcite and @xcite . since then",
    ", this observational feature has been put on firm grounds as a correlation between the sn ia rate per unit b - band luminosity ( rate in snu s @xmath64 , @xmath65  and @xmath6  respectively . ] ) with the @xmath66 colour of the parent galaxy @xcite , and a correlation between the rate per unit k band luminosity ( rate in snuk s ) and the @xmath67 colour of the parent galaxy @xcite .",
    "both correlations are based on the @xcite sample of ( nearby ) galaxies .",
    "@xcite also derived the rate per unit mass ( rate in snum s ) as a function of the parent galaxy @xmath67 colour , later used in paper i and in @xcite to derive clues on the characteristics of the dtd . in particular",
    ", paper i found that both close and wide dd models could explain the data , provided that the dtd slope was neither very flat nor very steep .",
    "however , the rate in snum s relies on theoretical models which are needed to convert the galaxies k - band luminosities into their mass ; therefore the purely _ observed _ relations involve the rates per unit luminosities .",
    "the attempt to account for both @xcite and @xcite trends of the rates in snu s and snuk s with the parent galaxy @xmath66 and @xmath67 colors fails ( gc09 ) , with the rate per unit @xmath68  requiring a flatter dtd than the rate per unit @xmath69 .",
    "this is because the slope of the observed correlations depend on both the dtd and on the sf history assumed to model the galaxies . to improve on the description of the latter",
    ", gc09 constrained the sample galaxies to be represented by the family of sf history laws adopted by @xcite :    @xmath70    which peaks at progressively older ages as the parameter @xmath71  decreases .",
    "a short @xmath71  also implies a narrow age distribution , akin to early type galaxies , while for @xmath72 gyr the sf rate monotonically increases up to the present , having adopted an age of 13 gyr for all galaxies .",
    "a calibration of @xmath71  versus the morphological galaxy type @xmath73 ( as given in the rc3 catalogue , @xcite ) was obtained by fitting the @xmath66 and @xmath67 colours of the sample galaxies . in this way",

    "this explains the large variation of the model rate in snuk s compared to that in snu s ; it also explains why the rate in snu s can even be predicted higher in early than in late type galaxies ( see e.g. model ddw2 ) .",
    "the models are normalised to the observed value at @xmath80 , intermediate between sa and sb galaxies ; the normalisation yields a value for @xmath60 , i.e. the productivity of sn ia from one unit mass stellar population , which depends on the assumed imf .",

    "a detailed discussion of the uncertainty on @xmath60  requires a thorough evaluation of the quality of the fits , which goes beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "this problem is lessened for the solomonic mixture , due to the dramatic drop of the sd channel at long delay times . however , when considering the merged e+s0 class , the dd close model with a flat distribution of @xmath19  becomes compatible with the data .",
    "it is then very important to derive a robust measurement of the sn ia rate separately for the two morphological types : in early type galaxies , a difference in average age of @xmath52 gyr has a strong effect on the sn ia rate per unit mass , if a sizable contribution from the sd channel exists .",
    "the fact that the rate in snu s in s0 galaxies appears so much higher than in es favours this interpretation , although the statistics is still too poor to draw such conclusion . in this respect , the sd model appears to best represent the data .",

    "these values hold for a bottom light imf , such as kroupa s , and for galaxy ages older than @xmath5 1 gyr .",

    "a refined fit of the sn ia productivity seems unworthy , since the models and the data are not completely compatible as just discussed , and since the sf history of the galaxies is not well constrained .    the slope of the theoretical correlation between the rate per unit mass and the ssfr appears virtually insensitive to the assumed sf history , for star forming galaxies , as already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the models overlap each other along a locus which is well described by a power law along which the younger the galaxy ( either because of its current or its average age ) , the higher its ssfr , _ and _ its sn ia rate per unit mass .",
    "the exponent of the power law is sensitive to the model dtd ; for the models plotted in fig.[pritchet ] it ranges from 0.6 ( sd model ) to 0.8 ( segregated mixture with ddc1 model ) .",
    "in addition , the theoretical relation is found systematically steeper for the segregated mixtures compared to solomonic mixtures or single channel models .    in general , all dtds yield and acceptable representation of the data .",
    "taken at face value , the observed correlation seems to favour models with a moderate power at the early delay times , as the sd model , or the solomonic mixtures .",
    "the segregated mixtures tend to predict a too high sn ia rate in star bursting galaxies at given ssfr value , but no strong conclusion can be drawn from this comparison .",
    "@xcite also determine the sn ia rate per unit mass in _ passive _ galaxies ( from snls data ) , which turns out very close to the rate measured for galaxies in the bin at ssfr=@xmath96 @xmath6/yr .",
    "this point is not plotted on fig.[pritchet ] , where , instead , i show the location of two models for old stellar populations ( see caption ) , in which most of the stellar mass has been made at high redshift .",
    "these models have virtually null current specific sf rate and yet their current sn ia rate is relatively high due to the late delay times component of the dtd .",
    "this interpretation differs from what concluded in @xcite mainly because of the different rendition of the sf history in passive galaxies . adopting eq .",
    "[ eq_psi ] with a short @xmath71 , the ssfr quickly drops as the time from the beginning of star formation increases , so that negligible ssfr are obtained when the snia rate is still relatively high because of the _ tardy _ component .",
    "for example , a model with @xmath97 gyr , at an age of 10 gyr has a ssfr of @xmath98 @xmath6/yr and an average age of 7.5 gyr . with this star formation history ,",
    "the sd dtd plotted in fig .",
    "[ pritchet ] predicts a snia rate of @xmath99 ( @xmath6yr)@xmath100 , matching the rate in passive galaxies determined by @xcite .",
    "however , as noticed in the previous section , such sd model assumes a 100 % accretion of the envelope of the secondary onto the co wd , and a flat distribution of @xmath101 , so that the rate at late epochs is enhanced . for this reason ,",
    "dd models , and/or solomonic mixtures could be more plausible .",
    "this paper presents the theoretical expectations for sn ia progenitors focusing on two questions : the shape of the distribution of the delay times and the possible diversity of sn ia progenitors of events at different delay times .",
    "these two issues impact on the cosmological use of sn ia s as distance indicators because they may entail a systematic diversity between events at low and high redshift , where the progenitors are younger and more massive . as in paper",
    "i , the approach refrains from describing the evolution of individual systems , rather concentrating on the clock of the explosion and on a few parameters singled out as crucial for the two issues .",
    "in particular , different from bps renditions , the mass exchange phases during the binary evolution are not followed , and their result in promoting or not the final event is considered as an equally plausible option .",
    "the dependence of the likelihood of the sn ia event on the initial binary separation is also neglected , having assumed that ( i ) there is a range of separations suitable for the realisation of the sn ia , and that ( ii ) this range does not depend on the other binary parameters ( @xmath9  and @xmath10 ) . while strictly speaking the latter assumption is untrue ( see discussion at the beginning of section 2.3 ) , the comparison of the analytic dtds with the results of bps simulations seem to indicate that the crucial parameters are indeed the masses of the components .",
    "i have illustrated the main features of the analytic dtd for the single and the double degenerate evolutionary channels , concentrating on chandrassekhar exploders , since sub - chandra models are currently disfavoured .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth pointing out that sub - chandra events could be important especially to account for sn ia s in old stellar populations .",
    "actually these events are an embarrassment , since they are much easier realised than chandra explosions , yet there are no established observational counterparts .",
    "crucial parameters for shaping the sd dtd are the limits on the primary and on the secondary mass , and the efficiency of accretion onto the co wd .",
    "the dtd is populated only within delay times comprised between the ms lifetime of the most and least massive secondary in the progenitor s system ; a lower accretion efficiency results into a steepening of the dtd at late epochs .",
    "if only half of the envelope of the secondary is used for the mass growth of the co wd , the dtd drops by three order of magnitudes between 1 and 10 gyr , making the rate in old stellar systems negligibly small . for both flavours of dd models ( close and wide ) ,",
    "the major parameters are the minimum mass of the secondary in successful systems and the slope of the distribution of the separations of the dd systems at birth .",
    "additional parameters are the minimum values for the delays @xmath12  and @xmath18 , the former being directly connected to the maximum value of @xmath10  in successful systems .",
    "the comparison of the analytic dtds with results in the literature shows a very good agreement with bps renditions for the dd close channel ( renditions for the dd wide channel are lacking in the literature ) .",
    "less favourable is the comparison for the sd channel , for which the bps results yield a large variety of dtd shapes .",
    "clearly , in the simulations , the efficiency with which this channel produces sn ia events is very sensitive to the criteria adopted to describe the mass exchange phases and the fate of the accreting wds .      in principle , all channels accommodate _ prompt _ and _ tardy _ events , but the dtd is very continuous so that this distinction appears artificial . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cumul ] , for the single channel dtds , the cumulative fraction of explosions smoothly increases with the delay time , so that the fraction of _ prompt _ events depends on the definition of the timescale over which the events are considered as such . as shown in figs [ morph ] and [ pritchet ] these dtds , with no strong discontinuity , do account well for the observed trends of the sn ia rates with the parent stellar population .",
    "motivated by recent observations which suggest that both sd and dd explosions may be realised in nature , i have constructed mixed models under two extreme assumptions : the _ solomonic _ option , in which the two channels contribute the same fraction of events within a hubble time , and the _ segregated _ mix , in which the sd and dd channels feed distinct ranges of delay times . since the sd model has difficulties to account for late epoch explosions , i assumed that it provides a very _ prompt _ component of the dtd .",
    "this composition allows one to introduce a sharp discontinuity when the channel producing the events changes ; the position in delay time of this discontinuity has been ( arbitrarily ) fixed at 0.1 gyr to mimic the dtd proposed by @xcite . in the attempt of constraining the dtds , either single channel or mixed models ,",
    "i have considered the observed correlations between ( i ) the sn ia rate per unit luminosity and the parent galaxy type ( gc09 ) , and ( ii ) the sn ia rate per unit mass and the specific sf rate of the parent galaxy @xcite .",
    "theoretical expectations have been computed with a population synthesis technique , adopting a variety of sf histories for the galaxies . to construct the first of the two correlations , the galaxies @xmath102 and @xmath103 colours",
    "have been used to constrain the sf history ; correlation ( ii ) turns out largely independent of the adopted shape for the sf , as found by @xcite . the observed correlation between the sn ia rate per unit luminosity and the parent galaxy morphological type appears to require a substantial depletion of the dtd at late delay times .",
    "this holds especially for the rate measured in snu s and derives from the drop of the rate going from s0 to e galaxies , which is not detectable when the two classes are merged together .",
    "in fact , the colours of s0s and es indicate that the former are slightly younger , although both galaxy types are dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "s0s and es , then , probe the dtd at very late delay times , where , e.g. , the sd model predicts a considerable drop .",
    "the steepening of the rate going from s0 to es measured in gc09 supports dtds with a steep decline at late delays , as the sd channel , or solomonic mixtures .",
    "the dd channel and the segregated mix could also meet this constraint , provided that the distribution of the separations is skewed at the short end .",
    "this interpretation needs to be confirmed with larger galaxy samples and more sn ia events .",
    "the correlation between the sn ia rate and the galaxy type does not provide a robust constraint on the shape of the dtd at short delay times , because the sf history in the latest galaxies is not known with sufficient accuracy , and , admittedly , the colours of irregulars are not well reproduced by the populations synthesis presented here .",
    "the theoretical rates are found consistent with the data for irregulars and sc galaxies even with the relatively low fraction of _ prompt _ events of the sd model , but a better understanding of the recent and past sf history in these galaxies is needed to derive robust conclusions .",
    "the correlation between the sn ia rate per unit mass and the ssfr is compatible with the models for most of the explored dtds , although the rates in the star bursting galaxies indicate that the dtd should not be too skewed at the short delay times , thus disfavouring very steep dd close models and segregated mixtures .",
    "models computed with the sd dtd yield a very nice description of the correlation for the star forming galaxies ; the rate in passive galaxies may also be well reproduced with this dtd if their inhabiting stellar populations have a ( small ) age spread : e.g. , one model galaxy having formed @xmath5 80% of its current mass within the first 1.7 gyr , at an age of 9 gyr has a sn ia rate and 37 % a mass return .",
    "] of @xmath104 ( @xmath6yr)@xmath95 very close to what determined for the passive galaxies in @xcite ( @xmath105 ( @xmath6yr)@xmath95 ) .",
    "however , this estimate assumes that all of the envelope of the secondary is accreted by the co wd companion , which looks contrived .",
    "the fit of the observed relations yields a value for the productivity @xmath60 , i.e. the number of sn ia s produced by a unit mass stellar population over the whole range of delay times .",
    "in general @xmath60  depends on the imf , dtd and sf history assumed to model the galaxies , but the dependence on the dtd is small for systems in which the sf rate varies little over the whole range of ages , and actually vanishes for a constant sf rate ( see paper i ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper , the value of @xmath60  is derived by matching the level of the sn ia rate in galaxies of intermediate type ( sa - sb ) .",
    "assuming a bottom light imf ( salpeter flattened below 0.5 @xmath6 ) , from the rates in snu s ( snuk s ) in gc09 i find @xmath106 , with a 50 % total variation for all the dtds plotted in fig .",
    "[ morph ] ( single and mixed channels ) .",
    "this value requires that @xmath32 8 % of all stars with mass between 2.5 and 8 @xmath6  produce a sn ia event . for the segregated mixture",
    ", 30 % of the progenitors are assumed to come from systems with @xmath10  between 5 and 8 @xmath6 : this corresponds to a likelihood of the sn ia event of @xmath107 from the more massive progenitors , and of @xmath108 for stars with mass between 5 and 2.5 @xmath6 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the sn ia to the core collapse ( cc ) sne productivity ( @xmath109 ) for the same imf .",
    "the number of cc events per unit mass from a stellar generation depends on mass limits of the progenitors ; assuming an upper limit of 40 @xmath6 , it amounts to 6.5 ( 9 ) events every 1000 @xmath6  for a lower limit of 10 ( 8) @xmath6 , having adopted a salpeter flattened imf .",
    "thus , each stellar generation is expected to produce @xmath5 2 - 3 cc sne per sn ia ; the events , though , occur at different delay times : all the cc explosions take place soon after the star formation episode , while the sn ia events are diluted over the whole hubble time , with only the _ prompt _ component exploding early . for the segregated mixture considered here , a 1000 @xmath6  stellar populations provides @xmath110 ( _ prompt _ )",
    "sn ia within 0.1 gyr from birth ; the same stellar population provides @xmath5 7 cc sne within 30 myr from birth .",
    "therefore , a sample of elliptical galaxies supposed to have experienced a starburst within the last 0.1 gyr should yield 7 cc to 1 ia _ prompt _ events ; thus the excess of 7 sn ia s in radio loud ellipticals noticed by @xcite should be accompanied by @xmath111 cc events in the same galaxy sample , while none was observed . this observational result would require a detection efficiency of cc events @xmath111 times lower than that of ia events , which is very hard to understand .",
    "the problem of the _ missing _ cc sne in radio loud ellipticals becomes worse if the cc productivity is higher , as implied , e.g. , by a lower limit of 8 @xmath6  for their progenitors .",
    "it is worth noticing that although dust obscuration may preferentially hide cc sne , since they explode soon after the onset of sf , in late type spirals 2.5 cc events are detected every 1 snia @xcite , which shows that dust does not have that dramatic effect at least in this kind of galaxies .",
    "the productivity @xmath60  can also be determined by fitting the rates from @xcite . matching the sn ia rate in galaxies with ssfr = @xmath94 ( @xmath6yr)@xmath95 requires @xmath112 , which is @xmath113 times lower than what estimated from the rates per unit luminosity .",
    "notice that with this lower productivity , the problem of the _ missing _ cc events in radio loud ellipticals worsens .",
    "the discrepancy between the productivities estimated from the two kinds of correlations may be due to the different astrophysical ingredients for the stellar population models adopted here and in @xcite : the imf , the sf history ( i.e. age and metallicity distribution ) of the galaxies , the stellar tracks to describe their light .",
    "in fact , in order to obtain the observational sn ia rates and ssfr , assumptions are necessary for all of these ingredients .",
    "in addition , the estimates for @xmath60  derived here represent zero point determinations , rather than accurate fits to the data , and the true distance between the best fitting @xmath60  values from the two correlations could be smaller than what quoted above .",
    "all in all , the results on the productivity of sn ia s from matching the observed rates are rather encouraging , though there seems to be a systematic difference between the values derived from the two data sets , with the rate per unit luminosity requiring a factor of @xmath5 2 higher productivity . whether this is a robust conclusion or not can be established only with complete consistency of assumptions in modelling and observational estimates .",
    "the astrophysical parameter responsible for the diversity of @xmath2  production , and then of sn ia light curves , has not been identified yet .",
    "a number of possibilities have been proposed in the literature , some of which related to the progenitor , like metallicity , age , ignition density , others more related to the physical phenomena taking place during the explosion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . from an empirical point of view",
    ", the most conspicuous evidence concerns the correlation between the sn ia light curve properties and the ( average ) age of the parent stellar population @xcite , metallicity playing , in case , a secondary role .",
    "this suggests the possibility that the diversity of sn ia s is strongly related to their delay time .    according to stellar evolution one expects a trend for the average mass and temperature of the wd progenitor with delay time , but with a substantial spread . for the sd model ,",
    "the average mass of the co wd at the start of accretion first decreases , reaches a minimum , but then increases again , since at the late delay times only massive co wds are able to grow up to the chandrassekhar limit .",
    "the range encompassed by the mass of the co wd is maximum at @xmath114 1 gyr , but becomes narrower at late delays . for the dd wide channel , the total mass of the successful dd system",
    "is expected to vary between 1.4 and 2.4 @xmath6  ( almost ) irrespective of the delay time , since for each combination of @xmath9  and @xmath10 , small and wide separations should be realised , thereby providing events with any gravitational wave radiation delay . for the dd close channel , instead",
    ", we expect a trend of decreasing average @xmath22  as @xmath30  increases , because the more massive the progenitors , the smaller the separation of the dd system , and then the shorter the time needed to merge .",
    "the time between the formation of the co wd and its final explosion is an increasing function of the delay time .",
    "thus , for the dd close channel , the progenitors of events at short delay times are massive and hot ( when accretion starts ) , while at long delay times they are of low mass and cool . according to @xcite models",
    "these two parameters could induce compensating trends on the ignition density , and the @xmath2  mass synthesised in the explosion may not show big variations over the total range of delay times .",
    "it is worth pointing out , however , that the models explore a range of relatively short cooling times ( up to 1 gyr ) , while the wd progenitors of sn ia s in early type galaxies have been cooling for many gys .",
    "the outcome of the explosion of co wds which start accreting when their structure is so highly degenerate needs to be investigated .",
    "regardless the key astrophysical variable which causes the diversity of sn ia light curves ( whether ignition conditions , metallicity , evolutionary channel leading to the explosion ) , if this variable scales systematically with the delay time one expects a trend of the typical properties of sn ia light curve with the age distribution in the parent stellar population .",
    "the observed correlation will depend on the sf history of the galaxies and on the dtd : the younger the stellar populations and/or the higher the fraction of short delay times , the higher the likelihood that a detected sn ia event has a short @xmath30 .",
    "as an illustrative example , fig.[taudist ] shows the distribution of the delay times of events occurring in galaxies with 13 gyr of age , having experienced different sf histories .",
    "the differential distributions are computed as :    @xmath115    and represent the probability that a sn ia detected in a galaxy of a certain type has a given delay time .",
    "it appears that in the late galaxy types most of the events cover a range of delay times up to about 1 - 2 gyr : as shown in sect .",
    "3 this is wide enough to encompass the whole range of masses of the co wds . only in the case of strongly star bursting galaxies",
    "the majority of events may come from a truly _ prompt _ component , i.e. the most massive and hottest co wds .",
    "even for the segregated mixture in combination with the model for irregular galaxies , more than 40 % of the sn ia s should have a delay time in excess of 0.5 gyr . in sa galaxies",
    "all the delay times have about the same probability of being sampled , and the distribution remains wide also in s0 galaxies , though mostly confined at @xmath116 gyr ; in ellipticals , instead , we expect to sample only the latest delay times",
    ". therefore , if diversity were related to the delay time , sn ia s in es should be rather uniform , while in later galaxy types we should detect a large variety of light curve properties , as suggested by the data .",
    "notice that in the dd wide channel the mass range of the successful dd systems is not likely to become narrower at late delays : for this model , if diversity was connected to @xmath22 , a wide range of light curve properties should be observed also in the earliest galaxy types .",
    "uniformity of events in old galaxies is supported in @xcite , but it is difficult to understand quantitatively the result that galaxies with a light averaged age in excess of 3 gyr host only faint supernovae ( technically with a low ejected @xmath2  mass ) .",
    "the curves plotted in the bottom left panel of fig.[taudist ] are labelled with the b - light averaged age of each galaxy model . only irregulars and sc galaxies appear younger than 3 gyr , while sb s and sa s have an average age of several gyrs . in these galaxies",
    "the distribution of the delay times of their hosted sn ia s is predicted rather broad , which would imply a broad range of photometric properties , irrespective of the specific dtd model .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to reconcile the notion that delay time is primarily responsible for diversity of sn ia events with @xcite result .",
    "according to expectations of stellar evolution in close binaries the dtd is a continuous distribution , skewed at the short delay times , but with no real justification for a separate _ prompt _ component .",
    "mixed models may implement this concept , e.g. considering that the two channels ( sd and dd ) feed distinct ranges of delay times .",
    "however , there s no clear theoretical reason why it should be so , and the observed correlations between the specific rates and the parent galaxy properties do not appear to require it .",
    "indeed , the observed correlations do not favour mixed over single channel models .",
    "the indication of the two channels being active comes from the data of individual explosions .",
    "more data are needed to establish whether the sd explosions are favoured at short delay times , i.e. in young stellar populations , which could support the segregated mixture models presented here .",
    "the correlation between the sn ia rate per unit b - luminosity and the parent galaxy type suggests a steep drop of the dtd at late epochs , consistent with the sd or dd models with a distribution of separations depleted of wide systems .",
    "the correlation between the sn ia rate per unit mass and the specific sf rate is ( broadly ) consistent with this kind of models , and seems to require a relatively small fraction of _ prompt _ events .",
    "however , in order to constrain the fraction of short delay times in the dtd we need a more accurate description of the sf history in galaxies with high ssfr and of the latest morphological types .",
    "the observed rates allow us to evaluate the sn ia productivity @xmath60 , which appears to be in the range @xmath117 .",
    "although it is reassuring that the different data sets yield values which agree within a factor of @xmath113 , there may be a systematic difference between the productivity evaluated from the rates per unit luminosity and per unit ssfr . on the other hand , the ingredients adopted for the galaxies modelling to fit the two correlations are not exactly the same .",
    "therefore the discrepancy on the sn ia productivity may just reflect a theoretical uncertainty .",
    "concerning the diversity of sn ia light curves , we expect a wide range for the mass of the co wds at the start of the accretion phase in most galaxy types ; only in the older stellar populations the properties of the progenitors should be more uniform . for mixed models , in both the solomonic and segregated flavours , late type galaxies should host sd and dd events with comparable probability , while in early type galaxies most , if not all , sn ia should come from dd progenitors . only in very young stellar populations , with very high specific sf , the sd events are likely to prevail .",
    "current data on the correlation between the light curve properties and the host galaxy seem to yield contradictory indications , possibly because of the use of different parameters to characterise the sn ia light curve and the properties of the host galaxy .",
    "progress requires big samples of events , as well as more accurate knowledge of the age distribution in sn ia hosts ; on the theoretical side more models are also needed , in particular exploring the fate of an accreting co wd which has been cooling for several gyrs , hence starting from highly degenerate conditions .",
    "a broader diversity of progenitor s properties is expected in local sn ia samples compared to high redshift ones , since the former encompass all possible delay times , while the latter necessarily lack events with delay times longer than the corresponding age of the universe .",
    "nevertheless , a fair fraction of explosions in nearby star forming galaxies ( spirals and irregulars ) should have a short delay time , e.g. shorter than 1 gyr .",
    "therefore the empirical _ standardisation _ of the light curve obtained from the sn ia s in nearby star forming galaxies should be applicable also to high redshift events , thus supporting sn ia s as viable standard candles all the way to cosmological distances .",
    "i am indebted to alvio renzini for helpful discussions and comments , and for careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "i also thank enrico cappellaro for discussions and for checking on the discrepancy between the sn ia rate in early type galaxies determined by @xcite and by gc09 .",
    "finally , i thank the anonymous referee for productive comments .",
