    "can be explained away by means of renormalization , singularities in the infrared ( ir ) are more subtle to handle .",
    "qcd is a renormalizable theory and possesses asymptotic freedom .",
    "however , the strong running coupling develops at @xmath1 an artificial singularity , termed ( in one - loop ) the landau pole , that prevents the application of perturbative qcd in the low - momentum spacelike region .",
    "moreover , hadronic quantities calculated at the partonic level are expressed in terms of a power - series expansion in the running coupling and are strongly affected by this ir divergence  in particular in that momentum region accessible to experiment .",
    "truncating this expansion , the result depends on the particular choice of the renormalization scheme and scale , though , on account of the renormalizability of qcd , all - order expressions in different schemes would be the same .",
    "truncated series are numerically _ not _ equal and hence one has to design a scheme and specify a renormalization scale , which minimize the contribution of the discarded terms . in addition , employing a convolution approach to isolate the short - distance part of the process in question , causes beyond leading order ( lo ) of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) a dependence of the result on the factorization scale . much has been written about these problems , but until recently no satisfactory answers were provided .",

    "such terms contribute to the spectral density and their analytic images are inevitably required .",
