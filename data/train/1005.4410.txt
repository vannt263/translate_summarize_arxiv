    "the axion n - flation model is based on a set of @xmath5 uncoupled fields , labelled @xmath6 , each with a potential @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the @xmath10 axion decay constant . in a more general model couplings",

    "if only a single field is present this model is known as natural inflation @xcite .",
    "calculation of the observables @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 makes use of the @xmath14 formula @xcite , which considers how the total number of @xmath15-folds of expansion @xmath16 is modified by field perturbations .",
    "we define slow - roll parameters for each field as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the reduced planck mass , a prime denotes the derivative of a function with respect to its argument , and no summation over @xmath19 is implied .",
    "the global slow - roll parameter @xmath20 can be written as a weighted sum @xmath21 , in which each field contributes according to its share of the total energy density .",
    "we must have @xmath22 during inflation .",
    "we work in the horizon - crossing approximation , in which the dominant contribution to each observable is assumed to arise from fluctuations present only a few @xmath15-folds after horizon exit of the wavenumber under discussion . after smoothing the universe on a superhorizon scale somewhat smaller than any scale of interest ,",
    "the horizon - crossing approximation becomes valid whenever the ensemble of trajectories followed by smoothed patches of the universe approaches an attractor .",
    "we suppose that inflation exits gracefully , with each field settling into the minimum of its potential .",
    "the horizon - crossing formulas will then be a reasonable approximation . using this method , and conventional definitions for each observable parameter @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the first and second derivatives of @xmath16 with respect to the fields , and @xmath26 indicates evaluation at horizon crossing ( determined by eq .",

    "our sign convention for @xmath0 matches wmap @xcite , and the non - gaussianity is predicted to be of local type .",
    "the observed amplitude of perturbations is obtained by adjusting the @xmath28 to give an appropriate value of @xmath29 .    under a quadratic approximation to each potential",

    "the spectral index can be shown to be less than its single field value @xmath31 @xcite with equality only in the equal - mass case .",
    "its value for a given choice of parameters must be computed numerically @xcite .",
    "however , we will see that these results all change whenever our initial conditions populate the hilltop region .",
    "apply for any choice of @xmath28 and @xmath9 .",
    "we restrict attention to the case where all fields have the same potential , which already captures the interesting phenomenology .",
    "a broader investigation will be published elsewhere .",
    "the scale @xmath32 is fixed from the observed amplitude of @xmath33 , leaving @xmath34 and @xmath35 as adjustable parameters .",
    "the initial conditions are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution of angles @xmath12 , with several realizations to explore the probabilistic spread . from these two parameters",
    "we predict the observables @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath36 .",
    "there are two constraints .",
    "first , we require sufficient @xmath15-foldings . for",
    "a given set of initial angles @xmath12 , and ignoring a small correction from the location of the end of inflation , one finds @xmath37 where in the second equality we have replaced @xmath38 with its expectation value by averaging over @xmath12 .",
    "eq .   is replicated to high accuracy in numerical simulations . for a given @xmath39",
    "it determines the minimum number of fields required for sufficient inflation , typically several hundred or more .",
    "there is no similar constraint from the spectral index .",
    "when @xmath40 , the @xmath41 are uniformly distributed and @xmath42 , independent of @xmath39 and @xmath43 .",
    "this tilt is observationally acceptable . for larger @xmath5 the spectral index",
    "approximately satisfies eq .",
    "second , a key motivation of the n - flation model was to obviate the requirement for superplanckian field values , which are invoked in many single - field models .",
    "if one literally imposes @xmath44 this requires @xmath45 for each @xmath19 .",
    "however , it would be reasonable to regard this condition as approximate and not mandatory .",

    "the observable parameters have different scalings with @xmath47 .",
    "the spectrum , @xmath33 , scales like @xmath47 copies of a single - field model with slow - roll parameter @xmath48 , whereas @xmath1 is reduced by a factor @xmath47 compared to its value in the same single - field model . the spectral index can be written exactly ( within slow - roll ) in terms of a single sum coming from @xmath29 , @xmath49 and is independent of @xmath47 .",
    "it becomes close to @xmath50 when the denominator is of order @xmath51 .",
    "this is the standard assisted - inflation mechanism .",
    "most importantly , @xmath0 has the approximate behaviour @xmath52 which is independent of @xmath48 if the dominant fields are sufficiently close to the hilltop .",
    "n - flation has lifted the single - field consistency condition @xmath53 @xcite , which prevents single - field models generating large non - gaussianity without violating observational bounds on @xmath3 .",
    "where the summations in eqs .",
    " are dominated by a single field , this formula shows that @xmath0 can become rather large , scaling as @xmath54 . for @xmath55 ,",
    "we find @xmath56 ; a non - gaussian fraction of this magnitude should be visible to the planck satellite .",
    "it is even possible to achieve @xmath57 for @xmath58 , though then @xmath35 must be very large to gain sufficient @xmath15-foldings . if @xmath59 it may be more profitable for planck to search for non - linearity in the trispectrum @xcite , for which estimates in the quadratic approximation were given in ref .",
    "we defer a full analysis of the trispectrum to future work but note that the trispectrum equivalents of eq .",

    "[ f : fnl ] we plot @xmath0 as a function of @xmath5 for @xmath55 , with ten realizations at each @xmath35 .",

    "the error bars are on the mean over realizations ( not the standard deviation ) . here",
    "the maximum achievable value of @xmath71 is @xmath72 , almost saturated in some realizations .",
    "the significant spread is due to initial condition randomness with typical mean values being around half the maximum achievable value , and no discernable trend with @xmath73 .",

    "the cooperative effect of the n - flation mechanism does not enhance the non - gaussian signal .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 is suppressed by the central limit theorem where @xmath74 fluctuations contribute equally to the curvature perturbation . nor does the large effect arise from a singularity in the @xmath15-folding history , @xmath16 , as a function of its initial angles @xmath12 .",
    "although eq .   is singular in the limit @xmath75 , its taylor expansion is trustworthy unless @xmath76 .",
    "the observed magnitude of @xmath33 requires @xmath77 for each field , so a breakdown of the taylor expansion can not become relevant unless at least one @xmath9 is a few orders of magnitude less than the planck scale , of order @xmath78 .",
    "these constraints additionally imply that we do not trespass on any region of field space where quantum diffusion competes with classical motion .",
    "instead , the large @xmath0 derives from a generic dispersive effect present in any hilltop potential .",
    "measuring the displacement of @xmath6 from the hilltop by @xmath79 , each potential can be approximated in its vicinity by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 satisfies @xmath82 these potentials are tachyonic .",
    "fields close to the hilltop remain almost stationary , while fields further away are ejected downhill .",
    "this process typically leaves a few fields on top of the hill , which have small @xmath46 and dominate the sums in eqs .  .",
    "it seems clear this behaviour is generic for any n - flation model constructed using hilltop potentials .",
    "the few fields remaining in the vicinity of the hilltop each generate contributions to the curvature perturbation with third moment @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "accounting for suppression arising from the central limit theorem , we recover the approximate expression  . for a general hilltop potential ,",
    "well - rehearsed arguments lead us to expect @xmath84 and therefore @xmath85 . in a single - field model",
    "this is the ` @xmath2 problem ' . in an n - flation model",
    ", it is a generic expectation of enhanced non - gaussianity .",
    "even larger yields are possible in some models , including our case , if it is possible to achieve @xmath86 while preserving technical naturalness .    , for a range of choices of @xmath43 .",
    "each point shown is the average of five or more realizations for an @xmath39@xmath43 pair .",
    "we see a strong trend with @xmath39 , well represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnlapprox ] ) with @xmath87 .",
    "the different @xmath43 are scattered by randomness in the initial conditions rather than an identifiable trend.[f : fnl2],title=\"fig:\",width=6 ] +",
    "we have described a new mechanism for generating observably - large cosmic non - gaussianity , based on the strongly - dispersive dynamics of fields in a hilltop region . in a multi - field context such as the axion n - flation model , assisted inflation",
    "can yield a viable spectral index without a major dilution of the non - gaussianity .",
    "as compared to the quadratic potential approximation to n - flation , we found a substantial decrease in @xmath1 , a modest increase in @xmath4 , and a substantial increase in @xmath0 .",
    "these changes will happen whenever initial conditions have a significant probability of populating the hilltop region , such as the uniform ( in field angle ) initial conditions we chose .",
    "searches have previously been made for models which achieve @xmath88 while preserving slow - roll during inflation @xcite .",
    "the n - flation model is of this type , but offers several advantages .",
    "the non - gaussian fraction is naturally bounded above , so that @xmath0 can not become arbitrarily large .",
    "therefore our predictions do not depend on a sudden exit from inflation , e.g.  triggered by a hybrid transition , to prevent @xmath0 from growing to an unacceptable value .",
    "equally important , our large signal does not derive from a singularity of the @xmath15-folding history @xmath16 , as a function of its initial conditions .",
    "these means we can rely on a perturbative expansion",
    ". we can simultaneously satisfy observational constraints on the spectral index and tensor fraction .",
    "moreover , this result seems generic .",
    "inflation is self - replicating on top of the hill , sometimes described as ` topological inflation ' @xcite .",
    "coupled with the dispersion of trajectories originating from the vicinity of the hilltop , this implies large non - gaussianity may not be uncommon over a landscape of scalar field vacua .",
