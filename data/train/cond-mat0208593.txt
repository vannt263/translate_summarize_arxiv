    "macroscopic quantum tunneling(mqt ) , the tunneling of a macroscopic variable of a macroscopic system , has recently received much attention in studies of bose - einstein condensation(bec ) .",
    "the tunneling of a condensate through an optical lattice potential @xcite provides an atomic physics analogue of a josephson junction array , while in principle the analogue of a single junction can be realized by two condensates confined in a double well potential@xcite .",
    "the recent experimental success in all - optical trapping of an atomic condensate @xcite opens the prospect of studies into the internal structure of spinor becs , including the possibility of creating some topological excitations @xcite such as skyrmions , monopoles , merons or axis - symmetric or non axis - symmetric vortices both for antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic condensates . among various topological structures ,",
    "the mermin - ho ( mh)@xcite and anderson - toulouse ( at)@xcite coreless non - singular vortices are demonstrated to be thermodynamically stable in ferromagnetic spinor bose - einstein condensates with the hyperfine state @xmath0@xcite .",
    "skyrmions , which do not have an ordinary vortex core due to the spin degree of freedom , are also proposed in the spinor bec @xciteand are shown not to be thermodynamically stable objects without rotation@xcite .",
    "once created , the radius of such a skyrmion shrinks to zero so that one must detect and manipulate it in the duration of its lifetime .    the skyrmion texture in a ferromagnetic spinor condensate can be described conveniently by a position - dependent spinor@xcite @xmath1 the constant spinor @xmath2 is the usual basis that diagonalizes the @xmath3 component of the spin matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a real function of radius @xmath6 satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for the skyrmion with size of the order of the correlation length @xmath9 or less , where @xmath10 is the average atomic density and @xmath11 the @xmath12-wave interatomic scattering length , the problem can be reduced to a nonlinear schrdinger equation by an ansatz for @xmath5 with the gradient term @xmath13 in the gross - pitaevskii energy functional regarded as some external potential @xmath14 . in the spin-1/2 case , for example , the latter takes the form@xcite @xmath15   } { \\left [ 1+\\left ( r/\\lambda \\right ) ^4\\right ] ^4}\\ ] ] for an ansatz @xmath16 $ ] , where the variational parameter @xmath17 corresponds physically to the size of the skyrmion .",
    "the lifetime of the skyrmion is estimated by employing a wkb expression for the tunneling rate @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the action through the barrier and @xmath20 the characteristic frequency of the harmonic potential which was used to approximate the potential @xmath21 . due to the inaccuracy of the prefactor in the tunneling rate , which makes it difficult to give a reliable result for the decay rate ,",
    "more efficient methods are needed for the investigation of this problem .",
    "the instanton method as a powerful tool for dealing with quantum tunneling phenomena has generally been used in the evaluation of the splitting of degenerate ground states or the escape rate from metastable ground states @xcite .",
    "a method of evaluating quantum mechanical tunneling at excited energy states has been developed recently by means of periodic instantons and bounces @xcite , which are characterized by nonzero energy and satisfy manifestly nonvacuum boundary conditions .",
    "solvable models include , level splittings for the double well and sinh - gordon potentials , decay rates for the inverted double well and cubic potentials , and energy band structures of the sine - gordon and lam potentials @xcite .",
    "the off - centered potential barriers serve as another class of physical systems which permit analytical evaluation .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the tunneling behavior of the skyrmion from the core to the outer region through an off - centered barrier .",
    "we first solve the equation of motion in the euclidean version to find the classical configuration , which in our case is a bounce . in section",
    "iii we present the formalism of the periodic instanton theory for tunneling and calculate the decay rate exactly .",
    "the results obtained are applied to estimate the rate of shrinking of the skyrmion in the two - component ferromagnetic bose - einstein condensate .",
    "finally we summarize the main results .",
    "in this section we consider the instanton solution for the tunneling in an off - centered potential barrier as depicted in figure 1 in which the potential @xmath22 takes into account all the main features of the real barriers in the skyrmion excitation in the condensate , both in spin-1/2 and spin-1 condensates , for any reasonable ansatz @xmath5 .",
    "we observe here some essential conditions for this simplified model : first , as a function the ansatz for @xmath23 should decrease monotonically from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , since this will correspond to the smallest gradient energy for the spin deformations ; correspondingly , this excludes any oscillation in the decrease of the potential @xmath21 when @xmath6 tends to @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 should be an off - centered potential barrier with a maximum height @xmath28 at @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the potential should be an even function of @xmath6 , and to avoid the point @xmath31 becoming a singularity , we have @xmath32 so that the harmonic oscillation frequency @xmath20 can be well defined as @xmath33 .",
    "the barrier ( [ voc ] ) is just the simplest form fulfilling the above requirements , with parameter @xmath34 determining the barrier height , parameter @xmath35 the position of the barrier : @xmath36        to estimate the lifetime of the skyrmion , we calculate the tunneling rate from the core to the outer region through a barrier , the core atoms having a chemical potential @xmath37(hereafter abbreviated as @xmath38 ) .",
    "the first step of the instanton method is the so - called wick rotation of a phase space corresponding to a transformation to imaginary time @xmath39 .",
    "after the transformation the lagrangian is replaced by its euclidean counterpart @xmath40 the classical solution @xmath41 which minimizes the corresponding euclidean action satisfies the equation @xmath42 which can be viewed as the equation of motion for a particle of mass @xmath43 with energy @xmath44 in a potential @xmath45 . for the tunneling process in the condensate , we assume that the skyrmion has decreased to a size for which the barrier is so high that the overlap between the core atoms and the external atoms is exponentially small .",
    "the classical turning points on both sides of the barrier can be determined by the relation @xmath46 as suggested in ref .",
    "the reason why we can handle a nonlinear problem by means of a linear equation of motion is that we discuss the tunneling behavior in the barrier region where the nonlinear interaction is negligibly small .",
    "furthermore the condensate at the ground state can be well described by a macroscopic wavefunction with unique phase just as in the single particle case .",
    "however , there are obvious differences between the bec tunneling system and the usual one - body problem , i.e. the nonlinear interaction contributes a finite chemical potential @xmath38 , which replaces the integration constant @xmath48 on the right hand side of eq.([mo ] ) .",
    "the classical configuration is a bounce which is the solution of eq.([mo ] ) and can be expressed in an implicit form @xmath49 here we have assigned a characteristic frequency @xmath50 and the function @xmath51 takes the form @xmath52\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 are two jacobian elliptic functions , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the first and second kind of incomplete elliptic integrals with modulus @xmath57 respectively@xcite , and @xmath58 the solution is subject to the following boundary conditions @xmath59 and exhibits periodic oscillation with imaginary time period @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the first and second kind of complete elliptic integrals with modulus @xmath63 , respectively . in figure 1",
    "we depict the periodic oscillation of this pseudoparticle in two periods .",
    "a remarkable feature of this bounce configuration is that there is no vacuum analogue as in the case of the simple cubic metastable potential , the latter describing the tunneling behavior of a particle located at the ground state .",
    "as the energy @xmath64 ( or the chemical potential @xmath38 ) approaches zero , the barrier will become infinitely thick and the particle confined in the core region will be stable , with no possibility to tunnel to the outer region .",
    "the tunneling rate of the condensate core atoms was given by a simple expression of the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are coefficients which depend on the detailed form of the metastable potential .",
    "the quantity @xmath67 appearing in the exponential is the euclidean action of the bounce solution and gives the dominant contribution to the tunneling rate , while the prefactor @xmath66 originates from the fluctuation around the classical configuration . for a rather rough estimate , @xmath66",
    "is often taken to be the attempt frequency @xmath68 as was done in ref.@xcite . however , as we will show below , this simple evaluation is not accurate .",
    "this paper provides a powerful instanton tool to obtain this prefactor .",
    "we recall for the sake of convenience the main ideas of the periodic instanton approach .",
    "let s first denote the wavefunction of the core atom condensate with chemical potential @xmath38 by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 originates from the density and satisfies the gross - pitaevskii equation for single component @xmath71 the effective external potential @xmath72 @xcite comes from the gradient term of the spinor @xmath13 , and the term with coupling constant @xmath73 represents the strength of the interatomic interactions .",
    "the tunneling effect leads to the decay of the metastable state . in the case under discussion",
    ", the nonconservation of an exponentially small probability current through the barrier requires that the chemical potential has an imaginary part proportional to the decay rate @xcite , @xmath74 .",
    "consider the transition amplitude from the state @xmath75 to itself due to quantum tunneling in euclidean time period @xmath76 .",
    "the amplitude is simply @xmath77 in general the transition amplitude is calculated with the help of the path integral method as @xmath78 where @xmath79 denote the end points of the bounce motion , which tend to the turning points @xmath80 ( see the boundary condition eq .",
    "( [ boundary ] ) ) .",
    "the wave functions @xmath81 in the barrier region are specified in the wkb approximation as@xcite @xmath82 with @xmath83 a normalization constant to be determined below .",
    "the feynman kernel is defined as the summation over all possible classical paths @xmath84@xmath85    we know that the classical solution ( [ bounce ] ) which minimizes the action @xmath86 gives rise to the major contribution to the above kernel integral , while the quantum fluctuation around it results in a prefactor @xmath66 . in the period @xmath76 the bounce eq .",
    "( [ bounce ] ) completes one oscillation and crosses the barrier region twice , back and forth .",
    "the euclidean action is thus calculated in this period as @xmath87 while the so - called abbreviated euclidean action@xcite @xmath88 can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals @xmath89    \\label{w2}\\ ] ] with @xmath90 the complete elliptic integral with the parameter @xmath91 it is obvious from the potential that @xmath92 so @xmath93 , the third elliptic integral is complete and belongs to the case iii@xcite .        the imaginary part of the chemical potential can be derived by considering the amplitude @xmath34 as the sum of contributions from any number of bounces@xcite .",
    "the zero bounce contribution results in the real part of the chemical potential @xmath94 the one bounce contribution comes from the classical configuration with period @xmath76 , and can be obtained by expanding the kernel ( [ kernel ] ) around the bounce ( [ bounce ] ) @xmath95 generalizing to the case of @xmath96 bounces straightforwardly , i.e. , assuming the pseudoparticle completing @xmath96 oscillations in the period @xmath76 , one has @xmath97 the total transition amplitude is given by the sum over all bounce contributions @xmath98 the imaginary part of the chemical potential is obtained by comparing eq.([a ] ) with eq.([aa ] ) @xmath99 which results in the decay rate @xmath100 where the factor @xmath101 comes from the analytical continuation .",
    "physically , this results from the assumption in the decay problem ( and not in the mqc problem ) that the wave that has tunneled will never return .",
    "mathematically , it is due to the fact that the deformed contour runs from @xmath25 to @xmath102 , and not from @xmath103 to @xmath102@xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath83 can be determined from the normalization of the wave function in the classically accessible region , which is connected with those in the barrier region through@xcite @xmath104 we restrict the integration in the classically accessible region , i.e. , in the potential well , @xmath105 , since outside of this range @xmath106 decreases exponentially . because the argument of the cosine in the wave function is a rapidly varying function , we can",
    ", with sufficient accuracy , replace the squared cosine by its mean value 1/2 .",
    "this gives @xmath107 inserting this into the decay rate we have @xmath108 ,    \\label{gama}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the frequency of the classical periodic motion @xmath109 and can be calculated as @xmath110 ^{-1}\\ ] ] with the complementary modulus @xmath111 .",
    "it must be recalled that the frequency @xmath23 is in general different for different levels , being a function of the chemical potential .",
    "we find that our expression for the decay rate eq.([gama ] ) is more accurate than that of refs.@xcite , i.e. , in the prefactor a chemical potential dependent frequency replaces the constant attempt frequency @xmath112 . in figure 2",
    "we show the dependence of this frequency on the chemical potential ; it decreases from @xmath20 as the chemical potential increases from 0 .",
    "this factor suppresses the tunneling rate greatly when the chemical potential approaches the barrier top as shown in the figure , which would be expected to increase the lifetime of the skyrmion .",
    "the skyrmions in a ferromagnetic condensate are energetically unstable as shown in ref .",
    "the time scale on which the skyrmion shrinks may be evaluated for two cases : for a large skyrmion , its size decreases at a rate @xmath113 for @xmath114 spin-1/2 condensate of central density @xmath115 and realistic experimental conditions . for skyrmions with sizes of the order or less than the correlation length @xmath116",
    ", the shrinking rate is determined by the tunneling rate from the core of the skyrmion to the outer region . in previous studies",
    "@xcite the authors estimated roughly the lifetime of this small skyrmion due to the tunneling process employing a wkb expression for the tunneling rate . in this section",
    "we thus reconsider the lifetime using the result derived above , with the modification originating from the prefactor included .    with an ansatz for @xmath117 the problem",
    "is simplified to a nonlinear schrdinger equation with the external potential of the off - centered form . for a different functional behavior of @xmath117",
    "it turns out that the effective potential will not be very different , as long as the ansatz satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath7 and @xmath118 and falls off monotonically .",
    "here we compute the decay rates of different skyrmion textures with the same size , by taking into account two ansatze which were proposed in ref . @xcite as trial functions for simplifying the pair of nonlinear and coupled equations ( eq .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "namely @xmath119 , \\\\ \\omega _",
    "2(\\rho ) & = & \\frac{2\\pi } { 1+(\\rho /\\lambda ) ^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 and @xmath17 corresponds to the size of the skyrmion and is also given in units of @xmath116 .",
    "considering the large distance behavior of the coupling equations for @xmath121 and @xmath122 , we see that for large skyrmions , the density fluctuations scale as @xmath123 , and so should the ansatze for @xmath122 .",
    "this is the reason why we would arrive at a non - physical result for a seemingly reasonable ansatz @xmath124 .",
    "we also check that non - monotonic behavior , i.e. , oscillations in the falling of @xmath122 , for example , @xmath125 ^2 $ ] , will inevitably lead to singularities in the density profile , though the effective potential holds an off - centered form .",
    "we show in figure 3 these ansatze for @xmath117 and their corresponding effective potentials @xmath126 .",
    "one important parameter we should determine is the chemical potential of the core atoms because we should know at which level the atom will tunnel out . in principle one",
    "should solve the two - coupled nonlinear differential equations and derive the density profile and spinor(or the function @xmath117 ) . as mentioned already above",
    ", we employ alternatively a simple approach , i.e. , by introducing the ansatz for @xmath117 .",
    "then from the resulting density distribution we calculate the energy for a particular value of @xmath127 then the core chemical potential can be calculated numerically by differentiating the energy with respect to the number of core atoms . performing the calculation within a thomas - fermi approximation , which means in the expression for the energy we neglect the kinetic energy term , we finally obtain the chemical potential of the core atom @xmath38 for different values of @xmath17 and ansatz .        for the ansatze @xmath128 and @xmath129",
    "we calculate the corresponding chemical potential for @xmath130 .",
    "the shrinking rates of the corresponding skyrmions are calculated according to our decay rate expression eq .",
    "( [ gama ] ) with the action given by eq.([w1 ] ) and the prefactor given by eq.([omega ] ) .",
    "figure 4 gives the tunneling rates as a function of the number of core atoms .",
    "the calculation was performed for a @xmath114 spin-1/2 condensate with a scattering length of @xmath131 .",
    "we observe that @xcite the correction resulting from the accurate prefactor @xmath132 for @xmath128 is minor but significant for @xmath129 . in figure 2",
    "we could generally take the range of the chemical potential from @xmath25 to @xmath133 .",
    "unlike the situation in a harmonic trap where the chemical potential @xmath134 increases with the number of condensed atoms as @xmath135 in the thomas - fermi approximation , in our case @xmath134 decreases with @xmath136 instead .",
    "this is because of the fact that the trap frequency ( for @xmath128 ) @xmath137 is inversely proportional to the equilibrium skyrmion width @xmath138 , which in turn increases with n(apparently faster than @xmath139 ) . here",
    "@xmath138 is determined from minimizing the total energy taking into account the outer region of the skyrmion .",
    "this restricts us to a special domain of @xmath134 . for numbers of core atoms ranging from @xmath140 to @xmath141 , @xmath142 ranges roughly from @xmath143 to @xmath144 . in this interval",
    "@xmath145 starts from @xmath146 for @xmath147 and ends at @xmath148 for @xmath149 , which are almost indistinguishable in figure 4 .",
    "however , for ansatz @xmath129 the chemical potential ( in units of @xmath150 ) starts at @xmath151 for one core atom and ends at @xmath152 for @xmath141 core atoms .",
    "the corresponding correction is shown in figure 4 .",
    "till now there is still no clear experimental evidence for the skyrmions in the condensate . from the above calculations we see that the result for the decay rate depends crucially on the detailed form of the ansatz @xmath153 .",
    "it remains a challenging task to solve the coupled nonlinear equations numerically , and to compare the results with those above .",
    "we present here an accurate calculation of the tunneling rate for a class of off - centered potentials with a periodic instanton method . apart from its application to the study of the stability of the skyrmion excitation in the two - component ferromagnetic condensate ,",
    "the bounce for the off - centered potential barrier is itself a novel configuration from the viewpoint of the scalar field theory .",
    "the exact prefactor of the decay rate has been calculated and we found it depends on the chemical potential at the level of the atoms tunneling to the outer region .",
    "this modifies the result for the rough estimate of the lifetime by a constant attempt frequency @xmath20 .",
    "one can easily find some similar off - centered potentials in other topological excitations such as vortices , monopoles , etc .",
    "our periodic instanton formalism can be extended to the investigation of the lifetime and tunneling behavior in these systems .",
    "further studies should include the properties of the quantum - classical transition of the decay rate when the chemical potential increases and surpasses the barrier height .",
