    "now we show that the mark characteristics introduced in subsect .",
    "[ sect : mark - weighted ] do not suffer from this degeneracy .",

    "there is also a more technical advantage of our method : to estimate the correlation function @xmath30 one has to employ boundary corrections .",
    "quantities like @xmath71 only use conditional probabilities and may be estimated without boundary corrections ( see appendix  [ sect : estimators ] ) , reducing the estimators variance .",
    "the morphology  density relation states that inside clusters , in regions with a high ( surface ) density of galaxies , the abundance of early  type galaxies is enhanced whereas the abundance of late  type galaxies is reduced @xcite .",
    "this relation is very well established , and therefore it seems natural to ask whether the observed luminosity segregation can be explained by the morphology  density relation alone . in this section",
    "we present a number of reasons why this is _ not _ the case .    as a first test we discarded all galaxies in a spherical region with 1.5   and also 3   radius around the apm clusters @xcite , and conduct a analysis similar to the one in subsect .",
    "[ sect : ssrs - luminosity - cont ] restricted to the intersection of the ssrs2 and the apm cluster catalog .",

    "this may not be decisive , since only a few of the ( rich ) apm clusters are included ; however , it supports our view that the observed luminosity segregation is not caused by clusters of galaxies alone .",
    "but in the spirit of the morphology  density relation , one could try to explain the observed luminosity segregation in the following way : the two populations of galaxies , the early and the late  type galaxies , cluster in a different way ( which is , e.g. , manifest in the morphology  density relationship and in the observed morphology segregation sect .",
    "[ sect : ssrs2-morphology ] ) .",
    "if these classes show different average luminosities , the morphology  density relation will generate the luminosity segregation .",
    "this is the main idea behind the two  species model discussed below . a first indication , that this kind of model is not able to explain luminosity segregation , comes from the observation , that both early and the late  type galaxies show very similar luminosity distributions within the volume  limited sample we considered .",

    "this shows that the spatial interplay between different morphological types , as suggested by the morphology  density relation , is only in part responsible for the observed luminosity segregation .",

    "this test does not allow very strong conclusions , since it is based on an ad  hoc division of the whole sample .",
    "a finer division is not feasible , since very few early  type galaxies will populate the subsamples .",
    "however , our results strengthen the interpretation that both sorts of mark correlations are irreducible . neither is the luminosity segregation the source of morphological segregation nor is it the other way around . in particular , the luminous early  type galaxies cluster more strongly than all other galaxies .",
    "the investigation of luminosity and morphology segregation of galaxies has been a scientific task for many years .",
    "our results allow for a new perspective and suggest that both the _ methodology _ and the _ physical interest _ should shift slightly .    methodologically , we discussed luminosity and morphological segregation in the framework of marked point processes .",

    "our main results obtained from the ssrs2 survey are :    * the average luminosity of pairs of galaxies and the fluctuations in the luminosity on each galaxy is enhanced for pairs closer than 15 .",
    "hence , luminosity correlations are scale  dependent , and they are significant even outside clusters of galaxies . on scales larger than 15  our results indicate that neither luminosity nor morphological segregation is present .",
    "* the luminosities of galaxies in pairs closer than 3   show an increased covariance ",
    "close galaxies preferably have similar luminosities . *",

    "the luminosity of a galaxy depends on the local clustering and on interactions with other galaxies .",
    "* there is an interesting feature , a small peak , in @xmath71 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 for galaxy pairs with a separation of approximately @xmath201 , which is currently beyond an explanation .",
    "* we observe morphological segregation between early and late type galaxies for scales smaller than 10 .",
    "this effect is mainly due to highly luminous galaxies .",
    "especially the luminous early  type galaxies seem to play an important role , both for luminosity and morphology segregation . *",
    "the importance of early  type galaxies for luminosity segregation is confirmed by our analysis of the iras samples .",
    "these infrared samples exhibit a deficit in early  type galaxies and consequently show no luminosity segregation . *",
    "an inhomogeneous , scale  invariant galaxy distribution , but without luminosity segregation , can not account for the signal seen in @xmath71 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "the lowered correlation of the dim galaxies , and the enhanced correlation of the luminous galaxies we found , explains at least in part why the amplitude of the correlation function rises if deeper , i.e. , more luminous , galaxy samples are considered .",
    "* with several independent tests we could show that it is not possible to explain the observed luminosity segregation from the morphology  density relation alone .",

    "one basic idea is to construct estimators for @xmath63 from a combination of estimators for the numerator and for the denominator of eq .  .",
    "we first discuss estimators of this type , but then introduce a different estimator , which does not use any boundary conditions .",
    "it turns out , that in our case , this estimator is unbiased and is recommended by its simplicity and low variance .        using these definitions , the ratio  unbiased minus estimator @xmath207 for the weighting functions @xmath61 ( compare eq .  )",

    "the window is effectively shrunken , resulting in an increased variance . on the contrary ,",
    "the following estimator uses all point pairs @xmath210 , however weighted with an geometrical weight @xmath211 .",
    "such weighting schemes lead to ratio  unbiased estimators for the two  point correlation function ( for details see @xcite ) .",

    "indeed we are not investigating the spatial distribution of the points , but `` divide spatial two  point properties out '' .",
    "unfortunately , the unbiasedness of this estimator can not be proven with the common methods used in the theory of point processes , but it seems intuitively clear that this estimator is unbiased . in sect .",
    "[ sect : compare - estimators ] we show this using a numerical example ; we illustrate furthermore that this estimator has preferable variance properties ( this was also observed by @xcite ) .",

    "the sample mean of the estimators coincide with the theoretical mean value for all estimators .",
    "thus , empirically , all estimators are unbiased . in fig .  [",
    "fig : compare - estimators ] the variances of @xmath217 for the different estimators are shown . the variance of the minus estimator becomes unacceptably large especially on large scales .",
    "the estimators using a weighting with the set covariance or the isotropized set covariance show the same small variance , even smaller than the variance of the estimator using a weighting of rivolo ( ripley ) type .",
    "a detailed inspection shows , that the estimator using no boundary correction typically gives the smallest variance .",
    "a qualitatively similar behavior is found for the other mark  correlation functions .",
