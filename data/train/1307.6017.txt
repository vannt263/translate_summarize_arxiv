    "the influence of the rotation of the earth on oceanic and atmospheric currents , as well as the effects of a rapid rotation on the flow inside industrial machineries like mixers , turbines , and compressors , are only the most typical examples of fluid flows affected by rotation . despite the fact that the coriolis acceleration term appears in the navier - stokes equations with a straightforward transformation of coordinates from the inertial system to the rotating non - inertial one , the physical mechanisms of the coriolis acceleration are subtle and not fully understood yet .",

    "the integral time scales derived from the lagrangian velocity correlations give a rough estimate of the time a fluid particle remains trapped inside a large - scale eddy , and therefore it might be used as a lower - bound for the typical lifetime of the large eddies .",
    "lagrangian correlations of velocity have been recognised as the key - ingredient of the process of turbulent diffusion since the work by taylor @xcite . since then , the lagrangian view - point received a growing attention , see for a recent review ref .",
