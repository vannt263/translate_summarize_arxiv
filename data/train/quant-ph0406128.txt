    "it is now believed that entanglement of quantum composite systems with continuous degree of freedom is the basis of most applications in the field of quantum information @xcite .",
    "interest in continuous - variable ( cv ) entanglement is being extensively excited by successful experiments on quantum teleportation based on two - mode squeezed states @xcite as well as the experiments dealing with entanglement in atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "since then , remarkable theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted to generating and quantifying cv entangled states .    in this paper",
    "we propose a novel type of cv entangled states of light - field with reduced phase noise .",
    "they are different from the well - known entangled einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) states generated in a nondegenerate optical amplifier @xcite , which exhibit large phase fluctuations .",
    "we believe that such entangled states of light - field with localized phases can be generated in a self - phase locked nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator ( nopo ) , based on the type - ii phase - matched down - conversion and additional phase locking process stipulated by the intracavity waveplate .",
    "the motivations for this study are the following :    for the first time the cv entangled states of light were studied in @xcite and demonstrated experimentally in @xcite for nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) .",
    "then a cv entanglement source was built from two single - mode squeezed vacuum states combined on a beamsplitter @xcite .",
    "it is well known that each of the orthogonally polarized and frequency degenerate fields generated by nopo is a field of zero - mean values .",
    "the phase sum of generated modes is fixed by the phase of the pump laser , while their phase difference undergoes a phase diffusion process @xcite stipulated by vacuum fluctuations . as a rule ,",
    "the nopo phase diffusion noise is substantially greater than the shot noise level , that limits the usage of nopo in precision phase - sensitive measurements .",
    "various methods based on phase locking mechanisms @xcite have been proposed for reducing such phase diffusion . in the comparatively simple scheme realized in the experiment @xcite",
    ", self - phase locking was achieved in nopo by adding an intracavity quarter - wave plate to provide polarization mixing between two orthogonally polarized modes of the subharmonics . the evidence of self - phase locking was provided there by the high level of phase coherence between the signal and idler fields . following this experiment , the semiclassical theory of such nopo",
    "was developed in @xcite .",
    "recently , the schemes of multiphoton parametric oscillators based on cascaded down - conversion processes in @xmath1 media placed inside the same cavity and showing self - phase locking have been proposed @xcite .",
    "as was demonstrated in @xcite , the system based on combination of opo and second harmonic generation also displays self - phase locking . the formation of self - phase locking and its connection with squeezing in the parametric four - wave mixing under two laser fields has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "an important characteristic of self - phase locked devices concerns the phase structure of generated subharmonics .",
    "indeed , the formation of the variety of distinct phase states under self - phase locked conditions has been obtained in the mentioned refs .",
    "it was recently noted that the schemes involving phase locking are potentially useful for precise interferometric measurements and optical frequency division because they combine fine tuning capability and stability of type - ii phase matching with effective suppression of phase noise .",
    "that is why we believe it will be interesting to consider phase locked dynamics also from the perspective of quantum optics and , in particular , from the standpoint of production of cv entanglement .",
    "a further motivation for such task is connected with the problem of experimental generation of bright entangled light .",
    "so far , to the best of our knowledge , there is no experimental demonstration of cv entanglement above the threshold of nopo .",
    "the progress in experimental study of bright two - mode entangled state from cw nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier has been made in @xcite .",
    "the theoretical investigation of cv entangled light in transition through the generation threshold of nopo is given in @xcite .",
    "one of the principal experimental difficulties in advance toward a high - intensity level is the impossibility to control the frequency degeneration of modes above the threshold .",
    "we hope that the usage of phase locked nopo may open a new interesting possibility to avoid this difficulty .",
    "in this paper we report what is believed to be the first investigation of self - phase locked cv entangled states .",
    "we develop the quantum theory of self - phase locked nopo , with decoherence included , in application to the generation of such entangled states .",
    "this scheme is based on the combination of two processes , namely , type - ii parametric down - conversion and linear polarization mixing with cavity - induced feedback .",
    "the parametric down - conversion is a standard technique used to produce an entangled photon pairs as well as cv two - mode squeezed states @xcite .",
    "the beam splitter including polarization mixer are also considered as experimentally accessible devices for production of entangled light - fields @xcite .",
    "besides these , there have been some studies of a beam splitter for various nonclassical input states , including two - mode squeezing states @xcite .",
    "it is obvious , and also follows from the results of the mentioned papers @xcite , that the operational regimes of the combined system with cavity - induced feedback and dissipation drastically differ from those for pure processes .",
    "we show below that analogous situation takes place in the investigation of quantum - statistical properties of a combined system such as the self - phase locked nopo .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulate the model of combined nopo based on the processes of two - photon splitting and polarization mixing , and present a semiclassical analysis of the system .",
    "section iii is devoted to the analysis of quantum fluctuations of both modes within the framework of linearization procedure around the stable steady - state .",
    "in section iv we investigate the cv entangling resources of self - phase locked nopo on the base of two - mode squeezing for both sub - threshold and above - threshold operational regimes .",
    "we also discuss in section iv the case of unitary , non - dissipative dynamics using a well justified small - interaction time approximation .",
    "we summarize our results in section v.",
    "as an entangler we consider the combination of two processes in a triply resonant cavity , namely , the type - ii parametric down - conversion in @xmath2- medium and polarization mixing between subharmonics in lossless symmetric quarter - wave plate .",

    "the mode @xmath6 at frequency @xmath7 is driven by an external field with amplitude @xmath8 and phase @xmath9 , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe subharmonics of two orthogonal polarizations at degenerate frequencies @xmath12 .",
    "the constant @xmath13 determines the efficiency of the down - conversion process .",
    "linear coupling constant denoted as @xmath14describes the energy exchange between only the subharmonic modes and besides , @xmath15 is determined by the amount of polarization rotation due to the intracavity waveplate , @xmath16 determines the phase difference between the transformed modes .",
    "we take into account the detunings of subharmonics @xmath17 and the cavity damping rates @xmath18 and consider the case of high cavity losses for pump mode ( @xmath19 ) , when this mode can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "however , in our analysis we take into account the pump depletion effects .",
    "the principal scheme of this device , the so - called self - phase locked nopo , is shown on fig .",
    "[ scheme ] for the special configuration when the coupling of in- and out - radiation fields occurs at one of the ring cavity mirrors .",
    "note , that the comparison of this configuration with the analogous one considered in @xcite , where the pump field is a travelling wave , is discussed below .    due to explicit presence of dissipation in this problem",

    "that leads to cancellation of the phases on the intermediate stages of calculations . as a result",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath28 depends only on real - valued coupling constants .    in order to proceed further",

    "moreover , analogous symmetry @xmath31 = 0 $ ] takes place for the density operator of the system , which obeys the master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) . using this symmetry",
    "we establish the following selection rules for the normal - ordered moments of the mode operators of the subharmonics : @xmath32 if @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "another peculiarity of  nopo with hamiltonian ( [ originalh ] ) is displayed in the phase space of each of the subharmonic modes .",
    "the reduced density operator for each of the modes is constructed from the density operator @xmath20 by tracing over the other modes @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",

    "these results are in accordance with the ones obtained in @xcite , but for another configuration of nopo . in the scheme proposed in @xcite",
    "only the signal and idler modes are excited in the cavity , while the pump field is a travelling wave .",

    "so , the set of above - threshold stable solutions for both modes have two - fold symmetry in the phase - space which was indeed expected from symmetry arguments ( [ wignersymmetry ] ) .",

    "it should also be emphasized at this stage that in the above - threshold regime of self - phase locked nopo the steady - state phases of each of the modes are well - defined in contrast to what happens in the case of ordinary nopo , where phase diffusion takes place . according to this effect",

    "this result is not at all trivial for the system considered , even in the absence of dissipation and cavity - induced feedback , because the insertion of polarization mixer usually destroys the two - mode squeezing produced by nondegenerate parametric down - conversion .",

    "it should also be mentioned that the result ( [ vminabove ] ) is expressed through the scaled pump field amplitude @xmath281 and hence depends on coupling constants @xmath282 and @xmath15 .",
    "we stress , that the level of two - mode squeezing in the proposed scheme is limited due to the dissipation and pump depletion effects and reaches only @xmath0 relative to the level of vacuum fluctuations if the pump intensity draw near to the generation threshold . such limitation on the level of intracavity",
    "two - mode squeezing takes place also for the ordinary nopo as was been demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite by analysis of quantum fluctuations in the near - threshold range .",
    "analogous conclusion has been made for one - mode squeezed light generated in opo @xcite .",

    "however , for such selection of the phases we arrive at @xmath299 it is easy to check that the product of the variances exceeds @xmath300 even in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "this quantity for both operational regimes is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vplusmulvminus_fig ] .",
    "it should be noted again that a detailed analysis of this problem , must include more accurate consideration of quantum fluctuations in the critical ranges .",
    "our work demonstrates the possibility of creation of cv entangled states of light beams in the presence of phase localizing processes .",
    "we have called such quantum states the entangled self - phase locked states of light @xcite and we have shown that they can be generated in nopo recently realized in the experiment @xcite .",
    "this device is based on the type - ii phase - matched down - conversion and additional phase localizing mechanisms stipulated by the intracavity waveplate .",
    "the novelty is that this device provides high level of phase coherence between the subharmonics in contrast to what happens in the case of ordinary nopo , where the phase diffussion takes place .",
    "we have shown that both two mode squeezing and quantum phase locking phenomena are combined in such nopo . this development paves the way towards the generation of bright cv entangled light beams with well - localized phases .",
    "it looks like that this scheme involving phase locking may be potentially useful for precise interferometric measurements and quantum communications , because it combines quantum entanglement and stability of type - ii phase matching with effective suppression of phase noise .",
    "particularly , in practice , this phase locked scheme can effectively be used in homodyne detection setups , as well as for observation of an interference with nonclassical light beams .",
    "we believe , that such source of bright entangled light providing phase coherence will also be applicable for realizing cv quantum teleportation .",
    "the price one has to pay for these advantages is the small aggravation of the degree of cv entanglement in self - phase locked nopo in comparison with the case of ordinary nopo . the quantum theory of self - phase locked nopo has been developed in linear treatment of quantum fluctuations for both below- and above - threshold regimes of generation .",
    "we have studied the cv entanglement as two - mode squeezing and have shown that entanglement is present in the entire range of pump intensities . in all cases the maximal degree of two - mode squeezing @xmath268 is achieved in the vicinity of the threshold , provided that the coupling constant @xmath15 is much less than the mode detunings .",
    "we have demonstrated that , as a rule , highest degree of cv entanglement occurs for weak linear coupling strength @xmath15 .",
    "it has also been shown that the amount of the entanglement can be controlled via the phase difference @xmath216 .",
    "the other peculiarities of the system of interest have been established for the case of unitary dynamics which may be realized for the short interaction times in the case of pulsed pump fields .",
    "one of these concerns the presence of two operational regimes generating two - mode squeezing .",
    "if the linear coupling between subharmonics dominates over the parametric down - conversion , @xmath301 , we have observed a periodic evolution of the squeezed variance .",
    "maximal degree of squeezing has been @xmath268 in this regime .",
