    "control loops in a practical network contain channels over which only a finite number of bits can be transmitted . due to such limited transmission capacity , we should quantize data before sending them out through a network . however , large quantization errors lead to the deterioration of control performance . one way to reduce quantization errors under data - rate constraints",
    "is to exploit output estimates as quantization centers . in this paper , we adopt luenberger observers as output estimators due to their simple structure and aim to design an encoding strategy for stabilization .",
    "a fundamental limitation of data rate for stabilization was first obtained by @xcite , and inspired by this result , data - rate limitations were studied for linear time - invariant systems in @xcite , for stochastic systems in @xcite , and for uncertain systems in @xcite . although the so - called zooming - in and zooming - out encoding method developed in @xcite provides only sufficient conditions for stabilization , this encoding procedure is simple and hence was extended , e.g. , to nonlinear systems in @xcite , to systems with external disturbances in @xcite , and recently to switched / hybrid systems in @xcite .",
    "readers are referred to the survey papers by @xcite , and the books by @xcite on this topic for further information .",
    "although luenberger observers has been widely used for quantized output feedback stabilization , e.g. , in @xcite , state estimates was exploited only to generate control inputs , and a quantization center was the origin .",
    "however , to reduce quantization errors , output estimates play an important role as quantization centers .",
    "the notable exception is the studies by @xcite .",
    "the class of observers in these studies covers a luenberger observer whose estimate is initialized by a pseudo - inverse observer , and @xcite provided a sufficient condition for stabilization with unbounded disturbances .",
    "however , this condition is not easily verifiable for the case of luenberger observers .",
    "furthermore , these studies placed assumptions that input quantization is ignored and that encoders contain state estimators for sharing quantization centers with controllers .    in this paper , we present an output encoding method for the stabilization of sampled - data systems with discrete - time luenberger observers . the proposed encoding method is based on the zooming - in technique and employs estimates generated from a luenberger observer for both stabilization and quantization . first we consider only output quantization and assume that encoders also contain estimators .",
    "simple sufficient conditions for stabilization are obtained in the both case of general luenberger observers and of deadbeat observers .",
    "second we generalize the results of general luenberger observers to the situation where both of the plant input and output are quantized .",
    "moreover , in the second case , encoders do not estimate the plant state by themselves , but controllers send the quantized estimate of the plant output to the encoders .",
    "in contrast with the quantization of the plant output , we quantize the plant input and the output estimate by using the origin as the quantization center , which reduces computational resources in the components of the plant side . we see that if the closed - loop system without quantization is stable , then there exists an encoding method such that the closed - loop system in the presence of three types of quantization errors is also stable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we study the case when only the plant output is quantized and obtain two data - rate conditions for general luenberger observers and deadbeat observers . in section 3 ,",
    "the proposed encoding method is extended to the case when both of the plant input and output are quantized .",
