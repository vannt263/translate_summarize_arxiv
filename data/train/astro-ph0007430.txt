    "the asca hard serendipitous survey ( hss ) is a systematic search for sources in the @xmath0 kev band using data from the gis2 instrument on board the asca observatory .",
    "the specific aims of this project , initiated a few years ago at the _ osservatorio astronomico di brera _ , are : a ) to investigate the census of the x - ray sources shining in the hard x - ray sky down to a flux limit of @xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 , b ) to study their x - ray spectral properties , c ) to test the unification model for agn and d ) to evaluate the contribution to the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) from the different classes of x - ray sources . finally , this sample of 2 - 10 kev selected sources , along with other complete samples from asca and bepposax survey programs ( ueda et al .",
    ", 1999a , b ; giommi , perri and fiore , 2000 ) will be of fundamental importance in the next few years : a ) to fix the bright tail of the much deeper chandra and xmm - newton number counts relationship and b ) to provide sources bright enough for detailed x - ray follow up studies .",
    "the data considered for the asca hss were extracted from the public archive of 1629 asca fields ( as of december 18 , 1997 ) .",
    "the fields selection criteria , the data preparation and analysis , the source detection and selection and the computation of the sky coverage are described in detail in the  pilot \" paper ( cagnoni , della ceca and maccacaro , 1998 ) and in della ceca et al . ( 1999a ) . in summary , we have considered 300 gis2 images suitable for this project ( e.g. at high galactic latitude , not centered on bright or extended targets , not centered on groups or associations of targets , etc .. ) , using only the events in the energy range and within 20 arcmin from the detector center .",
    "these images have been searched for sources with a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio greater than 4.0 ( a more restrictive criterion than that adopted in the  pilot \" paper of cagnoni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) where a s / n @xmath4 3.5 was used ) . a sample of 189 serendipitous sources with fluxes in the range @xmath5 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 has been defined .",
    "the sky coverage is a function of the flux and it ranges from @xmath6 deg@xmath7 for @xmath8 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 , to @xmath9 deg@xmath7 for @xmath10 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 and to @xmath11 deg@xmath7 for @xmath12 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ; the total area of sky covered by the asca hss is @xmath13 deg@xmath7 . up to now 58 sources have been spectroscopically identified .",
    "the optical breakdown is the following : 1 star , 5 cluster of galaxies , 5 bl lacs , 40 broad line type 1 agn , and 7 narrow line type 2 agn .",
    "however we stress that this sample of identified objects is probably not representative of the whole population .",
    "full details on the asca hss source sample will be reported in della ceca at al .",
    "( 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "in figure 1 we summarize the results from different survey programs obtained using asca and _ beppo_sax data in the flux range between @xmath16 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 and @xmath17 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "extension of the logn(@xmath15s ) - logs down to @xmath18 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 , is discussed in giacconi et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) .",
    "= 11.5 cm    it can be seen that the different results are in good agreement and this is reassuring given the different instruments and/or data analysis utilized from the various groups .",
    "the asca hss logn(@xmath15s)-logs can be described by a power law model n(@xmath15s ) = @xmath19 with best fit values ( @xmath20 ) of @xmath21 and @xmath22 deg@xmath23 ( note that k is not a fit parameter but is obtained by rescaling the model to the actual number of objects in the sample ) .",
    "the fit , performed over the flux range @xmath24 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 @xmath14 @xmath25 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ( the faintest detectable flux ) , is in very good agreement with our previous computations ( e.g. cagnoni et al . , 1998 ,",
    "della ceca et al . , 1999b ) and with the _",
    "beppo_sax results ( giommi , perri and fiore , 2000 ) . at the flux limit of the asca hss survey ( @xmath26 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 )",
    "the total emissivity of the resolved objects is @xmath27 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 deg@xmath23 , i.e. about 20% of the 2 - 10 kev cxb emissivity recently obtained from vecchi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) using _ beppo_sax data .",
    "to investigate the spectral properties of the sources in the 2 @xmath14 10 kev range we defined the hardness ratio , @xmath28 , where m and h are the observed net counts in the 2@xmath144 kev and 4@xmath1410 kev energy band respectively ( see della ceca et al.,1999a for details ) .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm    figure 2a ( hr2 vs. gis2 count rate ) shows a flattening of the mean spectrum of the sources with decreasing count rate as well as a large spread in the hr2 ( or @xmath29 ) distribution ; this spread is the result of the convolution of the parent distribution with the measurement error distribution . to disentangle these two distributions",
    "we have applied the maximum likelihood method as explained in maccacaro et al . , 1988 .",
    "the results on the  faint \" and on the  bright \" subsets are reported in figure 2b .",
    "we clearly detect a flattening of the intrinsic mean spectral properties of the sources which is significant at more than 99% confidence level .",
    "our results on the mean energy index for the faint subset are in good agreement with those obtained from ueda et al .",
    ", 1999a in a similar flux range ( @xmath30 ) , while the results on the bright sample are in good agreement with the ginga results ( see della ceca et al .",
    ", 1999a and reference therein ) .",
    "we have cross - correlated the asca hss sources with existing rosat images ( pspc , hri ) and with the rass catalogs .",
    "only 11 of the 129 asca hss sources , for which we have adequate rosat data , do not have a clear soft x - ray counterpart ( all but 2 with @xmath31 ) ; therefore we do not find a compelling evidence for a large ( @xmath32 ) population of 2 - 10 kev sources undetectable below a few kev ( see also giommi , perri and fiore , 2000 for a similar results from the _ beppo_sax 2 - 10 kev survey ) . in the popular and largely accepted absorbed agn scenario ,",
    "this result implies that soft spectral components must be present even in strongly absorbed objects as already stated from giommi , fiore and perri , 1999 and della ceca et al .",

    "-0.25 cm this work received partial financial support from murst ( cofin-98 - 02 - 32 ) . we thank p. giommi and m. perri for helping us on the computation of the errors in the integral representation of the logn - logs and we thank a. wolter having been able to retrieve , after 13 years , the ml code for the compution of the mean spectral properties ."
