    "the gas not only falls into the black hole , but can also be lifted off the accretion disc under some mechanisms in powerful winds / outflows .",
    "outflows seem to be the fundamental component of quasar systems , and are present in at least 50 per cent of optically selected quasars ( crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 ; ganguly & brotherton 2008 ; nestor , hamann & rodrguez hidalgo 2008 ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that the outflows play an important role in regulating the growth of supermassive black holes by carrying away the angular momentum ( silk & rees 1998 ; king 2003 ) . moreover",
    ", the outflows might inject enough kine - matic energy and metal - rich gas into the host galaxies , influencing the star formation , the enrichment of the surrounding intergalactic medium , and so on ( e.g. di matteo , springel & hernquist 2005 ; bower et al .",
    "2006 ; moll et al . 2007 ; dunn et al . 2012 ) . therefore , it is important to understand the properties and evolution of quasar outflows",
    ".    unfortunately , the nature and origin of quasar outflows are still mysterious .",
    "some models suggest that the quasar outflows are physically related to the gas lifted off the accretion disc , which would be driven by the radiation pressure , magnetic fores , or a combination of these ( arav , li & begelman 1994 ; de kool & begelman 1995 ; murray et al . 1995 ; murray & chiang 1997 ; proga , stone & kallman 2000 ; everett 2005 ) . here , the radiation pressure seems to play a dominant role ( laor & brandt 2002 ; hamann et al .",
    "the quasar outflows are detected most conspicuously via blueshifted metal absorption lines .",
    "these absorption lines imprint on the quasar spectra in different forms based on linewidths : broad absorption lines ( bals ) with absorption troughs that are broader than @xmath4 at depths @xmath5 per cent below the continuum ; narrow absorption lines ( nals ) with velocity widths of a few hundred @xmath6 ; intermediate width absorption lines ( mini - bals ; e.g. weymann et al .",

    "it is possible that the different types of lines arise in the same quasar outflow but are viewed at different angles ( murray et al .",
    "alternatively , they might be formed in the same quasar outflow but at different evolutionary stages , where nals and mini - bals appear near the beginning or end stages of a more powerful bal outflow ( e.g. hamann & sabra 2004 ; hamann et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "bals are undoubtedly intrinsic to quasars .",
    "therefore , many pre - vious studies of outflow absorption lines have focused on bals ( e.g. gibson et al .",

    "2009 ; capellupo et al .",

    "this would induce a variation in the ionization states of the absorbing gas and/or the proper motion of absorbers , which could give rise to changes in the column density or changes in covering factors .",

    "the value of the column density ( @xmath72 ) of this @xmath109 absorber is @xmath111 , which is much larger than the low limit value of the @xmath81 absorbers ( @xmath112 ) . adopting the bolometric correction factor",
    ", one can roughly compute the monochromatic luminosity at 3000    from the bolometric luminosity of the @xmath113 ( shen et al .",
    "2011 ) , and plot the @xmath105 ultra - fast outflow in the @xmath102  @xmath103 plane ( see the filled circle shown in fig .",
    "4 ) . we can see from fig .",
    "4 that the @xmath105 ultra - fast outflow lies well above the upper envelope curve , which is significantly different from the @xmath81 outflow of this work . therefore",
    ", the magnetohydrodynamic mechanism might dominate the @xmath109 ultra fast outflow ( gupta et al .",
    "2013b ) , unlike the radiation - pressure mechanism linked to the @xmath81 outflow .",
    "although some properties of the o vi ultra - fast outflow and the c iv outflow display obvious differences , the similar velocities and ionization levels might lead us to investigate the connection between the absorption lines in the uv spectra and those in the x - ray spectra .",
    "this precise connection would be complicated and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the quasar j095254.10 + 021932.8 with @xmath69 was observed by sdss - i / ii on 30 december 2000 , and reobserved by sdss - iii on 25 march 2011 .",
    "the time interval of the two observations is 1186.4 days at quasar rest - frame .",
    "we find that two @xmath114 narrow absorption systems , which are respectively located at @xmath0 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath64 ) , are obviously imprinted on the sdss - iii spectrum .",
    "however , these two absorption systems can not be observed from the sdss - i / ii spectrum . with respect to the quasar ,",
    "the velocities offset is @xmath115 for the @xmath24 , and @xmath3 for the @xmath64 .",
    "we also find that both the two absorbers partially occult the background emission sources .",
    "the effective coverage fraction is @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the @xmath24 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the stabilities of the continuum radiations and the broad emission lines of the quasar j095254.10 + 021932.8 suggest that the dramatic variations of absorption troughs are unlikely to be caused by the changes in the ionization state of the absorbing gas .",
    "in addition , considering the time interval of the two sdss observations , a new outflow scenario , arising from the situation where there was pre - viously no outflow at all , can not account for the line variations of both the r - component and b - component .",
    "the multiple streaming gas moving across our sightline might be the best explanation for the emergence of the two c iv absorption systems . adopting the time interval of the two sdss observations as the upper limit of the absorber transit time",
    ", we estimate the lower limits of the transverse velocity perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "this gives rise to velocities of @xmath116 for the @xmath24 and @xmath117 for the @xmath64 .",
    "assuming that the shift velocities of the absorbers do not exceed the escape velocities , the distances of the absorbers relative to the central region are @xmath118 for the @xmath24 , and @xmath119 for the @xmath64 .",
    "these absorbers might lie in the vicinity of the broad emission line region of the quasar ( @xmath120 ) .",
