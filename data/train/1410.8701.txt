    "the measurement of the arrival time of a quantum mechanical particle in a given detection region is a longstanding and fundamental problem in quantum mechanics @xcite . in spite of much effort",
    ", the construction of a time operator has been found to be controversial @xcite .",
    "one possible approach that one could take to find the time of arrival is the following .",
    "suppose that a particle is released from a given region at time @xmath1 and is allowed to evolve unitarily with some hamiltonian . in some specified detection region",
    "we make repeated instantaneous , projective measurements , at regular time intervals @xmath0 , to see if the particle has arrived there , and we stop once a detection is made .",
    "if the detection occurs at the @xmath2 measurement , we could say that the particle s time of arrival into the detection region , is at time @xmath3 ( or more precisely between times @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "repeated measurements of this kind are known to have a somewhat surprising feature when one considers the limit where the time interval between measurements @xmath0 is taken to zero .",
    "one finds that the probability of detecting the particle goes to zero ; this is called the quantum zeno effect @xcite .    an interesting case to consider",
    "is one where the time @xmath0 between measurements is assumed to be small compared to the typical spreading time of a wave packet ( in the models that we will study , the spreading time is of the order of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the hopping amplitude between nearest neighbors ) , but _ is kept finite and we do not take the limit @xmath8_. the problem of the effect of repeated measurements , made at finite time intervals , on the evolution of a quantum system has been studied in various contexts both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . because of the probabilistic nature of the quantum detection process , we expect the time of detection to be a stochastic variable . the probability distribution of this time of first detection of the particle in some given region , and the complementary probability of not being detected ( i.e. , survival ) at all up to some time , are then interesting quantities to study .",
    "the time evolution of the wave function of a surviving particle is also of interest .    in an earlier paper @xcite",
    ", we addressed this problem taking the example of a particle moving on a one - dimensional lattice with a tight - binding hamiltonian , with detections made at a single site .",
    "this paper extends our earlier work in several directions .",
    "we consider here the motion of a single particle on an arbitrary lattice , with the dynamics still controlled by a tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "also , we allow our projective measurements to be made on more than one site in a region . through a general perturbative treatment ,",
    "valid when the time interval between measurements is small compared to the wave spreading time scale , we show that the long time dynamics of the particle can be effectively described by a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "the non - hermitian hamiltonian is defined on the subspace consisting of non - measurement sites and contains a small imaginary potential on all the sites that are connected directly by hopping to the measurement sites . using this result ,",
    "we are able to solve for the time evolution of initially localized wave functions and from this , analytically compute the survival probability for several examples of particles in one- and two - dimensional lattices .",
    "our analytic results are compared with direct numerical results and we find excellent agreement .",
    "we find that the survival probability decays as a power of the time , where the power depends on the initial position of the particle .",
    "finally , we demonstrate another mapping that can be made between the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian with a small imaginary potential that appears in our model , and a different non - hermitian hamiltonian which has a large imaginary potential on the measurement sites .",
    "this second non - hermitian hamiltonian is similar to what has been proposed in the context of the study of the time of arrival of a free quantum particle ( moving in continuous space ) into a given region ( the half line ) , using the approach of repeated measurements @xcite .",
    "this also relates our study to a recent work of krapivsky _ et al _",

    "analytical and numerical results are presented .",
    "we also present ( sec .  [",
    "sec : mf ] ) an exact solution for a mean field type of model where the particle can hop from any site to all the other sites .",
    "[ sec : pert2 ] describes the mapping between the non - hermitian hamiltonian problem with a large imaginary potential at the measurement sites and our problem with small measurement time intervals .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "our model consists of a particle moving on a discrete lattice of @xmath10 sites and its dynamics is described by a tight - binding type hamiltonian of the form h= _",
    "^n h_r , s  |rs|  , [ ham ] where @xmath11 is taken to be a real symmetric matrix whose non - vanishing elements have strength @xmath7 ( in units of @xmath12 )",
    ". the free time evolution of @xmath13 is given by |(t ) = u_t |(0 ) ,  where   u_t = e^-i h t  .",
    "let us define the projection operator @xmath14 corresponding to a measurement to detect the particle in the domain @xmath15 containing a fixed number @xmath16 of sites , and the complementary operator @xmath17 corresponding to the projection to the space of @xmath18 sites belonging to the `` system '' . according to the measurement postulate of quantum mechanics , the probability of detecting the particle on performing a measurement on the state @xmath19 is @xmath20 .",
    "the probability of non - detection or the _ survival probability _ is then @xmath21 .",
    "the measurement postulate also tells us about the state of the system immediately after the measurement .",
    "they in fact alter the hamiltonian time evolution of the system .",
    "if the measurement detects the particle ( with probability @xmath22 ) then the state after measurement is @xmath23 , while if a measurement _ does not _ detect the particle ( with probability @xmath24 ) , then the state immediately after measurement is @xmath25 , with appropriate normalizations .",
    "thus we see that after the measurement the system is effectively described by a density matrix latexmath:[$\\rho'=a |\\psi\\ra \\la \\psi     experiment whenever a particle is detected_. hence only those states that are projected onto the system subspace are further evolved , and we do not need to consider density matrices .",
    "after the first measurement we again unitarily evolve the state @xmath25 until the next measurement .",
    "we consider a sequence of measurements @xmath27 at intervals of time @xmath0 which continue until a particle is detected .",
    "_ thus the time evolution is given by a sequence of unitary evolutions followed by projections , onto the subspace corresponding to @xmath28 , till the particle is detected_. let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be the ( un - normalized ) wave functions of the system , immediately before and after the @xmath2 measurement respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "hence , defining @xmath33 , it follows that |^-_n = u_^n-1 |(0 )  and     survival after @xmath34 measurements",
    ". then clearly p_1 = ^-_1|b | ^-_1 = ( 0)| ^| ( 0 ) = ^+_1|^+_1  .",
    "note that @xmath35 is thus the normalizing factor for @xmath36 and also for @xmath37 .",
    "the survival probability after the second measurement is obtained as the product of non - detection at @xmath38 times the probability of non - detection at @xmath39 , and is given by p_2 = p_1 b = ( 0)| ^2 ^2 |(0 ) = ^+_2| ^+_2  .proceeding iteratively in this way , we get p_n = ( 0)| ^n ^n |(0 ) = ^+_n| ^+_n  .[ps ] if we imagine an ensemble of identically prepared states on which we perform repeated measurements , then @xmath40 gives the fraction of systems for which there has been no detection and that are still evolving .",
    "the probability of first detection in the @xmath2 measurement is given by @xmath41 as expected .",
    "our main aim in the rest of the paper is to study the behavior of the survival probability for different cases . from the discussion above it is clear that the central problem is to understand the properties of the effective evolution operator @xmath42 which",
    ", for initial states located inside the `` system '' , is equivalently given by b e^-i h b  .",
    "an explicit diagonalization of this non - hermitian evolution operator is difficult in general . in the next section we provide a perturbative approach , valid for small @xmath43 .",
    "as we will see from our numerical results , this gives a quite accurate description .",
    "let us use the following notation : we divide our full set of sites into those belonging to the `` system '' ( labeled by roman indices @xmath44 ) and those belonging to the domain @xmath15 consisting of sites where measurements are made ( denoted by greek indices @xmath45 ) .",
    "with this notation we have @xmath46 and @xmath47 , while the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) can be rewritten in the following form @xmath48 describe the system , measurement sites and coupling parts respectively of the full hamiltonian .",
    "expanding the effective evolution operator @xmath49 to second order in @xmath0 gives in the system subspace , @xmath50~b \\nn \\\\ & = i - ih_s \\tau -\\f{\\tau^2}{2 } h_s^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & -\\f{\\tau^2}{2 } \\sum_{l , m } \\sum_\\alpha   v_{l,\\alpha}v_{\\alpha , m } |l\\ra \\la m| + \\ldots \\nn \\\\ & = e^{-i h_{eff } \\tau}+{\\mathcal{o}}(\\tau^3 ) , \\nn \\\\ { \\rm where}~~h_{eff}&=h_s+v_{eff } , \\label{effh } \\\\ { \\rm and}~~v_{eff}&=-\\f{i \\tau}{2 } \\sum_{l , m } \\sum_\\alpha v_{l,\\alpha } v_{\\alpha , m } |l\\ra \\la m| ~. \\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath51 denotes the @xmath52 unit matrix ) .",
    "thus we see that our system is effectively described by a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath53 and the problem now reduces to diagonalizing this hamiltonian .",
    "note in particular that the strength of the non - hermitian potential is small and proportional to the measurement interval @xmath0 . in the following section we will give explicit examples on regular lattices in one and two dimensions where",
    "this reduced problem can be tackled analytically , and comparisons can be made with direct numerical solutions of the original problem .",
    "we consider the motion of a quantum particle in a one - dimensional lattice with only nearest neighbor hoppings and open boundary conditions .",
    "the corresponding full hamiltonian is @xmath54 without loss of generality we set @xmath55 .",

    "[ sec : pert ] we discussed a mapping of the dynamics of the system under repeated measurements to another effective non - hermitian hamiltonian . let us clarify the difference between that and the one discussed in this section , in the context of the special case of a one - dimensional @xmath10-site chain with open boundary conditions .",
    "for this case we have proved that the dynamics under repeated measurements at the @xmath10-th site at time intervals @xmath0 , is identical to the dynamics of both an open chain of @xmath10 sites with a strong imaginary potential @xmath238 placed at the @xmath10-th site ( see eq .",

    "( [ nh - ham ] ) and ( [ h_add ] ) ) .",
    "a corollary of this observation is that the dynamics of an open @xmath10-site chain with a strong potential @xmath241 at the @xmath10-th site is equivalent to that of an open @xmath239-site chain with a weak potential @xmath242 at the @xmath239-th site .",
    "we have used a tight - binding model ( with a hopping amplitude @xmath7 ) for a particle on a lattice to study the problem of first detection and survival under repeated measurements at a given site or a set of sites .",
    "the measurements are made at intervals of time @xmath0 .",
    "we develop a non - unitary evolution which describes the probability of first detection of the particle at time @xmath5 and , equivalently , the non - detection or survival of the particle up to the time @xmath5 .",
    "we summarize our results below .    due to the frequent projective measurements made on the system ,",
    "the wave function evolution is non - unitary .",
    "we have shown , using a perturbative approach , that the dynamics can be described by an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian , which makes the problem analytically tractable .",
    "for a one - dimensional system with either open or periodic boundary conditions and a detector placed at a single site , we derive an analytical expression for the survival probability up to a time @xmath5 using perturbation theory when @xmath0 is much smaller than the inverse of the band width ( proportional to @xmath7 ) . if @xmath5 is held fixed , we find that the detection probability vanishes in the limit @xmath8 ; this is the quantum zeno effect .",
    "next , we show that the survival probability generally decays as a power of @xmath5 for a certain range of values of @xmath5 .",
    "the power depends on the initial position of the particle , namely , whether it is near the detecting point or far away from it ; we derive an interpolating function which varies from one power law to the other as the initial position is changed .",
    "( interestingly , for periodic boundary conditions , we find that the survival probability generally approaches a non - zero constant as @xmath243 ) .",
    "we also find the spatial distribution of the particle when it is not detected and show that it approaches a simple form as @xmath243 .",
    "we then consider a number of generalizations of the model .",
    "if we consider an open chain with a number of detection points at one end , we find that the system effectively behaves like a shorter open chain with a single detection point at one end .",
    "we study an open chain with a detection point at each end and show that the scaling behavior of the survival probability is similar to that of an open chain with one detection point .",
    "we have also studied a particle moving on a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "the tight - binding model on this system behaves like a product of two decoupled one - dimensional models in the @xmath135 and @xmath136 directions .",
    "hence , the cases in which the detecting sites lie along one edge , two edges ( which can be adjacent or opposite to each other ) , three edges or all four edges , can be mapped to a product of two open chains each of which has a single detecting site at one or both ends . as a result the survival probability and its scaling with time can be derived easily in all these cases .",
    "we have then examined a mean field model where the particle can hop between any pair of sites with the same amplitude . in this system , we find that the survival probability is generally finite in the large @xmath5 limit .    finally , we have pointed out an interesting connection between our problem and another recent work  @xcite on the survival probability of a particle on a one - dimensional lattice with an imaginary potential at one or more sites .",
    "the latter study uses a non - hermitian and time - independent hamiltonian in which the potential on a set of sites ( which corresponds to the detection sites in our formalism ) is imaginary and has a value @xmath217 ; hence the particle can get absorbed there which is the equivalent of getting detected in our language .",
    "we show that the two approaches give identical results if @xmath0 is much smaller than the inverse band width @xmath6 , @xmath244 , and @xmath221 .",
    "we can consider various extensions of this work for future studies .",
    "it may be interesting to look at many - body systems and investigate the effect of repeated measurements at one point on the particle distribution near that point and to see if measurements can give rise to quantum entanglement",
    ". it would also be interesting to look at the effect of measurements of observables other than the position , such as the momentum or the spin .",
