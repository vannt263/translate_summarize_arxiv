    "the discovery of the pulsar psr j1745 - 2900  at a projected separation of 0.1 pc from the massive black hole in the galactic center , sgr a * , provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore stellar evolution , the population of compact objects , and the interstellar medium of the galactic center . ultimately , these elements contribute to our understanding of the possibility for the use of pulsars in short - period orbits to characterize the space - time metric of the black hole .",
    "in addition , the proximity of the pulsar to sgr a * provides a unique reference source to characterize the high angular resolution properties of sgr a * that are obscured by the effects of interstellar scattering @xcite .",
    "psr j1745 - 2900  was discovered serendipitously on 24 april 2013 ( mjd@xmath3 ) through detection of a strong x - ray burst as part of a daily monitoring campaign carried out by the _ swift _",

    "the measured period derivative implies a characteristic age of @xmath9 kyr and a magnetic field @xmath10 g , under standard assumptions for magnetic dipole breaking .",
    "the transient nature of the x - ray flux and the low spin - down power relative to the x - ray luminosity indicate that psr j1745 - 2900  is not a rotation - powered pulsar but a magnetar .",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated a factor of @xmath7 increase in the spin - down rate of the magnetar with hard x - ray observations .",
    "the variability of the spin - down rate demonstrates that the characteristic age is accurate to at most an order of magnitude .",
    "association of soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) with supernova remnants suggests that magnetar ages are @xmath11 ",

    "psr j1745 - 2900  was found to have the largest dispersion measure , @xmath13 , and rotation measure , @xmath14 , of any known pulsar .",

    "pulsar timing show that the pulse width scales as @xmath15 and that pulses can be detected to frequencies below 2 ghz @xcite .",
    "three other pulsars in the central 40 pc of the galaxy show temporal broadening that is comparable to that of psr j1745 - 2900 i.e. , @xmath16 sec at 1 ghz @xcite . using the model of a geometrically thin scattering screen in combination with angular and temporal broadening , @xcite",

    "the absence of pulsar discovery has raised the issue of whether there is a problem of missing pulsars in the galactic center .",
    "this has led to discussion of alternative pulsar populations in the galactic center .",
    "@xcite argue that the detection of a rare radio magnetar and the demonstration of the ability to detect ordinary pulsars implies that the pulsar population of the galactic center may be distinct from the field population .",

    "an incorrect model of sgr a * will lead to different positional offsets between epochs if the @xmath223 coverage differs ( which it does , due to different failed antennas ) , as the calibration changes the data in order to match the incorrect model . in this sense the first 4 epochs are not especially poor , nor should this type of error lead to a right ascension error which apparently varies linearly with time .",
    "it would affect the 8 ghz observations more severely than 15 ghz due to the more severe effects of scattering , and a higher proportion of the first four epochs are at 8 ghz , so this could simply be random errors giving the appearance of linear motion in the first four epochs .",

    "the angular offset from our target field to nrao 530 is 16 deg , and so it is likely that the phased vla gain is slightly lower and more time variable in these epochs .",
    "since the vla heavily affects the calibration solution , being the most sensitive antenna , errors in its gain calibration could propagate through to larger errors in the other telescopes gain calibrations and hence positional offsets .",
    "there is a direct link to the first 4 epochs , however , there is once again no reason to expect an apparently linear motion with time .",
    "third , ionospheric effects can introduce wavelength dependent astrometric errors . in the case of our experiment , the small separation , @xmath224 , between calibrator and target leads to a correspondingly small error in relative positions .",

    "thus , ionospheric effects do not affect our result .",
    "fourth , the apparent structure of sgr a * itself could change with time . since we use a constant model at each frequency ( derived from the concatenated datasets at that frequency )",
    "there is no way to detect or account for such a change , which could be due to intrinsic source effects ( such as a time - variable core shift due to material propagating outwards along a jet ) or time - variable scattering or scintillation . by forcing sgr a * back to the model position during calibration",
    ", we would impose an equivalent shift on the target magnetar . unlike the previous two explanations , evolution of sgr",
    "a * could lead to a linear position change with time , and it would likely be along the right ascension axis , which is both the major axis for the scattering and for the intrinsic structure of sgr a*. however , the effect we see seems too large for this to be a likely explanation .",
    "various estimates of the scatter - broadened size of sgr a * @xcite show it to be constant over time within the error bars , and the intrinsic size of sgr a * is likely much smaller than the required shifts here .",
    "the specific case of a time - variable core shift is considered in more detail in section  [ sec : sgra ] .",
    "fifth , refractive wander could induce variations in the position of the size on an angular scale smaller than the size of the scattered image .",
    "the motion of @xmath16 mas in right ascension is much less than the image size of @xmath228 mas .",
    "the short timescale of the fluctuation @xmath229 days , however , appears inconsistent with the refractive timescale @xmath230 days at 3.4 cm , where @xmath231 kpc is the earth to scattering screen distance , @xmath232 is the scatter - broadened angular size , and @xmath233 is the relative velocity of the screen perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "@xmath234 is a minimum timescale for significant refractive changes because the turbulent medium may be uniform on scales larger than @xmath235 in the scattering screen .",
    "as noted above , the apparent size of sgr a * has remained constant over the course of @xmath236 yr , suggesting that the refractive timescale is likely quite large .",

    "further , previous attempts to detect positional wander in sgr a * relative to background quasars at a separation of 0.5 deg have not shown any effect on scales larger than 400 @xmath239as on time scales ranging from @xmath16 hour to 1 month @xcite .",
    "longer timescales were probed by observations of water masers in sgr b2 , which has a similar degree of scatter broadening to sgr a * @xcite .",
    "no positional wander was detected on a timescale of 6 months to a limit of 18 @xmath239as rms for maser spots spread over a region 4  in scale .",
    "on the other hand , the astrometric offsets we see are only a fraction of the total potential refractive image wander , and thus could potentially occur on ( proportionately ) shorter timescales than @xmath234 .",
    "in particular , the recent discovery of substructure in the image of sgr a * at 1.3 cm wavelength @xcite suggests that refractive effects could impact the determiation of the centroid of psr j1745 - 2900  and the correct model for sgr a*. point - like emission with a flux density @xmath240 of the total flux density was found , effectively demonstrating that sgr a * resides in the `` average '' image regime @xcite .",
    "the characteristic time scale for the average image regime ranges from the diffractive timescale @xmath16 sec to the time for an interferometric resolution element to move by a single beam @xmath24 yr , i.e. , comparable to the refractive timescale .",
    "the amplitude of refractive image wander relative to the scattered size in the case of a shallow turbulent spectrum ( @xmath241 ) will scale as the ratio of the substructure to peak flux densities . that ratio is @xmath242 at 1.3 cm in the results from @xcite , a factor of 10 smaller than the actual imaging errors at 3.4 and 2.0 cm .",
    "steeper turbulent spectra can lead to more widely varying refractive image wander .",
    "we also do not know whether refractive image wander would be independent between sgr a * and psr j1745 - 2900 if the image wander is common between the two sources then there would be no astrometric effect in our data . for a single epoch of our data at ku band",
    ", we did fit a gaussian scattering model plus point source and found no significant change in the resultant position for psr j1745 - 2900 .",
    "more detailed study of the wavelength characteristics and time variability of this substructure can determine whether refractive image wander is a significant limitation for astrometry of psr j1745 - 2900 .",
    "finally , the change in proper motion in right ascension could be due to real acceleration of the magnetar , during a close encounter with a massive star ( a wide companion in a highly elliptical orbit , or a chance encounter ) .",
    "to produce the apparent change in proper motion between the first four and the last four epochs would require acceleration @xmath243 , equivalent to the effect of a massive star at a distance @xmath244 pc , or 25 mas .",
    "no star is known to be this close to psr j1745 - 2900 ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "we also consider this implausible , since the radial acceleration from such an encounter would also affect the pulsar timing , and no large deviations from the long - term timing trends are seen around mjd 56500 . in particular , for an edge - on orbit we require a change in the period derivative of @xmath245 , an order of magnitude larger than the period derivative @xmath246 measured by @xcite at this epoch .",
    "in fact , timing observations detected an abrupt change in the period derivative at mjd=56450 , in the middle of the apparently linear proper motion and , therefore , in conflict with orbital motion .",
    "if we take the conservative estimate of the measured period derivative as entirely due to acceleration , we set an upper limit that the inclination angle must be @xmath247 . a more detailed analysis of the timing data will set even stronger constraints .",
    "thus , the encounter would have to had been seen almost face on , an unlikely but not impossible scenario .",
    "ultimately , we can not confirm or rule out any of the explanations listed above with the exception of differential ionospheric errors .",
    "additional astrometric epochs may eventually provide enough information to favour one of these explanations , but the additional uncertainty imposed on the right ascension proper motion due to the scatter in the first four epochs does not alter any of the conclusions which follow in this paper . removing this systematic uncertainty and approaching the s / n limited uncertainty in proper motion , however , will be crucial in detecting the acceleration of psr j1745 - 2900  due to sgr a * over a long period ( see section  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .    due to the relatively poor quality of the right ascension least - squares fit , for the proper motion only case , we also performed a bootstrap resampling method to estimate solutions and errors more accurately .",
    "the bootstrap method resampled the data with replacement @xmath248 times .",
    "we did not group the data by date , which may permit some small amount of correlated error to propagate into our solutions , i.e. , as the result of same - day tropospheric corrections . in practice",
    ", we found negligible difference in the solutions ( i.e. , @xmath249 ) if we averaged the data by date before including it in the bootstrap algorithm .",
    "we adopt the bootstrap result , which is consistent with the least - squares fit but with larger errors , as our best result .",
    "we consider initially the astrometric fits to proper motion alone .",

    "the best - fit proper motion is the opposite sign and within 25% of the magnitude of the proper motion of sgr a * relative to the icrf ( caused by galactic rotation ) .",
    "this produces the result that the pulsar is nearly at rest relative to the icrf .",
    "nevertheless , it is the motion of the pulsar relative to sgr a * , which is relevant for understanding its origin and future .",

    "this resolution requires that we are at an early stage of high - mass star formation following a period of relative inactivity comparable to the characteristic pulsar lifetime ( @xmath24 myr ) in which few pulsars were formed . in this scenario ,",
    "the young pulsar population of the galactic center resembles that of a star - forming cluster similar to wd 1 , which has no radio pulsars . as the cluster ages",
    ", lower mass stars will go through a supernova phase and produce ordinary pulsars ( i.e. , non - magnetars ) .",
    "the star formation history of the galactic center cluster over the age of the galaxy has been extensively studied ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". evolved giant branch stars appear to reveal a significant rise in the star formation rate over the past few hundred million years , reaching the current peak of @xmath336 yr@xmath337 .",
    "the star formation rate 100 myr in the past is an order of magnitude lower than the current rate .",
    "the granularity of star - formation rate determination with this method is fairly coarse , however , with characteristic widths of approximately @xmath338 myr . on the other hand , study of high mass stars",
    "indicates a burst of star formation no earlier than 6 myr in the past @xcite , i.e. , indicating variability in the star formation rate on time scales comparable to the pulsar lifetime .",
    "magnetar formation is poorly understood and based on a relatively small sample of objects .",
    "for instance , evidence has been presented that some ordinary pulsars may evolve into magnetars @xcite .",
    "considering also the complex star - formation history of the galactic center , we can not present a definitive account of the origin of psr j1745 - 2900  and pulsars in the vicinity of sgr a*. nevertheless , the anomaly of the first galactic center pulsar appearing as a magnetar and the apparently insufficient strength of the scattering screen to obscure ordinary pulsars is plausibly resolved through a scenario in which magnetars are the earliest pulsars formed in the young galactic center cluster .",
    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) from previous generations of star formation , on the other hand , should be present and would still have escaped detection in existing surveys . even with the reduced temporal broadening estimate based on a greater distance to the scattering screen , detection of msps requires high frequency , high sensitivity observations .",
    "msps , therefore , provide the potential for the characterization of general relativistic effects associated with sgr a*. efforts are underway to search for msps at frequencies above 10 ghz with the vla , gbt , and effelsberg @xcite ; an ska - sized array built with high frequency receivers or alma @xcite may have the capability to detect msps if current efforts are unsuccesful .",

    "<S> we measure the proper motion of the pulsar psr j1745 - 2900  relative to the galactic center massive black hole , sgr a * , using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsar has a transverse velocity of @xmath0 at position angle @xmath1 deg east of north at a projected separation of 0.097 pc from sgr a*. given the unknown radial velocity , this transverse velocity measurement does not conclusively prove that the pulsar is bound to sgr a * ; however , the probability of chance alignment is very small . </S>",
    "<S> we do show that the velocity and position is consistent with a bound orbit originating in the clockwise disk of massive stars orbiting sgr a * and a natal velocity kick of @xmath2 . an origin among the isotropic stellar cluster is possible but less probable . </S>",
    "<S> if the pulsar remains radio - bright , multi - year astrometry of psr j1745 - 2900  can detect its acceleration and determine the full three - dimensional orbit . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that psr j1745 - 2900  exhibits the same angular broadening as sgr a * over a wavelength range of 3.6 cm to 0.7 cm , further confirming that the two sources share the same interstellar scattering properties . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we place the first limits on the presence of a wavelength - dependent shift in the position of sgr a * , i.e. , the core shift , one of the expected properties of optically - thick jet emission . our results for psr j1745 - 2900  support the hypothesis that galactic center pulsars will originate from the stellar disk and deepens the mystery regarding the small number of detected galactic center pulsars . </S>"
