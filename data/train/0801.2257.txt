    "it is now widely accepted that stars form in dense and gravitationally bound molecular cloud ( mc ) cores .",
    "thus , understanding the properties of the core mass function ( cmf ) is the cornerstone of any successful theory of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the question whether there is a 1-to-1 mapping between the cmf and the imf remains an open one .",
    "the cmf is usually represented by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 takes different values in different mass ranges ( for the imf , @xmath2 for @xmath3 m@xmath4 , salpeter 1955 ) .",
    "the determination of the cmf of cores of several mc regions have been obtained using a variety of wavelengths and techniques such as mm spectroscopy of various molecular lines , submm / mm continuum emission from dust , and stellar near infrared absorption by dust .",
    "usually , no prior assumptions are made on the type of structures identified in these studies .",
    "they can be a mixture of prestellar cores , unbound objects , and eventually protostellar envelopes . for nearby mcs , where it is possible to identify dense cores ( with average number densities @xmath5 @xmath6 ; hereafter cores ) , the cmf is usually described by a two component power law above and below a turnover point ( with exponents @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively ) . starting with the 1.2 mm study of the ophiuchus starless dense cores by motte et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , a number of submm / mm dust continuum observations have found @xmath7 and @xmath8 to be in the range [ -2.1,-3 ] and [ -1.3,-1.5 ] , respectively ( motte et 2001 ; testi & sargent 2001 ; johnstone et al .",

    "2006 ; enoch et al .",
    "these estimates bracket the values of the exponents of the imf ( scalo 1998 ; kroupa 2002 ; chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "similar slopes are found using high density molecular tracers such as h@xmath9co@xmath10 ( onishi et al .",
    "2002 ; ikeda et al . 2007 ) and the near infrared absorption technique ( alves et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand , submm / mm observations of more distant clouds in which it is only possible to identify lower density structures ( @xmath11 @xmath6 ; hereafter clumps ) , exhibit values of @xmath7 in the range of [ -1.4,-1.8 ] if the whole cmf is fitted with a single power law ( coppin et al .",

    "values of @xmath13 $ ] resemble the slopes of the stellar clusters mass function ( elmegreen 2000 ) , which hints to the fact that these objects can not be the direct progenitors of individual stars and must undergo additional fragmentation .",
    "the discrepancy in @xmath7 between the cores and clumps populations does not seem to be merely an effect of the spatial resolution and hence of mass resolution .",
    "additional evidence might be that , in motte et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the inclusion of the larger size cores in the cmf changes the values of @xmath7 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "an explanation of the origin of the discrepancy would be that different physical processes dominate the evolution of these two populations of cores .",
    "the close resemblance between the cores cmf and the imf suggests that they are more likely to be gravitationally bound ( which is confirmed by mm line observations , andr et al .",
    "2007 ) and are the direct progenitors of stars or small stellar systems , whereas clumps are more likely to be dominated by turbulence .",
    "note that the description of the cmf by power law functions is not the unique option .",
    "reid el al .",
    "( 2006 ) argued that a lognormal function is a better fit to the observed cmf in many regions and goodwin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that the cmf of the submm cores obtained by nutter & ward - thompson ( 2007 ) is well represented by a lognormal distribution ( also fig . 2 in andr et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "several physical processes are believed to play a role in shaping the cmf : gravitational and thermal fragmentation ( larson 1985 ; klessen 2001 ; li et al .",
    "2003 ) , supersonic turbulence ( padoan & nordlund 2002 , pn02 ) , accretion ( larson 1992 ; bonnell et al . 2001 ; bate & bonnell 2005 ) , core coalescence ( murray & lin 1996 ; dib et al .",
    "2007a,2008 ) , feedback ( adams & fatuzzo 1996 ) , and magnetic fields ( shu et al .",
    "a number of numerical studies of mcs that include some of these physical processes have derived a cmf that bears some resemblance with the cmf of cores and the imf ( gammie et al .",

    "the origin of the differences between the cores and clumps cmfs and the eventual link between them has not been investigated so far . in this study , we identify cores in a high resolution 3d numerical simulation of a magnetized , turbulent , and self - gravitating mc model at different density thresholds . in dib",
    "et al . ( 2007b ) , we have shown , using a detailed virial analysis that the inner parts of dense structures , identified at higher density thresholds , are more gravitationally bound than the same objects identified at lower thresholds .",
    "thus , constructing the cmf at different thresholds is a direct test of the effects of gravity on the cmf .",
    "a striking example of how the density threshold can modify the inferred masses of cores is the case of the core l1512 .",
    "its derived mass from co observations is @xmath16 m@xmath4 ( falgarone et al . 2001 ) , whereas it was estimated from submm observations at @xmath17 m@xmath4 ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "for the whole cmf , kramer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) derived a value of @xmath18 for the orion b - s region from @xmath9co(1 - 0 ) observations whereas johnstone et al .",
    "( 2006 ) derived a value of @xmath19 from submm observations .",
    "another example is the case of the ngc 7538 region , observed by kramer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to have a cmf slope of @xmath20 in the @xmath9co(1 - 0 ) line and @xmath21 in the c@xmath22o(1 - 0 ) line which traces higher density material .",
    "we performed a 3d numerical simulation of a magnetized , self - gravitating , and turbulent isothermal mc using the tvd code ( kim et al .",
    "the simulation is similar to the ones presented in dib et al .",
    "( 2007b ) but with a higher numerical resolution of @xmath23 grid cells .",
    "in dib et al .",
    "( 2007b ) , we found that the population of cores formed in a moderately magnetically supercritical mc reproduces best some of the available observations such as the virial parameter - mass relation .",
    "thus , we here only consider this cloud model for further analysis .",
    "the features of this simulation are : turbulence is driven until it is fully developed ( for 2 crossing timescales ) before gravity is turned on .",
    "the poisson equation is solved to account for the self - gravity of the gas using a standard fourier algorithm .",
    "turbulence is constantly driven in the simulation box following the algorithm of stone et al .",

    "cores are identified using a clump - finding algorithm that is based on a density threshold criterion and a friend - of - friend approach as described in dib et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "we restrict our selection of cores to epochs where the truelove criterion ( truelove et al . 1997 ) is not violated in any of them .",
    "thus , our derived cmf applies to starless prestellar cores . at a given threshold ,",
    "the number of cores detected at one epoch is insufficient to sample appropriately the whole mass spectrum .",
    "it is therefore necessary to combine cores selected at several epochs in order to construct a cmf that is statistically significant .",
    "we combine the populations of cores identified at 35 timesteps .",
    "this approach resembles the situation in the observations where cores identified in different locations of a mc are most likely in different stages of their evolution . even for a composite multi - epoch spectrum ,",
    "the statistics of cores identified with thresholds @xmath37 remains poor .",
    "before discussing the cmf obtained from the simulation , it is worth checking what cmf is anticipated from the turbulent fragmentation formalism of pn02 .",
    "note that this formalism does not explain the cmf of clumps . in the pn02 approach , @xmath7",
    "is given by @xmath38 - 1 $ ] , where @xmath39 is the exponent of the turbulent velocity field power spectrum ( @xmath40 ) . in order to reproduce the cmf of clumps ,",
    "the formalism of pn02 requires @xmath39 to be close to zero , which is not observed .",
    "[ fig1 ] displays the time evolution of @xmath39 in our simulation , and a few velocity spectra at selected epochs .",
    "the value of @xmath39 is observed to fluctuate around @xmath41 . according to pn02",
    ", this would result in a value of @xmath42 ( at a given epoch and for a multi - epoch built cmf ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left ) displays the cmf for cores identified at the density thresholds of 20 and @xmath43 .",
    "both samples use the same number of timesteps .",
    "several features of the cmfs can be noted .",
    "if the high - mass end of the spectra is to be assimilated to a power law , fits to the cmf in this regime yield a steeper slope for the high density threshold sample than for the one with the lower threshold .",
    "the slopes for the @xmath44 and @xmath43 cmfs are @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the mass ranges [ 1,113 ] m@xmath4 and [ 2.8,44 ] m@xmath4 respectively .",
    "however , the cmfs are also well fitted over their entire mass range by a lognormal distribution whose width is smaller at higher threshold .",
    "the width of the lognormal fit of the cmf is @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the @xmath49 and @xmath43 levels , respectively ( the width of the imf is @xmath50 , chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test indicates that the @xmath44 and @xmath43 cmfs have a probability of only 2 percent of being drawn from the same parent distribution , a result significant at the 2.3 sigma level . for reference",
    ", we also calculated the cmf slope of @xmath44 cores in a non self - gravitating model ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , right ) .",
    "the slope of the cmf in the high mass range is larger for the non self - gravitating cloud model than for the self - gravitating one ( @xmath51 and resembles the one predicted and obtained by hennebelle & audit ( 2007 ) for turbulence dominated , non self - gravitating clumps ( in this non self - gravitating case , statistics are not enough to build the @xmath43 cmf ) .",
    "the slopes of the cmf at high mass end are shallower than those predicted by pn02 and steepen with increasing threshold .",
    "we interpret the shallower than the imf slopes and the steepening with increasing threshold to the role played by gravity in modifying the cmf generated by turbulence .",
    "the steepening of the slope with increasing threshold is due to the increasing importance of gravity at higher thresholds .",
    "[ fig3 ] displays the ratio of the gravitational term in the virial theorem ( @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the gravitational potential ) to the other terms that appear in the virial equation .",
    "the latter terms are condensed in the quantity @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are the volume thermal , kinetic , and magnetic energies , respectively , with @xmath58 being the thermal pressure , and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are the thermal , kinetic , and magnetic surface energies , respectively , where @xmath62 is the maxwell stress tensor .",
    "[ fig3 ] indicates that gravity is , on average , more important in the virial balance for the cores defined at the @xmath43 threshold which are a mixed population of gravitationally bound and unbound objects than for the @xmath44 cores which are essentially unbound objects .",
    "an extrapolation to higher thresholds of the order of 500 @xmath63 @xmath6 which are number densities similar to those of gravitationally bound cores observed in the submm / mm or in dense molecular tracers would yield slopes in the range [ -2.3,-2.5 ] , thus offering a natural explanation for the similarity of the observed slopes between the cmf of dense cores and of the imf . the reason why the cmf of the @xmath44 cores in the self - gravitating regime is shallower than that of the same population in the non self - gravitating case is most likely due to the long range effects of gravity .",
    "[ fig4 ] displays the time evolution , for the @xmath44 cores , of the fraction of the mass present in the cores , number of cores , and average and median masses of the cores .",
    "the increasing mass fraction and average mass of the cores at roughly equal number of cores even before any of them proceeds to collapse are a clear indication of mass growth affecting the cores due to the combined effect of gas accretion and core coalescence ( see fig . 16 in dib",
    "on the other hand , the constancy of the number of cores and their median mass means that newborn cores are generated with the smallest masses .",
    "although it is not possible to assess from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the contribution of each of these two processes , this mass growth which constitutes a deviation from the purely turbulent regime is responsible for the flattening in the @xmath44 cmf in the self - gravitating case as compared to the non self - gravitating one .",
    "in this work , we have constructed the mass function of cores in a 3d numerical simulation of a magnetized , turbulent , and self - gravitating molecular cloud .",
    "cores are identified at the density threshold levels of @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xmath6 . in agreement with observations ,",
    "the slope of the core mass function is found to be steeper for cores identified at the higher threshold level .",
    "the steepening of the slope with increasing threshold is due to the increasing importance of gravity in the virial balance of the cores at higher densities and a sign of the role played by gravity in the gravo - turbulent scenario of star formation . on the other hand , at lower thresholds ,",
    "the slope is shallower than what is found for the purely turbulent case .",
    "this is due to the effects of mass growth that affect the cores .",
    "this mass growth is essentially due in the initial phase to the effect of core coalescence which generates more massive structures particularly for cores defined at lower thresholds since they have larger cross sections .",
