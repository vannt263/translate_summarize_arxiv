    "among the great science and technology challenges of this century is the development of the experimental capability to detect cosmic background neutrinos . to this end , we study the neutrino background as it is expected today , based on the freeze - out condition in the dense early universe , combined with subsequent free - streaming and red - shifting to temperatures below the neutrino mass . in consideration of these results we argue that the present day massive relic neutrino background could form a quantum fermi liquid state .",
    "we present arguments that the correlations inherent in a neutrino quantum fermi liquid could be exploited in novel detection methods that utilize resonant amplification of relic neutrino drag forces .",
    "this approach is in contrast to prior attempts to find a directly observable signature of the relic neutrinos , which have focused on the magnitude of the mechanical force due to scattering from a massless neutrino background  @xcite .",
    "the consensus reached in the literature is that , for an unstructured ( relativistic ) neutrino gas , such effects are far from the abilities of current detector technology . aside from elastic scattering there are also inelastic processes  we note the development of the ptolemy experiment  @xcite aiming to observe relic electron neutrino capture by tritium , as originally proposed by weinberg  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will first characterize the free streaming distribution from the perspective of an observer in relative motion under the usual boltzmann dilute gas assumption , utilizing the physically consistent equation of state from @xcite .",
    "we will then argue that high degree of degeneracy of the non - equilibrium relic neutrino distribution , together with their temperature @xmath1 , implies the inadequacy of the dilute gas assumption , resulting in a correlated background .",
    "this leads us to explore the possibility of the detection of relic neutrinos by resonant amplification of the neutrino - detector interaction .    in our characterization of the cosmic neutrino background ( cnb )",

    ", we treated the freeze - out temperature @xmath4 as a free parameter and obtained the dependence of the free streaming neutrino distribution on @xmath4 in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find that the @xmath4 dependence can be expressed in terms of the measured value @xmath2 and vice verse .",
    "this was done under the assumption of a strictly sm - particle inventory and allowed for a determination of the effect of neutrino mass @xmath11 , and @xmath12 on the equations of state determining the universe expansion .",

    "upper bounds have been placed on the electron neutrino mass in direct laboratory measurements @xmath19ev  @xcite .    in the subsequent analysis",
    "we will focus on the neutrino mass range @xmath20ev to @xmath21ev in order to show that direct measurement sensitivity allows for the exploration of a wide mass range .    in section [ sec :",
    "dist_background ] we introduce the free - streaming massive neutrino distribution .",
    "we present our characterization of the neutrino distribution , including the dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath14 , in section [ sec : dist ] . in section [ sec : q_fluid ] we show that at present day temperatures and densities , the cnb will have properties of a quantum fermi fluid , including density correlations . with this , we discuss the possibility of detection via resonance with the neutrino dynamical correlation frequency , which we estimate in the earth frame to be within the range 110 - 160 mhz .",
    "the neutrino background and the cmb were in equilibrium until decoupling ( called freeze - out ) at @xmath22 . in the cosmological setting , for @xmath23 the decoupled neutrino spectrum evolves according to the fermi - dirac - einstein - vlasov ( fdev ) free - streaming distribution  @xcite , @xmath24 @xmath25 is the fugacity factor , here describing the underpopulation of neutrino phase space that was frozen into the neutrino fdev distribution in the process of decoupling from the @xmath26-qed background plasma .",
    "the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath4 is given in ref.@xcite .",

    "after decoupling , each particle travels through the universe on a geodesic , free of interactions other than gravity .",
    "the effects of gravity are simply the usual red - shifting of momentum .",
    "this implies that the distribution must be a function of @xmath35 only ( @xmath36 being the redshift temperature scaling ) and so , given the initial condition at @xmath34 , the necessary form is eq.([neutrino_dist_rest ] ) .    in practice",

    "this gives the distribution the same form as that of a massless fermion .",
    "in other words , the fact that freeze - out occurred at @xmath38 means that the free - streaming distribution carries little information about the mass .",

    "an important consequence of the structure of weak interactions is that @xmath38 , meaning that freeze - out occurs prior to large scale annihilation of neutrinos .",

    "this has important implications for the quantum nature of the cnb .",

    "the neutrino background and the cmb were in equilibrium , mediated by @xmath5 plasma , until decoupling .",
    "therefore one surmises that an observer would have the same relative velocity , @xmath39 , relative to the relic cnb as with the cmb .",
    "measurements of the cmb dipole anisotropy yield a relative solar system cmb velocity of @xmath40km / s @xcite . taking into account the relative orientation of the earth orbital plane and the dipole direction ( but neglecting ellipticity of the orbit ) , the relative velocity is modulated in the range @xmath41km / s @xcite . in the following",
    "we will write velocities in units of @xmath42 , though our specific results will be presented in km / s .    by casting the neutrino distribution , eq.([neutrino_dist_rest ] ) , in a relativistically invariant form",

    "see  @xcite and  @xcite for further discussion of the effects of the neutrino distribution anisotropy in the earth frame .    using eq.([neutrino_dist ] ) , the normalized fdev velocity distribution for an observer in relative motion is obtained has the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the neutrino degeneracy and @xmath48 is the number density in the current frame . @xmath49 was obtained by marginalizing over the angular variables , hence the integration over @xmath50 .",

    "the prospects for detecting an unstructured relic neutrino background due to neutrino scattering from a detector has been studied by many authors , both the @xmath77 effects debated in @xcite and the @xmath78 force in @xcite , and were eventually found to be well beyond the reach of current detection efforts .",
    "considering the recent establishment of neutrino mass well above the scale of temperature of the neutrino background , a new physics opportunity arises which has not been considered in the earlier efforts . while treating the scattering as a quantum process , all earlier studies modeled the cnb distribution as an unstructured particle gas . as a consequence of this assumption ,",
    "each neutrino impact on a detector is independent of the others .",
    "this means that irrespective of the spectrum structure we presented in the previous section , the impact to impact correlation of events in a neutrino detector is a white shot noise spectrum .",
    "hence only the overall strength of the interaction is relevant for neutrino detection .",
    "however , once one accepts that @xmath79 , i.e. that neutrinos become ` cold ' in the free - streaming process while the universe expands and cools , one sees that the cnb neutrinos must form a dense quantum fluid .",
    "while we are first to note this in context of neutrino detection , quantum cnb properties have already been recognized in a different context  @xcite .",
    "the expected degeneracy is further enhanced by gravitational accretion .",
    "this has been studied previously for a classical particle gas of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the former found density enhancement by a factor of @xmath80 for neutrino masses on the scale of @xmath81ev . to quantify the importance of gravitational accretion on the neutrino quantum fluid structure we show in figure  [ fig : nu_dist_enhanced ] the neutrino distribution as a function of momentum normalized by temperature and corresponding to a density enhancement factor of 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 ( bottom to top ) .",
    "we see in figure  [ fig : nu_dist_enhanced ] that the quantum degeneracy increases rapidly and if indeed neutrinos accrete in the expected way , we are today immersed in a nearly degenerate quantum liquid .",
    "we return to this point further below .",
    "( bottom to top).,height=211 ]    a precise model of the background neutrino density correlations would require modeling their formation as the universe cools while it expands and , equally importantly , incorporating the effects of solar system gravitational enhancement in the local quantum fluid distribution as discussed above .",
    "these steps are beyond the scope of this initial proposal . however , the presence of correlations in a quantum fluid is a well understood feature within the context of condensed matter physics  @xcite , and we will base our arguments on this analogy  we believe that the pivotal outcome of this circumstance can be captured by considering neutrino impacts on the detector to be strongly correlated , leading to a structured impact spectrum that can be leveraged for resonant detection .",
    "we will investigate this now within a simple model .",
    "the importance of quantum effects is recognized in figure  [ fig : debroglie_num ] where we show the neutrino de broglie wavelength distribution ( dashed line ) and cumulative distribution ( solid line ) , both computed in the cnb rest frame for @xmath56 .",
    "the fact that we study now the neutrino liquid in the rest frame of the relic neutrinos where the distribution is a function of momentum only , see eq.([neutrino_dist ] ) , makes the result independent of neutrino mass .",
    "the vertical line shows the value of @xmath82 where the @xmath83 , a measure of the average separation between neutrinos . in computing @xmath48 ,",
    "the degeneracy must be taken to be equal to one .",
    "there is no spin degeneracy as neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) are left ( right ) handed , meaning in this context that there is one neutrino state of each flavor .",
    "( this is not the place to resolve the well known problem that handedness and helicity are not one and the same thing once neutrinos have a mass . )",
    "we consider the density of only a single neutrino flavor at a time and without the corresponding antiparticle , so that we can ascertain the degree to which exclusion principle considerations make this a quantum system .",
    "the conversion of one flavor into another ( neutrino oscillation ) does not affect this constraint as for the present we assume that in equilibrium as many neutrinos oscillate out into another flavor as they oscillate in .",
    "the cumulative distribution in figure  [ fig : debroglie_num ] shows that approximately @xmath84 of the neutrinos have debroglie wavelength longer than @xmath85 , indicating the importance of quantum effects in the homogeneous universe , without any gravitational accretion .",
    "this result is independent of @xmath54 for @xmath86 , as the redshifting of momentum and temperature compensate one another . in other words , the high density nature of the neutrino background in the early universe , in terms of particles per debroglie volume , is preserved in the subsequent free - streaming evolution because freeze - out occurs at @xmath38 .",
    "this important insight would be lost if one were to use ( incorrectly ) a thermal equilibrium neutrino distribution , since massive thermal neutrinos with @xmath87 are very dilute .",

    ", height=230 ]    we now return to consider the effect of density enhancement via gravitational accretion of neutrinos discussed above",
    ". density increase ( while maintaining the effective temperature ) leads to a significant increase in degeneracy , and hence to strengthening of the quantum nature of the relic neutrino fluid .",
    "we illustrate this in a quantitative fashion in figure  [ fig : debroglie_num2 ] , where we show the fraction of neutrinos whose debroglie wavelength is longer than the characteristic separation length @xmath88 , as a function of the density enhancement factor due to accretion . as already noted , on the left we see that about half of neutrinos are degenerate in a homogenous universe and this fraction rises to 85% for a factor of 10 neutrino density enhancement in the galaxy .",
    ", as a function of the density enhancement factor compared to homogenous universe density.,height=260 ]",
    "we turn now to evaluate the experimental opportunity provided by the newly recognized quantum correlations between neutrino impacts . a detailed evaluation of the neutrino shot noise spectrum is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , much can be learned from a simple model .",
    "first , we observe that neutrino oscillation measurements imply that at least one neutrino species has sufficiently high mass for the corresponding component of the cnb to be very cold , @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "the quantum nature of a cold massive fermion liquid will induce correlations in the cnb , even in the absence of interactions , due to pauli - fermi exchange effect repulsion  @xcite .",
    "such correlations will cause the temporal spectrum of neutrinos scattering from a detector to deviate from white noise .",
    "we emphasize that we are not assuming that the potential ( i.e. the detector ) from which the neutrinos scatter is noisy , rather the noise is provided by the stochastic process consisting of neutrino impacts on the detector . for our discussion to be meaningful it is necessary that the detector is cooled to sufficiently low temperature so that the thermal noise in the detector does not wash out the signal from correlated neutrino impacts .",
    "we make a crude estimate of the impact correlation by assuming a perfect cubic lattice with side length @xmath89 . in this case",
    "the neutrino impacts are not random and the characteristic frequency for such a lattice is @xmath90 which , as a function of @xmath53 and with @xmath55km / s , is given by the following fit @xmath91 the annual earth orbital velocity and daily rotation velocity produce a shifted frequency response as a function of @xmath92 in the approximate range @xmath93km / s , and is an important signature that distinguishes a neutrino signal from other noise sources .",
    "this modulation , together with @xmath94 , gives @xmath95mhz@xmath96 mhz .",
    "gravitational accretion of neutrinos in the solar system would increase the frequency further , scaling with the cube root of the particle density .",
    "moreover , the increased quantum nature of the neutrino liquid further justifies the simple model we have used .    the central value estimate in eq.([shotnoise ] )",
    "assumes that all neutrinos contribute to the correlation effect .",
    "however , if only half of neutrinos participate in the correlated neutrino dynamics , as suggested by figure [ fig : debroglie_num ] , then the central frequency would be reduced by a factor of @xmath97{2}$ ] . for @xmath98 and @xmath55km",
    "/ s this corresponds to @xmath99 mhz . on the other hand figure [ fig : debroglie_num2 ] provides in quantitative fashion an opportunity to evaluate how the fraction varies with neutrino density enhancement .",
    "thus measurement of resonance frequency comprises information about the neutrino quantum liquid .",
    "the key point in our consideration is that such a structured neutrino background noise raises the possibility of detection of the relic neutrinos via resonant amplification of the momentum transfer from neutrino scattering .",
    "we note that the peak at @xmath100@xmath101mhz for @xmath98 and @xmath55km / s is in a domain where one could argue an accidental noise signature could have already been observed .",
    "this noise would arise from neutrino elastic scattering resonating with electromagnetic mechanical resonators .",
    "given that there is a strong cosmic background in this frequency range , see e.g. ref.@xcite , an exploration of the background noise signature has probably not been undertaken .",
    "we thus believe that in the interesting frequency range the variation of in - detector observed noise as a function of terrestrial observer velocity vector with respect to the cmb is at present unexplored .    to better understand the noise spectrum , including the very important resonance peak width , a significantly more precise model of the cnb correlations is needed .",
    "we do not attempt to undertake this here .",
    "however , we believe that the distinct frequency of the impact corelation can vastly enhance the mechanical force when the effect is integrated over sufficiently long period of time and the detector has minimal damping .",
    "* remarks about dark matter : * while very different in detail , a challenge similar to cnb detection exists with the effort at direct detection of dark matter .",
    "provided that some physical property of dark matter correlates the temporal mechanical impacts , the here proposed resonant mechanical force detection method also applies to dark matter detection .    considering a dark matter particle mass @xmath102 , with lower limit of a few mev  @xcite , and the dark matter content in the universe ( 20% of all gravitating energy )",
    ", one can estimate dark particle density . assuming that a sizable fraction of dark matter impacts is correlated we find the impact frequency , @xmath103 , is reduced to below mhz , and is decreasing as a function of mass , @xmath104 . the dark matter and neutrino signatures",
    "are thus well seperated in frequency and both merit further experimental study by the here proposed novel resonant method .    *",
    "conclusions : * in this work we have characterized the relic cosmic neutrino spectra in terms of their velocity , energy , and de broglie wavelength distributions in a frame of reference moving relative to the neutrino background , with all examples focused on an earth bound observer .",
    "we have shown explicitly the mass , @xmath14 , dependence and the dependence on neutrino reheating expressed by @xmath2 , choosing a range within the experimental constraints .",
    "the dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath14 shown as a ratio on linear scale in figure [ fig : debroglie_300 ] ( bottom frame ) is sufficiently strong to suggest that if and when relic neutrino detection becomes possible both @xmath2 and @xmath14 would be directly measurable .",
    "the effect of @xmath2 as presented here is to increase neutrino flux  @xcite , see eq.([nnu ] ) .",
    "however , to this end one must gain precise control over the enhancement of neutrino galactic relic density due to gravitational effects  @xcite as well as the annual modulation  @xcite .    as we argued in section",
    "[ sec : q_fluid ] , the relic background of massive neutrinos will not behave as a purely free streaming gas , but have properties of a quantum liquid .",
    "this inevitably leads to impact correlations which will cause the power spectrum due to neutrinos scattering off a detector to deviate from white noise , as we discuss in section [ sec : q_fluid_detect ] .",
    "the spectrum should exhibit a peak near a frequency arising from the relative velocity of the terrestrial observer with respect to cnb .",
    "based on a simple model we find an expected range of 111 ",
    "140mhz for the central value , with the frequency increasing based on gravitational accretion enhanced neutrino density .",
    "the frequency is subject to modulation by the temporal variation of the observer velocity vector with respect to cnb .",
