    "the term _ spin vortex _ has become common in theoretical and experimental studies of magnetic materials .",
    "it is , in fact , a particular case of a more general class of physical / mathematical objects called _ topological defects _  @xcite .",
    "although , strictly speaking , topological defects can be defined only in terms of a continuous field , similar formations can be observed in lattice spin models .",
    "moreover , it is the spin vortices that are responsible for the _ berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition _ in the @xmath0 @xmath1 model  @xcite ( or , speaking more generally , in classical @xmath0 easy - plane magnets ) .",
    "most of the theoretical studies of the vortex properties are limited to the low - temperature continuum model proposed by kosterlitz and thouless @xcite ( kt model , hereafter ) . however",
    ", this approach obviously can not give satisfactory results , when essentially `` discrete '' phenomena , as the effects induced by a spinless site , are studied .",
    "the lack of theoretical studies regarding spin vortices on a lattice and the related problem of spin vortex ",
    "spin vacancy interaction is the principal motivation for the present work .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath1 model is usually defined as a system of two - component spins @xmath2 of unit length which states can be represented by a polar coordinate @xmath3 : @xmath4 , placed at sites @xmath5 of a square lattice , and described by the hamiltonian @xmath6\\ .\\ ] ] close enough to the ground state we have @xmath7 or @xmath8 for neighboring sites @xmath9 ,  @xmath10 .    generally ,",
    "considering two neighboring spins at sites @xmath5 and @xmath10 , one can encounter the two situations : @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( the situation @xmath13 can be neglected ) . in order to define spin vortices in the system under consideration ,",
    "let us introduce the lattice of sites @xmath14 , dual to the original lattice ( the dual lattice is the set of all the centers of elementary cells of the original lattice ) , and consider only those bonds @xmath15 which intersect the bonds @xmath16 of the original lattice for which @xmath17 .    in order to consider the bonds of interest in a systematic way , let us say that @xmath18 , @xmath19 define the bond @xmath16 if @xmath20 for a horizontal bond and @xmath21 for a vertical bond , where @xmath22 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the same rule is imposed for bonds of the dual lattice .",
    "now , we can ascribe to every bond @xmath15 a direction defined by the sign of @xmath23 of the intersected bond @xmath16 : @xmath24 if @xmath25 for a horizontal bond @xmath15 or @xmath26 for a vertical bond @xmath15 , and @xmath27 in the opposite case .",
    "the introduced representation is unique for a given microstate of the spin system ( the revers statement is not true , of course ) .",
    "the most basic structural unit that can be distinguished in the representation we have built is a path @xmath28 ( either straight or steps - like ) connecting two sites of the dual lattice , formed by one or several bonds connected together so that their directions comply with some general direction of the path . in the most general case , that path can be either closed or not closed .",
    "while a closed path @xmath28 represents a trivial situation , the spin configuration with @xmath28 starting and ending at different sites of the dual lattice is of great interest and is called a vortex - antivortex pair ( it can be said that the vortex and the antivortex are centered at the ends of the path @xmath28 ) .",
    "the above concerns vortices with topological charges @xmath29 ; pairs of vortices with higher values of topological charge can be defined in terms of several paths that start at the vortex and end at the antivortex .",
    "paths that start at the same site but end at different sites correspond to clusters of vortices with different absolute values of charge ( for example , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the regions around the vortex origins are characterized by significant disorientation of spins and are called `` cores '' .",
    "moderate spin - wave excitations , when @xmath32 everywhere except for the vortex `` cores '' , can not destroy the vortex - antivortex pair unless the two defects annihilate at the same point .",
    "short - range exchange forces between spins lead to long - range effective interaction between vortices .",
    "the energy of this interaction can be explicitly singled out in the hamiltonian of the villain model , and turns out to depend only on the essentially inherent characteristic of the vortices called _ topological charge _",
    "it will be shown that the logarithmic asymptotic form , obtained by villain for the attraction energy of the vortex and the antivortex at large separations , in fact holds sufficiently well on a lattice up to the smallest possible separation of one lattice spacing @xmath22 ( if neglecting the subtle anisotropy effects ) .",
    "on the contrary , the corresponding energy which we estimate for the @xmath0 @xmath1 model turns out to deviate from the logarithmic law at small separations .",
    "in particular , our result for the energy needed to create a vortex - antivortex pair is approximately @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the coupling constant ) , in contrast to @xmath35 of the villain model @xcite , and in reasonable agreement with the recent results of monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "the details of the results announced above can be found in section [ ii ] .",
    "an aspect of the spin vortex behavior , which only recently drew attention of the researchers , is the effective interaction with nonmagnetic inclusions in the lattice  @xcite .",
    "such spin vacancies are part of the models with quenched disorder  @xcite and the lattice gas spin models  @xcite . here , we will focus , however , not on the thermodynamic quantities , but on the effective hamiltonian which describes the interaction between spin vortices and vacancies .    to our knowledge , the first theoretical works devoted to this problem demonstrated global deformation of the vortex structure caused by a single vacancy and repulsive interaction between the vortex origin and the vacancy  @xcite .",
    "this result was essentially caused by an application of the kt continuum model which required representation of the vacancy by a cutout of a finite size in the continuous spin field .",
    "subsequently , the same authors denied this nonphysical result , on the basis of their spin dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "the problem was resolved phenomenologically , postulating that the vacancy does not change the vortex structure ( or the change is negligible )  @xcite . under this assumption ,",
    "the kt theory led to the attractive interaction which agreed with the results of computer simulations .",
    "however , this approach , giving correct qualitative picture , was not able to describe the particular details of the lattice under consideration .    in our study , based on the villain model",
    ", we obtain the effective hamiltonian describing interaction between spin vortices and spin vacancies on a square lattice .",
    "for example , as it will be shown in this paper , the interaction energy for an individual vortex of topological charge @xmath36 at point @xmath14 and a spin vacancy at @xmath5 reads : @xmath37 i.e. the vacancy and the vortex attract each other .",
    "( [ e - intro ] ) is the asymptotic expression which in fact holds well enough for separations as small as just a few lattice spacings .",
    "it will be argued that in the @xmath0 @xmath1 model this energy differs considerably from ( [ e - intro ] ) for small separations @xmath38 .",
    "for example , the vortex - on - vacancy pinning energy of the villain model @xmath39 , in contrast to that of the @xmath0 @xmath1 model observed in spin dynamics simulations , @xmath40 @xcite , and other numerical studies , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the details of the results announced here can be found in section [ iii ] .",
    "studying the low - temperature properties of the model ( [ h_xy_0 ] ) it would be natural to apply the spin - wave ( harmonic ) approximation ( swa ) , i.e. to replace @xmath42 in ( [ h_xy_0 ] ) with @xmath43 . indeed , this allows to examine many important properties of the low - temperature phase of this model  @xcite . however , the states with @xmath44 , which are crucial when considering spin vortices , will have non - physical energy in this case .",
    "so , the proper harmonic approximation must be @xmath45 with @xmath46 at low temperatures , @xmath47 can be considered as independent degrees of freedom taking discrete values @xmath48 . in turn , this leads to the hamiltonian of the villain model : @xmath49 ( obviously , @xmath50 ) .    assuming that @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are chosen so that @xmath54 for any pair of spins in the system , i.e one can say that the field @xmath52 is vortexless , and all the vortices are `` contained '' in @xmath55 , the hamiltonian ( [ h_vill ] ) can be written as : @xmath56\\\\\\label{h_vill_1 } & & + \\ j \\sum_{\\bf r}\\varphi_{\\bf r}\\sum_{\\bf u}\\left(\\psi_{\\bf r } - \\psi_{\\bf r+u } - 2\\pi m_{\\bf r , r+u}\\right)\\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 and lattice spacing @xmath22 .    following villain @xcite",

    "the short notation @xmath68 will be helpful .",
    "due to the properties : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , it is enough to define @xmath73 and @xmath74 only for @xmath75 being positive nonzero integers ( natural numbers ) , thus they can be presented as infinite matrices . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
