    "the system under study consists of a sharply resonant whispering - gallery mode cavity made of dielectric material , pumped with a continuous - wave laser ( see fig . [",
    "fig : schema ] ) .",
    "the coupled resonator can be characterized by its quality factor @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the spectral linewidth of the ( loaded ) resonance at the angular frequency @xmath3 of the resonance .",
    "typical values for @xmath0-factors leading to the generation of kerr combs are in the range of @xmath4 . in wgm resonators , the eigenmodes of the fundamental family",
    "are quasi - equidistant , and these modes can be excited by the pump excitation above a certain threshold .",
    "kerr comb generation in high-@xmath0 whispering - gallery mode resonators can be described by two kinds of models .",
    "the first kind describes the evolution of each resonant mode in the cavity , producing a system of @xmath5 ordinary differential equations , with @xmath5 being the number of modes to be taken into consideration  @xcite . while this modal model allows for the easy determination of comb generation threshold , its computational cost makes it inappropriate for studying the evolution towards chaos of the system .",
    "furthermore , only a finite , arbitrary number of modes can be simulated with this model which reduces the accuracy of the numerical results , especially for chaotic systems where a very large number of modes is excited .",
    "while the modal description consisted in large set of ordinary differential equations , the spatiotemporal formalism provides an unique partial differential equation ruling the dynamics of the full intracavity fieldrefs .  @xcite . from the numerical point of view",
    ", this latter description allows for easy and fast simulations using the split - step fourier algorithm , thus allowing the construction of bifurcation diagrams in order to study the mechanisms that lead to chaos in a highly resonant and nonlinear optical cavity .    in its normalized form ,",
    "the lle describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the intracavity field @xmath6 explicitly reads  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a dimensionless time ( @xmath9 being the photon lifetime ) and @xmath10 is the azimuthal angle along the circumference of the disk - resonator .",
    "the real - valued and dimensionless parameters of the equation are the laser frequency detuning @xmath11 , the second - order dispersion @xmath12 , and the laser pump field @xmath13 .",
    "the link between these dimensionless parameters and the physical features of the real system are explicitly discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "chaos preferably arises in the system in the regime of anomalous dispersion , which corresponds to @xmath14 ( see refs .",
    "it is also important to note that the two parameters of the system that can be controlled experimentally are related to the pump signal . in particular , the laser pump power is proportional to @xmath15 , and will be the scanned parameter of our bifurcation diagrams .",
    "intuitively , it can be understood that the more energy is coupled inside the cavity , the more frequencies will be created through the kerr - induced four - wave mixing , ultimately leading to chaotic behavior .",
    "the other parameter accessible to the experiments is the detuning frequency @xmath11 between the pump laser and the resonance .",
    "it is expressed in terms of modal linewidths , in the sense that @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath3 are the laser and resonance angular frequencies , respectively .    at the experimental level ,",
    "the most easily accessible characteristic of the system is its optical spectrum . effectively ,",
    "while the lle model rules the dynamics of the spatiotemporal variable @xmath6 , the spectrum can be obtained by performing the fourier transform of the optical field in the cavity .",

    ", the number of rolls in the cavity is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : numberofrolls ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : stabmap ] gives the values of @xmath51 above threshold .",
    "however , after further increase of the excitation , the number of rolls in the cavity may not correspond to this ideal number , and the pattern changes abruptly when the number of rolls has to shift .",
    "this phenomenon is responsible for the discontinuities observed on the bifurcation diagrams .    for very high excitation ,",
    "the turing patterns become unstable , starting with oscillations in the amplitude of the rolls peaks .",
    "these fluctuations become stronger as @xmath15 is increased , finally leading to a chaotic behavior with peaks of diverse amplitudes .",
    "in the case @xmath21 , the initial condition is chosen such that the system converges to an unique soliton located at @xmath52 . at this point ,",
    "the bifurcation diagram shows three extrema corresponding to the soliton maximum , the continuous background and the dips on each side of the soliton ( pedestals ) .    since the soliton is a sub - critical structure  @xcite linked to a @xmath38 bifurcation  @xcite , it is still present for @xmath15 just below the bifurcation value , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : soliton ] .",
    "when the excitation is increased , the soliton maintains its qualitative shape , with the continuous background being increased while the dips remains approximately at the same level .",
    "when the @xmath39 bifurcation is reached , the previously stable continuous background becomes unstable , and the soliton can no longer be unique : a train of identical pulses whose shapes are similar to the initial soliton appear in the cavity .",
    "these pulses fill entirely the cavity , in a similar fashion to what was observed in the @xmath20 case .    for relatively small detunings ,",
    "the subsequent evolution of the bifurcation diagram is similar to the @xmath20 case , with fluctuations of the pulses amplitudes ultimately leading to a chaotic repartition of the energy in the cavity . for greater detunings ( @xmath37 in fig  [",
    "fig : soliton ] ) , the @xmath39 bifurcation happens at very high excitations , and the soliton remains alone in the cavity for a large range of pump power @xmath15 .",
    "this soliton becomes unstable in the process , and transforms into a soliton breather whose peak amplitude oscillates periodically with time .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations increases with @xmath15 until the system explodes to chaos in the vicinity of the @xmath39 bifurcation .",
    "in the experimental setup , a continuous - wave laser beam is amplified and coupled to a wgm resonator using a bi - conical tapered fiber , as portrayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] .",
    "the output signal is collected at the other end of the same fiber and monitored either in the spectral domain with a high - resolution spectrum analyzer , or in the temporal domain with a fast oscilloscope .",
    "it should be noted that this output signal is the sum of both the continuous pump signal and the optical field inside the cavity : the measured spectra will only differ from the intra cavity spectra through an increased contribution from the pump laser .",
    "the wgm resonator is made of magnesium fluoride ( mgf@xmath53 ) with refraction index @xmath54 at @xmath55  nm .",
    "this dielectric bulk material has been chosen for two reasons .",
    "first , this crystal is characterized by very low absorption losses , allowing for ultra - high @xmath0-factors , equal to @xmath56 ( intrinsic ) in our case .",
    "secondly , the second - order dispersion of mgf@xmath53 is anomalous at the pumping telecom wavelength ( @xmath57 nm ) , so that the waveguide dispersion is not strong enough to change the regime dispersion ; the overall dispersion generally remains anomalous regardless of the coupling .",
    "the diameter of the wgm resonator is @xmath58  mm and its free - spectral range ( fsr  also referred to as _ intermodal frequency _ )",
    "is @xmath59  ghz , where @xmath60 is the velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "once an efficient coupling is achieved , the pump power is increased to few hundreds of milliwatts , and the detuning is adjusted so that kerr frequency combs are generated .",
    "further adjustments of these two parameters allow us to reach chaotic regimes where every mode of the fundamental family in the wgm resonator is populated . in the example of figs .",
    "[ fig : expvsnumspectra](a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) , the pump power was fixed and the detuning was changed from a negative value to a positive value by increasing the wavelength .",
    "the bump in the background noise level is due to the unfiltered amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) originating from the optical amplifier used in the experiment .",
    "the comb ( a ) corresponds to a destabilized turing pattern where the so - called primary and secondary combs  @xcite have evolved by populating nearby modes until every mode is filled . on the contrary , the structure of spectrum ( e ) is smooth , and originates from the destabilization of cavity solitons .",
    "the comb presented in ( c ) stands in the transition between the two different regimes . in each case",
    "however , important fluctuations of the amplitude of each mode are observed , confirming the chaotic nature of these experimental kerr combs . to obtain representative spectra , the ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) spectra were averaged over 30 consecutive measurements .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : expvsnumspectra ] , we also provide numerical simulations of the optical spectra that qualitatively correspond to their experimental counterparts .",
    "the dispersion parameter was determined using eq .",
    "( [ eq : numberofrolls ] ) and an experimental spectra with turing patterns near threshold , yielding @xmath43 .    similarly to the experiments ,",
    "the simulated combs were obtained for a fixed pump power @xmath42 and three different detunings .",
    "the first one , @xmath61 correspond to the turing pattern case while the last one @xmath46 is in the soliton regime .",
    "the transition case was taken for @xmath45 , close to the @xmath19 limit .",
    "as stated previously , the power of the central mode has been increased with @xmath62  dbm to account for the differences between the intra - cavity and output spectra . to simulate the integration of the spectrum analyzer , the spectra",
    "are averaged over the last @xmath63  iterations .",
    "the agreement between numerical simulations and experiments is excellent : it covers an impressive dynamical range of @xmath64  db , and a spectral range of @xmath65  thz which corresponds to more than @xmath41 modes .",
    "this agreement also validates the interpretation of these combs as the result of two different routes to spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the generation of optical kerr combs in wgm resonators using the lugiato - lefever equation to describe our experimental system .",
    "numerical simulations allowed us to draw bifurcation diagrams of the system for various frequency detuning values .",
    "the natural scanning parameter in this case is the pump power injected in the resonator .",
    "depending on the value of the detuning parameter , various routes to chaos have been evidenced .",
    "in particular , for detunings @xmath11 below @xmath22 , the chaotic kerr combs originate from destabilized turing patterns . in this case",
    ", the envelope of the corresponding kerr comb displays several maxima which are reminiscent of the primary and secondary combs encountered at lower excitation . for @xmath11 higher than @xmath22 , the evolution of a soliton can either lead to a set of unstable pulses filling the cavity or optical breathers before reaching chaos .",
    "the optical spectrum in this case is smooth , with a shape similar to the soliton s spectrum . in both cases ,",
    "the numerical spectra are in excellent agreement with the experimental results obtained using a ultra - high @xmath0 magnesium fluoride resonator , thereby providing a strong validation of the model and simulations .",
