    "<S> we study the electronic structure and the magnetic correlations of cyanocobalamin ( c@xmath0h@xmath1con@xmath2o@xmath2p ) by using the framework of the multi - orbital single - impurity haldane - anderson model of a transition metal impurity in a semiconductor host . here , we first determine the parameters of the anderson hamiltonian by performing density functional theory ( dft ) calculations </S>",
    "<S> . then , we use the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) technique to obtain the electronic structure and the magnetic correlation functions for this effective model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that new electronic states , which correspond to impurity bound states , form above the lowest unoccupied level of the host semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> these new states derive from the atomic orbitals at the cobalt site and the rest of the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that magnetic moments develop at the co(@xmath3 ) orbitals and over the surrounding sites . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that antiferromagnetic correlations exist between the co@xmath4 orbitals and the surrounding atoms . </S>",
    "<S> these antiferromagnetic correlations depend on the filling of the impurity bound states . </S>"
