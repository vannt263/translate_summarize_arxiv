    "capel ( bc ) model @xcite is a spin1 ising model with single ",
    "ion anisotropy that has been introduced as a model for magnetic systems and then applied to multicomponent fluids @xcite and extended to the blume  emery  griffiths model @xcite for he@xmath0he@xmath1 mixtures .",
    "it is not exactly solvable in more than one dimension , but it is has been studied over infinite @xmath2dimensional lattices by means of many different approximate techniques , and its phase diagram is well known .    in recent years ,",
    "when the theory of surface critical phenomena started developing , some attention has been devoted to the study of the bc model over semi ",
    "infinite lattices , with modified surface couplings . in particular benyoussef , boccara and saber @xcite have determined the phase diagram in the mean field approximation , reporting four possible topologies at fixed bulk / surface coupling ratios , while benyoussef , boccara and el bouziani @xcite have done a similar analysis using a real space renormalization group transformation .",
    "other works , referring to particular regions of the phase space , are those by peliti and leibler @xcite and crisanti and peliti @xcite ( real space renormalization group ) , jiang and giri @xcite ( mean field approximation ) , tamura @xcite ( effective field approximation ) and the present authors @xcite ( cvm , low temperature expansion ) .",
    "all these results show that , as in the case of the spin1/2 ising model @xcite , it is possible to have a phase with ordered surface and disordered bulk , which is separated from the completely ordered phase by the so  called _ extraordinary _ transition and from the completely disordered phase by the _ surface _ transition .",
    "when such a phase is absent , the transition between the completely ordered and the completely disordered phase is named _ ordinary _ and the meeting point of the lines of these three kinds of phase transitions is said _ special _ , and is generally a multicritical point . while it is well established that the ordinary transition can be either first or second order , the possibility of a first order surface or extraordinary transition has been ruled out by benyoussef , boccara and el bouziani @xcite and tamura @xcite , but not by the other authors .    in the present paper , which can be regarded as a refinement of a previous work @xcite",
    ", we apply the pair approximation of the cluster variation method ( cvm ) @xcite to the blume  capel model defined on a semi  infinite simple cubic lattice with a ( 100 ) free surface . the dependence of the local quantities ( order parameters , energy density , and so on ) on the distance from the free surface is taken into account by dividing the lattice into an infinite set of layers parallel to the surface and then treating the @xmath3th layer ( we will use @xmath4 ) as if it was bulk .",
    "our results confirm the existence of first order extraordinary and surface transitions ( for the surface one we obtain very good agreement with a previous low temperature expansion analysis ) .",
    "moreover , we show clearly that another first order transition can occur at the surface in presence of an ordered bulk , which separates two phases with large and small values of the surface order parameters , the latter being a new phase .",
    "when this new transition is included in the phase diagram , the classification given by benyoussef , boccara and saber @xcite is completed with the addition of two new topologies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define the model and determine its ground state ; in section iii we give the pair cvm free energy functional and describe the nested iteration procedure we use to find its minimum ; in section iv we describe our results , giving the complete classification of the phase diagram topologies and the behaviour of the order parameters and their profiles in the new phase . finally , in section",
    "v , we briefly summarize and discuss our results .",
    "the bc model on a semi ",
    "infinite lattice @xmath5 with a free surface denoted by @xmath6 is defined by the ( reduced ) hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 are site labels , @xmath9 is the @xmath10component of a spin1 operator at site @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the bulk and surface nearest neighbors ( reduced ) interactions ( assumed positive ) , respectively , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the bulk and surface single ion ( reduced ) anisotropy and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 boltzmann s constant and @xmath18 absolute temperature ( from now on , we will express the temperature in units of the bulk interaction , by setting @xmath19 ) .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the coupling ratios @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "as it is often the case with classical discrete models , we can easily determine the ground state of our model by looking for the lowest energy configurations .",
    "this analysis is very important since it drives all subsequent considerations .    for the bulk ,",
    "as is well known , we have a state with broken spin ",
    "flip symmetry for @xmath22 , given by e.g. @xmath23 for all bulk spins , and a state with unbroken symmetry , @xmath24 , for @xmath25 .",
    "these two states are associated with ordered and disordered bulk phases , respectively , at finite temperature .    at the surface",
    "the situation is slightly more complex .",
    "let us define the states lo and ho by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding energies per site will be @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 in the bulk disordered phase and @xmath31 in the bulk ordered phase ( @xmath32 is but the bulk order parameter @xmath33 at zero temperature ) .",
    "we can now distinguish the following cases @xcite :    \\a ) when @xmath34 there is a surface transition at @xmath35 , in presence of an ordered bulk , and the states lo and ho are associated , at finite temperature , to two phases with ordered surface , but with different values of the surface order parameters : the phase ho ( we use the same symbols for the phases and the corresponding pure states at @xmath36 ) has large order parameters and is the usual ordered phase , while lo is a new phase with small order parameters ; this situation has not been considered before , except in the limit @xmath37 , which yields the spin1/2 ising model with a spin1 free surface studied by kaneyoshi @xcite , in which a first order surface transition in the presence of ordered bulk is obtained , but neither studied in detail nor reported in the phase diagram ;    \\b ) when @xmath38 there is a surface transition at @xmath39 , in correspondence of the bulk transition , and the states lo and ho are associated to phases with disordered and ordered surface , respectively ;    \\c ) when @xmath40 there is a surface transition at @xmath41 , in presence of a disordered bulk , and the states lo and ho have the same meaning as in the previous case .",
    "in order to study the finite temperature properties of the model , we introduce now the pair approximation of the cluster variation method .",
    "the cvm is based on an approximate expression of the entropy of the model as a sum of contributions by all the elements of a set @xmath42 consisting of certain maximal clusters and all their subclusters . in the pair approximation",
    ", one takes as maximal clusters all nearest neighbor pairs , and thus the only subclusters to be considered are the sites .",
    "to each cluster @xmath43 is associated a cluster ( reduced ) entropy given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a cluster density matrix , to be determined minimizing the free energy .",
    "the total reduced entropy is then approximated by @xmath46 where the coefficients @xmath47 obey @xcite @xmath48 and @xmath49 represents the multiplicity ( number of clusters per site ) of the cluster @xmath43 .",
    "since we have to deal with local quantities ( density matrix elements , in our formulation ) which depend on the distance from the surface , we divide our lattice , as mentioned in the introduction , into two dimensional layers parallel to the surface , labeled by an integer @xmath50 , @xmath51 being the surface layer . furthermore , to avoid working with an infinite number of variables",
    ", we will treat the @xmath3th layer ( typically we will choose @xmath52 ) as if it was bulk , by means of suitable constraints , and the bulk itself will be considered in the cvm pair approximation , too , using the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce the density matrices @xmath53 for the pairs having both sites in the @xmath50th layer , @xmath54 for those pairs having spin @xmath55 in layer @xmath50 and spin @xmath56 in layer @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for sites in layer @xmath50 .",
    "the pair density matrices must satisfy the obvious constraints @xmath59 which ensure that the site density matrices can be properly defined , e.g. by @xmath60 .",
    "\\label{rho1n}\\ ] ] finally , in order to make the @xmath3th layer represent the bulk in an effective way , we will treat the corresponding pair density matrix as a constant , defined by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the normalized bulk pair density matrix given by the cvm pair approximation @xcite .",
    "notice that the normalization of @xmath62 and the constraints eq .",

    "the method of solution can be described as follows :    0 .",
    ": :    initialize all pair density matrices with a rough estimate of the    solution ; 1 .",
    ": :    determine the site density matrices according to eq .",
    "[ rho1n ] ; 2 .",

    "[ nim ] with the values of    the lagrange multipliers obtained in step 3 ; 5 .",
    ": :    iterate steps 14 until the desired precision is reached .    recalling",
    "that , in region of the phase space close enough to first order transition lines , our free energy should have different minima corresponding to stable and metastable phases , one has to repeat the above procedure with different initializations , corresponding to the different phase , and then choose the solution of minimum free energy .",
    "once the solution is found one readily obtains the order parameters @xmath72 and , in an analogous way , all the correlation functions .",
    "by means of the nested iteration procedure described in the previous section , we have determined the phase diagram of our model in the plane @xmath73 , for fixed values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we have obtained six main topologies , reported in fig .",
    "1 , extending thereby the classification by benyoussef , boccara and saber @xcite , in which cases ( a ) and ( d ) were missing .",
    "these topologies are identified by specifying the ground state , according to the classification given in section ii , and the result in the ising limit @xmath76 .",
    "recalling the known results about the critical behaviour of the semi  infinite ising model @xcite one realizes that in this limit there are two possibilities : for @xmath77 the model exhibits an ordinary transition at the ising bulk critical temperature , while for @xmath78 it undergoes an extraordinary transition at the bulk critical temperature and a surface transition at a higher temperature .",
    "the best estimate for @xmath79 is about 0.66 @xcite . in fig .  1 ,",
    "case ( a ) corresponds to @xmath77 and @xmath34 , case ( b ) to @xmath80 and @xmath38 , case ( c ) to @xmath77 and @xmath40 , case ( d ) to @xmath78 and @xmath34 , case ( e ) to @xmath81 and @xmath38 and , finally , case ( f ) to @xmath78 and @xmath40 .",
    "notice that almost all of the above topologies , with the exception of cases ( b ) and ( f ) , could be further divided into subtopologies based on the order of surface and bulk transitions at the special point @xmath82 and on the eventual coalescence of that point with the critical point @xmath83 .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .",
    "2 , which refers to cases ( a ) and ( d ) of fig .  1 .",
    "it is also interesting to look at the behaviour of the order parameters in the cases ( a ) and ( d ) of fig .  1 , where the new lo phase appears . in figs .",
    "3a and 3b , which refer to case ( a ) , we see that the surface layer order parameters increase from zero at low temperatures ( it can be shown exactly that at low temperatures they behave as @xmath84 ) , while the order parameters of the inner layers behave nearly as the bulk ones . furthermore , in figs . 4a and 4b , the effect of the new surface phase transition is clearly shown .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the first order surface transition which occurs in presence of a disordered bulk , which existence , questioned by previous works @xcite , is clearly confirmed in our approximation ( fig .  1 , cases ( c ) and ( f ) ) . in fig",
    "5 we have compared , for one choice of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , our results with those obtained by mean field approximation @xcite and low temperature expansion @xcite .",
    "it is clearly seen that our approximation is a marked improvement with respect to the simple mean field approximation , and the very good agreement with the low temperature expansion results is a strong argument in favour of the existence of such a transition .    finally , we have not found any reentrant phenomenon in the phase diagram , contrarily to previous results @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy should be due to the very rough approximation used in @xcite , where only one layer above the bulk was considered and , a factor even more important , the method of solution adopted did not satisfy the first of the constraints eq .",
    "[ compat ] in the case @xmath85 ( = 2 , in that case ) .",
    "we have determined the phase diagram of the semi  infinite blume  capel model using the pair approximation of the cluster variation method .",
    "our analysis has shown , at fixed @xmath74 and @xmath75 , six main topologies , two of which are completely new because of the appearance of a new ordered phase and , consequently , of a new surface first order phase transition in presence of an ordered bulk .",
    "this new phase has been studied in some detail and typical behaviours of the order parameters profiles have been reported .",
    "we have also given an example of how these main topologies may be slightly modified by varying @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "a question concerning the existence of the surface first order transition in the presence of disordered bulk has been addressed and clarified by comparing our results with previous results obtained by a low temperature expansion and , finally , the issue of reentrant phenomena in the surface transitions , raised in a previous paper , has been shortly discussed .",
