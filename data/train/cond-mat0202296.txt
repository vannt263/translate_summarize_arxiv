    "avalanche phenomena are common in nature . examples range from accumulating snow on mountain slopes , slow shearing between continental plates  @xcite , rerouting in river networks , to creeping magnetic flux lines in super conductors  @xcite . following the work by bak _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , physicists aim to capture the essential aspects of such dynamical systems with simple automaton processes , commonly referred to as sandpile models and self - organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "impressive successes have been achieved , like reproducing power - law distributions in avalanche events similar to those observed in nature , and the start of a classification scheme of such processes in terms of so - called universality classes  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately most of these are numerical in nature .",
    "analytical exact results remain rare .    directed avalanche phenomena form a subclass of these soc processes .",
    "dhar and ramaswamy introduced the first directed sandpile model and solved it exactly  @xcite .",
    "this was possible because in their model the avalanche propagation is governed solely by its two edges , and those two follow independent random walk dynamics .",
    "tadi and dhar  @xcite introduced a directed model in which particles are allowed to pile up beyond the critical height , by replacing the automaton s deterministic toppling rule by a stochastic one  @xcite .",
    "the density of critical sites tunes itself and at distances far from the driving edge the propagation of active sites approaches the directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite threshold .",
    "the scaling properties of the avalanche distributions are thus linked to the critical exponents characterizing the dp universality class .",
    "another example of a stochastic directed avalanche process is the model introduced and studied numerically by pastor - satorras and vespignani  @xcite .",
    "similar as in the above model by dhar and ramaswamy , the stable landscape configurations ( between avalanche events ) lack internal correlations in the stationary state .",
    "this allowed paczuski and bassler  @xcite and also kloster _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to link this dynamic process to so - called edwards - wilkinson  @xcite ( ew ) interface growth and to derive the exact scaling exponents of the avalanche distributions .",
    "this novel world sheet type connection between avalanche dynamics and interface growth is particularly promising , because interface dynamic processes like ew and kardar - parisi - zhang  @xcite ( kpz ) growth are very well understood , in particular in 1 + 1 dimensions ( 1 + 1d ) where the scaling properties are known exactly .",
    "however , the above models that are linked to ew type growth are rather poor examples , because ew growth is described by a simple linear stochastic ( diffusion type ) langevin equation ; correlations factorize , and important caveats in the relation to avalanche dynamics can be obscured by this simplicity .",
    "we set out to generalize this approach to nonlinear interface dynamic processes , and recently introduced a directed unloading sandbox model  @xcite in which the two dimensional ( 2d ) avalanche dynamics relates to 1 + 1d kpz type interface growth .",
    "we derived exponent relations between the avalanche and interface growth scaling properties , which are generic , and valid beyond our specific model .",
    "our numerical results for the avalanche distributions ( for length , width , depth , and mass ) follow indeed these exponent relations .",
    "moreover , the avalanche critical exponents obey the predicted kpz values within a few percent , an accuracy typical to avalanche simulations . however , our numerical accuracy is better than that ; mostly because of a careful finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis .",
    "the exponents seem to converge to values that are slightly different from the kpz values .",
    "this left us with a puzzle .",
    "what is the origin of these small deviations ? is this a fundamental effect ; or do the exponents ultimately converge to the kpz values , but with unusually large corrections to scaling . in this paper",
    "we address these issues .",
    "we also provide a more detailed discussion of these world - sheet - type relationships between avalanche and interface growth dynamics .",
    "our first paper was short and did not include many of the details that are crucial for the analysis presented here .",
    "the fundamental difference between conventional kpz interface growth and avalanche dynamics arises from the averaging process over kpz type space - time world sheets . in normal monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of interface growth",
    "the distribution functions are determined in terms of ensemble averages over a set of totally uncorrelated space - time mc runs .",
    "in contrast , the avalanche dynamics gives rise to kpz world sheets that are strongly correlated .",
    "two subsequent mc runs are identical except inside a single avalanche area .",
    "this difference in averaging , uncorrelated versus avalanche correlated mc runs , therefore emerges as a key issue for understanding the scaling properties of avalanche dynamics .",
    "this issue did not arise in the earlier ew type avalanche models due to the linear nature of the ew process .",
    "however for nonlinear dynamics , like kpz , avalanche - correlated - type sampling could well lead to novel interface scaling exponents .    speaking against a shift in the values of the exponents , are arguments like : the kpz stationary state , i.e. , the sand surface profile far way from the driving edge ,",
    "can not be affected by the avalanche - correlated - type averaging , because large avalanches that span the entire width of the box occur periodically .",
    "these completely refresh the surface far way from the driving edge regularly , and thus wipe out all correlations between mc runs .",
    "this suggests that we are only dealing with much larger than usual corrections to scaling .",
    "the details are more complex than this simple argument , but we will establish that indeed the exponent values do not change .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the unloading sandbox model . in sec .",
    "[ moti ] we comment on how directed avalanche dynamics can be linked to interface growth in one lower dimension .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ kpz ] , we show that in the interface growth interpretation our specific model belongs to the kpz universality class . in sec .",

    "[ corrmc ] we present numerical results detailing how the traces left on the surface profile by previous avalanches influence both the avalanche exponents and the interface growth ones . these scars in the rough surface",
    "enhance the surface roughness .",
    "we cast this enhanced interface roughness in terms of corrections to scaling , and determine what value the critical dimension of the corresponding irrelevant operator @xmath0 ( in the sense of renormalization theory ) should have .",
    "next , we identify the geometric meaning of @xmath0 , starting with a study of the one dimensional ( 1d ) version of our model where a similar phenomenon takes place , sec .",
    "[ 1dedge ] . in 1d",
    "the interface growth process is a simple random walk , and the avalanche correlated sampling relates to the scaling properties of merging random walkers .",
    "@xmath0 represents the distribution of avalanche endpoints in the 1d surface , and can be studied directly from the rounding of the surface profile near the driving edge . in sec .",
    "[ 2dedge ] we return to the full 2d case .",
    "the scars of previous avalanches form lines on the surface .",
    "we identify @xmath0 with the angle these lines make with respect to the direction perpendicular to the driving edge , and confirm with an analytic argument that the critical dimension of @xmath0 is equal to @xmath1 with @xmath2 the kpz dynamic exponent .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "imagine a box filled with granular material , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sandbox ] .",
    "one of its four retaining walls is slowly lowered , such that the sand spills out from that side , and thus slowly unloads the box and establishes a sloped surface . in the quasistatic limit",
    ", the wall moves slow enough that the unloading events can be described as distinct avalanches .",
    "the box can be three dimensional , leading to 2d avalanche dynamics on a 2d surface , or can be 2d ( like in a very narrow box ) giving rise to 1d avalanches on a 1d surface .    inspired by this we consider a so - called solid - on - solid model defined on a 2d lattice .",
    "height variables @xmath3 are defined on a square lattice .",
    "we will consider two versions of the model . in the continuous height version ,",
    "the heights are real numbers . in the discrete model ,",
    "the heights are integers , @xmath4 .",
    "the former corresponds to a continuous material without internal structure , but strong cohesion up to a specific length scale @xmath5 , while the latter corresponds to layered material where the surface height is quantized .",
    "the 2d lattice is rotated diagonally such that the propagation direction of the avalanche is along the diagonal direction denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "this is the direction in which the avalanche will run . throughout this paper",
    "the coordinate perpendicular to @xmath6 will be denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ 2d sandbox lattice ] illustrates this geometry .",
    "the configurations are subject to the following stability condition .",
    "the column of particles on site @xmath8 is supported by the two columns , @xmath9 and @xmath10 directly below it and is stable when its height is less than the minimum of the heights at these two supporting sites increased by a fixed amount @xmath11 + s_{c}.\\ ] ] @xmath12 is a constant . in the version of our model where the heights are continuous variables @xmath12 represents the only length scale in the @xmath13 direction and can be set equal to 1 without loss of generality . throughout this paper",
    "we will also set @xmath14 in the discrete @xmath13 model .",
    "consider a stable configuration , after @xmath15 avalanches .",
    "the @xmath16-th avalanche is triggered at the highest site @xmath17 , on the @xmath18 driving boundary ( or , in the discrete height model , by randomly choosing one of the highest sites ) and reducing its height by a random amount @xmath19 .",
    "this likely creates unstable sites in the next @xmath20 row .",
    "those are updated by replacing their height by an amount equal to the lowest of the two supporting columns in the previous row and then adding an uncorrelated random amount @xmath21 with uniform distribution , as @xmath22 + \\eta ( { \\bf r}).\\ ] ] this updating continues row by row until all the sites are stable again . only after that the next avalanche is started .",
    "the toppling of a site only effects the stability of the two sites immediately above it in the next @xmath6-row .",
    "therefore we can update the system row - by - row in increasing order of @xmath6 .",
    "direct experimental realizations of this unloading sandbox model are not our immediate concern ( the focus is on establishing a generic theoretical relationship between avalanche dynamics and interface growth ) , but we expect that this model is applicable to actual experimental unloading sandboxes .",
    "one of the most important issues in this context is the row - by - row nature of the toppling rule .",
    "this is a crucial feature for our purposes , allowing the identification with kpz interface growth ( in the next section ) . in real unloading sandboxes the sand removed from row",
    "@xmath6 rolls down hill and likely disturbs the already stabilized lower surface levels .",
    "experimental realizations can avoid this from happening , e.g. , by choosing very light grains ( compared to the cohesion forces ) .",
    "note that our dynamic rule does not allow the build - up of any pockets ( deeper than @xmath5 ) on the surface that might trap such downward rolling grains .",
    "conservation laws are crucial to avalanche dynamics . unlike most avalanche processes ,",
    "our model does not conserve mass while the avalanche propagates .",
    "that might raise the specter of our model not being ( self - organized ) critical .",
    "the connection to kpz growth ( an intrinsic critical process ) dispels this phantom .",
    "moreover , the global slope of the surface is preserved during each avalanche run , and conservation of steps in the profile plays the role analogous to conservation of mass .",
    "the analysis of the dynamics involves distribution functions of various characteristic features of the avalanches , the common examples are : length , width , depth , and mass .",
    "the avalanche length @xmath23 will be defined throughout this paper as the maximum distance @xmath24 the avalanche travels from the driving edge ; the width @xmath25 as the maximum departure of the @xmath7-coordinate ( perpendicular to the propagation direction ) from the trigger point @xmath7-coordinate ; the depth @xmath26 as the maximum height change the avalanche creates at any of the affected sites ; and the mass @xmath27 as the total amount of material removed by the avalanche.[definition of l w d m ]",
    "the focus of this paper is on how the above avalanche dynamics relates to interface growth in one lower dimension .",
    "each stable sloped surface configuration of a directed sandpile can be reinterpreted as a world sheet ( space - time configuration ) of an interface in one lower spatial dimension .",
    "the direction in which the avalanches propagate plays the role of time and the perpendicular coordinates the role of space .",
    "our 2d unloading sandbox is equivalent to a 1d growing interface .",
    "such an interpretation makes sense only when the stability condition and the avalanche dynamic rule is directional and local in space - time , such that causality is not violated in the interface growth interpretation .",
    "the stability condition  ( [ stability ] ) and toppling rule  ( [ toppling rule ] ) of our model are row - by - row in nature and therefore indeed markovian in this sense .",
    "every stable configuration of the sandpile represents a possible interface growth life line ( space - time - evolution interface world sheet ) .",
    "the conventional procedure for determining the scaling properties of growing interfaces is to average over a large set of completely independent mc runs .",
    "this would mean , in sandbox language , an ensemble average over completely refreshed surfaces , each totally uncorrelated from the previous one ( except typically for the initial condition in row @xmath18 ) .",
    "the toppling rule  ( [ toppling rule ] ) is applied to all sites in every row , and repeated row - by - row , instead of only the unstable sites created by toppling only the highest site in the initial row .    in avalanche dynamics , however , two subsequent growing interface life lines in this ensemble differ only inside the avalanche area . from the interface growth perspective",
    "this represents a rather peculiar and dangerous correlated type mc run averaging procedure .",
    "the mc runs of kpz space - time configuration are strongly correlated , and this raises the specter of a change in the interface roughness scaling properties .",
    "the numerical evidence , presented below is sufficiently ambiguous that this issue will preoccupy us in the second half of this paper .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that the interface growth model conjugate to the unloading 2d sandbox belongs to the 1 + 1d kpz universality class .",
    "the time evolution of the interface is governed by the the toppling rule of the sand model with @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ toppling rule ] ) representing time @xmath28 , @xmath29 + \\eta ( x , t).\\ ] ] in the conventional global type interface evolution ( i.e. , totally refreshing non - avalanche - type uncorrelated mc runs ) every site in row @xmath30 is updated according to this rule .",
    "figure  [ interface dynamics ] illustrates the interface dynamics for one time step , @xmath31 .",
    "conceptually the time step can be split into two parts ; the deterministic @xmath32 $ ] operator part and the stochastic random deposition @xmath33 part .",
    "note that because of the diagonal orientation of the square lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ 2d sandbox lattice ] ) , the lattice sites are not `` stationary in time '' .",
    "the conceptually easiest interpretation to resolve this flip - flopping is to first double the number of lattice sites and then to require them to be paired alternately with their right or left neighbors at even and odd times ; at even times sites @xmath34 and @xmath35 are fused to be at equal heights and at odd times the @xmath36 and @xmath34 sites .",
    "the upper panel shows the deterministic first half of the update ( from the drawn to the dash line ) . the partners switch and",
    "the @xmath32 $ ] operation equalizes their heights by choosing the lowest of the two .",
    "so this step always removes material .",
    "this can be interpreted also in terms of a movement of the steps in the interface .",
    "all up - steps move to the right and all down - steps to the left ; while up and down steps merge when they meet at one site .",
    "the lower panel illustrates the second half of the update .",
    "the height of each fused pair increases by a random amount @xmath37 .",
    "deposition - type interface dynamics like this typically belongs to the kpz universality class  @xcite .",
    "indeed , eq .

    "there is no hidden special symmetry of some kind that makes it vanish by accident . at @xmath41",
    ", the kpz equation would reduce to ew growth .    to confirm the kpz nature and make sure that the @xmath40 is large enough that corrections to scaling from the ew point ( @xmath41 ) are not obscuring the kpz scaling , we perform mc simulations on the interface dynamics as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ interface dynamics ] .",
    "the mc runs are completely independent .",
    "we measure the time evolution of the interface width @xmath42 defined as @xmath43 with over bars ( angle brackets ) indicating average over @xmath7 ( ensemble ) . starting from ,",
    "e.g. , a flat initial condition it should scale as @xmath44 at intermediate times @xmath45 , and saturate at @xmath46 for @xmath47 ; with @xmath48 the length of the 1d interface .",
    "the exponents for the kpz universality class in 1 + 1d are known exactly with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ interface scaling exponents ] .",
    "the values of @xmath52 are obtained from the saturated interface widths by imposing the scaling form  ( [ alpha definition ] ) at adjacent values of the system size @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , the values of @xmath53 are obtained from the transient interface widths by imposing the scaling form  ( [ beta definition ] ) at nearby times @xmath54 .",
    "we like to remind the reader that simple log - log plots of @xmath42 versus @xmath48 and @xmath54 look typically impressively straight but are notoriously inaccurate .",
    "the construction of effective exponents , in the above manner might at first glance look less impressive ( the data appears noisier ) , but this brings the analysis to a higher level where the leading corrections to finite - size and finite - time scaling become visible .",
    "the approach to @xmath55 in fig .",
    "[ interface scaling exponents ] is consistent with the leading correction to scaling exponent @xmath56 expected from the ew term @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ kpz - equation ] ) .",
    "the corrections to fss are stronger when the height variables are discrete than when they are continuous .",
    "this is consistent with the smaller growth rate in the discrete height interface , and the fact the growth rate is typically proportional to the nonlinear term @xmath58 . on average ,",
    "more material is removed during the first deterministic part of the update process when the surface heights are discrete .",
    "in this section we derive the exact relations between the scaling properties of the avalanches and 1 + 1d kpz interface growth .",
    "however , in the latter the world sheets are sampled in the correlated manner as outlined in sec .",
    "[ moti ] .",
    "the characteristic feature of soc is the lack of typical avalanche length , width , depth , or mass scales .",
    "the probability distributions follow power laws .",
    "for example , the distribution of avalanche widths scales as @xmath59 with scaling exponent @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , the avalanche length , depth , and mass distributions scale as power laws with exponents @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we can summarize this in a metadistribution function @xmath64 ; the probability to find an avalanche of a specific width @xmath65 , length @xmath66 , and depth @xmath67 , obeys the scaling relation @xmath68 with @xmath69 an arbitrary scale parameter .",
    "the exponents @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are expected to be robust with respect to details of the dynamic rule , and thus are characteristic of the universality class to which this avalanche dynamics belongs .",
    "single parameter distributions , such as @xmath73 , follow by integrating out the other variables .",
    "this implies the following expressions for the @xmath74 exponents , @xmath75 or inverted , @xmath76    let s presume that the avalanches are compact , i.e. , that the inside and the boundaries of an avalanche are well defined and distinguishable ( unlike in certain fractal structures ) , and that the sizes of the holes ( unaffected regions ) inside the avalanche do not scale with the avalanche size .",
    "this can be checked visually from typical simulation configurations , and both assumptions are indeed satisfied in our dynamics at least qualitatively . in that case , the mass of the avalanche must scale as @xmath77 , such that the critical exponent of the distribution of avalanche masses @xmath78 obeys the identity @xmath79    there is one more relation between these critical exponents ( leaving only two independent ones ) .",
    "the avalanche is initiated by lowering the bar at the driving edge of the box . in the stationary state",
    "the average surface profile is invariant , and therefore it shifts down at the same rate as the lowering bar .",
    "thus we know how much mass drops out of the box on average .    to be more precise , during each avalanche event , the height of only one single boundary site at @xmath80 is lowered by , on average , an amount @xmath81 . for a sandbox of width @xmath82 the boundary row",
    "is lowered by @xmath81 after @xmath82 avalanches . in the stationary state",
    ", the entire surface matches this lowering speed , such that the amount of removed sand is on average equal to @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the average mass of each avalanche must be equal to @xmath84 the scaling properties of the mass distribution function tie into this because @xmath85 which can be evaluated using the metadistribution function as @xmath86 this equation incorporates finite - size effects .",
    "the box is presumed to be wide and deep enough , such that the the length @xmath87 of the box ( in the direction perpendicular to the driving edge ) is the only limiting finite - size factor .",
    "the first term in the above equation accounts for all avalanches that fit inside the box and the second term for the ones that reach the @xmath88 edge , and thus are prematurely terminated .",
    "the first integral scales as @xmath89 for large @xmath88 .",
    "the second term scales with the same power , because the second integral scales as @xmath90 while the mass factor in front of it scales as @xmath91 .",
    "the result @xmath92 when compared to eq .",
    "( [ conservation of average mass ] ) , yields the exponent identity @xmath93    the validity of these exponent identities goes well beyond our kpz type unloading sandbox . for example , the ew type directed avalanche models by paczuski and bassler  @xcite and kloster _ et al . _",

    "the notation anticipates their identification with the scaling properties of a rough interface in interface growth .",
    "there , @xmath98 is the scaling exponent of the interface width and @xmath2 the dynamic critical exponent .",
    "indeed , the interface width relates to the depth of the avalanche , and time to the the length of the avalanche .",
    "we expect therefore that @xmath98 and @xmath2 take same values as in 1 + 1d kpz growth , @xmath99 and @xmath49 .",
    "we perform mc simulations on the sandbox avalanche model and measure the avalanche metadistribution function @xmath100 , see eq .",

    "the sandbox is always taken wide and deep enough such that the box length @xmath87 acts as the only fss type limiting factor .",
    "we average over @xmath101 avalanches .",
    "the reduced distributions , such as @xmath102 , follow from the metadistribution from , e.g. , summation over @xmath65 and @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ tau exponent plots ] shows fss approximates for the @xmath103 exponents .",
    "they are constructed as follows .",
    "power - law - decaying objects such as @xmath104 are almost always subject to crossover - scaling - type effects , i.e. , subdominant additional power - law terms . in the language of renormalization theory",
    "they originate from so - called irrelevant scaling fields and also from nonlinear scaling field effects .",
    "this is well documented in equilibrium critical phenomena , but most recent nonequilibrium scaling studies ignore this systematic effect , e.g. , by simply making a log - log plot of @xmath105 as function of @xmath66 and drawing a least - square - fitting - type straight line through the data .",
    "such results show very little statistical noise , but can give rise to significant systematic errors .",
    "an example of the importance of corrections to scaling , was the large spread in reported values of the stationary state roughness exponent @xmath98 between various 2d kpz - type - growth lattice models , which was resolved using a similar fss analysis as presented here  @xcite .    in the limit of large @xmath66 the subdominant additional power - law terms fade away .",
    "so , more weight must be put on the large @xmath66 part of the data than on the short @xmath66 section .",
    "however , it is a balancing act , because at large @xmath66 the results become noisier , since few avalanches reach that far .    the total number of avalanches that reach beyond @xmath6 scales as @xmath106 if the fraction of avalanches of length @xmath6 scales as @xmath107 ( these are only the leading terms ) .",
    "we construct a @xmath6 dependent approximate for the exponent @xmath108 from the ratio of these two quantities , as @xmath109 the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ tau exponent plots ] .",
    "( we do the same for the other distributions . )",
    "plots such as this are intrinsically noisier than conventional simple log - log type of plots of the distributions , but they contain much more information . the variation with @xmath6 reflects the leading corrections to scaling . the statistical noise at large @xmath6 could be suppressed by running the mc simulation longer . the simulation time is the only limiting factor .",
    "we used @xmath101 avalanches and in that case , @xmath110 is the optimal box size .    in fig .",
    "[ sigma z alpha plots ] , we replot the same data in terms of @xmath98 , @xmath2 , and @xmath111 , following eq .",

    "we conclude that @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "this means that the exponent relations  ( [ identity1 ] ) and ( [ identity2 ] ) are satisfied well within the statistical noise limitations , i.e. , within a few percent .",
    "surprisingly , the actual values for @xmath2 and @xmath98 , although close , differ significantly from the exactly known 1 + 1d kpz values , @xmath49 and @xmath116 .",
    "they deviate more than warranted from statistical noise alone , and do not converge smoothly if the kpz values are correct .",
    "the approximates for @xmath98 actually undershoot the kpz value @xmath49 , and those for @xmath2 overshoot @xmath116 .",
    "this systematic effect needs to be explained .",
    "it could be that the exponents differ in a fundamental manner from the conventional kpz values , or that we are looking at unusually large and slow corrections to fss .",
    "the smallness of the deviations makes the latter more likely ( except when this happens to be a continuously varying exponents scenario ) .",
    "we will blame the correlated mc averaging feature for this , but it should be noted that avalanche distributions are intrinsically more sensitive to fss effects than global interface features .",
    "many avalanches in the ensemble are small compared to the global box size , and therefore sample and average the kpz scaling properties over much smaller lengths and shorter time scales than in a conventional global interface roughness analysis at a comparable space - time box size .",
    "one option is to push the run button on the computer and out perform all corrections to fss .",
    "unfortunately it would require extremely long mc times , to create large numbers of such large avalanches .",
    "it is doubtful we would be able to get far enough in a reasonable time span .",
    "moreover this approach is intellectually unappealing .",
    "we prefer to search for the origin of the deviations in the exponents .",
    "the basic premise of our exponent identities is that avalanches are like any other fluctuation on a 1 + 1d kpz type world sheet .",
    "initially flat kpz interfaces ( the sand surface next to the driving edge ) roughen in time ( moving away from the driving edge ) in such a manner that at ( kpz ) time @xmath6 the stationary state roughness is established within a length scale @xmath117 .",
    "this defines a so - called spreading cone .",
    "the avalanches are expected to follow the same pattern",
    ". however , the avalanche cone seems to spread slightly faster , since the above avalanche value for @xmath2 slightly exceeds the conventional kpz value , and inside the avalanche the surface seems to be slightly less rough , since the avalanche value for @xmath98 is slightly smaller .    in this and the following section we will establish that this is caused by correlations with previous avalanches .",
    "the new avalanche does not run its course on a pristine fresh kpz interface world sheet but on an aged one scarred by previous avalanches .",
    "there are two obvious tests to address the effects of these scars .",
    "the first one is to determine the avalanche distributions for only the first avalanche on a fresh kpz world sheet ( the initial condition ) , i.e. , to refresh the entire surface completely after each avalanche .",

    "it should be noted that the fss corrections are expected to be larger , and that the data is noisier than in fig .",

    "the stationary state interface width follows from the plateaus at large times .",
    "there the avalanche correlated and uncorrelated mc curves coincide .",
    "this is to be expected , because the large avalanches that span the entire system ( in the @xmath7 direction at large @xmath6 ) occur at regular mc time intervals , such that the large @xmath6 part of the surface ( i.e. , the stationary state of the growth process ) is completely refreshed periodically and therefore sampled effectively like in uncorrelated mc runs . as a result , the roughness exponent @xmath98 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ alpha definition ] ) , is the same for the both cases .",
    "most avalanches do not extend into that large @xmath6 part of the surface .",
    "they terminate in the scarred part of the surface .",

    "[ interface scaling exponents ] , they clearly converge less smoothly , with larger corrections to scaling and we should wonder if they converge to the conventional exact kpz values , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , at all .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ comparing square width ] we plot @xmath124 as function of time , the difference between the squared widths of avalanched correlated mc runs ( the drawn lines in the upper panel ) and completely uncorrelated mc runs ( the dashed lines in the upper panel ) . for infinite system size , @xmath124 scales as @xmath125 with an exponent that numerically is very close to @xmath126 .",
    "since the width itself scales as @xmath127 , it follows that the bumps in the width curves are a transient fss effect .",
    "this settles our basic issue at the numerical level ; the avalanche correlated nature of the mc runs does not change the interface scaling exponents , but only gives rise to slow corrections to fss . in the next two sections we will identify these corrections to scaling with the scars on the surface left behind by previous avalanches .",
    "we start this analysis here by casting the deviations into the framework of corrections to scaling from a so - called irrelevant operator in the sense of renormalization theory .",
    "let @xmath128 be that irrelevant operator and @xmath129 be its scaling field .",

    "the 1d version of the unloading sandbox shows the same type of differences between uncorrelated and avalanche - type correlated mc runs as the 2d version .",
    "we determined numerically the difference between the interface width for avalanche - correlated and uncorrelated mc runs , and found that it diverges as a power law @xmath146 , with an exponent which is again ( like in 2d ) half the size of that for @xmath147 itself . according the corrections to scaling formalism  ( [ irrelevant ] ) ,",
    "the scaling dimension of @xmath0 must therefore be equal to @xmath148 , just as in 2d .",

    "@xmath150 without loss of generality we can set @xmath151 ( measure all lengths in terms of @xmath67 ) .",

    "the number of walkers at a given `` time '' @xmath6 is equal to the number of avalanches of a length @xmath66 equal or larger than @xmath6 in the ensemble of mc runs .",
    "the density of the walkers decays as @xmath153 @xcite , such that the distribution of avalanche lengths obeys the form @xmath154 _ { y = l}\\sim l^{-3/2},\\ ] ] and therefore that @xmath155 .",

    "the mass scales as @xmath158 , i.e. , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .    this can be compared directly with the exponents of other 1d sandpile models , e.g. , with results by paczuski and boettcher  @xcite on the so - called oslo sandpile model where @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "let s turn our attention now to the central issue , the difference between uncorrelated versus avalanche - correlated mc runs . adding a term like @xmath163 to the diffusion equation of motion creates a correction to the drift velocity of the random walk .",
    "this suggests we can identify the geometric meaning of @xmath0 directly by studying the deviations of the slope near the driving edge of the surface from its asymptotic value .",
    "the average surface slope does not show any deviations ( near the driving edge ) from @xmath164 when we run the dynamics as a conventional random walk , which amounts to `` completely refreshing '' the surface after each mc run ( uncorrelated mc runs ) .",
    "the avalanche - correlated runs do show a rounding of the surface near the driving edge @xmath165 the numerical results for the exponent yield @xmath166 , in accordance with @xmath148 from the interface width since @xmath167 and @xmath168 for random walks .",
    "this rounding originates from the distribution of termination points of the avalanches .",
    "a new random walk starts below the previous one and propagates until it meets the previous trajectory and terminates .",
    "the avalanche is the space between the trajectory of that new random walk and the already existent surface .",
    "the amount of rounding of the slope near the driving edge is proportional to the distribution @xmath169 of merging points on the surface .",
    "those are the scars from previous avalanches .",
    "each random walker by itself does not contribute to the rounding , i.e. , on average its walk has constant slope @xmath164 independent of time .",
    "however the merging process truncates each walk and does so in an upwards biased fashion .",
    "each merging event causes the surface to drift upwards by a certain amount ( @xmath164 , in average , for the discrete @xmath13 version ) .",
    "therefore the rounding of the surface is proportional to @xmath169 .    the entire process and the set of subsequent stable sand surfaces ( fig .",
    "[ traces of 1d sand surface ] ) is therefore equivalent to a system of merging random walkers obeying the rule @xmath170 .",
    "that type of dynamics has received extensive attention recently and its various scaling properties are known exactly  @xcite .",
    "there is little doubt that our 1d unloading sandbox is exactly soluble , using absorbing wall type random walk mathematics  @xcite .",
    "however , we will refrain from pursuing this path in this paper .",
    "the critical dimension of @xmath171 can be estimated ( for intuition building purposes ) as follows . after adding a term @xmath163 to the kpz equation we should also write down an equation of motion for @xmath0 itself , to close the equations .",
    "the latter is not trivial , because the scars on the surface build up slowly in time , such that that the equation of motion for @xmath0 is highly nonlocal . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear nature of the diffusion equation allows one to be somewhat frivolous with the order in which averages are taken , ( without losing the essential physics , nor even the correct critical exponents ) .",
    "let @xmath172 be the endpoint distribution after @xmath16 avalanches ( mc time steps ) .",
    "during the last mc time step , one avalanche runs through the system .",
    "it refreshes the entire surface before its termination point @xmath173 , such that @xmath174 at site @xmath6 does not change if the avalanche terminates before @xmath6 ; @xmath175 if it terminates at @xmath6 ; and @xmath176 if it extends beyond @xmath6 : @xmath177 with @xmath178 the probability that the avalanche terminates at distance @xmath66 from the driving edge .",
    "the stationary state endpoint profile therefore takes the form @xmath179 and @xmath180 yields @xmath181 in other words , the surface curvature scales as @xmath182 with @xmath148 , in agreement with the above results .",
    "interestingly , this result is independent of the actual value of the scaling exponent @xmath108 , provided that @xmath183 , which has to be true for @xmath184 to be normalizable .    in conclusion , in 1d we identified the crossover scaling operator with the density of avalanche endpoints .",
    "these represent indeed the scars on the surface , the memory of previous avalanches .",
    "as in the 1d model , the surface slope is modified by the iterated avalanche process . however , unlike in 1d , the average slope near the edge is not constant already in conventional interface dynamics ( where the entire surface is being refreshed during each mc run ) .",
    "the surface slope is related to the growth rate of the underlying interface , and the rounding of the slope near the driving edge represents the transient growth rate of the kpz interface from the initial configuration , e.g. , a flat one : @xmath185 with @xmath6 playing the role of time and the subscript , @xmath186 , denoting that the entire surface is refreshed . by direct numerical simulation of uncorrelated interface dynamics we find @xmath187 ( the left panel of fig .  [ scaling exponents of slope change plot ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with conventional kpz scaling and power counting @xmath188 suggesting @xmath189 .",
    "we evaluate the surface slope profile @xmath190 in avalanche correlated dynamics mc runs , in terms of the difference with respect to the uncorrelated case , @xmath191 the fss analysis for the exponent @xmath192 ( the right panel of fig .",
    "[ scaling exponents of slope change plot ] ) yields @xmath193 .",
    "this is in agreement with @xmath148 and @xmath194 implied by the corrections to scaling formalism  ( [ irrelevant ] ) .",
    "inside the bulk of an avalanche the interface is fully refreshed , and scales as in uncorrelated kpz dynamics . at the avalanche boundaries ,",
    "the slope of the surface is biased upwards , because of the merging with previous mc runs ( which are on average shifted upwards by an amount @xmath195 each time an avalanche is triggered ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath196 is proportional to the density of scars in the surface . in 1d , the scars are point - like objects , the endpoints of the avalanches ; but in 2d the avalanche boundaries are line objects .",
    "this nonscalar aspect makes that most line - segment contributions , when integrated along the boundaries of an avalanche , cancel out against each other .    to be more precise",
    ", @xmath190 represents only the component of the slope in the @xmath6-direction , and the magnitude of those jumps depends on the local angle @xmath197 the boundary makes with the @xmath6-axis .",
    "this is an odd function , @xmath198 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ edge of avalanche ] .",
    "the slope change is negative when the avalanche opens up and positive when it narrows down .",
    "the latter also implies that @xmath199 has opposite sign for the left and right boundary of each avalanche .",
    "notice that , while in the lattice model @xmath197 takes only two discrete values , it renormalizes to a continuous variable at larger length scales .",
    "let s estimate the change in surface slope due to these scars in the same spirit as we did successfully in 1d .",
    "consider one specific surface , and let @xmath200 be the surface slope in a slice of the surface at distance @xmath6 from the driving edge , averaged over all @xmath7 , after @xmath201 avalanches ( mc time @xmath201 ) .",
    "the last avalanche changes this as follows .",
    "let @xmath202 be the width of this avalanche , which terminates at @xmath173 , in slice @xmath203 .",
    "the inside area of the avalanche is completely refreshed and therefore has the same average slope @xmath204 as in ordinary kpz dynamics ( totally refreshed subsequent world sheets ) .",
    "this leads to the following equation of motion , @xmath205   + w_{\\tilde t}(y)[s_{\\rm f}(y)-s_{\\tilde t}(y ) ] \\label{bulk slope change}\\ ] ] the first term on the right hand side represents the creation of the two new avalanche edges , and the second term represents the refreshed surface inside the new avalanche .",
    "note that @xmath206 when this latest avalanche does not reach slice @xmath6 , and that this is automatically taken care of because in that case @xmath207 and @xmath208 , while @xmath209 for @xmath210 . in the stationary state , after averaging over all possible avalanches , eq .",
    "( [ bulk slope change ] ) leads to @xmath211 } = \\overline{\\delta(\\theta_l ) -\\delta(\\theta_r)}\\ ] ] next , we perform an heuristic coarse - graining renormalization - type transformation . at large length scales ,",
    "the average angle @xmath197 remains small , such that the right hand side can approximated as @xmath212 finally , we presume that in the stationary state it is not too bad to treat the kpz height fluctuations deep inside the bulk of an avalanche and those near its edge as decoupled ( at least in lowest order ) such that @xmath213 this yields @xmath214 , exactly the power - law decay we are looking for , and consistent with all the above numerical results .",
    "the only requirement for the latter is that @xmath215 decays as a power law .",
    "again , like in eq .",
    "( [ 1d decay of slope change ] ) for 1d , the value the critical exponent @xmath216 does not matter .",
    "@xmath217 is equal to the average avalanche width in slice @xmath6 averaged over all avalanches .",
    "it is reasonable to expect , and we confirmed numerically , that this quantity scales with the same exponent as the average width of all avalanches longer than @xmath6 , i.e. , as @xmath218 which yields @xmath219 .",
    "we are now ready to represent the crossover scaling operator @xmath220 in terms of the scars on the surface .",
    "consider time slice @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath221 when no scar line runs through site @xmath7 , and otherwise is proportional to the angle the scar line makes with respect to the @xmath6-axis .",
    "however the sign also flips depending on whether this represents a left or right boundary of the original avalanche .",
    "the latter can be denoted by an arrow along the avalanche scar line .",
    "alternatively , we can associate an _",

    "( [ tau exponent equations ] ) . however , we encounter one crucial difference . from the avalanche perspective",
    "the conventional uncorrelated mc runs correspond to completely refreshing the surface , i.e. , an ensemble average over all possible initial conditions , without ever running an avalanche . from the kpz perspective",
    ", the avalanche dynamics represents an unusual mc ensemble averaging procedure where subsequent interface world sheets only differ inside the single avalanche . this avalanche - correlated - type averaging enhances the interface roughness at time scales @xmath123 , due to the scars of previous avalanches .",
    "it required a careful study , combining numerical and analytical tools , presented in the second half of this paper , to establish that these scars give rise only to larger than usual corrections to scaling and not to fundamentally different values of the global roughness scaling exponents @xmath2 and @xmath98 .",
    "the effect of the scars can be represented by introducing an additional age field @xmath222 to the height variables @xmath226 , that keeps track of how many mc runs ago site @xmath227 participated in an avalanche .",
    "this age - field couples into the kpz equation  ( [ kpz - equation ] ) as an additional term of the form @xmath228 .",
    "the operator @xmath0 is proportional to the angle a scar makes with respect to the time - axis , and can be expressed in terms of the age field as shown in eq .",
    "( [ scar - operator ] ) .",
    "we establish that the coupling of this age field to the kpz equation is irrelevant in the sense of renormalization theory , both numerically and by writing down approximate equations of motion for @xmath229 . the scaling field @xmath129 renormalizes with exponent @xmath230 and @xmath0 scales with critical dimension @xmath231 .",
    "we believe that the results of our work presented here can be generalized to most `` markovian '' avalanche dynamic systems with local row - by - row type toppling rules , and that this is a promising route to improve our understanding of the scaling properties of avalanche dynamics in general ."
