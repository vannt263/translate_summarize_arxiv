    "while there is considerable uncertainty regarding the detailed star formation history of galaxies of various masses and types , it has become clear that the span of cosmic time @xmath20 encompasses most of the star formation in the history of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this broad epoch is also when many galaxies were `` assembled , '' when major mergers and the accretion of satellite galaxies and gas combined to produce the variety of morphologies and structures of modern galaxies .",
    "there is mounting evidence for an evolution of star - forming galaxies during this time period , from high - mass galaxies dominating at @xmath21 , to low - mass galaxies at the present .",
    "deep , wide ir surveys are required to cover much of the peak epoch of star formation , because of the redshifting of the key diagnostic spectral features of stellar evolution , and to minimize the effect of obscuration by dust .",
    "the difficulty of obtaining observed - frame near - infrared spectra causes much of our empirical perspective on galaxy evolution to be biased by the way in which spectroscopic samples are selected .",
    "color selection reliably selects common objects , but misses unexpected ones ; magnitude - limited samples necessarily favor bright - continuum objects .",

    "the grisms on the near infrared camera and multi object spectrometer ( nicmos ) , the space telescope imager and spectrograph ( stis ) and the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) have demonstrated the power of spectroscopy from above the atmosphere , where the low background emission permits slitless observing @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the terrestrial wavelength gaps can only be filled from space , as first demonstrated by the pure - parallels program with the nicmos g141 grism @xcite .",

    "thus it is simply a matter of turning on one of the other instruments in the focal plane to obtain quality data in a parallel field , offset by a 5.5and 4.75  from the cos and stis primary target , respectively .",
    "this motivated the strategy of a number of programs using wfc3 in parallel .",
    "two other hst cycle 17 programs were approved , both to do infrared direct imaging ( go-11702 , pi = yan ; go-11700 pi = trenti ) .",
    "pure - parallel observing is perfectly suited to the goals of the wisp survey , since it allows us to obtain deep , continuous , ir spectroscopy in dozens of uncorrelated fields .",
    "we selected our parallel targets with a preference for long integration times and high - galactic - latitude ( @xmath42  degrees out of the galactic plane ) fields . in order to reach similar depths in both the g102 and g141 spectra , we planned an @xmath52.5:1 g102:g141 integration time ratio .",
    "additionally , the process of extracting the slitless spectra from the grism images requires direct imaging of the same fields ( see section [ sec : datared ] ) and so we obtained imaging in f110w and f140w ( corresponding to j110- and h140-band , respectively ) on the same orbits as the grism imaging with an @xmath56:1 grism : direct imaging integration time ratio . to date , we have received , reduced , and analyzed 19 fields ( table  [ tab : schedule ] ) , the results of which are presented here .",
    "cycle 17 was the first year a powerful new procedure was adopted for scheduling and optimizing parallel observations . unlike previous cycles , each of the parallels teams was allowed to select individual observing opportunities , with accurately known durations of each orbital visit , well in advance .",
    "since every parallel visit is unique , with its own combination of full- and partial orbits , we optimized each individual orbit to obtain the exposure time ratios mentioned above in the available time , thereby reaching a carefully balanced set of sensitivities .",
    "this tremendous improvement over earlier years of `` generic '' parallel visits has improved the efficiency of our observing program by about 50% for a fixed allocation of orbits .",
    "we also requested , and were granted , an additional 17 single - orbit parallel observations .",
    "although these were too short for the purposes of other programs , when we observe these new parallel fields in only the f140w and g141 , we are still able to reach comparable depths to the g141 images of many of our multi - orbit fields ( see table [ tab : schedule ] ) .",
    "slitless spectroscopy offers a considerable number of advantages for our wisp program .",
    "the high multiplexing capabilities offered by the wfc3 grisms combined with the observation of a significant number of uncorrelated fields offered by the pure parallel strategy , makes it perfectly suited for survey purposes .",
    "it allows a wide , uncontaminated spectral coverage with stable and accurate calibration .",
    "the ability to combine g102 and g141 grisms , with a well - behaved overlap gives the unique opportunity to find multiple lines per object at faint magnitudes .",
    "because of the well - behaved photometry , it is possible to combine the spectra with broad - band photometry to provide comprehensive and precise spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "moreover , the use of the hst offers a much lower sky background level compared to the ground .",
    "however , to fully exploit the potential of this tool , one needs to overcome some limitations . in crowded fields ,",
    "object spectra and orders sometimes overlap , leading to confusion in the spectral extraction and to uncertainties in the background estimate .",
    "given the high latitude of the wisp fields , crowding did not represent a problem in our observations .",
    "the spectral resolution is determined by the size of the target : for point - like sources , this corresponds to the instrument point spread function ( psf ) , while for extended sources it is the spatial extent of the object in the dispersion direction .",
    "this basic principle of the slitless reduction is the use of the direct images to provide the input catalog of objects .",
    "the object positions , sizes and shapes are then used - in conjunction with a precise knowledge of the mapping between the direct and the dispersed frames to extract photometric and wavelength calibrated 2d and 1d spectra from the data using a 3d flat - field cube which contains the calibration of each detector pixel for each wavelength .",
    "this process has been integrated with the wfc3 pipeline ( calwf3 version 2.0 ) with the provision of the axe software @xcite which has been developed to handle all of the hst slitless spectroscopic modes .",
    "axe maps not only the + first order spectra but also the zeroth , - first , + /-",
    "second and higher order spectra which allows the quantitative estimation of contamination in the case of overlapping objects .",
    "we processed all the data ( including both grism and direct imaging exposures ) using the calwf3 pipeline ( version 2.0 ) .",
    "direct images were corrected for bias , dark , flat - field and gain variation using the best reference files obtained from the stsci archive .",
    "wfc3 performs multiple non - destructive reads in the slitless spectra in multiaccum mode with the sampling sequence spars100 .",
    "this allows cosmic ray rejection in a single exposure sequence .",
    "the reduction pipeline fits the accumulating signal in the the multiaccum readouts to identify the cosmic rays . in the slitless grism data ,",
    "pixels can not be associated with a unique wavelength .",
    "for this reason , calwf3 applies a unity flat so that no pixel - to - pixel correction is applied at this stage .",
    "the proper flat - fielding is then applied during the extraction of the spectra with axe .      because our pure - parallel observations do not allow dithering , the processed images still contain a significant number of bad pixels that were not identified during the calwf3 step .",
    "in addition , calwf3 fails to properly flag a fraction of cosmic ray hits , when these were impacting multiple pixels .",
    "we identify and flag these pixels in the data quality ( dq ) masks using custom idl routines .",
    "finally , the images are combined with the iraf task multidrizzle @xcite using standard parameters .",
    "this step also corrects for bad pixels and cosmic rays , and removes the geometric distortion using the latest distortion solution ( idctab ) files .",
    "the final drizzled images have accurate astrometry and a uniform photometry across the image .",
    "the position of the spectra in the dispersed images is determined by the location of the objects in the corresponding direct exposure .",
    "we run sextractor @xcite on the drizzled direct images , creating independent source catalogs for the f110w and f140w images . for the source detection we used the rms weight maps derived during the multidrizzle step .",
    "every source in the catalogue is required to have at least 6 connected pixels ( detect_minarea @xmath43 ) , with values above 3.5@xmath13 ( detect_thresh @xmath44 ) .",
    "finally , the catalogs generated for the f110w and f140w images are matched and put on the same numbering scheme .",
    "the individual detection in both filters allow us to keep objects detected in only one band and ensures an accurate astrometry between the grism image and the reference direct one .",
    "because axe performs the spectral extraction on individual ( not distortion - corrected ) grism frames , the combined catalog is projected back to these frames to generate an input object list ( iol ) of coordinates for each grism frame to be used in the axe extraction .",
    "starting from these iols , the axe software computes the reference position and spectral trace for each object in the dispersed images .      before proceeding to the actual spectral extraction",
    ", the sky background must be estimated and subtracted from each grism frame .",
    "it is possible , within axe , to estimate the background locally by interpolating on the sky regions above and below the spectral trace .",
    "however , we decided to perform a global sky subtraction on the entire image before proceeding to the extraction of the spectra .",
    "this method proves more efficient for slitless survey data @xcite , where spectra may be be contaminated by the trace of nearby objects , and multiple orders .    in the slitless mode ,",
    "each spatial element of the detector receives the full sky and telescope foreground emission integrated over the grism bandpass .",
    "the grisms disperse the foreground light , but the lack of a slit results in a mapping of spatial to spectral domains that reintegrates uniform sources ( e.g. , the sky ) effectively into undispersed emission .",
    "a portion of the detector does not receive the full zero - order sky and thus there is a ramp in the sky in the first one hundred or so columns on the detector .",
    "the sky foreground in the g141 and g102 grisms is a combination of zodiacal light , earth limb and thermal emission from the telescope .",
    "the processed two - dimensional grism images contain a significant signal from these sources that must be removed for proper photometric calibration , as well as for optimal identification of spectral features .",
    "we constructed a master sky template for each grism by making a stack of all of our grism exposures .",
    "the individual images were first scaled using the image mode , then combined with a median stack .",
    "the resulting master sky contains low - level residuals from bright sources , but these have little impact on our results .",
    "our sky template is being improved as additional independent fields are observed and added to the master sky .",
    "for each grism observation we scaled the appropriate master sky and subtracted this from the post - pipeline two - dimensional image .",
    "we experimented with scaling the sky by the mode of the pixel distributions and by minimizing the sigma in the sky subtracted image .",
    "these two approaches gave nearly identical results , and we proceeded with the skies scaled using the mode .",
    "the scale factors varied by more than a factor of two from one field to another , reflecting the changing zodiacal light background and contribution from the earth s limb .    as in the direct images",
    ", the calwf3 processed data still showed residual bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "we constructed a bad - pixel mask in which we flagged all bad pixels , including those with low - qe and with high value of the dark current .",
    "we then interpolated over these flagged pixels along the dispersion direction using a second order polynomial .",
    "we find that the majority of the bad pixels are isolated , and most interpolations were over at most @xmath45 pixels .",
    "thus the interpolation step does not introduce spurious features into the spectra .",
    "moreover , because the position of each bad pixel is recorded in the masks , we have checked that the identified emission lines ( see below ) were not impacted by the interpolation process .",
    "finally , we created the final dispersed images by averaging together the corrected frames , weighting each image by its exposure time .",
    "these frames were used in our visual inspection .",
    "+     we also run multidrizzle on the individual grism frames .",
    "this has the advantage of performing cosmic ray rejection and flagging the affected pixels in these frames .",
    "however the drizzled grism image is not used for extraction .",
    "the axe procedure extracts the spectra from the individual grism images and all flagged pixels will be ignored during this process .",
    "another advantage of applying multidrizzle on both direct and grism frames is to avoid potential differences in the wcs data for the two images that could lead to a mismatch in the source positions in the direct and grism individual images during the extraction .",
    "the spectral extraction is performed with the slitless extraction package axe ( version 2.0 ) developed at space telescope european coordinating facility ( st - ecf ) .",
    "the input image list is prepared with each individual grism image paired with the direct image which is closest in time and its sextractor catalog .",
    "we used the latest in - orbit configuration files @xcite and thermal vacuum ( tv ) 3 sensitivity calibrations .",
    "some of these reference files will be improved for later reductions .",
    "we compared several apertures and orientation parameter setups to optimize the extraction .",
    "we used an aperture width of twice the object size listed in the input object list , and an extraction direction perpendicular to the spectral trace ( see axe user manualsoftware / axe/ ] for details ) .",
    "two - dimensional cutout spectra of each object in each exposure are extracted and then combined ( with axedrizzle ) to create a final high signal - to - noise ( @xmath46 ) ratio spectrum .",
    "the combined 2d spectrum is then used to extract the final object spectrum .",
    "we used optimal extraction to increase the @xmath46 ratio of the extracted spectra .",
    "the spectral contamination by spectra of nearby objects is estimated by axe using the object positions and magnitudes in the direct image .",
    "we adopted the gaussian emission model , using sextractor size parameters , to approximate the object morphology .",
    "the simulated spectrum is then extracted and used to estimate the contamination to each object .",
    "each stacked two - dimensional grism frame was searched visually by two or more of the authors .",
    "we used the dispersion solution from the wfc3 configuration files to determine the positions of the aperture beams in both grisms .",
    "the 1st order of each object is then marked with the corresponding aperture beam and the original i d number in the iol .",
    "the actual search area is about 3.3 arcmin@xmath6 , smaller than the ir channel field of view . because of the shift between direct and grism images , spectra on the left part of the field do not have detections in the direct image , and zeroth orders",
    "can not be identified at the far - right side of the frame .",
    "some examples of 1st and 2nd order aperture beams are shown in figure  [ fig : raw_clean ] by the long rectangular boxes .",
    "besides the overlap between the objects , the most important spurious feature is the zero - order image .",
    "because the light is not dispersed , the zero - order image could be easily confused with an emission line .",
    "we derived the position of all the zero - orders in the grism exposures , using the positions of all the sources in the direct images .",
    "we marked the zero - orders in the grism exposures to be able to exclude them during the visual inspection of the grism images . in figure",
    "[ fig : raw_clean ] we show an example of this procedure : the blue circles show the zero order location of some of the objects detected in the direct images . with all possible contaminants identified in the grism images",
    ", we proceeded to compile a list of all emission - line source in each field .",
    "we compared the g102 and g141 spectra of each field side - by - side , to aid in the identification of genuine emission - lines . in many cases",
    "the identification of the lines is unambiguous .",
    "for exampe , galaxies with h@xmath15 often also have detectable [ sii]6717/6731 and sometimes [ siii]9069,9532 emission ( figure [ fig : examples1 ] ) . strong [ oiii]5007,4959 emission in the g102 grism is easily recognized on the basis of h@xmath15 in the g141 and often h@xmath47 in the g102 spectra , even though the two [ oiii ] lines are blended ( see figure [ fig : examples2 ] ) . at higher redshifts ,",
    "strong [ oiii]5007,4959 in the g141 grism is confirmed by faint h@xmath47 emission . in some cases",
    "[ oii]3727 can be seen in the g102 spectra for sources with strong [ oiii]5007 in the g141 spectra ( figure [ fig : examples3 ] ) .",
    "+   +      +   +     +   +   +    there are a large number of objects with only a single faint emission - line in the full spectral range covered by the two grisms .",
    "it it most probable that these are weak h@xmath15 emission lines for which we are unable to detect other lines .",
    "however , since we see many [ oiii]/h@xmath15  pairs up to @xmath48 we expect , in absence of other indication , to have a fraction of the single lines in the g141 that would correspond to [ oiii ] whereas h@xmath15  has moved out of the g141 grism .",
    "the [ oii]3727 line is seldom recognized as a redshift indicator by itself , since in this case it is more likely to be an h@xmath15  line at low - z rather than a high - z [ ] line .",
    "there are some objects , however , for which we believe the single line in the g141 spectrum is [ oiii]5007,4959 .",
    "this is primarily based on the lack of continuum in the g102 spectra , indicative of the fall off in the continuum below the balmer and 4000 angstrom breaks .",
    "each emission feature was assigned a confidence flag , ranging from 0 to 4 in order of decreasing confidence . the highest confidence level ( class 0 )",
    "was assigned to objects with multiple emission features and unambiguous redshifts .",
    "confidence classes 1 , 2 and 3 were assigned to single features with unambiguous identifications ( class 1 ) , good quality ( class 2 ) , moderate quality ( class 3 ) , and uncertain ( class 4 , which are not included in the present analysis ) .",
    "similar confidence classes have been used in ground - based redshift surveys ( e.g. cfrs , @xcite ; gdds , @xcite ) and have been found to be useful in restricting various types of analysis to high confidence objects .",
    "monte carlo simulations will be used to assess the flux completeness and reassess the confidence levels when the data set is complete .",
