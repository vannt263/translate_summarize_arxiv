    "in the standard cosmological framework , the universe is decribed by a friedmann - lemaitre solution , the spatial sections of which being usually assumed to be simply  connected .",
    "einstein equations being local , they allow us to determine the local geometry but they give no complete information about the global structure of the universe , i.e. about its topology , even if the geometry constrains to some extent the topology .",
    "this was pointed out by friedmann himself just after he proposed its cosmological solution @xcite .",
    "the indeterminacy about the global topology of the cosmological solutions was raised out as soon as einstein proposed the first cosmological solution of his equations  ; the einstein static universe assumed spatial sections with the topology of the hypersphere @xmath1 @xcite , although de sitter stressed that the same geometry could admit as well the projective space @xmath2 as spatial sections @xcite .",
    "these two solutions were locally identical ( same metric ) but differed by their topology , i.e. by the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "many arguments were then advanced in favour of a simply  connected universe , such as the simplicity or economy principle stating that one should introduce as few parameters as possible in physical modelling .",
    "indeed , such an argument is very unclear .",
    "there has been some tendency to favor spaces with finite volume .",
    "the eternal and infinite space of newtonian physics was for instance leading to logical difficulties such as the olbers paradox @xcite , and the finite cosmological solution proposed by einstein in 1917 was received as a smart way of solving such paradoxes .",
    "the mach s principle @xcite based on the idea that the local inertia is determined by the distribution of masses in the whole universe , also tends to favor universes with a finite volume .",
    "if space is simply  connected then it is finite if and only if it is locally elliptic , whereas if multi ",
    "connected it can also be locally hyperbolic or euclidean .",
    "it has also been argued that infinite spaces were unaesthetic since `` all phenomenon with a non vanishing probability must happen somewhere else '' @xcite .",
    "this argument was used by ellis to conclude that if space was infinite then one can avoid the former conclusion by dropping the assumption of spatial homogeneity and by arguing that we were living in a particular place of the universe @xcite .",
    "to finish , many arguments coming from some ideas in quantum cosmology are in favor of a finite volume space @xcite . indeed",
    ", none of these arguments can help us to determine the shape and size of our universe .",
    "so , we are lead to the question , can we detect or constrain observationnally the topology of our universe  ?",
    "astonishingly enough , our century has on one hand seen the birth of the geometrical description of the universe and of a non static curved spacetime . on the other",
    ", mathematicians have developped the classification of 3d  manifolds .",
    "the first motivation came from crystallography , which lead to the classification of euclidean 3d ",
    "manifolds @xcite and was achieved in 1934 @xcite .",
    "the classification of locally elliptic 3-manifold was set by f. klein @xcite and w. killing @xcite and solved by j.a .",
    "wolf in 1960 @xcite .",
    "the classification of locally hyperbolic manifold was started in the 70 s by w. thurston @xcite and is not yet achieved @xcite . thus both elements necessary to answer the question of cosmic topology were developped at the same time without interacting so much . for more details concerning this interesting modern quest",
    ", one can see @xcite .",
    "in relativistic cosmology , our universe is described by a globally hyperbolic 4manifold @xmath3 @xcite , where the spatial sections @xmath4 are homogeneous and isotropic riemannian 3manifolds . from a topological point of view , it is convenient to decribe such a manifold by its fundamental polyhedron ( hereafter fp ) , which is convex .",
    "its faces are associated by pairs through the elements of a holonomy group @xmath5 which is acting freely and discontinuously on @xmath4 ( see @xcite for mathematical definitions and @xcite for an introduction to topology in the cosmological context ) .",
    "the holonomy group is isomorphic to the fundamental group @xmath6 . using the property ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath7 we deduce that the study of the topology of the universe reduces to the study of the topology of its spatial sections .",
    "what are the allowed homogeneous 3manifolds usable in cosmology  ? according to the sign of the spatial curvature @xmath8 , the universal covering space of the spatial sections ( which will be referred to as @xmath9 ) can be described by the euclidean space @xmath10 , the hypersphere @xmath11 or the 3-hyperboloid @xmath12 if @xmath8 vanishes , is positive or negative respectively .",
    "thus , the homogeneous and isotropic 3-manifolds will be of the form @xmath13 let us just summarize some of the properties of each family and also introduce @xmath14 , the full isometry group of @xmath9 keeping the metric invariant .",
    "indeed @xmath15 will be a discrete sub - group of @xmath14 .    1 .   : the covering space in the euclidean space @xmath16 and the isometry group is @xmath17 .",
    "the metric can be written under the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the conformal time , @xmath20 the scale factor , @xmath21 the radial coordinate and @xmath22 the unit solid angle .",
    "the generator of @xmath15 are the identity , the translations , the reflexions and the helicoidal motions .",
    "+ these transformations generate 18 different spaces @xcite among which 17 are multi  connected and correspond to the 17 crystallographic groups @xcite .",
    "10 spaces are compact and among them 6 are orientable .",
    "the description of these spaces can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "2 .   : the covering space in the elliptic space @xmath23 and the isometry group is @xmath24 .",
    "the metric can be written as @xmath25 with the curvature radius as unit length , the volume of the hypersphere is @xmath26 wolf @xcite gives an exhaustive description of the allowed discrete groups @xmath15 .",
    "they are the cyclic groups of order @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , the dihedral groups of order @xmath29 , and the symmetry groups of the tetrahedron , octaedron and icosahedron .",
    "+ if we denote @xmath30 the order of the holonomy group , it is straigthforward to show that @xmath31 which tells us that the volume of an elliptic manifold is a topological invariant ( degenerate since two different groups with same order will have same volume ) .",
    "3 .   : the covering space in the hyperbolic space @xmath32 and the isometry group is @xmath33 .",
    "the metric can be written as @xmath34 + the classification of compact hyperbolic manifolds is not achieved yet and we will just describe two of them and give some useful properties .",
    "this classification relies on the rigidity theorem @xcite stating that the geometry is fixed by the topology , a consequence of which being that the volume and other characteristic lengths are topological invariants , so that @xmath35 it has also been shown that there is a minimal allowed volume @xcite @xmath36 we also define the outside radius @xmath37 , the radius of the smallest geodesic ball that contains the fp , the inside radius @xmath38 , the radius of the biggest geodesic ball contained in the fp , and the injectivity radius @xmath39 , half the length of the shortest closed geodesic .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are altogether topological invariants .",
    "+ the classification and the description of the known compact hyperbolic manifolds can be obtained by using the software _ snappea _ @xcite which provides the fp , the generators of the holomy group and the characteristic lengths .",
    "examples of such manifolds can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "here we mention for a later use a manifold of special interest , the weeks space @xcite , which is the smallest known compact hypermabolic manifold .",
    "its fp has 18 faces and its geometrical characteristics are @xmath40      at the time being , two classes of methods to detect and/or constrain the topology of the spatial sections of our universe have been proposed and investigated .",
    "they use two classes of cosmological observations , namely the 2d cosmic microwave background data and the 3d catalogs of discrete sources .    1 .   :",
    "the cosmic microwave background is composed of all the photons emitted during the decoupling period between matter and radiation at a redshift of @xmath41 .",
    "it is observed as a black body with a temperature of @xmath42 k with small fluctuations of order @xmath43 .",
    "the temperature anisotropies reflect the small inhomogeneities that ultimately lead to the observed structures in the universe .",
    "+ when studying these anisotropies in a multi  connected universe , one has to take into account the fact that we are in a compact manifold and thus that the wavelengths must be discretized .",
    "@xcite showed that in a cubic hypertorus one should see a cut  off in the two  point correlation function if @xmath44 .",
    "this analysis was then generalised to non cubic hypertorus @xcite and to the six flat manifolds @xcite",
    ". however , in compact hyperbolic manifolds there are super - curvature modes @xcite , which implies that no such cut  off exists @xcite .",
    "+ it has then been realised that the patterns on such an extended surface must be correlated if the universe is multi - connected .",
    "@xcite studied these correlations in the flat manifolds and cornish _ et al . _",
    "@xcite developped a topology independent method to look for a topological signature in the cosmic microwave background map as expected from the map and planck satellites .",
    "+ all these studies have been performed assuming that the small initial inhomogeneities where generated during an inflationary phase .",
    "there is however another process that could generate such inhomogeneities , namely topological defects produced during a symmetry breaking phase transition in the early universe .",
    "uzan and peter @xcite showed that the topology implies a constraint on the topological defects network from which it was deduced @xcite that there will be a cut  off in the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropies , the cut  off value depending only on the characteristic size of the universe and on the cosmological parameters . note that such considerations also provide another method for constraining the topology , namely the observation of an extended defect at a redshift @xmath45",
    "will give a lower bound on the size of the universe .",
    "+ in conclusion , at the moment 2d  methods constrain flat manifolds to @xmath44 , and there is no convincing constraint on compact hyperbolic manifolds @xcite .",
    "some powerful methods can be hoped to be used when high resolution cosmic microwave background maps are achieved .",
    "2 .   : in the framework of pre  relativistic cosmology , it was already pointed out by schwarzschild that if space is multi  connected , one could see multiple images of astronomical objects @xcite , whereas friedmann @xcite did the same in the framework of general relativity .",
    "all 3d  methods for testing the space topology are based on this fact .",
    "we shall develop their description in the following sections .    in these proceedings , we describe the developments of the 3d  methods , from the schwarzschild initial idea of the existence of multiple images of the same object , until its statistical implementation under the form of cosmic cristallography .",
    "we then carefully study the method and explain why , contrary to what was previously thought , it wo nt work in locally hyperbolic universes .",
    "we then present attempts to generalise it and finish by describing a new and promising  ccp \" method .",
    "this will be examplified by numerical simulations with depiction of color pictures in order to make the subject as clear as possible .",
    "as stressed above , if space is multi  connected , one should see multiple  topological \" images of the same object .",
    "this is illustrated on figure [ fig4 ] where we have used a 2d example . in the universal covering space",
    ", the spacetime trajectories of the different images ( @xmath46 ) of a given object will intersect the observer past light cone at different times ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the same object will then been seen at different stages of its evolution . indeed in a 4d universe , these images will also be seen in different directions of the sky .",
    "the question is indeed to find methods to implement such a property in order to detect or to put lower bounds on the size of the universe .",
    "some specific objects have been tried to be recognised individually .",
    "an extensive description of these attempts can be found in @xcite and we just stick to a brief description .    * milky way : can we recognise our own galaxy  ?",
    "the maximum distance up to which we would be able to do that has been estimated as @xmath48 by sokolov and shvartsmann @xcite which gave the observational bound @xmath49 .",
    "then , fagundes and wichoski @xcite proposed that our galaxy was a quasar long ago but indeed , for physical reasons due to realistic quasar models , our galaxy can not have been a quasar in its past .",
    "fagundes @xcite also studied the occurrence of images of the milky way in the best hyperbolic space model @xcite .",
    "presently , no source has been identified as an image of our own galaxy . *",
    "galaxy clusters  : gott used the coma cluster @xcite has a candidate for the search of ghosts images and obtained the bound @xmath50 .",
    "he also performed simulations in @xmath51 to provide a pattern of clustering and a correlation function in agreement with observations of nearby galaxies .",
    "roukema and edge @xcite proposed 3 candidates as ghost images for the coma cluster .",
    "further investigations are needed .",
    "+ sokoloff and shvartsmann @xcite considered the abell catalog of clusters and gave the bound @xmath52 in euclidean space , whereas demianski and lapucha @xcite searched unsuccessfully for opposite pairs in a catalog of 1889 clusters .",
    "developped a statistical method that is presented below to obtain @xmath53 in euclidean space and fetisova _ et al .",
    "_ reported a spike about @xmath54 in the correlation function of rich clusters , but such an evidence does not necessarily supports multi  connectedness ( see e.g. @xcite ) . *",
    "quasars : quasars occupy a large volume of the universe ( @xmath55 ) . however , they are probably short - lived compared to the expected time necessary for a photon to go around the universe . if @xmath56 , then one can hope to test topology on scale @xmath57 .",
    "so , they are of interest even if @xmath58 .",
    "pal @xcite remarked that although individual quasars may have short lifetime , they may be part of larger associations which survive longer .",
    "+ roukema @xcite tried to identify quintuplets and quadruplets of quasars in a catalog of 4554 quasars .",
    "he found 27 identifications whereas he found @xmath59 identifications in simulations of a simply  connected universe .",
    "fagundes @xcite tried to discuss the redshift contreversy in the best @xcite model .",
    "until now , the best bound obtained by 3d  methods was @xmath60 and hold only in euclidean universe .",
    "there is still some observational room for the topologies of an hyperbolic universe , even on scales significantly shorter than the horizon radius .",
    "all the methods trying to recognize a particular object suffer from the same major problems :    1 .",
    "distance determination : catalogs give the angular position and the redshift .",
    "one has then to go from redshift space to real space , which depends on the knowledge of the cosmological constant and of the density parameter .",
    "this explained why most of the former studies were performed assuming @xmath61 .",
    "this point will be develop later .",
    "peculiar velocities : objects are not comoving , so that the position of their topological images are shifted . if their velocity is of order @xmath62 , then , assuming that the time for a photon to go around the universe can be estimated by @xmath63 , one obtains the maximal precision on the determination of position @xmath64 .",
    "morphology : when one tries to associate two images to the same physical object , one has to be aware that , in general , the object will not be seen in the same angle and at the same stage of its evolution .",
    "it will then be very difficult to recognise it and the identification will strongly depend on galactic evolution models .",
    "conversely , the discovery of topology by any means could provide informations such as peculiar velocities with a better accuracy @xcite",
    ". we will also be able to see the same object at different stages of its evolution and on different angles , which will constrain galactic evolution models .",
    "since there is little chance to recognise different images of a given object , one can try to detect these images statistically , since for instance the number of topological images of a single object in a toroidal universe has been estimated in table [ tab ] of @xcite .    *",

    "indeed , we do not know these holomies as far as we have not determined the topology , but we know that they are isometries . for instance in locally euclidean universes , to each holonomy is associated a distance @xmath70 , equal to the length of the translation by which the fundamental domain is moved to produce the tessellation in the covering space . assuming the fp contains @xmath71 objects ( e.g. galaxy clusters ) , if we calculate the mutual 3d  distances between every pair of topological images ( inside the particle horizon )",
    ", the distances @xmath70 will occur @xmath71 times for each copy of the fundamental domain , and all other distances will be spread in a smooth way between zero and two times the horizon distance . in a histogram",
    "plotting the number of pairs versus their 3d separations , the distances @xmath70 will thus produce spikes .",
    "simulations indeed showed that the pairs between two topological images of the same object drastically emerge from ordinary pairs @xcite in the histogram .",
    "the applicability of the method in euclidean spaces has also been discussed by fagundes and gaussmann @xcite when the size of the physical space is comparable to the horizon size",
    ".    two kind of catalogs of astronomical objects can be thought of to apply this method : the galaxy cluster catalogs , which typically have a redshift depth @xmath72 , and the quasars catalogs , which typically extend to @xmath73 . concerning quasars , even if their lifetime is probably too short to be good candidates for producing topological images , they are usually part of systems that have a much larger lifetime @xcite .",
    "let us stress that a recent survey @xcite in the hubble deep field south nicmos field found 17 galaxies with a redshift between 5 and 10 and 5 galaxies with a redshift above 10 , among a total of 323 galaxies .",
    "this can let us hope to apply this method to deeper catalogs in the future .",
    "the angular resolution needed is given by the fact that the objects have a peculiar velocity and that they will not be seen at exactly the same position @xcite .",
    "note that the crystallographic method , contrary to the `` direct '' method which would try to recognize topological images of individual objects , is not plagued by the fact that topological images of the same object are seen at different stages of its evolution .",
    "we present on figure [ fig5 ] an example from @xcite for the flat torus with a cubic fp .",
    "now , we apply this method to a catalog @xcite containing more than 11,000 quasars up to a redshift of @xmath74 ( see figure [ catq ] where we have depicted its projection on the celestial sphere and the redshift distribution of its objects ) .",
    "the pair separation histogram is plotted on figure [ psh ] and it exhibits no topological signature . since respectively 60  % , 80  % and 95  % of the sources are below the redshifts 2 , 2.3 and 3 , we only test scales smaller that @xmath75 .    in a locally euclidean universe , the distance - redshift relation is given by @xcite @xmath76 we simulated a catalog with the same number of objects and the same redshift distribution to reproduce the real catalog depicted in figure [ catq ] . varying the size of cubic hypertorus",
    ", a spike appears when @xmath77 for the simulated catalog and thus we obtain the new bound on the size of a locally euclidean manifold as @xmath78 which is the best constraint presently available with 3d ",
    "methods for locally euclidean manifolds .",
    "note that it corresponds to @xmath79 which is comparable to the bound obtained with 2d  methods .",
    "note that this result has not been published elsewhere .",
    "when one looks carefully at the crystallographic method , one must wonder about the origin of the spikes . as it has recently been explained @xcite , two kinds of pairs can create a spike , namely ( we keep the notation and vocabulary introduced in @xcite )    1 .",
    "_ type i pairs _ of the form @xmath80 , since @xmath81=\\hbox{dist}[x , y]$ ] for all points and all elements @xmath82 of @xmath15 .",
    "type ii pairs _ of the form @xmath83 if @xmath84=\\hbox{dist}[y , g(y)]$ ] for at least some points and elements @xmath82 of @xmath15 .    both families of pairs",
    "are depicted on figure [ fig6 ] for the example of the 2torus .",
    "a clifford translation is an isometry @xmath82 such that the displacement function @xmath85 is constant @xcite .",
    "this is precisely what is required to get type ii pairs in the histogram .    in compact hyperbolic manifolds , @xmath84",
    "$ ] always depends on the position @xmath86 of the source ( see @xcite for details ) .    in elliptic spaces ,",
    "distances are position - independent whenever the holonomy is a clifford translation .",
    "all finite groups of clifford translations of spheres are the cyclic group , the binary dihedral , tetrahedral , octahedral and icosahedral groups @xcite , from which we deduce @xcite that the covering transformations which move a source to its nearest neighbours are clifford translations ( although the transformations to more distant neighbours might not be ) , and type ii pairs can be produced .    in locally euclidean universes ,",
    "type i and type ii pairs are both present .",
    "the reason is that the 3-torus has the very special property that the separation distance of gg - pairs ( i.e. any pair of images comprising an original and one of its ghosts , or two ghosts of the same object ) is independent of the location of the source . in other euclidean spaces",
    "the spectrum of gg - pair distances varies with the location of the source .",
    "however all closed euclidean 3-manifolds have the 3-torus as a covering space , so for each such manifold there will be some distances which are independent of the location of the source . as a consequence , the topological signal expected in the histogram from type i and type ii pairs clearly stands out , as was shown in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "+ in conclusion , type ii pairs exist only in elliptic and euclidean universes .",
    "the question we still have to answer to judge the efficiency of the crystallographic method in the general case is : what about the amplitude of the spikes related to type i pairs only",
    "?      if the injectivity radius of the space manifold is smaller than the calatog s length scale , type i pairs will always be present , whatever the curvature .",
    "their number roughly equals the number of copies of the fundamental domain within the catalog s limits . following @xcite ,",
    "this number can easily been estimated by computing the ratio between the volume of the geodesic sphere of radius @xmath87 and the volume of the manifold .",
    "the calculation ( in the case of hyperbolic universes ) leads to @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the radial distance corresponding to the redshift @xmath90 , given @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are respectively the density parameter and the cosmological constant .",
    "we have plotted on figure [ fig8 ] an estimation of the number of copies of an object taken respectively in a catalog of galaxy clusters and in a catalog of quasars , as a function of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the small number of type i pairs in hyperbolic manifolds is due to the property that the volume of the manifold is fixed once the topology is determined ( the _ rigidity theorem _ ) , contrarily to euclidean spaces where the characteristic sizes and the volume of the fp can be chosen at will ( since @xmath94 , the geometry does notimpose any characteristic size ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "type i pairs will indeed contribute to spikes in the pair separation histogram but the amplitude of these spikes will be of the same order than the statistical noise .",
    "the former conclusion can be tested numerically .",
    "for that purpose , we concentrate on locally hyperbolic three  dimensional manifolds . it can be first embedded in a four  dimensional minkowski space by introducing the set of coordinates @xmath95 related to the intrinsic coordinates @xmath96 through ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath97 so that the three  dimensional hyperboloid @xmath12 has the equation @xmath98 with these notations , the comoving spatial distance between two points of comoving coordinates @xmath86 and @xmath99 can be computed directly in the minkowski space by @xcite @xmath100=\\arg\\cosh{\\left[x^\\mu y_\\mu\\right]},\\ ] ] where @xmath101 , @xmath102 being the minkowskian metric coefficients .    to generate an idealised catalog , @xmath103 ,",
    "we first distribute _ homogeneously _",
    "@xmath71 objects in the fp , then we by unfold the catalog by applying the generators of the holonomy group . now , to generate a catalog with the required depth @xmath104 in redshift , the set of all points obtained as above",
    "must be truncated in order to keep only the points @xmath86 such that @xmath105\\leq \\chi(\\omega_{m0},\\omega_{\\lambda0};z_{\\rm max})$ ] , given by equation ( [ chi1 ] ) .",
    "this amounts to select objects located within the geodesic ball of radius @xmath106 centered onto an observer right at the centre .",
    "the unfolding of weeks manifold is shown in figure [ fig9 ] , where we have depicted the central cell and its 18 nearest neighbours in klein coordinates . in figure",
    "[ fig10 ] , we have plotted a simulated catalog showing all points , including those outside the horizon distance .",
    "we then compute all the 3d separations between all the pairs of @xmath107 and we plot the histogram of the number of pairs with a given separation .",
    "+ indeed the former procedure applies when the observer stands at the center of the polyhedron @xmath108 . in @xcite , we explain how to take into account an off - centered observer . + in lehoucq et al .",
    "@xcite , we have generated some pair histograms in a universe whose spatial sections have the topology of the weeks manifold , using @xmath109 objects in the fp . in figure [ fig11 ]",
    "we give an example wher @xmath110 , @xmath111 and where the observer stands at the center of the polyhedron ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the dependence on the cosmological parameters , on the position of the observer and on the catalog depth where studied in details in @xcite .",
    "as expected , none of the plots exhibit spikes .",
    "this is due to the combined effects of the geometry and of the cosmological parameters values .    to summarize the failure of cosmic crystallography for hyperbolic manifolds :    1 .",
    "hyperbolic manifolds are such that @xmath84 $ ] depends on @xmath86 , so that there is no amplification for the _ type ii pairs _",
    "@xmath113 , whereas @xmath84=\\hbox{dist}[y , g(y)]$ ] in the euclidean case .",
    "this suppresses the corresponding spikes .",
    "2 .   the spikes associated to the isometries ( i.e. such that @xmath114=\\hbox{dist}[x , y]$ ] ) must remain . but , given the cosmological parameters , we have shown that the number of topological images is too low to create such spikes associated to _ type i pairs_.",
    "the next question is : can we generalise the crystallographic method in order to make it work in any case  ?",
    "two solutions were proposed almost immediately to improve the crystallographic method and to extract from 3d catalogs the signature of type i pairs :    1 .",
    "fagundes and gaussman @xcite substracted the pair separation histogram for a simulated catalog ( with the same number of objects and the same cosmological parameters ) in a simply - connected universe to the observed pair separation histogram .",
    "the result is `` a plot with much oscillation on small scale , modulated by a long wavelength quasi - sinusoidal pattern '' .",
    "the statistical relevance of this signature still has to be investigated . to illustrate this point we show on figure [ fig12 ] the result of a simulation where we have substracted to realisations on a simply - connected friedmann - lemaitre universe",
    "this has to be compared with figure 1 from @xcite and let us think that is method is not efficient for determining a relevant signature of the topology of the universe .",
    "2 .   gomero _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed to split the catalog in `` smaller '' catalogs and average the pair separation histograms built from each sub  catalog to reduce the statistical noise and extract a visible signal of the non - translational isometries .",
    "the feasability of this method has not yet been demonstrated .",
    "we now present a new method @xcite based on the property that whatever the topology , type i pairs will always exist . indeed ,",
    "as shown ahead , this does not lead to any observable spike in the pair separation histogram .",
    "we thus had to find a method to enhance the topological signal by `` collecting '' all the homologous pairs together .",
    "this can be achieved by building a _ collecting correlated pairs _",
    "method ( hereafter _ ccp _ ) .",
    "such an approach ( described in details in @xcite and below ) is not able to determine the exact topology , but will provide a signature of the compactness of the spatial sections , which is indeed a first step toward the determination ( or the rejection ) of the cosmic topology .    in this section , we recall the construction of the ccp  index and the main resuts we have obtained .",

    "both the @xmath121pairs and the @xmath125-pairs are type i pairs .    to collect all these pairs together and enhance the topological signal , we define the _ ccp  index _ of a catalog containing @xmath71 objects as follows .    1 .",
    "we compute all the 3d ",
    "distances @xmath126 $ ] for all points within the catalog s limit .",
    "we order all these distances in a list @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the number of pairs , such that @xmath129 .",
    "we create a new list of increments defined by @xmath130,\\quad \\delta_i\\equiv d_{i+1}-d_i\\ ] ] ( keeping all the equal distances , if any , in the list ) .",
    "we then define the ccp  index @xmath131 as @xmath132",
    "where @xmath133 , so that @xmath134 .    with such a procedure , all type i pairs will contribute to @xmath135 .",
    "for instance , if a given distance appears 4 times in the list @xmath127 , it will contribute to 3 counts in @xmath135 .",
    "compared to the old crystallographic method , all the correlated pairs are gathered into a single spike , instead of being smoothed out into the noise of the histogram pair separation .    indeed , in a more realistic situation",
    ", one has to take into account bins of finite width @xmath136 and replace @xmath135 by @xmath137 in the computation of @xmath131 .",
    "the effect of this `` binning '' is discussed below .",
    "we now focus on the `` idealised '' version of the procedure by studying the amplitude of the ccp  index in some multi - connected models .",
    "+ for that purpose , let us assume that the catalog is obtained from an initial set of @xmath138 objects lying in the fundamental domain and that @xmath139 copies of the domain are within the catalog s limits ( @xmath140 if the whole observable universe up to the catalog s limit is included inside a fundamental domain ) .",
    "the total number of images is @xmath141 .",
    "indeed @xmath139 is usually not an integer but we assume it is , in order to estimate the amplitude of @xmath131 and compare it with the result in a simply - connected model . in @xcite , it has been shown that @xmath142 , \\label{amplitude}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is a function characterising the manifold @xmath4 .",
    "it is an increasing function of @xmath139 which vanishes for @xmath140 .    indeed ,",
    "if the holonomy group @xmath15 contains clifford translations allowing for type ii pairs , or if there are `` fake '' pairs ( i.e. such that @xmath126=\\hbox{dist}[u , v]$ ] ) , @xmath144 computed from ( [ amplitude ] ) will give a lower bound for the true @xmath145 .    the normalised ccp  index ( [ ccp ] ) follows straightforwardly .",
    "@xmath131 is a good index for extracting the topological signal since    1 .   when @xmath146 ( i.e. when the fundamental domain is greater than the catalog s spatial scale ) , @xmath147 , 2 .",
    "when the number of sources in the fundamental domain becomes large , it behaves as @xmath148    as shown in @xcite , one can compute analytically the ccp  index in various examples and show that it is a fair indicator of the existence of at least one compact spatial dimension .",
    "now that the ccp  index can be computed for any multi - connected space , we can compare it with its value in a simply - connected friedmann - lemaitre model containing the same number objects ( i.e. @xmath149 ) .",
    "@xmath131 is given as a function of @xmath150 , @xmath138 ( the number of sources in the fundamental domain ) and @xmath139 ( the number of copies of the domain within the observable universe ) by : @xmath151 } { ( b+1)^2a^2-(b+1)a-2}.\\ ] ] indeed , when working with a real catalog , we do not know the radial distance of cosmic objects but only their redshift . as seen before , the determination of the radial distance requires the knowledge of the cosmological parameters @xmath152 and @xmath153 and can be obtained analytically only when @xmath154 .",
    "thus , if the universe is multi - connected on sub  horizon scale , the plot of @xmath131 in terms of @xmath152 and @xmath155 will exhibit a spike only when the cosmological parameters have the right value ( as shown on plot 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "if the cosmological parameters are not exactly known , the distance determination ( [ chi1 ] ) will be wrong and the topological signature will be destroyed ( see figure 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "two consequences follow :    1 .   one should span the parameters space @xmath156 in order to detect the topological signal , plotting @xmath157 .",
    "if there is any topological signal , the position of the spike gives the values of the cosmological parameters on the scale of the catalog s limit ( see figure [ testr ] ) .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we first generate a catalog by choosing the number of objects in the fundamental domain ( @xmath158 ) , the topology ( weeks manifold ) and the cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xmath159 , @xmath160 ) , we then use a second code to apply the test and we draw @xmath131 in terms of the two cosmological parameters . as shown in @xcite , the method works pretty well in the sense that there is a strong spike which signals a non trivial topology and which determines the cosmological parameters .",
    "but we also see that a slight deviation in the evaluation of the cosmological parameters would make the spike to disappear .",
    "this effect is now discussed .",
    "when one wants to apply the ccp  method to real data , one has to face a number of problems .",
    "first , we can not use a zero width bin , one of the reasons being that the sources are not comoving . in @xcite",
    ", we estimate the precision needed on the cosmological parameters when working with a bin width @xmath136 such that @xmath161 indeed , using a catalog with a smaller depth @xmath162 will allow us to use a smaller resolution for the cosmological parameters .",
    "one has thus to find a compromise between depth and resolution as discussed in @xcite . on figure [ testr ] , we give an example with a bin width of @xmath163 which produces a background noise .",
    "now , we apply our test to the quasars catalog @xcite used ahead ( see figure [ catq ] ) .",
    "no topological signature was found @xcite .",
    "does it mean that there is no topological effect on scales smaller than @xmath164  ?",
    "not necessarily , since we applied the test with presicions @xmath165 and were unable to span the full cosmological parameters space with the required accuracy .",
    "the computational time is one of the main limitations of our technique ( this point is discussed extensively in @xcite )    now , another limitation comes from the peculiar velocities of the sources . in @xcite",
    ", we discussed in details the effect of peculiar velocities both on @xmath121pairs and on @xmath125pairs , we and showed that even if the amplitude of the topological signal is reduced , it is not destroyed .",
    "we have reviewed the main allowed topological structures for relativistic universe models and we discussed the various methods aimed to detect this topology . focusing on 3d - methods , we described the crystallographic method and we applied it to a quasars catalog to obtain a new constraint for euclidean manifolds , @xmath166 .",
    "then we discussed the failure of this method for detecting the topology of compact hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "we thus generalised the method by introducing a new technique based on the construction of a ccp  index .",
    "the main difference with the cosmic crystallography method is the collecting process of all correlated pairs of the catalog , which enhances the signal associated to the existence of a non trivial topology .",
    "we gave examples of computation of such an index in order to show its statistical relevance .",
    "we finally discussed the implementation difficulties of this new method when working with observational data .",
