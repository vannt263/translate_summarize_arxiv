    "is not completely settled @xcite .",
    "given a particular classical , many - body hamiltonian system , neither phenomenological nor fundamental transport theory can predict whether or not this specific hamiltonian system yields an energy transport governed by the fourier law @xmath0 , relating the macroscopic heat flux to the temperature gradient @xmath1 @xcite .    in spite of intense investigations in recent years , @xcite",
    "the precise conditions that a dynamical system of interacting particles must satisfy in order to obey the fourier law of heat conduction are still not known .",
    "however , the general picture that emerges is that , for systems with no globally conserved quantities ( i.e. , globally ergodic ) , positive lyapunov exponents is a sufficient condition to ensure the fourier heat law .    given the state of affairs , a common strategy is to investigate up to what extent one can simplify the microscopic dynamics and yet obtain a normal transport behavior .",
    "thermal transport has been studied for a lorentz channel a quasi - one - dimensional billiard with circular scatterers and it was shown to obey the fourier law @xcite , yet we do not have rigorous results and in spite of several efforts , the connection between lyapunov exponents , decay of correlations and diffusive and transport properties is still not completely clear . for example , in a recent paper @xcite , a model was presented which has zero lyapunov exponents , yet it exhibits unbounded gaussian diffusive behavior .",
    "since diffusive behavior is at the root of normal heat transport , the above result constitutes a strong suggestion that normal heat conduction can take place even without the strong requirement of exponential instability .",

    "@xcite and @xcite are noninteracting : thus , the condition of local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) is not satisfied .    at the quantum level , the question whether normal transport may arise from the underlying quantum dynamics remains an open issue @xcite .",
    "this is mostly because it is not clear how to describe the transport of energy or heat from a microscopic point of view . in analogy to classical systems , a quantum derivation of the fourier law calls directly in question the issue of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "however , a main feature of quantum motion is the lack of exponential dynamical instability @xcite .",
    "this fact may render very questionable the possibility to derive the fourier law of heat conduction in quantum mechanics .",
    "thus it is interesting to inquire if , and under what conditions , fourier law emerges from the laws of quantum mechanics ( for a recent review of the microscopic foundations of the quantum fourier law see @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we present a brief review of heat transport in classical and quantum systems .",
    "we then investigate the possibility to control the energy transport and discuss different microscopic mechanical models in which thermal rectification can be observed .",
    "the possibility of controlling heat conduction by nonlinearity opens the way to design a thermal rectifier , _",
    "i.e. _ , a system that carries heat preferentially in one direction while it behaves as an insulator in the opposite direction .",
    "to clarify the role of dynamical instability for the validity of fourier law , different microscopic mechanical models ( _ e.g. _ , chains of anharmonic oscillators and billiards ) have been investigated . here",
    "we focus on billiards with integrable or chaotic dynamics .    motivated by the ergodicity and mixing properties of the lorentz gas , in ref .",
    "@xcite a channel geometry has been considered to study the problem of heat conduction in this model .",
    "a lorentz gas consists of noninteracting point particles that collide elastically with a set of circular scatterers on the plane ( see fig .  [",

    ", it was found that in a lorentz channel the fourier law was satisfied , yet this system is not described by lte . a modification of this model in which particles and scatterers can exchange energy through their collisions appeared in ref .",
    "this effective interaction leads to the establishment of lte . as a consequence ,",
    "this model has proven to reproduce realistically macroscopic transport in many different situations @xcite .",
    "in particular , the validity of the fourier law was verified .",
    "one can conclude that , while the interaction among particles is not fundamental for the observation of normal transport , it is strictly necessary for the identification of microscopic dynamical quantities with the macroscopic physical parameters .",
    "more recently , in order to investigate if chaos is a necessary condition for the validity of fourier law , a two - dimensional billiard model - which consists of a rectangular area and a series of triangular scatterers- was considered ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : billiards]-@xmath3 ) .",
    "this model is analogous to the lorentz gas channel with triangles instead of discs , and the essential difference is that in the triangle billiard channel , the dynamical instability is linear ; therefore the lyapunov exponent is zero .",
    "strong numerical evidence has been recently given @xcite that the motion inside a triangle billiard , with all angles irrational with @xmath4 , is mixing , without any time scale , ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , an area - preserving map , which was derived as an approximation of the boundary map for the irrational triangle , shows a gaussian diffusive behavior when considered on the cylinder , even though the lyapunov exponent of the map is zero @xcite .",

    "heat baths have been simulated with stochastic kernels of gaussian type : namely , the probability distribution of velocities for particles coming out from the baths is @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . since the energy changes only at collisions with the heat baths ,",

    "the coefficient of thermal conductivity is , therefore , independent on @xmath9 , which means that the fourier law is obeyed . the same result is obtained using the green - kubo formalism @xcite .",

    "we have studied in @xcite and in @xcite the so - called _",
    "1d hard - point particles with alternating masses _ with and without total momentum conservation respectively .",
    "this model , consists of a one - dimensional chain of elastically colliding free particles with alternate masses @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "it shares with the triangle billiard the linear dynamical instability but in contrast , it is a genuinely interacting many - particle system .",
    "when the total momentum is conserved we have found that the heat current scales as @xmath32 with @xmath33 and thus , in contrast with the irrational triangle channel , the alternating mass model with conservation of total momentum does not obey the fourier law @xcite .",
    "we recall that in several recent papers @xcite it has been suggested that total momentum conservation does not allow fourier law and this may explain the lack of fourier law for the one dimensional alternating mass model .",
    "indeed , in @xcite we have found that the alternate mass hard - point gas without total momentum conservation obeys the fourier law .    in perspective , these results demonstrate that diffusive energy transport and fourier law can take place in marginally stable ( non - chaotic ) interacting many - particles systems . as a consequence , the exponential instability ( lyapunov chaos )",
    "is not necessary for the establishment of the fourier law .",
    "furthermore , our results show that breaking total momentum conservation is crucial for the validity of fourier law .      in the previous section",
