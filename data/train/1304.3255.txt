    "in last years the study of the properties of @xmath0 mesons and especially its weak decays attracts attention of both theorists and experimenters .",
    "indeed the investigation of such decays is important for the independent determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , studying the @xmath1-violation , testing the standard model and a `` new physics '' models .",
    "new precise data are coming from the experiments on large hadron collider ( lhc ) which significantly extended the number of the observed @xmath0 decay channels @xcite .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite we considered the weak @xmath0 decays to the ground and excited states of charmed mesons .",
    "such decays are the dominant decay channels of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "we calculated the weak decay form factors in the framework of the relativistic quark model with the qcd - motivated interquark potential .",
    "good agreement of our predictions for the semileptonic and nonleptonic decay branching fractions with experimental data has been found .",
    "here we extend our analysis to the consideration of the ckm suppressed @xmath0 decays to strange mesons .",
    "first we calculate the corresponding weak decay form factors .",
    "the characteristic features of the heavy - to - light @xmath2 transitions are the presence of the light @xmath3 meson in the final state and a very broad accessible kinematical region .",
    "therefore it is important to consistently take into account the relativistic effects , which give substantial contributions , and to reliably determine the momentum dependence of the form factors .",
    "it is necessary to point out that most of the available theoretical approaches permit to evaluate the form factors either at some fixed point ( of zero or maximum recoil of a final light meson ) or determine the momentum dependence of the form factors in a restricted kinematical range . as a result",
    "they require ad hoc assumptions about the @xmath4 dependence of form factors or their extrapolations , which also rely on specific models .",
    "the advantage of our model consists in its ability to explicitly determine the corresponding decay form factors as the overlap integrals of meson wave functions in the whole kinematical range without any additional assumptions and extrapolations .    in our calculations of the decay form factors we use the wave functions of the @xmath0 and @xmath3 mesons obtained previously in their mass spectra evaluations @xcite .",
    "in table  [ tab : smm ] we compare our predictions for the masses of the ground state and lowest orbitally excited strange mesons @xcite with available experimental data @xcite .",
    "we find satisfactory agreement of our predictions with data .",
    "note that in our mass spectrum calculations all relativistic effects , including the spin - dependent and spin - independent contributions to the potential , were treated nonperturbatively in @xmath5 . from table  [",
    "tab : smm ] we see that our model predicts that all orbitally excited @xmath6 mesons have masses heavier than 1  gev .",
    "the scalar @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) meson is predicted in our model to be a scalar tetraquark @xcite , while some other theoretical approaches assume it to be the scalar quark - antiquark ( @xmath9 ) state .",
    "it is clear that the form factors of the weak @xmath10 transition are significantly different if the @xmath11 meson is the @xmath9 or @xmath12 state .",
    "therefore the resulting rates of the semileptonic and nonleptonic @xmath0 decays to the @xmath11 strongly vary depending on its structure and quantum numbers .",
    "thus the study of the weak @xmath0 decays to the @xmath13 meson can help to reveal the nature of light scalar mesons . in the following",
    "we denote the @xmath11 meson by @xmath13 .",
    ".masses of the ground state and first orbitally excited strange mesons calculates in our model ( in mev ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the form factors of the @xmath0 weak decays to strange mesons were calculated in the framework of the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach .",
    "decays both to the ground @xmath14 and to orbitally excited @xmath6 mesons were considered .",
    "the form factors were determined as the overlap integrals of the related meson wave functions , found in the previous meson mass spectrum calculations @xcite , in the whole broad kinematical range without additional assumptions about their @xmath4 dependence .",
    "the important relativistic effects , such as transformations of the meson wave functions from the rest to a moving reference frame and contributions of the intermediate negative - energy states , were consistently taken into account .",
    "we used these form factors for the evaluation of the charmless semileptonic @xmath0 decay rates to ground state and orbitally excited @xmath3 mesons .",
    "it was found that total branching fractions of semileptonic @xmath0 decays to ground and first orbitally excited @xmath3 mesons have close values about @xmath15 .",
    "summing up these contributions we get @xmath16 .",
    "this value is almost 2 orders of magnitude lower than our prediction for the corresponding sum of branching fractions of the semileptonic @xmath0 to @xmath17 mesons @xcite as it was expected from the ratio of ckm matrix elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the total semileptonic @xmath0 decays branching fraction is dominated by the decays to @xmath17 mesons and in our model is equal to @xmath20 in good agreement with the experimental value @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the obtained predictions for charmless semileptonic @xmath0 decays were compared with previous calculations .",
    "it was found that different theoretical approaches yield close values of branching fractions for decays to ground state @xmath14 mesons agreeing within uncertainties , while the ones for the decays to orbitally excited @xmath6 mesons differ significantly from each other .",
    "the latter observation can help to discriminate between theoretical models .",
    "charmless two - body nonleptonic @xmath0 decays dominated by tree diagrams were considered .",
    "the factorization approximation was used which allowed to express the decay matrix elements as the product of weak transition matrix elements and decay constants .",
    "the branching fractions of the nonleptonic decays to ground state @xmath14 or orbitally excited @xmath6 meson and pion or @xmath22 meson , both charged and neutral , were calculated .",
    "the obtained results were confronted with previous theoretical predictions and experimental data , which are available for only few of the considered decays .",
    "good agreement with data and other evaluations is found for the nonleptonic decays to the ground state @xmath14 meson and a light meson , while again for decays involving the orbitally excited @xmath6 mesons significant disagreement between predictions of different approaches is observed .",
