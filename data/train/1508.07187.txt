    "it was the insight of anderson that disorder can substantially modify the dynamical behavior of quantum particles : the destructive quantum interference due to multiple scattering off impurities in the wire potentially brings the electrons to a halt , giving then rise to anderson localization @xcite .",
    "even when the consequences of disorder are less drastic , its interplay with quantum interference can still alter the mobility pattern , causing , e.g. ,  a transition from ballistic propagation to weak localization @xcite .",
    "while these interference effects already occur on the level of single disorder realizations , they even prevail under an average over many disorder realizations , this way stripping off individual peculiarities and defining a statistically robust effect .",
    "anderson localization , e.g. , unveils its characteristic trait , exponential wave function tails , on the level of the ensemble average .",
    "the possibility to implement disorder models with highly - controllable cold atomic gases has brought it into reach to access disorder phenomena and their underlying quantum origin even on the level of the spatially resolved atomic density @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it was , for instance , observed that the ensemble - averaged correlation function of density fluctuations exhibits , at long times , characteristic long - range correlations , which can be traced back to the macroscopic coherence in the gas @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the evolution of quantum coherence under the disorder average at _ short times_. we find that the spatial pattern of the coherence loss of the ensemble - averaged state is directly related to the correlations in the disorder potential .",
    "this loss already happens at ballistic times much shorter than the mean free time @xmath1 , where the disorder does not yet have a significant effect on the level of single realizations .",
    "we emphasize that this effective decoherence of the ensemble average state does not correspond to a loss of information as it generally occurs in the presence of an environment .",
    "in our case , single disorder realizations follow the unitary dynamics of isolated quantum systems , i.e.  the occurrence of quantum interference phenomena which survive the ensemble average , such as anderson or weak localization , remains untouched .",
    "the coherent nature of the dynamics of single realizations can for instance be recovered by considering higher - order correlators , such as , e.g. , intensity correlations .",
    "the loss of coherence of the ensemble - averaged state , on the other hand , is a consequence of the fact that different disorder realizations propagate an initially pure state into different evolved states , and that their averaging generally results in a mixed state .    to establish our results ,",
    "we derive a general lindblad master equation for the evolution of the disorder - averaged state on short time scales , allowing us to investigate the transient dynamics for arbitrary initial states @xmath2 . in this approach , the dynamical impact of the disorder",
    "is reflected by the structure of the resulting master equation . in particular , coherent and incoherent contributions to the dynamics of the ensemble - averaged state are consistently separated . as we show , the evolution generated by the master equation for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) anderson model perfectly agrees with the short - time dynamics of numerically exact simulations thereof .",
    "let us stress that our approach lies at the interface between quantum transport theory of disordered systems and the theory of open systems .",
    "it complements other perturbative methods to treat disorder dynamics , e.g. based on averaged propagators and/or diagrammatic methods @xcite .",
    "alternative evolution equations for the ensemble average state have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive understanding of the disorder - induced dynamics at short times is also of practical relevance , as it permits one to access the detrimental impact of perturbations on the functioning of quantum devices . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a simple example , the double - slit experiment .",
    "there , the observed fringe pattern , which represents the purpose of the device , strongly relies on the delicate interplay between the delocalized state prepared by the slits and the phases accumulated on the way to the screen .",
    "what happens if the particles are disturbed along their way , e.g.  if they propagate across a disordered scattering potential towards the screen ? as we show in fig .  1",
    ", averaging over many realizations of the disorder potential gives rise to a continuous - in - time decay of coherences , i.e.  the visibility of the interference pattern in momentum is monotonously reduced as time elapses . in other words , while single realizations exhibit distorted interference fringes , the ensemble average recovers the structure of the undisturbed pattern , however with an increasingly reduced visibility .",

    "we emphasize that the disorder master equation ( [ eq : short - time_master_equation ] ) still holds for arbitrary systems and general disorder distributions , since we have not yet made use of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : anderson_model_hamiltonian ] ) and/or of the homogeneous distribution ( [ eq : translational - invariant_distribution ] ) . in the appendix",

    "one finds that the short - time dynamics of the ensemble - averaged state are governed by the well - known caldeira - leggett master equation @xcite .    in the case of the disorder model ( [ eq : anderson_model_hamiltonian ] ) , the average hamiltonian is given by the discrete hopping term , @xmath43 ( we used ( [ eq : vanishing_expectation_values ] ) ) , and the lindblad operators are given by the disorder potentials , @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 ) .",

    "we derive an alternative representation for homogeneous disorder models ( [ eq : translational - invariant_distribution ] ) which resolves these issues and , in addition , reveals a connection to collisional decoherence .",
    "to obtain an alternative representation for the short - time dynamics ( [ eq : short - time_master_equation ] ) of the homogeneous disorder models ( [ eq : translational - invariant_distribution ] ) , we exploit that lindblad master equations are invariant w.r.t  unitary transformations of the lindblad operators . in our case",

    "it represents the simplest manifestation of a translational - covariant lindblad master equation @xcite .",
    "the master equation ( [ eq : collisional_decoherence_equation ] ) allows us to deduce the decoherence dynamics of the homogeneous disorder models ( [ eq : translational - invariant_distribution ] ) .",
    "one can best understand the spatial decoherence behavior of ( [ eq : collisional_decoherence_equation ] ) by neglecting the coherent dynamics according to the von neumann commutator and solving the remaining equation in the position representation .",

    "this again reflects the fact that the disorder , i.e.  the deviations among different ensemble members , gives rise to the decoherence - like behavior .    in the case of the 1d anderson model with the correlation function ( [ eq : anderson_correlation_function ] )",
    ", one obtains a constant momentum transfer distribution , @xmath58 , and the localization function reads @xmath59 , i.e. , while the populations remain unaffected , all spatial coherences undergo the same decay , independent of the separation of the two respective sites , since the sites are uncorrelated .    as a second example we consider a gaussian random potential with the correlation function @xmath60 , where @xmath61 denotes the correlation strength and @xmath62 the correlation length .",
    "such correlations may , for example , emerge from a collection of gaussian scattering potentials @xmath63 with randomly distributed scattering centers @xmath64 .",

    "in order to estimate the range of validity @xmath70 of the short - time disorder master equation ( [ eq : collisional_decoherence_equation ] ) , we compare it in case of the 1d anderson model to the numerical ensemble average over a finite sample of disorder realizations . in fig .",

    "these must then emerge as a feature of the , in general , incoherent evolution of the ensemble - averaged state .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : master_equation_comparison](d ) illustrates the monotonic decay of the averaged state s purity towards that of the ( localized ) asymptotic state .",
    "the asymptotic value of the purity decreases with increasing disorder strength @xmath22 , which reflects that the remaining coherence in the asymptotic state is related to the localization length @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "our results represent a first step towards a treatment of disordered quantum systems in terms of quantum master equations .",
    "the impact of spectral and of unitarily invariant disorder on the dynamics of the ensemble - averaged state of finite - dimensional quantum systems at arbitrary times @xmath96 is the subject of @xcite .",

    "in the following we evaluate the short - time disorder dynamics ( [ eq : short - time_master_equation ] ) for two simple , yet relevant examples : a particle of mass @xmath42 in one - dimensional , continuous space , subject to a random i ) linear or ii ) harmonic potential .",
    "we consider a hamiltonian of the form @xmath97 , i.e.  the randomness lies in the strength of the constant force exerted on the particle .",
    "this describes for example experiments where a charged particle is exposed to a homogeneous , but not fully controlled electric field , i.e.  the field strength varies from run to run .",
    "if we assume for simplicity that @xmath98 , the average hamiltonian corresponds to the free hamiltonian , @xmath99 , and for the lindblad operators we obtain @xmath100 , with @xmath40 an arbitrary energy scale ( which is again introduced for dimensional reasons and irrelevant for the final result ( [ eq : caldeira - leggett_equation ] ) ) . since all lindblad operators are proportional to @xmath101 , we can perform the disorder integral in ( [ eq : short - time_master_equation ] ) and obtain the simplified master equation @xmath102 - \\frac{\\overline{\\varepsilon^2}}{\\hbar^2 } t \\ , [ \\hat{x } , [ \\hat{x } , \\overline{\\rho } ] ] .\\ ] ] this is the well - known caldeira - leggett master equation @xcite , which usually emerges in an open - system context from a linear coupling model .",
    "the incoherent part of ( [ eq : caldeira - leggett_equation ] ) predicts an exponential decay of spatial coherences according to ( as for the derivation of the collisional decoherence localization function ( [ eq : localization_function ] ) , we neglect for the moment the von neumann commutator ) @xmath103 \\rho_0(x , x')$ ] .",
    "while such a localization rate which grows above all bounds for @xmath104 is usually considered as unphysical in the open - system context , it arises here as a natural and unavoidable consequence of the disorder average .",
    "we could in principle allow for both a random frequency and a random center point .",
    "we focus here on the latter and keep the frequency fixed , @xmath105 .",
    "this may describe experiments where a particle is harmonically trapped , but where the trap center is subject to fluctuations . in this case",
    "( again assuming that @xmath98 ) , the short - time dynamics ( [ eq : short - time_master_equation ] ) result , once again , in caldeira - leggett decoherence , @xmath106 - m \\omega^2 ( \\overline{\\varepsilon^2}/\\hbar^2 ) t [ \\hat{x } , [ \\hat{x } , \\overline{\\rho}]]$ ] , but this time with a harmonic average potential @xmath107 . in this example , we can even anticipate the evolution of the ensemble average beyond the short - time approximation : since all random potentials share the same frequency @xmath108 , any initial state will at multiples of the period @xmath109 recur , and in particular it will regain the purity lost in the early stage . on the level of the disorder master equation ,",
    "this indicates periodic , partly negative decoherence rates @xmath110 .",
    "while such time dependence comprising ( at least partial ) purity revivals is likely the generic pattern of the ensemble average dynamics , fig .",
