    "qcd studies always have to consider how the observed final states consisting of hadrons , e.g. from the process @xmath5 hadrons , map on qcd predictions in terms of partons , the quarks and gluons .",
    "the transition from the partons of the hard process to the observed hadrons , commonly referred to as hadronisation , is a fundamental property of qcd .",
    "however , there is no fundamental qcd based theory of the transition from partons to hadrons .",
    "the most successful description of the hadronisation process in @xmath0  annhilation has been achieved with monte carlo simulations based on a parton shower followed by formation of hadrons .",
    "recently , analytic models of the hadronisation have become available which predict how hadronisation effects of qcd observables , e.g. event shapes , scale as a power of the energy scale of the hard process .",
    "these models are often referred to as power corrections .",
    "in this report we will briefly review some of the analytic models and present comparisons with @xmath0  annihilation data .",
    "we will also show a more general test of the consistency of power corrections with the gauge structure of qcd .",
    "we summarise three related approaches to predict the power correction of event shape observables . in all cases",
    "the form of the dependence on the scale of the hard process is extracted from an analysis of infrared renormalon singularities .",
    "the differences between the approaches come from the regularisation of the infrared singularities in order to obtain meaningful predictions .",
    "the model of dokshitzer , marchesini and webber ( dmw )  @xcite makes the assumption that evolution of @xmath6  to energies below the landau pole is possible but the form of @xmath7  is a priori unknown .",
    "a non - perturbative parameter @xmath8  is introduced as the 0th moment over @xmath7 : @xmath9 the quantity @xmath10  is the infrared matching scale where the non - perturbative and perturbative evolution of @xmath6  are merged , usually @xmath11  gev .    for some event shape observables the power corrections have been calculated up to two loops  @xcite .",
    "the result is that hadronisation is described by a shift of the perturbative prediction @xmath12 inversely proportional to the hard scale @xmath13 : @xmath14 the factor @xmath15 is universal  @xcite and includes two loop corrections in the quantity",
    "@xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath17 contains all dependencies on the specific event shape observable in question .",
    "the prediction for the 1st moment from equation ( [ equ_dmw ] ) is @xmath18 .",
    "we note that the dmw model predicts that @xmath8  does not depend on the observable .",
    "this property of universality can be tested experimentally .",
    "a theoretical analysis of power corrections of the 1st and higher moments of the thrust distribution was presented in  @xcite . a different approach compared to the dmw model",
    "is taken by adding a resummation based on the so - called single dressed gluon approximation ( sdg ) to the standard perturbative qcd predictions in @xmath4 .",
    "the sdg regularises the infrared renormalon singularities .    for the first moment of thrust",
    "a power correction proportional to @xmath19 is found , in agreement with the dmw model .",
    "the additional resummation leads to a substantial reduction in the relative magnitude of the power correction .",
    "it should be noted that power corrections calculated in this approach can not be directly compared to the dmw model  @xcite .    for the 2nd and 3rd moment of thrust the power corrections",
    "are predicted to be of the form @xmath20 .",
    "however , other terms of the form @xmath21 and @xmath22 are also predicted to exist but can not be quantified .",
    "this approach is based on factorisation of soft and hard processes in event shape distributions  @xcite .",
    "the ansatz is a convolution of the resummed perturbative qcd calculation ( @xmath4+nlla ) @xmath23 for the hard process with a so - called shape function @xmath24 for the non - pertubative or soft processes .",
    "a factorisation scale @xmath25 separates contributions from gluons with @xmath26 taken account of by @xmath24 from those with @xmath27 included in @xmath23 . for a cumulative event shape distribution @xmath28 at cms energy @xmath29",
    "one has : @xmath30 it is shown that the shape function @xmath24 resums all power corrections of the form @xmath31 and that it is related to the energy flow in the event .",
    "the description of non - perturbative effects by a shift @xmath32 of the perturbative qcd prediction in the dmw model is reproduced as the special case where @xmath24 is a delta function .",
    "for the 2nd moments of thrust , heavy jet mass and c - parameter a prediction for the power correction of the form @xmath33 is given , consistent with section  [ sec_gardi ] .",
    "comparison of the predictions with distributions , 1st and 2nd moments of thrust , heavy jet mass and c - parameter from 35  gev to 189  gev shows reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "all experimental analyses study power corrections in the dmw model . for moments",
    "the perturbative qcd prediction is @xmath4  while for distributions the power correction terms are combined with @xmath4+nlla calculations .",
    "studies of power corrections using the 1st moments of the event shape observables thrust , heavy jet mass , total and wide jet broadening and c - parameter have been performed by several collaborations .",
    "the lep experiments aleph  @xcite , delphi  @xcite and l3  @xcite used data recorded at cms energies up to 205  gev while the reanalysis of data from the petra experiment jade covers in addition the range 35  gev to 44  gev  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_delphi ] presents the delphi high energy data together with data from other experiments at @xmath34 .",
    "the fit of the @xmath4perturbative qcd prediction combined with a power correction describes the data well .",
    "figure  [ fig_l3 ] shows the results by l3 for 2nd moments from analyses of the lep  2 high energy data as well as from low energy data obtained by selecting events at @xmath35 with hard initial or final state photon radiation .",
    "the fits of the energy evolution of the 2nd moments are based on a simple extension of the dmw model with @xmath36 .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is fitted with @xmath6  and @xmath8  fixed to the results from fits to 1st moments and it is found to be consistent with zero only for heavy jet mass and the wide jet broadening .          in the dmw model power corrections to differential event shape distributions are described by a shift @xmath38 of the perturbative prediction",
    ". this prediction has been tested with reanalysed jade data together with data from sld and the lep experiments  @xcite and also with lep data by aleph  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_jade ] presents distributions of the c - parameter from @xmath39  gev to 183  gev with a fit of the dmw prediction  @xcite .",
    "the fitted prediction within the fit ranges indicated by solid lines describes the data well within the errors .",
    "in this analysis fits of the dmw model to event shape distributions as shown in section  [ sec_dsdy ] are generalised to vary one of the qcd colour factors @xmath1 , @xmath2  or @xmath3  along with @xmath6  and @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "sensitivity to the colour factors comes mainly from the running of @xmath6  in the perturbative prediction .",
    "potential biases from assuming standard qcd in the hadronisation corrections should not be present .",
    "it is observed that fits to thrust and c - parameter are stable while fits to total and wide jet broadening do nt converge well in all cases .",
    "results of the fits to individual colour factors , @xmath6  and @xmath8  are shown in figure  [ fig_colrun ] and are consistent with standard qcd based on the su(3 ) symmetry group .",
    "the total uncertainties on the measurements of the colour factors are competitive with traditional analyses using 4-jet final states at @xmath35 .    , @xmath8  and the qcd colour factors from fits to event shape distributions  @xcite .",
    "a summary of all results for @xmath40  and @xmath8  of analyses based on the dmw model is shown in figure  [ fig_summ ] .",
    "the label ppstl refers to the analyses of data from pep , petra , slc , tristan and lep performed together with reanalysed jade data  @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath40  are consistent with the current world average @xmath41  @xcite while the results for @xmath8mostly cluster within @xmath42 . the results for @xmath8  support the prediction of universality within 25% .    and @xmath8  from analyses of the dmw power correction model",
    "]    the other power corrections models are promising new approaches and need experimental testing . from an experimental point of view",
    "it would also be desirable to quantify the relations between the different models .",
    "the study of qcd colour factors within the dmw model yields results consistent with standard su(3 ) qcd with thrust and c - parameter .",
    "the total uncertainties on the colour factors are competitive with other measurements of the colour factors",
    ".    the field of power corrections in @xmath0  annihilation is rapidly developing and it gives one the opportunity to learn more about soft qcd and the physics of hadronisation .",
