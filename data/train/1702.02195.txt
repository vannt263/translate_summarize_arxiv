    "magnetic chemically peculiar ( mcp ) stars are the most suitable test beds for studying rotation and its variation in upper ( b2v to f6v ) main - sequence stars .",
    "the surface chemical composition of mcps is very uneven .",
    "overabundant elements are , as a rule , concentrated into large spots persisting for decades to centuries .",
    "the abundance inhomogeneities on the stellar surface influence the star s spectral energy distribution .",
    "as the star rotates , periodic variations in the brightness , spectrum , and magnetic field are observed .",
    "we have studied both present and archival observations of all kinds to check the stability of mcp star rotation periods with impressive accuracy .",
    "the changes in the periods were derived from shifts of ( light , spectroscopic ) phase curves obtained in the past .",
    "@xcite developed this method and applied it to helium strong v901ori .",
    "then it was many times improved and tested on mcps and other types of variables ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the method is based on the usage of suitable phenomenological models of phase curves and the period variation .",
    "solution through robust regression provides us with all model parameters and estimations of their uncertainty .    the vast majority of cp stars studied to date display strictly periodic variations .",
    "however , a few mcp stars , including cuvir  and v901ori , have been discovered to exhibit rotational period variations .",
    "cu vir = hd 124224 , is a bright , rapidly - rotating ( @xmath0d ) , medium - aged silicon mcp star @xcite .",
    "it is also the first known hot stellar radio pulsar ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite , using their new and archival photometry , constructed an o - c diagram showing a sudden period increase of 2.6 s ( slower rotation ) in 1984 !",
    "another smaller jump toward a longer period in 1998 was reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite processed all available measurements of cuvir  and found that its rotation was gradually slowing until 2005 and since then has been accelerating .",
    "d. the period variations are approximated by a sinusoid reaching its extrema in 1970 and 2003 .",
    "the amplitude of period variations is 3.78s .",
    "( b ) o - c@xmath1 variations versus the linear ephemeris at the time @xmath2 have semiamplitude @xmath3d@xmath4.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    we have collected 18617 new and archival measurements of cuvir  covering 67 years , including photometry in the wavelength range 200 - 753 nm , spectroscopy , radiometry , and magnetic field measurements .",
    "the period variations appear to be cyclic and may be periodic ( see fig.[duocu ] ) .",
    "we derive a cycle timescale of @xmath5yr .",
    "@xcite show that such period oscillations might result from the interaction of the internal magnetic field and differential rotation and predict a rotational cycle timescale of 51yr .",
    "v901ori= hd 37776 is a very young hot star ( b2iv ) with a complex global magnetic field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is listed among he - strong cp stars , although its light variations are caused by the incidence of spectroscopic spots with an overabundance of silicon @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported possible gradual changes in the stellar rotation .",
    "this suspicion was confirmed by @xcite who found that the rotational deceleration was recently replaced by acceleration .",
    "analysing all available data , we conclude that the maximum period @xmath6 occurred in 2007.7(1.3 ) , when the second derivative of the period @xmath7d@xmath8 . if the observed o - c variation is a segment of cyclic changes , then the duration of the cycle should be longer than 120 years .",
    "currently , we are not able to explain this type of the rotational variability ; even the new mechanism described in @xcite predicts an unacceptably short cycle for v901  ori .",
    "@xmath9orie = hd 37479 = v1030 ori is a hybrid of a classical he - strong mcp star and a be star with strong stellar winds .",
    "it is an extremely young and massive star with a period of photometric and spectral changes @xmath10d .",
    "@xcite revealed the period to be increasing at the rate @xmath11syr@xmath8 .",
    "the spin - down time @xcite @xmath12years is compatible with the age of the star .",
    "consequently , the observed lengthening of the period can be explained by magnetic braking through strong stellar winds @xcite .",
    "bscir= hd 125630 is a relatively old ( @xmath13myr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) srcreu mcp star with strong antiphase light variations in @xmath14 and @xmath15 colors @xcite . @xcite revealed that the rotational period of @xmath16d is increasing at the rate @xmath17 syr@xmath8 .",
    "the spin - down time @xmath18years represents only @xmath19 of the estimated age of the star .",
    "total variations in o - c are smaller than @xmath20 , so they might be caused by stellar precession ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we conclude that the rotational periods of a few mcp stars are gradually changing . however , the stars exhibiting these variations differ in almost all relevant aspects .",
    "it is very likely the period variations have more than one cause .    single star evolution with standard stellar winds results in rotation changes too slow to detect .",
    "the light - time effect leads to radial velocity variations , but these are not detected .",
    "magnetic braking through the angular momentum loss caused by the wind escaping from the extended magnetosphere can apparently be effective only in very specific cases of hot mcps as @xmath9orie .",
    "the precession of a magnetically distorted star might be taken into our account for bscir which has small - amplitude period changes .",
    "period oscillations in cuvir  can be interpreted as a consequence of torsional waves that may disseminate within this magnetic rotating star @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a plausible explanation for the rotational period variations in v901ori  remains elusive .",
