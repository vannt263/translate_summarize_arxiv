    "a key question in modern nuclear physics is the knowledge of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) and , in particular , of its dependence on density and on asymmetry , i.e. , on the relative neutron - to - proton abundance .",
    "the eos can be divided into a symmetric term ( i.e. , independent of the isospin asymmetry i=@xmath1 , where n and z are the numbers of neutrons and protons , respectively ) and an asymmetric term given by the symmetry energy , i.e. the difference between the eos for neutron matter and for symmetric one , multiplied by the square of the isospin asymmetry i  @xcite .",
    "+ measurements of isoscalar collective vibrations , collective flow and kaon production  @xcite in energetic nucleus - nucleus collisions have constrained the behavior of the eos of isospin symmetric matter for densities up to five times the saturation density @xmath2 . on the other side ,",
    "the eos of asymmetric matter is still subject to large uncertainties .",
    "besides the astrophysical interest , e.g. neutron star physics and supernovae dynamics  @xcite , the density dependence of the symmetry energy is of fundamental importance for nuclear physics .",
    "the thickness of the neutron skin of heavy nuclei reflects the differential pressure exerted on the core  @xcite and the strength of the three - body forces , an important ingredient in nuclear structure calculations  @xcite , represents one of the major uncertainties in modeling the eos at high density  @xcite .",
    "moreover , properties of nuclei away from the valley of stability and the dynamics of nuclear reactions at fermi energies rely on the density dependence of the symmetry energy  @xcite . + in the last decade , measurements of the giant monopole  @xcite , giant dipole  @xcite and pygmy dipole  @xcite resonances in neutron - rich nuclei , isospin diffusion  @xcite , neutron and proton emissions  @xcite , fragment isotopic ratios  @xcite , isospin dependence of competition between deep - inelastic and incomplete fusion reactions  @xcite , neutron enrichment of mid - velocity fragments  @xcite have provided constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy around and below saturation density @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it results that the best description of experimental data is obtained with a symmetry energy @xmath3 with @xmath4 in the range 0.6 - 1.1 ( @xmath5 is the reduced nuclear density ) . in the near future",
    ", extensions of these measurements with both stable and rare - isotope beams will provide further stringent constraints at sub - saturation densities .",
    "+ in contrast , up to now , very few experimental constraints exist on the symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this is the domain with the greatest theoretical uncertainty and the largest interest for neutron stars .",
    "the behavior of the asymmetric eos at supra - saturation densities can only be explored in terrestrial laboratories by using relativistic heavy - ion collisions of isospin asymmetric nuclei .",
    "reaction simulations propose several potentially useful observable such as neutron and proton flows ( direct and elliptic )  @xcite , neutron / proton ratio  @xcite , @xmath7 ratio and flows  @xcite , @xmath8  @xcite and @xmath9/@xmath10  @xcite ratios , flow and yield of light charged particles , with special emphasis on isotope pairs ( e.g. @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 )  @xcite . to this day",
    "the problem is still open , since few studies have provided constraints on the behavior of the symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "+ the single ratio @xmath7 was measured in @xmath15  @xcite and analyzed using the hadronic transport model ibuu04  @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that the symmetry energy is rather soft at supra - saturation densities ; this finding - symmetry energy reaches its maximum at a density between @xmath2 and @xmath16 and then starts decreasing at higher densities - is not consistent with most of the extrapolation near or below saturation density .",
    "the same set of fopi data has been analyzed in the framework of the improved isospin dependent quantum molecular dynamics ( imiqmd )  @xcite ; it results in a very stiff symmetry energy of the potential term proportional to @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , work  @xcite suggests a reduced sensitivity of the @xmath7 ratio to the symmetry energy .",
    "it follows that for the pion signal further work is needed to establish the effectiveness in probing the symmetry energy . in - medium absorption and re - emission of pions",
    "can distort the asymptotic experimental signal and it is not clear which density of matter is explored by the pions signal .",
    "the analysis of another set of fopi data is described in the next section of this paper .",
    "+ in addition , we want to remind the reader that the fopi collaboration has recently published a complete systematic of direct and elliptic flows for light charged particles ( lcp ) for 25 combinations of systems and energies  @xcite , that represents an unique set of data to study symmetry energy effects in flow and yield of lcp .",
    "one of the most promising probe of the symmetry energy strength at supra - saturation densities is the difference of the neutron and proton ( or hydrogen ) elliptic flows  @xcite .",
    "this has emerged firstly from calculations based on the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( urqmd )  @xcite .",
    "we report here some results obtained using urqmd for the @xmath15 collision at 400 mev / nucleon .",
    "the calculations have been performed using both asy - stiff @xmath19 and asy - soft @xmath20 potential symmetry energies .",
    "the urqmd predictions for the elliptic flow of neutrons , protons and hydrogen as a function of rapidity in the laboratory frame , @xmath21 , for mid - peripheral collisions ( impact parameter @xmath22 fm ) and for the two choices of the density dependence of the symmetry energy , are shown in fig . 1 .     for mid - peripheral ( impact parameter @xmath22 fm ) @xmath15 collisions at 400 mev / nucleon as calculated with the urqmd model for neutrons ( dots ) , protons ( circles ) , and all hydrogen isotopes ( z=1 , open triangles ) , integrated over transverse momentum @xmath23 , as a function of the laboratory rapidity @xmath21 .",

    "@xcite for z = 1 particles at mid - rapidity is represented by the filled triangle ( the horizontal bar represents the experimental rapidity interval ) ; from  @xcite . ]",
    "we remind here that direct ( @xmath24 ) and elliptic ( @xmath25 ) flows are obtained by the azimuthal particle distributions with the usual fourier expansion @xmath26 with @xmath27 representing the azimuthal angle of the emitted particle with respect to the reaction plane  @xcite . the dominant difference is",
    "the significantly larger neutron squeeze - out in the asy - stiff case ( upper panel ) compared to the asy - soft case ( lower panel ) .",
    "neutron and proton directed and elliptic flows were measured in @xmath15 collisions at 400 mev / nucleon using the land neutron detector and the fopi phase 1 forward wall  @xcite .",
    "we have reanalyzed the data to extract the neutron and proton direct and elliptic flows  @xcite .",
    "the results have been compared with predictions of the urqmd model with the aim of providing constraints on the symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities .",
    "the dependence of the elliptic flow parameter @xmath25 on the transverse momentum per nucleon , @xmath28 , is shown in fig .",
    "2 , upper panel , for the combined data set of collisions with impact parameter @xmath29 fm ; the impact parameter has been estimated from the total charged particle multiplicity registered in the fopi forward wall .     for neutrons ( dots ) and hydrogen isotopes ( open triangles , top panel ) and their ratio ( lower panels ) for moderately central ( @xmath30 ) collisions of @xmath15 at 400 mev / nucleon , as a function of the transverse momentum per nucleon @xmath28 .",
    "the symbols represent the experimental data .",
    "the urqmd predictions for @xmath31 = 1.5 ( asy - stiff ) and @xmath31= 0.5 ( asy - soft ) obtained for neutrons ( top panel ) and for the ratio ( bottom panel ) are given by the dashed lines ; adapted from  @xcite . ]    for the quantitative evaluation , the ratio of the flow parameters of neutrons versus hydrogen isotopes has been used .",
    "the results for the ratio @xmath32 , i.e. with respect to the integrated hydrogen yield , are shown in fig . 2 ( lower panel ) . the experimental ratios ,",
    "even though evaluated with large errors , are found to scatter within the intervals given by the calculations for @xmath31 = 0.5 and 1.5 .",
    "linear interpolations between the predictions , averaged over @xmath33 gev / c , yield @xmath34 for the exponent describing the density dependence of the potential term .",
    "the same analysis has been also performed for a different parameterization of the momentum dependence of the elastic in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross section  @xcite , for the @xmath25 ratios of free neutrons with respect to free protons , and for different bins of impact parameter , resulting in a preliminary value of @xmath35 . however , due to the limited statistic , a more accurate extrapolation of the symmetry energy is not possible .",
    "+ in an independent analysis , cozma used data from the same experiment and investigated the influence of several parameters on the difference between the elliptic flows of protons and neutrons using the tbingen version of the qmd transport model  @xcite .",
    "they included the parametrization of the isoscalar eos , the choice of various forms of free or in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross sections , and model parameters as , e.g. , the widths of the wave packets representing nucleons .",
    "the interaction used by cozma contains an explicit momentum dependence of the symmetry energy part .",
    "both the difference and the ratio of neutron and proton elliptic flows are found to be sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy ; comparing the predictions to the fopi / land data in  @xcite , the best description is obtained with a density dependence dependence slightly stiffer than the @xmath36 case ; it is thus rather close to the urqmd result @xmath37 which may represent an important step towards the model invariance with respect to different treatment of the nucleon - nucleon cross sections used in the two studies and to the explicit momentum dependence of the isovector potentials which is implemented in the tbingen qmd but not in the urqmd version .",
    "+ however , it is obvious that data with higher statistical precision are highly desirable , since it allows following the evolutions of isospin signals with impact parameter , transverse momentum and particle type more accurately",
    ". moreover better data would be important to study isospin effects on the momentum dependence of the in - medium interactions @xcite .",
    "in may 2011 the data taking of experiment s394 at gsi has been completed .",
    "the symmetric collision systems @xmath15 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 at 400 mev / nucleon incident energies have been measured . with the new experiment , an attempt is being made to considerably improve the previous set of data , by improving the statistical accuracy of the measured flow parameters for au+au reactions , and to extend the flow measurements to other systems .",
    "indeed the study of isospin effects can be improved using new observable like the one related to light fragments up to atomic number z=4 , with special emphasis on the light isobar pairs @xmath40 and @xmath41 . + a schematic view and a photo of experimental set - up are shown in fig .",
    "the beam was guided in vacuum to about 2 m upstream from the target .",
    "a thin plastic foil read by two photo - multipliers was used to tag in time the beam arrival and acted as a start detector for the time - of - flight measurement .",
    "+ the large area neutron detector ( land ) @xcite , recently upgraded with new tacquila gsi - asic electronics , was positioned at laboratory angles around 45@xmath42 with respect to the beam direction , at a distance of about 5 m from the target .",
    "a veto - wall of plastic scintillators in front of land allows discrimination of neutrons and charged particles .",
    "in such a way it is possible to measure the direct and elliptic collective flows of neutrons and hydrogens at mid - rapidity with high precision in the same angular acceptance .",
    "+ in addition , krakow triple telescope array , kratta @xcite , has been built to measure the energy , emission angles and isotopic composition of light charged reaction products .",
    "it performed very well during the experiment .",
    "the 35 modules of kratta , arranged in a 7x5 array , were placed opposite to land at the distance of 40 cm from the target , and covered 160 @xmath43 of the solid angle , at polar angles between 20@xmath42 and 64@xmath42 .",
    "the modules of kratta , shown in panel a ) of fig . 3 consisted of two , optically decoupled , csi(tl ) crystals ( thickness of 2.5 and 12.5 @xmath44 ) and three large area , 500 @xmath45 m thick , pin photo - diodes .",
    "the first photo - diode served as a si @xmath46e detector and supplied the ionization signal alone .",
    "the second one worked in a `` single chip telescope '' configuration and provided both the ionization signal and the light output from the thin crystal .",
    "the third photo - diode read out the light from the thick crystal .",
    "the signals from the photo - diodes were integrated by custom - made low - noise charge preamplifiers and digitized with 100 mhz , caen v1724 digitizers .",
    "very good isotopic resolution has been obtained in the whole dynamic range ( see @xcite ) . as an example panel b ) of fig .",
    "4 shows a @xmath46e - e scatter plot from the kratta detector ; an isotopic resolution up to z=6 is clearly visible .",
    "+ the determination of the impact parameter and the orientation of the reaction plane required the use of several devices : + i ) the aladin time - of - flight wall @xcite was used to detect forward emitted charged particles at polar angles smaller than 7@xmath42 ; two walls ( front and rear ) of 2.5 * 100 @xmath47 plastic scintillators , read by two photo - multipliers at both ends , gave information on emission angle , atomic number and velocity of ions .",

    "<S> the elliptic - flow ratio of neutrons with respect to protons in reactions of neutron rich heavy - ions systems at intermediate energies has been proposed as an observable sensitive to the strength of the symmetry term in the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) at supra - saturation densities . </S>",
    "<S> the recent results obtained from the existing fopi / land data for @xmath0au+@xmath0au collisions at 400 mev / nucleon in comparison with the urqmd model allowed a first estimate of the symmetry term of the eos but suffer from a considerable statistical uncertainty . in order to obtain an improved data set for au+au collisions and to extend the study to other systems , </S>",
    "<S> a new experiment was carried out at the gsi laboratory by the asy - eos collaboration in may 2011 . </S>"
