    "ba@xmath0ados , silk , and west ( bsw ) pointed out that the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of two colliding particles can be arbitrarily large , if the collision occurs near the event horizon of an extremal kerr black hole and the angular momentum of either of the colliding particles is finetuned to the critical value  @xcite .",
    "this is now called the bsw effect . see harada and kimura  @xcite for a brief review and references therein for further details .",
    "particle collision with high cm energy had already been noticed by piran , shaham , and katz in the study of energy extraction from collisional events in the ergoregion , which is called collisional penrose process  @xcite .",
    "this process is typically as follows .",
    "we consider the reaction of particles 1 and 2 into particles 3 and 4 in the ergoregion , where particle 3 escapes to the infinity after the collision , while particle 4 falls into the black hole possibly with negative energy due to the existence of the ergosphere .",
    "if one defines an energy - extraction efficiency as @xmath3 the energy extraction ( @xmath4 ) from the black hole is possible provided @xmath5",
    ".    the high - cm - energy collision can produce a very massive and/or energetic particle .",
    "this means that kerr black holes act as natural particle accelerators , which can accelerate even neutral particles .",
    "recently , the interplay between such particle acceleration and energy extraction have been intensively investigated  @xcite . in particular",
    ", schnittman @xcite numerically showed that the upper limit of energy - extraction efficiency in the collisional penrose process can reach about 13.9 .",
    "berti , brito , and cardoso confirmed the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , and also showed that an arbitrarily high efficiency is possible by more general processes .",
    "namely , they considered a head - on collision of two subcritical particles , which is called super - penrose process .",
    "this process needs an outgoing particle which must be generated in the ergoregion by some preceding process  @xcite .    in this paper , we study particle collision near the horizon of an extremal kerr black hole and the resultant energy extraction .",
    "we present an analytic formulation to investigate collisional penrose process under the assumption that particles follow geodesics in the equatorial plane and two particles collide near the horizon to produce two particles .",
    "we find that if the produced particles are as massive as the colliding particles , the energy - extraction efficiency is bounded by @xmath1 approximately .",
    "however , if a very massive particle is allowed to be produced , which has negative energy and necessarily falls into the black hole , the upper limit is increased to @xmath2 , confirming the numerical result in ref .",
