    "neutrinos provide , on a macroscopic scale , the realization of two key concepts of quantum mechanics : linear superposition of states and noncommuting operators .",
    "in fact , there is compelling experimental evidence @xcite that the three known neutrino states with definite flavor ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) are linear combinations of states with definite mass @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , and that the hamiltonian of neutrino propagation in vacuum @xcite and matter @xcite does not commute with flavor .",
    "the effects of flavor nonconservation ( `` oscillations '' ) take place on macroscopic distances , for typical ultrarelativistic neutrinos .",
    "the evidence for such effects comes from a series of experiments performed during about four decades of research with very different neutrino beams and detection techniques : the solar neutrino @xcite experiments homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , sage @xcite , gallex - gno @xcite , super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite and sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite ; the long - baseline reactor neutrino @xcite experiment kamland @xcite ; the atmospheric neutrino @xcite experiments kamiokande @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite , macro @xcite , and soudan-2 @xcite ; and the long - baseline accelerator neutrino @xcite experiment kek - to - kamioka ( k2k ) @xcite .    together with the null results from the chooz @xcite ( and palo verde @xcite ) short - baseline reactor experiments , the above oscillation data provide stringent constraints on the basic parameters governing the quantum aspects of neutrino propagation , namely , the superposition coefficients between flavor and mass states ( i.e. , the neutrino mixing matrix ) , the energy levels of the hamiltonian in vacuum ( i.e. , the splittings between squared neutrino masses ) , and the analogous levels in matter ( i.e. , the neutrino interaction energies ) .",
    "the energy levels at rest ( i.e. , the absolute neutrino masses ) are being probed by different , non - oscillation searches : beta decay experiments @xcite , neutrinoless double beta decay searches ( @xmath5 ) @xcite , and precision cosmology @xcite .",
    "current non - oscillation data provide only upper limits on neutrino masses , except for the claim by part of the heidelberg - moscow experimental collaboration @xcite , whose possible @xmath5 signal would imply a lower bound on neutrino masses .",
    "a highly nontrivial result emerging from these different neutrino data sample is their consistency , at a very detailed level , with the simplest extension of the standard electroweak model needed to accommodate nonzero neutrino masses and mixings , namely , with a scenario where the three known flavor states @xmath6 are mixed with only three mass states @xmath7 , no other states or new neutrino interactions being needed .",
    "this `` standard three - neutrino framework '' ( as recently reviewed , e.g. , in @xcite ) appears thus as a new paradigm of particle and astroparticle physics , which will be tested , refined , and possibly challenged by a series of new , more sensitive experiments planned for the next few years or even for the next decades @xcite .",
    "the first challenge might actually come very soon from the running miniboone experiment @xcite , which is probing the only piece of data at variance with the standard three - neutrino framework , namely , the controversial result of the liquid scintillator neutrino experiment ( lsnd ) @xcite .    in this review",
    "we focus on the current status of the standard three - neutrino framework and on the neutrino mass and mixing parameters which characterize it , as derived from a comprehensive , state - of - the - art analysis of a large amount of oscillation and nonoscillation neutrino data ( as available in august 2005 ) .",
    "all the results and figures shown in the review are either new or updated or improved in various ways , with respect to our previous publications in the field of neutrino phenomenology . in this sense we have tried to be as complete as possible , so as to present a self - consistent overview of the current status of the three - neutrino mass - mixing parameters . while we aimed at obtaining technically accurate and complete results , we have not aimed at being bibliographically complete ; we refer the reader to @xcite for an incomplete list of excellent reviews with rich bibliographies of old and recent neutrino papers .",
    "while for quark mixing a standard notation and parametrization has emerged @xcite , this is not ( yet ) the case for ( some ) neutrino mass and mixing parameters . in this section",
    "we define and motivate the conventions used hereafter .      at the lagrangian level ,",
    "the left - handed neutrino fields with definite flavors @xmath8 @xmath9 are assumed to be linear superpositions of the neutrino fields with definite masses @xmath10 @xmath11 , through a unitary complex matrix @xmath12 : @xmath13 this convention implies @xcite that one - particle neutrino states @xmath14 are instead related by @xmath15 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath16 is : @xmath17 where the @xmath18 s are real euler rotations with angles @xmath19 $ ] @xcite , while @xmath20 embeds a cp - violating phase @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 notice that the above definitions imply @xmath23 , which may be a useful property in some theoretical contexts @xcite .    by considering @xmath24 as a single ( complex ) rotation , this parametrization coincides with the one recommended ( together with eq .",
    "( [ ustar ] ) ) in the review of particle properties @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "other conventions sometimes used in the literature involve @xmath28 instead of @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ ustar ] ) , or @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , or only one cp - violating factor ( either @xmath20 or @xmath31 , not both ) in eq .",
    "( [ euler ] ) , or a combination of the above . in our opinion",
    "such alternatives , although legitimate , do not bring particular advantages over the above convention .    for the sake of simplicity , the phase @xmath32 will not be considered in full generality in this work .",
    "numerical examples will refer , when needed , only to the two inequivalent cp - conserving cases , namely , @xmath33 .",
    "in these two cases , the mixing matrix takes a real form @xmath34 , @xmath35 where the upper ( lower ) sign refers to @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the two cases are formally related by the replacement @xmath38 . in any case , cp violation effects do not affect at all solar and reactor oscillation searches , where the indistinguishability of @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the final state allows to rotate away both the angle @xmath41 and the cp phase @xmath32 from the parameter space , even in the presence of matter effects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the current neutrino phenomenology implies that the three - neutrino mass spectrum @xmath42 is formed by a `` doublet '' of relatively close states and by a third `` lone '' neutrino state , which may be either heavier than the doublet ( `` normal hierarchy , '' nh ) or lighter ( `` inverted hierarchy , '' ih ) . in the most",
    "frequently adopted labeling of such states , the lightest ( heaviest ) neutrino in the doublet is called @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , so that their squared mass difference is @xmath45 by convention .",
    "the lone state is then labeled as @xmath46 , and the physical sign of @xmath47 distinguishes nh from ih . in both nh and ih . in this case , however , the mixing angles @xmath48 have a different meaning in nh and ih .",
    "] very often , the second independent squared mass difference @xmath49 is taken to be either @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "however , these two definitions may not be completely satisfactory in _ both _ hierarchies .",
    "in fact , in passing from nh to ih , the difference @xmath50 not only changes its sign , but also changes from being the largest squared mass gap to being the next - to - largest gap ( while the opposite happens for @xmath51 ) .",
    "whenever terms of o(@xmath52 ) are relevant , this fact makes somewhat tricky the comparison of results obtained in different hierarchies . for such reason",
    ", we prefer to define @xmath49 as @xcite @xmath53 so that the two hierarchies are simply related by the transformation @xmath54 .",
    "the largest and next - to - largest squared mass gaps are given @xmath55 in both cases .",
    "more precisely , the squared mass matrix @xmath56 reads , in our conventions , @xmath57 where the upper ( lower ) sign refers to normal ( inverted ) hierarchy .    in the previous equation ,",
    "the term proportional to the unit matrix @xmath58 is irrelevant in neutrino oscillations , while it matters in observables sensitive to the absolute neutrino mass scale , such as in @xmath59-decay and precision cosmology . in particular",
    ", we remind that @xmath59-decay experiments are sensitive to the so - called effective electron neutrino mass @xmath60 , @xmath61^\\frac{1}{2}= \\left[c^2_{13}c^2_{12}m^2_1+c^2_{13}s^2_{12}m^2_2+s^2_{13}m^2_3 \\right]^\\frac{1}{2}\\ , \\ ] ] as far as the single @xmath62 mass states are not experimentally resolvable @xcite . on the other hand , precision cosmology is sensitive , to a good approximation ( up to small hierarchy - dependent effects which may become important in next - generation precision measurements @xcite ) to the sum of neutrino masses @xmath63 @xcite , @xmath64      if neutrinos are indistinguishable from their antiparticles ( i.e. , if they are majorana rather than dirac neutrinos ) , the mixing matrix @xmath28 acquires a ( diagonal ) extra factor @xcite @xmath65 which is parametrized in various ways in the literature .",
    "in particular , within the review of particle properties , two different conventions are used @xcite .",
    "we adopt the one in @xcite , which  after a slight change in notation ",
    "reads : @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 being unknown majorana phases .",
    "the `` advantage '' of this convention is that , in the expression of the effective majorana mass @xmath69 probed in neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath70 experiments @xcite , the cp - violating phase @xmath32 is formally absent : @xmath71      in the flavor basis , the hamiltonian of ultrarelativistic ( @xmath72 ) neutrino propagation in matter reads @xcite @xmath73 up to an irrelevant momentum term @xmath74 which , acting as a zero - point energy , produces only an unobservable overall phase in flavor oscillation phenomena . in the above equation ,",

    "the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath88 are often called `` effective '' neutrino masses and mixing angles in matter .",
    "we remind that , in the absence of matter effect , and within the two cp - conserving cases @xmath93 , the ( vacuum ) flavor oscillation probability @xmath94 takes the form @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the neutrino pathlength .",

    "the constraints on the neutrino oscillation parameters have been obtained by fitting accurate theoretical predictions to a large set of experimental data , through either least - square or maximum - likelihood methods . in both cases ,",
    "parameter estimations reduce to finding the minimum of a @xmath101 function ( see the appendix ) and to tracing iso-@xmath102 contours around it .",

    "solar neutrino data are analyzed through the pull method discussed in @xcite .",
    "with respect to @xcite , chlorine @xcite and super - kamiokande data @xcite are unchanged , while gallium results have been updated @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sno - i ( no salt ) results @xcite already discussed in @xcite , we include in this work the complete sno - ii data ( with salt ) @xcite , namely , day and night charged - current ( cc ) spectra ( 17 + 17 bins ) , and global day and night neutral - current ( nc ) and elastic - scattering ( es ) event rates ( 2 + 2 bins ) , together with 16 new sources of correlated systematic errors affecting the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "correlations of statistical errors ( treated as in @xcite ) in sno - ii data @xcite are also included .",

    "figure  1 shows the current solar neutrino constraints from separate data sets ( chlorine , gallium , sk , sno ) at the @xmath126 level , using the bs05 ( op ) ssm input @xcite . in each panel , we also superpose the small region allowed at @xmath126 around @xmath127 ev@xmath128 and @xmath129 , which provides _ the _ solution to the solar neutrino problem @xcite at large mixing angle ( lma ) . in fig .  1",
    "one can appreciate that the global lma solution completely overlaps with each of the regions separately allowed by the different experimental data ( at @xmath126 ) , i.e. , there is a strong consistency between different observations .",
    "the shape of the global solar lma solution appears to be dominated by sno and ( to a lesser extent ) by the sk experiment .",
    "since both sk and sno are sensitive to the high - energy tail of the solar neutrino spectrum ( i.e. , to the @xmath130b neutrino flux @xcite ) , and since the sno determination of the @xmath130b flux is already a factor of two more accurate than the corresponding prediction in the bs05 ( op ) standard solar model ( see next sec .",

    "1 is rather robust with respect to possible variations in the standard solar model input ( including those related to the recent chemical controversy about the solar photospheric metallicity @xcite ) .",

    "the value of @xmath144 decreases from its vacuum value ( @xmath146 ) to its matter - dominated value @xmath147 as the energy increases . the vacuum - matter transition is faster for neutrinos produced in the inner regions of the sun . in fig .",
    "3 we also show the small difference between day ( d ) and night ( n ) curves , due to matter effects in the earth ( calculated , for definiteness , at the sno latitude ) .",
    "the vacuum - matter transition is slightly slower during the night , due to the earth regeneration effect ( see @xcite and references therein ) . within current energy thresholds and experimental uncertainties ,",
    "the vacuum - matter transition and the earth regeneration effects have not been yet observed in the sk @xcite and sno @xcite time - energy spectra .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall see later , matter effects in the sun must definitely occur to explain the data .",
    "let us consider now the impact of kamland data . for typical lma parameters ,",
    "reactor @xmath120 are expected to have a relatively large oscillation amplitude ( @xmath148 ) , as well as a sizable oscillation phase [ @xmath149 over long baselines ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "the @xmath120 disappearance signal observed in kamland @xcite has not only confirmed the solar lma solution but has greatly reduced its @xmath83 range @xcite , by observing a strong distortion in the energy spectrum @xcite .",

    "the overall reactor neutrino disappearance ( rate information ) and its energy distribution ( shape information ) are highly consistent , the latter being dominant in the combination . at the @xmath126 level , both the shape - only and",
    "the rate+shape analyses identify a single solution at @xmath152 ev@xmath128 and large mixing ; only at the @xmath151 level two disconnected solutions appear at higher and lower values of @xmath83 .",

    "figure  5 shows the regions separately allowed by all solar neutrino data and by kamland , both separately and in combination , at the 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath153 level .",
    "the current solar lma solution , as compared with results prior to complete sno - ii data ( see , e.g. , @xcite , is slightly shifted toward larger values of @xmath124 and allows higher values of @xmath154 . and @xmath155 this trend is substantially due to the larger value of the cc / nc ratio measured in the complete sno ii phase ( 0.34 @xcite ) with respect to the previous central value ( 0.31 @xcite ) .",
    "we also find that the sno - ii cc spectral data @xcite contribute to allow slightly higher values of @xmath83 with respect to older results .",
    "the consistency of solar and reactor allowed regions is impressive , with a large overlap even at the @xmath156 level , and with very close best - fit points .",
    "the solar+kamland combination eliminates the extra ( kamland - only ) solutions at high and low @xmath83 , and identifies a single allowed region characterized by the following @xmath126 ranges : @xmath157 @xmath158 the determination of these two parameters at @xmath159 level represents one of the most remarkable successes of the last few years in neutrino physics .",
    "the @xmath83 uncertainty is currently dominated by the kamland observation of half - period of oscillations @xcite and can be improved with higher statistics @xcite .",

    "while for @xmath118 the solar+kamland parameter space reduces to @xmath228 exactly , the atmospheric+k2k parameter space reduces to @xmath238 only to a first approximation .",
    "indeed , while the assumption @xmath118 forbids solar and reactor @xmath239 transitions involving @xmath46 and its associated parameters ( @xmath240 ) , it does not forbid , e.g. , atmospheric @xmath241 transitions involving the pair @xmath121 , which depend on the @xmath83 parameter .",
    "this is most easily seen in the vacuum case , where eq .",

    "as expected , both effects are small , but there is no reason to keep the first and to neglect the second . moreover",
    ", the lma effect intriguingly breaks the @xmath41 octant sysmmetry , which is in principle an important indication for model building ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the k2k constraints are octant - symmetric and relatively weak in @xmath249 , while they contribute appreciably to reduce the overall @xmath49 uncertainty .",
