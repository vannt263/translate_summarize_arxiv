    "krebes discoverd that the greatest common divisor of the determinant of a numerator and denominator of a tangle embedded in a link divides the determinant of the link ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover he constructed a map from tangles to formal fractions ( not necessarily reduced ) , and the map on the algebraic tangles is surjective .    in this paper , we extend the slope of rational tangles to one of algebraic tangles by means of the boundary slope of essential surfaces in algebraic tangles , and show that a map from algebraic tangles to the boundary slopes coincides with `` reduced '' krebes s invariant .",
    "this map induces a homomorphism from the algebraic tangles to the rational number .",
