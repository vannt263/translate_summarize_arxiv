    "there are multiple lines of evidence that shocks play an important role in shaping the multiwavelength emission from nova outflows . among these",
    "are the peculiar early - time radio light curves exhibiting significantly higher brightness temperatures than can be explained by passively cooling expanding outflows ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . among the most compelling evidence to date",
    "is the unexpected detection of gev gamma - rays from three classical novae by _ fermi_/lat in 2012 - 2013 : v959 monocerotis , v1324 scorpii and v339 delphini ( @xcite ) ; since then , at least 2 more novae , v1369 cen and v5668 sgr , have been detected with high significance ( @xcite ) .",
    "the comparatively high gev luminosities of novae suggest that shocks dissipate a sizable fraction of the total energy budget , and could in some cases even dominate the optical output @xcite .    despite clear evidence for shocks ,",
    "their origin and location within the nova outflow remains uncertain .",
    "@xcite suggests a connection between the shocks and the bipolar geometry of the nova outflow ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) , which in turn could be shaped by the gravity of the orbiting binary companion ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is challenging to confirm because the shock emission can not be resolved when the gamma - rays are detected near the peak of the nova outburst .",
    "compared to the vast range of different astrophysical sources where shocks play a significant role , the shocks in nova outflows probe a fairly unique regime in parameter space , characterized by relatively high densities and low velocities . in this regime",
    "the shocks giving rise to detectable gamma - rays are likely to be radiatively efficient , i.e. all of the dissipated energy is radiated as multiwavelength emission .",
    "several works have been dedicated to calculating the shock emission in different frequency bands , ranging from radio to tev gamma - rays ( @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we focus on the hard x - ray band ( @xmath6 10 kev ) accessible to e.g.  _ nustar _ , and explore in particular the connection between the radiation properties in the x - ray and gamma - ray bands .",
    "our work is motivated by recent _",
    "nustar _ observations of v339 del and v5668 sgr , which place rather stringent upper - limits on the hard x - ray emission simultaneous with the lat detections ( mukai et al .",
    ", in prep ) ; within the framework of our model , these and future observations can be used to place constraints on the location and the electron / ion acceleration efficiencies of the shocks in novae .",
    "although our analysis is focused primarily on shocks in novae , our results are also applicable to other astrophysical sources of non - relativistic radiative shocks .",
    "these include , for instance , the dense colliding stellar winds of massive binary stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and type iin supernovae , in which the supernova ejecta collides with a dense external shell of gas surrounding the progenitor star ( e.g. ,  , @xcite ) .",
    "shocks taking place in e.g. gamma - ray novae ( @xmath7  cm  s@xmath8 ) and type iin supernovae ( @xmath9  cm  s@xmath8 ) heat the bulk of the gas to x - ray temperatures . in sufficiently dense media ,",
    "the cooling time of the shocked gas is short compared to the dynamical time of the system .",
    "this results in strong compression of the gas in the shock downstream as it cools ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "strong observational evidence also exists that non - relativistic shocks can accelerate particles ( either electrons and/or protons / ions ) to ultrarelativistic energies , which emit broadband non - thermal radiation from radio to gamma - ray frequencies .",
    "however , in contrast to relativistic shocks , in non - relativistic radiative shocks the cooling time of the relativistic particles can exceed the cooling / compression time of the thermal gas behind the shock .",
    "this has two effects on the non - thermal particles and their radiation : ( 1 ) the rising density in the downstream alters the relative importance of different radiative processes , most importantly relativistic bremsstrahlung and inverse compton ( ic ) emission , and ( 2 ) rapid adiabatic compression supplies additional energy to the non - thermal particles .",
    "thermal cooling thus affects both the radiative efficiency and spectral shape of the non - thermal emission .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to establish a theoretical framework which enables one to combine non - thermal x - ray and gamma - ray data into a diagnostic tool for the shock environment and the properties of non - thermal particle acceleration .",
    "regardless of whether leptonic or hadronic processes are responsible for the gamma - ray emission , the same radiative processes inevitably also gives rise to x - ray radiation .",
    "the relative luminosity in the x - ray and gamma - ray bands , @xmath10 is most sensitive to the ratio of matter to radiation energy density , which in turn depends on the density of the shocked gas and the location of the shock within the nova outflow .",
    "the ratio @xmath10 is also sensitive to whether hadrons or leptons dominate the accelerated non - thermal particle populations and on the injected particle spectra .    in the leptonic scenario ,",
    "gamma - ray emission is the result of direct electron acceleration ; the dominant non - thermal radiative processes are relativistic bremsstrahlung and ic scattering .",
    "the observed gamma - ray luminosities require the injected energy spectrum to be almost logarithmically flat , i.e. @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the particle lorentz factor ) , to avoid an energy crisis ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the approximately flat @xmath14 spectra observed in gamma - ray novae ( @xcite ) . if @xmath11 , the bremsstrahlung and ic spectra are similarly flat in the gamma - ray range , thus limiting the diagnostic value of the gamma - ray spectrum alone in determining the density and radiation compactness of the shock .",
    "non - thermal hard x - ray emission provides an independent diagnostic , which is comparatively more luminous at low densities and high ( optical ) luminosities , for which ic cooling dominates the non - thermal emission .",
    "the high gev luminosities of lat - detected novae require shocks to occur in relatively dense environments .",
    "non - thermal x - ray emission in such cases results from a combination of bremsstrahlung and ic emission , modified by coulomb ( and possibly synchrotron ) losses . indeed",
    ", we will show that electrons with lorentz factors @xmath15 lose most of their energy via coulomb collisions with the thermal population , which significanly ( though not completely ) suppresses their radiative output below the lat band . as a result",
    ", the gamma - ray spectrum breaks to a steeper slope at energies below a few hundred mev ; a naive extrapolation of the lat spectrum to the _ nustar _ band would therefore grossly overestimate the x - ray flux , by as much as three orders of magnitude .    in the hadronic scenario , when the energy in accelerated protons dominates over electrons ,",
    "the gamma - rays are mainly generated by the production and decay of neutral pions ( @xmath16 ) , created by proton - proton / ion collisions .",
    "these collisions also produce charged pions ( @xmath17 ) that ultimately decay into relativistic electron - positron pairs carrying energy comparable to that in gamma - rays from @xmath18 decay . as in the leptonic model ,",
    "the created pairs radiate both x - rays and gamma - rays via bremsstrahlung and ic emission , which dominates the emission between @xmath0  kev and @xmath19  mev .",
    "the main difference from the leptonic scenario is the paucity of injected pairs with energies well below the pion rest mass @xmath19  mev , which would otherwise make a significant contribution to the x - ray flux ( despite coulomb losses ) .",
    "overall , the additional @xmath18 gamma rays , coupled with fewer x - ray emitting leptons , result in systematically lower ratio of x - ray to gamma - ray flux in the hadronic scenario .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : rad_mech ] we give an overview of the radiative processes relevant in nova shocks .",
    "the evolution of the heated plasma in the downstream of radiative shocks is discussed in section [ sec : gasdyn ] . in section [ sec : nthevo ] we describe the evolution of non - thermal particle distributions as they radiate and cool in the compressing downstream flow . a theoretical overview of the x- and gamma - ray emission from the cooling layer is given in section [ sec : emission ] .",
    "the numerical results and the constraints on parameter space from simultaneous hard x - ray and gamma - ray observations are presented in sections [ sec : xgratio ] and [ sec : mdotn ] .",
    "our results are discussed and conclusions summarized in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "consider the plasma downstream of a non - relativistic shock .",
    "the bulk of the shock energy is transferred to thermal plasma , which provides the pressure support in the immediate downstream . at shock velocities",
    "@xmath20  cm  s@xmath8 the post - shock temperature corresponds to soft x - rays ( @xmath21 , where @xmath22  cm  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the thermal plasma cools via free - free emission and line cooling .",
    "the latter dominates at @xmath23  k ; the shock is thus radiative if @xmath24 , where @xmath25 @xmath26 is the mean molecular weight appropriate for nova composition ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath27 @xmath28 is the upstream density , and we have approximated @xmath29  erg  @xmath30  s@xmath8 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . on a week",
    "timescale relevant for gamma - ray emission , the shock is likely to be radiative if @xmath31  cm  s@xmath8 unless the density is very low , which however would result in a gamma - ray luminosity too low to be detected by _",
    "fermi _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the shock is indeed radiative , cooling of the thermal plasma leads to strong compression in the downstream in order to maintain the required pressure .",
    "this compression is halted only once either non - thermal or magnetic pressure becomes dominant over thermal pressure , or once the gas cools to temperatures @xmath32  k below which line cooling becomes less efficient due to recombination of the gas .",
    "the luminous thermal @xmath33 kev x - rays from the gamma - ray emitting shocks are not directly observable , as they are absorbed by bound - free processes in the material ahead of the shock .",
    "kev thermal x - ray emission of luminosity @xmath34 erg s@xmath8 within days to weeks of the ouburst ( e.g. v5589 sgr ; @xcite ) , consistent with being powered by adiabatic ( non - radiative ) shocks (; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the kinetic power of these ` fast ' x - ray producing shocks are generally too low to explain the luminous lat gev emission , suggesting that they originate from a different location within the ejecta ( e.g.  @xcite ) . ] instead , this energy is reprocessed to lower frequencies and released as optical / uv radiation ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , non - thermal x - rays with higher energy @xmath1  kev are not significantly attenuated by bound - free absorption , and only interact with the ejecta via compton ( thomson ) scattering .",
    "they could therefore potentially be detected at early times simultaneously with the gamma - ray emission .",
    "in addition to thermal heating , a portion of the shock energy is used to accelerate a fraction of the electrons and/or baryons into a non - thermal distribution . in the leptonic scenario ,",
    "the relativistic electrons cool via ic emission on ( primarily ) optical / uv photons , relativistic bremsstrahlung emission , coulomb collisions with thermal electrons , and synchrotron emission if the downstream is appreciably magnetized .",
    "the interplay between these processes determines both the dominant radiative mechanism at hard x- and gamma - ray frequencies , as well as the partitioning of the non - thermal luminosity between different bands .",
    "the key parameter that determines the dominant cooling mechanism of relativistic electrons is the ratio of soft ( optical ) radiation energy density ( that determines the ic cooling rate ) to matter density ( determines bremsstrahlung and coulomb losses ) can be defined as the ratio of radiation compactness @xmath35 to the thomson opacity @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "] , @xmath38 for typical parameters in gamma - ray novae one obtains @xmath39 where @xmath40 erg s@xmath8 is the optical luminosity , @xmath41 cm is the shock radius .",
    "we have used @xmath42 , i.e.  neglecting the @xmath43 correction under the assumption that the thomson optical depth @xmath44 of the shocks is @xmath45 .",
    "if the bulk of the optical luminosity is generated by reprocessed emission from the shock itself , then @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fraction of the total solid angle subtended by the shock . again expressing @xmath48 , one obtains from equation ( [ eq : chi ] ) @xmath49 this represents the minimal value of @xmath50 that can be attained at a given shock speed .",
    "consider separately the cooling rates by different processes .",
    "free - free emission from electrons of energy @xmath51  a  few receives comparable contributions from electron - electron and electron - proton bremsstrahlung . for analytical estimates",
    "we employ the approximate expression ( accurate within @xmath52  % for @xmath53 ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the _ downstream _ density of the shock , @xmath56 is the fine structure constant , and the sum is taken over the atomic species of mass fraction @xmath57 , charge @xmath58 and atomic weight @xmath59 .",
    "we use a more accurate expression valid in both relativistic and non - relativistic regimes given by @xcite in our numerical calculations .",
    "the ic cooling rate in the thomson regime is @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "its ratio to the bremsstrahlung cooling rate is ( in the @xmath62 limit ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 here , the first case assumes that the optical luminosity is external to , and greater than , that generated at the shock . in the second case the optical luminosity is given by equation ( [ eq : lsh ] ) .",
    "the coulomb cooling rate is @xmath65 the ratio of bremsstrahlung and coulomb cooling is independent of the shock parameters , @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the electron energy below which bremsstrahlung emission is affected by coulomb losses .    depending on the downstream magnetization",
    ", synchrotron radiation can also be significant .",
    "though synchrotron emission is unlikely to be detectable at early times when gamma rays are observed , due to free - free absorption ( @xcite ) , it manifests indirectly by attenuating the power emitted in the lat band . in complete analogy with ic cooling ,",
    "the ratio of synchrotron to bremsstrahlung cooling rates is @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 here @xmath71 parametrizes the post - shock magnetic energy density in terms of the total energy density as @xmath72 .",
    "the above expressions for @xmath73 and @xmath74 are calculated for conditions immediately after the shock . however , when the plasma compresses further downstream , the bremsstrahlung and coulomb cooling rates are enchanced proportionally to @xmath75 , while the ic rate is unaffected by compression . as a result , the lorentz factor above which ic dominates over free - free cooling increases as @xmath76 .",
    "synchrotron losses are also enhanced by compression , to a greater extent than bremsstrahlung : @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and the adiabatic index @xmath79 depending on the magnetic field configuration .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      our discussion so far has considered only the _ intrinsic _ emission from radiative shocks and assumed that the generated x - rays and gamma - rays can freely escape from the ejecta . however , if the shocks take place sufficiently deep in the outflow , the dense ambient material can leave a strong imprint on the escaping radiation . above a few tens of kev ,",
    "the main source of opacity in the outflow is compton scattering . at @xmath80 ,",
    "the average fractional energy loss of a photon in a scattering event is @xmath81 .",
    "emitted at @xmath82 , the photon experiences approximately @xmath83 scatterings before escaping .",
    "thus if @xmath84 , or equivalently @xmath85 , the photon energy is significantly degraded as it diffuses out of the ejecta .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : screen ] : as @xmath86 is increased , the soft gamma - rays ( @xmath87  mev ) are depleted first , followed by hard x - rays at progressively lower energies .",
    "note that if the primary spectrum is sufficiently hard ( @xmath88 with @xmath89 ) , the emission in a given band is initially enhanced as @xmath86 is increased , at the expense of higher - energy photons being downscattered into the band , before being suppressed at higher @xmath86 .    at @xmath90 ,",
    "the klein - nishina cross - section approximately follows @xmath91 , while a photon loses most of its energy in a single scattering event . at 100  mev , @xmath92 ,",
    "i.e. the photons in the lat band suffer significant recoil losses if @xmath93 ( figure [ fig : screen ] ) .",
    "note that high @xmath86 also has the effect of enhancing the ( optical ) radiation density in the ejecta , as @xmath94 .",
    "the @xmath50 parameter is enhanced by the same factor @xmath43 , which has a positive effect on the hard x - ray emission ( figures [ fig : ratio : lept ] and [ fig : ratio : hadr ] ) .    in summary , for given shock parameters ,",
    "the x - ray to gamma - ray ratio is somewhat increased if @xmath95  a  few . in the range @xmath96 the x - rays",
    "are strongly suppressed while lat gamma rays still escape unhindered . at even higher opacities",
    "the gev gamma - rays are also significantly degraded .",
    "non - thermal emission from non - relativistic shocks provides a wealth of information about the shock environment as well as the physics of particle acceleration . in dense media characteristic of e.g. nova eruptions during the first weeks , the heated plasma rapidly cools and compresses behind the shock due to line - cooling and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the unique property of slow ( @xmath97  cm  s@xmath8 ) shocks is that the cooling time of the relativistic particles responsible for the hard x - ray and gamma - ray emission is longer than the thermal cooling / compression time .",
    "thus the high - energy radiation samples a range of physical conditions behind the shock front , where the density as well as magnetization can change by a few orders of magnitude .    in this work",
    "we have computed the non - thermal emission from the cooling layer behind the shock front , due to relativistic bremsstrahlung and ic upscattering of thermal ( optical ) radiation , as well as hadronic collisions leading to both gamma - ray and @xmath98 production .",
    "additional losses due to coulomb collisions with the thermal plasma and synchrotron cooling were also taken into account .",
    "the downstream compression was calculated using a simple prescription by keeping the total pressure constant , and explicitly following the evolution of partial pressures of the thermal and non - thermal plasma as well as the magnetic field as the plasma cools .",
    "the focus of our analysis was on using spectral information from flux ratios in different bands to constrain the physical conditions at the shock as well as particle acceleration mechanisms .",
    "in particular , we concentrated on the hard x - ray and gev gamma - ray bands accessible to _ nustar _ and _ fermi_/lat , respectively .",
    "in contrast to soft x - rays , hard x - ray radiation is more likely to be representative of the intrinsic non - thermal emission from the shock : it is not impeded by bound - free absorption and can only be degraded by compton recoil if @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , the hard x - ray band is less likely to be contaminated by free - free emission from shock - heated thermal electrons , except if @xmath100  cm  s@xmath8 .    in radiative shocks",
    ", the gamma - ray output above a few hundred mev roughly traces the total energy placed into @xmath101  gev particles , even though the detailed spectrum depends on the particular model of particle acceleration as well as the dominant radiative process .",
    "in contrast , emission at lower frequencies is more sensitive to the physical conditions near the shock . if the shock is embedded in an external radiation field with luminosity exceeding the shock - dissipated power ( usually expected in novae ) , the fraction of non - thermal energy emerging in the x - ray band anticorrelates with density .    at very low densities ( @xmath102 , see equation [ eq : chi ] ) ic cooling dominates the electron ( positron ) energy loss , and comparable energy is radiated in the x - ray and gamma - ray bands by leptonic emission .",
    "this regime corresponds to low shock power . at high densities ( @xmath103 ) , relativistic bremsstrahlung and coulomb collisions are the dominant cooling mechanisms for @xmath45  gev electrons . in this regime ,",
    "the hard x - ray emission is a superposition of the low - energy tails of the bremsstrahlung spectra from relativistic leptons between @xmath104 a few to @xmath105 , attenuated by coulomb losses .",
    "the high density / low @xmath50 regime corresponds to high shock power and is therefore most relevant for practical ( detection ) purposes , however the ratio of x - ray to gamma - ray energies is relatively low in this case , @xmath106 . in the extreme high density limit the x - ray to gamma - ray ratio approaches an asymptotic value in both leptonic and hadronic scenarios , which is approximately three times higher in the leptonic case .",
    "there is mounting evidence that strong shocks are commonplace in classical novae , which provide an independent avenue of constraining the the properties of nova outflows .",
    "fermi_/lat and optical observations of e.g. v1324 and v399 del already strongly limit the allowable parameter space ( @xcite ) ; in particular , they place a lower limit on the shock luminosity , which can be written as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 .",
    "we have shown that the degeneracy between @xmath109 and @xmath110 can be lifted , at least in principle , by a concurrent hard x - ray observation .",
    "the relevant observational measure is the ratio of x - ray and gamma - ray fluxes , which places an independent constraint on the allowed region @xmath111 space , without explicit reference to e.g. the shock radius or geometry .",
    "unfortunately , the presently available _ nustar _",
    "upper limits for two classical novae , v339 del and v5668 sgr , are not sufficiently deep to yield significant constraints , given their gamma - ray fluxes .",
    "there is reason for optimism , however , since the flux limits attainable by a @xmath3 ks _ nustar _ observation ( as performed for v5668 sgr ) of novae with higher gamma - ray fluxes such as e.g. v1324 sco or v959 mon would start pushing the theoretical limit of the @xmath112 ratio , and likely result in a detection . failing",
    "that , a deep upper limit could still be useful by ruling out leptonic models , for which @xmath113 for any reasonable parameters .",
    "a low x - ray luminosity could instead result from attenuation due to inelastic electron scattering by a high column of gas ahead of the shock with optical depth @xmath114 , in which case constraints on the shock properties from an x - ray non - detection would not be as strong ; however , for @xmath115 the 100 mev gamma - ray emission would itself be blocked , thus limiting the range of @xmath86 over which this explanation would be viable to roughly one order of magnitude .",
    "the model presented in this paper assumes a 1d planar shock , and constant post - shock pressure .",
    "these simplifications may be questionable given the highly multi - dimensional thermal and thin - shell instabilities known to plague radiative shocks ( e.g.  @xcite , ) .",
    "nevertheless , insofar as the local thermodynamic conditions experienced by a cooling parcel of thermal and relativistic particles are reasonably captured by the simple processes of cooling and compression described here , these complications should not impact the qualitative features of our results .",
    "the colliding stellar winds of early - type stars ( o , b , wolf - rayet ) in binary systems give rise to strong shocks that can accelerate both electrons and protons to high energies ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the existence of relativistic particles in these systems has been proven by the detection of radio synchrotron emission ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . to date , no gamma rays have been detected in cwb ( with the possible exception of @xmath116 carinae ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; upper limits for a sample of 7 systems have been obtained by _",
    "fermi_/lat ( @xcite ) .",
    "non - thermal x - rays have not been detected yet with _ integral _ ( e.g.  @xcite ) , although @xcite present _ suzaku _ observations showing evidence for a hard power - law x - ray component in wr140 .    in tight binaries such as wr20a , or near the periastron passage of eccentric systems ( e.g. wr 140 )",
    "the particle densities at the shock are comparable to those expected in novae , and the shocks may become radiative .",
    "the shock / wind velocities are also similar , typically @xmath117  cm  s@xmath8 ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . however , the mass outflow rate , @xmath118  yr@xmath8 is typically somewhat lower than in classical nova eruptions",
    ". combined with comparable or higher optical / uv luminosities , @xmath119 , the cooling regime of the relativistic particles differs from novae .",
    "this can be seen by writing the @xmath50 parameter as @xmath120 recalling figure [ fig : cool ] ( left panel ) , one concludes that the relativistic leptons cool predominantly by ic emission rather than bremsstrahlung ( or coulomb ) ; furthermore , the ic cooling of the hard x - ray and gamma - ray emitting electrons is typically _",
    "faster _ than the cooling of the thermal plasma ( equation [ eq : ticrel ] ) .",
    "therefore , in leptonic models the x - ray and gamma - ray emissivities are not sigificantly affected by downstream compression , nor are the x - rays necessarily suppressed by coulomb losses . as a result , the energy emitted in the hard x - ray and gamma - ray bands can be comparable ( figure [ fig : ratio : lept ] ) .",
    "in the hadronic scenario , the cooling time via pp - collisions relative to the compression time depends only on the shock velocity ( equation ( [ eq : tpprel ] ) and figure [ fig : cool ] , right panel ) . if @xmath121  cm  s@xmath8 , the accelerated protons deposit most of their energy only after the thermal pressure has been lost and the downstream plasma has significantly compressed .",
    "this mainly affects the x - ray emission from secondary @xmath98 pairs from @xmath17 decay , which can experience both synchrotron losses in the compression - enhanced magnetic field , as well as increased bremsstrahlung losses that give rise to harder spectra .",
    "therefore the x - ray to gamma - ray ratio is expected to be over an order of magnitude lower than in the leptonic case .",
    "the _ fermi _ upper limits ( @xcite ) are at odds with theoretical predictions for the gamma - ray flux by several groups ( @xcite ; ; ) . the discrepancy has not yet been resolved .",
    "strong synchrotron losses could provide a possible explanation if the downstream plasma is able to compress and amplify the magnetic field before the relativistic particles have cooled .",
    "this however requires the colliding winds to be dense and relatively slow .",
    "note also that gamma - ray emission in hadronic models is not significantly affected by synchrotron losses , as the gamma - rays are produced predominantly via @xmath18 decay . on the other hand ,",
    "the general lack of observed hard x - rays ( @xcite ) could be explained in the hadronic scenario , owing to the abovementioned suppression via synchrotron and bremsstrahlung losses .",
