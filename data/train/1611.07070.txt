    "the feature is most apparent during epoch  2 and has disappeared by epoch  3 .",
    "epoch  3 is notable both for the singular dominance of feature @xmath12 , but also because the polarization angle change between the blue and red halves of the spectrum that was seen in epochs 1 and 2 has disappeared .",

    "it is immediately clear that there are a few candidates to explain the polarization in features @xmath11 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "feature @xmath11 is located in a rapidly evolving portion of the spectrum where the absorption lines of s  ii , fe  ii , and si  ii overlap .",
    "hv si  ii and photospheric si  ii are present over the indicated wavelength range in epoch  1 , but by epoch  2 the absorption from hv si  ii is no longer evident . perhaps this is the reason why the polarization is not as well defined at the bluer wavelengths in epoch  2 as the opacity , and therefore the covering factor , of hv si  ii decreases .",
    "s  ii and hv fe  ii show multiple absorption features over the wavelength range of feature @xmath11 and could therefore be contenders .",
    "photospheric fe",
    "ii also has some absorption over this region , but the emission feature at shorter wavelengths must be included to explain the entire polarization feature in at least epoch  1 .    by examining the individual flux spectra of epoch  1",
    ", we see that mg  ii and hv fe  ii are the ions with absorption features most contained within the defined wavelength interval of feature @xmath13 .",
    "photospheric fe  ii and fe  iii , however , also have absorption features that at least partially fall across the wavelength range .",
    "s  ii is the only ion with absorption features associated with feature @xmath14 .",
    "we note that photospheric and hv fe  ii and fe  iii have emission components across this range .",
    "the elaborate blend of several elements in the flux spectrum of sn  2011fe does not allow us to determine with certainty if one particular element is the root of the ejecta asymmetries , however , we explore three possibilities , which we label as _ interpretations 1 - 3_. in _ interpretation 1 _ , we assign feature a to si  ii absorption from a complex of si  ii absorption lines ( rest frame @xmath16  , @xmath17  , @xmath18  ) seen in _ synapps _ fits .",
    "if photospheric si  ii were the cause of line polarization at 4800  , then each absorption feature of this element at optical wavelengths can be connected to line polarization features in epochs 1 and 2 .",
    "this includes the small feature at 5700   that has been associated with si  ii @xmath19 and @xmath20 in sn  2004dt ( wang et al .",
    "however , to explain the broad polarization in epoch  1 at 4800  , we must include hv si  ii in feature @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately the other absorption of this hv ion at 5900   is not associated with line polarization which is a point of conflict for this interpretation . similarly , if si  ii explains both features @xmath11 and @xmath12 , then it is hard to explain the changing difference in angle between these two components .",
    "si  ii is also not a viable candidate to explain feature @xmath13 or @xmath14 . for _ interpretation 1 _",
    ", we speculate that feature @xmath11 traces the same asymmetric layers in the sn atmosphere that are seen in feature @xmath12 in epoch 2 and 3 , but at an earlier time .",
    "this may be an important clue to the changes revealed by the receeding sn photosphere , which may be able to provide constraints on radiative transfer models of the observed polarization behavior .",
    "_ interpretation 2 _ assigns feature @xmath11 to fe  ii and fe  iii . we note that the shifting absorption features of the iron complexes could explain why feature @xmath11 is not as well defined in epoch  2 as compared to epoch  1 .",
    "feature @xmath13 is then also explained by fe  ii and fe  iii , with the relative strengths between features @xmath11 and @xmath13 matching the absorption rather well .",
    "hv fe  ii is also a potential contributor , although the second absorption from hv fe  ii of the @xmath8 fits shift to the blue and therefore cause part of the feature to move beyond the peak of the polarization feature .",
    "a similar situation occurs for photospheric fe  ii and fe  iii , but the effect is to shift the absorption profiles into better sync with the polarization feature . in general",
    ", the iron complexes absorb over a broad wavelength range and therefore make it difficult to match line polarization features with individual absorption features .",
    "_ interpretation 3 _ assigns feature @xmath11 to s  ii .",
    "there is strong absorption of s  ii where the line polarization feature appears , but if s  ii is also to explain feature @xmath14 , there is the issue that the polarization strength ratio does not match the ratio of the strength of the two broad absorption components .",
    "these interpretations we outline above have been mentioned in previously published studies of spectropolarimetry of other sne ia ( see section 4 ) .",
    "there is not enough information to confidently distinguish between the three interpretations for sn  2011fe , but we are hopeful that this dataset can be studied in combination with other normal sne ia that we have observed to determine if any of the three possibilities are favored in general .    regardless of the interpretion of the source of the features , the line polarization can be further studied by plotting the evolution of features @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath21 space ( figure [ fig : qu - loops ] ) . in epochs 2 & 3 , the @xmath06355   line is seen to exhibit a loop in the polarization ( top panel ) .",
    "interestingly , the loop appears counterclockwise when moving blue to red during epoch  2 , but the same loop rotates clockwise in epoch 3 .",
    "as loops are suggested to be present when there is a deviation from axial symmetry , the si  ii distribution appears to deviate from spherical symmetry , but without exhibiting dominant axial symmetry .",
    "the lower panel shows the same presentation for feature  @xmath11 , in this case exhibiting a hint of multiple loops during epoch  1 in the same quadrant as feature  @xmath11 . since in all of the interpretations",
    "feature  @xmath11 is actually a complex of lines , it is not clear that a clean loop should be expected .",
    "the red wavelengths of the continuum emission exhibit polarization reaching up to @xmath10.4% in epoch 2 .",
    "the wealth of line polarization features in sn  2011fe makes it difficult to measure the continuum polarization at shorter wavelengths , but there is the suggestion of polarization at the @xmath10.1% level between features @xmath13 an @xmath11 in epochs 1 - 3 ( figs . 4 - 6 ) .",
    "a similar level of red continuum emission was reported for sne  1999by ( howell et al .",
    "2001 ) , 2001el ( wang et al .",
    "2003 ) , 2004s ( chornock & filippenko 2008 ) , and 2005ke ( patat et al .",

    "we show red - continuum polarization of sn  2011fe during epoch 2 compared to sne  1999by and 2005ke , with 2011fe providing a reasonable match with 2005ke .",
    "the increase in polarization toward longer wavelengths has been proposed as beind due to an overall oblate geometry combined with the decreased importance at red - wavelengths of line scattering depolarizing the observed light ( wang 1997 ) .",
    "this hypothesis has been theoretically supported ( e.g. patat et al .",
    "2012 ; bulla et al .",
    "2015 ) , and suggests that longer wavelengths are the best for studying the overall degree of ashpericity in the sn ejecta .",
    "the continuum polarization in the 6300  7400   wavelength range varied with epoch , perhaps best presented in the form of a @xmath22 scatter plot ( figure [ red_cont ] ) .",
    "the continuum polarization is evident during epochs 1 & 2 , but is absent by epoch 4 .",

    "sne  2002bo & 2006x are of the hvg / hv group , so comparisons with 2011fe are perhaps less appropriate than comparisons with sn  2012fr , a member of the lvg / lv group , as the hv / lv differentiation is based on the pre - peak epochs .",
    "however , the presence / absence of feature @xmath11 in early - epoch spectropolarimetry does not appear to be strictly correlated with the hv / lv categorization .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , sn  2012fr is a nuv - red event without a detection of unburned carbon ( see brown et al .",
    "2014 [ sousa ] for uvot photometry and childress et al .",

    "a handful of supernovae have also shown line polarization near 4800  , but at post - maximum epochs ( + 9 days and later for sne 1997dt , 2003du , and 2004s ) , causing the feature to be identified as fe  ii ( leonard et al . 2005 ) .",
    "each of these supernovae only had a single epoch of observation , so we can not say if the line polarization was observable at earlier epochs .",
    "historically , the peak of the si  ii @xmath06355   line , feature @xmath12 , has been used as the measure of p@xmath5 .",
    "although this introduces a dependence on spectral resolution which would be improved through the use of equivalent widths , for the sake of comparison with other sne  ia in the literature , in this work we also use this method .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : psi2_vs_time ] , the evolution of the peak polarization of the @xmath06355   line is 0.24% , 0.34% , 0.52% for epochs 1 - 3 , respectively . in that figure , we generate error bars by determining p@xmath5 for each point in a grid of estimates when @xmath2(isp ) and @xmath3(isp ) are each varied by @xmath40.05% , reflecting the variation of the @xmath2(isp ) and @xmath3(isp ) estimates shown in figure 2 .",
    "the error bars are then the standard deviation of the estimates in that grid , and at a level of @xmath10.03% , they show that the isp estimation does not appreciably affect the evolution of p@xmath5 .",
    "we keep with the formalism of p@xmath5 estimation in the literature and do not subtract the continuum polarization ( which we estimate to be @xmath10.08% ) .",
