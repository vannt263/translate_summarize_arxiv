    "due to its unique characteristics , such as broad spectrum , high flux , and high degree of polarization , the synchrotron radiation ( for reviews see soko86-@xcite ) is an ideal tool for many types of research and also has found industrial applications including materials science , biological and life sciences , medicine , chemistry .",
    "these extensive applications motivate the importance of investigations for various types of mechanisms to control the radiation parameters . in particular , it is of interest to consider the influence of a medium on the spectral - angular characteristics of the radiation intensity .",
    "the synchrotron radiation from a charged particle circulating in a homogeneous and isotropic medium was considered in @xcite , where it has been shown that the interference between the synchrotron and cherenkov radiations leads to remarkable effects . in particular , for high - energy particles and close to the cherenkov threshold the total radiation rate oscillates .",
    "new interesting features arise for the synchrotron radiation in inhomogeneous media . as an exactly solvable problem of this kind , in kota00",
    ", we have studied the radiation from a charge orbiting around / inside a dielectric cylinder immersed into a homogeneous medium . under the cherenkov condition for the material of the cylinder and for the velocity of the particle image on the cylinder surface , strong narrow peaks appear in the angular distribution of the radiation intensity at large distances from the cylinder . at these peaks the radiated energy exceeds the corresponding quantity in the case of a homogeneous medium by several orders of magnitude .",
    "it has been shown that the angular locations of the peaks are determined by the equation that is obtained from the equation determining the eigenmodes for the dielectric cylinder replacing the hankel function of the first kind by the neumann function .",
    "similar features for the radiation generated by a charge moving along a helical orbit around / inside a dielectric cylinder have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "this type of electron motion is employed in helical undulators .",
    "another type of the radiation that attracted a great deal of attention is the smith - purcell radiation ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "it arises when charged particles are in flight near a diffraction grating .",
    "the smith - purcell radiation presents a tunable source of the electromagnetic radiation over a wide range of frequency spectrum .",
    "it has a number of remarkable properties and is widely used in various fields of science and technology for the generation of electromagnetic radiation in different wavelength ranges and for the determination of the characteristics of emitting particles using the properties of the radiation field . in particular , the smith - purcell radiation is one of the basic mechanisms for the generation of electromagnetic waves in the millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "the radiation having similar physical properties and induced by a charged particle in flight over a surface acoustic wave has been discussed in @xcite ( for a more general problem of the radiation from a charge intersecting a periodically deformed dynamical boundary between two media see @xcite ) .",
    "the use of surface waves simplifies the control of the period and the amplitude of the periodic structure and , hence , the angular - frequency characteristics of the emitted radiation . compared to the case of diffraction grating",
    ", the dynamical nature of the periodic structure leads to an additional shift in the radiation frequency for a given direction .",
    "the previous investigations of the smith - purcell effect mainly consider the radiation sources moving along straight trajectories . in this case",
    "the radiation mechanism is purely smith - purcell one ( possibly with an additional cherenkov radiation if the source moves in a medium ) . in the present paper",
    "we consider a problem with two types of radiation mechanisms acting together : synchrotron and smith - purcell ones .",
    "namely , we will study the radiation from a point charge rotating around a metallic diffraction grating on a cylindrical surface , with the strips parallel to the cylinder axis .",
    "note that though the primary source of the radiation for both the synchrotron and smith - purcell emissions is the electromagnetic field of the charged particle , the smith - purcell radiation is formed by the medium as a result of its dynamic polarization by the field of the moving charge .",
    "the smith - purcell effect from an annular electron beam moving parallel to the axis of a cylindrical grating , with the grooves perpendicular to the axis , has been recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "of course , in this case the only radiation mechanism is the smith - purcell one .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in the next section we consider the electromagnetic fields and the radiation from a charge rotating around a solid conducting cylinder .",
    "the surface charge and current densities , induced on the cylinder are determined . by using these densities , in section sec : grat we investigate the vector potential , the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields for a charge rotating around a cylindrical diffraction grating with metallic strips parallel to the cylinder axis .",
    "then we evaluate the spectral - angular density of the radiation intensity and present the results of the numerical analysis for the number of the radiated quanta .",
    "the main results of the paper are summarized in section sec : conc .",
    "in this section we consider the radiation of a point charge @xmath0 , rotating with the velocity @xmath1 along a circle of radius @xmath2 around an infinitely long conducting cylinder with radius @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( see figure fig1 ) . for generality , we assume that the cylinder is immersed into a homogeneous medium with the dielectric permittivity @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding electromagnetic field in the region outside the cylinder is investigated in @xcite ( for the radiation from a charge rotating inside a cylindrical waveguide with dielectric filling see @xcite ) . in accordance with the problem symmetry ,",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath6 with the axis @xmath7 directed along the axis of the cylinder . for the cylindrical coordinates of the charge we shall take @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the angular velocity of the rotation .    for the @xmath10th component of the vector potential one",

    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the bessel function and the hankel function of the first kind , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and@xmath26    having the vector potential we can evaluate the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the corresponding fourier expansions can be written in the form@xmath27where @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the electric and magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "considering the region @xmath30 , for the fourier components of the magnetic field with @xmath31 one gets@xmath32with the notation@xmath33for the components with @xmath34 we have the relation @xmath35 .",

    "similar to the vector potential , the fourier components for the electric and magnetic fields are presented as@xmath39where @xmath40 are the corresponding components in the problem without the cylinder and the part @xmath41 is induced by the conducting cylinder .",
    "the expressions for @xmath40 are obtained from the formulae ( [ hnz ] ) and ( [ enz ] ) by the replacement @xmath42 . the contribution in the fields induced by the cylinder comes from the second term in the right - hand side of ( [ bn ] ) .",
