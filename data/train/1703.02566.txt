    "the magnetic fields of cyg - n48 rotate smoothly from the northwest - southeast direction in the center of the core to the east - west direction in the east of the core .",

    "@xmath13 cyg - n53 : cyg - n53 is only partially resolved and hence has a round shape with a centrally concentrated peak .",
    "although cyg - n53 appears to be a single object in our sma map , 7 fragments in cyg - n53 with sizes of few thousands au have been found in the 1 mm continuum map with higher resolution @xcite .",

    "the emission between cyg - n51 and cyg - n53 is weak in the jcmt map , suggesting that cyg - n53 is more isolated than the other cores .",
    "we performed dendrograms @xcite using the _ astrodendro _ software on the jcmt and sma combined maps to characterize the structures of the cores . since all the cores are located on the ridge of the filament , we chose a lower limit of 7@xmath19 for the dendrogram to detect a structure . the required difference to separate structures of the dendrogram was set to be 1@xmath19 , and the minimum area of a structure was one synthesis beam .",

    "the procedure was repeated for 100 times , and the errors were estimated from the sample of 100 fwhm sizes and 100 @xmath21 identified by dendrograms . the size and flux of cyg - n44 selected by the dendrogram are 11.1@xmath9 and 21.4 jy , compatible with the results of 10.4@xmath9 and 18.8 jy derived from the sma map @xcite .",

    "we adopt a temperature of 20 k for the cores since herschel maps show a @xmath1 1622 k dust temperature of the cores in the dr21 filament @xcite , except a higher temperature of 30 k for the hot core cyg - n44 @xcite . assuming a radius equal to the @xmath20 of the source @xcite , the averaged column and volume density of the source are estimated as follows : @xmath33 @xmath34    the derived masses , column densities , and volume densities are listed in table [ phy_table ] , along with the errors derived from the propagation of the errors in @xmath23 and @xmath20 .",
    "although the derived errors are typically smaller than 10% , the uncertainties in the flux calibration , gas - to - dust ratio , distance , dust emissivity and more critically , the temperature may lead to an overall 30%50% uncertainty .",
    "the masses estimated from our jcmt and sma combined maps are about a factor of two to four lower than those estimated from single - dish observations @xcite , mainly because we performed dendrograms above a cutoff of 7@xmath19 to separating cores and therefore the core sizes estimated in this work are about half of the sizes in single - dish maps .      since the sma is more sensitive to small - scale magnetic fields , we computed the uncertainty - weighted averages of sma polarization angles ( @xmath35 ) to evaluate the averaged orientations of the small - scale magnetic fields of the massive dense cores .",
    "figure [ fig_pa_hist ] shows the distributions of the sma polarization angles of the cores with the derived @xmath35 listed in table [ phy_table ] .",

    "interestingly , despite that the sample of our work is small , we obtain similar conclusion as @xcite : most massive cores have small- and large - scale magnetic fields aligned within 45@xmath36 and the rest of cores have perpendicular small- and large - scale magnetic fields .",

    "however , the weak correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath21 seems to suggest that the small - scale magnetic fields are not as important as the large - scale magnetic field in supporting a core against gravity . while the either - parallel - or - perpendicular alignment appears to be a universal property from clouds to cores ,",
    "why do the alignment break below the scales of cores ? to explain the break of the either - parallel - or - perpendicular alignment , here we propose a picture that at scales above 0.1 pc , the magnetic fields are strong enough to guide the gas contraction forming structures either aligned or perpendicular to the magnetic fields .",

    "cyg - n38 and cyg - n43 both may have two groups of polarization segments in different orientations ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "the polarization segments within each group contribute low angular dispersions at small and large distances , whereas the angular dispersion measured from one group to the other group contributes a high value at an intermediate distance , resulting in the low - high - low profiles of the angular dispersion functions in cyg - n38 and cyg - n43 .",
    "in addition to the low - high - low profiles , the distributions of the data also suggest that the angular dispersion functions of cyg - n38 and cyg - n43 are resulted from the two groups of magnetic fields rather than random fields .",
    "the gray boxes in figure [ fig_adf ] represent the interquartile distributions ( 25%75% ) of the angular dispersion functions .",

    "the fitting range is from the beam to 15@xmath9 , and the parameters @xmath67 are reduced to its first order @xmath71 because the fitting range is small . due to the steep drop in the angular dispersion function of cyg - n43 , the fitting of cyg - n43 failed to converge unless the maximum fitting distance narrowed down to 10@xmath9 .",
    "although the fitting of cyg - n43 can not reproduce the angular dispersion function at large distance , the derived magnetic field strength of cyg - n43 should still be reliable , since the fitting of @xmath66 is mainly regulated by the angular dispersion at small distance and @xmath66 is the only output of the fitting required in the cf equation .",

    "the @xmath66 of the filament is 0.16 , significantly smaller than those of the cores .",
    "considering that the @xmath46 in the calculations of filament and cores are the same component of the ordered large - scale magnetic field , the increase of @xmath66 indicates an enhancement of the turbulent magnetic fields from the filament to the cores .    the derived magnetic field strengths on the plane of sky are @xmath1 0.56 mg in cyg - n38 , @xmath1 0.42 mg in cyg - n43 , @xmath1 1.71 mg in cyg - n44 , @xmath1 0.48 mg in cyg - n48 , and @xmath1 0.46 mg in cyg - n51 .",

    "since the -4.7 km s@xmath11 component is found to be associated with the cyg - n44 core and the -0.9 km s@xmath11 is the systematic velocity of the filament , the line - of - sight field strengths of cyg - n44 and the dr21 filament are suggested to be -0.36 mg and -0.71 mg , respectively @xcite .",

    "considering the assumption of the energetic equal partition and the dependance of the cf equation ( equation [ eq_cf ] ) to the density which has a 30%-50% uncertainty due to the temperature ( section 3.3 ) , we estimate that the uncertainty in the total magnetic field strength is about 50% of the value .",
