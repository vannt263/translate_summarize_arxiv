    "the geminga pulsar is the second brightest non - variable gev @xmath0-ray source in the sky and the first representative of a population of radio - quiet @xmath0-ray pulsars . since its discovery as a @xmath0-ray source by sas-2 ,",
    "more than thirty years ago @xcite , geminga has been alternatively considered as a unique object or as the prototype of a population of hidden dead stars .",
    "@xmath1 has now settled this question with the discovery @xcite of a substantial population of potentially radio - quiet pulsars , of which geminga was indeed the harbinger .",
    "+ geminga was then observed by the cos b @xmath0-ray telescope @xcite , appearing as 2cg 195 + 04 in the second cos b catalog @xcite and eventually acquiring the name geminga @xcite .",
    "the x - ray source 1e 0630 + 178 detected by the _ einstein observatory _ in the cos b error box @xcite was proposed as a possible counterpart , and subsequently an optical candidate was found within the _ einstein _ error box @xcite , which was the bluest object in the field @xcite .",
    "+ the subsequent rosat detection of periodic x - rays from this source @xcite prompted a successful search for periodicity in high - energy @xmath0 rays with egret @xcite .",
    "+ geminga has a period of 237 ms and a very stable period derivative of 1.1 @xmath6 10@xmath10 s s@xmath9 , that characterize it as a mature pulsar with characteristic age of 3 @xmath6 10@xmath11 yr and spin - down luminosity @xmath12 = 3.26 @xmath6 10@xmath13 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "+ the determination of the period derivative allowed detection of @xmath0-ray pulsations in the previous cos b @xcite and sas-2 data @xcite . meanwhile , a high proper motion of 170 mas / yr for the faint m@xmath14 = 25.5 optical counterpart was found , confirming the object to be both underluminous and no more than few hundred pc away @xcite . using hst , @xcite obtained a parallax distance for geminga of 157@xmath15 pc .",
    "a comprehensive review of the history of the identification of geminga can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ subsequently , high resolution astrometry with the _ hipparcos _ mission allowed for a 40 mas absolute positioning of geminga @xcite .",
    "such accurate positioning , together with the source proper motion , was used by @xcite to improve the quality of the timing solution of the pulsar .",
    "recent parallax and proper motion measurements confirm the earlier results , yielding a distance of 250@xmath16 pc and a proper motion of 178.2 @xmath3 0.4 mas / yr @xcite .",
    "+ analysis of egret data showed a double peaked light curve with a peak separation of @xmath17 0.5 in phase @xcite . the geminga spectrum measured by egret was compatible with a power law with a falloff at @xmath17 2 gev , but the limited egret statistics did not allow a measurement of the cut - off energy .",
    "deep x - ray observations allowed _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ to map the neutron star surface as it rotates , bringing into view different regions contributing different spectral components @xcite as well as an arcmin - scale bow - shock feature trailing the pulsar s motion @xcite .",
    "a synchrotron origin of such a non - thermal diffuse x - ray emission trailing the pulsar implies the presence of high - energy electrons ( e@xmath18 10@xmath19 ev , a value close to the upper energy limit for pulsar wind electrons in geminga ) diffusing in a 10 @xmath20 g magnetic field . +",
    "even though geminga has been one of the most intensively studied isolated neutron stars during the last thirty years , it remains of current interest , especially at @xmath0-ray energies where its narrow - peaked light curve allows precise timing studies .",
    "thus , it comes as no surprise that geminga has been a prime target for the @xmath0-ray instruments currently in operation : agile @xcite and the large area telescope ( lat ) on the @xmath1 mission @xcite . following its launch",
    ", the lat was confirmed to be an excellent instrument for pulsar studies , observing the bright vela pulsar @xcite and discovering a variety of new @xmath0-ray pulsars @xcite , including millisecond @xmath0-ray pulsars @xcite and a population of geminga - like pulsars detected with blind search techniques @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the analysis of the geminga pulsar based on the excellent statistics collected during the first year of operations of the _ fermi _ mission .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) aboard @xmath1 is an electron - positron pair conversion telescope sensitive to @xmath0 rays of energies from 20 mev to @xmath18 300 gev .",
    "the lat is made of a high - resolution silicon microstrip tracker , a csi hodoscopic electromagnetic calorimeter and an anticoincidence detector for charged particles background identification .",
    "the full description of the instrument and its performance can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ the lat has a large effective area ( peaking at @xmath178000 @xmath21 on axis ) and thanks to its field of view ( @xmath17 2.4 sr ) covers the entire sky every 2 orbits ( @xmath17 3 h ) .",
    "the lat point spread function ( psf ) strongly depends on both the energy and the conversion point in the tracker , but less on the incidence angle . for 1 gev",
    "normal incidence conversions in the upper section of the tracker the psf 68@xmath22 containment radius is 0.6 . + the data used in this paper span roughly the first year of operations after the launch of @xmath1 on 2008 june 11 .",
    "the data used for the timing analysis encompass the _ launch and early operations _ ( l@xmath23eo ) , covering @xmath17 two months after 2008 june 25 , when the lat was operated in pointing and scanning mode for check - out and calibration purposes , and extend into the first year of nominal operations up to 2009 june 15 .",
    "for the spectral analysis we selected only data collected in scanning mode , under nominal configuration , from 2008 august 4 to 2009 june 15 .",
    "we selected photons in the ` diffuse ' event class ( lowest background contamination , see * ? ? ? * ) and we excluded observations when geminga was viewed at zenith angles @xmath18 105   where earth s albedo @xmath0-rays increase the background contamination .",
    "we also excluded time intervals when the @xmath24 region of interest ( roi ) intersects the earth s albedo region .",
    "since the end of the egret mission , the geminga timing ephemeris has been maintained using occasional observations with _ xmm - newton _ ( jackson & halpern 2005 ; j. halpern , private communication ) .",
    "while agile relied on such x - ray ephemerides @xcite , lat densely - sampled , high - precision timing observations yielded an independent timing solution .",
    "in fact , the lat timing is derived from a gps clock on the spacecraft and times of arrival of @xmath0 rays are recorded with an accuracy significantly better than 1 @xmath20s @xcite .",
    "we have constructed a timing solution for geminga using the _ fermi _ lat data , exclusively . for this analysis",
    ", we assumed a constant location for the geminga pulsar calculated at the center of the time span of the lat data set ( mjd 54800 ) using the position reported by @xcite and updated according to the source proper motion @xcite .",
    "+ we determined an initial , approximate , ephemeris using an epoch - folding search .",
    "we then measured pulse times - of - arrival ( toas ) by first converting the photon event times to a reference point at the geocenter using the _ fermi _ science tool _ gtbary _",
    ", then computing a pulse profile using phases generated using tempo2 @xcite in its predictive mode .",
    "the timing accuracy of _ gtbary _ was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "this was done with @xmath25 day segments of data .",
    "toas were determined from each segment using a fourier - domain cross correlation with a high signal - to - noise template profile .",
    "we obtained 16 toas in this way from 2008 june 25 to 2009 june 15 .",
    "we fit these toas , again using tempo2 , to a model with only absolute phase , frequency and frequency first derivative as free parameters .",
    "the residuals to the model have an rms of 251@xmath20s , as shown in figure [ fig : gemresrms ] , and the model parameters are listed in table  [ tbl : ephems ] .",
    "the epoch of phase 0.0 given in table  [ tbl : ephems ] is defined so that the phase of the first component of the fourier transform of the light curve has 0 phase . however , in order to assign a smaller phase to the leading peak , we introduced an additional phase shift of 0.5 to the timing solution in table  [ tbl : ephems ] .",
