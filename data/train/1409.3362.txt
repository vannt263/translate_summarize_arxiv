    "lots of least squares methods have been extensively studied for the efficient and accurate numerical approximation of many partial differential equations such as the elliptic , elasticity and stokes equations . as mentioned in @xcite",
    ", there are three kinds of least - squares methods : the inverse approach , the div approach , and the div - curl approach .",
    "the interest of this paper is to consider the div approach least squares method which applies a chosen @xmath4 norm to a natural first order system for the helmholtz equation with robin boundary condition which is the first order approximation of the radiation condition :    [ hwn_pde ] @xmath7    where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is a bounded , lipschitz and connected domain , the wave number @xmath0 is real and positive , and @xmath10 denotes the imaginary unit .",
    "we want to point out that if the sign before @xmath11 in ( [ hwn_pde2 ] ) is positive , the corresponding least squares method and theoretical analysis in this paper also hold .",
    "we impose further assumptions on the domain @xmath12 in the following :    1 .",
    "there is a constant @xmath13 such that for any @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the helmholtz equation ( [ hwn_pde ] ) has a unique solution @xmath16 satisfying @xmath17 2 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath12 is analytic .",
    "the above assumptions are intrinsic for the analysis in this paper , while the least squares method can be applied for more general cases .",
    "in fact , @xcite shows the assumption ( a1 ) holds if the domain @xmath12 is star - shaped ; and ( * ? ? ? * theorem  @xmath18 ) obtains the same estimate without the star - shaped restriction .    due to the well - known pollution effect for the numerical solution of the helmholtz equation",
    ", the standard galerkin finite element methods can maintain a desired accuracy only if the mesh resolution is appropriately increased .",
    "numerous nonstandard methods have been proposed in the literature to obtain more stable and accurate approximation , which includes quasi - stabilized finite element methods @xcite , absolutely stable discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods @xcite , continuous interior penalty finite element methods @xcite , the partition of unity finite element methods @xcite , the ultra weak variational formulation @xcite , plane wave dg methods @xcite , spectral methods @xcite , generalized galerkin / finite element methods @xcite , meshless methods @xcite , and the geometrical optics approach @xcite .    generally , the linear systems from most of the above nonstandard galerkin finite element approximations of the helmholtz equation with high wave number @xmath0 are strongly indefinite .",
    "but the least - squares galerkin method for the helmholtz equation always yields a hermitian positive definite system @xcite .",
    "hence it attracts the design of an efficient solver .",
    "for instance , a div - curl approach least squares method was applied to the helmholtz equation in @xcite , and an efficient solver based on wave - ray multigrid was proposed .",
    "recently , numerical results in @xcite show that a multiplicative schwarz algorithm , without coarse solver , provides a @xmath3-preconditioner for solving the dpg system .",
    "the numerical observations suggest that the condition number of the preconditioned system is independent of the wavenumber @xmath0 and the polynomial degree @xmath3 . since both dpg methods and fosls are residual minimization methods such that their linear systems are hermitian positive definite , it is promising that the multiplicative schwarz preconditioner in @xcite will provide similar preconditioning for fosls .",
    "we will show the effect of the multiplicative schwarz preconditioner for our fosls in a separate paper .    a key result revealed by j.m .",
    "melenk and s.  sauter in @xcite is that the polynomial degree @xmath3 should be chosen in a wavenumber - dependent way to yield optimal convergent conditions .",
    "this important result was analyzed based on the standard galerkin finite element method .",
    "it shows that , under the assumption that the solution operator for helmholtz problems is polynomially bounded in @xmath0 , quasi optimal convergence can be obtained under the conditions that @xmath5 is sufficiently small and the polynomial degree @xmath3 is at least @xmath19 .",
    "an objective of this paper is to extend the key result in @xcite to the div approach fosls method , which will be called fosls method for brevity in the following .",
    "we use the standard raviart - thomas finite element space and continuous piece - wise polynomial finite element space for the discretization of the fosls method .",
    "the stability of the fosls solutions for the helmholtz equation can be obtained by the property of fosls formulation and a rellich - type identity approach .",
    "the main difficulty in the analysis lies in the establishment of quasi optimal convergence for the fosls method .",
    "we first mimic the technique proposed in @xcite to decompose the helmholtz solution into an oscillatory analytic part and a nonoscillatory elliptic part . a key estimate for the oscillatory analytic part of the helmholtz solution ( cf .",
    "( [ decomp_ineq3 ] ) in theorem  [ thm_divergence_regularity ] ) is further derived for the error analysis of the fosls method for the helmholtz equation .",
    "another crucial estimate lies in the derivation of the dependence of convergence on the polynomial degree @xmath3 .",
    "a new @xmath20 projection is designed to overcome this problem , and some important estimates , which reveal the dependence of the projection error on @xmath21 , for this @xmath20 projection are obtained . in remark",
    "[ remark_rt ] , we explain why it is necessary to use raviart - thomas space instead of vector valued continuous piece - wise polynomial space to approximate vector fields in @xmath22 . in remark  [ remark_div_space ] , we give detailed explanation why the projection - based interpolation in @xcite can _ not _ be applied for the quasi optimal convergent estimate for the helmholtz equation .",
    "the most important part of the analysis lies in a modified duality argument for the fosls method which is motivated by the duality argument used in @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "the corresponding dual fosls problem is to find @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 here , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the numerical approximation to @xmath27 .",
    "then , the regularity estimates for the oscillatory analytic part @xmath28 and the nonoscillatory elliptic part @xmath29 of the solution of the above dual fosls problem are deduced . since the above dual fosls problem is quite different from the dual problem used in @xcite , these regularity estimates , especially the estimate of @xmath30 ( cf .",
    "( [ test_func_ineq5 ] ) in lemma  [ lemma_test_function ] ) , gets involved with non - trivial modification to the original proof of solution decomposition in @xcite .",
    "finally the quasi optimality of the @xmath4 norm error estimate for the scalar solution of the fosls method for the helmholtz equation can be finally obtained under the conditions that @xmath5 is sufficiently small and the polynomial degree @xmath3 is at least @xmath31 .",
    "we want to emphasize that fosls is closely related to the discontinuous petrov - galerkin ( dpg ) methods , see @xcite .",
    "recently , the dpg@xmath32 method , which is of the least - squares type , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the dpg@xmath32 solution may yield less pollution error than the general fosls with fixed polynomial degree @xmath3 and on the same mesh .",
    "the analysis for fosls in this paper can be useful to develop and analyze pollution free dpg methods .",
    "in addition , the implementation of dpg methods have been significantly simplified in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : we introduce some notation , the fosls method , and the main result in the next section .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the proof of the stability estimate of the fosls method for the helmholtz equation . in section 4",
    ", we present some auxiliary results for the regularity estimates of the oscillatory analytic part and the nonoscillatory elliptic part of the helmholtz solution , and the approximation properties of the finite element spaces .",
    "the regularity estimates of the solution to the dual fosls problem and the proof of a quasi optimal convergent result of this paper are stated in section 5 . in the final section",
    ", we give some numerical results to confirm our theoretical analysis .",
    "we describe the meshes we are going to use .",
    "we first introduce the concept of generalized cell .",
