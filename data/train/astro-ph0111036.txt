    "in the 940 ks exposure ( hereafter 1ms ) of the chandra deep field south ( giacconi et al . 2001 ; tozzi et al . 2001 ; rosati et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter paper i , ii and iii ) we reached an on  axis flux limit of @xmath5 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 and @xmath7 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 in the hard ( 210 kev ) and soft ( 0.52 kev ) band respectively .",
    "this is the deepest x  ray exposure to date together with the 1 megasec exposure reached in the hubble deep field north by the penn state university group ( see hornschemeier et al .",
    "2000 ; 2001 ; brandt et al .",
    "these , and other deep fields of few @xmath8 sec , are now public in the chandra archive .",
    "to these deep looks into the x  ray sky , we can add the 100 ksec observation of the lockman hole with xmm ( hasinger et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in these proceedings",
    "we summarize the results from the x  ray data of the cdfs , namely the soft and hard counts , the contribution to the x  ray background ( xrb ) , and some x - ray spectral properties of the sample .",
    "we will also compare the results of the cdfs with other deep fields .",
    "finally , we will briefly discuss the properties of the intra cluster medium ( icm ) detected in high@xmath9 clusters of galaxies .",
    "this is just a quick look through the window opened by chandra and xmm on the high  z , x  ray sky .",
    "the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) data have been obtained by adding 11 pointings of the chandra satellite from october 1999 to december 2000 . the pointings had different roll angles , enabling a total coverage of 0.1089 deg@xmath3 .",
    "the data were reduced with the standard software developed at the cfa ( ciao release v1.5 , see http://asc.harvard.edu/cda ) and the source detection process is described in detail in papers i and ii .",
    "the energy fluxes are obtained from the observed net count  rates using a count  rate to flux conversion factors for an average photon index @xmath10 and a galactic absorbing column of @xmath11 @xmath6 .",
    "the conversion factors are @xmath12 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 per count s@xmath2 , and @xmath13 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 per count @xmath14 in the soft and in the hard band respectively .",
    "the source count rates are corrected for vignetting and varying exposure time across the field .    in the soft band",
    "the differential counts are well fitted by a double power law which is consistent with the euclidean slope at the bright end and with a slope @xmath15 ( 1 sigma error ) at the faint end , with a break at @xmath16 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 ( see paper iii ) .",
    "thus , below @xmath17 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 , the slope of the cumulative number counts is @xmath18 ( see figure [ fig1 ] , left ) , showing that we are about to saturate the xrb . in the 12 kev band",
    "we find a resolved contribution of @xmath19 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 deg@xmath20 for fluxes lower than @xmath21 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 , corresponding to @xmath22% of the unresolved flux measured by rosat ( which is @xmath23 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 , see hasinger et al .",
    "if this value is summed to the contribution at higher fluxes , we estimate a total contribution of @xmath24 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 deg@xmath20 for fluxes larger than @xmath25 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 ( which is our flux limit in the 12 kev band ) , corresponding to 83% of the unresolved value .    in the hard counts too , we find evidence for progressive flattening : the differential counts are well fitted by a power law which is consistent with the euclidean slope at the bright end and with a slope @xmath26 ( 1 sigma ) at the faint end , with a break at @xmath27 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 ( see figure [ fig1 ] , right ) .",
    "the integrated contribution of all the sources within the flux range @xmath28 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 to @xmath29 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 in the 210 kev band is @xmath30 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 deg@xmath20 for @xmath31 . after including the bright end seen by asca for @xmath32 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 ( della ceca et al .",
    "2000 ) , the total resolved hard x  ray background amounts to @xmath33 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 deg@xmath20 . in figure [ fig2 ] ( left )",
    "we show the total contribution computed from the cdfs plus asca sample .",
    "the value at the limiting flux has now reached the value of the unresolved xrb @xmath34 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 deg@xmath20 from uhuru and heao-1 ( marshall et al .",
    "more recent values of the 210 kev integrated flux from the bepposax and asca surveys appear higher by 20 - 40% .",
    "thus a fraction between 0.98 and 0.65 of the total xrb flux value has now been resolved into discrete sources .",
    "the stacked spectrum of the sources of the total sample is well fitted by a power law with a photon index @xmath35 ( errors refer to the 90% confidence level ) with @xmath36 for a column density fixed to the galactic value @xmath37 @xmath6 .",
    "the average spectrum is consistent with the shape of the unresolved hard background @xmath38 , confirming previous findings .",
    "however , we notice that the average spectrum of the sources is harder at low fluxes . to investigate this behaviour , we divided the sample of sources detected in the hard band in 4 subsamples : bright ( @xmath39 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 ) , medium ( @xmath40 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 ) , faint ( @xmath41 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 ) , and very faint ( @xmath42 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 ) . the average slope of the stacked spectra is @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 respectively ( figure [ fig2 ] , right ) .",
    "these data show the emergence of the hard population at faint fluxes , which resolves the so called _",
    "spectral paradox_. in fact , the spectrum of the sources detected from previous x  ray missions ( namely rosat and asca ) at fluxes brighter than @xmath28 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 , showed a spectral slope of @xmath47 .",
    "chandra and xmm have now made possible the direct detection of a population , of absorbed ( typeii ) agns with hard ",
    "band luminosities in the range @xmath48 erg s@xmath2 , building up the flat spectrum ( @xmath10 ) of the xrb .",
    "softer sources appear to span the range from @xmath49 to @xmath50 erg s@xmath2 . at luminosities larger than @xmath51 erg s@xmath2 in the soft band ,",
    "these sources are mostly identified with typei agn . at the low luminosity end",
    ", several sources are detected only in the soft band and are identified with normal galaxies at redshifts less than @xmath52 , with luminosities restricted to @xmath53 erg s@xmath2 ( see also hornschemeier et al .",
    "such luminosities may be due to a combination of low  level nuclear activity , a population of low mass x ",
    "ray binaries , and thermal emission from hot halos .",
    "in the cdfs the normalization @xmath54 ( computed at @xmath55 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 ) for the hard counts is @xmath56% lower than that in the hawaii deep field ( mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ; see the inset of figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the difference is statistically significant despite the small area of the hawaii df ( see paper i and ii ) .",
    "therefore we investigated if we must revise upwards the fraction of the resolved xrb in the cdfs . to understand the nature of this discrepancy",
    ", we analyzed the acis  s chip of the hawaii df with our procedure .",
    "we found the same normalization of the number counts , confirming that the mentioned discrepancy is not due to calibration or detection technique .    to investigate further this issue and estimate the occurence of this high normalization",
    ", we analyzed two acis ",
    "i , public chandra fields , the lynx ( stern et al . 2001 ) , and the ms1137 field . in the first case we found perfect agreement with the cdfs results ( see stern et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the second case",
    ", we found the same `` excess '' of the 0.025 deg@xmath3 of the hawaii df , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] ( left ) .",
    "however , the excess is given mainly by two chips where the density of sources is significantly larger ( figure [ fig3 ] , right ) .",
    "the remaining properties of this field are perfectly consistent with the cdfs , for example the stacked spectrum of the sources is well fitted by a power law with @xmath57 , with the local absorption fixed to the galactic value of @xmath58 @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we find again evidence for positive fluctuations of the hard sources on @xmath59 arcmin scale .",
    "this positive fluctuations maybe due to clustering of the hard sources .",
    "it is noteworth to mention that the same effect is not found in the soft band .",
    "in fact , we already know that most of the hard sources are in a limited range of redshifts around 1 , while the soft sources span a very large range ( see paper ii ) , washing out possible effects of clustering .    how much do these positive fluctuations alter our estimate of the resolved xrb ? to summarize our investigation of chandra deep fields to date , we have 0.33 deg@xmath3 with a consistent normalization ( cdfs , cdfn , lynx , lockman hole ) , and 0.089 deg@xmath3 with a @xmath56% higher normalization ( hawaii df , ms1137 field ) . considering a 40% higher contribution on 20% of the sky , the resolved contribution in the investigated flux range ( @xmath60 er s@xmath61 @xmath6 ) rises to ( @xmath62 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 deg@xmath20 .",
    "this would bring the total resolved value for @xmath63 to @xmath64 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 deg@xmath20 .",
    "this value is @xmath65 7% higher than the cdfs value , but still within the estimated error .",
    "another important population of objects in the cdfs , despite its small solid angle , is constituted by groups and clusters of galaxies . the systematic search for extended source found about 20 detections , including diffuse halos around elliptical galaxies . here",
    "we focus on the three brightest extended sources detected at the level of @xmath66 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 and associated to groups of galaxies .",
    "we have redshift for the brightest cluster member of one of them ( @xmath67 ) , while the optical colors of the others are consistent with being moderate  redshift poor clusters or groups .",
    "the stacked spectrum is well fitted by a raymond ",
    "smith thermal spectrum with temperature @xmath68 kev and a metallicity of @xmath69 , after assuming an average redshift of @xmath70 .",
    "the luminosities are in the range @xmath71 erg s@xmath2 in the soft band . to this small sample , we can add the three clusters found in the lynx field at redshifts 0.57 and 1.26 and 1.27 ( holden et al .",
    "2001 , stanford et al . 2001 ) , and the cluster ms1137 at @xmath72 . if we plot these clusters in the @xmath73@xmath74 plane , together with other two objects from the literature ( see borgani et al .",
    "2001 ) , we find that these sources are consistent with the local @xmath73@xmath74 relation .",
    "this confirms the finding of lack of evolution in the @xmath73@xmath74 relation ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 ) up to @xmath75 .",
    "this behaviour is expected on the basis of pre  heating models for the icm ( see , e.g. , tozzi & norman 2001 ) .",
    "in these proceedings we reviewed some of the results from the 1ms exposure of the cdfs ( rosati et al .",
    "we reached a flux limit of @xmath76 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 in the 0.52 kev soft band and @xmath77 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 in the 210 kev hard band .",
    "for the hard counts , after the inclusion of the asca sources at the bright end , the total contribution to the resolved hard x  ray background down to our flux limit now amounts to @xmath78 erg @xmath6 s@xmath2 deg@xmath20 . with this new data we resolved @xmath79 of the hard xrb ,",
    "given the uncertainties in the unresolved value , which ranges from @xmath80 to @xmath81 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 deg@xmath20 .",
    "the general properties of the x  ray background are now well established .",
    "we confirm the finding of a progressive hardening of the sources at lower fluxes , both for the soft and the hard samples .",
    "in particular , we divided the hard sample into four subsamples and found average power laws of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 for the bright , medium , faint and very faint subsample respectively .",
    "the progressive hardening at faint fluxes is probably due to a stronger intrinsic absorption .",
    "the so called `` spectral paradox '' is solved by a hard , faint population of sources constituted mostly by nearby ( @xmath86 ) absorbed ( type ii ) agn with hard luminosities @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "comparison with other deep fields from chandra , shows that the agn found in the cdfs are representative of the agn population as a whole .",
    "some fields have a @xmath56% higher normalization probably due to clustering of nearby , hard sources .",
    "this excess , averaged over the 6 deep fields mentioned and briefly reviewed here , can result in an upward revision of the value of the resolved xrb of about 7% .",
    "we reviewed also the spectral analysis of the three brightest extended sources detected in the cdfs .",
    "they are associated with moderate redshift groups of galaxies ( @xmath87 ) and their average spectrum is well fitted by a raymond ",
    "smith model with a temperature of @xmath88 kev .",
    "this result , added to the three clusters found in the lynx field , the cluster ms1137 and other two objects from the literature ( see borgani et al .",
    "2001 ) , shows that there is no hints of evolution of the @xmath73@xmath74 relation up to @xmath89 .",
    "this behaviour is expected in preheating model for the icm .",
    "the results on agns and clusters reviewed here , give an example of the high  quality performance of the chandra satellite .",
    "in particular , the growing number of deep fields in the chandra archive will permit a detailed exploration of the @xmath4 universe in x  rays .",
