    "multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disorder of unknown origin that damages the myelin , a fatty layer that envelops and protects the axons .",
    "the damage of the myelin causes neuron electrical impulses to travel slowly along their axons , leading to a variety of symptoms with debilitating consequences .",
    "the repeated damage of the myelin causes the loss of the remyelination capacity of oligodendrocytes and produces scar - like lesions around damaged axons . from a clinical point of view , these lesions are demonstrated to be localised in the white matter and to be venocentric ( i.e. these plaques are always found around venules ) .",
    "recent clinical evidence suggests an association of ms with ccsvi [ zamboni , 2006 ; singh and zamboni , 2009 ; zamboni et al . ,",
    "however , the evolution of the process from venous stenosis to local hypertension and leakage of hematic substance , which may trigger the immune response as ultimate cause of demyelination and neurodegeneration typical of ms has been the subject of an intense debate with often opposed views .",
    "this is a controversial hypothesis , yet it is consistent with the predominantly venocentric orientation of the ms inflammatory lesions and with the otherwise unexplained perivenular iron deposition observed in many clinical cases [ adams , 1988 ] .",
    "a possible path connecting cerebrospinal venous stenosis to chronic fatigue and ms was proposed by tucker [ 2011 ] on the basis of qualitative considerations of elementary fluid mechanics .    from a physiological point of view",
    ", the microvessel wall plays an important role in maintaining the equilibrium between intravascular and extravascular fluid compartments . under normal conditions the vessel walls are nearly impermeable to macromolecules , while lipophilic species and small hydrophilic substances are allowed to cross the wall and reach the surrounding tissue .",
    "fluid flow and transport of dissolved molecules across the walls depend on the permeability and diffusivity of the membrane composing the wall .",
    "therefore , alterations of the blood pressure may lead to impaired exchange processes and , in extreme cases , to leakage of hematic fluid .",
    "several alterations of these exchange processes have been observed , mainly in compartments other than the brain , resulting in leakage of macromolecules , which is typically attributed to reduction of osmotic pressure , or inflammatory processes that alter the endothelial structure .    in the present work we investigate the role of an altered blood pressure as the driving force for alteration of the exchange processes and the leakage of macromolecules . in particular , we analyze through a simplified , yet realistic , flow and transport model , the impact of alterations in the hydrostatic blood pressure on transport of molecules across the microvessel wall .",
    "the microvessel wall is assumed to be composed of two layers with different permeability and porosity , as assumed in previous studies on fluid flow and macromolecules transport in heteroporous membranes .",
    "the inner layer represents the glycocalyx , a membrane composed of extracellular polymeric material which is believed to exert an important sieving effect on macromolecules , while the external layer represents the combined effect of the endothelial cells , the basal membrane and the external astrocyte feet .    with this model",
    "we obtain closed - form steady - state solutions for the fluid flow and solute transport through the microvessel walls , which can be used for a preliminary analysis of the leakage of macromolecules due to an increase of blood pressure in ccsvi / ms patients .",
    "in this section we summarise anatomic features of mammalian blood vessels useful to describe the geometry of the computational domain used in the present work .",
    "the circulatory system is composed by vessels of size ranging from centimetres in the main ones to a few microns in the capillary bed .",
    "the structure of the vessel wall differs between arteries and veins and also between large vessels and capillaries .",
    "each segment of circulation shows an optimal combination of size , wall composition , thickness and cross - sectional area that best fulfils its function .",
    "for example , arteries are more muscular than veins because they have to bear the pumping force of the heart .",
    "large vessels are formed of three layers : the endothelium , the middle layer composed by smooth muscle cells and the connective layer . on the contrary ,",
    "small vessels such as capillaries , venules and arterioles are only one - cell thick , in order to optimize the exchange of small hydrophilic molecules from the blood stream to the interstitial volume before crossing the cell membrane .",
    "molecules dissolved in water are driven through the vessel wall by the gradient of the net pressure @xmath0 , which is given by the difference between the hydrostatic @xmath1 and osmotic @xmath2 pressure : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the reflection coefficient .",
    "@xmath4 depends on the ratio between the stokes radius of the molecule and the pore radius , or the size of the cleft between adjacent endothelial cells . when the size of the molecule is comparable with the pore size ( or the aperture )",
    ", the vessel wall behaves as a perfect membrane and @xmath5 . on the other hand , when the molecules are much smaller than the pore size , the membrane effect vanishes and @xmath6 . in the latter case , transport across the vessel wall",
    "is controlled by the gradient of the hydrostatic pressure . for a given pore ( or cleft )",
    "size , the role of the osmotic pressure increases with the size of molecule . in the present work we consider two layers , one represented by the glycocalyx and the other by the cleft .",
    "the sieving effect of glycocalyx on macromolecules is represented by a @xmath4 value that approaches 1 , while in the stratum representing the endothelial cells @xmath4 is typically smaller , to reflect the larger aperture of the tight junctions connecting the two sides of the cleft at the border between adjacent cells [ levick , 2010 ] .",
    "let us approximate the microvessel geometry as a rigid circular cylinder , infinitely long in the @xmath7-direction , i.e. in the direction of the blood stream .",
    "we assume the vessel wall composed by one or more permeable layers of a given thickness .",
    "physical properties , such as permeability and molecular diffusion are assumed constant within a layer , but may vary across the layers .",
    "the porosity is assumed the same in all layers .",
    "molecules of a given stokes radius are dissolved into the blood plasma at a concentration that does not modify its density and viscosity .",
    "furthermore , to simplify the analysis we assume that the pressure gradient is small in the longitudinal direction , such that blood flow through the vessel lumen can be decoupled from the filtration through its wall . in general , the osmotic pressure changes with the solute concentration @xmath8 . for small concentrations ,",
    "the following linear relationship is often considered : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a parameter that depends on the stokes radius of the molecule , @xmath11 is the gas constant and @xmath12 is the absolute temperature . consequently , the flow and transport equations are coupled through the concentration @xmath8 that feeds back through @xmath2 to the flow .",
    "this leads levick and michel [ 2010 ] to conclude that microvessels can not absorb fluid from the interstitial space , as is often argued .",
    "however , this feedback is important mainly when hydrostatic pressure is abruptly reduced , as in the landis experiment @xcite , whereas here we are interested in the increase of hydrostatic pressure .",
    "we therefore neglect this feedback and solve the flow and transport equations separately .    under the above assumptions ,",
    "mass balance of the solvent and the solute leads to the following governing equations for the pressure @xmath13 @xmath14 and for the concentration @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the wall permeability , @xmath18 is the blood density , @xmath19 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath20 is the blood dynamic viscosity , @xmath21 is the specific storage of the porous material , @xmath22 is the porosity of the material and @xmath23 is the diffusion tensor .",

    "the steady - state equations for the solvent and for the solute in cylindrical coordinates assume the following form @xmath38      we now consider a geometrical situation as depicted in figure [ fig3](a ) , which shows a cylinder whose inner surface of the endothelial cells is represented by radius @xmath39 and whose outer wall is determined by radius @xmath40 .",
