    "recirculating linac accelerators ( rlas ) make use of multiple passes of an electron bunch through the same linac ( or set of linacs ) to obtain high particle energies @xcite .",
    "this principle has been demonstrated in the 6 ( soon 12 ) gev cebaf accelerator @xcite , and has been proposed both for the acceleration of muons for a neutrino factory @xcite and for the generation of high - current , low - emittance beams for electron - proton collisions @xcite . at sufficiently high beam powers",
    "it becomes desirable to recover the energy from the electrons by decelerating them , usually ( but not originally @xcite ) in the same structures used for acceleration .",
    "the energy recovery linac ( erl ) has therefore been proposed for applications where an unrecovered beam power would be prohibitive , either limited by the maximum power that can be directed to a beam dump , or by the more prosaic electrical cost limitation in driving a high power particle beam @xcite .    presently , the most common proposed application of the erl is in photon science , either generating low - emittance , high current synchrotron radiation at large electron energies ( typically greater than 1  gev ) @xcite , or generating high power free - electron laser ( fel ) radiation at lower energies ( typically 100 to 200  mev ) @xcite .",
    "beam currents greater than 1  ma are often considered , and sometimes proposed to be as high as 100  ma @xcite .",
    "storage rings by comparison are limited by the equilibrium emittance between radiation damping and quantum excitation .",
    "free - electron laser facilities such as flash and lcls that are driven by linacs and which do not use energy recovery are intrinsically limited to lower repetition rates due to their beam power , and which limits the science that may be performed at them ; erl upgrades have been proposed as a way to overcome this @xcite .",
    "other proposals have considered the use of rlas to reduce the capital cost required to reach a given electron energy @xcite .",
    "recovery of the energy from the electron bunches is only worthwhile if there is little concomitant power loss in the cavities themselves , and this leads naturally to the use of superconducting cavities in most ( but not all @xcite ) existing and planned erls .",
    "both rlas and erls require control of the time of flight ( tof ) of successive passes of a particular particle bunch so that the desired phase is seen on each pass with respect to the on - crest value of the cavities .",
    "in particular , energy - recovery linacs ( erls ) must carefully control the phase of the returning bunches so that they have approximately a @xmath0 phase difference with respect to the phase seen on the accelerating pass .",
    "accurate phase control is required not just to decelerate the bunches but also to manage instabilities @xcite , the optimal phase difference between accelerating and decelerating passes typically being slightly away from @xmath0 to minimise the final energy spread of the decelerated bunches @xcite .",
    "based on the extensive experience at jefferson laboratory and from the tesla linear collider project , the most commonly - considered frequencies for erl cavities are 1.3 and 1.5  ghz @xcite . the required tof adjustment required in erls is therefore typically no more than 770  ps ( @xmath1 at 1.3  ghz , whose wavelength is 23  cm ) , and this sets the scale for what adjustment systems have to provide .",
    "in erls that circulate electrons , @xmath2 for all practical purposes , so tof adjustment by changing particle velocity is not practicable ; instead the actual path length that the electrons see is changed .",
    "the path length change may be achieved either magnetically or mechanically : both types have been constructed and operated . in the following discussion we use the sign convention that an arc with positive dispersion everywhere has a negative @xmath3 term in its total first - order transfer matrix , whereas the common four - dipole chicane used in bunch compressors has a positive @xmath3 .",
    "we label these a - type ( arc - like , @xmath4 ) , and b - type ( bunch - compressor - like , @xmath5 ) .",
    "the prototypical magnetic adjustment design is the so - called bates bend , which uses a five - dipole arrangement in which a four - dipole chicane is effectively split into two halves by inserting a @xmath0-bend dipole in the middle @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 bend has @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the bending radius ) . by appropriate choice of bend and separation of the half - chicanes ( doglegs )",
    "the negative @xmath3 from the @xmath0 bend cancels with the positive @xmath3 in the doglegs to make the entire system isochronous . assuming that the dogleg dipoles have the same bend radius as the main dipole , the isochronous condition is obtained when the spacing between the dipoles in each dogleg is    @xmath8 + 2 \\text{cos}[2 \\theta ] ) \\text{cosec}[\\theta ] \\text{sec}[\\theta ]   \\\\   & - & \\frac{1}{2 } \\text{cosec}[\\theta ] ^3 \\text{sec}[\\theta ] \\times \\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\sqrt{\\rho ^2 \\text{sin}[\\theta ] ^3 ( -2 \\text{cos}[\\theta ] ( \\pi + 4 \\theta -4 \\text{sin}[\\theta ] ) + 9 \\text{sin}[\\theta ] ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the bend angle in each dogleg dipole , and we assume that the distances between the inner dogleg dipoles and the @xmath0 bend are small . for the special case of @xmath10 this expression",
    "reduces to @xmath11 in other words , the length / width ratio of a bates bend is essentially independent of the bend radius , so to reduce its length the bend radius must also be reduced . in practical designs @xmath9",
    "is set to smaller values nearer to 20@xmath12 to minimise aberrations @xcite but a shape scaling still applies .    to adjust the path length in a bates system a pair of small dipoles each upstream and downstream of the @xmath0 bend provide symmetrical kicks of angle @xmath13 to the beam . to understand the effect on the path length we recall the basic equation for path length change through an arbitrary first - order system due to a change in initial position and angle , @xmath14 in a dipole magnet of length @xmath15 and bend angle @xmath16",
    "this becomes @xmath17 applying a symmetric condition in the incoming and outgoing @xmath18 and @xmath13 in the dipole gives @xmath19 so that @xmath20 these conditions hold for any dipoles , so that in principle bend angles less than @xmath0 may be used to adjust the total path length magnetically , for example by applying an appropriate adjustment of position and angle in the central dipole of a triple - bend achromat ( tba ) , which in general requires four correctors and which will result in some optical cross - talk .",
    "however , in the special case of @xmath21 in the bates bend we have @xmath22 : only two correctors are required , and there is little optical cross - talk . also , the additional aperture required to accommodate the path - adjusted trajectory is only in the central dipole , and not in other elements .    whilst the bates bend scheme is suitable for lower - energy electrons , it is not appropriate for use at the gev - scale energies needed for shorter - wavelength x - ray production as the @xmath0 bend becomes impracticably large .",
    "for example at a field strength of @xmath23  t the @xmath0-bend for 1  gev electron beam would be 7  m in length .",
    "m bend radius dipoles.,width=302 ]",
    "guignard  @xcite showed that a triple - bend achromat ( tba ) contains the minimum number of dipoles necessary for isochronous transport - this is done by driving the dispersion to a negative value in the central dipole using the intervening quadrupoles .",
    "this method has been used in jaeri  @xcite and alice ( formerly erlp )  @xcite . to produce a variable path length difference ,",
    "the entire arc must be moved with respect to the rest of the accelerator in a manner analogous to the motion of a trombone . at alice",
    "we have implemented such a moving arc with good position and therefore phase accuracy : this is shown schematically in figure [ fig : alicearcschematic ] .",
    "we have measured good longitudinal and angular stability of the arc under motion ( with reproducibility of longitudinal position of around 40  @xmath24 m at each end of the arc ) , giving an effective precision of setting the return bunch phase well under the required 1@xmath12 accuracy needed to obtain efficient energy recovery .",
    "in addition , the effect of the expanding expanding drift spaces on the transverse focusing is small , with estimated relative changes of the twiss functions of order 20% over the 23  cm range of motion .    ; the overall arc width is a little over 5  m. three linear bearings are used with a single motor drive to adjust the longitudinal position of the arc with a measured precision of around 40  @xmath24 m , equivalent to a phase accuracy of 0.125@xmath12.,width=264 ]        whilst good accuracy has been demonstrated for small arcs such as at alice , it is impractical to scale this method up to the gev scale whilst keeping the bending dipoles at reasonable strength , due to the difficulty both of achieving as good position tolerances in , and of moving the increased mass of , a larger arc .",
    "at large beam energies the use of both geometric adjustment and the bates bend are precluded , and so we need an alternative method .",
    "many erl projects implicitly assume that path length adjustment is performed using an orbit perturbation in the arcs ( see for example discussion in reference @xcite ) ; for sufficiently - large arc sizes this perturbation will be small , but there will always be some effect on the transverse optics .",
    "we feel this unnecessarily complicates a recirculating linac design .",
    "wiggler magnets may be used in situations where longitudinal dispersion change is not as important , for example as proposed in the clic ctf3 facility  @xcite where they propose variable - field , one - period wiggler magnets to introduce a path length change .",
    "this system is compact with a @xmath25  m length , but the path length variation achieved is small at @xmath26  mm for a field variation of @xmath27% .    in a @xmath28",
    "ghz rla we require a path length change of @xmath29  cm .",
    "a wiggler @xmath30  m long with dipoles of variable field from 0  t to 1  t would introduce sufficient change in the path length , but would also generate an @xmath3 that varies linearly with the path correction . at @xmath31  cm , @xmath32  cm . in principle",
    "this can be corrected elsewhere in the lattice @xcite , but this is still a cross - talk that is desirable to avoid .",
    "given the drawbacks of existing path correction methods presently applied to high - energy electrons , we consider what can be achieved in a modular system .",
    "we begin by extending the well - known derivation of the compression provided by a four - dipole chicane , using the hard - edged approximation .",
    "we consider four identical dipoles bending in the horizontal plane with no internal focusing and no edge focusing ( in other words normal entry and exit from the dipoles ) .    in terms of the length @xmath33 and",
    "bend angle @xmath9 of each dipole , we recall the dipole transfer matrix is @xmath34 and the drift matrix has its usual form given determined by its length @xmath35 . composing the transfer matrix for the whole chicane is simply @xmath36    explicitly expanding the total longitudinal dispersion @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 \\sin^3\\theta\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{0.2in}+\\left(2 l_d-\\frac{l_d^3 \\theta ^2}{l_b^2}\\right ) \\sin^4\\theta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our subsequent calculations we use this exact expression , however it is illustrative to expand it as a power series in @xmath9 to yield @xmath39 ^ 8\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term is the well - known approximation for small angles  @xcite .    up",
    "to second order in @xmath9 , the complete transfer matrix is    @xmath40 ^ 3 \\\\ r_{21 } & r_{22 } & 0 & 0 & 0 & o[\\theta ] ^3 \\\\   0 & 0 & 1 & 4 l_b+3 l_d & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\   o[\\theta ] ^3 & o[\\theta ] ^3 & 0 & 0 & 1 & r_{56 } \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath41 ^ 3   \\nonumber\\\\ r_{12 } & = &   \\left(4 l_b+3 l_d\\right)-\\left(\\frac{32 l_b}{3}+14 l_d+\\frac{4 l_d^2}{l_b}\\right ) \\theta ^2+o[\\theta ]",

    "we illustrate this by considering the limit as @xmath42 , @xmath43 this ratio is shown in figure  [ fig : seriescorrection ] , and shows that the second - order approximation is accurate to 10% for bend angles up to @xmath44 18@xmath12 ; the exact expression for @xmath45 is therefore needed for bend angles greater than this .     as a function of chicane bend angle . ]",
    "we next consider a similar four - dipole chicane , except in this case with a pair of quadrupoles inserted into each of the angled sections of the chicane . to suppress dispersion at the centre of the chicane",
    "the well - known scheme is used of placing the quadrupoles of each pair @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the way along each angled section , to give a back - to - back pair of doglegs with zero dispersion at each end , and zero dispersion at the centre . the total longitudinal dispersion for this focused chicane",
    "may be expressed , using a thin lens approximation for the quadrupoles , as @xmath48\\,\\,\\left.\\rule{0pt}{15pt}\\right\\ } ,    \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the focal length of each f - quadrupole , @xmath33 is the length of the dipoles and @xmath35 is the drift space length between the dipoles into which each quadrupole pair is placed . with sufficiently - strong quadrupoles the overall longitudinal dispersion may be made negative , in contrast to the conventional chicane where it is always positive .",
    "an additional ( vertically - focusing ) quadrupole is placed at the centre of each dogleg to allow control of the betatron functions through the complete chicane .",
    "we now combine the two chicanes - one focusing , one without focusing - into a single path corrector module .",
    "the two doglegs from which the focusing chicane is constructed are allowed to move on rails so that the angle of each dogleg may vary from zero degrees upwards , the dipole magnets being adjusted to direct the particle beam at the correct angle .",
    "a set of bellows connects the two doglegs together , and expands as the dogleg angles increase , providing directly an increase in the path length the particle beam sees .",
    "a schematic of this arrangement is shown in figure [ fig : pcschematic ] .",
    "note that the inner focusing chicane dipoles pivot on the girders as the dogleg angle changes , so that the edge angles remain symmetric with the outer dipoles .    since only a small transverse dispersion @xmath50 is generated in the focusing chicane when the dogleg angles increase , the small resultant change in longitudinal dispersion ( via the usual @xmath51 ) it is readily compensated by a smaller electromagnetically - generated change of bend angle in the non - focusing chicane . in the non - focusing chicane a given change in longitudinal dispersion results in a much smaller change in the path length because the horizontal dispersion @xmath50 is much larger in the central dipoles than it is in the focusing chicane .",
    "the combination of the two chicanes therefore provides a simple way to decouple the longitudinal dispersion from the path length change .",
    "we show as an example a modular path corrector that provides a path length change of @xmath29  cm .",
    "figure [ fig : pcschematic ] shows a mechanical arrangement of a suitable focusing chicane using dipoles of length 20  cm ( possible for electron beam energies up to around 200  mev ) , whilst figure [ fig : pcslide ] shows how the central region expands to provide a physical path length change .",
    "the change in path length with bend angle is given in figure [ fig : pld ] .",
    "of 400  mm , compared to that of a system with no bend at all .",
    "the dogleg angle.,height=188 ]",
    "we now consider the beam optics of two example systems that perform path length adjustment , one for low energies ( 35 or 100  mev ) and one suitable for use on the proposed uk new light source ( nls ) intermediate recirculation loop at 1200  mev @xcite . in both cases",
    "we assume as before the use of 1.3  ghz superconducting cavities for acceleration .",
    "table [ tab : magnettable ] give the dipole parameters for the two systems , using the equations given in sections [ sec : fourdipole ] and [ sec : dogleg ] .",
    "the 35/100  mev layout corresponds to the engineering concept described in section [ sec : retard ] , 35  mev to compare with the alice arc design , and 100  mev as a higher - field design typical of the energies needed for an infrared fel . whilst the 1200  mev layout is longer , the moveable arms of the focusing chicane are still feasible despite having longer dipoles .",
    "figure [ fig : kfunc ] shows the required focusing strength @xmath52 of the outer f - quadrupoles in each 35/100  mev focusing chicane arm which are required to close the dispersion as the bend angle increases ; the higher energy layout has similar behaviour .",
    "our experience on alice is that only infrequent movements of the arc are required .",
    "as the arc is moved it is advantageous that the transverse focusing is not significantly affected , as this enables operators to tune the path length independently of the optics .",
    "subsequent to the path length change a minor tune - up of the focusing is then performed .",
    "complete decoupling of the optics of the path corrector from the rest of the accelerator is not therefore needed , but the coupling should be small . in the case of the present modular path corrector , we aim that that the path length may be adjusted over a full rf wavelength without overly - large influences in the longitudinal and transverse focusing .",
    ".[tab : magnettable].magnet parameters for the two example path corrector layouts , and used at three illustrative beam energies .",
    "fc denotes the focusing chicane dipoles , whilst nc denotes the non - focusing chicane ( dogleg ) dipoles . at 35 and 100",
    "mev the layouts are the same , and a representative required @xmath3 of 400  mm is assumed , which is a typical requirement at these energies . at 1200  mev",
    "we assume that the path corrector provides the 80  mm @xmath3 required in the nls design at this energy @xcite .",
    "different @xmath3 demands may be readily met by adjustment of the nc parameters .",
    "the small and changing value of @xmath3 generated in the fc section is not shown as it is compensated by a small change in the nc to maintain the overall compression . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ fig : r561200max ] shows the development of @xmath3 and @xmath53 in the 1200  mev path corrector in the maximum position , and figures [ fig : betasmin1200 ] and [ fig : betasmax1200 ] show the change in twiss functions as the fc is moved .",
    "although the relative contribution to @xmath3 and @xmath53 from the fc is larger , its effect on the overall beam transport is modest .",
    "similarly , the chromatic derivative of dispersion ( shown in figure [ fig : disp1200max ] ) is still manageable with local sextupole correction .",
    "( solid ) and @xmath53 ( dashed ) in the complete 1200  mev path corrector at maximum path length change ( 20 degrees fc bend angle ) .",
    "the nc bend angle has been changed to compensate the small @xmath3 generated by the fc , to maintain an overall value of 80  mm .",
    "the @xmath53 generated by the fc is larger in comparison to the nc contribution than in the 35/100  mev case , but linearisation may still be carried out using the third - harmonic rf.,height=170 ]     functions in @xmath18 ( solid , black ) and @xmath54 ( dashed , black ) for the 1200  mev path corrector in its minimum path length position , showing also the cumulative chromatic functions @xmath55 ( heavy dots , red ) and @xmath56 ( light dots , red ) from @xmath57 at the path corrector entrance.,height=170 ]     functions in @xmath18 ( solid , black ) and @xmath54 ( dashed , black ) for the 1200  mev path corrector in its maximum path length position , showing also the cumulative chromatic functions @xmath55 ( heavy dots , red ) and @xmath56 ( light dots , red ) from @xmath57 at the path corrector entrance.,height=170 ]     and chromatic derivative of dispersion @xmath58 in the 1200  mev path corrector in its maximum path length position . similarly to the lower - energy case , sextupoles may be used to zero @xmath58 at the fc end.,height=170 ]",
    "we have presented a dedicated beamline section that can perform path correction in a recirculating linac whilst leaving longitudinal dispersion unchanged , and that has little coupling to the downstream transverse optics .",
    "it may also be incorporated with an existing chicane - based bunch compression system to maintain any desired value of @xmath3 . by decoupling the path length correction",
    "we propose that this scheme may be used more easily than the alternative method of perturbing arc optics , and we have shown that the focusing chicane required to do this can be kept to a length of @xmath5910  m at typical beam energies of c.  1  gev . at this size",
    "the mechanical stability will be similar to that demonstrated on alice , giving confidence that a sub-1 degree accuracy of rf phase accuracy may be achieved .",
    "changing nonlinearities are either small or readily correctable using standard techniques applied to linac beam transport , and may be applied during path correction changes using look - up tables if required .",
    "we propose that this technique is an attractive option for use in gev - scale recirculating linacs .",
