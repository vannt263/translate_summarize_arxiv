    "understanding the complex dynamics of sea level and tide gauge records is necessary for testing models of sea level changes against data and to provide local governments with efficient forecasts for planning appropriate actions to protect communities from possible sea inundation and for other civil purposes .",
    "long - term sea level variations are driven by numerous coupled processes arising from an interaction of eustatic sea level rise and glacial isostatic subsidence , long - term tidal and solar cycles , oscillations of ocean circulation , variations in temperature and/or salinity and other factors that can be also characteristic of the specific geographical location ( e.g : * ? ? ?",

    "despite their intrinsic dynamical complexity , tide gauge records are often analyzed using simplistic mathematical approaches , such as fitting one given time interval with a second order polynomial of the type :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the sea level average acceleration during the fitted period ( it does not depend on @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is the sea level rate at @xmath3 , and @xmath5 is the average level at @xmath3 . the reference date , @xmath3 , can be changed as necessary .",
    "however , it is easy to demonstrate that fitting tide gauge records within just one generic period can yield severely ambiguous results .",
    "in fact , complex signals are characterized by specific multi - scale patterns that a regression analysis on a fixed time interval can obscure . simply changing the length and the time period used for",
    "the analysis can significantly alter the values of the regression parameters .",
    "for example , sea - level accelerations are critical components for understanding the forces that determine their dynamical evolution and for projecting future sea levels . without any acceleration ,",
    "the 20th century global sea - level average trend of @xmath6 @xmath7 would produce a rise of only @xmath8 @xmath9 from 2010 to 2100 @xcite .",
    "however , the scientific literature reports apparently contrasting results about the acceleration values .",
    "let us discuss a few cases .",
    "\\(1 ) @xcite used secular - long time series and estimated that the global sea level from 1880 to 2004 experienced a modest acceleration , @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite repeated the analysis for the period 1880 - 2009 and found a slightly smaller value , @xmath12 @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite analyzed 25 tide gauges for the period 1930 to 2010 and found a mean negative acceleration , @xmath13 @xmath11 ( 95% ) , where the 17 gauge records for the atlantic zone had an average acceleration of @xmath14 @xmath11 ( 95% ) and 8 gauge records from the pacific coast had an average acceleration of @xmath15 @xmath11(95% ) .",
    "if the above ( positive or negative ) acceleration values persist also for the 21st century , their overall effect would be modest : the average sea level could rise @xmath16 @xmath9 from 2010 to 2100 by taking into account also the @xmath6 @xmath7 average linear rate .",
    "\\(2 ) @xcite analyzed the period 1950 - 2009 and found that numerous locations of the atlantic coast of north america are characterized by strong positive accelerations .",
    "similar results were found also by @xcite , who used quadratic polynomial regressions to analyze a number of u.s . and",
    "canadian tide gauge records over the 43 years period from 1969 to 2011 .",
    "for example , in new york city the acceleration during the 1950 - 2009 period was estimated to be @xmath17 @xmath11 ( @xmath18 error , annual resolution ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* supplementary figure s7 ) . for the periods 1960 - 2009 and 1970 - 2009",
    "the acceleration values would progressively increase : @xmath19 @xmath11 and @xmath20 @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the progressive increase of the acceleration value was claimed to depart from past values and was interpreted as due to the anthropogenic warming of the last decades causing significant changes in the strength of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation and of the gulf stream .",
    "evidently , high positive acceleration values and their progressive increase would be quite alarming if this trend persists also during the 21st century , as the anthropogenic global warming theory would predict @xcite .",
    "for example , in new york city , if the 1970 - 2009 acceleration remains constant during the 21st century and the 1970 - 2009 quadratic polynomial fit is used to extrapolate the 21st century sea level rise , the sea level could increase by @xmath21 @xmath9 from 2000 to 2100 . for new york city , @xcite used his 1969 - 2011 quadratic polynomial fit to project a sea level rise of 390 - 750 mm above the 1983 - 2001 sea level mean by 2050 .",
    "however , i observe that using the 1900 - 2000 quadratic polynomial fit extrapolation , which produces an acceleration of just @xmath22 @xmath11 , in new york city the sea level could increase by just @xmath23 @xmath9 from 2000 to 2100 ( that is mostly due to the linear rate of @xmath24 mm / year ) , which makes a significant difference .",
    "\\(3 ) @xcite analyzed 456 globally distributed monthly tide gauge records and satellite measured records for the period 1993 - 2011 and found negative average accelerations ( with a relatively large uncertainty ) , @xmath25 @xmath11 ( gauges ) vs. @xmath26 @xmath11 ( satellites ) .",
    "therefore , during the last two decades the sea level accelerations have been mostly negative at numerous locations .",
    "if these negative accelerations persist during the 21st century , sea level rates would significantly slow down and , eventually , sea levels could even decrease in numerous locations .",
    "\\(4 ) @xcite analyzed two century - long tide gauge records referring to the east and west coast of australia , sydney and fremantle , and found secular accelerations of @xmath27 @xmath11 and @xmath28 @xmath11 , respectively , and for the 20-year period from jan/1990 to dec/2009 he found accelerations of @xmath29 @xmath11 and @xmath308 @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "@xcite used the same tide gauge records used by boretti but with an annual resolution , and for the 21-year period from 1990 to 2010 found @xmath31 @xmath11 ( sydney ) and @xmath32 @xmath11 ( fremantle ) ; they also reported the global accelerations measured by satellite altimeters for the 1993 - 2009 period , @xmath33 @xmath11 , and from theoretical computer climate models for the period 1990 - 2009 , @xmath34 @xmath11 .",
    "as it is evident by comparing the above apparently contrasting results , the evaluated accelerations appear to strongly depend not only on the location , but also on the time intervals chosen for the regression analysis .",
    "sea level records are not just randomly evolving around an acceleration background trending , but they appear to be characterized by complex natural oscillations .",
    "consequently , each of the above estimated acceleration values , by alone , may not tell us much about the true long - range dynamics of tide gauge records .",
    "indeed , those numbers may be highly ambiguous and may generate confusion to some readers , e.g. policy makers , who may wonder whether sea levels are strongly accelerating , or strongly decelerating , or not accelerating or decelerating at all .",
    "moreover , comparing sea level acceleration values from different locations measured using records of different lengths and periods ( e.g. as done in : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be equally misleading in presence of oscillations .",
    "indeed , quasi 20-year and 60-year oscillations have been found in sea level records @xcite , although the patterns referring to individual tide gauge records appear to be quite complex and inhomogeneous ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "cyclic changes could partially explain why the accelerations of these records are close to zero when quasi secular - long records are analyzed @xcite , while the same records may present large positive accelerations when short periods of 40 - 60 years between 1950 to 2009 are analyzed , as done by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "cyclic changes could also explain the large volatility measured in the acceleration values at the decadal and bi - decadal scales .",
    "indeed , quasi decadal , bi - decadal and 50 - 90 year oscillations have been found for centuries and millennia in numerous climate and marine records @xcite . since 1850 quasi decadal , bidecadal and 60-year oscillations",
    "have been found in global temperature records , are typical astronomical / solar oscillations and will likely exist also in the future @xcite .",
    "thus , it is legitimate to expect that equivalent oscillations ( with appropriate phase shifts depending on the geographical location ) may characterize numerous tide gauge records too .",
    "for example , it is possible that @xcite found very large positive acceleration values in the tide gauge records for new york city and other u.s .",
    "atlantic cities ( the so - called `` _ _ hot - spot__s '' ) simply because these authors compared trends between the periods 1950 - 1979 and 1980 - 2009 that could follow from a valley to a peak the 60-year oscillation commonly found in the atlantic multidecadal oscillation ( amo ) , in the pacific decadal oscillation ( pdo ) and in the north atlantic oscillation ( nao ) indexes @xcite .",
    "this 60-year oscillation may have made the tide gauge record for new york city as well as for other u.s .",
    "atlantic cities concave from 1950 to 2009 .",
    "a similar critique would apply also to the results by @xcite , who used 1969 - 2011 quadratic polynomial fits to project future sea level trends up to 2050 .",
    "for the same reason , @xcite found significant negative accelerations for the period 1993 - 2011 likely because the bidecadal and the 60-year oscillations may have been bending down during this period by making the tide gauge records momentarily convex .",
    "below , i will demonstrate the validity of the critique .",
    "herein i propose a multi - scale dynamical analysis ( msda ) methodology to study dynamical patterns revealed in tide gauge records .",
    "msda uses colored palette diagrams to represent local accelerations , rates and average annual seasonal amplitudes at multiple scales and time periods .",
    "this methodology aims : ( 1 ) to provide a comprehensive dynamical picture of climatic records ; ( 2 ) to facilitate their physical interpretation by highlighting interconnections and dynamical couplings among climatic indexes ; ( 3 ) to avoid possible embarrassing ambiguities emerging from arbitrary choices of the time intervals used for the regression analysis ; ( 4 ) to develop more appropriate forecast models that take into account the real dynamics of these records .",
    "the msda visualization technique is used to analyze dynamical details in six secular - long tide gauge records that approximately provide a global coverage of the world oceans .",
    "sydney , fremantle , and new york city were also analyzed using more simplistic methodologies in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite : so a reader may better appreciate the high performance of msda by comparing its results with those recently published by other scientists .",
    "the msda diagrams are compared versus equivalent diagrams referring to the pdo index and to the amo index to provide a physical interpretation of the results .",
    "the tide gauge records of honolulu , san diego and venice are briefly studied to provide a more worldwide picture of the situation and to highlight additional teleconnection patterns among different regions .",
    "finally , msda diagrams are used to compare a global reconstruction of sea level @xcite and a reconstruction of the nao index @xcite : both sequences cover about three centuries since 1700 and can be used to highlight a possible physical coupling and to confirm the presence of a major 60 - 70 year natural oscillation in these records .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure 6 zooms and compares the three msaa diagrams for sydney , fremantle and pdo within the scales from 5 to 20 years .",
    "extended cross - correlations of the two tide gauge records with the pdo index are evident .",
    "the cross - correlation coefficient between sydney and pdo msaa diagram areas within the chosen 5 - 20 year scale is @xmath35 and between fremantle and pdo is @xmath36 .",
    "these cross - correlation values are highly significant considering the length of the records .",
    "see table 3 for cross - correlation values for each annual scale .    the comparison between new york ( fig .",
    "4a ) and amo ( fig .",
    "4b ) msaa diagrams suggests extended correlations at almost all scales , although an evident time - lag of about 10 - 15 years is observed at the scales from 30 to 110 years .",
    "this scale range also highlights the strong influence of the 60-year amo oscillation on this tide gauge record .",
    "time - lags between the amo and pdo indexes and tide gauge records depend on the specific location because a change of the temperature may induce variation in the ocean circulation that effects differently each location ( e.g. : * ? ? ?",
    "figure 7 shows the data and the msaa diagrams for the tide gauge records of honolulu , san diego and venice .",
    "all three records present a negative acceleration at the secular scale ( green color at the top of the triangles ) . at the 10 - 30 year scales , honolulu and san diego present large and synchronous quasi bi - decadal oscillations ( the color alternate between blue and red every about 20 years ) . at scales larger than 30 years",
    "the msaa for honolulu and san diego reveals interesting symmetric patterns with green and red oblique bands moving in opposite directions .",
    "this pattern may emerge because according to figure 5 during the pdo warm phase san diego warms while hawaii is located in a boundary region of the pacific ocean between the warm and the cold regions .",
    "the tide gauge record for venice presents some similarity with the other records at the 10 - 30 year scales with clear decadal and bi - decadal oscillations , in particular with the amo index ( fig .",
    "4b ) . in venice",
    "the sea level acceleration was moderately positive during the beginning of the 20th century , while it became moderately negative at the end of the 20th century for scales larger than 30 years .",
    "an extended quantitative analysis of the time - lags and cross - correlation patterns among different records , which may also be scale dependent , is left to future research and it is not relevant for this work .",
    "a visual cross - correlation study among different records and scales can be in first approximation easily accomplished on a computer screen by drawing a vertical line crossing the msaa diagrams ( which in the used figures are carefully alined ) and moving the line horizontally to analyze the areas of interest .",
    "the `` acceleration '' used in the msaa can be substituted with other physical measures ( e.g. , rates , etc . ) as necessary . here a multi - scale rate analysis ( msra ) is proposed .",
    "for example , for determining the average rate , @xmath37 , during a specific time period , the data have to be fit with a linear function of the type :    @xmath38    where @xmath37 is the average rate in @xmath7 during the analyzed period , and @xmath5is the level at @xmath3 .",
    "the annual oscillation is added in the regression model for improved accuracy although almost no difference in the colored diagrams would be observed for tide gauge records .",
    "once the rate values are calculated for all available time intervals and scales , they can be plotted using a colored palette diagram .",
    "figure 8 shows the results obtained for the six tide gauge records used in the paper",
    ".    evidently , also the rate changes and oscillates in function of the time interval and of the scale . at smaller scales ( 10 - 30 year ) a large volatility is observed , and also negative rates are observed during specific periods . extended periods with rates close to zero ( green color ) are observed in many records .",
    "the color at the top of the triangles gives the average secular rate at the highest available scale , that is , for the entire available record .",
    "the following secular rate values are obtained : [ a ] sydney , @xmath39 @xmath7 ; [ b ] honolulu , @xmath40 @xmath7 ; [ c ] fremantle , @xmath41 @xmath7 ; [ d ] san diego , @xmath42 @xmath7 ; [ e ] new york , @xmath43 @xmath7 ; [ f ] venice , @xmath44 @xmath7 .",
    "[ eq:1 - 1 ] contains harmonic constructors that can be used to evaluate the average amplitude and phase of the annual cycle presents in the tide gauge records .",
    "for example , for each scale and period it is possible to evaluate a total average amplitude ( from minimum to maximum ) with the equation :    @xmath45    the msacaa diagrams for the six tide gauge records are shown in figure 9 .",
    "also the average seasonal annual amplitude of the tide gauge records varies with the scale and the time period . in the case of sydney , hononulu , fremantle and sydney , which are within the area of influence of the pacific ocean ,",
    "the amplitude of the annual cycle increased on average almost at all scales above 20 years from 1900 to 2000 , as demonstrated by the predominantly green colors on the left side of the diagrams that slightly become yellow / red on the right side .",
    "however , the opposite pattern is observed for new york city and venice , which are within the area of influence of the atlantic ocean .",
    "thus , the analysis appears to reveal an important asymmetric and compensating dynamical evolution between the pacific and the atlantic oceans .",
    "extending the analysis to additional records may clarify this issue . at smaller scales ,",
    "several oscillations are observed .",
    "figure 10a depicts a global sea level record @xcite ( left ) and its msaa ( right ) . eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] is used because the record has an annual resolution .",
    "figure 10b depicts a reconstruction of the north atlantic oscillation ( nao ) @xcite ( left ) and its msaa ( right ) .",
    "both records cover about 300 years from 1700 to 2002 and from 1658 to 2001 , respectively . in figure 10b , which refers to the nao index ,",
    "the colors of the msaa diagram are inverted .",
    "note that @xcite used a linear scale truncated at @xmath46 @xmath11 , while i propose to use a logarithmic scale to cover a wider and more comprehensive range of @xmath47 @xmath11 .",
    "it is easy to notice that the two records present well correlated quasi 60 - 70 year oscillations since 1700 , as indicated by the alternating green and red regions : there appear to be a small phase - lag of a few years .",
    "this result indicates that at the 30 - 100 year time scales the local accelerations of this global sea level record and of the nao index are negatively correlated .",
    "thus , in the global sea level record proposed by @xcite the sea level decreases when nao is positive , that is the air pressure at the lower latitudes is high .",
    "the following cross - correlation coefficients between the two msaa area diagrams are found : within the 20 - 100 year scales , @xmath48 ; within the 30 - 100 year scales , @xmath49 ; within the 40 - 100 year scales , @xmath50 .",
    "these correlation values are highly significant .    for scales larger than 110 years",
    "up to 300 years , the sea level presents quasi uniform accelerations of about @xmath51 @xmath11 from 1700 to 2000 , as indicated by the orange color in figure 10a2 .",
    "for example , fitting the global sea level record during the 1700 - 2000 period gives @xmath52 @xmath11 , during the preindustrial 1700 - 1900 period gives @xmath53 @xmath11 , and during the industrial 1900 - 2000 period gives @xmath54 @xmath11 .",
    "this result might also suggest that the observed background multisecular acceleration of about @xmath51 @xmath11 has a natural origin and may be independent of the late 20th century anthropogenic warming .",
    "indeed , the quasi - millennial solar / climate cycle observed throughout the holocene has been in its warming phase since the 17th century , which experienced the coldest period of the little ice age during the maunder solar minimum , and may reach a maximum during the second half of 21st century @xcite .    using eq .",

    "herein i have proposed a multi - scale dynamical analysis ( msda ) to study climatic records .",
    "the proposed technique uses graphical diagrams that greatly facilitate a comparative analysis among tide gauge records and other climatic indexes such as pdo , amo and nao .",
    "these records are found to be characterized by significant oscillations at the decadal and multidcadal scales up to about 110-year intervals . within",
    "these scales both positive and negative accelerations are found if a record is sufficiently long .",
    "this result suggests that acceleration patterns in tide gauge records are mostly driven by the natural oscillations of the climate system .",
    "the volatility of the acceleration increases drastically at smaller scales such as at the bi - decadal ones .",
    "msaa clearly reveals a macroscopic influence of the quasi 60-year pdo and amo oscillation in the tide gauge records , in particular for fremantle and new york city .",
    "in fact , although during the last 40 - 60 years positive accelerations are typically observed in tide gauge records , as found by @xcite and by @xcite , also during 40 - 60 year intervals since the beginning of the 20th century equivalent or even higher positive accelerations are typically observed . on the contrary , at these same time scales ,",
    "negative accelerations are observed during the middle of the 20th century .",
    "this pattern demonstrates the influence of a large multidecadal 60-year natural cycle , which has been found in climate and solar / astronomical records by numerous authors ( e.g : * ? ? ?",

    "the figure demonstrates that the sea level acceleration patterns during the last 60 years are not particularly anomalous relative to previous periods because they repeat quasi - periodically for three hundred years and well correlate with an independent climatic index such as the long nao reconstruction record by @xcite .",
    "because of the presence of a quasi 60-year oscillation , a background secular acceleration ( e.g. one that could be caused by the 20th century anthropogenic warming ) can be properly evaluated only for tide gauge records longer than about 110 years , as figure 10a2 implicitly shows .",
    "if only shorter periods are available , separating a background acceleration from a 60-year oscillation is quite difficult because the record would not be sufficiently long to determine the correct amplitude and phase of the oscillation , which are required to separate the oscillation from a background quadratic polynomial term .",
    "more precisely , if the time interval to be fitted is significantly shorter than about 2 periods of the oscillation , a quadratic polynomial constructor would be too collinear with a sinusoidal oscillation , and in collinearity cases the linear regression algorithm becomes highly unreliable .",
    "the test depicted in figure 11 demonstrates that the minimum length that a record must have for making a quadratic polynomial constructor fully orthogonal to a sinusoidal curve is @xmath64 the period of the oscillation : that is , a 110-year long record is necessary for fully filtering out a 60-year periodic cycle from a background quadratic polynomial trend . in general , as figure 11d implies , in the case of a record characterized by a 60-year cycle , using 100-year or longer records would be sufficiently fine , but using , for example , 60-year long or shorter records ( e.g. as done in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be highly misleading because the quadratic fit would interpret the bending of the 60-year oscillation as a strongly accelerating trend .",
    "when about 100-year long records are studied the evaluated average accelerations are ( positively or negatively ) close to zero @xcite . among the analyzed six tide gauge records ( sydney , fremantle , new york , honolulu , san diego and venice ) two records present a slight positive secular acceleration ( @xmath65 @xmath11 ) , while the other four records present a slight negative secular acceleration ( @xmath66 @xmath11 ) .",
    "the 1700 - 2000 global sea level index proposed by @xcite shows an almost uniform acceleration ( @xmath65 @xmath11 ) at scales larger than 110 years spanning from the little ice age in 1700 to modern times .",
    "thus , it is difficult to determine whether the late 20th century anthropogenic warming had a significant effect on tide gauge records .",
    "an anthropogenic warming effect appears to be in any case too small to be clearly separated from the multidecadal and multisecular natural variability .",
    "for example , because the global sea level record proposed by @xcite presents an uniform secular - scale acceleration of about @xmath65 @xmath11 since 1700 , a theoretical post-1900 sea level acceleration associated to the anthropogenic warming could be constrained between @xmath67 @xmath11 and @xmath68 @xmath11 , where the upper limit would apply in the eventuality that the natural acceleration component from 1700 to 1900 was due to a millennial oscillation that since 1900 changed inflection by turning the natural component of the acceleration into a negative value of @xmath66 @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , the slight negative secular acceleration found in a majority of tide gauge records @xcite may also be due to the quasi millennial oscillation typically found in numerous climatic and solar indexes throughout the holocene , which will reach its millennium maximum during the 21st century @xcite .    in conclusion , at scales shorter than 100-years , the measured tide gauge accelerations are strongly driven by the natural oscillations of the climate system ( e.g. pdo , amo and nao ) . at the smaller scales ( e.g. at the decadal and bi - decadal scale ) they are characterized by a large volatility due to significant decadal and bi - decadal climatic oscillations @xcite .",
    "therefore , accelerations , as well as linear rates evaluated using a few decades of data ( e.g. during the last 20 - 60 years ) can not be used for constructing reliable long - range projections of sea - level for the 21st century .",

    "<S> herein i propose a multi - scale dynamical analysis to facilitate the physical interpretation of tide gauge records . </S>",
    "<S> the technique uses graphical diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> it is applied to six secular - long tide gauge records representative of the world oceans : sydney , pacific coast of australia ; fremantle , indian ocean coast of australia ; new york city , atlantic coast of usa ; honolulu , u.s . </S>",
    "<S> state of hawaii ; san diego , u.s . </S>",
    "<S> state of california ; and venice , mediterranean sea , italy . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> an equivalent analysis is applied to the pacific decadal oscillation ( pdo ) index and to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation ( amo ) index . finally , a global reconstruction of sea level @xcite and a reconstruction of the north atlantic oscillation ( nao ) index @xcite are analyzed and compared : both sequences cover about three centuries from 1700 to 2000 . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed methodology quickly highlights oscillations and teleconnections among the records at the decadal and multidecadal scales . at the secular time </S>",
    "<S> scales tide gauge records present relatively small ( positive or negative ) accelerations , as found in other studies @xcite . on the contrary , from the decadal to the secular scales ( up to 110-year intervals ) the tide gauge accelerations oscillate significantly from positive to negative values mostly following the pdo , amo and nao oscillations . in particular , the influence of a large quasi 60 - 70 year natural oscillation is clearly demonstrated in these records . </S>",
    "<S> the multiscale dynamical evolutions of the rate and of the amplitude of the annual seasonal cycle of the chosen six tide gauge records are also studied .    </S>",
