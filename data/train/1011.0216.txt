    "the ten - dimensional iia dilaton is given by @xmath244 and the metric coefficients are @xmath245 for large @xmath67 , the dilaton grows exponentially without limit .",
    "this growth can be slowed by taking a large @xmath246 or a large @xmath184 limit but , however large @xmath184 or @xmath246 become ( provided they are finite ) the dilaton will become large beyond some value of @xmath67 . we conclude that , for @xmath247 , the dilaton is small and the physics is approximated well by a weakly - coupled ten - dimensional string theory ; however , where @xmath67 becomes much larger than @xmath246 , the theory becomes eleven - dimensional and the perturbative string description breaks down . a similar analysis may be carried out for the general periodic case ( [ bessel ] ) .",
    "the key point is that @xmath194 dies off at large @xmath67 - consistent with the positivity conditions of the space - time metric - and this leads to a growth in the dilaton at large @xmath67 so that , as described for the example considered above , the solution is well - described by perturbative string theory for small values of @xmath67 , but m - theory is required to provide a global description of the theory .",

    "these solutions are conjectured to be dual to general @xmath0 scfts discussed recently by gaiotto  @xcite .",
    "our construction is completely general : given a generalised quiver describing an @xmath0 scfts there is a corresponding line charge profile @xmath81 for which we construct explicitly the corresponding spacetime metric , dilaton and fluxes .",

    "secondly , there are the @xmath81 profiles which we have called uluru ; the solutions of this type are discussed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that both kinds of solutions can be viewed as ( finite or infinite ) superpositions of mn solutions .",
    "this fits in well with our understanding of the mn solution as a dual description of a stack of m5-branes wrapping the hyperbolic plane .",
    "more general @xmath0 scfts are given by some intersections of such stacks of m5-branes and our solutions validate this intuition .",
    "the solutions we have constructed can be viewed as reductions of m - theory solutions with the gm ansatz .",
    "the reduction introduces a smearing along the m - theory circle . as a result",
    "the solutions are valid only on length scales larger than the typical smearing scale .",
    "we have seen that a generic feature of the periodic uluru solutions are regions of spacetime for which the string coupling is large .",
    "it seems that to understand completely the dual description of these @xmath0 scfts we will need to go to the full m - theory . for this one will need to find non - smeared solutions of the toda equation  ( [ toda ] ) .",
