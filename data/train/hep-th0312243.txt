    "topological sigma models , first put forward by witten @xcite , have long fascinated a number of theoretical physicists and mathematicians .",
    "most remarkably , the task of summing up worldsheet instantons is nowadays elegantly formulated by the theory of gromov - witten invariants .",
    "explicit computations of them are still being actively pursued .",
    "it goes without saying that among many possible target spaces calabi - yau threefolds have played distinguished roles and are of lasting interest to string theorists . since the initial appreciation of the significance of d - branes there has been the lingering hope that the gromov - witten theory of calabi - yau threefolds might be completely rewritten in the language of bps d - branes .",
    "this contribution is intended for explaining the picture which , to my eye , looks particularly attractive in this regard .",
    "this is based on the general philosophy :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the geometry of @xmath0-@xmath1 branes ( and _ not _ simply @xmath0-branes ) provides an alternative description of gromov - witten invariants of calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    what we actually imagine is very simple and intuitive : in analogy with the ( generalized ) super kac - moody algebras we regard the string partition function as the inverse of  denominator function \" and interpret the bound state degeneracies of @xmath0-@xmath1 branes as the  super root multiplicities \" .",
    "the gromov - witten potentials are then extracted from the string partition function . in particular , the variable @xmath2 measuring @xmath1-charge is related to the genus expansion parameter @xmath3 of gromov - witten theory by @xmath4 .",
    "this sort of idea was formerly presented in @xcite when the calabi - yau threefold is elliptically fibered over a hirzebruch surface . there , an analogy to borcherds products @xcite was pursued .",
    "recall that borcherds products or their inverses arise in some cases as the denominator functions of generalized ( super ) kac - moody algebras .",
    "the first hint of the relevance of borcherds products to gromov - witten theory was given by harvey and moore @xcite .",
    "i will report further progress on the string partition functions of these elliptic calabi - yau threefolds elsewhere @xcite .",
    "so the first purpose of this work is simply to extend the @xmath0-@xmath1 picture of @xcite to general calabi - yau threefolds focusing on those aspects which are believed to be independent of any particular details of the threefolds .",
    "some time ago gopakumar and vafa @xcite proposed an alternative reformulation of gromov - witten theory of calabi - yau threefolds based on the space - time effective theory interpretation of gromov - witten potentials .",
    "this claim has been influential but at the same time very mysterious ( at least to the author ) .",
    "the second objective of this paper is to discuss how this proposal of gopakumar and vafa may actually reconcile with ours .",
    "quite recently , the relation between singular instantons of @xmath5 @xmath6 gauge theory and gromov - witten theory has been discussed @xcite in relation to the topological vertex formalism @xcite .",
    "this gauge theoretic approach ( donaldson - thomas theory ) is probably a dual viewpoint of our @xmath0-@xmath1 picture in the same way point - like instantons of @xmath7 @xmath6 gauge theory describe @xmath1-branes .",
    "so , as far as the ideology is concerned , these works seem to have some overlaps with @xcite and the present work .",
    "nevertheless , there is a marked difference in practice : they discuss the  sum side \" with a supply of explicit calculations for local toric calabi - yau threefolds using the localization technique whilst we discuss the  product side \" inspired from the examples of certain elliptic calabi - yau threefolds and the associated borcherds - like products @xcite@xcite",
    ". it will be very interesting ( and necessary ! ) to investigate the existence of ",
    "sum = product \" formulas connecting both sides for a general calabi - yau threefold .",
    "in fact , the topological vertex formalism of @xcite seems to allow an intuitive understanding in terms of @xmath0-branes and @xmath1-branes .",
    "[ comment ] for comments on this point .",
    "i am grateful to k. yoshioka for the collaboration in @xcite .",
    "i also thank a.  okounkov for kindly pointing out my nonsensical statement in the previous version of the manuscript and for explaining to me the marvelous proposal of him and his collaborators . .",
    "for a rational function @xmath8 of one variable @xmath2 we define @xmath9 as follows : @xmath10 is the laurent series of @xmath8 at @xmath11 and @xmath12 is that at @xmath13 .",
    "consider , for instance , @xmath14 for an integer @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath16 then @xmath17 and @xmath18 coincide in @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "however , @xmath20\\,.\\ ] ]    a calabi - yau threefold @xmath21 is a complex 3-dimensional smooth projective variety with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 is polarized by some ample line bundle .",
    "if one ever wishes to connect gromov - witten theory of calabi - yau threefolds to some sort of of bps @xmath24-brane counting , one might think that @xmath0-branes alone are relevant since gromov - witten theory is concerned with curve counting problems .",
    "however , this is too naive and even misleading .",
    "what needs to be emphasized is that in any attempt of this sort we have to incorporate the effects of @xmath1-branes in addition to @xmath0-branes .",
    "take as an example the case of a resolved conifold , the total space of @xmath25 .",
    "since the @xmath26 in the resolved conifold is rigid and the jacobian of @xmath26 is just a point , the moduli space of @xmath0-brane wrapping around the @xmath26 is also a point .",
    "if @xmath0-branes were the only relevant @xmath24-branes , this would mean that the gromov - witten theory of the resolved conifold was trivial .",
    "this is simply absurd given the result of @xcite .    the origin for",
    "the necessity of @xmath1-branes may be roughly as follows .",
    "let us suppose that we are trying to answer the problem of counting curves in a calabi - yau threefold @xmath21",
    ". there could be several different approaches according what we mean by _",
    "counting_.    in a crude approach by @xmath24-branes",
    "one may make curves  charged \" by putting line bundles , ( or more generally , rank one torsion - free sheaves ) on them and then claim , to within signs , the euler - poincar ' e characteristics of the moduli spaces of such sheaves ( regarded as torsion sheaves on @xmath21 ) with fixed @xmath24-brane charges as the  numbers of curves \" .",
    "apparently , in this naive approach we are concerned with @xmath0-branes alone .    in gromov - witten theory , on the other hand , one tries to  count holomorphic maps \" from worldsheet connected curves to target curves in @xmath21 and regard this as a good substitute of directly counting curves in @xmath21 .",
    "however , this very substitution introduces some well - known complications .",
    "one of them is the so - called multi - covering effect .",
    "this is rather innocuous since we know more or less how to handle it .",
    "another complication , which seems to be more difficult , is related to conformal invariance of the holomorphic map equation and is known as bubbling phenomena . in order to have a nice intersection theory one must compactify the moduli space of holomorphic maps . for this",
    "we have to include degenerate contributions of bubble trees ( bubbling of bubbling of  ) .",
    "it should be precisely for this reason that we have to modify the naive @xmath0-brane approach by including @xmath1-branes when one attempts to rewrite gromov - witten theory in terms of @xmath24-branes .",
    "an intuitive picture of @xmath1-branes bound to a @xmath0-brane is that of vortices .",
    "so morally speaking , _ bubble trees turn into vortices_.",
    "suppose that we are given a super kac - moody algebra .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the additive semigroup generated by simple roots .",
    "we write @xmath28 iff @xmath29 .",
    "any @xmath28 is either even or odd .",
    "consider @xmath30 so that @xmath28 is a positive root iff @xmath31 .",
    "we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath34-th adams operation sending @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the right hand side is the inverse of the denominator function in the product form .    in a nutshell ,",
    "what we intend to do is to make the analogy of this relation in studying a calabi - yau threefold @xmath21 .",
    "we express any element of @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "denote by @xmath41 the additive semigroup of classes of effective 1-cycles (  holomorpic curves \" ) on @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , @xmath41 is the intersection of the mori cone with @xmath42 .",
    "we write @xmath43 iff @xmath44 . similarly ,",
    "for @xmath45 we write @xmath46 iff @xmath47 \\quad \\text{or}\\quad   \\bigl[\\beta=0 \\text{\\ and\\ } j>0\\bigr]\\,.\\ ] ] assume that there is a suitable @xmath48-grading so that any @xmath46 is either even or odd .",
    "now let us suppose in analogy with @xmath49 the existence of a formal sum : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a formal symbol satisfying @xmath52 . in the proposal below ,",
    "@xmath53 is in @xmath54 rather than in @xmath55 .",
    "this is to match up with the normalization of gromov - witten potentials .",
    "we next introduce the formal truncated .",
    "] free energy @xmath56 where @xmath33 is again the @xmath34-th adams operation sending @xmath57 to @xmath58 .    as the inverse of the  denominator function \"",
    "we are led to consider the following formal product @xmath59 we might call @xmath60 as the formal truncated string partition function . however the expected relation ",
    "@xmath61 \" is rather problematic since , in the formal sum , @xmath62 runs over all integers when @xmath43 so that powers of @xmath63 are not well - defined in general .",
    "thus @xmath63 and @xmath60 in the above should be interpreted at best as motivating expressions . in the following",
    "we will introduce regularized versions @xmath64 and @xmath65 related by @xmath66 .",
    "( these are better behaved but somewhat lose direct analogy with super kac - moody algebras . )    those who are familiar with borcherds products and their relations to surfaces , say , @xmath67 surfaces will recognize that we are trying to cook up a similar story for calabi - yau threefolds here .",
    "a novel and distinct point is the introduction of @xmath68 in addition to @xmath42 .",
    "i intend to further discuss this similarity with borcherds products in @xcite .    for the above analogy to be anything useful we have to know @xmath69 from the geometry of @xmath21 .",
    "our basic expectation is that @xmath70 should be , in some way or another , identified with the ( super ) degeneracy of bounded @xmath0-@xmath1 branes in @xmath21 with a fixed @xmath0-@xmath1 charge @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , what needs to be done is the geometrical understanding of @xmath0-@xmath1 bound systems .",
    "we first recall the gentlemen s agreement @xcite that even - dimensional @xmath24-branes are related to coherent sheaves and their @xmath24-brane charges are determined by mukai vectors @xcite .",
    "we define the @xmath24-brane charge @xmath71 of a coherent sheaf @xmath72 on @xmath21 by @xmath73 $ ] where @xmath74 is the mukai vector of @xmath72 .",
    "we express @xmath71 in the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "note that if the @xmath24-brane charge is of the form @xmath77 then @xmath78 is actually in @xmath79 .",
    "( there is no witten effect . ) for instance , suppose that @xmath80 is a smooth irreducible curve of genus @xmath81 and @xmath82 is a line bundle of degree @xmath83 , then @xmath84 , \\chi(c , l))=(0,0,[c],d+1-g)$ ] .",
    "this is the @xmath24-brane charge of a @xmath0-brane singly wrapping around @xmath85 bound with @xmath83 @xmath1-branes . in this paper",
    "any @xmath0-brane is always singly wrapping by allowing non - reduced curves .    if the @xmath24-brane charge ( or equivalently the mukai vector ) is fixed , the hilbert polynomial is also fixed since @xmath21 is assumed to be polarized .",
    "so it makes sense to consider the moduli space @xmath86 of semi - stable coherent sheaves on @xmath21 with a fixed @xmath24-brane charge @xmath87 . for simplicity",
    "let us suppose that @xmath86 consists only of stable sheaves .",
    "one well - known fact about @xmath86 is that its expected dimension @xmath88 vanishes because of the serre duality where @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the trace free part of @xmath91 . by stability , @xmath92 and by @xmath23",
    ", we have @xmath93 @xmath94 .",
    "the zero - dimensional virtual moduli cycle was constructed in @xcite .",
    "its degree or virtual length @xmath95 serves as the  number of sheaves \" .",
    "the zariski tangent space of @xmath86 at @xmath72 is given by @xmath96 and the obstruction space is @xmath97 .",
    "hence the serre duality tells us that if @xmath86 is smooth , the obstruction sheaf is the cotangent bundle of @xmath86 and @xmath98 .",
    "one can also consider the hilbert scheme @xmath99 with a fixed @xmath24-brane charge @xmath87 .",
    "as usual , we have @xmath100 by considering ideal sheaves . the moduli space of possibly disconnected @xmath0-branes and @xmath1-branes , which we call the total @xmath0-@xmath1 moduli space , is given by @xmath101 where @xmath78 runs over all possible values .",
    "at first sight seems not to deserve its name .",
    "for instance , if an isolated @xmath0-brane is singly wrapping around a smooth curve @xmath102 , there should exist degrees of freedom in how it wraps , namely the jacobian @xmath103 . on the other hand in the hilbert scheme @xmath85",
    "is allowed to carry only @xmath104 .",
    "a possible resolution of this puzzle may be as follows .",
    "first of all if a @xmath0-brane wrapping singly around @xmath85 is bounded to several @xmath1-branes , the moduli space of this bound system is given by a symmetric product of @xmath85 ( as we recall later ) .",
    "so this part of the moduli space is directly related to the hilbert scheme .",
    "the pure @xmath0-brane moduli space @xmath103 is actually related to the symmetric products of @xmath85 through the abel - jacobi maps .",
    "so , once we start to consider both @xmath0-branes and @xmath1-branes simultaneously , we should forget about @xmath103 and only consider the symmetric products of @xmath85 as fundamental in order not to overcount the degrees of freedom . a more explanation is given below about how pure @xmath0-brane moduli spaces are related to the moduli spaces of bounded @xmath0-@xmath1 branes .",
    "( this is not unrelated to the upcoming interpretation of the gopakumar - vafa proposal . )",
    "a relation between @xmath105 and gromov - witten invariants was already hinted in @xcite .",
    "a connection to the gopakumar - vafa invariant was conjectured in @xcite . recently",
    ", a striking connection of @xmath106 to gromov - witten theory has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we expect that @xmath69 is related to but exactly describing this relation seems to be a very difficult problem at the moment .",
    "only a limited attempt is given below .",
    "let us call @xmath107 _ of simple class _ _ _ _ _ if its arithmetic genus @xmath108 is non - negative and for each integer @xmath109 there exist a suitable @xmath0-@xmath1 bound moduli space @xmath110 and a @xmath0 moduli space @xmath111 whose properties we spell out in the following .",
    "we assume that @xmath112 is of simple class and set @xmath113 .",

    "in particular we expect an intimate connection between @xmath110 and @xmath115 .",
    "we assume that @xmath110 is smooth and connected .",
    "as we will see shortly , it seems natural to have @xmath116 we set @xmath117 for convenience .",
    "this is the moduli space of the _ supports _ of @xmath0-branes .",
    "note that @xmath118 by .",
    "there should exist a morphism @xmath119 and @xmath120 moreover , there will be the universal family @xmath121 which is a flat family of curves of class @xmath114 and of arithmetic genus @xmath108 .",
    "in particular we expect @xmath122 where the morphism @xmath123 is the projection . intuitively speaking , @xmath124 is the family of curves around which @xmath0-branes are singly wrapping . in favorable situations",
    "it is tempting to identify @xmath125 with the relative hilbert scheme of points on curves @xmath126}:=\\operatorname{hilb}^d_{\\mathcal{c}_\\beta/ s_\\beta}\\,.\\ ] ] since we assumed that @xmath110 is smooth , our concern is limited to a smooth @xmath127}$ ] .",
    "let us explain why and seem natural .",
    "we regard @xmath128 as the moduli space of the bound system of a @xmath0-brane and @xmath83 @xmath1-branes in the limit where the support curve of the @xmath0-brane is shrinking to a point .",
    "what does the curve look like ?",
    "since we do not expect any @xmath0-brane degree of freedom in the end , the jacobian of the curve must be a point .",
    "so the curve will be a @xmath26 . with the vortex interpretation given in @xcite and to be recalled later , the moduli space of the @xmath0-brane wrapping around @xmath26 and @xmath83 @xmath1-branes sticked to it",
    "should be given by the @xmath83-th symmetric product of @xmath26 or @xmath129 .",
    "therefore if we take into account the location of the shrinking @xmath26 in @xmath21 , we are led to and .",
    "let us turn to the properties of the @xmath0 moduli space .",
    "we assume that @xmath111 is smooth and connected .",
    "there should exist a natural morphism @xmath130 .",
    "intuitively , @xmath111 is the moduli space of @xmath0-branes singly wrapping around fibers of @xmath121 . we expect an intimate connection between @xmath111 and @xmath131 .",
    "we furthermore expect that @xmath111 is independent of @xmath83 and is isomorphic to @xmath132 .",
    "we should have @xmath133 .",
    "hence @xmath134 is the identity map .",
    "we require the existence of a commutative diagram @xmath135\\ar[dr]&\\\\ \\mathfrak{n}_\\beta\\ar[rr]&&s_\\beta}\\ ] ]    for @xmath112 we have by obvious morphisms . for @xmath136",

    "we should have @xmath143    this ends the list of what we demand for @xmath114 to be of simple class .",
    "we now turn to our proposal on the structure of @xmath69 :    by taking into account charge conjugation symmetry , we have @xmath144 where @xmath145 and if @xmath114 is of simple class @xmath146 with @xmath147    this looks like the most natural extension of what we conceived in @xcite .",
    "the reason why we choose the particular sign factor is explained below by comparison with gromov - witten theory .",
    "note that even if @xmath110 is non - empty , @xmath148 can vanish . in our analogy with super kac - moody algebras",
    "this is related to the vanishing of @xmath53 when @xmath38 is not a  positive root \" .    at the moment",
    "we do not know how exactly @xmath149 should be described geometrically when @xmath114 is other than of simple class .",

    "not infrequently we encounter non - trivial formulas of the form @xmath208 so far we have been discussing the product side .",

    "obviously , the sum should be taken over potentially all the @xmath0-@xmath1 states .",
    "so the total @xmath0-@xmath1 moduli space will be relevant .",

    "this is a very explicit and remarkable calculation .",
    "in fact the topological vertex formalism @xcite fits quite nicely into the picture of @xmath0-@xmath1 branes . for a local toric calabi - yau threefold ,",

    "the way several @xmath0-branes are localized to the internal edge @xmath26 s must be treated scheme - theoretically and described by assigning a @xmath212 young diagram to each edge .",
