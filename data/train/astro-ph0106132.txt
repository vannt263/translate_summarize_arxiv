    "methanol masers in the @xmath0 line at 84521.21  mhz were found by batrla and menten  ( 1988 ) and menten  ( 1991 ) towards ngc  2264 , omc-2 , and dr  21 , but no extended survey in this line had been done .",
    "the @xmath0 transition belongs to the class  i ( menten , 1991 ) .",
    "its excitation is similar to that of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 transitions .",
    "since methanol masers emit in several lines of the same class , we expect the detection of a fairly large number of maser sources at 84.5  ghz .",
    "their parameters should be taken into account when modeling maser sources .",
    "therefore , we made a survey of known class  i maser sources at 84.5  ghz .",
    "the observations were carried out in may 1997 and march 2000 with the millimetre - wave telescope of the onsala space observatory . a sample of 13 sources at 84.5  ghz was observed in june 2000 with the 12-m nrao telescope at kitt - peak in remote mode from astro space center .",
    "emission was detected in 51 of the 54 sources observed .",
    "the spectra are markedly different from those of the strongest class  i transition , @xmath4 at 44.1  ghz . at 44.1  ghz ,",
    "most of the sources from our sample have bright and narrow maser features , whereas broad quasi - thermal components dominate at 84.5  ghz , and narrow ( @xmath5 km / s ) features are present in the spectra of only 17 of the 51 detected sources ( fig .",
    "1 ) . however , it is possible that at least some of the quasi - thermal lines contain narrow maser components .",
    "the shape of the 84.5  ghz spectra closely resembles the shape of the spectra of the same sources in the @xmath1 ( valtts  et  al .",
    "1995 ) and @xmath3 ( slysh  et  al .",
    "1999 ) transitions at 95.2 and 132.8  ghz , respectively .",
    "the relationships between the integrated intensities of thermal lines at 84.5 , 95.2 and 132.8  ghz can be fitted by the equations @xmath6 and @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the main - beam brightness temperature .",
    "the relative decrease of the line intensities at 132.8 , and especially at 95.2  ghz , is probably connected with the decrease of level population with increase of their energies : at a gas temperature of 35  k the population of the @xmath9 level is about 40% of the population of the @xmath10 level , making it possible to explain the relationships obtained .",
    "note the detection of narrow features at 84.5 and 95.2  ghz towards the young bipolar outflow l  1157 . unlike other methanol masers , which are associated with high - luminosity young stellar objects ( above @xmath11 ) ,",
    "this one is associated with an object of low luminocity ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "slysh et al . ( 1999 ) showed that even quasi - thermal @xmath3 lines are typically inverted and their quasi - thermal appearance indicates that the line opacities are not large enough to cause significant narrowing . since the excitation of the @xmath0 transition is similar to that of the @xmath3 transition it is possible that the quasi - thermal @xmath0 lines are also inverted . to test this hypothesis , we determined the excitation temperature of the @xmath0 lines using the intensities of the @xmath13 lines at 157.2  ghz , measured by slysh  et  al .",
    "the excitation temperatures were derived analytically using a simple method described by slysh et al .",
    "we applied this method to 20 quasi - thermal sources , and for each , obtained negative excitation temperature between @xmath14  k and @xmath15  k , i.e. , the @xmath0 quasi - thermal lines proved to be strongly inverted .",
    "the excitation temperatures derived in this way are distorted by a number of factors , such as the line opacities , influence of microwave background etc ( slysh  et  al . ,  1999 ) .",
    "therefore , we verified the results using a grid of lvg methanol models spanning the ranges @xmath16  @xmath17 in density , 10100  k in temperature , and @xmath18 @xmath17/(km / s pc@xmath19 ) in methanol density divided by the velocity gradient .",
    "for each source , we selected the models corresponding to the observed ratios of the main - beam brightness temperatures of the @xmath0 line and the @xmath13 and @xmath20 lines , observed by slysh  et  al .",
    "the results are as follows :    for the majority of the sources , we found that only models with inversion of the @xmath0 transition or models with unlikely high methanol abundances satisfy the observed line ratios . in g29.95 - 0.02 , g34.26 + 0.15 ,",
    "ngc  7538 , w  49n , and w  51e1/e2 , the observed intensity ratios can be obtained both in models with the inversion and in realistic models with positive excitation temperatures . however , since a number of models with inversion ( i.e. , same as those for the other 15 sources ) are applicable to these objects as well , it is not clear whether they are somehow different from the others or not .",
    "thus , the quasi - thermal @xmath0 methanol lines , like the @xmath3 lines , are typically inverted .",
    "this result confirms the plausibility of models in which compact class i masers appear in extended sources as a result of an appropriate velocity field ( see , e.g. , sobolev  et  al .",
    "in the series of observations , performed in june 2000 with the 12-m nrao telescope at kitt - peak we tried to find linear polarization at 84.5  ghz towards 13 sources .",
    "we expected that class i methanol masers may arise in a gas permeated by magnetic field and may exhibit a weak linear polarization similar to that of some h@xmath21o masers .",
    "two polarization channels of the 3-mm receiver at kitt - peak can measure both senses of linear polarization simultaneously .",
    "different brightness temperatures , measured in different channels would mean that the radiation is linearly polarized .",
    "one can test whether the difference is a result of linear polarization by tracing the source during a sufficiently long time range .",
    "owing to the diurnal rotation of the sky the direction of the polarization plane will vary , resulting in regular variations of the measured brightness temperatures in the two channels and hence , in a regular variation of the difference between them .",
    "we failed to find any difference between channels in 12 sources and obtained the upper limits for the degree of linear polarization within the range 3%30% .",
    "the only exception is a strong maser m  8e .",
    "here we found a small difference between polarization channels , which might appear due to a weak ( @xmath22 ) linear polarization at 84.5  ghz .",
    "unfortunately , this southern source ( @xmath23 ) can not be traced along a significant part of its diurnal trajectory from the northern hemisphere .",
    "therefore , we could not detect any regular variation of the difference between channels and can not state that the difference is a result of linear polarization .",
    "further polarization measurements of this source at 84.5  ghz are required .",
    "the authors are grateful to the staff of the onsala space observatory and to the staff of the kitt peak telescope for providing help during the observations .",
    "the work was done under a partial financial support of the russian foundation for basic research ( grant no . 95 - 02 - 05826 ) and intas ( grant no . 97 - 1451 ) .",
