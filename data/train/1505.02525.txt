    "spicules have a long and rich scientific history , but their relatively small widths , barely resolved even in modern telescopes , combined with a complex dynamical behavior make spicules a source of lively scientific debate on their origin and role in the solar atmosphere .",
    "traditionally , spicules are observed above the limb in chromospheric spectral lines such as  h  3968    and h@xmath0 . in the traditional picture , spicules are seen to move outward before falling back toward the limb a few minutes later .",
    "typical lifetimes observed are 26  min with typical velocities of 1540  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite suggest that the release of gravitational energy from falling spicules could be the source of heating in the atmosphere and @xcite indicated that significant spicule material could reach coronal temperatures .",
    "@xcite studied euv emission from the downfalling spicule material and indicated that release of gravitational energy is not the primary source of heating in the upper chromosphere .",
    "see @xcite for reviews of older spicule observations and @xcite for a review on the theoretical side of early spicule models .    with the emergence of modern space borne telescopes and telescopes utilizing advanced image post - processing , a wealth of new discoveries has been made .",
    "@xcite used  h  data from the _ hinode _  satellite to discover a different class of spicules , most common in quiet sun regions and coronal hole regions .",
    "these so - called type ii spicules are predominantly seen to move outward from the limb before fading from the observed passband .",
    "their lifetimes are smaller than what was traditionally observed for spicules , usually less than 2  minutes .",
    "the few constraints on the formation of type ii spicules , together with their possible vital contribution to the energy budget ( due to their sheer number density ) have placed type ii spicules at the center of many debates , both regarding their very existence and their formation @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for the fading of  spicules is heating .",
    "@xcite show that the disk counterpart of type ii spicules can be connected to brightenings in the hotter passbands of the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) in addition to  304    from aia .",
    "the spicules continue to evolve after fading from the  h  passband , strongly suggesting that spicules are the site of heating to at least transition region temperatures .",
    "numerical simulations have yet to shed any significant light on this predominantly observational feature , with only one notable exception @xcite . however , numerical experiments will be invaluable in determining in detail the mechanism for formation and heating of spicules . providing observational constraints will help verification and interpretation of simulation efforts and is one of the goals of this paper .",
    "we tackle this issue by looking for answers to the following questions : how common are spicules that disappear from  h  and brighten up in  at the same time ?",
    "are  spicules really that different from  spicules ?",
    "what fraction of  spicules are brighter near the top ?",
    "how do the decelerations of type ii spicules measured in hotter passbands compare with those reported for type i spicules ?",

    "the first dataset is the same as in . at the time of the observations no coronal hole was present on the south pole so the region",
    "is characterized by quiet sun conditions .",
    "the cadences of bfi / sot and aia were 5  s and 12  s , respectively .",
    "we made extensive use of crispex @xcite when studying the observations .",
    "the _ hinode _  and aia data are interpolated to the iris plate scale .",
    "the iris data were rotated by 0.6 degrees relative to the center of the slit - jaw images to compensate for the slightly different orientation between iris and aia .",
    "the images observed with the various passbands are different to a varying degree .",
    "the alignment of the data from the different spacecrafts poses a formidable challenge because there is no common filtergram or one that is sufficiently similar to be used for unambiguous automatic alignment . because we are analyzing limb observations",
    ", we expect that filtergrams formed at different heights to have a spatial offset in the limb - ward direction .",
    "we chose the 1600    channel from aia to serve as a common base for the alignment .",
    "the height of formation of the channels is different in magnetic and non - magnetic regions .",
    "on - disk in non - magnetic regions , the 1600   ,  and  channels are dominated by continuum radiation originating from the upper photosphere , and the  and  passbands are formed at comparable heights ( m. carlsson , private communication , see also @xcite ) . in magnetic regions , however , in particular the  and  channels , and to some extent the 1600    channel , are dominated by line emission from transition region lines , and formation heights are much less confined .",
    "the procedure is then to align iris and _ hinode _  data to each other indirectly through the 1600    channel in non - magnetic regions , because there we expect the channels to be formed at roughly the same height .",
    "a precise alignment between the iris channels is made possible by the fiducial mark on the slit @xcite and the  passband is aligned to the 1600 channel to within a precision of 1 or 2 aia pixels by internal alignment with the use of level 1.5 aia data @xcite .",
    "after various experiments we settled on the following approach : the  to 1600 alignment was done separately for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 direction .",
    "for the @xmath8 direction we used cross - correlation on a subsection of the disk field of view ( fov ) , approximately 470  mm@xmath9 , strictly avoiding network elements .",
    "for the @xmath7 direction we used cross correlation on the entire disk - part of the iris data excluding the slit in the slit - jaw images . to reduce projection effects we put the sub - fov as far from the limb as the data allowed .",
    "cross - correlation on two other , non - magnetic , sub - fovs was done to estimate the uncertainty of the alignment .",
    "we performed the @xmath7 direction cross - correlation on the entire disk - part , including network , elements , as it gave overall better visual alignment compared to only using the sub - fov .",
    "when using the entire disk - part for the @xmath8 direction , the computed shift in @xmath8 direction would be dominated by the magnetic network regions , for which tr line emission results in an ill - determined offset in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "this effect was not visible in the @xmath7 direction , likely because the network - based shifts canceled out because the network features are predominantly oriented along the @xmath8 axis , not the @xmath7 axis .",
    "the  to 1600 alignment was performed manually .",
    "shifts were applied every 285  s , and the shift of the intervening frames were computed from linear interpolation .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty to be within @xmath10 , approximately the same as the aia resolution .",
    "we are not able to achieve sub - pixel accuracy because the images in the channels are not similar enough to compare large - scale patterns .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainty is the same for the  to 1600 alignment .",
    "we remark that after numerous experiments we had to accept a relatively large uncertainty in the final alignment of the datasets . for on - disk multi telescope coordinated observations ,",
    "we have been able to achieve much more accurate alignment to sub - pixel precision ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for future coordinated limb observations we suggest the inclusion of a pure photospheric channel such as the iris 2832 sji and the g - band filtergram on bfi / sot .",
    "we used a temporal grid with 19  s cadence and for each time selected the images closest in time in the different passbands .",
    "19  s was chosen because that was the cadence of the  and  data . for the time of each image we used the middle time of the exposure .",
    "figure  [ fig : fov ] shows an overview of the limb part of the dataset with a dashed red line as a visual aid . for both datasets",
    "the red line is on top of a spicule .",
    "all other thin ( less than 5  mm wide ) features seen sticking out are considered to be spicules . in the first dataset",
    "the red line is on top of a wide structure , wider than most spicules , and in the  and  images we can see hints of substructure , multiple `` threads '' , inside the large structure .",
    "all the `` threads '' move synchronously in time .",
    "@xcite studied similar `` threads '' in higher resolution h@xmath0  data from the swedish 1-m solar telescope and this may be the manifestation of those threads in the  and  passbands .",
    "our general impression from working with these filtergrams is that the  images share characteristics with both the  and  images , making them an excellent diagnostic for detecting spicules .",
    "the large scale structures are similar to the structures in the  image , while many of the small scale features are similar to  structures , and the combination of  and  made it easier to find more spicules in the first dataset compared to the second dataset , which did not include .",
    "many spicules are barely observed in , for example in the region between @xmath11 $ ]  mm in the top example of figure  1 where many clear spicules are visible in  and .",
    "the  image also appears to show many spicules , but the spatial resolution of aia and potentially the optical depth are a clearly a limiting factor in resolving small scale structures .",
    "we also note that the average height at which the lowest point of spicules can be discerned is greatest in the optically thick lines of  and , while considerably lower in  and .",
    "the spicule traced by the red dashed line in the first dataset is clearly visible in all images except , where it appears very faint .",
    "in contrast , the spicule sticking out to the right from the dashed line appears strongest in .    in the second dataset , which contains  but not",
    ", we observe that many spicules in , appear faint and close to the noise level in the data .",
    "there is little spicule substructure visible in the  slit - jaw images .",
    "h  spicules , as observed by hinode , are extremely faint and barely stand out in the original filtergrams .",
    "radial density filters are then employed to enhance their visibility ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "these filters are built by dividing each filtergram by @xmath12 , the normalized mean spatial and temporal intensity as a function of @xmath13 , the distance from the limb .",
    "this greatly increases the contrast between the spicules and their background .",
    "however , @xmath12 is mostly noise for large values of @xmath13 , and dividing the filtergrams by such values becomes meaningless .",
    "therefore , when building the radial filter @xmath12 is scaled so that for large values of @xmath13 it tends to a constant value @xmath0 that is higher than the background noise .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 is largely subjective and determined by visual inspection , so that spicules are enhanced but artefacts and noise are minimized . in and earlier work ,",
    "@xmath14 was used .",
    "spicules in the iris filtergrams are not as faint as in  h , but radial filtering is still important to improve their visibility . in addition , as noted in , spicule trajectories are easier to follow in iris than in  h  because they do not fade as much .",
    "the analysis of space - time diagrams in showed that after fading ,  spicules still showed an extremely faint outline that seemed to match the evolution of spicules in other filters . in this work we investigated this point further and found that this residual spicule signal in  filtergrams can be enhanced by using a more aggressive radial filter . using @xmath15 we get noisier images farther from the limb , but",
    "spicules are seen to extend farther out , to about the same heights as the  or  spicules .",
    "the point of the radial filter is an important one because , as discussed in earlier literature , the height and lifetime measurements of spicules are critically dependent on their appearance as seen in filtergrams .",
    "the two radial filters are compared in figure  [ fig : radial ] .",
    "the very faint spicules seen sticking out from about @xmath16  mm toward the upper left of the image are not identifiable in the non - filtered intensity , and are barely discernible with the radial filter of ( see slight bump in intensity in the lower panel ) .",
    "however , they are seen more clearly with the new filter . by comparing with the intensity along the black dotted column ( serving as an indicator of background intensity level , where no spicules exist at such heights ) , one can appreciate that the spicule signal is very low , comparable to the noise level ( black dotted line ) .",
    "the temporal evolution of this spicule is shown in figure  2 of . making a time series figure equivalent to their figure 2 using our improved radial filter",
    ", we can trace the  spicule component for much longer : up to 456  s with the improved filter , compared to 248  s with the old filter .     for the filters of ( gray ) and this work ( black ) .",
    "the solid gray / black lines show the intensities along the vertical lines of the same color in the panels above ( gray : the radial filter of , black : the radial filter of this work ) , and the solid blue line shows the original non - filtered intensities along the same vertical line . the dotted black line is the intensity along the dotted black line in the middle panel .",
    "the arrows indicate the top of a spicule . ]",
    "we applied the improved radial filter to the  images . for the iris images",
    "there was no advantage in using this more aggressive filter , so we used the same radial filter as in . for the aia  images",
    "no radial filter was applied .",
    "the primary tool we use for analyzing the temporal evolution of spicules is space - time plots , @xmath17-plots , with @xmath7 being the distance along a slit and @xmath18 time . to obtain an @xmath17-plot of the spicules , a slit was manually drawn on the spicules for each time step for a 10  minute duration",
    "this allows for the tracking of the transverse motion of spicules .",
    "the slits were drawn on the  and  images .",
    "due to the alignment uncertainty , we need to take into account that the position of the features can be slightly shifted between the passbands .",
    "to accommodate these small shifts , a slit width of 1@xmath25 was used . for each height in the extended slit ,",
    "the maximum intensity value was computed from the radial filtered images .",
    "we chose the maximum value instead of the average value to avoid the artifacts which then can occur .",
    "for example , if we move the artificial slit from one frame to the next to track a narrow spicule , and the spicule is perfectly centered in the first slit , but is slightly offset in the next , the average value will be shifted to a lower value because more of the dark background is included in the slit .",
    "it was verified that using a smaller or wider slit had little effect on the @xmath17-plots .",
    "the statistics for the spicules were obtained from the @xmath17-plots in all spectral passbands .",
    "the lifetime was defined to be the time difference between the onset and end of the visible spicule , i.e. the lifetime only measures the visible part of the spicule in the @xmath17-plots .",
    "the lifetime of a spicule differs in the different passbands and the lifetimes we measured are a lower estimate of the actual lifetime of the physical event : we can only trace isolated spicules above the `` spicule forest '' and most likely part of the lifetime of most spicules is spent hidden between other spicules .",
    "the minimum height at which the spicules are visible varies between the passbands , and between spicules due to interfering neighboring spicules .",
    "for example , in  the lowest positions of the spicules can often be seen around 4  mm above the photospheric limb , while for  the lowest position is often seen at around 8  mm above the limb .",
    "the way we detected spicules , by searching in all passbands , may give a bias toward the longer lived spicules .",
    "our cadence of 19  s is also not sufficient to detect spicules with lifetimes of less than about a minute . in @xcite ,",
    "the lifetimes were determined based on filtergram inspection .",
    "it is possible that by using @xmath17-plots instead , with the knowledge of the spicule position after it fades in , that a bias toward longer lifetimes is introduced because the faint trails left after the spicule fades might not be associated with the spicule in @xmath19-snapshots at the time .",
    "our length measurement follows the spicule from the top , at time of maximum extent , down toward the limb to the point where the line - of - sight superposition , `` spicule forest '' , obscures the spicule . from that point",
    "the shortest line to the photospheric limb is added .",

    "the upper panel shows an edge - enhanced version of the  image in the bottom panel .",
    "the two dashed lines in each panel both represent an equally good estimate of the velocity ( values printed in the legend ) . ]",
    "we measured the peak ascent velocity by fitting a straight line to the steepest part of the @xmath17-plot .",
    "we applied an edge enhancement algorithm beforehand to the  @xmath17-plot to make the manual extraction easier for the spicules that did not have a clearly defined upper point . because there is a large uncertainty in the manual approach",
    ", we did the measurements twice to estimate the consistency of our results .",
    "the average difference between the two measurements was -2  km  s@xmath1  with a standard deviation of 21  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : peakvel ] illustrates how the velocities were extracted with two different good fits with about 17  km  s@xmath1difference between them .",
    "we measured a total of 54 spicules in the two datasets , 35 in the first and 19 in the second .",
    "the large difference in number of spicules detected is because the second dataset was of shorter duration , but also because  was not observed , which made cross - channel identification harder ( see section  [ sec : observations ] ) .         in figure",

    "we observe that the  spicules fade significantly and that the downward phase is primarily only visible in the iris and aia data .",
    "the parabolic paths in the  data only become apparent after aggressive filtering and it pushes the data to the limits fundamentally set by noise .",
    "it is now clear that the spicules we study are subject of heating .",
    "if we assume that ionization equilibrium is valid in these dynamic events , then the standard estimated temperature ranges for the different passbands would be correct , and we would conclude that we always observe spicules to consist of a mix of chromospheric and transition region temperatures .",
    "however , the dynamic nature of these jets indicates that non - equilibrium ionization may well play an important role , which would change our interpretation of what occurs in spicules .",
    "regardless of the ionization state , our observations support a scenario in which heating is occurring , often toward the top of the spicule .",
    "we measure typical timescales between peak intensity in  and  to be about 3  minutes .",
    "this can be interpreted as a typical time scale for the heating process , although it is possible that non - equilibrium ionization effects could change this value .    in our space - time plots",
    "we generally observe parabolic motions .",
    "the  @xmath17-diagrams often show only the early , more linear , phase of the parabola .",
    "parabolic paths can be the result of driving by shock waves @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to envision a scenario in which magneto - acoustic shocks ( of the type seen in @xcite ) could lead to observations of heating like in our observations . in shocks the heating is occurring at the shock front as it passes through the material , and the aftermath of the shock is responsible for the parabolic motion .",
    "this does not seem to be compatible with our observations .",
    "the  parabolas are generally the most complete , unlike in which often only shows the beginning , and in which is sometimes weak in the beginning and shows increased emission in the later stages .",
    "one can speculate whether this is an optical depth effect : possibly the spicule is optically thick in , but optically thin in  and .",
    "heating of the spicule , not necessarily uniformly across and along the whole spicule structure ( e.g. , in a subset of threads ) , might result in fading from the optically thinner  while there is still sufficient opacity in  in cooler parts of the spicule .",
    "only the hotter part of the spicular plasma can then be seen in .",
    "this observational puzzle puts strong constraints on numerical models .",
    "the increased emission we see in the  @xmath17-plots , often occurring in the downward phase of the spicules , is compatible with previous on - disk observations of an apparent correlation between red - shifted h - alpha spicular plasma and c iv emission @xcite .",
    "it also makes one wonder what role spicules play in the pervasive redshifts observed in transition region lines . this warrants further investigation .",

    "<S> this makes it possible to study their thermal evolution over a large range of temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> a recent study showed that spicules appear in several chromospheric and transition region spectral lines , suggesting that spicules continue their evolution in hotter passbands after they fade from  h. in this follow - up paper we answer some of the questions that were raised in the introductory study . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we study spicules off - limb in  1330    for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we find that  h  spicules are more similar to  2976    spicules than initially reported . for a sample of 54 spicules </S>",
    "<S> , we find that 44% of  1400    spicules are brighter toward the top ; 56  % of the spicules show an increase in  emission when the  h  component fades . we find several examples of spicules that fade from passbands other than  h , and we observe that if a spicule fades from a passband , it also generally fades from the passbands with lower formation temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss what these new , multi - spectral results mean for the classification of type i and ii spicules . </S>"
