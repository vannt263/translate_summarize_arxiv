    "the discovery of the higgs boson provides an explanation for the origin of mass in the charged fermion and gauge sectors of the standard model ( sm ) . however , despite this great success , a number of problems remain .",
    "in particular , our understanding of the origin of neutrino mass is incomplete , and we do not know the constituent properties of the dark matter ( dm ) that appears necessary on galactic scales .",
    "in addition to these puzzles , the origin of the @xmath7  gev mass - parameter that determines the weak scale in the sm also remains a mystery .",

    "the resulting theory provides a common framework for the aforementioned problems relating to mass - namely the origin of neutrino mass , the origin of the weak scale , and the nature of dm .",
    "we investigate the si scotogenic model in detail , demonstrating that viable electroweak symmetry breaking can be achieved , while simultaneously generating neutrino masses and the dm relic abundance .",
    "the model predicts a singlet scalar ( dilaton ) that plays two important roles - it triggers electroweak symmetry breaking and sources the lepton number violation that allows radiative neutrino mass .",
    "important constraints are studied , including those from lepton flavor violating effects , dm direct - detection experiments , and the higgs sector , such as the invisible higgs decay width and higgs - dilaton mixing .",

    "the allowed island at @xmath211  gev corresponds to parameter space that approaches the @xmath31 resonance , such that @xmath212 is around , or just below , the dilaton mass , namely @xmath213 ( the dilaton mass is shown in figure  [ fig : ddet ] ) .",
    "this enhances annihilations into sm final states .",
    "the corresponding enhancement to the @xmath127-channel process @xmath214 , via an intermediate @xmath31 , is not sufficient to overcome the small cubic coupling @xmath215 , as shown in eq .  .",
    "note also that points in the region @xmath216  gev experience some enhancement from the @xmath30 resonance .",
    "such enhancements do not occur in heavier @xmath207 regions , as both the dilaton and higgs are much lighter than the dm . throughout the lighter @xmath207 regions",
    ", the higgs may decay into @xmath217 and @xmath31 final states , though the bound on invisible higgs decays is readily satisfied .",
    "the decay @xmath218 is sufficiently small due to yukawa suppression ( in addition to small @xmath219 mixing ) , as seen from the palette in figure  [ dm]-right , while the decay @xmath220 is suppressed by the small cubic scalar coupling @xmath112 .",
    "next we consider the constraints from direct - detection experiments .",
    "we plot the direct - detection cross section versus the dm mass for the benchmark parameter sets in figure  [ fig : ddet ] .",
    "the mass of the dilaton , @xmath185 , in units of gev , is shown in the corresponding palette .",
    "one immediately observes that direct - detection limits from lux  @xcite impose very serious constraints on the model , with a large number of benchmark sets already excluded .",
    "the plot shows that the surviving benchmark points mostly occur for @xmath221  , with a smaller number of viable points found for @xmath222  .",
    "benchmarks with intermediate @xmath207 values are excluded .",
    "the viable parameter space typically requires a lighter dilaton mass , @xmath223  gev , as all benchmarks with @xmath224  gev are excluded .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the surviving benchmark sets can be probed in forthcoming direct - detection experiments .",
    "versus @xmath225for the benchmarks used previously .",
    "the ellipsoids show the 68% , 95% and 99% cl .",
    ", respectively . in the left frame ,",
    "the palette shows the mixing @xmath226 between the higgs and the dilaton ; in the right frame it shows the relative mass splitting , @xmath227 , for components of the scalar doublet @xmath20.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in figure  [ fig : obl ] we consider the oblique parameters . the variation with respect to the mixing parameter @xmath228",
    "is shown in the left panel .",
    "one notices that the @xmath228 dependence is not the dominant source of variation .",
    "there is some sensitivity to @xmath228 , primarily in @xmath229 .",
    "however , for a given fixed value of @xmath228 , benchmark points occur along the majority of the v - shaped curve traced out in the plot .",
    "thus , the @xmath228 dependence is not driving the variation .",
    "the dependence of the oblique parameters on the dimensionless mass - difference for components of @xmath20 , namely @xmath227 , is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : obl ] .",
    "the plot shows that the majority of the variation in @xmath225 is due to the mass - splitting encoded in @xmath230 .",
    "this is expected .",
    "the @xmath231 parameter is sensitive to isospin violation and thus constrains the splitting for @xmath232 multiplets .",
    "viable benchmark points occur in the region with @xmath233 , as seen in the plot , while larger mass - splittings can conflict with the constraints .",
    "the benchmark points include a range of values for the mass - splitting parameter @xmath230 , giving rise to the variation in figure  [ fig : obl ] .",
    "however , in general , one can take the couplings @xmath234 in the scalar potential sufficiently small to ensure the mass - splitting for @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 is consistent with oblique constraints .",
    "from the ( technical ) naturalness perspective , arbitrarily small values of @xmath26 are allowed , due to the enhanced lepton number symmetry for @xmath63 .. ] natural values of @xmath235 are bounded from below by one - loop gauge contributions to the operator @xmath236 .",
    "consequently the mass splitting for components of @xmath20 is not expected to be smaller than the one - loop induced splitting , which is safely within the bounds .",
    "thus , although the oblique parameters can exclude some regions of parameter space , the constraints are readily evaded .",
    "the exotics in the model can also give new contributions to the higgs decays @xmath12 and @xmath237 .",
    "the ratio of the corresponding widths , relative to the sm values , is plotted in figure  [ fig : hyz ] .",
    "one sees that the overwhelming majority of the benchmark points are consistent with constraints from atlas and cms .",
    "importantly , more - precise measurements by atlas and cms during run ii of the lhc will provide further probes of the model .    before concluding , we note that our analysis reveals considerable differences between the si scotogenic model and the standard ( non - si ) scotogenic model .",
    "these relate primarily to the presence of the dilaton .",
    "the coupling between @xmath18 and the dm provides new annihilation channels for the sterile neutrino dm .",
    "this alleviates the need for larger yukawa couplings @xmath188 , normally required in the scotogenic model to generate the relic density , and reduces the tension with lfv constraints .",
    "however , the dilaton also permits new channels at direct - detection experiments making these constraints more severe for the si model . as a rough guide",
    ", one expects stronger lfv signals for the scotogenic model , and stronger direct - detection signals for the si scotogenic model .",
    "in this work , we performed a detailed study of the minimal si scotogenic model .",
    "our analysis demonstrates the existence of viable parameter space in which one obtains radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , one - loop neutrino masses and a good dm candidate . the model predicts a new scalar with @xmath238 mass .",
    "this field plays the dual roles of triggering electroweak symmetry breaking and sourcing lepton number symmetry violation",
    ". the model can give observable signals in lfv searches , direct - detection experiments , and precision searches for the higgs decays @xmath11 and @xmath239 .",
    "it also predicts a scalar doublet @xmath20 , whose mass is expected to be @xmath240  tev , within reach of collider experiments .",
    "the model is subject to strong constraints from direct - detection experiments ; viable parameter space was found for @xmath241  gev and @xmath222  gev , while intermediate values for @xmath207 appear excluded .",

    "<S> we investigate a minimal scale - invariant implementation of the scotogenic model and show that viable electroweak symmetry breaking can occur while simultaneously generating one - loop neutrino masses and the dark matter relic abundance . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts the existence of a singlet scalar ( dilaton ) that plays the dual roles of triggering electroweak symmetry breaking and sourcing lepton number violation . </S>",
    "<S> important constraints are studied , including those from lepton flavor violating effects and dark matter direct - detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the latter turn out to be somewhat severe , already excluding large regions of parameter space . none the less , viable regions of parameter space </S>",
