    "complex network has gained overwhelming popularity as a powerful tool for understanding various complex systems from diverse fields , including the technical , natural , and social sciences , etc . , which provides a unified perspective or method for studying these systems through modeling them as networks with nodes and edges respectively representing their units and interactions between units  @xcite . generally ,",
    "according to the types of node , networks can be classified into unipartite , bipartite and multipartite networks . as a typical class of real - world networks , bipartite networks , compared to unipartite ones ,",
    "consist of two types of nodes , and edges exist only between distinct types of nodes .",
    "examples of bipartite networks come from various fields , including scientific collaboration networks , actor - movie networks , and protein - protein interaction networks  @xcite .",
    "multipartite networks with more than three types of nodes , are occasionally seen  @xcite .",
    "it has been discovered  @xcite that most real networks share a local clustering feature , i.e. , groups of tight - knit nodes mutually connected to each other with sparser edges .",
    "these groups of nodes are generally referred to as communities or modules . from a topological point of view",
    ", a community may correspond to a functional unit because of its relative structural independence . in turn",
    ", community structure can critically affect diverse dynamics on networks . therefore ,",
    "identification of communities plays a key role in numerous related areas of complex networks , e.g. , predicting protein function  @xcite and determining dynamics of systems  @xcite .",
    "the last few years have witnessed tremendous efforts in this direction  @xcite ( useful reviews include refs .",
    "most previous studies are dedicated to deal with unipartite networks , while little attention has been paid to directed networks  @xcite and bipartite networks  @xcite .",
    "it is of interest that unipartite and directed networks can be represented by bipartite networks as will be shown .",
    "thus , detection of communities in unipartite networks or in directed networks can be transformed into the same task in bipartite networks . given a bipartite modularity , those methods based on modularity maximization  @xcite , in principle ,",
    "can be applied to bipartite networks .",
    "however , they are expected to be affected by the resolution limit  @xcite as in the unipartite case , which may result in the degeneracy problem  @xcite .",
    "this poses a challenge for the methods that return one solution .",
    "instead , we present a modified adaptive genetic algorithm to optimize the bipartite modularity  @xcite . the evolutionary method can return a better solution in a shorter time .",
    "moreover , the method also can return multiple better solutions in multiple runs , which enables us to evaluate the reliability  ( or significance ) of solutions without resorting to other technique as in  @xcite , as well as to obtain a superior solution by combining several better solutions when the degeneracy problem is severe .    in practice , there exist two distinct conceptual understandings of the community structure of a bipartite network .",
    "the first viewpoint for communities in the network is to consider each composed of two types of nodes with dense edges across them , which is similar to the view of unipartite cases  @xcite .",
    "an alternative view is that any community should contain only one type of nodes , which are closely connected through co - participation in several communities that consist of another type of nodes  @xcite",
    ". guided by this view , the usual approach to identifying communities is to project the bipartite network onto one specific unipartite network as needed , and then identify communities in the projection .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite recently presented a method for identifying communities of one type of nodes against the other type of nodes with a known community structure .    in this paper , we focus on dealing with the problem of identifying communities from the first viewpoint .",
    "we present a modified adaptive genetic algorithm ( maga ) , based on the mutation - only genetic algorithm  ( moga ) , which is parameter - free unlike the traditional genetic algorithms .",
    "the method has no need to know in advance the number of communities and their sizes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : modularity ] , we first give a short review of barber s modularity  @xcite and then show that unpartite networks and directed networks can be uniformly represented by bipartite networks .",
    "after the description of the moga in sec .",
    "[ subsec : moga ] , we introduce a different measure for selecting loci to mutate in sec .",
    "[ subsec : newmeasure ] , and then develop the reassignment technique in sec .",
    "[ subsec : reassignment ] .",
    "further , we discuss how to select the population size in sec .",
    "[ subsec : popusize ] and address the issues of convergence and time complexity of the maga in sec .",
    "[ subsec : covergence ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we apply the algorithm to model bipartite networks , several real bipartite networks , and unipartite networks . finally , the conclusion is given .",
    "the modularity introduced by newman and girvan  @xcite aims at quantifying the goodness of a particular division of a given network , and has been widely accepted as a benchmark index to measure and to compare the accuracy of various methods of community detection .",
    "the definition of this quantity is based on the idea that community structure definitely means a statistically surprising arrangement of edges , that is , the number of actual edges within communities should be significantly beyond that of the expected edges of a null model . in turn , a null model should have the same number of nodes and degree distribution as the original network , while the edges of the null model are placed by chance .",
    "let @xmath0 be the degree of nodes @xmath1 , and @xmath2 the total number of edges .",
    "since in the null model  @xcite the probability for an edge being present between nodes @xmath1 and @xmath3 is @xmath4 , the modularity quantifying the extent of the number of actual edges exceeding the expectation based on the null model network , can be formulated as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the sum of the difference over all groups of the particular division , @xmath7 is the network size , @xmath8 indicates the adjacent relation between nodes @xmath1 and @xmath3 , @xmath9 represents the group the node  _ i _ is assigned to , and the @xmath10 function takes the value of 1 if @xmath9 equals @xmath11 , 0 otherwise .",
    "the value of @xmath6 ranges from -1 to 1 .",
    "given a network , a larger value generally indicates a more accurate division of the network into communities .",
    "community structure detection thus can be formulated as a problem of modularity maximization , which often works well although it may suffer from a resolution problem  @xcite .",
    "but on the other hand , due to the resolution limitation and the random fluctuation effect  @xcite , it appears preferable for the divisions delivered by maximization modularity approaches to give an evaluation of their reliability  @xcite .",
    "the above modularity is actually designed for unipartite networks . to be suitable for various networks ,",
    "several variations of modularity based on different null models have been proposed , including weighted  @xcite , directed  @xcite , and bipartite modularity  @xcite .",
    "a bipartite network with @xmath7 nodes can be conveniently denoted by a duality @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively represent the numbers of the two types of nodes .",
    "we can renumber nodes such that in the sequence @xmath15 , the leftmost @xmath13 indices represent the first type of nodes and the remainder represent the second type of nodes .",
    "then , barber s bipartite modularity  @xcite , which considers a community composed of distinct types of nodes in the network , can be written as @xmath16    immediately , a subtle difference between the two modularities in eqs .",
    "( [ eqmodularity ] ) and  ( [ eqbimodularity ] ) can be observed .",
    "it is of interest that a unipartite network can be equivalently represented as a bipartite one , and the bipartite modularity can recover the modularity for the original network . if each node @xmath1 is represented by two nodes @xmath17 and @xmath18 and each edge @xmath1-@xmath3 represented by two edges @xmath17-@xmath19 and @xmath20-@xmath18 , then a unipartite network with @xmath7 nodes and @xmath2 edges is transformed into a corresponding bipartite network with @xmath21 nodes and @xmath22 edges .",
    "for example , the transformation of a simple unipartite network is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_transformation ] .",
    "further , if we label @xmath7 nodes @xmath17 with @xmath23 and label @xmath18 with @xmath24 , then an edge @xmath1-@xmath3 in the original network corresponds to two edges , @xmath1-@xmath25 and @xmath3-@xmath26 . using the bipartite modularity introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eqbimodularity ] ) on the induced bipartite network , we have @xmath27 where we have made use of the fact that the node @xmath17 and @xmath18 should be in an identical community and have the same degree .",
    "thus , bipartite modularity can also be used to community detection in unipartite networks after being transformed .",
    "we then turn to the modularity for directed unipartite networks , which are another important class of networks .",
    "the directed network can analogously be transformed to a bipartite network .",
    "a node @xmath1 is represented by two nodes @xmath17 and @xmath18 as in unipartite networks , while a directed edge from @xmath1 to @xmath3 is represented as an edge between @xmath17 and @xmath19 , that is , set @xmath28 and set @xmath29 are the sources and the sinks . again , using the eq .",
    "( [ eqbimodularity ] ) and the fact above , we obtain @xmath30 where the term on right - hand side in the last equation is just the modularity for directed networks presented in  @xcite .",
    "the method for transforming directed networks into bipartite ones has been proposed by guimer _",
    "@xcite , but their bipartite modularity is distinct from barber s , as mentioned before .    consequently , the bipartite network can be considered as a wider class of networks that provides a generic case for the problem of community structure detection . and barber s bipartite modularity can served as a uniform objective for these methods of identifying communities based on optimization .",
    "as a class of general - purpose tools to solve various hard problems , genetic algorithms have found wide application in bioinformatics , computer science , physics , engineering , and other fields .",
    "they are , based on the darwinian principle of survival of the fittest , a kind of global optimization method simulating evolutionary processes of species in nature  @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary methods are easy to implement , and the process can be described as follows .",
    "the methods start with a stochastically created initial population with predefined size wherein individuals are known as chromosomes representing a set of feasible solutions to the problem at hand , with each associated with a fitness value .",
    "then chromosomes are selected in proportion to their corresponding fitness so that those fitter individuals would will have multiple copies and less fit will be discarded in the new population .",
    "next , genetic operators such as crossover and mutation are performed according to the respective specified ratios on the population .",
    "after these operations , the population of the next generation has been reproduced .",
    "the above process is iterated to evolve the current population toward better offspring until the termination criterion is met .",
    "since the number of divisions on any given network grows at least exponentially in the network size , the optimization of modularity is clearly an np - hard problem that has been given a rigid proof in  @xcite , which has motivated an array of heuristic methods including greedy agglomeration  @xcite , simulated annealing ( sa )  @xcite , spectral relaxation ( sr )  @xcite , extremal optimization  ( eo )  @xcite and mathematical programming  @xcite .",
    "all these methods perform a point - point search , that is , transformation from one solution to a better one , and are susceptible to trapping in a local optimum . in contrast ,",
    "genetic algorithms work with a population of solutions instead of a single solution .",
    "this implies that genetic algorithms are more robust because they perform concurrent searches in multiple directions which would make them effectively find better solutions .    however , for practitioners , a fundamental important problem is to choose appropriate parameters such as crossover rate and mutation rate , because they will seriously affect the performance of genetic algorithms .",
    "furthermore , these parameters are closely related to the studied problems , and even for the same problem , they should adjust themselves in the course of the search . in the following",
    ", we would like to introduce an adaptive genetic algorithm recently presented by szeto and zhang  @xcite and then propose a modified version suited for community structure detection .",
    "traditional genetic algorithms assume that genetic operators indiscriminately act on each locus constituting the chromosome , but this is not always the case .",
    "indeed , the recent research in human dna  @xcite shows that mutation rates at different loci are very different from one another .",
    "inspired by this , ma and szeto  @xcite reported on a locus - oriented adaptive genetic algorithm  ( loaga ) that makes use of the statistical information inside the population to tune the mutation rate at an individual locus .",
    "szeto and zhang  @xcite further presented a new adaptive genetic algorithm , called the mutation only genetic algorithm ( moga ) , which generalized the loaga by incorporating the information about the loci statistics in the mutation operator . in the moga , mutation is the only genetic operator , and the only required parameter is the population size .",
    "the moga was readdressed by law and szeto in  @xcite , wherein it was extended to include a crossover operator . here",
    ", the description for the moga is given on the basis of the later version .",
    "the population matrix @xmath31 has @xmath32 stacked chromosomes with length @xmath33 , with its entries @xmath34 representing the allele at locus @xmath3 of the chromosome @xmath1 at time ( or generation ) @xmath35 .",
    "the rows of this matrix are ranked according to the fitness of the chromosomes in descending order , i.e. , @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "the columns are ranked according to the standard deviation @xmath38  ( its definition will given below ) of alleles at locus @xmath3 such that @xmath39 for @xmath40 . in the moga , the fitness cumulative probability , as an informative measure for chromosome @xmath1 relative to the landscape of fitness of the whole population , was introduced and defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of chromosomes whose fitness values equal @xmath43 .",
    "subsequently , the standard deviation @xmath38 over the allele distribution , as a useful informative measure for each locus @xmath3 , is defined as @xmath44 where the weighting factor @xmath45 reflects the informative usefulness of the chromosome @xmath1 , and @xmath46 is the mean of the alleles at locus @xmath3 , given by @xmath47    a locus with a smaller allele standard deviation was considered to be more informative than other loci , and vice versa .",
    "indeed , this really makes sense in limited situations . for the initial population , the alleles at each locus",
    "@xmath3 should satisfy a uniform distribution , so the standard deviation @xmath38 will be very high while the locus present is not informative .",
    "a typical optimization problem generally allows for a few global optima , so the loci with higher structural information are liable to take fewer alleles than allowed , thereby having smaller allele standard deviations .",
    "therefore , the loci with higher deviations prefer mutating while the other loci  ( informative loci ) remain to guide the evolution process .",
    "now we can describe the process for the moga . in each generation",
    ", we sweep the population matrix from top to bottom . each row  ( a chromosome )",
    "is selected for mutation , with probability @xmath48 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumufitness ] ) , we have @xmath49 .",
    "then , a chromosome with a higher fitness value has fewer chances to be selected , and vice versa . in particular , the first chromosome that has the highest fitness value will never be selected for mutation , while the last one will almost always undergo mutation for a large enough @xmath32 , if @xmath32 normally takes a value from 50 to 100 as de jong suggesed  @xcite , for example , @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "if the current chromosome selected is @xmath1 , then the number @xmath52 of loci for mutation is prescribed as @xmath53 .",
    "thus , a selected chromosome with a higher fitness value has fewer loci to mutate , so that most of the informative loci remain ; while a selected chromosome with a lower fitness value has more less - informative loci to mutate . in practice",
    ", we can mutate the @xmath52 leftmost loci because they are less informative than others according to the above arrangement of loci .",
    "overall , the moga was expected to have a two - fold advantage over traditional genetic algorithms : first , because there is no need to input parameters except the population size it can be more available for solving various problems ; second , the mechanism of adaptively adjusting parameters can make it more effectively perform and obtain better solutions if it works as expected .      despite these possible advantages , the moga can not be directly applied to community structure detection due to a drawback that will be shown .",
    "instead , we present a modified version of the moga , i.e. , the maga , which is especially suited for the problem of community structure detection .",
    "we note that genetic algorithms have been applied to this problem in  @xcite , but these applications are based on standard genetic algorithms  ( sgas ) .",
    "we begin with the encoding schema of the genetic algorithm for finding communities in a bipartite network .",
    "a useful representation is the locus - based adjacency representation presented by park and song in  @xcite where it was used in clustering data and also has been used for community detection  @xcite . in this encoding schema ,",
    "a chromosome consists of @xmath7 loci with a locus for a node in the network , and the allele at a locus @xmath3 is the label of one neighbor of node @xmath3 in the network . in this way , a chromosome actually induces a graph that is often disconnected because of the reduction in connectivity relative to the original network .",
    "given the connectivity of the community , decoding the division from a chromosome then amounts to finding all the connected components of the induced graph . for simplicity",
    ", we also call them the connected components of the chromosome .    .",
    "@xmath54 ( for @xmath55 ) is the allele at the locus representing node @xmath56 , which stands for a neighbor node of @xmath56 in the network .",
    "similarly , @xmath57 ( for @xmath58 ) is the allele at the locus representing node @xmath59 . ]",
    "now , we apply the encoding schema to the case of bipartite networks . given a bipartite network @xmath60 ,",
    "we label its nodes as noted above , i.e. , we label nodes of type @xmath61 with @xmath62 while we label another type of nodes with @xmath63 .",
    "then a chromosome @xmath64 for the network can be represented as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chromosome ] .",
    "since our objective is to find a division with as higher a modularity as possible , the fitness function can be defined directly in terms of the modularity .",
    "based on the above representation for the chromosome , this function becomes @xmath65 where the parameter @xmath66 emphasizes that the division on which the modularity is calculated is encoded by chromosome @xmath64 .",
    "recall that in the moga the allele standard deviation is used to pick the loci to mutate . when applied to community structure detection , however , the measure generally will misguide the algorithm .",
    "consider the simple case in which the population consists only of three chromosomes , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , which in turn consist of four loci that have three alleles .",
    "table  [ tab : example ] shows the allele distribution at these loci .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cumufitness ] ) and ( [ eq : deviation ] ) , the allele standard deviations for the four loci , @xmath70 and @xmath71  ( henceforth , we omit the parameter t for simplicity ) , can be calculated to obtain @xmath72 according to the selection criterion of the loci to mutate in the moga , @xmath73 has the highest standard deviation and will be picked out .",

    "the initial population is generated randomly and each locus follows an approximately random distribution . from the uniform distribution , we have nothing on the structure of the optimal solution to the given problem . with gradual evolution ,",
    "more and more fit members of the population will assume the same alleles at some loci , which may suggest some structural information of the optimal solutions ; that is , the bias  ( or deviation ) from the random distribution indicates the informativeness of the locus . in the simplest case such as the knapsack problem where each locus takes the value 1 or 0 , the allele standard deviation amounts to the bias and",
    "the moga can work well @xcite .",
    "for the current case , loci 3 and 4 should be selected with equally higher priority because their allele distributions are equally closer to their respective random distributions .",
    "both loci 1 and 2 appear with a certain bias on their alleles , indicating that they are more informative than others . if the informativeness of each chromosome is taken into account , however , they are evidently different from one another .",
    "locus 1 has a larger bias since the chromosomes with the same allele 100 , i.e. , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , have higher fitness .",
    "in contrast , locus 2 has a smaller bias since the chromosomes with the same allele 50 , i.e. , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , have lower fitness .",
    "therefore , the correct order of mutation is @xmath75 where the equality means that the pair of loci have the same priority for mutation .",
    "obviously , the allele standard deviation would severely misguide the moga in the current case .",
    "the failure of the allele standard deviation stems from the fact that this measure is closely related to alleles at loci .",
    "however , the information contained in loci is actually not relevant to the particular values but solely determined by the bias relative to the random distribution .",
    "the method of measurement of the bias is thus crucial .",
    "fortunately , we can use the kullback - leibler divergence  @xcite to describe the bias .    in the formalism of the maga",
    ", we explicitly represent a locus @xmath3 as a discrete random variable @xmath76 , and an allele at the locus is a value that @xmath76 can take .",
    "note that in the following the set of all alleles at the locus is denoted by @xmath76 as well .",
    "then the random distribution at the locus can be formally given by @xmath77 let the allele distribution over the population be @xmath78 , defined by @xmath79 we can mathematically define the bias @xmath80 as the kullback - leibler divergence between the two distributions , @xmath78 and @xmath81 : @xmath82 the base of log is irrelevant , but it will change the value of bias , and in the following all the logs are taken to base 2 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the quantity 0log0 should be interpreted as zero . as a kullback - leibler divergence ,",
    "the bias is always non - negative and is zero if and only if @xmath83 . the intuitive explanation is that the amount of information a locus contains is always non - negative , and that we have to roll an unbiased dice if we have not any knowledge about something .",
    "conversely , we can predict that an event will inevitably occur only when we have complete information about it .    reconsidering the above example",
    ", we obtain @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "as a smaller bias indicates poorer information a locus contains , the locus should undergo mutation .",
    "conversely , a larger bias means richer informativeness , and the locus should remain .",
    "therefore , guided by the bias , the order of mutation is locus 3,4,2,1 or 4,3,2,1 , which completely match the order in eq .",
    "( [ eq : correctorder ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it can be observed that locus 2 has zero bias if it has only two alleles .",
    "the difference coming from the change of number of alleles would be normally concealed by the allele standard deviation . for these reasons ,",
    "the bias appears superior to the allele standard deviation .",
    "a better alternative is to use the normalization of the bias as in our maga , which ranges from 0 to 1 being divided by @xmath87 .",
    "it is so far acknowledged that the loci with random distributions should have the highest priority for mutation .",
    "however , in the community detection case this presupposition does not always hold .",
    "after the evolution of a certain number of generations , some communities or their main bodies will appear at the population scale . at present",
    ", a locus with a random distribution does not necessarily imply that it contains no information and should undergo mutation immediately .",
    "generally , there exist in the network many nodes whose neighbors are all  ( or almost all ) in the same communities and have a similar connection pattern or even are structurally equivalent nodes  @xcite that are connected to the same nodes . for such a node ,",
    "if all  ( or most ) of its neighbors presenting in the same connected component predominates in the current population , then the locus has a random distribution or an approximately random distribution .",

    "[ fig : reassignment](b ) , however , such direct altering of the allele will split the original component . to deal with this case , we study the travel in the component along directed edges , starting from the node @xmath3 . since the subgraph elicited from node @xmath3 is connected to the rest of the component through @xmath3 , this travel must end in a node that has passed .",
    "let the path be @xmath98 .",
    "when @xmath99 , we can reestablish the connectivity by removing the last edge , reversing the direction of each edge in the path , and adding a new edge @xmath100 . note that the resultant graph meets with the constraint that any node has only one outgoing edge",
    "therefore , we can reset the alleles at those loci involved in the path . for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : reassignment](b ) , the entire path is @xmath101 , so we can set the alleles according to the path , @xmath102 .",
    "now , the allele at the locus can be set to 1 .",

    "[ fig : reassignment](a ) .    in the reassignment technique",
    ", we can also reassign the contribution from the chromosome to the allele with the maximum label that lies in the same component when performing locus statistics .",
    "more generally , the method can also work as long as we arbitrarily specify a fixed reassignment order for each locus , although different prescriptions may produce different biases .",
    "clearly , the reassignment technique is very useful for community structure detection although it would not work when applied to loci that have a single allele , i.e. , the corresponding nodes in the network are leaves . moreover",
    ", this special case can be readily eliminated by forbidding the mutation , which may bring about the additional merit that it naturally reduces the complexity of the problem .",
    "since most real - world networks are scale - free where substantial number of leaf nodes exist , this merit will be very significant for finding communities in such networks .",
    "as in the moga , the unique parameter required to be provided in the maga is the population size .",
    "the parameter may have significant influence on the application of genetic algorithms .",
    "de jong s experiment on a small suite of test functions showed  @xcite that the best population size was 50 - 100 for these functions .",
    "there are also other empirical studies and theoretical analyses of this parameter  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "de jong s setting has been widely adopted , which may be because this choice gives a good tradeoff between the quality of the solution and the cost of computation in many cases .",
    "this popularity of the setting , however , does not exclude the development of genetic algorithms working with a variable population size .",
    "a few examples of the class of algorithms can be found in @xcite .",
    "although one of these mechanisms may be beneficial to be incorporated into maga , in this work we does not take it into account .    since we expect that all alleles at a locus can simultaneously appear in the population , a population size that is greater than the degrees of most nodes in the network would be preferable . as mentioned before , most real - world networks are scale - free , so the degrees of most nodes in these networks are smaller than 50 .",
    "considering this fact and the cost of large population size , we would like to take a fixed value from the interval between 50 and 200 .",
    "the moga was reported to perform well in the application to solve the knapsack problem  @xcite , where all the loci have two alleles , 0 and 1 . for many cases ,",
    "however , its performance will be hindered by two factors .",
    "one factor is the misguiding by the allele standard deviation mentioned above .",
    "the other is that in the evolution of each generation the fittest individual(s ) actually will not participate in the mutation unless others supersede it  ( them ) .",
    "in fact , despite fulfilling the elite preservation strategy  @xcite that assures convergence for a sga toward the global optimum , the moga does not guarantee such convergence and even may end with a nonlocal optimum solution .",
    "consider a case where the @xmath104 fittest chromosomes have identical fitness and the remaining one has a lower fitness value .",
    "those fittest should be passed to the next generation while the remaining one will mutate with very high probability .",
    "if the mutation happens to produce a chromosome with the same fitness as the others , this will unexpectedly terminate the evolutionary process .    moreover , it is helpful to notice that the present fittest chromosomes , if not a local optimum , always can perform a local search to reach a local optimum . consequently , it is preferable to modify the rule for mutation so as to allow for local search , which refers to performing a random mutation on a single locus .",
    "the mutation operation is powerful in that it may lead to a node moving between different components , a component splitting or two components merging .",
    "interestingly , we found that in many cases it may be useful for the local search to perform a special splitting operation with a low probability  ( for example , 0.1 ) .",
    "the splitting operation on a component drawn randomly can be implemented by a bipartitioning in the spectral method  @xcite .",
    "let the number of edges in the component be @xmath105 .",
    "for the power method , it needs @xmath106 multiplications to converge the lead vector of a matrix of size @xmath7 , which leads to a run time @xmath107 for a bipartition in the spectral method  @xcite . in order to not increase the time complexity of each generation s evolution ,",
    "the multiplication is executed at most @xmath108 times .    combining the above considerations , the overall procedure of the maga for community detection",
    "can be described as follows .",
    "( 1 )  the connectivity of the network of interest is fed into the maga .",
    "the algorithm then creates @xmath32 initial feasible solutions , each locus of which is initiated with a random allele .",
    "( 2 )  at each generation , the maga first duplicates 10% the fittest chromosomes of previous generation for the current generation .",
    "( 3 )  the maga then reproduces @xmath109 individuals by selecting from the previous generation in proportion to their fitness to prepare for mutation .",
    "( 4 )  the fitness and the fitness cumulative probability for chromosomes are evaluated using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fitness ] ) and  ( [ eq : cumufitness ] ) , respectively ; immediately , the bias for each locus using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) and  ( [ eq : allele - newdistr ] ) is evaluated , and then these loci are ranked according to their biases .",
    "( 5 )  the individuals reproduced in step 3 are swept , and the chromosome @xmath1 selected with the same probability @xmath110 as in the moga ; if the chromosome is chosen then the mutation aforementioned is performed , otherwise a local search for the fitter individuals is performed .    ( 6 )  steps 25 are repeated until a certain termination criterion has been met .",
    "otherwise , the maga outputs the best partition with the highest fitness .    since in step 3",
    "the fitter individuals incline to be reproduced because of their higher fitness , step 4 enables the reproduced fittest individuals always to perform a local search .",
    "step 2 maintains the elite preservation strategy in case of the destruction of the strategy in step 5 . in this way",
    ", the maga not only can converge to the global optima , also can speed up the process .",
    "the most time - consuming operations in each generation are evaluating the bias and fitness with @xmath111 time , and ranking the loci with @xmath112 time .",
    "this ranking operation has seemingly slightly higher complexity than an @xmath111 operation if the network is sparse .",
    "in fact , it can be performed faster than those operations with @xmath111 time since the latter need to be repeated @xmath32 times .",
    "therefore , the overall time cost for each generation of the maga is @xmath111 like that of sgas .",
    "in this section , we empirically study the effectiveness of the maga by applying it to model bipartite networks and several real bipartite networks . in both cases , we show that maga is superior to sgas and the moga  @xcite , and it also can compete with the nice brim  ( bipartite , recursively induced modules )  @xcite algorithm that dedicated to bipartite networks .",
    "we also tested the performance on several real unipartite networks , comparing with several well - known methods for unipartite networks in the literature .      to test",
    "how well our algorithm performs , we have applied it to model bipartite networks with a known community structure .",
    "a model network can be constructed in two steps .",
    "the first step is to determine the layout of nodes in the network , i.e. , to specify the number of communities @xmath113 , and the numbers of nodes of two types included in each community @xmath114 and @xmath115 , as well as to assign group membership to these nodes .",
    "next , the dispersion of edges is determined by specifying the intracommunity and intercommunity link probabilities @xmath116 and @xmath117 , such that @xmath118 .    for simplicity ,",
    "all communities assume the same values of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "we set @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 as used in  @xcite .",
    "one might expect that as @xmath116 is markedly greater than @xmath117 the networks exemplifying the model have significant community structure that tends to be detected .",
    "conversely , as @xmath117 approaches @xmath116 , the network examples become more uniform and their modular structure becomes more obscure . in this experiment , @xmath116 is fixed at the value of 0.9 while @xmath117 is varied by tuning @xmath122 from 0.1 to 0.9 with steps of 0.1 .",
    "we have tested on such models the performance of the maga as well as of the sga and the moga , each exemplified with ten networks . on each example we ran these algorithms ten times .    for evaluating the quality of solutions , both the modularity and the normalized mutual information  ( nmi )  @xcite are useful .",
    "but the nmi is more suitable for the current case since the optimal  ( correct ) division of the model network is known in advance .",
    "this measure takes its maximum value of 1 when the found division perfectly matches with the known division while it takes 0 , the minimum value , when they are totally independent of each other .",
    "accordingly , we employed the stop criterion that the algorithms reach the predefined generation size  ( maximum number of generations ) or the nmi reaches its maximum value .     and @xmath123 .",

    "[ sec : modularity ] means that the maga can also more effectively optimize unipartite modularity so that we only focus on the comparison with those well - known methods , including the girvan - newman ( gn ) algorithm  @xcite , eo  @xcite , sr  @xcite , and sa  @xcite .    to test the performance of the maga on unipartite networks , we have considered several real networks with different scales : the zachary karate club network  @xcite , the jazz musicians network  @xcite  ( jazz )",

    "shown in table  [ tab : unipartite ] , the maga almost consistently outperforms the eo and sr methods for these networks .",
    "interestingly , for the zachary network the maga found the accurate solution with @xmath141  @xcite , while neither the eo nor sr nethod can find it in spite of the fact that the network is very simple .",
    "furthermore , for the larger networks the gap in performance tends to widen ; for example , the maximum modularity difference approaches 18% ( 11% ) relative to the eo  ( sr ) method for the largest network studied .",
    "even when compared with sa method , which is widely considered as the most accurate modularity maximization method , the maga may give a higher modularity while significantly reduce the time cost .",
    "in fact , the sa method theoretically allows finding the global optima of modularity , but the exponential complexity restricts it only to finding a better local optimum and to resolving the network of scale only up to @xmath142 .",
    "the performance of the sa listed in table  [ tab : unipartite ] was reported in running on an intel pc with two 3.2 ghz processors in  @xcite , wherein the authors proposed an accurate method that can be competitive with the sa method but has very high memory demand .",

    "we have shown both that unipartite and directed networks can be equivalently represented as bipartite networks , and their modularity is just the corresponding bipartite modularity .",
    "this implies that bipartite networks can be considered as an extensive class of networks including unipartite and directed networks , and that detecting communities in bipartite networks provides a uniform framework for solving the problem in various networks .",
    "therefore , methods for detecting community structure of bipartite networks generally can be applied to unipartite and directed networks .",
    "we have presented an adaptive genetic algorithm , the maga , for the task of community structure detection .",
    "this algorithm is based on the moga which was presented with the aim of improving the performance of traditional genetic algorithms .",
    "but we have shown that the moga has a poor performance as applied to this task .",
    "in fact , we have revealed the moga would be misguided by the allele standard deviation and does not guarantee the convergence to global optima . in the maga",
    ", we introduced a different measure for the informativeness of loci , a modified rule for mutation and a reassignment technique .",
    "these ingredients jointly make the maga more effectively optimize objective function for community structure detection .",
    "the experiments on bipartite ( model and real ) networks have consistently shown that the maga outperforms the moga , sga , and brim .",
    "compared to brim , another advantage is that the maga can automatically determine the number of communities . the results on unipartite networks indicate that the global optimization method is indeed more accurate than the eo and sr methods as expected , and that it also can attain or even outperform the accuracy of the sa method in a significantly shorter time , which is crucial for analyzing large networks .",
    "the time complexity of each generation evolution of the maga is @xmath111 , and the overall time demand of this algorithm depends on the population size and the generation size  @xcite . although the maga can theoretically find the global optima of an objective function , the quality of solutions delivered by the maga rests in practice on the generation size given the population size .",
    "owing to the lower complexity of each generation evolution , we can run enough generations to get a high - quality solution .",
    "empirical results showed that the maga can effectively resolve the community structure of networks at many scales up to @xmath143 , which have covered many kinds of real networks such as social , metabolic , and technology networks . beyond these scales",
    "there are several nice local methods available @xcite , while the performance of our algorithm on networks with such scales needs to be further explored . on the other hand ,",
    "since a parallel implementation of the maga allows each of the most time - consuming operations on @xmath32 chromosomes to be simultaneously calculated by assigning them to multiprocessors of a highly efficient computer , it seems that even for networks of millions of nodes the maga is still a promising method for accurate detection of their community structure .",
    "methodologically , the maga for community detection is based on the idea of optimization .",
    "so the accuracy is determined by the selection of an objective function . here , we use the ( bipartite ) modularity as the object to optimize , which certainly may suffer from the resolution problem although this may not be severe for many real networks . on the one hand ,",
    "the resolution problem essentially is favorable for gaining deeper insight into the structure of networks  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of this problem may be circumvented or alleviated as needed .",
    "for example , the maga can perform network preprocessing with random walk  @xcite before optimizing or take an alternative objective function  @xcite instead of the modularity .",
    "also we can combine several high - quality solutions to obtain a more accurate division of the network of interest  @xcite .",
    "overall , the maga enables us to accurately and effectively detect community structure for various networks including bipartite , unipartite , directed , and weighted networks so long as it takes the corresponding modularity as the fitness function .",
    "the evolutionary method can return multiple high - quality solutions with no bias , which may provide some useful information on the reliability of the solutions of interest and may be combined in a way to obtain a better solution .",

    "<S> second , we develop a reassignment technique for differentiating the informative state a locus has attained from the random state in the initial phase . </S>",
    "<S> third , we present a modified mutation rule which by incorporating related operation can guarantee the convergence of the maga to the global optimum and can speed up the convergence process . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results show that the maga outperforms existing methods in terms of modularity for both bipartite and unipartite networks . </S>"
