    "understanding the pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles is one of the fundamental , still unsolved , puzzles in particle physics . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "yukawa couplings are arbitrary free parameters and therefore , in order to shed any light into the fermion mass puzzle , physics beyond the sm is required .",
    "the traditional approach to the fermion mass issue @xcite consists of adding spontaneously broken flavour symmetries ( gauged or global ) to the sm . the symmetry and the pattern of symmetry breaking then leads to predictions for the fermion masses and mixing angles ( or at least to correlations among them ) .",
    "recently , arkani - hamed and schmaltz ( as ) @xcite suggested a novel approach to the flavour puzzle , in the framework of large , extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "they suggest that we live in a `` fat '' four - dimensional subspace ( fat - brane ) , which is infinite in the usual four space - time dimensions and possesses a finite volume in the extra , orthogonal dimensions . in this scenario ,",
    "the higgs boson and the gauge fields are free to propagate in the entire fat - brane , while fermions have higher dimensional wave - functions which are localised in specific points in the extra dimensions @xcite . therefore , the effective four - dimensional yukawa coupling between two fermion species turns out to be ( very efficiently ) suppressed if the fermions are localised in different points , due to the small overlap of their respective wave - functions . within this scenario ,",
    "it is possible to start from a set higher - dimensional yukawa couplings of order one , and obtain strong and specific fermion mass hierarchies simply by appropriately choosing the position of the fermionic fields .",
    "it has been shown that this unorthodox proposal not only is capable of reproducing the correct pattern of quark masses and mixing angles @xcite , but that it also has potential ( and rather unique ) experimental signatures @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of cp violation in the as scenario .",
    "we argue that , if the fermions are localised in different points in a one dimensional subspace ( line ) , it is not possible to obtain sufficient cp violation in order to accommodate the current experimental data .",
    "we perform our analysis in the so - called nearest - neighbour - interaction ( nni ) basis @xcite , and illustrate the source of difficulties which are encountered in the context of only one extra dimension .",
    "finally , we consider models with two extra dimensions and give an example where all quark masses and mixing angles are correctly reproduced , along with the required strength of cp violation .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in sec .  2 we briefly review the as scenario , paying special attention to the choice of weak basis and its interpretation . in sec .",
    "3 we show what is required in order to obtain the correct strength of cp violation , while reproducing the observed pattern of quark masses and mixing angles . in sec .  4 we summarise our results and present our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we briefly present the fat - brane paradigm , and discuss how it can be used to solve the fermion mass puzzle .",
    "it is instructive to start from the @xmath1-dimensional action @xcite for two fermion fields : @xmath2q + \\bar{u}[i\\gamma_m\\partial^m+\\phi^u(y)]u + \\kappa hq^cu,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the `` ( anti)quark '' fields , @xmath5 is the ( higher - dimensional ) higgs field and @xmath6 the higher - dimensional yukawa coupling .",
    "@xmath7 are the @xmath1-dimensional version of the dirac matrices ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xmath9 are potentials for the quark fields , and are such that the quarks are confined to specific `` points '' in the extra dimension .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details . after expanding @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 in its `` normal modes '' ( properly normalised ) ,",
    "the yukawa part of the action for the zero - modes is @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the fifth dimensional wave - functions for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the four - dimensional higgs , @xmath15 and @xmath16 fields , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that the higgs zero - mode is independent of @xmath17 , the extra dimension .",
    "assuming @xmath11 to be gaussians centred at @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , with width @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 where the second equality is valid when the thickness of the brane ( range of @xmath17 ) is significantly larger than @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the effective four - dimensional yukawa coupling is then of the form @xmath24 .",
    "the exponential factor obtained from eq .",
    "( [ exp_factor ] ) is of key importance , since it allows for ( exponentially ) suppressed yukawa couplings even when the original higher - dimensional couplings are of order one , if the different quark fields are confined at different points in the extra dimension .",
    "such mechanism is capable of not only generating very small yukawa couplings , but may also be used to suppress dangerous higher - dimensional operators mediating proton decay , @xmath25 mixing , etc @xcite , which normally plague theories with a small fundamental scale .",
    "a pertinent question is whether there is any geometrical configuration of quark fields which fits all quark masses and mixing angles .",
    "this issue was addressed in @xcite , and the answer is positive .",
    "therefore , without assuming any flavour symmetry ( _ i.e. _ all @xmath6 of order one ) , it is possible to accommodate the observed pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles simply by appropriately placing each quark field in a different position .",
    "we address the issue of the quark yukawa matrix in more detail in order to discuss a few relevant points .",
    "first , we choose a basis where the weak charged current is diagonal , such that @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the quark doublets , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 the up - type and down - type antiquark singlets , respectively ( @xmath30 for the three families ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ exp_factor ] ) , @xmath31 ( repeated indexes not summed over ) .",
    "the same holds for @xmath32 with @xmath33 replaced by @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , as was mentioned previously , if all @xmath35 are of order one , the whole texture of the yukawa matrix is dictated by the relative distance of @xmath15 s and @xmath16 s , @xmath36 s .",
    "an important comment is that the exponential factors dramatically affect the otherwise arbitrary moduli of the higher - dimensional yukawa couplings , but they do nothing to potentially large complex phases .",
    "therefore , in general terms , each element of @xmath37 is accompanied by arbitrary , unsuppressed complex phases .",
    "another interesting point is that , since in the as framework quark fields are localised in different places , families are distinguishable , at least in principle , even in the limit where all yukawa couplings vanish . as a result",
    ", there is no freedom to rotate the fermion fields in family space ( no @xmath38 global symmetry ) .",
    "ultimately a weak basis ( wb ) will be dictated by the localising mechanism for the fermion fields .",
    "however , one can still refer to different choices of wb which should be understood as corresponding to different assumptions about the underlying physics .",
    "within the as approach to the yukawa puzzle the choice of wb plays a crucial r^ ole . it is worthwhile to comment on what wb choices are more appropriate for the fat - brane scenario .",
    "let us recall that in the standard approach to the fermion mass problem , flavour symmetries added to the sm lead to : @xmath39-zeros in the yukawa matrices , resulting from terms forbidden by the flavour symmetry and/or @xmath40-equality and/or relations between elements in the yukawa matrices , which are connected by the flavour symmetry .",
    "in the as approach , as discussed in the previous section , it is quite natural to obtain effective zeros in the yukawa matrices , since they correspond to elements which connect fermions which are very `` far '' from one another . on the other hand , equalities or specific relations among elements of the yukawa matrices",
    "are not `` natural '' in the as scheme ",
    "they require fine - tuned choices for the positions of the fermion fields in the extra dimensions .    from the above considerations ,",
    "one is led to conclude that , within the fat - brane framework , the most convenient wb are those which contain a large number of zeros , while bases where the fermion mass matrices are either symmetric or hermitian are not adequate .",
    "two especially interesting bases are the nearest - neighbour - interaction ( nni ) basis , @xmath41 and the triangular ( t ) basis , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the down - type and up - type mass - matrices ( after electroweak symmetry breaking ) with complex entries .",
    "it should be emphasised that , in the sm , both the nni @xcite and t forms correspond to a choice of wb , in the sense that starting from arbitrary mass matrices @xmath44 and @xmath43 one can always perform transformations of the type @xmath45 where the @xmath46 s are unitary matrices , which transform @xmath44 and @xmath43 into the nni or the t form while leaving the weak currents diagonal in flavour space ( note that @xmath47 is the same matrix in @xmath44 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "recently , mirabelli and schmaltz @xcite ( ms ) performed what they referred to as a `` brute force '' scan over the parameter space in the framework of one extra dimension , and found the following mass matrices @xcite : @xmath48 where the zeros correspond to elements strongly suppressed by exponential factors .",
    "these matrices lead to the correct values for quark masses and mixing angles .",
    "we now address the issue of cp violation , which was not discussed in @xcite . in order to do so",
    ", we assume that all entries in @xmath44 and @xmath43 are complex , with arbitrary phases ( as discussed in sec .  2 ) .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ ms_matrix ] ) , one obtains , to a very good approximation , @xmath49    for any arbitrary set of quark mass matrices , in the weak basis where @xmath50 is diagonal , all @xmath51",
    "have physical meaning and can be expressed as a function of quark masses and mixing angles . in particular one",
    "has @xmath52 where @xmath53 are elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . since in the ms ansatz @xmath54 vanishes , from eq .",
    "( [ h12 ] ) together with unitarity of the ckm matrix , one obtains @xmath55 and @xmath56 eq .  ( [ ms ] ) corresponds to relation ( 7.12 ) of reference @xcite , which was derived in a slightly different way , while eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) implies that there is no cp violation in the solution found in @xcite ( namely , eq .  ( [ ms_matrix ] ) ) .",
    "an alternative way of showing that cp is not violated is by evaluating the following wb invariant @xmath57 ^ 3=6i(m_u^2-m_c^2)(m_t^2-m_c^2)(m_t^2-m_u^2 ) \\mbox{im } ( h^d_{12}h^d_{23}h^{d*}_{13})=0,\\ ] ] where the first equality is obtained in the wb where @xmath50 is diagonal while the second equality results from the fact that @xmath54 vanishes in this ansatz .",
    "the vanishing of the above invariant is a necessary and sufficient condition @xcite for @xmath58-invariance in the sm .",
    "note that @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ ms_matrix ] ) has the nni form , and this is why @xmath54 vanishes .",
    "this , in turn , implies that eq .",
    "( [ ms ] ) has a much larger range of applicability than the ansatz presented in @xcite , being valid for any model where @xmath43 has the nni form while @xmath50 is diagonal .",
    "one may wonder whether our conclusion about the absence of cp violation in the ms ansatz is affected by the fact that @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ ms_matrix ] ) is not exactly diagonal .",
    "it can be readily seen that taking @xmath44 diagonal is a very good approximation ( as argued in @xcite ) , so that when one considers the effect of the off - diagonal terms , the resulting strength of cp violation is always too small to account for the experimentally observed value of @xmath59 @xcite . indeed , if one allows for complex arbitrary phases in the entries of @xmath43 , @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ ms_matrix ] ) , one can readily derive an upper bound on the strength of cp violation , namely @xmath60 .",
    "this is to be compared to @xmath61 , required by the experimental value of @xmath59 .",
    "we now proceed with a systematic study of fermion mass matrices in the as scheme .",
    "we shall work in the nni basis defined at the beginning of this section by eq .",
    "( [ nni_basis ] ) and assume that the entries of @xmath44 and @xmath43 have arbitrary phases .",
    "at this point one should mention that although the ms example of eq .",
    "( [ ms_matrix ] ) is not explicitly written in the nni basis , a simple wb transformation consisting of the permutation of the first two columns transforms their ansatz into the nni form .",
    "geometrically this transformation corresponds to the interchange of positions between @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the extra dimension .",
    "the relative positions of the quark wave - functions giving rise to the nni basis in one dimension are depicted in fig .  1 , which is to be compared to fig .  5 in @xcite .",
    "[ fig:1-dim ]    since , in the sm , there are no right - handed currents , the mass spectrum and the ckm - matrix only depend on @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which have the following form in the nni basis : @xmath66 by making a transformation of the type @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a diagonal unitary matrix , it is possible to eliminate all complex phases from @xmath50 , while the off diagonal elements of @xmath69 still have arbitrary phases . in this case",
    ", both matrices are diagonalized in the following way , @xmath70 where the @xmath71 s are orthogonal matrices and @xmath72 is a unitary diagonal matrix whose r^ ole is to eliminate the phases in @xmath69 . without loss of generality , one may choose @xmath73 .",
    "the ckm matrix is , therefore , given by @xmath74 the relevant elements for our discussion can be explicitly written as @xmath75    in order to check whether it is possible to obtain , with only one extra dimension , sufficient cp violation , we have done a series of guided trials using eqs .",
    "( [ vus])-([vtd ] ) and taking into account the observed quark mass spectrum .",
    "soon it became apparent that this it is not possible with only one extra dimension .",
    "this can be understood by the following argument .",
    "since we are working in the nni basis ( where @xmath54 vanishes ) , the only way to obtain sufficient cp violation is by having , in the same basis , @xmath50 significantly deviating from the diagonal .",
    "this in turn requires more proximity between the @xmath28 s and @xmath76 s .",
    "once the @xmath28 s get close enough to the @xmath76 s there is no room to place the @xmath77 s along the same line ( since the @xmath76 s are now closer to each other ) while at the same time obtaining the correct masses and mixing . indeed with only one extra dimension",
    ", we have not found any solution significantly different from the one proposed by ms , which would correctly reproduce the quark masses and mixing angles .",
    "this confirms the uniqueness of the ms solution ( modulo wb transformations on right handed quark fields ) , in the case of only one extra dimension .      in the search for a solution with two extra dimensions",
    ", we shall continue to work in the nni basis and look for configurations of the quark fields where the ckm matrix arising from eq .",
    "( [ vckm ] ) , although dominated by @xmath78 , receives a significant contribution from @xmath79 .",
    "as we have previously argued , for nni quark mass matrices , the existence of a non - negligible contribution from @xmath79 is essential in order to be able to generate sufficient cp violation .",
    "it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ du]),([dd ] ) that the orthogonal matrices @xmath79 , @xmath78 are determined by the relative positions of the quark fields in the extra dimension space , while the phases @xmath80 and @xmath81 are free parameters .",
    "both the modulus and the argument of @xmath82 crucially depend on the phase @xmath80 , while @xmath81 does not play much of a r^ ole in the determination of @xmath82 , due to the smallness of the factor @xmath83 ( as will be seen later ) . on the other hand , for the elements @xmath84 and @xmath85 , both @xmath80 and @xmath81 potentially play an important r^ ole .",
    "[ fig:2-dim ]    we have found an interesting set of locations for the quark fields which leads to the right spectrum of quark masses and pattern of mixing angles , while allowing for the right strength of cp violation .",
    "the locations of the quark fields in the two extra dimensions are depicted in fig .",
    "2 . explicitly ,",
    "@xmath86 which lead to the following masses matrices , assuming @xmath87 , for all @xmath39 and @xmath88 ( see @xcite for details regarding this choice ) : @xmath89 where the zeros correspond to strongly suppressed matrix elements . from eq .",
    "( [ choice ] ) one readily obtains @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the allowed range of values for @xmath80 is essentially dictated by the experimental value of @xmath90 , @xmath91 indeed from eq .",
    "( [ choice ] ) it follows that @xmath92 from eqs .",
    "( [ vus ] ) , ( [ range ] ) , and ( [ ouod ] ) , it follows that @xmath80 is constrained to be in the range @xmath93 while @xmath81 does not play much of a r^ ole in the determination of @xmath94 , since @xmath95 .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "we choose @xmath80 in the first quadrant in order to obtain the appropriate sign for @xmath96 .",
    "[ fig : vus ]    it is remarkable that in order to obtain the correct value of @xmath94 one is led to a large value of @xmath80 which in turn is crucial to have a sufficient amount of cp violation .",
    "for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , we have obtained @xmath99 the strength of cp violation can be readily evaluated : @xmath100    the values of the quark masses implied by eq .",
    "( [ choice ] ) are @xmath101 corresponding to the quark masses evaluated at the common scale @xmath102 .",
    "these are in agreement with the experimental values of the quark masses ( computed in the @xmath103 renormalization scheme , with up , down , and strange quark masses evaluated at a scale of 2 gev and the others evaluated at a scale equal to their @xmath103 mass ) , as compiled by the particle data group @xcite : @xmath104 when one takes the effect of renormalization group running into account . in order to do this",
    "we use scaling factors @xmath105 such that @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "these have been computed to three loops in qcd and one loop in qed @xcite , and are given by @xmath110 one comment which should be made at this point is that the fact that @xmath50 in the example discussed is not diagonal leads to a correction of order 10% in the value of @xmath111 implied by eq .",
    "( [ ms ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the possibility of having sufficient cp violation with the triangular basis .",
    "as far as obtaining the correct mass spectrum and mixing angles , it was already pointed out @xcite that the t basis requires at least two extra dimensions .",
    "although we have not studied this case in detail , we do not anticipate , a priori , any difficulty in obtaining the right amount of cp violation as well .",
    "a novel approach to the fermion mass puzzle was recently proposed in the context of large extra dimensions by arkani - hamed and schmaltz ( as ) @xcite and further analysed by mirabelli and schmaltz @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the fermion mass hierarchy and mixing pattern are a consequence of the fact that different fermionic fields are localised in slightly different points in the higher dimensional space .",
    "although at this stage there is no fundamental understanding of why various fermions would be localised at different positions , the proposed paradigm provides a new and drastically different approach to the yukawa puzzle .    in this paper",
    "we addressed the issue of cp violation in the as framework .",
    "first , we considered a specific example proposed by mirabelli and schmaltz ( ms ) which leads to the correct quark mass spectrum and mixing angles , in the framework of one extra dimension .",
    "we showed that in the ms example , even if one allows for complex mass matrices with arbitrary phases , one can never generate sufficient cp violation through the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism .",
    "we performed our analysis in the nearest - neighbour - interaction ( nni ) weak basis ( wb ) , which is well suited for understanding fermion masses in the as scheme .",
    "in fact , we showed that although the ms quark mass matrices are not written in the nni basis , they can be transformed into that form by a simple wb transformation interchanging two columns of the up quark mass matrix .",
    "we also showed that a specific relation between quark masses and mixing angles ( see eq .",
    "( [ ms ] ) ) obtained by ms , can be derived in a more general framework which goes beyond the specific ms ansatz .",
    "a systematic search was conducted with one extra dimension and quark mass matrices written in the nni weak basis and it was shown that again it is not possible to generate sufficient cp violation .",
    "we then considered the case of two extra dimensions and constructed an example where the location of the fermion fields leads to the correct mass spectrum and mixing angles , while allowing for the generation of sufficient cp violation to account for the experimental value of @xmath59 . in the example",
    "considered , one is led to a striking connection between the value of @xmath90 and the strength of cp violation .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on lepton masses and mixing .",
    "although the fat - brane approach can also provide an understanding of the hierarchy of lepton masses , the observed large mixing in the neutrino sector , together with the fact that neutrinos can also be majorana particles represents a further challenge @xcite to the as approach .",
