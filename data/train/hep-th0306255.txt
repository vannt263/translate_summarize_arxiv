    "recently , there has been much interest in formulating chern - simons theories on non - commutative manifolds @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the non - commutative cs theory has been used for the purpose of obtaining a new description of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) .",
    "polychronakos @xcite and morariu and polychronakos @xcite have proposed finite - dimensional matrix models of cs theory and used them to explain certain properties of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) .    in this paper",
    "we report on our work on the formulation of non - commutative cs theory where the spatial slice , an infinite strip , is a manifold with boundaries .",
    "it can serve to describe non - commutative qhe in such a strip .",
    "there have been previous attempts to carry out such a formulation on a disc and on a half plane in the presence of spatial non - commutativity @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle faced in these attempts can be traced to the absence of a well - defined @xmath15-product for these types of manifolds .",
    "we discuss this problem in the beginning of section 3 in some detail to better explain our motivation and the need for the matrix cs model we introduce afterwards .",
    "recently , pinzul and stern @xcite have studied the cs theory written on a non - commutative plane with a ` hole ' .",
    "they have shown that in this case the algebra of observables is a nonlinear deformation of the @xmath16 algebra . in another work @xcite , lizzi , vitale and zampini",
    "have formulated a fuzzy disc , on which the non - commutative cs theory can be formulated .",
    "it has overlaps with our work here and has also points of contact with @xcite .",
    "our model stems from taking gauge fields as operators supported on an @xmath17-dimensional subspace of the hilbert space , where @xmath18 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is spanned by the eigenstates of a simple harmonic oscillator associated to the underlying moyal plane .",
    "the resultant matrix cs model has a fuzzy edge and it becomes the required sharp edge when @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a suitable sense . the non - commutative cs theory on the strip is defined by this limiting procedure . in this framework",
    "we perform the canonical constraint analysis for the finite - dimensional matrix cs model and find out that there are edge observables in the theory generating a lie algebra with properties similar to that of a non - abelian kac - moody algebra .",
    "our study shows that there are @xmath6 `` abelian '' charges ( observables ) given by the matrix elements @xmath19 and @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) of the gauge fields , that obey certain standard canonical commutation relations .",
    "in addition , the theory contains three unique `` non - abelian '' charges , localized near the @xmath10 level .",
    "we show that all `` non - abelian '' edge observables , except these three can be constructed from the @xmath20 `` abelian '' charges above . using some of the results of this analysis we discuss in detail the limit where this matrix model approximates the cs theory on the infinite strip .",
    "finally , we discuss the commutative limit of our model , where we also give a closed formula for the central charge of the kac - moody - like algebra of the non - commutative cs theory in terms of the diagonal coherent state matrix elements of operators and star products .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows : in section 2 we start with a brief review of the formulation of edge currents in a commutative cs theory on an infinite strip .",
    "here we also demonstrate how one can formulate these edge effects while working on the full plane and encoding the boundary structure in the test functions .",
    "the next three sections systematically develop the ideas outlined in the last paragraph .",
    "we conclude with highlighting the main results of our work and their possible physical significance .",
    "here we briefly review the derivation of kac - moody algebra obeyed by edge observables in an abelian chern - simons theory .",
    "results summarized in this section are well - established and extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "we consider the simplest case of an infinite strip ( say in @xmath21 direction ) in @xmath22 , where @xmath23 stands for time .",
    "this formulation closely follows the one given in @xcite for a disc .",
    "here we also describe another way in which we can work on the full plane and encode the boundary structure in the domains of the test functions .",
    "this will serve as a prototype approach we shall use for the finite - dimensional matrix cs model .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the points of @xmath25 .",
    "the strip @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27    the usual action for the abelian chern - simons theory on @xmath26 is @xmath28 the gauge fields satisfy the equal time poisson brackets ( p.b.s ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    from the variation of @xmath32 under @xmath33 we have the gauss law constraint , which can be written by introducing test functions @xmath34 as @xmath35 differentiability of @xmath36 imposes the condition @xmath37 . using ( [ eq : pb1 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : gauss1 ] ) it can be shown that @xmath36 are first class constraints : @xmath38 and generate the gauge transformations @xmath39 .",
    "the charges of this theory are @xmath40 since they are first class : @xmath41 they constitute the observables of this theory .",
    "we note that @xmath42 are test functions associated with @xmath43 s and unlike @xmath34 they in general do not vanish on @xmath44 .",
    "now note that for @xmath45 , @xmath46 this means that test functions which are equal on @xmath44 generate charges which are equal modulo constraints .",
    "thus , @xmath43 are indeed edge observables .",
    "they generate the transformations @xmath47 which do not necessarily vanish on @xmath48 .",
    "the p.b.s of charges can be identified to be the @xmath49 kac - moody algebra on @xmath48 , since @xmath50 choosing the basis for the test functions on @xmath48 as @xmath51 ( [ eq : kac1 ] ) can be written as @xmath52 which is the usual form of the @xmath49 kac - moody algebra .",
    "an equivalent formulation of the above can be given as follows .",
    "consider the cs theory on @xmath22 .",
    "however , now the spatial components of the gauge fields are supported in the region @xmath53",
    "( i.e. in @xmath26 ) , whereas @xmath33 has support in @xmath54 . obviously , ( [ eq : pb1 ] ) holds now only if @xmath55 , otherwise its r.h.s . vanishes .    from the variation of @xmath32 under @xmath33 we still have the gauss law constraint @xmath56 where now the integration is over @xmath25 .",
    "the condition that @xmath34 s are supported in @xmath54 follows from that of @xmath57 which is of course the same as that of @xmath33 .",
    "thus we have @xmath58    the results of the canonical analysis ( given in ( [ eq : can1])-([eq : can3 ] ) ) go through where now integrals are over all @xmath25 and @xmath34 is as given in ( [ eq : can4 ] ) .",
    "this establishes @xmath59 s as first class constraints and @xmath60 as the observables .",
    "clearly , @xmath42 can be supported on all of @xmath25 , but if it is supported only on @xmath61 ( i.e. @xmath62 ) then we immediately see from ( [ eq : cano1 ] ) that @xmath63 .",
    "for @xmath64 we have @xmath65 it follows from this and the remark after ( [ eq : cano1 ] ) that @xmath66 are observables localized at @xmath67 .",
    "the p.b.s of charges gives the kac - moody algebra : @xmath68    a suitable choice for @xmath42 s to compute this algebra at @xmath69 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the step function centered at @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "then we have from ( [ eq : kak ] ) that @xmath74 which is the same as ( [ eq : kac2 ] ) . in order to get the algebra of observables at @xmath75 one",
    "has to replace ( [ eq : kak1 ] ) by @xmath76 this way of treating edge properties is not completely new and has examples in planar systems of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "we now turn our attention to the treatment of the non - commutative case .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite the canonical formulation of chern - simons theory on a non - commutative manifold with boundaries ( such as a disc , an infinite strip etc . ) presents serious difficulties .",
    "in fact the problem underlying such a formulation is that the standard @xmath15-product on the moyal plane is no longer valid on manifolds with boundaries . to make this point clear and supply enough mathematical basis for this assertion let us consider first the chern - simons action on the moyal plane with no boundaries : @xmath77 here @xmath78 , @xmath79 is time @xmath80 and @xmath21 are coordinates on the moyal plane and @xmath81 .",
    "the moyal algebra is characterized by the @xmath15-product @xmath82 defining the @xmath15-commutator of @xmath83 and @xmath84 by @xmath85 the spatial non - commutativity can be expressed as @xmath86 @xmath87 being the non - commutativity parameter .",
    "naively , one may consider @xmath88 on a manifold with boundaries , say the infinite strip @xmath26 , and write the gauss law constraint as @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "however , this expression as well as the @xmath88 when written on the strip @xmath26 is not well defined .",
    "this is because @xmath92 product does not exist on @xmath26 . to prove this fact we note that the formula for the @xmath92 product in ( [ eq : moyal1 ] ) contains the exponential of the differential operator @xmath93 . with the usual definition of its domain @xmath93 generates translations so that @xmath94 translates functions of @xmath80 by @xmath95 : @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath97 has support @xmath98 $ ] , @xmath99 does not , and @xmath92 is not defined on functions supported in @xmath98 $ ] @xcite .",
    "alternatively , to circumvent the impossible task of obtaining a well - defined and useful @xmath15-product on these types of manifolds we propose a finite - dimensional matrix model where the edges are fuzzy .",
    "it becomes the cs theory on a non - commutative infinite strip in the limit where the size of the matrices approaches infinity . in this respect",
    ", we emphasize that our approach is completely different from the previous attempts in the literature as the following section illustrates .",
    "we now describe our matrix model .",
    "since we will be working in the operator formalism in this subsection , we discriminate the operators from the elements of the corresponding moyal @xmath15 algebra of functions by putting a hat symbol on the elements of the former .",
    "thus the moyal plane is described by operators @xmath100 with the relation @xmath101    to supply the mathematical basis for our arguments we think of a simple harmonic oscillator in the @xmath80-direction , described by the hamiltonian @xmath102 and the oscillation frequency @xmath103 .",
    "now consider the hilbert space @xmath104 spanned by the eigenstates of this hamiltonian . in the matrix cs model",
    "we will construct @xmath104 will be associated to the underlying moyal plane , and its finite - dimensional subspaces will serve as the carrier spaces of the operators that we are going to introduce in our matrix model . more precisely , we will define these operators in terms of their action on the elements of a finite - dimensional subspace of @xmath104 and its orthogonal complement .    the number of energy eigenstates of this hamiltonian below the energy @xmath105 with @xmath106 being the maximum classical amplitude ( given by the location of the edges ) is finite and given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the largest integer smaller than @xmath109 .",
    "these @xmath110 states span a subspace @xmath111 of the harmonic oscillator hilbert space @xmath104 and they can be taken as an orthonormal basis in @xmath111 .",
    "is the usual one where states are labeled starting with quantum number @xmath112 , therefore the top state in @xmath111 has the quantum number @xmath113 . ] from ( [ eq : number1 ] ) it is easy to see that keeping both oscillation frequency @xmath114 and the maximum oscillation amplitude @xmath106 fixed while increasing @xmath115 ( i.e. steepening the potential ) results in larger number of states with energy @xmath116 .",
    "hereafter we keep @xmath114 fixed unless otherwise stated .",
    "let us consider a level @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "then the large @xmath119 levels with energy @xmath120 get localized near the edges @xmath121 , since their probability amplitudes are maximum there .",
    "on the contrary , those levels with @xmath122 are localized well inside @xmath123 for large @xmath110 .",
    "we also note that all levels decay exponentially outside @xmath53 .",
    "linear operators on @xmath111 which are zero on the orthogonal complement @xmath124 behave also in a similar fashion .",
    "later we will show that diagonal coherent state matrix elements of operators , say like @xmath125 with @xmath119 will peak near @xmath126 for all @xmath127 for large @xmath110 , while those with @xmath117 much less than @xmath110 acquire maxima within @xmath128 .",
    "the characteristic width of the peaks at @xmath126 , which gets narrower as @xmath110 gets larger , gives us a natural scale to which we will relate the thickness @xmath129 of the `` fuzzy edge '' of our matrix model .",
    "for the finite - dimensional matrix cs theory we have in mind , we treat spatial components of the gauge fields as operators supported on this @xmath110-dimensional subspace @xmath111 of @xmath104 .",
    "this and the physical picture described above for the underlying moyal plane imply two immediate consequences :    * it is those states contained within the thickness @xmath129 of the edges that will be responsible for the edge observables in our finite - dimensional matrix cs model ; * the @xmath130 limit of this matrix cs theory can be taken to define the non - commutative cs theory on the infinite strip with boundaries at @xmath67 .    after writing the matrix cs model and performing the constraint analysis for it",
    ", we will find these observables , and we will have the necessary information to explain and elaborate on the properties of the large @xmath110 limit and how it is realized .",
    "we now split @xmath110 as @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath3 , and use this separation of the total dimension to define the domains and the ranges of our operators . in our formalism the gauge fields @xmath133 are anti - hermitian operators that we choose to take in the way given below : @xmath134 here for any @xmath135,@xmath136 denotes the orthogonal complement of @xmath137 .",
    "the fact that @xmath138 is nonzero only on @xmath139 and not on @xmath140 should be noted .",
    "the reason behind this condition will be explained later in connection with the canonical analysis of the model .",
    "if @xmath141 denotes the @xmath142 normalized energy level and @xmath143 is the operator given by @xmath144 , then we can write , @xmath145 for @xmath138 , the same equation is valid if we replace @xmath146 with @xmath147 .",
    "it also follows from @xmath148 that @xmath149    there is another way to express ( [ eq : gaugef1 ] ) . for this",
    "let us introduce the orthogonal projector @xmath150 by @xmath151    then ( [ eq : gaugef1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath152    the chern - simons lagrangian for the model reads ( up to a total space derivative ) @xmath153 where @xmath154 , trace is over the hilbert space @xmath104 , and derivations are given by @xmath155    several remarks about properties of @xmath156 are in order .",
    "first , @xmath156 changes by total derivatives under infinitesimal gauge transformations of the form @xmath157 where @xmath158 is a matrix with infinitesimal elements .",
    "next , as in chern - simons theory on a commutative manifold , the conjugate momenta @xmath159 to @xmath138 are weakly equal to zero and first class , thus @xmath138 is not an observable and can be eliminated from the rest of our discussion .",
    "the equal time p.b.s of @xmath160 can be written as @xmath161 which in the operator formalism is the statement that @xmath162 and @xmath163 are canonically conjugate . in terms of the operators @xmath164 in ( [ eq : gaugea ] ) , this is @xmath165 we now turn our attention to the canonical constraint analysis of this model .      from the variation of @xmath156 with respect to @xmath166",
    ", we have the gauss law constraint @xmath167 as @xmath168 is not zero only in @xmath139 , we find @xmath169 where @xmath170 is of the same form as @xmath168 : @xmath171 and where we have changed the sign of ( [ eq : g1 ] ) compared to ( [ eq : a0 ] ) for future convenience . in terms of the orthogonal projectors introduced in ( [ eq : orthgp1 ] ) , @xmath172 in the basis spanned by @xmath173 we have",
    "@xmath174 anti - hermiticity requires that @xmath175 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : g1 ] ) is the statement of gauss law in our matrix model and @xmath170 s are non - commutative analogues of the test functions of the commutative cs theory .    `` integrating '' by parts @xmath176 can be written as @xmath177 here the first term is the trace of a `` total derivative '' on a finite - dimensional hilbert space and it vanishes .",
    "note that @xmath178 is identically zero in @xmath179 .",
    "hence , in our matrix model we can write the gauss law as @xmath180    the conditions on @xmath170 translate to those on @xmath181 as @xmath182 or @xmath183    consider now the quantity @xmath184 for an arbitrary operator @xmath185 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath186 for @xmath187 @xmath188 we have @xmath189 also with this substitution the central term in ( [ eq : genexp2 ] ) becomes @xmath190 where we have once more made use of the fact that the trace of a total derivative term vanishes on a finite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "thus for the p.b.s of @xmath191 we find @xmath192 assuring that @xmath176 are first class constraints .",
    "consider now @xmath193 for some @xmath170 fulfilling ( [ eq : l1 ] ) or equivalently ( [ eq : orthglp1 ] ) and @xmath194 such that @xmath195 or @xmath196 in the basis spanned by @xmath197 we have @xmath198 anti - hermiticity gives @xmath199",
    ".    now note that @xmath200 next , from ( [ eq : l1 ] ) and ( [ eq : l3 ] ) we observe that @xmath201 hence , we have @xmath202 which is of the form fulfilling ( [ eq : l1 ] ) .",
    "it now follows at once that the p.b.s of @xmath203 with the gauss law is @xmath204 where the `` central term '' vanishes .",
    "this is because @xmath205 is projected to @xmath140 , and due to antisymmetry of the indices it becomes @xmath206 which is zero on a finite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "in fact one can take the vanishing of the central term as a requirement on @xmath170 s and find out that the maximally large subspace of @xmath104 where @xmath170 is supported and for which ( [ eq : com1 ] ) holds is @xmath139 .",
    "this explains how we arrive at the particular form of the operators for @xmath138 and @xmath170 given in ( [ eq : gaugef1 ] ) and ( [ eq : l1 ] ) respectively .    as a consequence of ( [ eq : chg ] ) ,",
    "@xmath203 s with @xmath207 are first class , and they constitute a set of non - abelian observables of our matrix model .    furthermore , for @xmath208 we have @xmath209 implying that the actions of @xmath210 and @xmath211 on physical states give the same result . finally , we compute the p.b.s of @xmath43 s and find that @xmath212    in order to discuss implication of these results we need one more ingredient , this is contributed by the p.b .",
    "@xmath213 for @xmath214 and for @xmath215 .",
    "thus @xmath216 for @xmath214 and @xmath217 are observables of our matrix theory .",
    "the algebra of these observables is standard and given by ( [ eq : canonical2 ] ) together with the same restrictions on indices @xmath218 and @xmath219 as on @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "it is easy to see that for fixed @xmath4 and @xmath222 there are @xmath223 of these observables .",
    "for instance , for @xmath224 we have @xmath225 as an observable , for @xmath226 , we have @xmath217 , @xmath227 as observables .    from ( [ eq : kac4 ] ) we see that the observables @xmath203 generate a finite - dimensional lie algebra with properties similar to a non - abelian kac - moody algebra .",
    "the differences are that this lie algebra is finite - dimensional and its central charge is modified , due to the appearance of the projectors @xmath228 in the expression .",
    "independently of the value of @xmath222 , @xmath203 is nonzero for nonzero entries of @xmath229 and @xmath230 in a given @xmath231 .",
    "thus we have three unique non - abelian kac - moody - like observables . for fixed @xmath4 and @xmath222",
    "the rest of such non - abelian observables are @xmath232 in number and they can be constructed from the @xmath223 observables @xmath233 given above .",
    "we now investigate the limit @xmath130 .",
    "first we introduce the coherent state @xmath234 by @xmath235 where @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "the diagonal coherent state element of the operator @xmath239 reads @xmath240 where we have included the normalization factor @xmath241 so that @xmath242 . from the definitions",
    "@xmath243 we can deduce the relation between @xmath244 and @xmath245 to be @xmath246 or @xmath247 substituting ( [ eq : z ] ) into ( [ eq : diagonal1 ] ) we define the l.h.s .",
    "of the resulting expression by @xmath248 from eqn .",
    "( 65 ) we see @xmath249 has maxima at the value @xmath250 given by @xmath251 .",
    "this implies that the function @xmath252 has maxima on an ellipse given by @xmath253 the axes of the ellipse being given by @xmath254 and @xmath255 respectively . now holding @xmath87 constant and taking @xmath110 large we see from figure 1 that the maxima of @xmath252 have the geometry of an ellipse which is extended along the @xmath21 direction . for large @xmath110 and fixed @xmath87 and @xmath106 this conclusion",
    "is also seen from the ratio of semimajor axis of the ellipse to its semiminor axis , which is approximately @xmath256 . from this reasoning and from figure 1 and figure 2",
    "we conclude that the extended elliptical geometry in the limit @xmath257 converges to an infinite strip along the @xmath21 axis with peaks at @xmath67 .",
    "this proves our assertion in section 3.2 about the behavior of diagonal coherent state matrix elements of operators on @xmath111 for large @xmath110 .     for @xmath258 and @xmath259.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]     for @xmath258 and @xmath259.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in order to get a measure of the sharpness of the maxima of @xmath260 , we now compute the width of the function @xmath260 at @xmath261 , the computation for @xmath262 being similar .",
    "it may also be noted that although we do the computation at @xmath263 our result is valid for all @xmath264 independent of @xmath110 in the large @xmath110 limit , where the geometry is that of an infinite strip .",
    "let the width of the maxima of the function @xmath260 by denoted by @xmath265 .",
    "we estimate @xmath265 by imposing the requirement that @xmath266 . for large values of @xmath110 ,",
    "the width @xmath265 can be obtained ( using maple ) as @xmath267 thus the width @xmath265 gets narrower as @xmath110 gets larger .",
    "it is however , important to remark the following : the value of the maxima of @xmath260 for large @xmath110 is proportional to @xmath268 .",
    "this implies that for fixed @xmath87 , the height of the peaks decreases as @xmath110 gets larger . nevertheless , the normalization integral @xmath269 is preserved",
    ". a rough estimate of the volume under the graph of @xmath260 would be enough to see that this is the case . for large values of @xmath110 , the width @xmath270",
    ", the height @xmath271 and @xmath21 extends to order @xmath110 .",
    "thus for large values of @xmath110 , the volume under the graph is independent of @xmath110 .",
    "it is natural to take the thickness @xmath129 of the ` fuzzy edge's in our matrix model to be given by the characteristic width @xmath265 of @xmath260 . as @xmath130 we have @xmath272 , and consequently we get sharp boundaries ( i.e. thin edges ) at @xmath126 .",
    "thus this limit defines the non - commutative cs theory on the infinite strip .",
    "we end this section by estimating the spacing between the edge states of our model .",
    "first recall that for a given @xmath273 , the number of edge states in our matrix model is @xmath274 .",
    "let @xmath275 be the spacing of these edge states .",
    "as argued before , the thickness @xmath129 of the `` fuzzy edge '' is given by @xmath265 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath276 however , we note that by construction of our model we have @xmath277 .",
    "this enables us to extract both an upper bound and a lower bound for the spacing of the edge states @xmath275 .",
    "thus in the large @xmath110 limit , using ( 71 ) and ( 72 ) , we find that @xmath278",
    "in this section , we would like to comment on the commutative limit of our matrix model defined by @xmath130 and @xmath279 .",
    "first , we define @xmath280 for an arbitrary operator @xmath281 .",
    "the standard star product is then given by @xmath282 making use of the formula @xmath283 we can express ( [ eq : kac4 ] ) in the diagonal coherent state representation as @xmath284 the first term in r.h.s . of the above expression vanishes as @xmath279 since the @xmath15-product becomes the ordinary product and the commutator of functions @xmath285 under ordinary product is zero .",
    "also in this limit , we see from ( [ eq : orthgp1 ] ) that @xmath286 . using these in ( [ eq : cskac ] )",
    "we recover the standard @xmath49 kac - moody algebra of the edge observables of commutative cs theory : @xmath287 in getting this final result we have made use of the identity @xcite @xmath288 where @xmath289 denotes the moyal representation of the operator @xmath281 , and the fact that the @xmath92 is removed under integration over the moyal plane .",
    "finally it may be noted that the parameter @xmath87 may tend to zero in different fashions resulting to different geometries in the commutative limit .",
    "for example , taking @xmath290 still gives a strip geometry in the large @xmath110 limit . in this case",
    "the height of the maxima of the function @xmath252 at @xmath291 is constant , @xmath21 extends to @xmath292 and @xmath265 varies as @xmath293 . to be more precise for all @xmath294 as @xmath130 results in a strip geometry . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed by lizzi , vitale and zampini in @xcite , the @xmath279 limit keeping the product @xmath295 fixed gives the geometry of a disc .",
    "in this work we have formulated the chern - simons theory on an infinite strip on the moyal plane .",
