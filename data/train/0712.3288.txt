    "it is well  known that then the pressure is determined up to a function depending only on time ( see @xcite ) .    in his pioneering work @xcite",
    "v.  scheffer showed that weak solutions to the 2dimensional euler equations are not unique .",
    "in particular scheffer constructed a nontrivial weak solution which is compactly supported in space and time , thus disproving uniqueness for even when @xmath12 .",
    "a simpler construction was later proposed by a.  shnirelman in @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite , we have shown how the general framework of convex integration @xcite combined with tartar s programme on oscillation phenomena in conservation laws @xcite ( see also @xcite for an overview ) can be applied to . in this way , one can easily recover scheffer s and shnirelman s counterexamples in all dimensions and with bounded velocity and pressure . moreover , the construction yields as a simple corollary the existence of energy ",
    "decreasing solutions , thus recovering another groundbreaking result of shnirelman @xcite , again with the additional features that our examples have bounded velocity and pressures and can be shown to exist in any dimension .",
    "the results so far left open the question of whether one might achieve the uniqueness of weak solutions by imposing a form of the energy inequality .",
    "our primary purpose in this note is to address this issue .",
    "more precisely we prove the following theorem ( for the relevant definitions of weak , strong and local energy inequalities , we refer to sections [ s : weakstrongenergy ] and [ s : localenergy ] ) .",

    "our examples display very wild behavior , such as dissipation of the energy and high  frequency oscillations",
    ". we will refer to them as _ wild solutions_. a natural question is to characterize the set of initial data @xmath4 to which such wild solutions exist , i.e.  the set of initial data for which theorem [ t : main ] holds .",
    "the core of this note is devoted to a first characterization in proposition [ p : main ] of such `` wild '' initial data , in terms of the existence of a suitable subsolution .",
    "an important point is that - in contrast to the constructions in @xcite - for weak solutions satisfying the energy inequality there are nontrivial constraints on @xmath4 . for example",
    "@xmath4 can not be smooth ( see section [ s : dissipative ] ) .",
    "we give a direct construction of wild initial data in section 5 , but for example we were unable to decide the following question : denotes the set of solenoidal vector fields in @xmath13 . ]",
    "@xmath14 a related question is to estimate the maximal dissipation rate possible for wild solutions for a given initial data .    as a byproduct of our analysis we prove a similar non  uniqueness result for the @xmath0system of isentropic gas dynamics in eulerian coordinates , the oldest hyperbolic system of conservation laws .",
    "the unknowns of the system , which consists of @xmath15 equations , are the density @xmath16 and the velocity @xmath17 of the gas : @xmath18\\;=\\ ; 0\\\\ \\rho ( 0 , \\cdot)\\;=\\ ; \\rho^0\\\\ v ( 0 , \\cdot)\\;=\\ ; v^0\\ ,   \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] ( cf .",

    "then , for any given function @xmath0 , there exist bounded initial data @xmath24 with @xmath25 for which there are infinitely many bounded admissible solutions @xmath26 of with @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , all the solutions constructed in our proof of theorem [ t : psistema ] satisfy the energy _",
    "equality_. they are therefore also entropy solutions of the full compressible euler system ( see for instance example ( d ) of section 3.3 of @xcite ) and they show nonuniqueness in this case as well .",
    "this failure of uniqueness was suggsted by elling in @xcite , although the arguments leading him to this suggestion are completely unrelated to our setting .",

    "forming the central part of the paper , we prove proposition [ p : main ] by developing a variant of the `` baire category method '' for differential inclusions which is applicable to evolution equations in the space @xmath28 ( see below ) .",
    "the baire category method has been developed in @xcite , and in @xcite we applied it to .",
    "these techniques do not yield solutions which are weakly continuous in time - a property that is needed in connection with the strong form of the energy inequality .",
    "of course the constructive method is easy to modify to yield such solutions , but baire category techniques have the advantage of showing very clearly the arbitrariness in each step of the construction , by exhibiting infinitely many solutions at the same time .",
    "the main point is to find a functional setup in which the points of continuity of a baire-1 map coincides with solutions of the differential inclusion in the space @xmath28 .    in section 5",
    "we construct initial data meeting the requirements of proposition [ p : main ] , see proposition [ p : initialdata ] .",
    "finally , in section 6 we prove the non  uniqueness theorems [ t : main ] and [ t : psistema ] using proposition [ p : main ] and proposition [ p : initialdata ] .",
    "in this section we discuss various admissibility criteria for weak solutions which have been proposed in the literature .",
    "all the admissibility criteria considered so far in the literature are motivated by approximating with the navier stokes equations .",
    "we therefore consider the following vanishing viscosity approximation of @xmath29 where the parameter @xmath30 is positive but small . the _ weak formulation _ of , which makes sense for any @xmath310,\\infty[)$ ] , is the following : @xmath7 is weakly divergence - free for almost every @xmath8 , and @xmath32 \\,dx\\,dt\\;+\\ ;   \\int_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^n } v^0(x)\\varphi(x , 0)\\ , dx=0\\ ] ] for every test function @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "for smooth solutions , we can multiply and by @xmath17 and derive corresponding partial differential equations for @xmath33 , namely @xmath34 and @xmath35 recall that and model the movements of ideal incompressible fluids .",
    "if we assume that the constant density of the fluid is normalized to @xmath36 , then @xmath37 is the energy density and and are simply the laws of conservation of the energy , in local form . integrating and in time and space and assuming that @xmath0 and @xmath17 are decaying sufficiently fast at infinity , we deduce formally the following identities : @xmath38 @xmath39 let @xmath40 be a divergence  free vector field",
    ". then there exists @xmath41 with @xmath420,\\infty[)$ ] such that @xmath7 is weakly divergence - free and holds for all @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , @xmath43 and more generally @xmath44    in what follows , the solutions of theorem [ t : leray ] will be called _",
    "leray solutions_. as is well known , leray solutions are weakly continuous in time , i.e. @xmath45 is continuous for every @xmath46 . in other words",

    "then , @xmath17 can be redefined on a set of @xmath49 of measure zero so that @xmath47 ; l^2_w ( { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^n))$ ] .",
    "this property ( or a variant of it ) is common to all distributional solutions of evolution equations which can be written as balance laws ( see for instance theorem 4.1.1 in @xcite ) and can be proved by standard arguments . in appendix",
    "a we include , for the reader s convenience , a proof of a slightly more general statement , which will be useful later",

    ", one could formulate a weak local form of the energy inequality , requiring that the natural inequality corresponding to holds in the distributional sense .",
    "this amounts to the condition @xmath70 for any nonnegative @xmath710,\\infty[)$ ] .",
    "note that , since @xmath72 and @xmath73 by the calderon ",
    "zygmund estimates we have @xmath74 .",
    "therefore @xmath75 is a well  defined locally summable function .",
    "it is not known whether the leray solutions satisfy .",
    "however , it is possible to construct global weak solutions satisfying the weak energy inequality and the local energy inequality .",
    "this fact has been proved for the first time by scheffer in @xcite ( see also the appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "the local energy inequality is a fundamental ingredient in the partial regularity theory initiated by scheffer and culminating in the work of caffarelli , kohn and nirenberg , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ t : scheffer10 ] let @xmath76 and let @xmath77 be a divergence  free vector field . then there exists a weak solution @xmath17 of with @xmath78 and which satisfies , and .    by analogy , for weak solutions of , duchon and robert in @xcite have proposed to look at a local form of the energy inequality .",
    "[ d : dr ] consider an @xmath79 weak solution @xmath17 of .",
    "we say that @xmath17 satisfies the _ local energy inequality _ if @xmath80 in the sense of distributions , i.e. if @xmath81 for every nonnegative @xmath710,\\infty[)$ ] .",
    "similarly , if the equality in holds for every test function , then we say that @xmath17 satisfies the _ local energy equality_.    since holds even for weak solutions of , @xmath72 implies @xmath74 , and hence the product @xmath82 is well  defined .",
    "note , however , that , for solutions of euler , the requirement @xmath72 is not at all natural , even in low dimensions : there is no apriori estimate yielding this property .",
    "two other very weak notions of solutions to incompressible euler have been proposed in the literature : diperna  majda s measure  valued solutions ( see @xcite ) and lions dissipative solutions ( see chapter 4.4 of @xcite ) .",
    "both notions are based on considering weakly convergent sequences of leray solutions of navier - stokes with vanishing viscosity .    on the one hand , the possible oscillations in the nonlinear term @xmath83 lead to the appearance of an additional term in the limit , where this term is subject to a certain pointwise convexity constraint .",
    "this can be formulated by saying that the weak limit is the barycenter of a measure  valued solution ( cf .",
    "@xcite and also @xcite for alternative settings using wigner- and h - measures ) .",
    "a closely related object is our `` subsolution '' , defined in section [ ss : functional ] .",
    "on the other hand , apart from the energy inequality , a version of the gronwall inequality prevails in the weak limit , leading to the definition of dissipative solutions , cf .",
    "appendix b. as a consequence , dissipative solutions coincide with classical solutions as long as the latter exist :    [ t : lions ] if there exists a solution @xmath84 ; l^2 ( \\rn{n}))$ ] of such that @xmath85 ; l^\\infty ( \\rn{n}))$ ] , then any dissipative solution of is equal to @xmath17 on @xmath86 $ ] .",

    "our construction yields initial data for which the nonuniqueness results of theorem [ t : main ] hold on any time interval @xmath87 .",
    "however , for sufficiently regular initial data , classical results give the local existence of smooth solutions .",
    "therefore , proposition [ p : wimpdissbis ] implies that , _ a fortiori _ , the initial data considered in our examples have necessarily a certain degree of irregularity .",
