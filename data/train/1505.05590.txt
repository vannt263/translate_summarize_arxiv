    "a delaunay triangulation for a set @xmath3 of points in @xmath4 is a triangulation such that no point in @xmath3 is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in the triangulation .",
    "it is well known that delaunay triangulations tend to avoid skinny triangles , since they maximize the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the triangulation .",
    "although the delaunay triangulations in euclidean spaces are well understood  @xcite , the _ intrinsic _ delaunay triangulations on riemannian manifolds have received less attention . by using the closed ball property  @xcite , dyer et al .",
    "@xcite proposed adaptive sampling criteria for constructing intrinsic voronoi diagram and its dual delaunay triangulation on 2-manifolds .",
    "recently , boissonnat et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an algorithm for constructing intrinsic delaunay triangulation on smooth closed submanifold of euclidean space .",
    "both methods are based on the _ convex neighborhood _ , which , in general , is an extremely small region around a point on the surface . as a result , in spite of their important theoretical values , they are not practical for piecewise linear surfaces , which are dominant in digital geometry processing .    rivin  @xcite and indermitte et al .",
    "@xcite defined intrinsic delaunay triangulation ( idt ) on triangle meshes , where the idt edges are geodesic paths and the _ geodesic _ circumcircles of all delaunay triangles have empty interiors .",
    "the intrinsic delaunay triangulation has many nice properties .",
    "for example , bobenko and springborn  @xcite proved that the classic cotangent laplace - beltrami operator ( lbo ) has non - negative weights @xmath5 , if and only if the underlying triangulation is delaunay .",
    "they also proposed a new lbo which depends only on the intrinsic geometry of the surface and its edge weights are non - negative .    using intrinsic properties , such as the strong convexity radius and the injectivity radius , dyer et al .",
    "@xcite presented adaptive sampling criteria which guarantee the idt is regular .",
    "their elegant results establish inequalities that relate these intrinsic properties to the local feature size .",
    "however , to our knowledge , there is no practical algorithm for computing strongly convex regions on meshes . to date , the only practical algorithm for computing idt is the edge - flipping algorithm  @xcite , which iteratively flips the non - locally delaunay edge to be locally delaunay .",
    "the edge - flipping algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement .",
    "indermitte et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the edge flipping algorithm terminates in a finite number of steps and thus the intrinsic delaunay tessellation exists .",
    "bobenko and springborn  @xcite proved the uniqueness of the intrinsic delaunay tessellation .",
    "although the edge flipping algorithm converges , it has no known time complexity .",
    "moreover , the resultant idt may contain _ non - regular _ triangles , which have either self - loops ( i.e. , edges with identical end points ) or faces with only two edges .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new method for constructing intrinsic delaunay triangulation on 2-manifold triangle meshes .",
    "our idea is to compute a geodesic voronoi diagram ( gvd ) , which has a regular dual triangulation . given a 2-manifold mesh with @xmath1 vertices , our method first computes the gvd by taking all vertices as sites .",
    "then , our method identifies the voronoi cells that violate the closed ball property  @xcite and fixes them by adding auxiliary sites .",
    "we show that by adding at most @xmath2 sites , the dual graph of the geodesic voronoi diagram is an intrinsic delaunay triangulation , which is guaranteed to be _",
    "regular_. moreover , thanks to the bounded time complexity of computing geodesic voronoi diagrams  @xcite , our method has a theoretical worst - case time complexity @xmath0 .",
    "we observe that most real - world models are far from their delaunay triangulations , thus , the edge - flipping algorithm takes many iterations to converge , whereas our method is not sensitive to the number of non - delaunay edges and it _ empirically _ runs in linear time @xmath2 on these models .    as a by - product ,",
    "the regular delaunay triangulations naturally induce discrete laplace - beltrami operators ( lbos ) , which are intrinsic to the geometry and have non - negative weights .",
    "we evaluate the commonly used discrete lbos on the original triangulations and the intrinsic delaunay triangulations .",
    "computational results show that the idt induced lbos are more accurate than the lbos defined on the original mesh . moreover , their discrete laplacian matrices have smaller condition number than the original triangulations . as a result ,",
    "idts are ideal for applications which solve the linear system and eigensystem of the discrete laplacian .",
    "we demonstrate the idts on harmonic mapping and manifold harmonics , and observe that the idts produce more accurate and robust results than the original triangulations .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : preliminaries ] reviews the mathematical background and highlights the fundamental difference between the 2d delaunay triangulation and the idt on meshes .",
    "section  [ sec : idt ] details our algorithm for computing idts , followed by the experimental results and comparison in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "section  [ sec : lbo ] shows the idt induced discrete lbos are more accurate and robust than the original meshes , and demonstrates them on solving the linear system and eigensystem of the discrete laplacian .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper . to ease reading",
    ", we list the main notations in table  [ table : notation ] and delay the long proofs in appendix .",
    ".main notations .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      as mentioned above , the idt induced cotangent lbo is intrinsic to the geometry and non - negative for all edges .",
    "these features are highly desirable to many graphics applications , such as denoising  @xcite , parameterization  @xcite , quadrangulation  @xcite , manifold harmonics  @xcite , shape signature  @xcite , diffusion distance  @xcite and biharmonic distance  @xcite , just name a few . in this subsection , we demonstrate idt on harmonic mapping and manifold harmonics , two typical applications based on the discrete lbo . the conformal discrete laplacian matrix @xmath6  @xcite is @xmath7 where @xmath5 is the cotangent weight for edge @xmath8 ( see equation  ( [ eqn : cotan ] ) ) .",
    "let @xmath9 be a diagonal matrix , where @xmath10 is the voronoi area at vertex @xmath11 .",
    "then the discrete laplacian matrix @xmath12  @xcite is given by @xmath13    the harmonic mapping is to solve a linear system of @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath14 be a scalar function defined on mesh vertices . since @xmath15 , we need to fix at least one vertex to get a unique solution . without loss of generality ,",
    "say @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath17 is harmonic if @xmath18 for all vertices @xmath11 , @xmath19 . the discrete harmonic map @xmath17",
    "is realized by solving the linear system @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and matrix @xmath23 coincides with the discrete laplacian matrix @xmath24 except for the first row , which is @xmath25 .",
    "we compute the condition number of @xmath23 , which is a good measure of the numerical stability of the linear system . as table  [",
    "table : runningtime ] shows , the idt induced matrix @xmath23 has smaller condition number than the matrix produced by the original mesh .",
    "we use harmonic mapping to parameterize the fandisk model , which is a genus-0 model with 1 boundary ( i.e. , a topological disk ) .",
    "the boundary vertices are mapped to unit circle @xmath26 using arc - length parameterization ( see figure  [ fig : fandisk](b ) ) .",
    "we evaluate the parameterization quality by measuring the angle distortion @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the side lengths and angles of triangle @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the parameterized 2d triangle of @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the triangle area . to visualize @xmath17 on the idt using texture mapping , we tessellate each non - planar geodesic triangle to planar polygons and linearly interpolate the texture coordinates for points at which the geodesic edges and the mesh edges meet . as figure",
