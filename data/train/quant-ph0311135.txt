    "the electromagnetic field describing a laser pulse is intrinsically quantum mechanical and may become entangled with an atom when the two systems interact .",
    "the consequences of this fact for experiments which employ lasers as control fields has been the topic of several recent papers @xcite .",
    "all agree that these quantum effects are negligible compared to errors induced by spontaneous emission out of the beam .",
    "in particular , in our previous work @xcite , we calculated the rate at which information is gained about a two - level atom when one measures a near resonance laser pulse that has interacted with it",
    ". this measurement strength could be interpreted as the rate at which photons are spontaneously emitted into the modes defined by the laser beam  a small fraction of the total emission rate . indeed ,",
    "as commented by itano @xcite , the quantum fluctuations in a laser beam are equivalent to those in the vacuum , and thus using the standard unitary mollow transformation @xcite , all quantum effects related to the atom - laser interaction in free space are derived from spontaneous emission in the transformed frame .",
    "though not an important source of error in quantum operations , entanglement is nonetheless generated between the atom and the laser beam .",
    "photons spontaneously emitted into the laser modes change the quantum statistics of those modes in a way that is correlated with the state of the atom .",
    "this entanglement might prove useful as a resource in some quantum communication or quantum computation scheme@xcite .",
    "moreover , by determing how much entanglement one can generate in free space , we obtain a benchmark for comparison with other entanglement generation schemes .",
    "for example , the entanglement generated in a cavity qed geometry @xcite could be compared to the entanglement that would be generated in the absence of the resonator .    quantifying the entanglement generated between an atom and a laser in free space",
    "is complicated by the _ multimode _ nature of the field in a traveling wave geometry .",
    "the hilbert space describing the laser modes is the tensor product of many independent subsystems .",
    "additionally , the laser and atom do not form a closed system , as the other vacuum modes of the field interact with the atom .",
    "since spontaneous emission into these unoccupied modes dominates over quantum features within the laser modes , it is generally inconsistent to neglect their effects when calculating atom - laser entanglement .    to analyze this problem",
    ", we use the formalism developed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "we review the salient features in the next section .",
    "we then proceed to examine the entanglement generated between the laser pulse mode and the atom .",
    "this result is compared to similar results obtained using a closed - system single mode picture .",
    "we follow this with a calculation of an upper bound on the total entanglement generated between the atom and all modes propagating with the laser beam .",
    "a brief summary of results is presented in the concluding section .",
    "in many problems it is useful to have a local description of the quantized field . for example , when the field interacts with a well localized atom or when an experiment uses a detector to continuously measure the field , a delocalized plane wave description is awkward . in systems where a physical quantization volume is defined , such as in cavity qed @xcite , a local set of quantized modes is naturally defined .",
    "however , in free space no such intrinsic volume is present . a quantization procedure which considers local temporal modes rather than delocalized spatial modes",
    "@xcite has a limited regime of validity . instead , through an appropriate coarse - graining of the standard modal decomposition",
    ", we can achieve the desired local picture @xcite .",
    "a brief review of the pertinent points follows .",
    "the procedure begins by separating the field modes into paraxial and nonparaxial modes . in the canonical example",
    "a laser beam impinges upon an atom , interacts with it , then illuminates a detector .",
    "this optical system defines a set of modes traveling essentially in one direction with a small diffraction angle .",
    "we quantize these paraxial modes by associating a fock space to every member of a coarse - grained set of wave packets of width @xmath0 and transverse area @xmath1 .",
    "these form an approximate complete set for the paraxial subspace if the dynamics on a time scale smaller than @xmath2 are negligible .",
    "the coarse - graining length is arbitrarily chosen for convenience and generally should not appear in any experimentally relevant result .",
    "it may be chosen to be the width of a trapped atom or to correspond to the detector bandwidth @xmath3 , using @xmath4 .",
    "this latter definition is natural when considering the entanglement resource than can be detected .",
    "we introduce coarse - grained spatially localized mode functions @xmath5 and an associated set of annihilation operators @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the paraxial field and atom in the interaction picture and under the rotating wave approximation is , @xmath7 here @xmath8 are window functions selecting out the mode currently interacting with the atom @xmath9 in this picture , each wave packet mode propagates past the atom , interacts with it according to a jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xcite , then flies away .",
    "these dynamics are intrinsically irreversible , in contrast to a cavity qed scenario in which excitaitons oscillate between the field and atom reversibly @xcite .",
    "the information contained in these modes can act to decohere the atom at a rate @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total spontaneous emission rate and @xmath12 is the effective scattering cross section on resonance .",
    "the  measurement strength \" , @xmath13 , represents the rate at which photons are spontaneously emitted into the paraxial modes .    the nonparaxial modes which constitute the rest of the field are quantized using the standard free space quantization procedure , associating a fock space to every plane wave .",
    "in the following , these modes will be treated as a zero temperature reservoir into which the atom can decay .",
    "the only difference from standard spontaneous emission will be that the rate of decay is slightly reduced by the removal of the paraxial modes .",
    "@xmath14 with @xmath15 the solid angle subtended by the paraxial beam . including the nonparaxial modes ,",
    "the full master equation for the atom - paraxial field system becomes @xmath16           -\\frac{\\gamma'}{2 } \\left\\ { \\hat \\sigma _",
    "+ \\hat \\sigma _ -,\\hat{\\rho }   \\right\\ }      + \\gamma ' \\,\\hat \\sigma _ - \\hat{\\rho } \\hat \\sigma _ + , \\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the hamiltonian that couples the paraxial field modes to the atom , given in eq .",
    "( [ e : hamiltonian ] ) .    in our canonical example the paraxial modes are taken to be in an initial coherent state , corresponding to the quantum state of a laser beam .",
    "we perform a mollow transformation @xcite on the above master equation to remove the initial coherent field amplitude of the laser and transfer it into the hamiltonian . in the `` mollow picture '' , the initial state of the field is the vacuum and the master equation becomes @xmath18           -\\frac{\\gamma'}{2 } \\left\\ { \\hat \\sigma _",
    "+ \\hat \\sigma _ -,\\hat{\\rho }   \\right\\ }      + \\gamma ' \\,\\hat \\sigma _ - \\hat{\\rho } \\hat \\sigma _ + , \\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the coherent semi - classical rabi - flopping hamiltonian @xmath20 the mollow transformation is achieved by a local unitary operator acting on the field alone and so will not affect the atom - field entanglement .",
    "equation ( [ e : master ] ) thus serves as our of basic dynamical description for entanglement calculations .",
    "in reviewing the paraxial formalism in the last section we made a distinction between the paraxial and nonparaxial field modes , the paraxial modes being those modes which travel past the atom and impinge upon the detector .",
    "we then traced out the nonparaxial modes to recover the master equation ( [ e : master ] ) .",
    "the remaining paraxial subsystem is still a very large dimensional hilbert space , composed of a tensor product of fock spaces for each coarse - grained wavepacket in the pulse .",
    "such a large hilbert space has many subsystem decompositions , any one of which could be of interest when calculating entanglement ( fig .",
    "[ f : diagram2 ] ) . in this section",
    "we consider two possible decompositions : ( i ) entanglement between the atom and the mode defined by the laser pulse , ( ii ) entanglement between the atom and the entire paraxial subsystem .",
    "the former is natural to consider when treating the laser pulse as a single mode , analogous to a jaynes - cummings cavity qed geometery @xcite .",
    "the latter is of interest when relating the atom - laser entanglement to the measurement strength of the laser and to the error in quantum logic induced by a control pulse .",
    "in addition , when calculated using this second division , we can find an upper bound on the atom - laser entanglement that can be used as resource for quantum information processing .    to quantify entanglement",
    ", we use a monotone known as the  tangle \" which can be related to the square of the more familiar concurrence and also to the entanglement of formation @xcite . for overall pure states where at least one of the systems has only two levels ( is a qubit ) the tangle is equal to the normalized linear entropy ( or purity ) of the marginal state of either subsystem @xcite , @xmath21 ^ 2 \\right ] \\right).\\ ] ] this formula can be generalized to mixed states by taking the convex roof @xcite @xmath22 we choose to use the tangle instead of the full von neumman entropy due to its ease of calculation .",
    "we consider first the tangle between the atom an the  symmetric \" paraxial mode ( fig .",
    "[ f : diagram2 ] ) , defined by the annihilation operator , @xmath23 this mode defines a laser pulse of duration @xmath24 . in calculating the tangle in this decomposition all of the other field modes , nonparaxial and nonsymmetric paraxial modes ,",
    "act as a reservoir which , when traced over , lead to a mixed - state description of our bipartite system .",
    "we assume @xmath25 , implying that the probability for the atom to emit a photon into one of the paraxial modes is very small . in the mollow picture ( used throughout ) the hilbert space of the quantum field",
    "may thus be truncated , allowing at most one excitation in the paraxial subsystem .",
    "note that the atom is still allowed to spontaneously emit an arbitrary number of photons into the nonparaxial field modes . under these assumptions",
    "the atom and the symmetric field mode both behave as two - level systems , coupled together in an overall mixed state .",
    "the tangle for such two - level systems can be calculated using wootters general formula for two qubits @xcite .",
    "we begin by calculating the atom - symmetric mode density matrix from eq .",
    "( [ e : master ] ) for @xmath26 . in principle",
    ", one could solve for the state of the entire atomic - paraxial system , and then trace out the nonsymmetric modes .",
    "however , even limiting all paraxial modes to at most one total excitation there are still @xmath27 possible field states , @xmath28 being the number of coarse - grained modes",
    ". a more sensible approach is to keep only the  dynamic symmetric mode \" at any instant ( as defined below ) , tracing out any non - symmetric modes along the way .",
    "consider first a single time step @xmath29 , with @xmath0 the coarse - graining length . at the start of this interval",
    "the system hilbert space has dimension @xmath30 .",
    "the system consists of the two - level atom and a quantized symmetric mode of the field composed _ only _ of those coarse - grained modes which have already passed the atom , and restricted to one possible excitation . assuming @xmath31 modes have passed ,",
    "the annihilation operator for this symmetric field mode will be @xmath32 after evolution over a time interval @xmath33 , we choose a new subsystem division so that we again have a @xmath34 system .",
    "the second subsystem will now correspond to the symmetric mode over the @xmath35 coarse - grained modes that have now passed the atom .",
    "the procedure may then be repeated to build up the full evolution , and the tangle can be calculated at each step .",
    "the procedure for evolving the state from time @xmath36 to @xmath37 is as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath38 time intervals have passed .",
    "the density operator @xmath39 will be spanned by the basis states @xmath40 during the next interval a new coarse - grained mode impinges upon the atom .",
    "this mode starts in the vacuum ( in the mollow picture ) so the new state for this composite system is @xmath41 through the next time interval this state evolves under a combination of the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian which couples the atom to the quantized mode , a semi - classical coherent atom - laser interaction , and spontaneous emission into the nonparaxial modes .",
    "we model this by a short time integration of the master equation , eq .  ( [ e : master ] ) . during this time",
    "the density matrix must be expanded to include the newly interacting mode .",
    "the basis states include the previous set , eq .",
    "( [ e : startbasis ] ) , tensored with @xmath42 for the newly added mode , plus the two new states @xmath43 states of the form @xmath44 are higher order terms that are ignored under the assumption that @xmath25 .",
    "this gives a total of six basis states for the density operator .",
    "after performing the evolution over this time interval we trace out the nonsymmetric modes of the extended paraxial subsytem . to do this",
    ", we perform a unitary transformation on the field operators to create a new tensor product decomposition . instead of the decomposition described in eqs .",

    ".    the mixed state entanglement between the atom and the symmetric field mode can be calculated using wootters formula for the tangle @xcite directly from this density matrix .",
    "the results will depend on several physical parameters : the area of the beam , the intensity of the laser @xmath51 , and the duration of the pulse .",
    "additionally , the numerical accuracy will depend upon the length of the time step used in the calculations , or equivalently the number of time steps @xmath28 . to maintain the paraxial approximation",
    ", we choose the area of the beam to be @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds roughly to the quadrupole transition @xmath53 to @xmath54 in @xmath55 considered by van enk and kimble @xcite , for which a laser focused to a spot size of 100 @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath57 . for simplicity",
    "we consider only @xmath58 pulses , such that @xmath59 . with the relations @xmath60 and @xmath61 , assuming a fixed @xmath28 , we have a direct relationship between @xmath62 and @xmath24 . we choose as our free parameter the emission probability , @xmath63 , which sets the degree of entanglement between the atom and laser .    a plot of the tangle versus @xmath63 is given in fig .",
    "[ f : symmetrictangle ] .",
    "each point in the plot corresponds to the total tangle measured just after the @xmath58 pulse has completely passed the atom .",
    "for very short pulses , the growth in the tangle is linear with @xmath63 for all initial conditions , leading to a unit slope on the log - log plot .",
    "however the constant of proportionality is different .",
    "this difference can be attributed to the probability of the atom being in the excited state during the pulse interval  the more excitation the higher the rate of growth . with a greater probability of spontaneous emission , the behavior deviates strongly from this linear trend , peaking roughly where the pulse length and decoherence time are comparable . after this time the entanglement drops precipitously , and for at least one initial condition , the atom and symmetric field mode become separable .",
    "the maximum emission parameter shown in the plot is @xmath64 , which corresponds to @xmath65 ; for a larger emission probability , our truncation of the field hilbert space to one excitation breaks down .",
    "the calculation in sec .",
    "[ s : symcalc ] yields the entanglement between the atom and the laser mode as it propagates past the atom .",
    "it is a complex procedure because we have explicitly separated the two sources of decoherence : spontaneous emission into the nonparaxial modes and spontaneous emission into the paraxial but nonsymmetric modes .",
    "we did this because spontaneous emission into the symmetric - paraxial mode is the source of the entanglement and we must be careful not neglect this important effect .",
    "nonetheless , emission into the nonsymmetric - paraxial modes is a small fraction of the total loss since @xmath66 .",
    "we can consistently maintain the coherent coupling between the atom and the symmetric mode while neglecting emission into the nonsymmetric mode since it acts only as a small source a decoherence , a process dominated by off - axis emission .",
    "we thus lump all sources of decoherence together , with total rate @xmath67 . in this case",

    "a more radical simplification is to ignore the decoherence term in eq .",

    "one is _ not _ in the strong coupling regime in free space and so agreement between the entanglement calculated using closed and open system models should not be expected apriori .",

    "this agreement holds even when the system is not in the strong coupling regime , @xmath78 .    to understand why the entanglement calculated using closed and open system dynamics agree",

    "the total loss of entanglement is thus proportional to @xmath83 for @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the tangle generated in the closed system dynamics between @xmath1 and @xmath81 . since entanglement will be generated in the closed system at a rate proportional to the coupling @xmath13 , the total loss of entanglement is of order @xmath86 .",
    "alternatively , a nondeterministic jump in a quantum trajectory can reduce entanglement if it leads to a particular statistical mixture of states as described below .",

    "the amount of entanglement that can be destroyed through this process will then be of order @xmath86 .",

    "this is sufficiently small to ensure that the closed system dynamics generates the same entanglement as the open system dynamics when @xmath77 and @xmath25 , independent of the relation between them , i.e. even when the strong coupling approximation breaks down .",

    "after the pulse has passed may be represented by a density operator of the form @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the state evolved under the closed system unitary dynamics , while @xmath92 represents the state conditioned on a jump having occurred during the interaction time .",

    "we find a suitable solution by truncating the recursion at @xmath148 steps corresponding to at most @xmath35 jumps into the nonparaxial modes .",
    "solving for @xmath127 , using this truncated solution , we can then obtain an upper bound on the tangle according to eq .",
    "( [ e : jumptangle ] ) .    our upper bound on the tangle",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : fulltangle ] as a function of time . for short times ,",
    "linear behavior is exhibited , as in the previous calculations for the symmetric tangle .",
    "note , however , that the rate of entanglement generation is always greater than the symmetric calculation . for short pulse durations @xmath149 there is only a @xmath150 difference in rates for the initial condition @xmath151 , the state that is most excited during the interval .",
    "all of the plotted upper bounds turn over at roughly the same point , slightly past where the pulse duration equals the decoherence time , and then converge on a single limit for large decoherence probability .",
    "this behavior is an artifact our calculation  for long times all information about the initial state has been lost since all trajectories with appreciable probability have undergone multiple jumps .",
    "entanglement is generated between a laser beam and an atom in free space due to the atom s spontaneous emission of photons into the paraxial modes , superimposed on the laser s coherent field amplitude . through the use of judicius approximations ,",
    "we were able to quantify this entanglement , a fundamentally hard problem for a large dimensional open quantum system .",
    "in particular we calculated the entanglement between the atom and the field mode defined by the laser pulse .",
    "of particular interest is how our measure of a entanglement is reproduced under further simplifying assumptions .",
    "we considered two models : a lumped decoherence model and a closed - system model . in the former",
    "all sources of decoherence , paraxial and nonparaxial , are lumped into a single decoherence term .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the full calculation when the paraxial approximation holds , @xmath152 .",
    "this is as expected , since the vast majority of the decoherence is due to the nonparaxial modes .",
    "more surprisingly , a closed system model which treats the quantized atom laser - pulse dynamics via a single mode jaynes - cummings hamiltonian is in excellent agreement when @xmath77 , even when the strong coupling assumption was violated .",
    "this result was unexpected since the naive picture would argue that , in the absence of the strong atom - mode coupling , @xmath103 , spontaneous emission into other modes should destroy entanglement .",
    "we have shown , however , that the particular form of the coupling between the vacuum modes and the atom - laser system in fact _ preserves _ the entanglement .",
    "thus , there is no contradiction between the observation that all quantum effects in the atom - laser interaction are due to spontaneous emission @xcite and the fact that atom - laser entanglement can be accurately modeled using a single mode jaynes - cummings dynamic @xcite when @xmath77 .",
    "such agreement is ensured by the fact that spontaneous emission is the _ only _ decoherence mechanism .",
    "finally , we placed an upper bound on the total entanglement that is generated between the atom and the full set of paraxial field modes .",
    "we used the quantum trajectory method to calculate a dynamical unravelling of the master equation , which provides a natural ensemble decomposition of the bipartite density matrix . averaging the pure state tangle over this ensemble leads to an easily calculated upper bound .",
    "it remains to be seen how tight this bound is .",
    "nonetheless , it provides a useful benchmark on the total entanglement resource that is available for quantum information processing applications .",
