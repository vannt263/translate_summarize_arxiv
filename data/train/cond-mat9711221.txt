    "in anisotropic superconductors , local rotations of the lattice modulate the order parameter .",
    "the most striking manifestation of this effect is the influence of grain boundaries in high - t@xmath2 superconductors@xcite .",
    "less pronounced effects are also to be expected from lattice defects such as dislocations , as they twist the lattice axes in their vicinity .",
    "transversely polarized phonons can , in principle , also couple to the superconducting order parameter through the local rotations that they induce .",
    "if , along a given direction , there are strains which change the orientation of the lattice axes , the equilibrium order parameter must follow that distortion .",
    "for instance , in a two dimensional square lattice , a parameter with @xmath3 symmetry , @xmath4 , must change into @xmath5 after a lattice rotation by an angle @xmath6 .",
    "we express the local order parameter in terms of its components in a fixed frame of reference which is independent of the orientation of the lattice .",
    "we expand the local order parameter in terms of the functions @xmath7 , defined in this external frame . in principle",
    ", the symmetry of the square lattice allows for mixing of a pure @xmath8 function with higher spherical harmonics . under a rotation ,",
    "each of these harmonics behaves differently , and requires a specific description in the external frame of reference mentioned earlier . for simplicity",
    ", we will first ignore these higher order components .",
    "their inclusion will be discussed later , as well as extensions to more complex order parameters .",
    "we will now set up an effective ginzburg landau description of the situation described above .",
    "let us first consider a model superconductor with very small coherence length . at each position",
    ", the order parameter will match perfectly the orientation of the lattice axes .",
    "there is no cost in free energy due to misorientations in the order parameter .",
    "we can ignore gradient terms , and use an expression which contains only quartic and quadratic terms , provided that we insert in them the value of order parameter with respect to the local axes .",
    "the coupling between neighboring regions is described by gradient terms .",
    "there is a free energy cost associated to the inhomegeneities of the order parameter . in the present case",
    ", the degree of inhomegeneity must be referred to the fixed , external frame of reference .",
    "there is an increase in the free energy of the system when different areas of the lattice are misoriented , even if the local order parameter is aligned with the respective axes .",
    "a particular example of this situation is a grain boundary , as described in the introduction .",
    "the difference between the two ways of describing the order parameter , with respect to an external frame or to the local one , is determined by the degree of rotation of the lattice from one region to another .",
    "let us define the rotation which takes the axes from one point to another by the angle @xmath6 . as mentioned previously ,",
    "an order parameter which follows the lattice will look , in the external frame , like @xmath4 in one point and @xmath9 in the other .",
    "the transformation which takes one expression into the other can be accomplished by modifying the two component vector @xmath7 by means of an operator of the type @xmath10 , such that : @xmath11 and : @xmath12 the integral is to be taken along the path in real space along which the lattice is rotated .",
    "as @xmath6 is the total rotation along the path considered , we can write , for the example considered here : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gradient operator in real space , @xmath15 specifies the local rotation of the lattice axes , and @xmath16 is a pauli matrix .",
    "the rotation @xmath15 can be written as@xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the local deviations of the lattice node at @xmath19 from equilibrium .",
    "( [ rotation ] ) is valid for small deviations ( strains ) .",
    "the expressions above allow us to relate the changes in the order parameter as seen in the two frames , and the rotations of the lattice , in terms of the local strains . the gradient term in the ginzburg landau description , which should be expressed with respect to the external frame , looks , in terms of the order parameter with respect to the local axes : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the free energy .",
    "@xmath22 is a number with dimensions of temperature , and of order @xmath23 .",
    "finally , @xmath24 are proportionality constants which play no role in the analysis presented below .",
    "we take the critical temperatures of the @xmath25 order parameters as different , as appropiate for a square lattice .",
    "equation ( [ gl ] ) and the definitions ( [ gauge ] ) and ( [ rotation ] ) suffice to study the phenomenology of layered superconductors whose order parameter is well approximated by @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that , when @xmath4 and @xmath27 have the same critical temperature , and @xmath28 , the effects of the field can be made to vanish by performing a local rotation of the order parameter@xcite . in this case , the system has isotropic superconducting properties .",
    "hence , rotations of the underlying crystal lattice leave the ( degenerate ) order parameter unaffected .",
    "the formalism described here can be expressed in terms of a connexion , which depends on the lattice orientation .",
    "the definition of parallel transport of a vector , in our case @xmath29 , needs to be modified by the rotation of the lattice .",
    "the usual derivative is changed into a covariant derivative@xcite .",
    "this technique lies at the basis of the extensive work done in topological phases@xcite , and has found use in many fields in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "in addition to the effects described by ( [ gl ] ) , there may be an explicit coupling of the order parameter to the lattice strains .",
    "the simplest coupling is proportional to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 defines the local compression , or expansion , in terms of the symmetric part of the strain tensor .",
    "this term can also exist in a @xmath32 wave superonductor .",
    "a coupling of this type is not negligible in the high - t@xmath2 compounds , due to the strong dependence of t@xmath2 on pressure@xcite .",
    "the previous analysis can be generalized to three dimensional superconductors with arbitrary order parameters .",
    "local rotations of the lattice can be expressed in terms of the parameter : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fully antisymmetric tensor . in order to determine the transformations induced by these rotations in the order parameter",
    ", we must first decompose it into spherical harmonics with well defined transformation properties .",
    "then , a gauge field which performs rotations in order parameter space is added to each component . finally , as in ( [ gl ] ) , all terms allowed by the lattice symmetry are included in the free energy .",
    "the procedure is cumbersome , but straightforward .",
    "for instance , we can add to ( [ gl ] ) higher harmonics which transform like @xmath35 , \\sin [ ( 4 n + 2 ) \\theta ] $ ] .",
    "the gauge field associated to these components is of the type @xmath36 , where @xmath37 transforms one of these parameters into the other .",
    "the gauge field induced by the higher harmonics of the order parameter are also proportional to the gradient of the lattice rotations , but with a larger constant of proportionality .",
    "the term with @xmath38 in the free energy induces a reduction of these components of the order parameter .",
    "this reduction will be stronger for higher harmonics than for lower ones .",
    "we now consider specific lattice distortions within the layers .",
    "the simplest static defect is a dislocation .",
    "the strains in the vicinity of a dislocation can be calculated from the theory of elasticity . if the burgers vector is @xmath39 , then@xcite , @xmath40 where we are neglecting a possible anisotropy in the elastic constants of the lattice .",
    "we now assume that the @xmath27 component is negligible , which is justified if , for instance , the parameter @xmath41 in ( [ gauge ] ) is less than zero .",
    "then , the coupling of the lattice rotations to @xmath4 is due to terms quadratic in the gauge potential , and we obtain : @xmath42 and latexmath:[$| { \\bf \\vec{a } } |^2 = \\frac {     term is to reduce the effective critical temperature near the dislocation .",
    "it suppresses a possible local enhancement of t@xmath2 due to the explicit dependence of the critical temperature on pressure@xcite . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", the normal cores of vortices will be attracted towards the dislocations , to take adventage of the supression of t@xmath2 , leading to pinning .",
    "near the core of the dislocation , @xmath44 , we can estimate the reduction of t@xmath2 ( see below ) as @xmath45 .",
    "this effect can be significant in a material with a short coherence length , such as the copper oxides .",
    "a grain boundary can be modelled as an array of dislocations .",
    "the gauge fields induced by each of them can be added , to obtain the effect of the whole boundary . after some algebra , we find that , if the rotation of the axes across the boundary is not large : @xmath46 ^ 2 + \\sin^2 \\left ( \\frac{\\pi y}{\\bar{a } } \\right)}{\\left [ \\cosh \\left ( \\frac{\\pi x}{\\bar{a } } \\right ) - \\cos \\left ( \\frac{\\pi y}{\\bar{a } } \\right ) \\right]^4 } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sim & \\frac{\\pi^2 \\sin^4 ( \\theta ) } { 4 a^2 } e^{- \\frac { \\pi x}{\\bar{a } } } , \\ , \\ , \\ , \\ , \\ , x \\rightarrow \\infty \\label{grainb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the lattice constant , @xmath6 is the angle between the axes at both sides of the boundary , and @xmath48 . from ( [ grainb ] ) and ( [ gl ] ) , we can estimate the reduction of the critical temperature at the boundary .",
    "we assume that @xmath24 , and @xmath49 .",
    "then , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "this calculation is rigorously valid when @xmath52 , that is , when strains change slowly .",
    "a significant reduction of t@xmath2 can be expected near a twin boundary , which will act in a way similar to a weak link .",
    "it would be interesting to check this experimentally@xcite .",
    "the orientation of the lattice can also be modified dynamically , by transversely polarized phonons .",
    "a longitudinal phonon induces local compressions and dilatations of the lattice .",
    "a transverse phonon does not change the volume of the unit cell , but induces a shear deformation which changes from position to position .",
    "this deformation can be viewed as a local rotation of the axes . in a material with a complex unit cell , there are also optical phonons which rotate locally the axes",
    ". the rotations can be analyzed by means of the formalism discussed before .",
    "the only difference with a static distortion is that the gauge field which accounts for the lattice rotations depends on dynamic displacements .",
    "the time scales associated to the superconducting response are of the order of the inverse plasma frequency .",
    "this frequency is much higher than typical phonon frequencies , so that the changes in t@xmath53 induced by phonons can be studied as if the lattice distortions were static .",
    "transversely polarized acoustic phonons give rise to strains proportional to the gradient of their amplitudes .",
    "hence , we expect that the fourier components of @xmath15 are given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the amplitude of a phonon of momentum @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the component of @xmath56 perpendicular to @xmath55 . for transversely polarized phonons , @xmath56 is always perpendicular to @xmath55 , and we do not need to take this restriction into account .",
    "the gauge potential in ( [ gauge ] ) has a finite average , related to the thermal ( or quantum ) average value of the phonon amplitudes .",
    "it is given by : @xmath58    we are analyzing materials which show strong differences in the superconducting properties along the in plane and out of plane directions .",
    "phonons , however , need not be so anisotropic .",
    "we assume that they are described by an isotropic sound velocity , @xmath59 , and a debye frequency @xmath60 , where @xmath47 is the lattice constant , which we take to be of the same order of magnitude in all directions . the three dimensional integral implicit in ( [ gaugeph ] )",
    "is extended to those modes such that @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "note that the ginzburg - landau description used here is valid at length scales greater than @xmath64@xcite . for simplicity , we take the bose occupancy of a mode of frequency @xmath65 to be @xmath66",
    ". none of these approximations will alter the order of magnitude of the effect .",
    "we can distinguish three regimes : i ) if @xmath67 , the upper cutoff in ( [ gaugeph ] ) is due to the bose factor .",
    "ii ) when @xmath68 , the upper cutoff is @xmath69 and @xmath70 and iii ) if @xmath71 , the maximum value of @xmath72 is @xmath73 .",
    "we can now estimate the reduction in the ( average ) value of the critical temperature in the same way as in the previous section .",
    "we find : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the density .",
    "this reduction of the critical temperature should not be negligible in the high - t@xmath2 compounds , as @xmath64 is not very different from @xmath47 , the lattice constant .",
    "in addition to a reduction in the average value of t@xmath2 , we can also analyze the fluctuations in this value .",
    "we are treating phonons as a source of static disorder , which reduces t@xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath76 fluctuates , changing the local values of the critical temperature .",
    "if these fluctuations take place on scales larger than @xmath64 , a distribution of t@xmath2 s will be observed . as the changes in t@xmath2 go as : @xmath77 we find that : @xmath78 and : @xmath79 by comparing ( [ tcphonons ] ) and this expression",
    ", one can see that fluctuations can not be neglected . finally , the typical length scale for fluctuations inside the planes is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the electronic bandwidth .",
    "hence , we expect large fluctuations in small scale domains .",
    "transport measurements will be unable to resolve this structure , and the average @xmath82 will be observed .",
    "transverse optical phonons of frequency @xmath83 .",
    "give an additional reduction of t@xmath2 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the mean square displacement of the phonon .",
    "it is , typically , a fraction , @xmath86 of @xmath87 . as in the previous case , we assume that the superconducting order parameter has a short coherence length in the out of plane direction . there is a contribution like ( [ phononopt ] ) for each optical phonon transversely polarized in the plane .",
    "the frustration of the order parameter in anisotropic superconductors by dynamical vibrations implies that @xmath88 can not be much larger than the frequency of the phonons responsible of the effect .",
    "the ginzburg landau expression ( [ gl ] ) contains terms which are linear in @xmath76 , which couple one component of the order parameter and the spatial derivatives of the other ( note that @xmath76 is an operator which rotates one component into the other ) .",
    "these derivatives are different from zero in the presence of a supercurrent , because of the variation in the phase . in the case described by ( [ gl ] ) , however , these terms do not contribute , as @xmath89 .",
    "terms of this type play a role in materials where the superconducting properties differ significantly along the lattice axes .",
    "let us consider an orthorhombic superconductor , where the order parameter is @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to the terms in ( [ gl ] ) we also have : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the @xmath32 component of the order parameter . for the sake of simplicity , we ignore terms induced by the orthorhombic symmetry which are quadratic in the gradients@xcite .",
    "these terms , needed for a complete description of the anisotropy in the penetration depth , do not modify qualitatively the picture discussed in the previous sections .    in the absence of internal lattice rotations , @xmath92 .",
    "the first term in ( [ ortho ] ) leads to a difference in the penetration depth along the two lattice axes .",
    "local rotations of the lattice can be incorporated by adding the gauge field ( [ gauge ] ) to the derivatives of the @xmath0 components of the order parameter in ( [ ortho ] ) .",
    "then , assuming that the equilibrium order parameter has both @xmath4 and @xmath91 components , we obtain terms of the type : @xmath93 this expression gives a contribution if @xmath94 , and , in particular , in the presence of a current .",
    "the changes in a current carrying state induced by lattice rotations are best studied within london s framework , which is valid if the magnitude of the order parameter does not change .",
    "we define the london tensor , with the same symmetry properties of the perfect lattice , such that @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the electromagnetic vector potential . for the study of currents within the layers",
    ", we have : @xmath97 where @xmath98 are the penetration depths along the two axes , and @xmath59 is the velocity of light .",
    "london s expression for the free energy is@xcite : @xmath99 the deviation of tetragonal symmetry is given by @xmath100 .",
    "taking into account that the gauge field related to the lattice distortions , @xmath101 , is itself a derivative , we can integrate by parts in eq.([orthoder ] ) , to obtain : @xmath102 this equation can be interpreted as a rotation of the london tensor , ( [ londont ] ) , induced by the distortion of the lattice .",
    "the currents adjust to the directions of the local principal axes . at a grain boundary ,",
    "for instance , @xmath96 must be continuous .",
    "the component of the current parallel to the boundary must be discontinous , leading to a kink in the direction of the total current , as the london tensor which gives the current at both sides is discontinuous@xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , the boundary conditions prevent the current from acquiring a transverse component , the vector potential shows a kink , and a perpendicular magnetic field is generated at the boundary , as sketched in fig([twin]@xcite .",
    "this picture , derived from london s theory , is valid at distances comparable to the penetration depth .",
    "the discontinuity at the boundary is rounded off at shorter scales .",
    "the present analysis implies that currents can also be deflected by other types of static defects , and by phonons .",
    "the currents flowing near a dislocation , and the instantaneous current in the presence of phonons , are sketched in fig.([currents ] ) .",
    "magnetic fields will be induced .",
    "it is interesting to note that phonons can modulate the currents and give rise to electromagnetic fields .",
    "so far , we have only considered the role of in plane distortions in layered superconductors .",
    "if we include rotations around in plane axes , we must allow for components like @xmath103 in the order parameter . because of the strong anisotropy of these compounds , components which transform like higher powers of @xmath104 are also to be expected . in analogy with ( [ london ] ) , these components lead to contributions of the type @xmath105 , where the direction @xmath106 lies in the planes .",
    "note that this effect should also be present in layered superconductors with @xmath32 symmetry within the layers .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath107 coupling is proportional to @xmath108 .    a particular defect which generates rotations in the out of the plane direction is a screw dislocation , which seems to be common in sputtered films@xcite . in cylindrical coordinates",
    ", we have that only @xmath109 is different from zero@xcite .",
    "hence , the free energy of the superconductor has a term like @xmath110 .",
    "a current flowing around the dislocation induces a current parallel to the axis of the dislocation .",
    "this situation may arise if a vortex is pinned by a screw dislocation .",
    "a similar effect can be realized in a monocrystalline whisker subject to shear strains .",
    "then , @xmath111 , leading again to a @xmath110 coupling .",
    "a current flowing along the axis of the whisker induces a tangential component , giving rise to a magnetic field in its interior .",
    "a schematic picture of both situations is sketched in fig.([dislocation ] ) .",
    "we have presented a formalism to study the influence of lattice rotations on anisotropic superconductors .",
    "the analysis has been particularized to d - wave layered systems , but it is general enough to be applicable to more complex lattices and order parameters .",
    "we expect the scheme outlined here to be also useful for the study of heavy fermions and other materials which show an anisotropic order parameter .    for the systems considered here , we find that    \\i ) lattice distortions couple directly to an anisotropic order parameter , irrespective of other mechanisms , like the dependence of t@xmath2 on pressure .",
    "\\ii ) higher harmonics of the order parameter are more strongly frustrated by local rotations@xcite .",
    "\\iii ) lattice defects , such as dislocations , reduce locally t@xmath53 . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the vortex cores will be attracted to these regions , giving rise to pinning .",
    "\\iv ) transversely polarized phonons also reduce t@xmath2 .",
    "the value of the critical temperature can not be much larger than the typical frequency of these phonons .",
    "\\v ) local rotations deflect supercurrents in superconductors with inequivalent lattice axes .",
    "in particular , the current through a grain boundary is deflected .",
