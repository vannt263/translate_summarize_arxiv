    "the elucidation of dynamo action is a problem of central importance in nonlinear dynamics because it has implications for a variety of physical systems",
    ". dynamo instabilities , which amplify weak magnetic fields in a turbulent conducting fluid , are believed to be the principal mechanism for the generation of magnetic fields in celestial bodies and in the interstellar medium  @xcite , and in liquid - metal systems  @xcite studied in laboratories . in these situations",
    "the kinematic viscosity @xmath3 and the magnetic diffusivity @xmath4 can differ by several orders of magnitude , so the magnetic prandtl number @xmath5 can either be very small or very large ; e.g. , @xmath6 at the base of the sun s convection zone , @xmath7 in the liquid - sodium system , and @xmath8 in the interstellar medium .",
    "this prandtl number is related to the reynolds number @xmath9 and the magnetic reynolds number @xmath10 that characterize the conducting fluid ; here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are typical length and velocity scales in the flow ; clearly @xmath13 .",
    "two dissipative scales play an important role here ; they are the kolmogorov scale @xmath14 [ @xmath15 at the level of kolmogorov 1941 ( k41 ) phenomenology  @xcite ] and the magnetic - resistive scale @xmath16 [ @xmath17 in k41 ] . for large prandtl numbers ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath18 , @xmath19 so the magnetic field grows predominantly in the dissipation range of the fluid till it is strong enough to affect the dynamics of the fluid through the lorentz force .",
    "this behavior is a characteristic of a small - scale turbulent dynamo , in which dynamo action is driven by a smooth , dissipative - scale velocity field . in the initial stage of growth ,",
    "called the kinematic stage of the dynamo , the magnetic field is not large enough to act back on the velocity field .",
    "dynamo action can be obtained for values of @xmath1 that are large enough to overcome joule dissipation ; and the dynamo - threshold value @xmath20 decreases as @xmath0 increases  @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 in liquid - metal flows  @xcite so they lie in the small - prandtl - number region , @xmath22 , for which the growth of the magnetic energy occurs initially in the _ inertial scales _ of fluid turbulence , because @xmath23 ; here the velocity field is not smooth and the local strain rate is not uniform : at the k41 level the turnover velocity of an eddy of size @xmath24 is @xmath25 , so the rate of shearing @xmath26 .",
    "direct numerical simulations ( dns ) are playing an increasingly important role in developing an understanding of such dynamo action .",
    "most dns studies of mhd turbulence  @xcite have been restricted , because of computational constraints , either to low resolutions or to the case @xmath27 ; small - scale dynamos , with @xmath28 have also been studied via dns  @xcite .",
    "however , given the large range spanned by @xmath0 in the physical settings mentioned above , some recent dns studies of the mhd equations have started to explore the @xmath0 dependence of dynamo action ; the range of @xmath29 covered by such pure dns studies  @xcite is quite modest ( @xmath30 ) . to explore the dynamo boundary in the @xmath2 plane over a large range of @xmath0 ,",
    "one recent study  @xcite has used a combination of numerical methods , some of which require small - scale models like large - eddy simulations ( les ) or lagrangian - averaged mhd ( lamhd ) , and others , like a pseudospectral dns , in which the only approximations are the finite number of collocation points and the finite step used in time marching ; yet another dns study  @xcite has introduced hyperviscosity of order @xmath31 to study the low @xmath0 regime ; by using this combination of methods these studies has been able to cover the range @xmath32 and to obtain the boundary between dynamo and no - dynamo regions but with fairly large error bars .",
    "we have carried out extensive , high - resolution , numerical studies that have been designed to explore in detail the boundary between the dynamo and no - dynamo regimes in the @xmath2 plane in a shell model for three - dimensional mhd  @xcite .",
    "this shell model allows us to explore a much larger range of @xmath0 than is possible if we use the mhd equations .",
    "although our study uses a simple shell model , it has the virtue that it can explore the boundary between dynamo and no - dynamo regions in great detail without resorting to the modelling of small spatial scales .",
    "shell - model studies of dynamo action have also been attempted in refs .",
    "@xcite but these have concentrated on aspects of the dynamo problem that are different from those we consider here .",
    "our study suggests that it is natural to think of the boundary between dynamo and no - dynamo regimes in the @xmath2 plane as a first - order phase boundary that is the locus of first - order , nonequilibrium phase transitions from one nonequilibrium statistical steady state ( ness ) to another .",
    "the first ness is a turbulent , but statistically steady , conducting fluid in which the magnetic energy is negligibly small compared to the kinetic energy ; the second ness is also a statistically steady turbulent state but one in which the magnetic energy is comparable to the kinetic energy . indeed , the ratio of the magnetic and fluid energies @xmath33 turns out to be a convenient order parameter for this nonequilibrium phase transition since it vanishes in the no - dynamo phase and assumes a finite , nonzero value in the dynamo state .",
    "the other , intriguing result of our study is that the boundary between these phases is very intricate and might well have a fractal character ; this provides an appealing explanation for the large error bars in earlier attempts to determine this boundary  @xcite .",
    "the analogy with first - order transitions that we have outlined above is not superficial . as in any first - order transition",
    "we find that our order parameter shows hysteretic behavior  @xcite as we scan through the dynamo boundary by changing the forcing term at a nonzero rate .",
    "we also find some evidence of nucleation - type phenomena : the closer we are to the dynamo boundary , the longer it takes for a significant magnetic field to nucleate and thus lead to dynamo action .",
    "we compare our results with earlier studies such as ref .",
    "@xcite , which have suggested that dynamo action occurs because of a subcritical bifurcation .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ models ] we describe the shell model for mhd  @xcite and the numerical method we employ . sec .",
    "[ results ] is devoted to our results and sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] contains a concluding discussion .",
    "to study dynamo action it is natural to use the equations of magnetohydrodynamics(mhd ) . in three dimensions",
    "the mhd equations are @xmath34 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the kinematic viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity , respectively , the effective pressure @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the pressure . for low - mach - number flows ,",
    "to which we restrict ourselves , we use the incompressibility condition @xmath37 ; and @xmath38 .",
    "as we have mentioned above , a dns of the mhd equations poses a significant computational challenge , even on the most powerful computers available today , if we want to cover a large part of the @xmath2 plane and to locate the dynamo boundary accurately .",
    "therefore one study  @xcite has used a combination of les , lamhd , and dns to obtain this boundary .",
    "we employ a complementary strategy : we use a simple shell model for mhd  @xcite that allows us to carry out very extensive numerical simulations to probe the nature of the dynamo boundary without using les or lamhd .",
    "shell models comprise a set of ordinary differential equations with nonlinear coupling terms that mimic the advection terms in and respect the shell - model analogs of the conservation laws of the parent hydrodynamic equations in the inviscid , unforced limit  @xcite . for the case of mhd",
    "each shell @xmath39 is characterized by a complex velocity @xmath40 and a complex magnetic field @xmath41 in a logarithmically discretized fourier space with wave vectors @xmath42 ; furthermore , there is a direct coupling only between velocities and magnetic fields in nearest and next - nearest neighbor shells .",

    "the parameters @xmath52 , are obtained by demanding that these equations conserve all the shell - model analogs of the invariants of 3dmhd , in the inviscid , unforced case , and reduce to the well - known gledzer - ohkitani - yamada ( goy ) shell model  @xcite for fluid turbulence if @xmath53 , @xmath54 . in particular , to ensure the conservation of shell - model analogs of the total energy @xmath55 , cross helicity @xmath56 , and magnetic helicity @xmath57 , in the unforced and inviscid case , and to obtain the goy - model limit for the fluid , we choose @xmath58 the only adjustable parameters are the forcing terms and @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "we use the following boundary conditions : @xmath65 we set @xmath66 and use a fifth - order , adams - bashforth scheme for solving the shell - model equations , i.e. , for an equation of the type @xmath67 we use @xmath68,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the time step .",
    "we have found that this numerical scheme works well for the integration of eqs.([shell1 ] ) and ( [ shell2 ] ) so long as @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in all our calculations we use @xmath72 .",
    "characteristic time scales include the time scale for diffusion @xmath73 and the large - eddy - turnover time @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the box - size length scale and @xmath76 is the root - mean - square velocity .",
    "the initial conditions we use are as follows : we first obtain a statistically steady state for the goy - shell - model equations , which are obtained from eq.([shell1 ] ) by setting all @xmath77 ; the forcing terms are chosen to be @xmath78 , with @xmath79 in all our runs , except ones in which we study hysteretic behavior , and @xmath51 .",

    "the curves with black squares indicate @xmath110 from the initial steady state for the goy shell model ; and the black lines with no symbols show the k41 @xmath111 spectrum for comparison . from this line",
    "we see that the ness that is obtained , once dynamo action has occurred , is such that both velocity and magnetic - field energy spectra display a substantial inertial range with k41 scaling ; these inertial ranges are not large enough , at least near the dynamo boundary in our runs , for a reliable estimation of multiscaling corrections to the @xmath112 exponent .",
    "if @xmath113 then the scaling ranges in velocity and magnetic - field spectra are comparable ; as @xmath0 decreases ( increases ) , the scaling range for the magnetic spectrum decreases ( increases ) relative to its counterpart in the velocity spectrum ; these trends are clearly visible in the representative plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we return now to the identification of the dynamo boundary . a close scrutiny of the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] shows that the initial growth of @xmath94 is not monotonic .",

    "can , therefore , map out the dynamo boundary in the @xmath119 plane .",
    "the crossing time @xmath117 depends on @xmath0 and @xmath120 .",

    "in other words the dynamo boundary depends on @xmath122 ; we have checked this explicitly in several cases .",
    "an important questions arises now : is there a well - defined dynamo boundary in the @xmath2 plane as @xmath123 ?",
    "earlier studies  @xcite have began to answer this question .",
    "they find that , if @xmath124 , then a well - defined dynamo boundary is obtained .",
    "however , since they work with the mhd equations the error bars on this boundary are large and the range of values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 rather limited .",
    "the simplicity of our model allows us to carry out a systematic study of the dynamo boundary .",
    "we find that , at least in our shell model for mhd , we can obtain an asymptotic dynamo boundary ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stability ] ) if we choose @xmath125 , i.e. , we conclude that dynamo action has occurred if @xmath118 exceeds @xmath126 ; furthermore , if @xmath118 falls below @xmath127 we say that dynamo action will never be achieved .",
    "we continue the temporal evolution of eqs.([shell1 ] ) and ( [ shell2 ] ) till one of these criteria is satisfied . for all values of @xmath0 and @xmath120 that we have used",
    "we find that this @xmath122 , the run time required to decide whether or not dynamo action occurs , is several orders of magnitude lower than @xmath89 .",
    "we have also checked for several representative pairs of values for @xmath0 and @xmath1 that runs of length @xmath124 do not change our conclusions about such dynamo action .    the dynamo boundary that we obtain is shown in the stability diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] .",
    "red circles indicate parameter values at which we obtain dynamo action whereas green stars are used for values at which no dynamo occurs .",
    "the most important result that follows from this stability diagram is that the boundary between dynamo and no - dynamo regimes is very complicated .",
    "it seems to be of fractal - type , with an intricate pattern of fine , dynamo regions interleaved with no - dynamo regimes .",
    "this is especially apparent in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] , which shows a detailed view of the stability diagram in the vicinity of the dynamo boundary .",
    "earlier studies seem to have missed this fractal - type of boundary because they have not been able to examine the transition in as much detail as we have for our shell model .",
    "however , fractal - type boundaries between different dynamical regimes have been suggested in other extended dynamical systems ; recent examples include the transition to turbulence in pipe flow  @xcite and different forms of spiral - wave dynamics in mathematical models for cardiac tissue  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] we have drawn two black , dashed lines ; the region above the upper one of these lines is predominantly in the dynamo regime ; the area below the lower one of these lines is predominantly in the no - dynamo regime .",
    "these two lines give an approximate indication of the error bars we might expect in the determination of the dynamo boundary in a study that can not scan through points in the @xmath128 plane as finely as we have .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : tseries ] we see that the order parameter @xmath33 jumps from a very small value in the no dynamo region to a value @xmath129 in the dynamo state .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to think of the dynamo boundary as a nonequilibrium , first - order boundary . in an equilibrium ,",
    "first - order transition the order parameter shows hysteretic behavior if we scan through a first - order boundary by , say , changing , at a finite rate , the field that is conjugate to the order parameter  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask if we see such hysteretic behavior at the dynamo boundary .",
    "indeed , we do , as we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : hysterisis ] where we cross the dynamo boundary by changing the amplitude @xmath130 of the forcing term in eq.([shell1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hysterisis ] shows representative plots of the dynamo order parameter @xmath33 versus @xmath130 ; these illustrate the hysteretic behavior that occurs when @xmath130 is cycled at a finite , nonzero rate across the dynamo boundary ; here @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "as @xmath130 increases , @xmath33 follows the blue , full line : it increases and then saturates ; fluctuations are superimposed on these mean trends .",

    "[ fig : time ] .",
    "however , it is hard to fit a precise form to the behavior of @xmath117 near the dynamo boundary partly because of the complicated nature of this boundary which makes it difficult to estimate the position @xmath20 reliably ( the plot in fig .  [",

    "( 27 ) in ref .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of dynamo action in a shell model of turbulence  @xcite .",
    "our study has been designed to explore the nature of the boundary between dynamo and no - dynamo regimes in the @xmath119 plane over a much wider range of @xmath0 than has been attempted in earlier numerical studies .",
    "the dynamo boundary emerges as a first - order nonequilibrium phase boundary between one turbulent , nonequilibrium statistical steady state ( ness ) and another  @xcite .",
    "this point of view is implicit in earlier work , e.g. , in studies of the kazantsev dynamo  @xcite or in studies that view dynamo generation as a subcritical bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "one of these studies  @xcite has remarked that when dynamo action  ... is obtained in a fully turbulent system , where fluctuations are of the same order of magnitude as the mean flow ... the traditional concept of amplitude equation may be ill - defined and one may have to generalize the notion of  subcritical transition `` for turbulent flows ... '' .",
    "we believe that the natural generalization is the nonequilibrium , first - order transition we suggest above .",
    "we have explored the explicit consequences of such a view in far greater detail than has been attempted hitherto . in particular , the ratio @xmath33 is a convenient order parameter for this nonequilibrium phase transition ; it shows hysteresis across the dynamo boundary like order parameters at any first - order transition ; and nucleation - type phenomena also seem to be associated with dynamo formation .",
    "last , and perhaps most interesting , we find that the dynamo boundary seems to have a fractal character ; this provides a natural explanation for the large error bars in earlier attempts to determine this boundary  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this fractal - type boundary might well be the root cause of magnetic - field reversals discussed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to check , of course , that our shell - model results carry over to the mhd equations .",
    "this requires large - scale dns that might well be beyond present - day computing capabilities if we want to explore issues like the possible fractal nature of the dynamo boundary .",
    "however , analogs of the hysteretic behavior we mention above have been obtained in dns studies of the mhd equations  @xcite ; hysteresis has also been seen in a numerical simulation that includes turbulent convection  @xcite . in some of these studies",
    "hysteretic behavior is obtained by changing the viscosity of the magnetic prandtl number .",
    "we have obtained hysteresis by changing the forcing ; this change of forcing might be easier to effect in experiments than a change of the viscosity or magnetic diffusivity .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "earlier studies have not noted the increase in the dynamo - formation time @xmath117 as the dynamo boundary is approached from the dynamo side . we have suggested that this is akin to the increase in the time required to form a critical nucleus as we approach a first - order boundary  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see if such an increase of @xmath117 can be obtained in dns studies of dynamo formation with the mhd equations .",
    "it is worth noting here that some dns studies  @xcite have suggested that simulation times comparable to the diffusion time scale @xmath89 are required to confirm dynamo formation ; by contrast our shell - model study yields dynamo action on a much shorter time @xmath117 , which increases as we approach the dynamo boundary . perhaps the large simulation times required for dynamo action in full mhd simulation might have arisen because these simulations have been carried out in the vicinity of the dynamo boundary .    to settle completely whether the dynamo boundary is of fractal - type , very long simulations might be required to make sure that the apparent fractal nature is not an artifact of long - lived metastable states",
    "to make sure that our calculations do not suffer from such an artifact , we have carried out very long runs for representative points in the region of the dynamo boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] ; we have found that these long runs do not change our results .",
    "furthermore , it is useful to check whether , instead of one dynamo boundary , there is a sequence of transitions , with more and more complicated temporal behaviors for the order parameter , as has been seen in the turbulence - induced melting of a nonequilibrium vortex crystal  @xcite .",
    "we have not found any conclusive evidence for this but , in the vicinity of the dynamo boundary , the order parameter can oscillate for fairly long times ( see , e.g. , the green full curve in fig .  [ fig : tseries ] ) . to decide conclusively whether these oscillations characterize a new nonequilibrium oscillating state , different from the simple dynamo and no - dynamo nesss we have mentioned , requires extensive numerical studies that lie beyond the scope of this paper .    in equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics different ensembles are equivalent ; in particular , we may determine a first - order phase boundary by using either the canonical or the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "however , such an equivalence of ensembles does not apply to transitions between different nonequilibrium statistical steady states ( nesss ) ; examples may be found in driven diffusive systems  @xcite or in the turbulence - induced melting of a nonequilibrium vortex crystal  @xcite .",
    "given that the dynamo boundary separates two turbulent nesss , we might expect that this boundary might depend on precisely how the system is forced .",
    "evidence for this exists already : for example , the dynamo boundary depends on whether a stochastic external force is used  @xcite or whether a taylor - green force is used  @xcite ; furthermore , this boundary is different if the fluid is helical  @xcite , as in most astrophysical dynamos .",
