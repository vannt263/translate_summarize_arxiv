    "in particular , the ch2 ( 4.5 @xmath11 m ) band can be used as a control band since it does not contain any known pah line features .",

    "figures  [ fig2u][fig6u ] suggest that the ionized region is dominant inside the bubble while the pah , molecular gas , and cold dust emission are absent , as is expected , while the warm dust emission at 24 @xmath11 m is detected in the hii region , as mentioned before . combining the multi - wavelength characteristics of cn 148",
