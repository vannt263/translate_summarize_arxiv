    "ngc 253 is a nearby , barred sc galaxy with a nuclear starburst region ( @xmath7 ; telesco & harper 1980 ) . the galaxy has been extensively studied at different wavelengths .",
    "the proximity of the galaxy ( d@xmath8 3.4 mpc ) and the ongoing nuclear starburst makes it an ideal candidate to study enhanced star formation at nearby distances .",
    "the galaxy is nearly edge on ( @xmath9 ) with a considerable amount of dust in the center which makes it bright in the infrared wave bands .",
    "observations of the h@xmath1 emission line indicate possible nuclear outflows and stellar winds in the central region , arising from enhanced star formation ( ulrich 1978 , schulz & wegner 1992 ) .",
    "radio continuum observations reveal numerous compact sources within the inner 200 pc which are either supernova remnants or hii regions ( ulvestad & antonucci , 1997 ) . at near - infrared wavelengths ( nir )",
    ", a prominent bar can be observed in the center ( scoville et al .",
    "1985 ) whose position angle is tilted by about 18with respect to the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "interferometric co observations with a resolution of @xmath10 have shown the presence of a molecular bar of dimensions @xmath11 , whose orientation is similar to the nir bar ( canzian , mundy & scoville , 1988 ) .",
    "hcn and cs emissions , which trace dense gas , also reveal a similar bar ( paglione et al 1995 and peng et al .",
    "recent work on the bar of ngc 253 indicate that there is at least one inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) point for the galaxy ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "various types of data on ngc 253 indicate that the nuclear starburst is mainly located within a circumnuclear ring in the bar ( e.g. engelbracht et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the kinematics of gas in the nuclear region of 253 has been known to be anamolous from the early observations by demoulin & burbidge ( 1970 ) .",
    "radial velocity measurements at various position angles near the nucleus show that , in addition to solid body rotation , large non - circular motions exist within the central region ( ulrich 1978 , shulz & wigner 1992 , munoz - tunon , vilchez & castaneda 1993 ) .",
    "however , due to problems of obscuration at optical wavelengths , results from and [ nii ] observations are difficult to interpret . longer wavelength observations such as that of co ( canzian , mundy & scoville 1988 ) , br@xmath12 ( puxley and brand 1995 ) and h@xmath13 ( prada et al .",
    "1996 ) indicate steeper velocity gradients along the major axis and only solid body rotation in the central region .",
    "most of the optical and ir observations , aimed at studying the kinematics of the nuclear region of 253 ( e.g. arnaboldi et al .",
    "1995 , prada et al .",
    "1996 , prada , gutierrez & mckeith 1998 , engelbracht et al .",
    "1998 ) , have relied on measuring the velocity gradients along chosen position angles passing though the nucleus ( e.g. major axis and minor axis ) .",
    "however interferometric radio observations at millimeter and centimeter wavelength ( e.g. canzian et al .",
    "1988 , paglione et al .",
    "1995 , anantharamaiah & goss 1996 , peng et al .",
    "1996 ) measure two - dimensional velocity fields which provide a more complete picture of the kinematics in the nuclear region .",
    "these two - dimensional measurements reveal a complex but systematic velocity pattern in the central region .",
    "in addition to solid body rotation , the observed velocity fields indicate motions which may be due to a bar - like potential in the center ( peng et al 1996 ) or a kinematic sub - system which may be caused by a past merger event ( anantharamaiah & goss 1996 ) .",
    "the highest resolution measurement of the two - dimensional velocity field available to date is that of anantharamiah & goss ( 1996 ) who observed the h92@xmath1 recombination line with a beam of @xmath14 and a velocity resolution of 54 .",
    "the line emission is detected in the central @xmath15 ( approximately 150 pc@xmath1660 pc ) region of 253 and oriented roughly along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the observed velocity field of the h92@xmath1 line emission shown in figure 1a , has an elongated s - shaped pattern with iso - velocity contours running almost parallel to the major - axis of the galaxy . for pure solid body rotation ,",
    "the iso - velocity contours are expected to run parallel to the minor - axis .",
    "showed that this velocity field could be fitted to a set of three orthogonally rotating nested rings of ionized gas .",
    "such an interpretation is however only empirical and has no clear physical basis .",
    "the central velocity field of 253 has been observed over a larger scale ( @xmath17 ) but with coarser angular resolution ( @xmath18 ) in molecular lines ; co ( canzian et al .",
    "1988 ) , hcn ( paglione et al . 1995 ) and cs ( peng et al 1996 ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier the molecular line emission is oriented along the nir bar which is tilted by 18with respect to the major axis whereas the h92@xmath1 line emission is mainly along the major axis .",
    "the velocity field of the molecular gas is also distinctly different from that of the ionized gas .",
    "peng et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have suggested that the morphology and kinematics of the dense molecular gas can be explained by gas moving in a bar potential .    in this paper , we have attempted to model the inner velocity field of ngc 253 to determine whether the velocity pattern observed by can also be explained by motion of gas in a bar potential .",
    "we also present in this paper , new observations of the velocity field in the co line with an angular resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "since gas is a collisional system ( unlike stars which can be collisionless ) , it tends to settle on closed , non - intersecting orbits in the bar potential . using a bar model , we have detemined a set of closed orbits from which a velocity field is derived and compared with observation in the h92@xmath1 and the co lines . while the bar model succesfully accounts for the velocity field observed in the h92@xmath1 line in the inner ( @xmath20 ) region , it does not account of the observed co velocities on a larger scale ( @xmath21 )",
    "the only earlier attempt to model the nuclear velocity field of ngc  253 using a bar model is that of peng et al ( 1996 ) who attempted to explain the velocity field observed on the larger scale in the cs line .",
    "although , peng et al ( 1996 ) have reported success of their model , by comparing observed position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams with pv plots of closed x1 and x2 orbits , we show in this paper that a single bar model can not explain both the h92@xmath1 and the co ( or the cs ) velocity fields .",
    "in figure 1b , we show a new measurement of the velocity field of @xmath22co obtained using the owens valley radio interferometer . the angular resolution is @xmath23 .",
    "these observations were made as a part of a detailed study of molecular gas in the nuclear region of ngc 253 , which will be published elsewhere ( yun et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "a comparision of figs 1a and 1b shows that there are several differences in the velocity fields observed in the h92@xmath1 and the co lines .",
    "while the co emission occurs over a much larger region ( @xmath24 ) , the h92@xmath1 line is confined to the inner most region ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the position angles of the two emission regions are different : while the h92@xmath1 line emission is along the major axis of the galaxy ( pa = 52 ) , the co emission is oriented along the axis of the nir bar ( pa = 70 ) .",
    "the iso - velocity contours in figures 1a and 1b run along entirely different position angles .",
    "some distortion in the co velocity field is seen at the position where the h92@xmath1 emission is observed .",
    "it is possible that , at higher angular resolution , the co velocity field may resemble the h92@xmath1 velocity field in the central region .",
    "the iso - velocity contours in figure 1b also do not run parallel to the minor axis of the galaxy indicating that the kinematics of the co gas is not dominated by standard galactic rotation . the velocity field observed by peng et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the cs line is similar , but less systematic compared to the co velocity field in figure 1b .",
    "gas clouds dissipate energy through collisions . hence such clouds will tend to move along closed orbits in a plane . in a bar potential , there are two types of closed orbits in the plane of the galaxy ; the 1 ( bar ) orbits which are extended along the major axis of the bar and the 2 ( anti - bar ) orbits which are oriented perpendicular to the major axis of the bar ( contopoulos & mertzanides , 1977 , athanassoula , 1988 , binney & tremaine , 1987 ) .",
    "the 2 orbits exist if there is an inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) ring in the galaxy , which occur at radii where the relation @xmath26 is satisfied . here",
    "@xmath27 is the angular speed of the particle , @xmath28 is the angular speed of the bar and @xmath29 is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "physically , this means that a particle rotating in the bar potential with angular speed @xmath27 , will encounter successive crests of the bar potential at a frequency equal to half its epicyclic frequency . for radii close to the ilr radius ,",
    "a particle leads the bar and for radii near the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) , the particle lags behind the bar . at radii where @xmath30 , a particle is stationary in the rotating potential .",
    "more than one ilr can exist ; in fact from the optical rotation curve of ngc 253 , arnaboldi et al .",
    "( 1995 ) conclude that there are two ilrs in the bar of ngc 253 , one at a radius of 25and the other close to the center .    at the intersection of the 1 and 2 orbits ,",
    "gas clouds may collide , lose angular momentum and sink into the 2 orbits .",
    "simulations of gas evolution in bars have shown that an evolved bar has relatively more gas on the inner orbits than on the outer orbits ( friedli & benz , 1993 ) . within the bar of ngc 253 ,",
    "there is a @xmath31 diameter nuclear ring of dense star forming gas ( arnaboldi et al 1995 ) which may imply that there is a significant amount of gas on 2 orbits within the bar .",
    "we therefore use the 1 and 2 orbits to model the gas flow in the center of ngc 253 .",
    "this method of explaining gas kinematics in a bar potential was first introduced by binney et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for the distribution of gas in the galactic center .",
    "since then , this method has been applied to many barred galaxies ( e.g. achtermann & lacy , 1995 ) .",
    "this approach was used by peng at al .",
    "( 1996 ) to explain the distribution of dense gas in the bar of ngc 253 .",
    "peng et al .",
    "( 1996 ) plotted the position velocity ( p - v ) diagram for closed orbits in the bar model and compared it with the observed p - v diagram for the cs line emission .",
    "based on this comparison , they interpreted the regions of cs emission as the apocenters in the 1 and 2 orbits of the bar potential .    an alternative approach to determine the velocity field is the technique of hydrodynamic simulation of gas flow in a bar potential ( e.g. piner , stone and teuben , 1995 , athanassoula , 1992 ) . in hydro simulations it is possible to follow the evolution of the gas in the bar and to trace the formation of shocks in the gas",
    "however , the closed orbits method which is used in this paper , gives an explicit picture of the distribution of the gas .",
    "the distribution of the orbits shows the regions where gas can settle ( the orbits themselves ) and the regions where gas will pile up in shocks ( i.e. at the ends of the bar and the crossing points of the x1 and x2 orbits ) . in this method , the velocity field",
    "can also be explicitly obtained and compared with the observations .    although we also adopt a bar model and the closed - orbits method , which is similar to that of peng et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , our approach differs in at least two ways .",
    "first , in constructing the bar model , peng et al .",
    "( 1996 ) used a logarithmic bar potential and scaled all length scales with the disk rotation velocity @xmath32 . when comparing the closed orbits with the observed distribution of cs intensity and the p - v plot , peng et al .",
    "( 1996 ) scaled the orbits with @xmath33 .",
    "however , the velocity in the flat portion of the rotation curve is @xmath34 200 ( arnaboldi et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the value @xmath35 leads to a bar structure in which the 1 orbits extend out to @xmath820 resulting in a bar size of @xmath3645 .",
    "however , ir and optical observations estimate a bar size of @xmath8150 ( e.g. scoville et al . 1985 ) .",
    "our bar model incorporates parameters from the rotation curve and hence leads to a more realistic bar size . in the bar model presented in the following sections , we have used @xmath37=200",
    "this velocity gives a bar size of @xmath34200 , which is closer to the observed value than that used by peng et al .",
    "the large size of the bar may indicate that not all of the outer 1 orbits support gas and hence star formation ; most of the gas might have been funnelled into the inner orbits .",
    "the second difference between the work presented here and that of peng et al ( 1996 ) is that , in addition to comparing the model and observed p - v diagrams , we construct a model two - dimensional velocity field and compare it with the observed velocity fields shown in figs 1a and 1b . we show that an explicit comparison of the predicted and model velocity fields is indeed essential to determine whether the gas is actually moving on regular 1 and 2 orbits . because of the inherent degeneracy in projection , a wide range of models can fit the plot , whereas the added dimension in the 2-d velocity field helps differentiating the models .      for simplicity",
    "we have also adopted a logarithmic bar potential to model the velocity field .",
    "the potential is given by , @xmath38 ( binney & tremaine , 1987 ) , where @xmath39 is the velocity in the flat portion of the rotation curve of the galaxy , q is the non - axisymmetry parameter and @xmath40 is the core radius .",
    "if the bar is rotating with an angular velocity @xmath28 , then the equation of motion of a particle moving in the rotating frame of the bar is given by @xmath41 where * r * is the position vector of a particle in the bar , * v * is the velocity of a particle in the rotating frame of the bar and @xmath42 is the acceleration .",
    "the closed orbits in the bar potential were determined for different values of q and @xmath40 .",
    "some of the outer 1 orbits which are elongated along the length of the bar , are looped i.e. self intersecting at the ends .",
    "since gas clouds can not survive in these orbits due to collisions at the intersection points , these orbits were excluded while determining the velocity field .",
    "the free parameters were chosen such that the number of looped orbits is minimum .",
    "the parameters defining the bar potential are @xmath39 , @xmath28 , q and @xmath40 . of these four parameters ,",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath28 can be determined from the rotation curve .",
    "these parameters were taken from the optical rotation curve observed by arnaboldi et al .",
    "the velocity in the flat portion of their rotation curve is @xmath43 and the angular rotation velocity of the bar is @xmath44 48 kpc@xmath45 .",
    "the adapted parameters of the galaxy are given in table 1 .",
    "closed orbits were determined for values of the the non - axisymmetry parameter q in the range 0.7 to 0.9 . for lower values of q ,",
    "most of the closed orbits are looped . even for q=0.7 ,",
    "most of the outer 1 orbits are looped at the ends . for q=0.9 ,",
    "the bar structure is not as pronounced as that for the q=0.7 & 0.8 models but the non - axisymmetry is clearly seen .",
    "for both q = 0.8 and 0.9 , we obtain a large range of non - looped 1 and 2 orbits .",
    "the models presented in this paper are for q=0.8 & 0.9 .",
    "for both values of the parameter , there is a region of overlapping 1 and 2 orbits . at these points",
    "the clouds collide , lose angular momentum and sink into the center .",
    "this process is thought to be important for transporting gas into the center of the galaxy ( binney et al .",
    "1991 , friedli & benz 1993 ) .",
    "the other free parameter in the bar model , core radius @xmath40 , was varied from 0.05 pc to a few hundred parsecs . for @xmath40 less than a few parsecs",
    ", the velocity field resembles that of a simple flat rotation curve , i.e. it appears like the ` spider diagram ' observed in the disks of galaxies . for @xmath46200",
    "pc , distinct 1 and 2 orbits are not obtained .",
    "the range @xmath47200 pc gives a bar structure and a velocity field which is different from that expected from normal galactic rotation .",
    "we examined the velocity fields for values of core radii @xmath4850 pc , 100 pc and 150 pc and found them to be similar . in the following sections ,",
    "results are presented for @xmath49=100 pc .",
    "figures 2a & 2b show the closed orbits in the bar potential in the plane of the galaxy as they appear when the galaxy is viewed face on . for these orbits , the non - axisymmetry parameter q=0.8 and 0.9 respectively and the core radius @xmath50 pc .",
    "the closed orbits were also determined for the same value of q and @xmath40 = 50 pc and 150 pc .",
    "the overall appearance of the bar is the same for all the three cases .",
    "the extent of the 1 orbits is approximately 3.2 kpc ( @xmath51 ) in all the cases and their orientation is also similar .",
    "since gas will settle along non - looped 1 and 2 orbits in the bar potential , the radial extent of the bar in this model is 3.2 kpc .",
    "this radial extent is comparable to the size of the nir bar observed by scoville et al .",
    "the inner 2 orbits extend out to about 400 pc ( @xmath52 ) along the semi - major axis .",
    "the 2 orbits corresponding to different core radii do differ from one another . for core radii 100 pc and 150 pc ,",
    "the 2 orbits within 20 pc are aligned perpendicular to the other 2 orbits i.e. along the 1 orbits .",
    "the result is a bar within a bar structure .",
    "however , if the orbits are convolved with a two dimensional gaussian representing the telescope beam , these innermost perpendicular orbits , which are lying within the 2 orbits , are no longer distinct .",
    "thus in the final convolved velocity fields , there are no significant differences between models with core radii lying in the range @xmath47200 pc .    in order to compare the model velocity field with the observations ,",
    "the closed orbits were projected on to the plane of the sky .",
    "projections were made using the parameters given in table 1 .",
    "if the bar orbits are projected on the plane of the sky , the size and orientation of the 1 and 2 orbits change significantly as shown in figures 3a & 3b .",
    "the 1 orbits are aligned along the bar ( pa @xmath53 ) .",
    "the 2 orbits do not appear to be perpendicular to the 1 orbits .",
    "instead , these orbits are at a position angle of @xmath54 on the plane of the sky which is @xmath55 with respect to the major axis of the galaxy",
    ". this inner ring appears like a narrow ridge when projected on the plane of the sky even though it has a radius of @xmath56 pc . in the plane of the sky ,",
    "the inner ring is also nearly aligned with the major axis of the galaxy rather than the axis of the bar .",
    "this alignment is due to the projection of the 2 orbits on the sky and has been discussed by others ( e.g. b@xmath57ker , krabbe & storey , 1998 ) .",
    "this inner ring can be identified with the ring of star forming regions and supernova remnants which have been observed both in the optical and radio bands ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1995 , baan et al .",
    "a large number of compact radio sources have been observed in the inner 200 pc of ngc 253 which are dentified as supernova remnants and hii regions ( ulvestad & antonucci 1997 ) .",
    "a high concentration of dense molecular gas is also observed in the inner ring within the bar ( e.g. peng et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "a comparison of the extent of the projected bar orbits in fig 3 , with the observed extents of co , cs and hcn emissions , shows that the molecular gas must lie mainly on the 2 orbits .",
    "the molecuar gas lies within a radius of 30 from the center , within which , only one ( the inner most ) 1 orbit is present ( fig 3 ) . within the region of molecular emission ,",
    "the computed orbits are mainly of the 2-type for both q=0.8 and 0.9 .",
    "all the molecuar line observations thus indicate that gas has been channelled in to the inner most orbits inside the bar and the resulting high concentration of gas may have given rise to a burst of nuclear star formation .",
    "we note that in the bar model considered by peng et al ( 1996 ) , the molecuar gas is present in the outer 1 orbits as well .",
    "this difference is because , peng et al ( 1996 ) have implicitly assumed a smaller size for the bar .",
    "to obtain the velocity field expected in the bar model and compare it to the observations , the radial velocity at each point along the closed orbits was determined by tranforming the velocity components in the rotating frame of the bar to the inertial frame using @xmath58 the radial velocity is given by @xmath59sin(i).\\ ] ] hence , for every point * r(x , y ) * along the closed orbit , there is a corresponding radial velocity @xmath60 . using the above equation , it is possible to plot isovelocity contours for the radial velocities of the closed bar orbits projected onto the plane of the sky . to make a proper comparison with the observations , the model velocity field is convolved with an appropriate two dimensional gaussian representing the telescope beam .",
    "the comparison between model and observed velocity fields has the limitation that while the observed velocity field is `` weighted '' by the intensity of line emission , the model velocity field is based only on the distribution of closed orbits . in other words",
    ", the model implicitly assumes that the gas is uniformly distributed over all the closed orbits .",
    "figure 4a shows the model velocity field within the inner 8derived from the closed orbits shown in figure 2a ( q=0.8 ) .",
    "figure 5a is the corresponding velocity field for the orbits shown in figure 2b ( q=0.9 ) .",
    "the convolving gaussian function has a size @xmath61 which is similar to the resolution used by in their h92@xmath1 observations .",
    "a comparison of fig 1a with fig 3 reveals a remarkable correspondence between the observed and model velocity fields in the central region for both q values .",
    "the model velocity field predicts isovelocity contours which are nearly parallel to the major axis as observed . the s - shaped pattern in the observed field is also present to some extent in the model velocity field .",
    "it thus appears that most of the ionized gas observed in the h92@xmath1 line by can be associated with the 2 orbits of the bar potential .",
    "the velocity gradients along the major and minor axes of the galaxy in the inner region of the model can be quantitatively compared with the values obtained by . for q=0.8 and @xmath62 pc to 150 pc , the bar model predicts a velocity gradient along the minor axis of @xmath825 to 30 @xmath63 and the gradient along the major axis is @xmath6410 to 15 @xmath63 .",
    "measured a gradient of @xmath818 @xmath63 along the minor axis and @xmath811 @xmath63 along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the estimates from the model are thus comparable to the observed values .",
    "figure 4b shows the model velocity field for the parameter q=0.8 , on a larger scale of @xmath6530and figure 5b is the corresponding velocity field for q=0.9 .",
    "these figures should be compared with the co velocity field shown in figure 1b .",
    "the angular resolution is 5@xmath663 .",
    "the region covered in the figures includes mainly all of the 2 orbits .",
    "the model velocity field appears somewhat different for the two q values .",
    "the q=0.9 contours have a closer resemblance to the observed velocity field ( figure 1b ) than the q=0.8 model .",
    "the velocity field lines for q=0.9 are more spread out than the q=0.8 model and beyond 5have a downward slope which matches fairly well with the observed field . to see",
    "if the velocity field in figure 1b could be reproduced by including only a subset of the orbits , we first constructed the velocity field with just the 2 orbits and then with the 2 and a few of the inner 1 orbits . in both cases , we were not able to construct a velocity field similar to that observed in co and other molecular lines .",
    "we thus come to the conclusion that the model of the bar potential can only explain the velocity field close to the nucleus and not on the scale of @xmath67 shown in figure 1b .",
    "we conjecture that there is some perturbation within the bar which causes a change in the direction of the bar at progressively larger radii .",
    "such a change in the position angle of the bar with radial distance has in fact been observed by baan et al ( 1997 ) in the formaldehyde absorption line .",
    "they conclude that there must be a warped gas disk in the nuclear region which results in the changing direction of the bar with radius .",
    "however , the gross appearance of the bar does not seem to be affected by the perturbed velocity field . in secion 4",
    "we consider a possible scenario to explain the difference between the observed and model co velocity fields .",
    "our conclusion , based on a comparison of the velocity field is thus different from that of peng et al ( 1996 ) who compared the pv diagarms and concluded that the bar model can account for the velocities observed on a larger scale in molecular lines . in the next section",
    "we carry out such a comparison of the pv diagrams .",
    "the closed orbits in a bar potential can also be used to construct a diagram and has been done for ngc 253 and a few other galaxies in the literature ( e.g. peng at al .",
    "1996 , achtermann & lacy 1995 ) .",
    "but the resultant plot has two major differences with the observed diagram .",
    "first , in the model plot , v is just the rotational velocity of the gas in the bar potential ( v@xmath68 ) ; the velocity spread @xmath69 is not incorporated in the model .",
    "if the gas is cold , like molecular hydrogen , then @xmath69 may be relatively small and this difference may not be important .",
    "but if the gas is hot and turbulent , then @xmath69 may be fairly large .",
    "secondly , the model plot does not include information about the intensity ( i ) of the line emission from the gas . the second problem can be partially overcome by assuming that the intensity is proportional to the gas distribution in the bar . thus if the gas is uniformly distributed over the closed orbits , then the intensity is proportional to the number of orbits crossing through that region .",
    "we gridded the plane so that each grid point had a set of coordinates ( p , v , i ) .",
    "the size of the grid unit was chosen to be much smaller than the beam of the telescope .",
    "for example , in the inner 9of ngc 253 , we used a grid unit size of 0.3@xmath168 .",
    "the `` beam '' used to observe that region is 1.6@xmath1654 ( ) . this grid or 2-d matrix",
    "was then convolved with a 2-d gaussian matrix representing the beam of the telescope .",
    "figure 6a is the diagram of the nuclear ionized gas in ngc 253 observed in the h92@xmath1 radio recombination line by .",
    "there is a large velocity spread in the center of about 400 and two secondary peaks are seen on either side of the central peak . a velocity gradient ( @xmath8 10 ) is clearly seen .",
    "figure 6b is the beam - convolved model diagram of the inner 8constructed from the 1 and 2 orbits , as discussed above .",
    "considering the simplicity of our model , there is a reasonable agreement between the two plots .",
    "although the intensity contours in the model are in arbitrary units , there is a overall similarity which includes the presence of a main peak and two secondary peaks , although the latter are not as pronounced as in the observed p - v plot .",
    "furthermore , the velocity gradient is in the right sense .",
    "the velocity spread near the central peak and the magnitude of the velocity gradient are , however , less than the observed values in figure 6a . some of the differences may be caused by the fact that the observed plot is constructed from the h92@xmath1 radio recombination line which is emitted from hot , possibly turbulent , ionized gas for which the velocity spread could be quite large .",
    "this velocity spread is not included in the model .",
    "figure 7a shows a p - v diagram along the major axis observed on a much larger scale ( @xmath8 45 ) in co , using the ovro synthesis array ( sec 2 ) .",
    "there are two strong peaks on either side of the center and a gradient in velocity from ne to sw .",
    "figure 7b shows the beam - convolved model diagram over a similar region for q=0.8 .",
    "the plots for q=0.8 & 0.9 are very similar and so we have shown only the q=0.8 figure in the paper .",
    "there is a reasonable similarity between the model and observed plots .",
    "the extent and gradient of the velocity field shown in figure 7b agrees fairly well with that in figure 7a .",
    "on the basis of this plot , we could conclude that the model explains the observed kinematics of molecular gas .",
    "such a conclusion was in fact arrived at by peng et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who compared their observed diagram ( in the cs line ) with the 1 and 2 orbits projected on to the plane .",
    "there is also a similarity between the model plots in fig 7b and that observed in the cs line by peng et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . however , as shown in the previous section , there is no similarity between the observed co velocity field ( figure 1b ) and the model velocity field ( figures 4b & 5b ) .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the velocity field observed on larger scales in molecular gas ( canzian et al .",
    "1988 , peng et al .",
    "1996 and figure 1b ) is not explained by the bar potential , although the observed and model diagrams have many similarities .",
    "thus an agreement between the observed and expected diagram is a necessary but not sufficient condition to ascertain whether a particular model accounts for the observed velocity field .",
    "it is necessary to also compare the 2-d velocity field predicted by the model with the observations .",
    "a careful comparison of the larger scale ( @xmath2 pc ) observed and model velocity fields ( figures 1b and 7b ) shows that it may be possible to interpret the observed field as a twisted version of the model field .",
    "it is possible that the velocity field can indeed be due to the bar potential , but an additional perturbation has altered the velocity structure . in the next section",
    "we conjecture that this perturbation was caused by an accretion event that occurred in the recent past .",
    "ngc 253 is considered to be a strong , nuclear starburst galaxy with star formation concentrated within the inner 2 ring of the bar ( peng et al .",
    "1996 ) . though a bar can produce enhanced star formation in the center of a galaxy , the rapid fueling of gas in a bar can also be triggered by the accretion of a small satellite galaxy ( mihos & hernquist , 1994 ) . that such an accretion event may have occurred in ngc 253 has been suggested by and prada , gutierrez & mckeith ( 1998 ) .    in the previous section",
    ", we showed that the nuclear velocity field can be explained reasonably well by gas moving on 2 orbits within the bar .",
    "but as we move out to radii of @xmath830and farther , we find that there is no agreement with the observations .",
    "this disagreement is possibly due to the change in the position angle of the bar which has been observed on scales of @xmath641 kpc ( baan et al .",
    "such a perturbation of the bar potential could have been caused by the postulated merger event in the recent history of the galaxy .",
    "however , since the velocity field at large distances from the starburst region is regular and the outer hi contours are also regular ( combes 1977 , puche 1991 ) , the merger event has not caused any disruption on a large scale .",
    "therefore , if there was a merger in the recent past , then the accreted mass must be fairly small compared to the mass of the galaxy .",
    "the perturbation in the velocity field is observed at radii of @xmath830and larger , which corresponds to gas moving on the outer 2 orbits in the bar .",
    "the gas in the inner @xmath8100 pc , which is moving along inner 2 orbits , does not seem to have been perturbed since the observed velocity field is similar to that predicted by the model .",
    "this behavior may be explained by the difference in the rotation velocities for gas moving along the outer and inner 2 orbits .",
    "the rotation time scales for gas moving in the inner ( @xmath70100 pc ) orbits in our model is @xmath64 few times @xmath71 years while that for the outer 2 orbits is @xmath64 few times @xmath72 years .",
    "thus the model suggests that the very inner gas is moving at least ten times faster than the gas in the outer 2 orbits .",
    "perturbations in the central potential due to the accretion of a small galaxy may have been smoothed out by the faster rotating inner gas but its effect may still remain on the scale of the outer 2 orbits where gas is rotating more slowly .",
    "the accretion event may thus have occurred about @xmath4 years ago .",
    "we have used the above hypothesis to determine an approximate mass for the accreted galaxy using the theory of dynamical friction . from binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) ,",
    "the deceleration of a body of mass m moving through a region of mass density @xmath73 , is given by ,    @xmath74\\ ] ]    where x=@xmath75 and ln@xmath7610 to 20 ( see binney & tremaine , 1987 , pg 429 ) .",
    "the density @xmath73 can be determined from the dynamical mass within the inner @xmath77 ( @xmath64150 pc ) , which is @xmath78 ( anantharamaiah & goss , 1996 ) . the accreted mass is then given by ,    @xmath79\\delta t}\\ ] ]    if we assume that @xmath80 is the time taken for the mass m to sink through the inner 300 pc , then @xmath81 years .",
    "this time scale is similar to the time required for the perturbation to have been smoothed out in the inner 2 orbital region but the perturbation may still be persisting in the outer 2 orbital region .",
    "we have taken @xmath82 to be the rotation speed at 300 pc which is @xmath8110 ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1996 ) . using these values , the mass of the accreted body m @xmath83 .",
    "this mass is too small to represent a galaxy but it may represent the remains of an accreted galaxy which had most of its outer gas and stars stripped off during the infall . in deep optical images of ngc 253 , made using image enhancement techniques ( malin 1981 ; beck , hutschenreiter and wielebinski 1982 ) , a distortion in the disk is observed with a spur of emission protruding to the south .",
    "it is possible that this distortion is an imprint left by the merger event that occurred @xmath4 years ago as we have hypothesized above .",
    "also , watson et al . (",
    "1996 ) have detected four star clusters in the inner parsecs of ngc 253 , one of which , has a mass of @xmath84 and the others have masses of the order of @xmath85 .",
    "the more massive cluster may be the remains of the accreted mass which has perturbed the bar potential .",
    "we have attempted to model the observed nuclear velocity field of ionized and molecular gas in ngc 253 using a simple logarithmic bar potential .",
    "the parameters for the potential were derived from the optical rotation curve .",
    "the velocity field was determined from the 1 and 2 orbits in the bar potential and compared with observations of the h92@xmath1 ( anantharamaiah & goss 1996 ) and co lines .",
    "the results are summarized below .",
    "\\1 ) the 2 orbits , projected onto the plane of the sky , lie roughly along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the 2 ring appears very narrow and ridge like .",
    "we identify the ionized gas observed in the h92@xmath1 line as lying along the inner 2 orbits .",
    "also , when we compare the integrated co intensity maps in the literature with the model we find that the molecular gas is also distributed mainly over the 2 orbits .",
    "\\2 ) the velocity field within the inner 8predicted from the bar potential is similar to that observed by .",
    "the model predicts velocity gradients both along the major and minor axes .",
    "the isovelocity contours run parallel to the major axis as observed .",
    "the model diagram agrees reasonably well with the observations .",
    "\\3 ) the model velocity field on a larger scale ( @xmath845 ) is significantly different from the observed velocity fields in co and cs ( peng et al .",
    "however , the model diagrams agree reasonably with the observations .",
    "we therefore conclude that agreement in diagrams is a necessary but not sufficient condition to explain the complete velocity field .",
    "\\4 ) the observed velocity field on a larger scale ( @xmath845 ) appears to be a twisted version of the model velocity field with the direction of the gradient changing with radius .",
    "we suggest that this perturbation may have been caused by the accretion of an object with mass of @xmath83 about @xmath72 years ago .",
    "this accretion event may also have triggered the nuclear starburst observed in the galaxy .",
    "enhanced optical images of ngc 253 ( malin 1981 , beck et al 1982 ) show a distorsion in the outer regions of the galactic disk which may be a signature left by the merger event .",
