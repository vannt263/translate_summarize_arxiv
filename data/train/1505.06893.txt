    "in this paper we wish to investigate the following selection problem .",
    "let @xmath3 be a set of items .",
    "each item @xmath4 has a nonnegative cost @xmath5 and we wish to choose a subset of exactly @xmath1 items , @xmath6 , of the minimum total cost , @xmath7 .",
    "this problem has a trivial @xmath2-time algorithm which works as follows .",
    "we first determine in @xmath2-time the @xmath1th largest item cost , say @xmath8}$ ] ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and then choose @xmath1 items from @xmath9 whose costs are not greater than @xmath8}$ ] .",
    "the selection problem is a special , polynomially solvable version of the 0 - 1 knapsack problem , in which all the items have unit weights .",
    "it is also a special case of some other discrete optimization problems such as minimum assignment or a single machine scheduling problem with weighted number of late jobs criterion ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "it is also a matroidal problem , as the set of feasible solutions is composed of all bases of an uniform matroid  @xcite and it can be seen as a basic resource allocation problem  @xcite .",
    "suppose that the item costs are uncertain and suppose that we are given a _ scenario set _",
    "@xmath10 which contains all possible vectors of the item costs , called _ scenarios_. we thus only know that one cost scenario @xmath11 will occur but we do not know which one before a solution is computed .",
    "the cost of item @xmath4 under scenario @xmath12 is denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "no additional information for scenario set @xmath10 , such as a probability distribution , is provided .",
    "two methods of defining scenario sets are popular in the existing literature ( see , e.g ,  @xcite ) . in the _ discrete uncertainty representation _ , @xmath14 contains @xmath15 explicitly listed scenarios . in the _ interval uncertainty representation _",
    ", for each item @xmath4 an interval @xmath16 $ ] of its possible costs is specified and @xmath17 $ ] is the cartesian product of these intervals .",
    "the cost of solution @xmath18 depends now on scenario @xmath12 , @xmath19 , and will be denoted as @xmath20 . in order to choose a solution two robust criteria , namely the _ min - max _ and _ min - max regret _",
    "can be applied , which lead to the following two optimization problems : @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the set of all feasible solutions and @xmath24 is the cost of an optimal solution under scenario @xmath25 .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 is called a _ regret _ of solution @xmath18 under scenario @xmath25",
    ". both robust versions of the selection problem has attracted a considerable attention in the recent literature .",
    "it turns out that their complexity depends on the way in which scenario set @xmath10 is defined .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that under the discrete uncertainty representation min - max regret selection is np - hard even for two scenarios .",
    "repeating a similar argument used in  @xcite gives the result that min - max selection remains np - hard even for two scenarios .",
    "both problems become strongly np - hard when the number of scenarios is a part of input  @xcite . furthermore , in this case min - max selection is also hard to approximate within any constant factor  @xcite .",
    "several approximation algorithms for min - max selection has been recently proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the best known , designed in  @xcite , has an approximation ratio of @xmath27 . for the interval uncertainty representation both robust problems are polynomially solvable .",
    "the min - max version is trivially reduced to a deterministic counterpart as it is enough to solve the deterministic problem for scenario @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "min - max regret selection is more involved and some polynomial time algorithms for this problem have been constructed in  @xcite .",
    "the best known algorithm with running time @xmath29 has been shown in  @xcite .",
    "many real world problems arising in operations research and optimization have a two - stage nature .",
    "namely , a complete or partial solution is determined in the first stage and can be then modified or completed in the second stage .",
    "typically , the costs in the first stage are known while the costs in the second stage are uncertain .",
    "this uncertainty is also modeled by providing a scenario set @xmath19 , which contains all possible vectors of the second stage costs .",
    "if no additional information with @xmath10 is provided , then the robust criteria can be applied to choose a solution . in this paper",
    "we investigate two well known concepts , namely _ robust two - stage _ and _ robust recoverable _ ones and apply them to the selection problem . in the robust two - stage model ,",
    "a partial solution is formed in the first stage and completed optimally when a true scenario reveals . in the robust recoverable model",
    "a complete solution must be formed in the first stage , but it can be modified to some extent after a true scenario occurs .",
    "a key difference between the models is that the robust two - stage model pays for the items selected only once , while the recoverable model pays for items chosen in both stages with the possibility of replacing a set of items from the first to the second stage controlled by the recovery parameter .",
    "both models have been discussed in the existing literature for various problems .",
    "in particular , the robust two - stage versions of covering problems , the minimum assignment and the minimum spanning tree have been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the robust recoverable approach to the linear programming , the weighted disjoint hitting set , the minimum perfect matching , the shortest path , the minimum spanning tree and the @xmath30  knapsack have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "[ [ our - results ] ] our results + + + + + + + + + + +    in section  [ secrec ] we will investigate the robust recoverable model . we will show that it is np - hard for two scenarios and becomes strongly np - hard and not at all approximable when the number of scenarios is a part of input .",
    "a major part of section  [ secrec ] is devoted to constructing a polynomial @xmath31 algorithm for the interval uncertainty representation , where @xmath32 is the recovery parameter . in section  [ sec2st ]",
    "we will study the robust two - stage model .",
    "we will prove that it is np - hard for three second - stage cost scenarios .",
    "furthermore , when the number of scenarios is a part of input , then the problem becomes strongly np - hard and hard to approximate within @xmath33 for any @xmath34 , unless p = np .",
    "for scenario set @xmath35 , we will construct a randomized algorithm which returns an @xmath36-approximate solution with high probability . if @xmath37 , then the randomized algorithm gives the best approximation up to a constant factor .",
    "we will also show that for the interval uncertainty representation the robust two - stage model is solvable in @xmath2 time .",
    "before we show the formulations of the problems we recall some notations and introduce new ones .",
    "let us fix @xmath38 , and define    * @xmath23 , * @xmath39 , * @xmath40 , * @xmath41 , @xmath42 , * @xmath43 is the deterministic , first - stage cost of item @xmath4 , * @xmath44 is the second - state cost of item @xmath4 under scenario @xmath12 , where @xmath45 .",

    "we must choose a complete solution @xmath52 , i.e. such that @xmath53 .",
    "in the second stage additional costs occur for the selected items",

    "in this section we deal with the recoverable selection problem .",
    "consider first the discrete uncertainty representation , i.e. the problem with scenario set @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to observe that when all the first stage costs are equal to zero and the recovery parameter  @xmath57 , then recoverable selection is equivalent to min - max selection with scenario set @xmath35 .",
    "it follows from the fact that the solution formed in the first stage can not be changed in the second stage and thus @xmath58 .",

    "<S> this problem is a special case of 0 - 1 knapsack in which all the item weights are equal to  1 . </S>",
    "<S> its deterministic version has a trivial @xmath2-time algorithm , which consists in choosing @xmath1 items of the smallest costs . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper it is assumed that the item costs are uncertain . </S>",
