    "( @xcite , @xcite ) introduced the primitive / seifert knots , a natural generalization of primitive / primitive knots , and noted that surgery on such a knot at the surface slope is either a seifert fibered space or a connected sum of lens spaces . in @xcite , miyazaki and motegi showed that the primitive / seifert knots are mostly hyperbolic .",
    "since seifert fibered surgeries on hyperbolic knots are difficult to understand , the primitive / seifert knots are particularly interesting to study .",
    "a natural question is that of uniqueness : can a knot have more than one primitive / seifert representative with the same surface slope ? here , in section [ pt1 ] , we give examples of a two - parameter infinite family of knots with distinct primitive / seifert embeddings .",
    "we also ask a similar question : can a knot have two representatives , one primitive / seifert and one primitive / primitive , with the same surface slope ? in section [ pt2 ] , we discuss a family of torus knots that have this property .",
