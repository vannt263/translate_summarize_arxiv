    "it is well known that solution to an initial value problem for the inviscid dispersionless shallow water equations may develop a wave - breaking singularity after a finite time , when the first spatial derivatives become infinite .",
    "after the wave - breaking point , a formal solution becomes multi - valued and loses its physical meaning .",
    "the divergence of the spatial derivatives at the wave - breaking point suggests that higher - order terms must be taken into account .",
    "these terms can be either dispersive or dissipative in nature , or , as here , a combination of both .",
    "the form of the solution after the breaking time then strongly depends on the comparative values of the dispersion and dissipative terms .",
    "if dissipation can be neglected in favour of dispersion , the solution in a certain neighbourhood of the breaking point assumes the form of an expanding nonlinear oscillatory structure with a solitary wave train generated in the vicinity of its leading edge .",
    "this structure provides a dispersive resolution of a breaking singularity , and is an unsteady undular bore ( or a dispersive shock in a different terminology ) .",
    "unsteady undular bores have been studied extensively in the last thirty years on the basis of exactly integrable nonlinear wave equations .",
    "the original formulation of the problem was given by gurevich and pitaevskii ( 1973 ) who proposed to describe the expanding collisionless shocks ( a plasma analog of undular bores ) with the aid of the whitham - averaged equations for the integrable korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation .",
    "the gurevich - pitaevskii theory has been extended to other important integrable systems such as the nonlinear schrdinger and kaup - boussinesq equations ( see kamchatnov ( 2000 ) , for instance , for the detailed account on the gurevich - pitaevskii theory ) .",
    "the introduction of small dissipation can , in some cases , balance the dispersive effects so that the undular bore eventually acquires a steady profile , but remains oscillatory in space .",
    "the analytical study of steady ( frictional ) undular bores was initiated in the classical work of benjamin and lighthill ( 1954 ) on shallow water waves .",
    "another important work on the same subject , but in the context of collisionless plasma shocks with small dissipation , is sagdeev ( 1964 ) . in both works the authors use a mechanical analogy with a weakly damped nonlinear oscillator to explain the main observable features of undular bores : the formation of the lead solitary wave and degeneration into linear sinusoidal waves at the rear .",
    "it was also suggested that the undular bore transition conditions must be consistent with the conservation of mass and momentum across the transition zone , while the violation of hydrodynamic energy conservation is remedied by taking into account the generated waves .",
    "a simple model with an analytic description of shallow water frictional undular bore is provided by travelling wave solutions of the kdv - burgers equation ( see for instance whitham(1974 ) ) @xmath0 with a small dissipation coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "a detailed study of such solutions was made by johnson ( 1970 ) , who applied a direct perturbation procedure ( kuzmak 1959 ) to the periodic solution of the unperturbed ( @xmath2 ) equation ( the kdv cnoidal wave ) , and performed matching of the leading order approximation with the solitary wave to obtain a closed description .",
    "johnson s ( 1970 ) solution has been used by smyth ( 1988 ) for the description of the effect of small dissipation on resonant flow over topography .    the description of the undular bore on the basis of the steady travelling wave solutions of the kdv - burgers equation has two inherent restrictions : ( i ) as it is based on a unidirectional equation , it does not reveal the transition ( jump ) conditions across the undular bore and can link any two given constant states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 ; ( ii ) it describes only the established ( steady ) regime , and says nothing about the undular bore formation .",
    "the further development of the whitham modulation theory ( whitham ( 1965 , 1974 ) ) in 1970 - 80s due to gurevich and pitaevskii ( 1973 , 1987 ) , lax , levermore and venakides ( see the review ( 1994 ) and references therein ) , flaschka , forest and mclaughlin ( 1982 ) , dubrovin and novikov ( see the review ( 1989 ) and references therein ) and many other authors , has made it clear that the consistent description of undular bores ( both conservative and frictional ) should be made in the framework of the hydrodynamic - type whitham equations describing the evolution of nonlinear modulated waves . although the whitham equations , based on averaging over the periodic wave family , correspond to the leading order of a direct perturbation procedure , which formally diverges when the wave period tends to infinity ( the solitary wave limit ) , their solutions reveal only a weak singularity at the leading edge of the undular bore ( see gurevich and pitaevskii ( 1973 , 1987 ) ) and yield the correct value for the lead solitary wave amplitude ( while its position , of course , is not determined accurately ) .",
    "also , the whitham equations have been shown to inherit an integrable ( or perturbed integrable ) structure from the original system and allow in some cases the effective construction of exact _ global _ solutions using powerful methods developed in the theory of finite - gap integration , and in the theory of integrable hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type ( tsarev ( 1985 , 1990 ) , dubrovin and novikov ( 1989 ) ) .",

    "cubic \" breaking point has been studied in ( el , grimshaw and kamchatnov , 2005 ) . an asymptotic theory of the formation of soliton trains from a `` big '' enough initial pulse for the kaup - boussinesq system was developed by kamchatnov , kraenkel and umarov , 2003 .",
    "the modulation equations for the kdv - burgers equation were derived by gurevich and pitaevskii ( 1987 ) and avilov , krichever and novikov ( 1987 ) .",
    "other forms of the dissipative term have been considered by gurevich and pitaevskii ( 1991 ) ( boundary layer - type ) , and myint and grimshaw ( 1995 ) ( boundary layer dissipation and rayleigh friction ) . in their work on the modulation theory of the kdv - burgers equation , gurevich and pitaevskii ( 1987 ) deduced an exact steady solution of the whitham system corresponding to the steady undular bore .",
    "it is worth noting that their solution exactly coincides with the leading - order perturbation solution to ( [ kdvb ] ) obtained much earlier by johnson ( 1970 ) .",
    "avilov , krichever and novikov ( 1987 ) have shown numerically that this solution is indeed the large - time asymptotic modulation solution of ( [ kdvb ] ) with the initial conditions in the form of a smooth step .",
    "a general procedure for obtaining perturbed modulation system for the kdv equation , based on the finite - gap integration machinery , was formulated by forest and mclaughlin ( 1984 ) . a more effective method for the case of periodic modulated waves ,",
    "applicable not only to the perturbed kdv equation , but also to the whole perturbed akns hierarchy has recently been designed by kamchatnov ( 2004 ) .    in this paper , we apply kamchatnov s procedure to the kaup - boussinesq system modified by a small burgers - like dissipative term .",
    "being bi - directional , this system allows a more realistic modelling of frictional undular bores than the kdv - burgers equation ( [ kdvb ] ) .",
    "we distinguish several characteristic stages of the undular bore evolution and construct exact solutions of the whitham equations describing the initial ( unsteady ) and final ( steady ) stages of evolution of the kbb undular bore .",
    "the methods used in this paper also allow for the analytic description of undular bores generated in presence of an external force .",
    "in particular , an important class of problems of this kind occurs in the description of resonant flow over topography ( see grimshaw & smyth ( 1986 ) and smyth ( 1987 , 1988 ) ) .",
    "we consider formation of a frictional undular bore in the kaup - boussinesq system modified by a small viscous term . in dimensionless variables",
    "this system has the form : @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the height of the water surface above a horizontal bottom , @xmath8 is related to the horizontal velocity field averaged over depth ( see ( kaup ( 1976 ) for the detailed derivation of the inviscid system ) and @xmath9 is a small viscosity coefficient .",
    "we shall call eq .",
    "( [ kbb ] ) the kaup - boussinesq - burgers ( kbb ) system .",
    "note that the frictional term appears only in the second equation , which represents the momentum balance , and is absent in the first equation which represents the mass balance .",
    "also , the derivation of this system requires that the frictional term is a small term , of the same order as the small dispersion term . in the sequel ,",
    "however , we will be treating the frictional term as a small perturbation to an inviscid system .",
    "compared to the kdv - burgers equation ( [ kdvb ] ) , the kbb system ( [ kbb ] ) has the essential advantage of modelling bi - directional wave propagation , so the undular bore description would necessarily include transition conditions , which should be consistent with the jump conditions following from the conservation laws of the system ( [ kbb ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the kbb system ( [ kbb ] ) is a perturbed integrable system , which retains the advantage of amenability to an effective analytic study .",
    "a drawback of the kbb system as a model system is the presence of a high - wavenumber instability of the constant solutions .",
    "that is , the linearized equations allow for growing waves at large wavenumbers ( see el , grimshaw , & pavlov 2001 ) .",
    "also , there is the disadvantage for the description of undular bores that there is no  physical \" momentum conservation law , which leads to formally  nonphysical \" transition conditions .",
