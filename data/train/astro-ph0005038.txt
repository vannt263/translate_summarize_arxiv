    "the decay of a discontinuity separating two constant initial states ( _ riemann problem _ ) has played a very important role in the development of numerical hydrodynamic codes in classical ( newtonian ) hydrodynamics after the pioneering work of godunov ( 1959 ) . nowadays , most modern high - resolution shock - capturing methods ( leveque 1992 ) are based on the exact or approximate solution of riemann problems between adjacent numerical cells and the development of efficient riemann solvers has become a research field in numerical analysis in its own ( see , e.g. , the book of toro 1997 ) .",
    "riemann solvers began to be introduced in numerical relativistic hydrodynamics at the beginning of the nineties ( mart , ibez & miralles 1991 ) .",
    "presently , the use of high - resolution shock - capturing methods based on riemann solvers is considered as the best strategy to solve the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics in nuclear physics ( heavy ion collisions ) and astrophysics ( stellar core collapse , supernova explosions , extragalactic jets , gamma - ray bursts ) .",
    "this fact has caused a rapid development of riemann solvers for both special and general relativistic hydrodynamics ( see , e.g. , the reviews by ibez & mart 1999 , mart & mller 1999 ) .    in a previous paper ( mart & mller 1994 ;",
    "paperi in what follows ) , we derived the analytical solution of the riemann problem for an ideal gas in special relativistic hydrodynamics for initial states where the flow is normal to the initial discontinuity .",
    "this solution has proven to be a useful for ( i ) the generation of analytical solutions to test relativistic hydrodynamic codes , and ( ii ) the development of numerical hydrodynamic codes based on an exact riemann solver ( e.g. , mart & mller 1996 ; wen , panaitescu & laguna 1997 ) . because the solution only holds for flows which are normal to the initial discontinuity , numerical simulations based on the exact riemann solver of mart & mller ( 1994 ) are restricted to one - dimensional ( 1d ) flows .",
    "balsara ( 1994 ) and dai & woodward ( 1997 ) have circumvented this restriction at the price of constructing multi - dimensional godunov schemes using a riemann solver based on the two - shock approximation where the rarefaction wave is treated as a shock wave .",
    "an iterative relativistic nonlinear riemann solver that takes into account the effects of nonvanishing tangential velocity components has already been implemented by falle & komissarov ( 1996 ) for riemann problems involving two strong rarefactions . finally , we note that the effect of the tangential velocity on the properties of simple waves and shocks has usually been ignored in relativistic hydrodynamics , because it is always possible to choose a reference frame in which the tangential velocity vanishes on both sides of the simple wave or shock . in the case of a riemann problem",
    "this reference frame does not exist .",
    "the general solution can not be constructed in terms of the solution of the purely normal flow case and by means of a single lorentz transformation .    in the following",
    "we derive the exact solution of a riemann problem in minkowski spacetime with arbitrary tangential velocities .",
    "the solution can be implemented in multidimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic codes based on directional splitting , because it allows the computation of the numerical fluxes at every zone interface .",
    "furthermore , according to recent work by pons et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who solve the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics using special relativistic riemann solvers , this exact solution can also be implemented in general relativistic hydrodynamic codes .",
    "the exact solution also allows one to test the accuracy of other approximate riemann solvers and codes .    in this paper",
    "we closely follow the structure and notation used in paper i , where one can also find the basic references for the theory of relativistic simple waves and shocks , first discussed by taub ( 1948 ) .",
    "two key references in the theory of relativistic fluids are the review by taub ( 1978 ) and the book by anile ( 1989 ) .",
    "the main idea behind the solution of a riemann problem ( defined by two constant initial states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , left and right of their common contact surface ) is that the self - similarity of the flow through rarefaction waves and the rankine - hugoniot relations across shocks allow one to connect the intermediate states @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with their corresponding initial states , @xmath4 .",
    "the analytical solution of the riemann problem in classical hydrodynamics ( see , e.g. , courant and friedrichs 1948 ) rests on the fact that the normal velocity in the intermediate states , @xmath5 , can be written as a function of the pressure @xmath6 in that state ( and the flow conditions in state @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , once @xmath6 is known , @xmath5 and all other unknown state quantities of @xmath2 can be calculated . in order to obtain the pressure @xmath6",
    "one uses the jump conditions across the contact discontinuity , which are given by p_l * = p_r * (= p _ * ) v^n_l*(p _ * ) = v^n_r*(p _ * ) .",
    "[ vp0 ] equation ( [ vp0 ] ) is an implicit algebraic equation in @xmath7 and can be solved by means of an iterative method .",
    "the function @xmath8 is constructed by using the relations across the corresponding wave connecting the states @xmath4 and @xmath9 .    in the case of relativistic hydrodynamics",
    "the same procedure can be followed , the major difference with classical hydrodynamics stemming from the role of tangential velocities . while in the classical case the decay of the initial discontinuity does not depend on the tangential velocity ( which is constant across shock waves and rarefactions ) , in relativistic calculations the components of the flow velocity are coupled through the presence of the lorentz factor in the equations . in addition , the specific enthalpy also couples with the tangential velocities , which becomes important in the thermodynamically ultrarelativistic regime .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "first , in  2 we present the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics for a perfect fluid in 3 spatial dimensions . in  3 and  4",
    "we summarise the properties of the flow across rarefaction waves and shocks , respectively , and explain how to obtain the pressure and velocities behind the corresponding waves as a function of the state ahead the waves . in  5 we combine the results from the two previous sections to solve the riemann problem .",
    "finally , in  6 we discuss the implementation of the solution in numerical relativistic hydrodynamics . throughout the paper",
    "we will recover the corresponding purely normal flow expressions whenever it is of interest .",

    "coordinates , @xmath19 , the minkowski metric tensor @xmath20 is given by ^=diag(-1,1,1,1 ) .",

    "the above system is closed by an equation of state ( eos ) which we shall assume as given in the form @xmath23 .",
    "the normalization condition of the velocity ( [ norm ] ) leads to u^ = w(1,v^x , v^y , v^z ) where @xmath24 , the lorentz factor , is w = ( 1-v^2)^-1/2 and v^2 = ( v^x)^2 + ( v^y)^2 + ( v^z)^2 .",
    "the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics admit a conservative formulation which has been exploited in the last decade to implement high - resolution shock - capturing methods . in minkowski space time",

    "after some manipulation , the system ( [ xi1])-([xi5 ] ) can be reduced to just one ordinary differential equation ( ode ) and two algebraic conditions @xmath49 with @xmath41 constrained by ( [ xi6 ] ) . from equations ( [ rar2 ] ) and ( [ rar3 ] ) it follows that @xmath50 constant , i.e. , the tangential velocity does not change direction along rarefaction waves and it is only allowed to change its absolute value . notice that , in a kinematical sense , the newtonian limit ( @xmath51 ) leads to @xmath52 , but equations ( [ rar2 ] ) and ( [ rar3 ] ) do not reduce to the classical limit @xmath53 constant , because the specific enthalpy still couples the tangential velocities . thus , even for slow or moderately relativistic flows ( @xmath54 ) , the riemann solution presented in this paper must be employed for thermodynamically relativistic situations ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "the decay of an initial discontinuity gives rise , in general , to three elementary nonlinear waves ( see , e.g. , landau & lifshitz 1987 ) .",
    "two of them can be shocks or rarefaction waves , one moving towards the initial left state and the other towards the initial right state . between them ,",

    "an ideal eos with @xmath135 was assumed .",
    "the various quantities in the table are : the density in the intermediate state left ( @xmath136 ) and right ( @xmath137 ) of the contact discontinuity , the pressure in the intermediate state ( @xmath7 ) , the flow speed in the intermediate state ( @xmath112 ) , the speed of the shock wave ( @xmath74 ) , and the velocities of the head ( @xmath138 ) and tail ( @xmath139 ) of the rarefaction wave .

    "this result is easily deduced from ( [ xi6 ] ) which gives the velocities of the head ( @xmath138 ) and tail ( @xmath139 ) of the rarefaction wave , and from ( [ velshock ] ) which gives the shock speed ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "these three velocities tend to the normal velocity ahead of the wave ( @xmath141 ) when the corresponding tangential velocity ( @xmath142 ) tends to @xmath143 .",
    "although the structure of the solution remains the same ( left propagating rarefaction wave , right propagating blast wave ) the values in the constant intermediate states change by a large amount .",
    "the results show ( see figure4 and table1 ) that @xmath138 remains constant as long as @xmath133 is constant .",
    "the value of @xmath138 only depends on the left state , and decreases with increasing @xmath133 .",
    "the pressure in the intermediate state , @xmath7 , increases with increasing @xmath134 due to the larger effective inertia of the right state ( because of the increase of the lorentz factor of the right state ) .",
    "the velocity of the shock is determined by the competing effects of an increased @xmath7 and the larger inertia of the right state .",
    "the shape of the function @xmath64 ( see figure1 ) and its dependence on @xmath133 shows that both @xmath7 and @xmath112 decrease with increasing @xmath133 . on the other hand , as a change in @xmath133 does not alter the thermodynamic state , the flow evolution accross the rarefaction wave is along the same adiabat for any value of @xmath133 .",
    "this explains why @xmath144 gets smaller with increasing @xmath133 ( consistently with the decrease of pressure ) .",
    "thus , the net effect of tangential velocities on rarefaction waves is to evolve further along the adiabat , and to reach smaller intermediate pressure values .",
    "we have obtained the exact solution of the riemann problem in special relativistic hydrodynamics with arbitrary tangential velocities . unlike in newtonian hydrodynamics ,",
    "tangential velocities are coupled with the rest of variables through the lorentz factor , present in all terms in all equations .",
    "it strongly affects the solution , especially for ultra - relativistic tangential flows .",
    "the specific enthalpy acts as a coupling factor , too .",
    "it modifies the solution in thermodynamically relativistic situations ( energy density and pressure comparable to or larger than the proper rest - mass density ) even in slow flows .",
    "our solution has interesting practical applications .",
    "first , it can be used to check the different approximate relativistic riemann solvers developed by various authors in the last decade , and to test multi - dimensional hydrodynamic codes based on directional splitting .",
    "second , it can be used to construct multi - dimensional relativistic godunov type methods .",
    "the latter project is currently in progress and will be reported elsewhere . finally , using the procedure described by pons et al .",
    "( 1998 ) the exact solution can be used as a building block in a general relativistic hydrodynamic code .",
    "the computational cost of the exact riemann solver derived above is comparable to the one presented by mart & mller ( 1994 ) which is valid for purely normal flows .",
    "hence , when our exact riemann solver is applied to multi - dimensional flow problems , the difference in efficiency with respect to most linearized riemann solvers is reduced .",
