    "the fascinating physics of interpenetrating superfluids has recently become a topic of large interest due to the experimental realisation of multi - component , atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite . in the weakly interacting regime , these mixtures are well described by coupled mean - field gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) , and within this framework processes that lead to phase separation are well described  @xcite    while mean - field theories allow to study weakly correlated systems , it is also important and interesting to examine quantum mixtures in strongly correlated regimes . in these regimes , analytic solutions can often only be obtained in limiting cases . rather appealing results occur in strongly correlated regimes when the dimensionality is reduced . for quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) gas mixtures",
    "one finds that luttinger liquid theory predicts many interesting effects , which include de - mixing for repulsive interactions or spin - charge separation analogous to that found in 1d electronic quantum systems  @xcite .",

    "we use direct numerical diagonalization to study the ground - state properties of a mixture of ultracold bosons confined in a 1d trap over a wide range of correlations regimes , determined by the scattering properties between the atoms .",
    "these are supplemented by dmc calculations to confirm trends for systems with larger particle numbers .",
    "while the extreme cases in which all correlations are either weak or strong are well known , here we calculate and discuss the full phase diagram and especially the transitions between the different regimes .",

    "one immediately notices that the transition into the composite fermionization state happens at a finite value of @xmath60 , whereas the transition to the phase - separated regime happens already for very small values of @xmath54 .",
    "also the final state reached in the composite fermionization or the phase separation limit are very different .",
    "this difference in the final states can be understood by looking at the one - body density matrix ( obdm ) given by @xmath61 with a similar expression for @xmath62 .",

    "[ fig : coherence ] ]    since increasing the coupling constant will drive the system from the weakly to the strongly correlated regime , the coherence is a good quantity for identifying different regions in the phase diagram",

    "we normalize the obdm to 1 instead of the number of atoms . in figs .",
    "[ fig : coherence](a ) and ( b ) we show the largest occupation numbers for the a and the b species , respectively , over the whole range of interactions .",
    "note that the sum of all eigenvalues of each component sum up to 1 , in accordance with the chosen normalization .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence](a ) that the coherence in the a species decreases monotonically along the transition from the bec - bec ( @xmath75 ) to the tg - bec ( @xmath76 ) limit , as well as to the composite fermionization limit ( @xmath77 )",
    ". however , the transition for increasing @xmath16 at a finite @xmath9 shows that a maximum of coherence is reached for finite values of @xmath78 , which corresponds roughly to the value where the cloud de - mixing happens ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : densities](e ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "this maximum in coherence within species a is very surprising , as usually the presence of interactions is thought of as detrimental to coherence .",
    "here , however the presence of interactions within the a component to a certain degree `` counterbalance '' the interactions between the species and therefore allows to re - establish a higher degree of coherence again .",
    "note that after the de - mixing transition the coherence within species a goes down again , which is a clear indication that the enhancement is somehow mediated using the overlap with species b.    as expected , species b shows a large degree of coherence in all limits , except the composite fermionization one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence](b ) ) .",
    "however , the re - establishment of coherence along the transition from composite fermionization to the phase - separated limit happens over a definite and narrow region , which corresponds to the area in which the coherence in species a shows a maximum .",
    "one might , at this point wonder how the transition to phase separation manifests itself during the transition from the tg - bec to the phase - separated limit , as no obvious signature is visible in the coherence phase diagram .",
    "the answer is that phase separation happens already for small values of @xmath9 , which can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : densities](c ) .",
    "it is important to observe that there are no phase transitions in the whole phase diagram .",
    "the ground - state energy is always a continuous and smooth function of the parameters , so that the transition between the different regimes is of crossover type .",
    "closely related to the coherence in the sample is the entanglement between the two components .",
    "this can be quantified by calculating the von neumann entropy , @xmath79 , which is a function of the reduced density matrix for a single component @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the density matrix , @xmath82 is the system ground state , and @xmath83 is the fock vector for species b only .",

    "this is also consistent with the maximum found in the correlation strength within component a.    the interaction energy goes to zero in the tg - bec limit , which is the behaviour expected for a single component gas  @xcite , as the increased energy is now stored in the single particle harmonic oscillator energies . during the whole process the total energy is increased from @xmath99 to @xmath100 the energy for @xmath89 is shown in fig .

    "[ fig8 ] ( e ) and ( f ) report the density along the transition between composite fermionization and phase separation .",
    "we observe that the position of the two peaks in the density profile of a in the phase - separated and the composite fermionization limit is closer than in the balanced case ( compare with figs .",
    "[ fig : densities ] ( e ) and ( f ) ) . also , the crossover occurs now at a smaller value of @xmath16 . the average interaction energy @xmath128 ( figs .  [ fig7 ]",
    "( d ) and ( h ) ) decreases abruptly to zero after the crossover .",
    "we conclude that for larger imbalances , @xmath137 , the composite fermionization region is highly suppressed , and therefore the surviving limits are those associated to bec - bec , tg - bec and the phase - separated mixtures .    if the macroscopic limit is reached in such a way that the number of atoms in one of the species is fixed , the minority species plays role of an impurity which perturbs the majority species .",
    "the relative contribution of the minority species to the energy becomes smaller and polaronic description might be applicable .",
    "[ sec : conc ]    current experimental advances in ultracold atomic physics allow one to scrutinize the onset and evolution of correlations in few - atom bosonic fluids .",
    "small samples can be trapped , and their interactions can be largely tuned , thus providing a fantastic ground to understand how quantum many - body correlations build in small samples .",
    "binary mixtures are specially appealing as they provide the first step towards understanding the effect of environments on quantum systems in a controlled way .",
    "to advance in that direction , we study the effect of embedding a quantum fluid ( component a ) within a second quantum fluid ( b ) with tunable intra- and inter - species interactions at zero temperature .",
    "we fix the coupling constant of b - b interactions to that of ideal bosons , @xmath138 , and vary a - a and a - b interactions in a wide range , @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "this permits us to explore the phase diagram for a variety of regimes .",
    "the energy , one- and two - body correlation functions , density profiles and von neumann entropy are calculated exactly using diagonalization method . for larger system sizes ,",
    "the results are complemented with the energy and density profiles obtained by diffusion monte carlo method .",
    "we have described the transition between the following four limits : a ) bec - bec limit , where both components interact weakly and thus remain condensed , b ) bec - tg limit , where the two components interact weakly among each other and a has strong intra - species interaction , c ) composite fermionization limit , where the interaction between both species is large , inducing strong correlations within both species , and d ) a phase separation limit , where both the intra - species interaction in a and the inter - species interactions are large .",
    "we show that the transition between the different limits involves sophisticated changes in the one- and two - body correlations .",
    "the energetic properties change in a smooth way , with the energy and its derivatives remaining continuous , which implies a transition of a crossover type rather than a true phase transition . at the same time",
    ", the entanglement between the two components has a much sharper dependence on the interactions .",
    "this is demonstrated by reporting the von neumann entropy , which manifests a sharp peak along the transition between composite fermionization and phase separation .",
    "the evolution of the density profiles of a and b components is studied in detail both for the balanced and the imbalanced case .",
    "the effect of a large number of particles on the energy and the density profiles is discussed .",
    "we analyze the coherence properties by expanding the one - body density matrix in natural orbitals and obtaining the occupation numbers .",
    "we demonstrate that full condensation ( largest occupation number equal to one ) for a species is reached only in the bec - bec regime , while the weakly interacting b species also remains fully condensed in the tg - bec regime , and the condensation is almost complete in the phase separation regime .",
    "we argue that the described picture of the transition between four mentioned regimes remain valid also in a macroscopically large balanced mixtures , @xmath141 .",
    "contrarily , when the macroscopic limit is reached by increasing the number of atoms of the weakly - interacting species , @xmath142 , the composite fermionization limit is suppressed .",
    "therefore the phase diagram in this highly imbalanced case resembles the one expected within a mean - field approach .",
