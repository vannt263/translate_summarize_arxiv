    "in the occasion of the centennial of the death of a. volta , an important international conference was held in como ( italy ) on september 1927 , mainly devoted to the principles and applications of the new quantum mechanics . among the interesting contributions by bohr , heisenberg , pauli and others",
    ", it stands out the long speech by fermi aimed to point out the different behavior of the particles satisfying the bose - einstein statistics and those obeying the pauli exclusion principle , such as electrons .",
    "fermi started to investigate in this direction since 1923 @xcite , @xcite , when he published his ",
    "remarks on the quantization of systems with identical particles \" , where anticipated the formulation of the exclusion principle for generic molecules given by pauli one year later .",
    "soon after the appearance of the pauli paper , fermi recognized to have all the tools in order to build a theory of perfect gases satisfying the nernst principle at zero temperature , and on the 7th february , 1926 he presented the statistical distribution law for particles obeying the exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "such a law will be independently discovered later by dirac in the august of the same year .",
    "the most distinguished physicists of that epoch reached immediately the importance of the fermi work , and in the february of 1927 pauli applied it to the conduction electrons in a metal , explaining their anomalous paramagnetism .",
    "later on , at the como conference , sommerfeld reported on his recent works on thermal and transport properties in metals and succeeded in explaining , for the first time , the electron contribution to the specific heat of a metal .",
    "probably encouraged by the successful application to specific heat and entropy calculations , in the fall of 1927 , just after the como conference , fermi matured the idea of applying his statistical method to the completely degenerate state of the electrons in an atom , in order to evaluate the effective potential acting on the electrons themselves .",
    "he was aware of the fact that , since the number of the electrons involved is usually only moderately large , the results obtained will not present a very high accuracy .",
    "nevertheless , the method resulted to be very simple , and gave an easy - to - use expression for the screening of the coulomb potential accounted for by electrons as a whole .",
    "then fermi started to apply his method to several problems of atomic physics , and some more were suggested at that time to rasetti and other associates of his group in rome .",
    "the basic idea of the statistical method of atoms became one of his preferred ones , and practically the main activity of the fermi group at the physics institute in rome from 1928 to 1932 was devoted to this subject .",
    "the main idea of the statistical model of atoms is that of considering the electrons around the atomic nucleus as a gas of particles , obeying the pauli exclusion principle , at the absolute zero of temperature .",
    "the limiting case of the fermi statistics for strong degeneracy applies to such a gas .",
    "then , the maximum electron kinetic energy ( in a neutral atom ) , @xmath8 can be identified with that of a uniform gas of electrons whose number density is given by : @xmath9 note that the total energy has to be constant at any spatial point since , otherwise , a flux of electrons from one point to another would be established .",
    "the potential energy @xmath10 depends , thus , on the position through the electron charge density @xmath11 at that point : @xmath12 this was realized by thomas in 1926 @xcite and , independently , by fermi in the december of 1927 @xcite .",
    "fermi and many other relevant physicists were unaware that essentially identical conclusions had previously been reached by thomas , since the english researcher published his results on a journal which was probably not widespread through the physics community . according to rasetti @xcite ,",
    " fermi became acquainted with thomas paper only late in 1928 , when it was pointed out to him by one ( now unidentified ) of the foreign theoreticians visiting rome \" .",
    "it is also intriguing to note that for some time the statistical model was denoted as the fermi - thomas model rather then as the thomas - fermi one ( compare , for example the papers in refs @xcite,@xcite appeared in 1930 with that of sommerfeld in @xcite of 1932 ) .",
    "we further observe that thomas made use of only the exclusion principle ( in writing eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , while fermi considered also the dependence of the effective potential ( entering in eq . ( [ 3 ] ) ) on the temperature of the gas .",
    "such a difference , however , is not very significative since the number density of electrons in the occupied states of an atom reaches high values due to the small space region where they are placed .",
    "then , the electrons form a completely degenerate gas , and the correction to the effective potential reduces to a small term proportional to the temperature @xmath13 , which does not alter the main results of the model in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "the effective electrostatic potential is related to the electron charge density by means of the poisson equation , @xmath15 and substituting in this the expression in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , thomas and fermi found a second - order inhomogeneous differential equation for @xmath16 with a term proportional to @xmath17 : @xmath18 this equation allows the evaluation of the potential inside an atom with atomic number @xmath19 , using boundary conditions such that for the radius @xmath20 the potential becomes the coulomb field of the nucleus , @xmath21 while for @xmath22 : @xmath23 the additional condition for the total charge , @xmath24 is automatically satisfied , provided that eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) hold .    in order to simplify the differential equation in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , fermi introduced a suitable change of variables : @xmath25 with @xmath26 in terms of the new variables , eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) becomes ( for @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 ( a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath29 ) with the boundary conditions : @xmath30 the fermi equation ( [ 11 ] ) is a universal equation which does not depend neither on @xmath19 nor on physical constants ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "its solution gives , from eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) , as noted by fermi himself , a screened coulomb potential which at any point is equal to that produced by an effective charge @xmath32 as was immediately realized , in force of the independence of eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) on @xmath19 , the method gives an effective potential which can be easily adapted to describe any atom with a suitable scaling factor , according to eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) .      in order to evaluate ionization energies and similar quantities which are relevant for atomic physics observations , fermi and rasetti @xcite , @xcite",
    ", @xcite proceeded to apply and enlarge the above method to describe positive ions .",
    "they considered the ion of nuclear charge @xmath33 as a neutral atom of nuclear charge @xmath34 , to be treated with the statistical method , plus an extra proton in the nucleus .",
    "since the electrostatic potential for the atom of atomic number @xmath35 is , from ( [ 13 ] ) , @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 for the parameter @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) ) , the potential energy of one extra electron will be , at a first approximation , given by : @xmath39 .",
    "\\label{15}\\ ] ] with this formula , fermi and his associates in rome extended their calculations to many physical problems , obtaining quantities which well fitted the observations and the knowledge of the time .",
    "the method was further generalized for arbitrary positively charged ions by baker in june 1930 @xcite and corrected ( for an interpretational misunderstanding ) by guth and peierls six months later @xcite .",
    "the problem of the theoretical calculation of observable atomic properties is solved , in the statistical model approximation , in terms of the function @xmath40 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and satisfying the fermi differential equation ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "however , it was believed that the solution of such equation satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions in ( [ 12 ] ) could nt be expressed in closed form , so that some effort was made by thomas @xcite , fermi @xcite , @xcite and others @xcite in order to achieve numerical integration of the differential equation .",
    "thomas used a numerical method described by whittaker and robinson @xcite in order to solve the second - order differential equation for the electrostatic potential @xmath16 .",
    "he thus obtained a numerical table for some mathematical quantities from which one can deduce the values of @xmath16 as function of the distance @xmath41 from the nucleus .",
    "however , as already observed by baker @xcite , thomas numerical calculations of @xmath16 near @xmath42 are  slightly in error \" , and this influenced also some calculations by milne @xcite who directly applied the thomas theory as early as in 1927 .",
    "a similar effort was also pursued by fermi who built a numerical table for the values of the function @xmath43 obeying eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the numerical work was performed in approximately one week and , according to many testimonies @xcite , @xcite ( see the anecdote related to majorana ) , the table was ready as early as at the end of 1927 , although it was published only in the german paper of 1928 @xcite .",
    "the numerical values obtained by fermi were largely used not only by the members of the rome group , but even by many other physicists who dealt with atomic problems ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite ) .      by using standard but involved mathematical tools , in his paper @xcite",
    "thomas got an exact ,  singular \" solution of his differential equation satisfying only the condition ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "this was later ( in 1930 ) considered by sommerfeld @xcite as an approximation of the function @xmath44 for large @xmath29 ( and is indeed known as the  sommerfeld solution \" of the fermi equation ) , @xmath45 and sommerfeld himself obtained corrections to the above quantity in order to approximate in a better way the function @xmath43 for not extremely large values of @xmath29 .",
    "the goodness of the approximated expression was checked by sommerfeld comparing his results with the numerical values obtained by fermi @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing to observe that the solution in eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) was already known to majorana @xcite at the end of 1927 ( independently from thomas ) , who recognized its crucial role in determining the desired solution of eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) with boundary conditions eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) ( see below ) .",
    "an approximate solution for @xmath43 near @xmath46 was , instead , first considered by fermi @xcite , who obtained a series expansion for it .",
    "the reasoning is , probably , as follows . for @xmath29 near @xmath47",
    "we have @xmath48 , so that substitution into eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) results in @xmath49 by integrating this approximate equation we easily have @xmath50 for @xmath29 near the origin .",
    "the constant @xmath51 is obtained directly from the first condition in ( [ 12 ] ) , while @xmath52 was determined by fermi to assume the numerical value @xmath53 for the neutral atom .",
    "thus , the fermi approximation for @xmath54 results to be : @xmath55 according to rasetti @xcite , segr @xcite and amaldi @xcite , the paper in ref .",
    "@xcite was shown to majorana probably even before its publication .",
    "majorana then proceeded to improve the degree of approximation of the fermi formula ( [ 19 ] ) , and considered several other terms in the series expansion up to the sixth power of @xmath29 ( including both integer and half - integer powers ) .",
    "the method followed by him is a generalization of the frobenius method for differential equations @xcite ; its sketch is as follows .",
    "let us consider a solution of eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) , which can be rewritten as @xmath56 in the form @xmath57 the terms in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) with integer powers of @xmath29 account for the usual taylor series expansion , while those with half - integer powers attain to the frobenius one .",
    "the need for both terms is dictated by the fermi approximation underlying eqs .",
    "( [ 17])-([19 ] ) .",
    "the yet unknown coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 are then determined by substituting eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) and requiring that the coefficients of given powers of @xmath29 , appearing in the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , vanish .",
    "in such a way , one is able to obtain two iterative formulae for @xmath58 and @xmath59 coefficients .",
    "however , differently from what is usually found in the notebooks by majorana ( see @xcite ) , he did not succeed to obtain general expressions for the coefficients , but he stopped the series to the term @xmath60 ( thus considering a polynomial ) and evaluated only some coefficients .",
    "the corresponding expression looks like as follow : @xmath61 with @xmath62 , according to the fermi value .",
    "probably , majorana abandoned the complete series expansion in ( [ 21 ] ) because he realized that such a series does not converge to the desired solution .",
    "note , in fact , that the differential equation ( [ 11 ] ) or ( [ 20 ] ) is a non - linear equation , so that the series solution method can not , in general , be applied at all .",
    "it is however remarkable that , stopping the series in ( [ 21 ] ) to any power @xmath63 , the obtained polynomial diverges towards to @xmath64 for diverging @xmath29 , while from @xmath65 ( as considered by majorana ) onward the corresponding polynomial diverges towards @xmath66 , as can be seen in fig.1 . both behaviors , of course ,",
    "do not match the correct condition @xmath67 , but we point out that the first one , @xmath68 , is physically not acceptable ( see , for example , the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . eventually , we point out that the fermi approximation of the function @xmath43 near @xmath46 with a polynomial was later reconsidered by baker @xcite , who obtained terms up to the power @xmath69 . however , the coefficient of the last term presented by author is wrong ( compare with the correct majorana result in eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) ) .",
    "we have dwell on this point in order to remark the complexity of calculations , leading to the expressions for the coefficients in the polynomial expansion , due to the non - linearity of the equation considered .",
    "for example , in order to evaluate the coefficients @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) up to the term @xmath69 , we have to solve a set of @xmath71 coupled algebraic equations .",
    "note also that , due to the structure of the differential equation in ( [ 20 ] ) , for obtaining the correct expressions for the coefficients , we have to start with a polynomial in ( [ 21 ] ) with terms up to @xmath72 , rather than @xmath69 .",
    "the work described above on the polynomial approximation , performed by majorana , was only the first step towards an exact or semi - analytical solution to the fermi equation .",
    "we will indulge here on an anecdote reported by rasetti @xcite , segr @xcite and amaldi @xcite . according to the last author , ",
    "fermi gave a broad outline of the model and showed some reprints of his recent works on the subject to majorana , in particular the table showing the numerical values of the so - called fermi universal potential .",
    "majorana listened with interest and , after having asked for some explanations , left without giving any indication of his thoughts or intentions .",
    "the next day , towards the end of the morning , he again came into fermi s office and asked him without more ado to draw him the table which he had seen for few moments the day before . holding this table in his hand",
    ", he took from his pocket a piece of paper on which he had worked out a similar table at home in the last twenty - four hours , transforming , as far as segr remembers , the second - order thomas - fermi non - linear differential equation into a riccati equation , which he had then integrated numerically . \"    the whole work performed by majorana on the solution of the fermi equation , is contained in some spare sheets conserved at the domus galilaeana in pisa , and diligently reported by the author himself in his notebooks @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the fermi equation to an abel equation ( rather than a riccati one , as confused by segr ) proceeds as follows .",
    "let s adopt a change of variables , from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , where the formula relating the two sets of variables has to be determined in order to satisfy , if possible , both the boundary conditions ( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) has the correct behavior for large @xmath29 , but the wrong one near @xmath46 , so that we could modify the functional form of @xmath75 to take into account the first condition in ( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "an obvious modification is @xmath76 , with @xmath77 a suitable function which vanishes for @xmath54 in order to account for @xmath78 .",
    "the simplest choice for @xmath77 is a polynomial in the novel variable @xmath79 , as it was also considered later , in a similar way , by sommerfeld @xcite .",
    "the majorana choice is as follows : @xmath80 with @xmath81 as @xmath82 . from eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) we can then obtain the first relation linking @xmath79 to @xmath83 .",
    "the second one , involving the dependent variable @xmath84 , is that typical of homogeneous differential equations ( like the fermi equation ) for reducing the order of the equation , i.e. exponentiation with an integral of @xmath85 .",
    "the transformation relations are thus : @xmath86 substitution into eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) leads to an abel equation for @xmath85 , @xmath87 with @xmath88 note that both the boundary conditions in ( [ 12 ] ) are automatically verified by the relations ( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "we have reported the derivation of the abel equation ( [ 25 ] ) mainly for historical reasons ( see also the next section ) ; the precise numerical values for the fermi function @xmath43 were obtained by majorana by solving a different first - order differential equation @xcite .",
    "it is also remarkable that none of the majorana s colleagues and friends was aware of this , which however is well documented in the notebooks @xcite and in some other unpublished papers . instead of eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) , majorana chooses @xmath40 of the form @xmath89 now the point with @xmath46 corresponds to @xmath90 . in order to obtain again a first order differential equation for @xmath85 , the transformation equation for the variable @xmath84 involves @xmath75 and its first derivative .",
    "majorana then introduced the following formulas : @xmath91 by taking the @xmath79-derivative of the last equation in ( [ 28 ] ) and inserting eq .",

    "after some algebra , the final result for the differential equation for @xmath85 is : @xmath97 the obtained equation is again non - linear but , differently from the original fermi equation ( [ 11 ] ) , it is first - order in the novel variable @xmath79 and the degree of non - linearity is lower than that of eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the boundary conditions for @xmath85 are easily taken into account from the second equation in ( [ 28 ] ) and by requiring that for @xmath98 the sommerfeld solution ( eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) with @xmath99 ) be recovered : @xmath100 here we have denoted with @xmath101 the initial slope of the thomas - fermi function @xmath43 which , for a neutral atom , is approximately equal to @xmath102 .",
    "the solution of eq .",

    "it is remarkable that the series expansion in eq .",
    "( [ 33 ] ) is uniformly convergent in the interval @xmath106 $ ] for @xmath107 , since the series @xmath108 of the coefficients converges to a finite value determined by the initial slope @xmath109 .",

    "it is instructive to give a look at the numerical results for the thomas - fermi function @xmath43 obtained by several authors with different methods . as already pointed out , thomas firstly reported numerical values for the potential inside atoms . since his approach involved a differential equation equivalent to the fermi equation but with a different mathematical structure ( see @xcite ) , which does not make direct use of the universal function @xmath43 , the comparison between the thomas numerical results and those obtained by fermi and others will not be considered here .",

    "peculiarities of the electronic structure , underlying particular properties of the elements , can not be accounted for by a statistical method . nevertheless , as noted by fermi himself ,",
    "the agreement with the experimental observations is satisfactory .",
    "the next step was to evaluate the energy levels of the quantum states of all ( heavy ) elements .",
    "this was done by fermi in @xcite for the s - levels ; in particular he calculated the rydberg correction for the s - levels of any element from the approximate solution of the schrdinger equation for an s - electron with zero energy .",
    "the energy levels corresponding to the angular momentum @xmath142 ( m - levels ) for the x - ray spectrum were , instead , considered by rasetti @xcite .",
    "again the experimental points fluctuate closely about the predicted values .",
    "a slightly different application of the thomas - fermi potential was carried out by gentile and majorana @xcite , who calculated the doublet separation due to spin for optical and x - ray levels of some elements , applying the dirac theory .",
    "moreover they also evaluated the ratio of the intensities of the absorption s - p lines in the alkali spectra .",
    "some further applications were performed by the fermi group during @xmath143 , mainly devoted to explain the properties of the rare earths and the electron affinity of the halogens , which were discussed in a restricted conference in leiprig under the chairmanship of p. debye @xcite .",
    "several generalization of the thomas - fermi method for atoms were proposed as early as in @xmath143 by majorana , but they were considered by the physics community , ignoring the majorana unpublished works , only many years later ( see , for example , the review in @xcite ) .    indeed , in sect .",
    "16 of volumetto ii @xcite , majorana studied the problem of an atom in a weak external electric field @xmath144 , i.e. atomic polarizability , and obtained an expression for the electric dipole moment for a ( neutral or arbitrarily ionized ) atom .",
    "furthermore , he also started to consider the application of the statistical method to molecules , rather than single atoms , studying the case of a diatomic molecule with identical nuclei ( see sect .",
    "12 of volumetto ii @xcite ) .",
    "the effective potential in the molecule was cast in the form :    @xmath145    @xmath146 and @xmath147 being the potentials generated by each of the two atoms .",
    "the function @xmath148 must obey the differential equation for @xmath16 , @xmath149 ( @xmath150 is a suitable constant ) , with appropriate boundary conditions , discussed in @xcite .",
    "majorana also gave a general method to determine @xmath16 when the equipotential surfaces are approximately known ( see sect .",
    "12 of volumetto iii @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , writing the approximate expression for the equipotential surfaces , as functions of a parameter @xmath151 , as @xmath152 he deduced a thorough equation from which it is possible to determine @xmath153 , when the boundary conditions are assigned .",
    "the particular case of a diatomic molecule with identical nuclei was , again , considered by majorana using elliptic coordinates in order to illustrate his original method @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have depicted the genesis and the first developments of the statistical model of atoms introduced by thomas and fermi in 1926 - 27 . far from being complete ,",
    "our account has focused on the results achieved by fermi and his group in rome , as given evidence by many articles published in widespread journals .",
    "we have also pointed out the practically unknown contribution to the model given by majorana , who was introduced to the subject by fermi himself .",
    "one of the major results reached by majorana as early as in the beginning of 1928 is its solution ( or , rather , methods of solutions ) of the thomas - fermi equation .",
    "this plays an important role in the rapid and accurate determination of the effective electrostatic potential in atoms , required in physical applications , as well as in studying the mathematical properties of the differential equation itself , anticipating later ( mambriani , scorza - dragoni , miranda 1929 - 1934 ) and much later ( hille 1969 ) achievements .",
    "majorana works on these topics ( as well as in many other ones ) is contained in his notebooks @xcite and was not published by the author : it is remained unknown until recent times @xcite .",
    "a brief account of the statistical model of atoms , which is widely known , has been reported in sect . 2 , and follows quite closely the fermi approach .",
    "wide room has been made to the solution of the thomas - fermi equation in sect .",
    "3 ; the interested reader , looking for more technical details , can benefit from a reading of papers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "early applications of the thomas - fermi model , performed by the fermi group ( as well as some other people ) , essentially dealt with atomic spectroscopy , and have been discussed above in sect .",
    "moreover we have also highlighted some completely novel ( for that time ) applications of the statistical model by majorana , who employed it for studying atoms in external fields ( atomic polarizability ) and molecules .    from what discussed here ,",
    "it is then evident the considerable contribution given by majorana even in the achievement of the thomas - fermi model , anticipating , in many respects , some important results reached later by leading specialists ."
