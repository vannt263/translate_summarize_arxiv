    "the novelty of our analysis of quasilinear wave and klein - gordon equations lies in combining the methods used by vasy and the author @xcite to treat semilinear equations on static asymptotically de sitter ( and more general ) spaces with the technology of pseudodifferential operators with non - smooth coefficients in the spirit of beals and reed @xcite which is used to understand the regularity properties of operators like @xmath34 in the above theorem .",
    "we expect that our approach , appropriately adapted , also works in a variety of other settings , for instance on asymptotically minkowski spaces in the sense of baskin , vasy and wunsch @xcite , or even on asymptotically kerr - de sitter spaces , where however a much more delicate analysis is necessary in view of issues coming from trapping .",
    "compactifying our spacetime at infinity puts equation into a b - framework , where it reveals a rich microlocal structure ( in particular , the operator @xmath34 is a perturbation of one that has radial points at the boundary ) .",
    "then , as in @xcite , rather than solving an evolution equation for a short amount of time , controlling the solution using ( almost ) conservation laws and iterating , we use a different iterative procedure , where at each step we solve a linear equation , with non - smooth coefficients , of the form @xmath38 _ globally _ on @xmath0-based b - sobolev spaces or analogous spaces that encode partial expansions .",
    "since the non - linearity @xmath39 ( as well as @xmath40 ) must be well - behaved relative to these , we work on high regularity spaces ; recall here that @xmath41 is an algebra for @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , we need to prove decay ( or at least non - growth ) for solutions of so that @xmath39 can be considered a perturbation .",
    "the allowed asymptotics of solutions to the linear equation are captured by the normal operator family of @xmath43 at infinity , encoded as a compactification of the space . by virtue of the asymptotics of linear waves on ( approximately ) static ( asymptotically ) de sitter spaces , this family will for",
    "all @xmath44 be a family of operators with _ smooth _ coefficients , thus one can use results of vasy @xcite to understand its behavior , in particular resonances , i.e.  the location of the poles of the inverse mellin transformed family and their structure , as well as stability results . just as in the semilinear setting , we need to require the resonances to lie in the ` unphysical half - plane ' @xmath45 ( a simple resonance at @xmath46 is fine as well ) , since resonances in the ` physical half - plane ' @xmath47 would allow growing solutions to the equation , making the non - linearity non - perturbative and thus causing our method to fail .",
    "the linear analysis of equations like is carried out in section  [ secglobalforsecond ] in two steps : the invertibility on high regularity spaces which however contain functions that are growing at @xmath48 ( see theorem  [ thmwaveglobalsolvecont ] ) and the proof of decay corresponding to the location of resonances ( see theorem  [ thmexistenceandexpansion ] ) .    in the iteration scheme ,",

    "now @xmath43 has leading order coefficients in @xmath52 and subprincipal terms with regularity @xmath51 , and to keep the iteration running , we need that the solution operator for @xmath43 maps @xmath51 to @xmath52 ( the loss of one derivative being standard for hyperbolic problems ) . in other words , there is a delicate balance of the regularities involved ; at the heart of this paper thus lies a robust regularity theory for operators like @xmath43 on manifolds with boundary .",
    "the main ingredient of the framework in which will analyze b - operators with non - smooth coefficients on manifolds with boundary is a partial calculus for what we call _ b - sobolev b - pseudodifferential operators _ ; for brevity , we will refer to these as ` non - smooth operators ' to distinguish them from ` smooth operators ' , by which we mean standard b - pseudodifferential operators , recalled below .",
    "b - sobolev b-ps.d.os are ( generalizations of ) b-ps.d.os with coefficients in b - sobolev spaces , which partly extends a corresponding partial calculus on manifolds without boundary in the form developed by beals and reed @xcite .",
    "this calculus allows us to prove microlocal regularity results  that are standard in the smooth setting  for b - sobolev b-ps.d.os , namely elliptic regularity , real principal type propagation of singularities , including with ( microlocal ) complex absorbing potentials , and propagation near radial points ; see section  [ secpropagation ] .",
    "we only develop a local theory since all regularity results we need are local in character due to the compactness of the underlying ( compactified ! ) manifold .",

    "let us assume @xmath68 .",
    "on @xmath62 , we naturally have the b - tangent bundle @xmath69 , whose sections are the b - vector fields @xmath70 , i.e.  vector fields tangent to the boundary ; in local coordinates @xmath71 near the boundary , @xmath69 is spanned by @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the enveloping algebra of @xmath74 of b - differential operators",
    "is denoted @xmath75 .",
    "the b - cotangent bundle , the dual of @xmath69 , is denoted @xmath76 and spanned by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and we have the b - differential @xmath79 , where the last map comes from the natural map @xmath80 .",
    "now , the metric @xmath40 on @xmath62 is a smooth , symmetric , lorentzian signature ( taken to be @xmath53 ) section of the second tensor power of @xmath69 .",
    "the associated dalembertian ( or wave operator ) @xmath81 thus is an element of @xmath82 and therefore naturally acts on weighted b - sobolev spaces @xmath83 , where we define @xmath84 for @xmath12 as in and for general @xmath85 using duality and interpolation .",
    "denote by @xmath86 the space of restrictions of @xmath87-functions with support in @xmath88 to @xmath7 ; that is , elements of @xmath86 are supported at @xmath66 and extendible at @xmath67 in the sense of hrmander ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  b ) .",
    "finally , let @xmath89 be the space of all @xmath90 which near @xmath33 asymptotically look like a constant plus an @xmath91-function , i.e. for some @xmath92 , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , @xmath95 near @xmath46 , is a cutoff near @xmath63 ; for such a function @xmath90 , define its squared norm by @xmath96 our main theorem then is :    [ thmintrofull ] let @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "assume that for @xmath99 , @xmath100 are continuous , @xmath40 is locally lipschitz , and @xmath101 for @xmath102 with norm @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is continuous and non - decreasing .",
    "then there is a constant @xmath105 so that the following holds : if @xmath106 , then for small @xmath107 , there is @xmath108 such that for all @xmath109 with norm @xmath110 , there exists a unique solution @xmath111 of the equation @xmath112 with norm @xmath103 , and in the topology of @xmath113 , @xmath90 depends continuously of @xmath114 .",
    "see theorem  [ thmappwaveexistence ] for a slightly more general statement ; in particular , we can still guarantee the existence of solutions if we merely make a continuity assumption on @xmath40 for @xmath115 and a weak lipschitz assumption on @xmath39 .",
    "another case we study is @xmath116 , i.e.  we only allow conformal changes of the metric ; here , one can partly improve the above theorem , in particular allow non - linearities of the form @xmath117 ; see section  [ subsecappconformal ] .",
    "the point of the lipschitz assumptions on @xmath39 in all these cases is to ensure that @xmath118 has a sufficient order of vanishing at @xmath119 so that @xmath118 can be considered a perturbation of @xmath34 ; quadratic vanishing is enough , but slightly less ( simple vanishing will small lipschitz constant near or at @xmath46 ) also suffices .",
    "similar results hold for quasilinear klein - gordon equations with positive mass , where the asymptotics of solutions , hence the function spaces used , are different , namely the leading order term is now decaying ; see section  [ subsecqlkleingordon ] for details .    in section  [ subsecbackward ]",
    "finally , we will discuss backward problems ; it is expected that the results there extend to the setting of einstein s equations ( after fixing a gauge ) on static de sitter and even on kerr - de sitter spacetimes , thus enabling scattering constructions of dynamical black hole spacetimes in the spirit of recent work by dafermos , holzegel and rodnianski @xcite .",
    "while all results were stated for scalar equations , corresponding results hold for operators acting on natural vector bundles , provided that all resonances lie in the unphysical half - plane @xmath45 ( with a simple resonance at @xmath46 being fine as well ) : indeed , the linear arguments go through in general for operators with scalar principal symbols ; only the numerology of the needed regularities depends on estimates of the subprincipal symbol at ( approximate ) radial points .",
    "lastly , let us mention that paradifferential methods would give sharper results with respect to the regularity of the spaces in which we solve equation  , and correspondingly we have not made any efforts here to push the regularity down",
    ". however , our entirely @xmath0-based method is both conceptually and technically relatively straightforward , powerful enough for our purposes , and lends itself very easily to generalizations in other contexts .",
    "non - linear wave and klein - gordon equations on asymptotically de sitter spacetimes ( or static patches thereof ) have been studied in various contexts : friedrich @xcite proved the global non - linear stability of 4-dimensional asymptotically de sitter spaces using a conformal method , see also @xcite for a discussion of more recent developments ; also in four dimensions , rodnianski and speck @xcite proved the stability of the euler - einstein system .",
    "anderson @xcite proved the nonlinear stability of all even - dimensional asymptotically de sitter spaces by generalizing friedrich s argument . on the semilinear level ,",
    "baskin @xcite established strichartz estimates for the linear klein - gordon equation using his parametrix construction @xcite and used them to prove global well - posedness results for classes of semilinear equations with no derivatives ; yagdjian and galstian @xcite derived explicit formulas for the fundamental solution of the klein - gordon equation on exact de sitter spaces , which were subsequently used by yagdjian @xcite to solve semilinear equations with no derivatives .",
    "vasy and the author @xcite proved global well - posedness results for a large class of semilinear wave and klein - gordon equations on ( static ) asymptotically de sitter spaces , where the non - linearity can also involve derivatives ; however , just as in the present paper , the ( b-)microlocal , high regularity approach used does not apply to low - regularity non - linearities covered by the results of baskin and yagdjian .",
    "the study of ps.d.os with non - smooth coefficients has a longer history : beals and reed @xcite developed a partial calculus with coefficients in @xmath0-based sobolev spaces on euclidean space , which is the basis for our extension to manifolds with boundary .",
    "marschall @xcite gave an extension of the calculus to @xmath120-based sobolev spaces ( and even more general spaces ) and in addition proved the invariance of certain classes of non - smooth operators under changes of coordinates .",
    "witt @xcite extended the @xmath0-based calculus to contain elliptic parametrices .",
    "pseudodifferential calculi for coefficients in @xmath121 spaces have been studied by kumano - go and nagase @xcite . in a slightly different direction ,",
    "paradifferential operators , pioneered by bony @xcite and meyer @xcite , are a widely used tool in non - linear pde ; see e.g.  hrmander @xcite and taylor @xcite and the references therein .",
    "we will now give some background on b - pseudodifferential operators and microlocal regularity results along with indications as to how to generalize them to the non - smooth setting , thereby giving a brief , mostly chronological , outline of some of the technical aspects of the paper .",
    "we recall from melrose @xcite that the small calculus of b-ps.d.os on a compact manifold @xmath62 with boundary is the microlocalization of the algebra of b - differential operators on @xmath62 , and the kernels of b-ps.d.os are conceptually best described as conormal distributions on a certain blow - up @xmath122 of @xmath123 , smooth up to the front face , and vanishing to infinite order at the left / right boundary faces .",
    "more prosaically , using local coordinates @xmath124 near the boundary of @xmath62 , i.e.  @xmath125 is a local boundary defining function , and using the corresponding coordinates @xmath126 in the fibers of @xmath127 , i.e.  writing b - covectors as @xmath128 the action of a b - ps.d.o @xmath129 of order @xmath130 on @xmath131 , the dot referring to infinite order of vanishing at the boundary , is computed by @xmath132 where @xmath133 , the full symbol of @xmath134 in the local coordinate chart , lies in the symbol class @xmath135 , i.e.  satisfies the symbolic estimates @xmath136 we say that @xmath134 is a left quantization of @xmath137 . using the formula for the behavior of the full symbol under a coordinate change , one finds that one can invariantly define a _ principal symbol _",
    "@xmath138 of @xmath134 , which is locally just given by ( the equivalence class of ) @xmath137 .",
    "if the principal symbol admits a homogeneous representative @xmath139 , meaning @xmath140 for @xmath141 , then we say that @xmath134 has a _ homogeneous principal symbol _ and , by a slight abuse of notation , set @xmath142 .",
    "we will sometimes identify homogeneous functions on @xmath143 with functions on the unit cosphere bundle @xmath144 , viewed as the boundary of the fiber - radial compactification @xmath145 of @xmath127 . ; in the general case , one should identify homogeneous functions with sections of a natural line bundle on @xmath146 which encodes the differential of a boundary defining function of fiber infinity . ]",
    "the first key point now is that there is a symbolic calculus for b-ps.d.os , with the most important features being that for @xmath147 , @xmath148 where we fixed a b - density on @xmath62 , which in local coordinates is of the form @xmath149 with @xmath150 smooth down to @xmath151 , to define the adjoint . for local computations ,",
    "it is very useful to have the asymptotic expansion @xmath152 for the full symbol of a composition of b-ps.d.os , ' is to be understood in the sense that the difference of the left hand side and the sum on the right hand side , restricted to @xmath153 , lies in @xmath154 , for all @xmath155 . ]",
    "where @xmath137 and @xmath156 are the full symbols of @xmath134 and @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , where @xmath159 .",
    "in particular , this gives that for @xmath160 with principal symbols @xmath161 , the principal symbol of the commutator is @xmath162)=\\frac{1}{i}h_a b$ ] , where @xmath163 this follows from the expansion if we keep track of terms up to first order .",
    "the vector field @xmath164 is in fact the smooth extension to the boundary of the standard hamilton vector field @xmath165 of @xmath166 .",
    "the second key point for us is that b-ps.d.os naturally act on weighted b - sobolev spaces @xmath87 , defined above : @xmath167 we will collect some more information on b - sobolev spaces and b-ps.d.os in section  [ secbfunctionandsymbol ] .    the analogous ` non - smooth ' operators that play the starring role in this paper , b - sobolev b-ps.d.os , are locally defined by , but we now allow the symbol @xmath137 to be less regular . as an example , for many remainder terms in our computations , it will suffice to merely have @xmath168 which already implies that @xmath169 defines a continuous map @xmath170 see proposition  [ propopcont ] .",
    "assuming more regularity of the symbols in @xmath171 , we can study compositions of such non - smooth operators ; the main tool here is the asymptotic expansion , which must be cut off after finitely many terms in view of the limited regularity of the symbols , and the remainder term will be estimated carefully . in section  [ seccalculus ] , we will develop the ( partial ) calculus of b - sobolev b-ps.d.os as far as needed for the remainder of the paper , in particular for the proofs of microlocal regularity results , which will be essential for the linear analysis of equation  .",
    "let us briefly recall a few such regularity results in the smooth setting .",
    "first , we define the _ b - wavefront set _",
    "@xmath172 of @xmath173 as the complement of the set of all @xmath174 such that @xmath175 for some @xmath176 elliptic at @xmath177 ; recall that a b - ps.d.o @xmath176 with homogeneous principal symbol @xmath137 is _ elliptic _ at @xmath174 iff @xmath178 for @xmath141 , where we let @xmath179 act on @xmath143 by dilations in the fiber .",
    "we informally say that @xmath90 is in @xmath50 microlocally at @xmath177 iff @xmath180 . by definition ,",
    "the wavefront set is closed and conic , thus we can view it as a subset of @xmath144 ; moreover , it can capture global @xmath50-regularity in the sense that @xmath181 implies @xmath182 ( and vice versa ) .",
    "_ elliptic regularity _ then states that if @xmath183 satisfies @xmath184 for @xmath185 which is elliptic at @xmath177 , then @xmath90 is in @xmath186 microlocally at @xmath177 .",
    "the proof is an easy application of the symbolic calculus ",
    "one essentially takes the reciprocal of the symbol of @xmath187 near @xmath177 to obtain an approximate inverse of @xmath187 there  and readily generalizes to the non - smooth setting as shown in section  [ secellipticreg ] ; the main technical task is to understand reciprocals of non - smooth symbols , which we will deal with in section  [ sechsrecandcomp ] .",
    "next , given an operator @xmath185 with real homogeneous principal symbol @xmath5 , we need to study the singularities for solutions @xmath183 of @xmath188 within the characteristic set @xmath189 of @xmath90 , microlocally off @xmath190 . ] where we assume @xmath191 at @xmath190 ( so that @xmath190 is a smooth conic codimension @xmath192 submanifold of @xmath143 ) .",
    "the _ real principal type propagation of singularities _ , in the setting of closed manifolds originally due to duistermaat and hrmander @xcite , then states that @xmath193 is invariant under the flow of the hamilton vector field @xmath194 of @xmath5 . in other words",
    ", @xmath193 is the union of maximally extended _ null - bicharacteristics _ of @xmath187 , which are by definition flow lines of @xmath194 .",
    "one proof of this statement uses a positive commutator estimate in the form given by de hoop , uhlmann and vasy @xcite ( see section  [ secpropagation ] for further references ) , which roughly goes as follows : suppose @xmath195 ; we want to propagate microlocal @xmath186-regularity of @xmath90 along a null - bicharacteristic strip @xmath196 of @xmath187 from @xmath177 to a nearby point @xmath197 . to do so",
    ", we choose a symbol @xmath198 with support localized near @xmath196 , which is decreasing along the hamilton flow of @xmath5 except near @xmath177 ( where we have a priori information on @xmath90 ) , i.e.  @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is supported near @xmath177 , and @xmath201 is elliptic near @xmath202 .",

    "let us assume @xmath209 ; then , expanding the commutator and using that @xmath210 , moreover using that @xmath211 is bounded by the regularity assumption on @xmath90 at @xmath177 and @xmath212 is bounded since @xmath90 is in @xmath213 , we obtain @xmath214 .",
    "hence by elliptic regularity , @xmath215 microlocally near @xmath202 , finishing the argument . notice the loss of one derivative compared to the elliptic setting , which naturally comes about by use of a commutator : we can only propagate @xmath186-regularity of @xmath90 , not @xmath216-regularity , even though @xmath217 .",
    "we will generalize this statement to the case of non - smooth @xmath187 in section  [ subsecrealprtype ] by a similar proof . since @xmath187 now only acts on a certain range of b - sobolev spaces , the allowed degrees @xmath218 of regularity that we can propagate have bounds both from above and from below in terms of the regularity @xmath219 of the coefficients of @xmath187 ; also , since non - smooth operators like the ones given by symbols as in have very restricted mapping properties on low or negative order spaces , see  , we need to assume higher regularity @xmath50 of the coefficients of @xmath187 when we want to propagate low regularity @xmath186 of solutions @xmath90 .",
    "the main bookkeeping overhead of the proof of the propagation of singularities thus comes from the need to make sense of all compositions , dual pairings , adjoints and actions of non - smooth operators that appear in the course of the positive commutator argument . on a more technical side",
    ", we will be choosing most operators in the argument ( @xmath220 in the above notation ) to be smooth ones and thus have to absorb certain non - smooth terms into an additional error term @xmath221 of symbolic order @xmath222 , which would render the above argument invalid ; by judiciously choosing @xmath157 and @xmath223 , we can however ensure that the symbol of @xmath221 in fact has a sign , thus the additional term @xmath224 appearing in can be bounded by a version of the sharp grding inequality which we will prove in section  [ subsecsharpgarding ] .    in order to complete the microlocal picture",
    ", we also need to consider the propagation of singularities near _ radial points _ , which are points in the b - cotangent bundle where the hamilton vector field @xmath194 is radial , i.e.  a multiple of the generator of dilations in the fiber .",
    "the above propagation of singularities statement does not give any information at radial points .",
    "now , in many geometrically interesting cases , the hamilton flow near the set of radial points has a lot of structure , e.g.  if the radial set is a set of sources / sinks / saddle points for the flow .",
    "the proof of a microlocal estimate near a class of radial points in section  [ subsecradialpoints ] ( see the introduction to section  [ secpropagation ] for references in the smooth setting ) again proceeds via positive commutators , thus similar comments about the interplay of regularities as in the real principal type setting apply .    in section  [ subsechypotheses ]",
    ", we will combine the microlocal regularity results with standard energy estimates for second order hyperbolic equations from section  [ subsecenergy ] , see e.g.  hrmander ( * ? ? ? * chapter  xxiii ) or @xcite , and prove the existence and higher regularity of global forward solutions to linear wave equations with non - smooth coefficients under certain geometric and dynamical assumptions , in particular non - trapping .",
    "the idea is to start off with forward solutions in a space @xmath225 , @xmath226 , obtain higher regularity at elliptic points , propagate higher regularity ( from the ` past , ' where the solution vanishes ) using the real principal type propagation of singularities , propagate this regularity into radial points , which lie over the boundary , and propagate from there within the boundary ; the non - trapping assumption guarantees that by piecing together all such microlocal regularity statements , we get a global membership in a high regularity b - sobolev space , however still with weight @xmath226 . to improve the decay of the solution",
    ", we use a contour deformation argument using the normal operator family as in @xcite .    finally , to apply the machinery developed thus far to quasilinear wave and klein - gordon equations on ` static ' asymptotically de sitter spaces , we check in section  [ secapp ] that they fit into the framework of section  [ subsechypotheses ] , thereby proving theorems  [ thmintrobaby ] and [ thmintrofull ] . to keep the discussion in section  [ secapp ] simple",
