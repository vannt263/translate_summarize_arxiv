    "thus , in the weyl basis @xmath125 is a diagonal form ( in the dirac basis @xmath111 is diagonal ) .",

    "furthermore , we find that non - magnetic potential ( [ eq : nonmag ] ) and magnetic impurity potentials ( [ eq : mag ] ) are decoupled between the left - handed and the right - handed sectors in the weyl basis .",
    "these results indicate that the present model in the ultra - relativistic limit has a robust feature against non - magnetic impurities associated with the anderson s theorem , irrelevant with the parity .",
