    "in this work , we consider two - user interference channels with an external eavesdropper . without the secrecy constraints , the interference channel is studied extensively in the literature .",
    "however , the capacity region is still not known except for some special cases @xcite .",
    "interference channels with confidential messages is recently studied by  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the external eavesdropper scenario has not been addressed extensively in the literature yet .",
    "in fact , the only relevant work regarding the security of the interference channels with an external eavesdropper is the study of the secure degrees of freedom ( dof ) in the @xmath0-user gaussian interference channels under frequency selective fading models  @xcite , where it is shown that positive secure dofs are achievable for each user in the network .    in this work ,",
    "we propose the cooperative binning and channel prefixing scheme for ( discrete ) memoryless interference channels with an external eavesdropper .",
    "the proposed scheme allows for cooperation in adding randomness to the channel in two ways : @xmath1 ) cooperative binning : the random binning technique of  @xcite is cooperatively exploited at both users .",
    "@xmath2 ) channel prefixing : users exploit the channel prefixing technique of  @xcite in a cooperative manner .",
    "the proposed scheme also utilizes the message - splitting technique of  @xcite and partial decoding of the interfering signals is made possible at the receivers .",
    "the achievable secrecy rate region with the proposed scheme is given .",
    "for the gaussian interference channel , the channel prefixing technique is exploited to inject artificially generated noise samples into the network , where we also allow power control at transmitters to enhance the security of the network .",
    "the proposed scheme is closely related with that of  @xcite.@xcite considered the relay - eavesdropper channel and proposed the noise - forwarding scheme where the relay node sends a codeword from an independently generated codebook to add randomness to the network in order to enhance the security of the main channel .",
    "@xcite considered gaussian multiple - access wire - tap channels and proposed the cooperative jamming scheme in which users transmit their codewords or add randomness to the channel by transmitting noise samples , but not both .",
    "the approach in this sequel , when specialized to the gaussian multiple access channel with an external eavesdropper , generalizes and extends the proposed achievable regions given in  @xcite , due to the implementation of simultaneous cooperative binning and jamming at the transmitters together with more general time - sharing approaches .",
    "this simultaneous transmission of secret messages and noise samples from transmitters is considered by  @xcite . in  @xcite , authors proposed artificially generated noise injection schemes for multi - transmit antenna wire - tap channels , in which the superposition of a secrecy signal and an artificially generated noise is transmitted from the transmitter , where the noisy transmission only degrades the eavesdropper s channel . for the single transmit antenna case , wire - tap channels with helper nodes is considered , in which helper nodes transmit artificially generated noise samples in order to degrade the eavesdropper s channel .",
    "remarkable , exploitation of the channel prefixing technique was transparent in these previous studies .",
    "the proposed scheme in this work shows that the benefit of cooperative jamming scheme of  @xcite and noise injection scheme of  @xcite originates from the channel prefixing technique .",
    "in addition , compared to  @xcite , the proposed scheme allows for cooperation via _ both _ binning and channel prefixing techniques , whereas in  @xcite one of the transmitters is allowed to generate and transmit noise together with the secret signal and cooperation among network users as considered in this sequel was not implemented for the confidential message scenario .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the system model . in section iii",
    ", the main result for discrete memoryless interference channels is given .",
    "section iv is devoted to some examples of the proposed scheme for gaussian channels .",
    "finally , we provide some concluding remarks in section v.",
    "we consider a two - user interference channel with an external eavesdropper ( ic - ee ) , comprised of two transmitter - receiver pairs and an additional eavesdropping node .",
    "the discrete memoryless ic - ee is denoted by @xmath3 for some finite sets @xmath4 . here",
    "the symbols @xmath5 are the channel inputs and the symbols @xmath6 are the channel outputs observed at the decoder @xmath1 , decoder @xmath2 , and at the eavesdropper , respectively .",
    "the channel is memoryless and time - invariant : , where we omit the @xmath7 if @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 . random variables are denoted with capital letters ( @xmath10 ) , and random vectors are denoted as bold - capital letters ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "again , we drop the @xmath7 for @xmath12 .",
    "lastly , @xmath13^+\\triangleq\\max\\{0,x\\}$ ] , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . ]",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 we assume that each transmitter @xmath18 has a secret message @xmath19 which is to be transmitted to the respective receivers in @xmath20 channel uses and to be secured from the external eavesdropper . in this setting , an @xmath21 secret codebook has the following components :    @xmath1 ) the secret message sets @xmath22 for transmitter @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath2 ) encoding function @xmath24 at transmitter @xmath25 which map the secret messages to the transmitted symbols , i.e. , @xmath26 for each @xmath27 for @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath28 ) decoding function @xmath29 at receiver @xmath25 which map the received symbols to estimate of the message : @xmath30 for @xmath23 .",
    "reliability of the transmission of user @xmath25 is measured by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the event that @xmath34 is transmitted from the transmitters .",
    "for the secrecy requirement , the level of ignorance of the eavesdropper with respect to the secured messages is measured by the equivocation rate @xmath35 we say that the rate tuple @xmath36 is achievable for the ic - ee if , for any given @xmath37 , there exists an @xmath38 secret codebook such that , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for sufficiently large @xmath20 .",
    "the secrecy capacity region is the closure of the set of all achievable rate pairs @xmath36 and is denoted as @xmath41 .      the gaussian interference channel in standard form is given in  @xcite .",
    "we have the same transformation here for the gaussian interference channel with an external eavesdropper ( gic - ee ) model .",
    "we remark that the channel capacity will remain the same as the transformations are invertible .",
    "we represent the average power constraints of the transmitters as @xmath42 , where codewords should satisfy @xmath43 for @xmath23 . here the input - output relationship , i.e. , @xmath44 , changes to the following : @xmath45 where @xmath46 for @xmath47 as depicted in fig .",
    "the secrecy capacity region of the gic - ee is denoted as @xmath48 .     for @xmath47 . ]",
    "in this section , we introduce the proposed cooperative binning and channel prefixing scheme for the ic - ee model . with this scheme , transmitters design their secrecy codebooks using the random binning technique  @xcite .",
    "this binning structure in the codebook let a transmitter to add randomness in its own signals . however , the price of adding extra randomness to secure the transmission appear as a rate loss in the achievable rate expressions . in our scenario ,",
    "the proposed strategy allows for cooperation in design of these binning codebooks , and allows for cooperation in prefixing the channel as we utilize the channel prefixing technique of  @xcite at both users .",
    "hence , users of the interference channel will add only _ sufficient _ amount of randomness as the other user will help to increase the randomness seen by the eavesdropper .",
    "the achievable secure rate region with this scheme is described below .",
    "first consider auxiliary random variables @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 defined on arbitrary finite sets @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , respectively .",

    ". here , the variable @xmath49 serves as a time - sharing parameter .",
    "see , for example ,  @xcite for a discussion on time - sharing parameters .",
    "the variable @xmath50 is used to construct the _ common _ secured signal of transmitter @xmath1 that has to be decoded at both receivers , where the random binning technique of  @xcite is used for this construction .",
    "the variable @xmath51 is used to construct the _ self _ secured signal that has to be decoded at receiver @xmath1 but not at receiver @xmath2 , where the random binning technique of  @xcite is used for this construction .",
    "the variable @xmath52 is used to construct _ other _ signal of transmitter @xmath1 that has to be decoded at receiver @xmath2 but not at receiver @xmath1 , where the conventional random codebook construction , see for example  @xcite , is used for this signal , i.e. , no binning is implemented .",
    "similarly , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are utilized at user @xmath2 . finally , it is important to remark that the channel prefixing technique of  @xcite is exploited with this construction as we transformed the channel @xmath44 to @xmath80 using the prefixes @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    to ease the presentation , we first state the following definitions .",
    "we define @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and corresponding rates @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "note that we choose @xmath89 below . also , we define @xmath90 .",

    "@xmath101 is the closure of all @xmath36 satisfying @xmath102 and @xmath103 for a given joint distribution @xmath94 .",
    "we now state the main result of the paper .",
    "the achievable secrecy rate region using the cooperative binning and channel prefixing scheme is as follows .",
    "[ thm : r ] @xmath104 .    the proof is omitted and will be provided in the journal version of this work .",
    "in this section , we provide some examples of the proposed coding scheme for gaussian interference channels and show that the proposed scheme provides gains in securing the network by exploiting cooperative binning , cooperative channel prefixing , and time - sharing techniques .",
    "firstly , we describe how the channel prefixing can be implemented in this gaussian scenario . here",
    ", one can independently generate and transmit noise samples for each channel use from the transmitters ( without constructing a codebook and sending one of its messages ) to enhance the security of the network . as there is no design of a codebook at the interfering user for this noise transmission , receivers and the eavesdropper can only consider this transmission as noise .",
    "accordingly , transmitter @xmath18 uses power @xmath105 for the construction of its ( binning ) codewords , which are explained in the previous section , and obtains , somehow , the signal @xmath106 .",
    "in addition , it uses power @xmath107 for its jamming signal and generates i.i.d .",
    "noise samples represented by @xmath108 , where we choose @xmath109 .",
    "then , it sends @xmath110 to the channel , instead of just sending @xmath111 .",
    "now , we can use the scheme proposed in the previous section for the design of the signals @xmath111 .",
    "below we will use superposition coding to construct this signal . but",
    "first , for a rigorous presentation , we provide some definitions .",
    "let @xmath112 denote the set of all tuples @xmath113 satisfying @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116    now , we define a set of joint distributions @xmath117 as follows .",
    "@xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , where the gaussian model given in ( [ eq : gic - ee ] ) gives @xmath44 .",
    "then , the following region is achievable for the gaussian interference channel with an external eavesdropper .",
    "[ thm : rg ] @xmath130 .",
    "we emphasize the way of implementing the channel prefixing technique of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma @xmath131 ) : @xmath132 is chosen by @xmath133 . with this choice , we are able to implement simultaneous binning and jamming at the transmitters together with a power control .",
    "we now present a computationally simpler region .",
    "consider @xmath135    [ thm : rg2 ] @xmath136 @xmath137 .",
    "we also provide a sub - region of @xmath138 that will be used for numerical results .",
    "define a set of joint distributions @xmath139 .",
    "@xmath140    [ thm : rg3 ] @xmath141 @xmath137 .",
    "it is important to note that we use the convex closure of the rate regions instead of using a time - sharing parameter in these subregions .",
    "we have already given the more general region above and we conjecture that it is possible to extend these achievable subregions by a different choice of channel prefixing or by using a time - sharing approach .",
    "accordingly , we consider a tdma - like approach , which will show that even a simple type of time - sharing is beneficial . here",
    "we divide the @xmath20 channel uses into two intervals of lengths represented by @xmath142 and @xmath143 , where @xmath144 and @xmath142 is assumed to be an integer . the first period , of length @xmath142 , is dedicated to secure transmission for user @xmath1 .",
    "during this time , transmitter @xmath1 generates binning codewords using power @xmath145 and jams the channel using power @xmath146 ; and transmitter @xmath2 jams the channel using power @xmath147 . for the second period",
    "the roles of the users are reversed , where users use powers @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "we call this scheme cooperative tdma ( c - tdma ) and obtain the following region in this case .",
    "[ thm : rc - tdma ] @xmath151 , where @xmath152 @xmath153 where @xmath154^+,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath155^+.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that , we only consider adding randomness by noise injection for the cooperative tdma scheme above . however , our coding scheme presented in the previous section allows for an implementation of more general cooperation strategies , in which users can add randomness to the channel in two ways : adding randomness via cooperative binning and adding randomnees via cooperative channel prefixing .",
    "a user by implementing _ both _ of these approaches can help the other one in a time - division setting .",
    "we again remark that the proposed cooperative binning and channel prefixing scheme allows even more general approaches such as having more than two time - sharing periods .      in this section",
    "we provide numerical results for the following subregions of the achievable region given by corollary  [ thm : rg ] .",
    "@xmath1 ) @xmath156 : this region is provided above , where we utilize both cooperative binning and channel prefixing .",
    "@xmath2 ) @xmath157 : here we utilize either cooperative binning or channel prefixing scheme at a transmitter , but not both .",
    "@xmath28 ) @xmath158 : here we only utilize cooperative binning . accordingly , jamming powers are set to zero .",
    "@xmath131 ) @xmath159 : this region is an example of utilizing both time - sharing and cooperative channel prefixing . no cooperative binning is used .",
    "@xmath160 ) @xmath161 : here we do not allow transmitters to jam the channel during their dedicated time slots and call this case no self channel prefixing ( nscp ) .",
    "@xmath162 ) @xmath163 : here no channel prefixing is implemented .",
    "this case refers to conventional tdma scheme , in which users are allowed to transmit during only their assigned slots .",
    "hence , this scheme only utilizes time - sharing .",
    "numerical results are provided in fig .",
    "@xmath2 and fig .",
    "the first scenario depicted in fig .",
    "@xmath2 shows the benefits of cooperative binning technique .",
    "also , cooperative channel prefixing does not help to enlarge the secure rate region in this scenario .",
    "secondly , in fig .",
    "@xmath28 , we consider an asymmetric scenario , in which the first user has a weak channel to the eavesdropper but the second user has a strong channel to the eavesdropper . here , the second user can help the first one to increase its secrecy rate .",
    "however , channel prefixing and time - sharing does not help to the second user as it can not achieve positive secure rate without an implementation of cooperative binning .",
    "remarkable , cooperative binning technique helps the second user to achieve positive secure transmission rate in this case .",
    "these observations suggest the implementation of all three techniques ( cooperative binning , cooperative channel prefixing , and time - sharing ) as considered in our general rate region , i.e. , @xmath134 .    , @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "]    , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath165 . ]",
    "it can be shown that the proposed scheme reduces to the noise forwarding scheme of  @xcite for the discrete memoryless relay - eavesdropper channel .",
    "remarkable , the channel prefixing technique can be exploited in this scenario to increase the achievable secure rates .",
    "for example , for the gaussian channel , injecting i.i.d .",
    "noise samples can increase the achievable secure transmission rates as shown in  @xcite .",
    "our result here shows that the gain resulting from the noise injection comes from the exploitation of the channel prefixing technique .",
    "in addition , the proposed scheme , when specialized to a gaussian multiple - access scenario , results in an achievable region that generalizes and extends the proposed regions given in  @xcite due to the implementation of simultaneous cooperative binning and channel prefixing at the transmitters together with more general time - sharing approaches .",
