    "strong constraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution have been provided by observational studies of the physical properties of low - luminous and low surface - brightness dwarf spheroidal and irregular galaxies in the field and in clusters ( e.g. , ferguson & binggeli 1994 ; mateo 1998 ) . in detail , these studies have addressed such observables as the scaling relation ( kormendy 1977 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) , the luminosity function ( binggeli , sandage , & tammann 1985 ; sandage , binggeli , & tammann 1985 ) , the presence of nuclear structures ( binggeli & cameron 1991 ) , and rotation - curve profiles ( moore 1994 ) . a new type of sub - luminous and extremely compact `` dwarf galaxy '' has been recently discovered in an ` all - object ' spectroscopic survey centred on the fornax cluster ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2000a , b ) .",
    "these have been already identified as bright compact objects ( hilker et al .",
    "1999 ) and very luminous globular clusters around cd galaxies ( harris , pritchet , & mcclure 1995 ) . these `` dwarf galaxies '' , which are members of the fornax cluster , have intrinsic sizes of @xmath0 100 pc and absolute @xmath1 band magnitude ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 mag and are thus called `` ultra - compact dwarf '' ( ucd ) galaxies .",
    "the luminosities of ucds are intermediate between those of globular clusters and small dwarf galaxies and are similar to those of the bright end of the luminosity function of the nuclei of nucleated dwarf ellipticals .",
    "these ucds are observed to be within 30 arcminutes of the central dominant galaxy in fornax , ngc  1399 , and are distributed at larger radii than this galaxy s globular cluster system .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to suggest one possible origin for these newly discovered enigmatic ucds .",
    "we adopt here the scenario that ucds are the stripped nuclei of dwarf galaxies and thereby investigate numerically how nucleated dwarf spheroidal galaxies evolve dynamically under the strong tidal field of ngc  1399 .",
    "a growing number of evidences supporting this scenario have been accumulating for the case of @xmath6cen and m54 ( e.g. , majewski et al . 1999 ; layden & sarajedini 2000 ; van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "we here demonstrate : ( 1)how a ucd is formed when a nucleated dwarf galaxy is subjected to the strong tidal field of a massive galaxy such as ngc  1399 , and ( 2)in what physical conditions this process of nucleated dwarf galaxy @xmath7 ucd formation can take place .",
    "the importance of the tidal field of more massive galaxies in forming globular clusters ( and even objects that are an order of magnitude brighter than globular clusters ) from nucleated dwarf galaxies has already been discussed by several authors ( e.g. , zinnecker et al .",
    "1988 ; freeman 1993 ; bassino et al .",
    "extraction of @xmath8 galactic nuclei from less massive galaxies by the tidal effects of more massive ones is suggested to be important in a variety of different contexts , such as the evolution of m32 and the formation of galactic halo globular clusters ( bekki et al .",
    "we can think of and refer to this tidal effect as `` galaxy threshing '' .",
    "we consider a collisionless stellar system with a mass and size similar to that of nucleated dwarf galaxies , orbiting a massive elliptical galaxy ( eg . , ngc  1399 ) which is embedded within a massive dark matter halo . to give our model a realistic radial density profile for the ngc  1399 dark matter halo",
    ", we base it on both the x - ray observational results of jones et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and the predictions from the standard cold dark matter cosmogony ( navarro , frenk , & white 1996 ) .",
    "the total mass of ngc  1399 within 125 kpc ( represented by m@xmath9 ) and the scale length of the halo are assumed to be @xmath10 and 43.5 kpc , respectively . by using two plummer models (",
    "binney & tremaine 1987 ) with rather different scale lengths , we construct a model for nucleated dwarf galaxies as follows : first , we place a smaller spherical stellar system having a plummer density profile with scale length @xmath11 and mass m@xmath12 in the center of a larger spherical system with a plummer profile of scale length @xmath13 and mass m@xmath14 ( @xmath13 @xmath15 @xmath11 and m@xmath14 @xmath15 m@xmath12 ) .",
    "second , in order to get the model to reach a new dynamical equilibrium , we run the simulation of the dynamical evolution in the nested plummer models for 10 dynamical time scales .",
    "finally , we use the stellar system as the model for a nucleated dwarf galaxy . from now on , the outer ( more massive ) diffuse stellar component and the inner ( less massive ) compact one are referred to as the ` envelope ' and ` nucleus ' , respectively .",
    "the mass ( luminosity ) and the scale length of a dwarf is modeled according to the observed scaling relation of ferguson & binggeli ( 1994 ) : @xmath16 = -0.2 m_{\\rm b } - 0.3 $ ] for bright dwarfs ( @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 ) and @xmath16 = -0.02 m_{\\rm b } + 2.6 $ ] for faint ones ( @xmath17 @xmath20 @xmath19 ) , where @xmath21 and @xmath17 are the scale length of the exponential profile and @xmath1 band absolute magnitude , respectively . by assuming that @xmath13 = @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( the ratio of total stellar mass to total @xmath1 band luminosity ) = 1.0 corresponding to the observed value of the dwarf galaxy ddo 154 ( carignan & beaulieu 1989 ) , we determine @xmath13 from the total mass ( @xmath24 ) of the model . since the nuclei typically contributes about 2% of the total light of dwarfs ( binggeli & cameron 1991 ; freeman 1993 )",
    ", we assume that @xmath25 = 0.02 for all models .",
    "considering the fact that the central light excess with respect to the adopted model profile is observed to vary between nucleated dwarfs ( e.g. , binggeli & cameron 1991 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) , we take the scale length ratio @xmath26 of the nested plummer models to be a free parameter .",
    "we investigate nucleated dwarf models in the luminosity range @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath17 @xmath28 @xmath29 and with @xmath26 ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 .",
    "the orbit of a nucleated dwarf is assumed to be influenced only by the gravitational potential resulting from the dark halo component of ngc  1399 .",
    "the center of ngc  1399 is always set to be ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) = ( 0,0 ) whereas the initial position and velocity of a dwarf are ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) = ( @xmath32,0 ) and ( @xmath33,@xmath34 ) = ( 0,@xmath35 ) , respectively . by changing these two parameters @xmath32 and @xmath35",
    ", we investigate how the transformation process from dwarfs into ucds depends on their orbits .",
    "although we have investigated models with a variety of different @xmath36 , @xmath13 , @xmath32 , and @xmath35 values , we mainly describe here the results of a ` standard ' model with total mass of m@xmath14 + m@xmath12 = 2.0 @xmath37 @xmath4 m@xmath38 , @xmath13 = 7.94 @xmath37 @xmath39 pc , @xmath11 = 79.4 pc , @xmath32 = 200 kpc , and @xmath35 = 1.29 @xmath37 @xmath39 km @xmath40 .",
    "figure 1 shows the orbit with respect to ngc  1399 and the final mass distribution for the simulated dwarf galaxy in the standard model .    in the following ,",
    "our units of mass , length , and time are 2.0 @xmath37 @xmath4 m@xmath38 ( corresponding to m@xmath14 + m@xmath41 in the standard model ) , 7.94 @xmath37 @xmath39 pc ( @xmath13 ) , and 2.36 @xmath37 @xmath42 yr ( dynamical time scale ) , respectively .",
    "parameter values and final morphologies for each model are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the sixth and the seventh columns give orbital eccentricity ( @xmath43 ) and pericenter distance ( @xmath44 ) , respectively , for each model .",
    "the eighth column describes the final morphological properties after 160 time units ( corresponding to 3.8 gyr ) : ` ucd ' indicates a remnant with the envelope completely stripped yet the nucleus largely unaffected , ` de , n ' the case where both the envelope and nucleus survive , and ` no remnant ' where both components are tidally stripped .",
    "all the simulations have been carried out on a grape board ( sugimoto et al . 1990 ) in which energy and angular momentum are conserved within 1 % accuracy .",
    "the total number of particles used for each model and the gravitational softening length adopted for its envelope(nucleus ) were 10,000 ( 5000 ) and 0.47 ( 0.06 ) in our units , respectively .",
    "as the dwarf approaches the pericenter of its orbit for the first time ( @xmath45 = 20 ) , the strong tidal field of ngc  1399 stretches the envelope along the direction of the dwarf s orbit and consequently tidally strips the stars of the envelope ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "since the envelope loses a significant fraction of its mass after the first passage of the pericenter , the envelope becomes more susceptible to the tidal effects of ngc  1399 .",
    "as the dwarf again approaches the pericenter ( @xmath45 @xmath0 50 and 90 ) , the envelope again loses a large number of its stars owing to tidal stripping and consequently becomes less massive and more diffuse . after four passages of the pericenter , the dwarf loses its envelope almost entirely .",
    "the central nucleus , on the other hand , is just weakly influenced by the tidal force owing to its compact configuration during the tidal destruction of the envelope .",
    "thanks to its strongly self - gravitating nature , the nucleus loses only a small amount ( @xmath0 18 % ) of mass and thus can keep its compact morphology during its tidal interaction with ngc  1399 .",
    "figure 3 shows that a significant fraction of the envelope of the dwarf is tidally stripped every time it passes through the inner part of ngc  1399 ( e.g. , 63 % between @xmath45 = 25 and 60 ) . as a result of this , nearly all ( 98% ) of the stars within the dwarf s envelope [ radius @xmath46 ( = 0.8kpc ) ]",
    "are removed within four passages of its pericenter ( corresponding to 3.8 @xmath37 @xmath47 yr ) .",
    "the temporal increase of the envelope mass within @xmath13 around the apocenter is due to the fact that a significant fraction of stripped stars pass through the surrounds of the dwarf .",
    "the ratio of the nuclear mass to the total mass is dramatically changed from 0.08 ( 0.85 ) to 0.83 ( 1.0 ) for @xmath48 @xmath28 @xmath13 ( @xmath48 @xmath28 0.1@xmath13 ) , which implies that the final remnant after `` threshing '' is nearly fully self - gravitating .",
    "thus a ucd of size @xmath0 100 pc and mass @xmath49 m@xmath38 ( corresponding to @xmath17 = @xmath50 mag for m@xmath51 = 1.0 ) is formed from the tidal interaction between a nucleated dwarf and ngc  1399 .",
    "it is clear from figures 2 and 3 that before the formation of a ucd is completed , a compact nucleus with a considerably diffuse outer envelope is seen ( e.g. , @xmath45 = 100 ) .",
    "this suggests the existence of extremely diffuse nucleated dwarf galaxies , formed in this intermediate stage of the de , n@xmath7ucd conversion process . as is shown in figure 4 , the remnant shows a rather compact density distribution because of it being composed mostly of the self - gravitating nucleus at @xmath45 = 160 .",
    "four important parameter dependences in the formation of ucds were found as follows ( see the table 1 ) : for the model in which the nucleus of the dwarf is not so compact ( @xmath26 @xmath0 0.5 ; model 2 ) , both the nuclear and envelope components disintegrate under the influence of the tidal field and , accordingly , no remnant is left .",
    "a ucd is not formed in model 3 with larger values of @xmath32 ( 200 kpc ) and @xmath44 ( 95 kpc ) , but a smaller ellipticity ( @xmath52 ) , whereas one is in model 4 with a smaller @xmath32 ( 100kpc ) and a smaller @xmath43 ( 0.34 ) .",
    "this suggests that nucleated dwarfs with either a smaller @xmath44 ( or smaller @xmath43 ) or smaller @xmath32 , are more likely to be transformed into a ucd and thus ucds should show a centrally concentrated spatial distribution around ngc  1399 .",
    "thirdly , the formation of a ucd seems to have no dependence on the mass of the nucleated dwarf s envelope , m@xmath14 , as shown by models 1 , 5 - 7 .",
    "irrespective of the masses of these models with @xmath43 = 0.81 and @xmath44 = 21 kpc , ucds are formed by `` galaxy threshing '' .",
    "this indicates that ucds observed to have different masses were previously the nuclei of nucleated dwarfs with different masses . finally , for the model with a rather small mass for ngc  1399 ( model 8) , disintegration of the simulated nucleated dwarf does not occur at all , even if @xmath44 is small",
    "this suggests that ucds are formed only in the surrounds of massive galaxies .    several observational properties of nucleated dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , freeman 1993 ) and numerical simulations ( bassino et al .",
    "1994 ) suggest that globular clusters are the stripped nuclei of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we have confirmed the `` disintegration scenario '' ( bassino et al .",
    "1994 ) in which ucds ( @xmath2 @xmath28 @xmath17 @xmath28 @xmath3 mag ) , which are more than an order of magnitude brighter than the galactic globular clusters , were also previously nuclei of more massive dwarf galaxies ( m@xmath14 @xmath0 @xmath4 m@xmath38 ) orbiting ngc  1399 .",
    "accordingly , it is likely that physical properties of ucds such as the luminosity - size relation and stellar content are more like those of globular clusters than those of dwarf spheroidal / elliptical galaxies : it might not be correct to call the observed compact objects around ngc  1399 `` dwarf galaxies '' .",
    "our numerical simulations with variously different parameters revealed that not all of nucleated dwarfs can be transformed into ucds by `` galaxy threshing '' ( e.g. , for the case of the smaller ratio of the dwarf mass to the giant mass ) , which suggests that the number ratio of ucds to nucleated dwarfs is different between different environments .",
    "the present study provides the following two implications as to the nature of ucds .",
    "first , the stellar populations of ucds are unlikely to be young even if the precursor nuclei of dwarf galaxies have obviously young populations .",
    "this is essentially because more than a few gyrs , which is enough for young stars to become intermediate - age populations due to aging , are necessary for `` galaxy threshing '' to transform a nucleated dwarf into an ucd .",
    "second , the ucd luminosity function is not necessarily similar to that of the nuclei of nucleated dwarf galaxies , because `` galaxy threshing '' is a selective process : extraction of the nucleus depends strongly on the orbits and masses of the dwarfs . since these physical properties can be directly observed in future observations",
    " not only in the fornax cluster but also in other nearby clusters such as coma and virgo  they will provide a critical test of the viability of the `` threshing '' scenario for ucd formation .",
