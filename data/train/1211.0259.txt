    "defining urban form is certainly an important and difficult issue , especially if one wants to supply useful knowledge to urban planners and urban designers or new knowledge for city scientist . in this paper",
    "we address this question , and we try to improve the empirical - based knowledge on the structure of a city by studying the urban street networks of ten european cities , namely edinburgh , leicester , sheffield , oxford , worcester , lancaster , catania , barcelona , bologna and geneva .",
    "the form of cities is the subject of an area of urban studies named urban morphology .",
    "urban morphology in its current form emerged between the 40s and the 60s of the xx century from the work of two scholars as prominent as different : the german - born and then british urban geographer m.r.conzen ( 1960 ) , and the italian architect and historian saverio muratori ( 1960 ) . in this area , the main subject of investigation is the urban fabric of the city at the scale of the neighborhood , street , plot and building .",
    "a different branch of urban morphology has stemmed from the sciences of complex systems building on a long standing tradition in regional analysis , economic geography and modeling @xcite .",
    "complexity in the built environment is here investigated with the same instruments used for other classes of self - organized phenomena in nature , technology and society @xcite .",
    "these works are now flanked by a growing interest on complex spatial networks within the community of physics @xcite .",
    "spatial networks and in particular planar graphs are suited to model a number of real phenomena @xcite .",
    "we are here interested in the study of a particular class of spatial networks that describe the street pattern of cities .",
    "the beginning of these studies can be traced back to the classical works on regional transportation networks based on graph theory @xcite .",
    "the advent of complex system science and its paradigm @xcite , jointly with the increasing availability of spatial and time geo - referenced data , has given a new boost to these studies , and several important contributions have appeared recently @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , masucci _ et al . _ study the structural property of the london street network in its dual and primal representation . in @xcite , the autors , by using 40 urban networks in a dual representation , found a small - world structure and a scale - free property for both street length and connectivity degree , and used various centrality indices as indicators of the importance of streets .",
    "et al . _ developed a comparative analysis of the betweenness distribution in 20 cities in germany , suggesting a relation with vehicular traffic @xcite .",
    "others have focused on centralities in primal and dual representations of street networks @xcite , and on other structural features , such as the number of cycles of a given length @xcite .",
    "however , an important and still open question in urban morphology has to do with the characterization of classes of cities based on their form .",
    "this is a preliminary step to approach a comparative analysis aimed at the classification of cities . in this paper",
    "we propose a classification based on the distribution of street centrality by cross - comparing real cases and therefore with no use of null models .",
    "we limit our study to the characterization of city form without exploring its impact on collective behaviors , an area of research which , at the scale of entire cities , is now finding new opportunities through the exploitation of massive datasets from online geo - social networks and mobile geo - referenced systems @xcite    in our study , we first observe the geometry of the networks following the approach recently suggested in @xcite ; we consider the distribution of basic indices of the primal street networks such as street angles at intersections and street lengths .",
    "secondly , we investigate four different centralities indices computed over the entire urban street network , highlighting their distribution and their mutual correlation .",
    "we considered 10 european cities namely edinburgh , leicester , sheffield , oxford , worcester , lancaster , catania , barcelona , bologna and geneva .",
    "we show that these cities share some structural geometric properties , which are the same found in other planar spatial systems such as those of leaves @xcite , which suggests that planarity in itself is a driver across spatial systems in various domains .",
    "however , we also show that cities are different .",
    "we witness that some cities , like catania , stand alone in terms of basic geometric properties and , more importantly , that the various distributions of centrality are reconcilable to one common pattern ( a power law ) only if a largely minoritarian subset of streets are taken into consideration .",
    "these results have to do with the extreme heterogeneity of the cities visible traits as resulting from the interplay of entirely different phenomenon in time , such as historical accidents ( including planning ) , physical constraints or just random events @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show how cases tend to cluster in groups after the whole set of centrality measures distributions are considered in a way that suggests major planning interventions and physical geographic constraints are key .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : basicprops ]",
    "the case studies are presented and their geometric properties are introduced and analyzed . in section  [",
    "s : centralities ] the study of the four centrality indices is illustrated along with the clusterization of cases according to their combined behavior as a result of the application of a principal component analysis ( pca ) of the distribution of those four centralities .",
    "finally in section  [ s : discussion ] we offer a discussion of the results and our conclusions .",
    "we address the analysis of 10 european cities , namely : edinburgh , leicester , sheffield , oxford , worcester and lancaster ( uk ) ; catania and bologna ( it ) ; barcelona ( es ) ; geneva ( ch ) ( fig .",
    "[ f : map ] ) . these cities are variously located and present remarkably different economic , cultural and climatic conditions along with great variety of characteristics like population and size ( tab .",
    "[ t : ppts ] ) .",
    "we represent the street network of these cities such that intersections are nodes and streets are links between nodes , i.e. a primal representation @xcite .",
    "we analyse such networks in terms of their basic properties and several geometric indices such as street length and the angle they form at intersections .        before getting deeper into the analysis ,",
    "we introduce some basic concepts of graph theory . a graph ( or network )",
    "is a mathematical object which consists of two sets : @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath2 elements of the former are called _ nodes _ , while the @xmath3 elements of the latter ( unordered couple of nodes ) are called _ links_. + there are many ways to represent a graph , but , the most common one is the _ adjacency matrix _ @xmath4 , a @xmath5 square matrix whose entry @xmath6 is equal to one if link between nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 exists and zero otherwise .",
    "the _ degree _ of a node @xmath7 , @xmath9 , is the number of links incident with it .",
    "the _ average degree _",
    "@xmath10 , is nothing but the average of the degrees over all the nodes in the network .",
    "networks of street patterns belong to a particular class of graphs called , _ planar graph _ , i.e. graphs whose links cross only on nodes . in our case ,",
    "the nodes represent street intersections , while the links are the streets centerline , a network made using this convention is called _ primal network _ ( fig .",
    "[ f : nets ] ) .",
    "our networks are also weighted and each link ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) carries a numerical value @xmath11 expressing the intensity of the connection . the natural choice , in our case , for the functional form expressing the weight of a link connecting nodes , say @xmath7 and @xmath8 , is to put @xmath11 equal to the length of the street connecting , @xmath12 .",
    "our analysis starts by importing the street system into a geographical information system ( gis ) environment .",
    "data of the street systems have been retrieved from different sources : for example , in all uk cases we have used the ordnance survey maps , while in italian cases we have used data from city councils planning offices , and in barcelona we worked on a dataset provided by the agncia decologia urbana de barcelona .",
    "given that these geographical street networks had been mainly built for the sake of traffic navigation or planning , they presented characteristics that not always fitted the purposes of a centrality analysis ; for example , multi - lane streets were usually represented with one link per lane rather than one link per street . as a result",
    "we have prepared our databases by first cleaning the networks accurately to remove link redundancies , fix short missing links , collapse unconnected links on the same node when needed , continuously confronting the networks with aerial images of the real cities drawn from remote sensing sources such as google earth .",
    "such procedure was undertaken both manually and through ad - hoc tools in a gis environment .",
    "for the definition of the boundary of the urban systems , we followed the border of the built - up area extending it by roughly 1 km outbound .    considering the entries of tab .",
    "[ t : ppts ] , we can see how various selected cities are for example in terms of size , from small cases like lancaster to large ones like barcelona , or in terms of street intersection density , from very dense cities like catania to more sprawled ones like edinburgh .",
    "we have selected cities with different levels of geographic constraints , from those like geneva and oxford traversed or limited by large natural water features to those like catania and bologna that sit on uninterrupted plains , and a different prominence of planning history , from those self - organized or only fragmentarily planned like leicester or bologna to one like barcelona whose street layout had been heavily determined by one single planning vision ( the 1859 cerd plan ) .",
    "we see that the particular planning history of barcelona is reflected in the low values of both the standard deviation of the street length and the percentage of dead - end streets on the total number of streets , both resulting from the extensive adoption of a rigid homogeneous grid layout .",
    "the extreme diversity of selected cases has been pursued in order to make the comparative analysis of similarities and differences more profound .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     streets are not always straight lines . in order to study the distribution of angles formed by streets at intersections",
    "we must use an equivalent network in which all the streets are represented by straight lines ( i.e. substituting the curved streets with straight ones ) and where the link weight is equal to the euclidean distance between its end nodes .",
    "we name this network _",
    "euclidean network_. as for all the generalization models , results should be interpreted with caution because of the effect that the approximation may produce on the real structure of the network . such caution suggests a preliminary test .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ f : angles ] shows small divergences between the distribution of street length in the original and the euclidean networks for the city of leicester . such simple",
    "test confirms that the euclidean generalization does not lose relevant information , i.e. that streets in cities are not always straight , but predominantly so , confirming the finding provided in @xcite .",
    "therefore we are confident to study the distribution of the angles formed by street intersections in the euclidean network as a reliable approximation of the original .",
    "the distributions of the angles formed by streets at intersections are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : angles ] . at a glance",
    ", we note that all the cities share the same behavior exhibiting a double peak shaped distribution around the characteristic values of 90 and 180 degrees , respectively .",
    "this finding confirms the analogous results that have been found in other kinds of spatial planar networks , like those of leaf venations @xcite , as a result of tensorial stress fields or simple force models .        the incidence of certain motifs in complex networks is a long standing object of investigation , @xcite .",
    "here we want to focus not on the cycle s shape and quantity , but on the relation between the total length of dead links within a given cycle and its area .",
    "even if we are measuring static systems , i.e. systems that do not change in time , we should remember that a cycle is the result of an evolutionary process that starts with short dead end streets sprouting from the longest edges of the cycles and then extending towards the opposite edge until splitting the original cycle in two smaller sub - cycles .",
    "dead end streets can be interpreted as sprouts of new cycles in parcels still subjected to evolution or as crystallized fractures that do not undergo further development .",
    "their quantity is given by the index @xmath13 shown in tab .",
    "[ t : ppts ] and it can be thought of as an estimator of the abundance of cycles in the intermediate evolutionary stage of their lifetime as suggested in @xcite .",
    "such assumptions are supported by the result shown in fig .",
    "[ f : deadends ] , where we report the sum of the length of dead links inside each cycle versus the area of the cycle itself for each city .",
    "the distribution shows a clear power - law behavior with a common exponent close to 0.8 .",
    "it is worth to note that the power - law behavior is not affected by any factor like the fraction of dead ends @xmath13 , or the average degree @xmath14 .",
    "similar results have appeared in @xcite .",
    "of course , our findings can be truly confirmed only by investigating the evolution of urban streets in time with the support of empirical data .",
    "the concept of centrality has been used for many years in network and social science and , starting from the seminal work by wasserman @xcite , there has been a growth of literature both regarding centrality on social networks as well as other kinds of networks .",
    "depending on the definition , centrality can be understood as meaning proximity between nodes , accessibility from other nodes , or being in a strategic position for connecting couple of nodes .",
    "it is clear that from different definitions of centrality , a node actor can be placed at different centrality ranks and that the same node can result with high value for a centrality while yielding weak values for another one .",
    "therefore , for different cities , we can reasonably expect slightly different distributions of centralities .",
    "moreover , we can identify how centralities are mutually dependent and correlated .",
    "what makes centralities particularly suited for geographical studies is that they can be visualized and mapped .",
    "we are interested in understanding if and how these ranges of correlations and fluctuation can help to classify cities that share the main network morphology .",
    "for example , a grid - like network can be different from a radial one , but only looking at the statistical distribution of centralities might not be enough for a proper classification .",
    "this problem has been already analysed by crucitti and porta @xcite where the statistical distribution of closeness , betweenness , straightness and information centralities have been analysed for a sample of twenty city parcels of one square mile .",
    "_ found significant differences between cities and through a cluster analysis they proposed a classification of different urban patterns .",
    "the approach proved to be effective in capturing essential features of urban form as emerging in limited samples selected for their inner morphological consistency , but dealing with entire cities poses the problem of the classification of internally complex objects predominantly composed of different parts each possibly exhibiting different properties .",
    "so , the question about the validity of such a procedure on a whole city still need a response . in order to validate",
    "if centrality indices can be used in the classification of entire cities , we propose here a clustering method based on the principal component analysis ( pca ) made on the distribution of centralities and on their moments . before discussing this part of the research",
    ", we must introduce briefly the adopted centrality indices .",
    "* betweenness centrality * , @xmath15 , is based on the idea that a node is more central when it is traversed by a larger number of the shortest paths connecting all couple of nodes in the network . more precisely , the betweenness of a node @xmath7 is defined as in @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of shortest paths connecting @xmath8 and @xmath18 , while @xmath19 is the number of shortest paths connecting @xmath8 and @xmath18 and passing through @xmath7 .",
    "* straightness centrality * , @xmath20 , originates from the idea that the efficiency in the communication between two nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 is equal to the inverse of the shortest path length , or geodesic , @xmath21 @xcite . in the case of a spatial network embedded into a euclidean space",
    ", the straightness centrality of node @xmath7 is defined as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the euclidean distance between nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 along a straight line .",
    "this measurement captures to which extent the connecting route between nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , let s say between each street junctions , deviates from a virtual straight route .",
    "the * closeness centrality * , @xmath24,of a node @xmath7 is based on the concept of minimum distance , in topological sense , i.e. the minimum number of edges traversed to get from @xmath7 to @xmath8 + @xcite and is defined as in @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the average distance from @xmath7 to all the other nodes .",
    "closeness centrality is a classical centrality index that has been widely used in urban geography and econometrics as well as in regional planning , where it gives an idea of the cost that spatial distance loads on many different kinds of relationships that take place between places , people , activities and markets .",
    "the * accessibility * @xmath27 is a measure recently introduced by travenolo and costa + @xcite .",
    "it has been used for studying the property of very different spatial networks . in the case of urban networks",
    ", it has been used to investigate the relationship between subway and road systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , the accessibility has been found to be closely related to the borders of networks @xcite , in the sense that nodes with low accessibility tend to belong to these borders .",
    "the @xmath27 of node @xmath7 measures the ratio of neighbouring nodes that are effectively reached by an agent randomly navigating the network against the actual number of nodes that belong to the neighborhood .",
    "more precisely , @xmath27 takes into account the number of nodes effectively accessed by each node of the network , as well as the probabilities of such accesses .",
    "first , we evaluate the transition probability @xmath28 which describes the probability for an agent leaving from node @xmath7 to reach node @xmath8 after @xmath29 steps along a given type of walk . at each step",
    ", the agent located at node @xmath30 , chooses a random neighbor of @xmath30 and jump to it .",
    "these rules define a random walk over the network .",
    "when the transition probabilities are very heterogeneous , we have low values of accessibility , meaning that the random walks are biased toward a certain number of nodes , which is , less than the number of nodes which can be reached after @xmath29 steps . on the other hand , when the transition probabilities are homogeneous , all nodes which can be reached after @xmath29 steps are accessed , on average , the same number of times .",
    "this case corresponds to the highest values of accessibility .",
    "the heterogeneity of the transition probabilities is quantified in terms of the classical concept of entropy , so that the mathematical definition of accessibility , of a node @xmath7 , with respect to the number of steps @xmath29 is given as    @xmath31,\\ ] ]    also , we have considered the transition probability for unitary step @xmath32 , as :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the weight of the edge @xmath35 . in order to take the geography into account",
    ", we considered @xmath36 .",
    "for disconnected nodes , we assume @xmath37 such that @xmath38 .    in order to investigate",
    "if the distribution of centralities can describe the main geographical differences within cities , we use the pca approach .",
    "this well - established method of multivariate statistics implements a projection of the distribution of objects ( in our case , cities ) from a higher into a lower dimensional space such that the maximum dispersion of the data is observed at the first new axis ( or principal variable ) , and so forth .",
    "this projection is optimal in the sense of fully decorrelating the original data , therefore removing all correlations between the original measurements describing the objects .",
    "so , since the data dispersion is better described by the first principal axes , the remainder axes can be discarded .",
    "pca is therefore particularly relevant to the presents studies because : ( i ) it decorrelates the original measurements ; ( ii ) it provides a projection of the data that maximizes their dispersion ( i.e. the differences between the cities ) ; and ( iii ) it allows the visualization of the distribution of objects ( when projected into 2d or 3d spaces ) .",
    "the pca consists in obtaining the covariance matrix of the original data and then extracting its eigenvalues and respective eigenvectors .",
    "the eigenvalues can be shown to correspond to the variances along each new axis , and the each respective eigenvector component provides the coefficient of the linear combination of the original measurements used to project the original data into the respective axis .",
    "therefore , the effectiveness of pca in projecting the data can be inferred by inspecting the eigenvalues in descending order .",
    "for instance , if the two largest eigenvalues account for 75% of the overall variance , it can be understood that these two axes are describing the original distribution of points in an effective way , and that the other axes can be overlooked without losing much information .",
    "first , we evaluate the histogram of each centrality measurement considering 20 bins . in this way",
    ", each dimension corresponds to the relative frequency of centrality values in a small range .",
    "the histogram of each one of the four centralities were merger together in order to create an eighty dimension feature vector for each city .",
    "for instance , figure  [ f : pcacontrib ] ( top ) shows the feature vector obtained for the city of leicester .",
    ", width=302 ]    in the second approach , the feature vectors were created by considering the 20th first moments of the centralities distributions merged together , also generating an eighty dimension vector .",
    "it is important to note that , both first and second approaches provided similar results .",
    "finally , the dimension of the feature vectors were reduced from eighty to two , in which each original dimension has contribution according the values shown in figure  [ f : pcacontrib ] ( bottom ) and fig .",
    "[ f : pcacontrib ] ( top ) shows the explanation of each dimension . by plotting the first two dimensions , it is possible to account for almost 50% of the dispersion , while a clear differentiation between cities can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : pca ] .",
    "since it is impossible to visualize the high - dimensional data so as to try to recognize the clusters , we used an agglomerative clustering method , the so - called complete linkage method to perform this task . in this method ,",
    "the euclidean distance between two clusters is given by the value of the shortest distance between any object belonging to these clusters .",
    "the final result is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : dend ] as a dendrogram , where the colours correspond to the two clusters identified by using a threshold parameter 0.7 of the maximum distance between two cities .",
    "this figure clearly shows the emergence of one cluster of cities ( grey color ) and of a group of cities very different each others but still belonging to a single family ( black colour ) , so we may intepret this agglomeration as the existence of two main different classes or typologies of cities . in this classification a clear group composed by catania , bologna , sheffield , edinburgh and leicester is separated from geneve , lancaster , oxford , worcester and barcelona .",
    "though the reasons behind this separation may be manifold and it needs further experimental tests , we notice that comparing the plans of those cities and the topography of their terrain it is possible to conclude that physical constraints can be a key factor to classify cities .",
    "we have found that cities traversed by rivers or bordered by a lake were separated from those that the growth has never been boundend or divided by physical constraints .",
    "the exeption of barcelona , a city with a major planning events ( the plan cerd ) confirms this hypothesis posing the great urban planning operations in the list of the geographical constraints .",
    "in this research we analyse the street network of 10 european cities represented in a primal way , where intersections are translated into the nodes of a network and the connecting streets into the links .",
    "we study first the geometric properties of the networks and then the way centrality is distributed over them according to four different definition of centrality .",
    "we show that selected cities share several universal geometric patterns , such as the average street length ( which is limited within a remarkably narrow range of values ) , the distribution of angles between streets at intersections , and the distribution of the total length of dead end streets as a function of the area of the cycle they belong to .",
    "in addition , we confirm that the distribution of street lengths follows universal power law behavior in the long tail of the dataset , i.e. for high values of street length . however , we highlight that the conventional way to represent the distribution of street lengths in search of the power law behavior leaves out of the picture the vast majority of the data , i.e. the number of streets whose length distribution can not be accurately fitted by a power law function is in the order of the 90% of the whole dataset .",
    "we therefore investigated the actual behaviour of the street length distribution in a semi - log scale finding the emergence of remarkably different behaviours that seemingly reflect the diversity of local history and conditions .",
    "finally , we found that the distribution of the four centrality indices over the street networks allows us to clearly characterize two different clusters of cities that appear to be predominantly informed by major topographic and geographic local features like the presence of rivers or lakes .",
    "we also found that planning events of extreme magnitude like the occurrence of the plan cerd in barcelona may account for the uniqueness of this city as measured through the distribution of street centrality .",
    "we show how the analysis of simple geometric properties of the street network as well as a more complex evaluation of the street centrality can highlight differences between cities and how these differences can be used for classifying cities in categories .",
    "it is clear that global geometric characteristics of the street network exhibit `` universal '' behaviors but it is reasonable to argue that , as these behaviors equally emerge in a vast range of transportation networks in nature and technology that like the street networks are mainly planar , the universality of those features may be related to the planarity of the systems rather than a particular `` nature '' of cities as such .",
    "regarding the analysis of the morphology of cities , we believe our study highlights that if the universal rules governing the evolution of planar hierarchical networks are not discriminated , the extreme differences of their inner urban structure may be easily underestimated and , from a qualitative point of view , it may leave local patterns out of the picture .",
    "we focused on this discrimination process showing how to operate at global level in order to highlight local patterns where the extreme diversity of our cities emerges and should be accounted for , especially when we move on to the problem of classification , i.e. that of finding a taxonomy for urban types .",
