    "while it is not unusual for a univariate polynomial @xmath0 with real coefficients to have _ some _ real roots  under reasonable assumptions we expect @xmath1 real roots  @xcite  it is rare for a polynomial to have all of its roots real . in a sense , the only natural example of a polynomial with all of its roots real is the characteristic polynomial of a real symmetric matrix , as all eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are real .    similarly , when a system of real polynomial equations has finitely many ( _ a priori _ complex ) solutions , we expect some , but likely not all , solutions to be real .",
    "in fact , upper bounds on the number of real solutions  @xcite sometimes ensure that not all solutions can be real .",
