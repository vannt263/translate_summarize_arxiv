    "in a recent paper , levin @xcite discusses the set of results presented over the last decade by various prominent physicists which led to the conclusion that black holes seem to be susceptible to chaos .",
    "levin argues that the most realistic description available of a spinning pair of black holes is chaotic motion , and goes on to complain that in physics and cosmology chaos has not received the attention it deserves in part because the systems studied have been highly idealized . in contrast , in economics we have the interesting fact that even some of the most simple and highly idealized models describing modern economies can easily lead to chaotic dynamics .",
    "in this paper we apply the techniques of symbolic dynamics to the analysis of a labor market which shows in almost developed economies large volatility in employment flows .",
    "the possibility that chaotic dynamics may arise in modern labor markets had been totally strange to economics until recently , at least as far as we are aware of . in an interesting paper , bhattacharya and bunzel @xcite",
    "have found that the discrete time version of the pissarides - mortensen matching model , as formulated in ljungqvist and sargent @xcite , can easily lead to chaotic dynamics under standard sets of parameter values .",
    "however , in order to conclude about the existence of chaotic dynamics in the three numerical examples presented in the paper , the authors apply the li - yorke theorem or the mitra sufficient condition which should not be generally applied to all specific simulations because they may lead to misleading conclusions .",
    "moreover , in a more recent version of the paper , bhattacharya and bunzel @xcite present new results in which chaos is completely removed from the dynamics of the model .",
    "this paper explores the matching model so interestingly developed by bhattacharya and bunzel with the following objectives in mind : ( i ) to show that chaotic dynamics may still be present in the model for standard parameter values , for high values of the measure of labor tightness ( that is the ratio of vacancies to the number of workers looking for jobs ) which can occur in economic booms ; ( ii ) to clarify some open questions raised by the authors in their first paper , by providing a rigorous proof of the existence of chaotic dynamics in the model through the computation of topological entropy in a symbolic dynamics setting .",
    "therefore , if one is studying whether there are chaotic dynamics or not under certain ranges of parameters values , we suggest that a bifurcation diagram , the variation of the lyapunov exponent , the existence of a periodic orbit of period not equal to a power of two and positive topological entropy are some techniques that can give a clear answer to this problem .",
    "why would the labor market in most of the developed economies behave in such a volatile way as the evidence points out ?",
    "one possibility , and usually the most favoured one in the dominant view of economics , is that the economyhas an inherently linear structure and is hit by permanent exogenous shocks .  as these shocks are entirely unpredictable , they render the dynamics and the cycles hardly predictable and controllable .",
    "another more recent view , which should also be considered for discussion because it seems consistent and realistic , is based on the possibility that the economy has a structure that is nonlinear and the cycles are an endogenous manifestation of this characteristic , either with or without external shocks added to the structure . in what follows",
    ", a very simple and fully deterministic model will be presented that is capable of generating such type of volatility with standard parameter sets and no noise .",
    "let us assume that in every period of time there are large flows of workers moving into and out of employment : a certain number of job vacancies is posted by firms @xmath0 and there is a total measure of workers looking for jobs @xmath1 .",
    "when a worker and a firm reach an agreement there is a successful match , and the total number of these matches is given by the aggregate matching function @xmath2the intuition behind ( [ eqm(u , v ) ] ) is very simple : the higher is @xmath3 the easier it will be for firms to get a worker with the desired qualifications ; and the higher is the level of vacancies posted by firms @xmath4 , the higher is the probability that a worker will find an appropriate job . for simplicity we will assume @xmath5 as a constant .",
    "however , a more adequate treatment would consist of treating @xmath5 as a variable dependent on the level of public provision of information by public agencies with the objective of increasing the number of successful matches .",
    "the measure of labor tightness is given by the ratio @xmath6 then , the probability of a vacancy being filled at @xmath7 is given by@xmath8    let @xmath9 be the total number of employed workers at the beginning of @xmath10 and let @xmath11 be defined as the probability of a match being dissolved at @xmath7 . therefore we have @xmath12 where @xmath13 notice that @xmath14 gives the number of undissolved matches prevailing at @xmath7 and passed on to @xmath15 , while @xmath16 represents the number of new matches formed at @xmath7 with the available number of unemployed workers and vacancies .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the model can be solved for the decentralized outcome of a nash bargaining game between workers and firms but to keep the model as close as possible to the presentation in @xcite and @xcite we should focus upon the central planner solution to the matching model .",
    "the objective function of the central planner is given by @xmath17where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are parameters that represent , respectively , the productivity of each worker , the lost value of leisure due to labor effort , and the cost that firms incur per vacancy placed in the market .",
    "therefore , the planner chooses @xmath21 and the next period s employment level , @xmath22 by solving the following dynamic optimization problem@xmath23\\]]subject to@xmath24where @xmath25 is the time discount rate and an initial condition @xmath26 is given .",
    "the lagrangian can be written as @xmath27 + \\lambda _ { t}\\left [ \\left ( 1-s\\right ) n_{t}+q\\left ( \\frac{v_{t}}{1-n_{t}}\\right ) v - n_{t+1}\\right ] \\right\\ } .\\]]the first order conditions ( foc ) , for an interior solution , are given by@xmath28 = 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial n_{t+1}}=-\\lambda _",
    "{ t}+\\beta ^{t+1}\\left ( \\phi -z\\right ) + \\lambda _ { t+1}\\left [ \\left ( 1-s\\right ) + q^{\\prime } \\left ( \\theta _ { t+1}\\right ) \\theta _ { t+1}^{2}\\right ] = 0.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    the very interesting point in @xcite and @xcite was the manipulation of these foc to arrive at a reduced equation that can lead to chaotic dynamics . from the first foc we get @xmath29 and",
    "substituting this and the corresponding expression for @xmath30 into the second foc we obtain @xmath31with the following parameter definitions and restrictions@xmath32    equation ( [ eqpricipal ] ) gives the law of motion for the index of labor market tightness in the economy under the planner s solution .",
    "in other words , given an initial condition @xmath33 equation ( [ eqpricipal ] ) completely characterizes the trajectory of @xmath34 and the whole economy@xmath35",
    "so , the backward dynamics of this model can be characterized by the four - parameter one - dimensional family of maps @xmath36 \\rightarrow \\left [ 0,g_{\\max } \\right ] , $ ] where@xmath37with the parameter restrictions in ( [ eqparam ] ) and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is implicitly defined as the lowest positive root of the equation @xmath40 the first derivative of the map @xmath41 can be calculated as @xmath42 , \\]]which implies that @xmath41 is unimodal with a unique maximum ( critical point ) at @xmath43 in addition , @xmath41 has a unique fixed point located to the right of @xmath44 if @xmath45 the unique fixed point of @xmath41 is denoted by @xmath46 and is implicitly given by @xmath47 despite the impossibility of the computation of an explicit expression for @xmath48 the unicity of this solution is obvious by considering @xmath49 and  @xmath50where @xmath51 is monotonically decreasing for @xmath34 from @xmath44 to @xmath52 and @xmath53 is monotonically increasing for @xmath34 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 therefore @xmath56 has a unique solution for @xmath57    the fixed point is an attractor in the case of backward dynamics if @xmath58 and in forward dynamics if @xmath59  for @xmath60 a period - doubling bifurcation occurs and the fixed point changes stability . since it is not possible to obtain a closed form expression for @xmath48 this condition can not be checked in general but can be checked for each set of parameters separately .",
    "the first main objective is to show that the matching model leads to chaotic motion in the backward dynamics and the second purpose is to provide a very rigorous method to compute topological entropy for uni(multi)-modal maps .",
    "generally , the search for chaos in one - dimensional maps is mainly based on the application of the well - known li - yorke theorem , but when a period three fails to be encountered it is necessary to use some other criteria . in what follows ,",
    "we use the kneading sequence ( the trajectory initiated at the critical point of the unimodal map ) and the associated markov transition matrix in order to compute the topological entropy of the map .",
    "these are tools from symbolic dynamics which provide simple and exact methods to conclude about the existence of chaos in multimodal maps .    in @xcite",
    "the authors conclude that the unique fixed point @xmath61 of the map ( [ eqmapa ] ) is always stable in backward dynamics , for almost any choice of the parameters values with respect to conditions ( [ eqparam ] ) .",
    "we obtain a different result : while for most reasonable sets of parameter values the fixed point is stable , however there are also other sets of parameter values that allow for unstable chaotic motion in the model as we show next .    for @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66",
    "we obtain chaotic motion for the nonlinear map presented in ( eqmapa ) .",
    "moreover , this is true for almost any value of @xmath67 in the interval @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "the first point which we would like to emphasize is that all parameter values satisfy the restrictions presented in equation ( [ eqparam ] ) . that is@xmath69this is illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] , where the unimodal map and the typical chaotic time series associated to the unstable fixed point @xmath70 are presented .",
    "the first derivative of the unimodal map is @xmath71 , which shows that the equilibrium is unstable . by varying the parameter @xmath67 in the interval",
    "@xmath72 $ ] we obtain the classical period - doubling route to chaos which is also illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "so , for any value of @xmath67 arising after the @xmath73 bifurcation point , we encounter chaotic dynamics .",
    "we should point out that in order to obtain the bifurcation diagram illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 have also to have their values changed , as they are continuously depending on the values of @xmath76 the parameter restrictions are always satisfied , since @xmath77    moreover , in figure [ fig2 ] the bifurcation diagram is illustrated when the parameter @xmath78 is varied between @xmath79 and @xmath80 and taking the same parameter calibration as in the above proposition : @xmath81 and @xmath82 there is also a period - doubling route to chaos , but the map @xmath83 dynamics escapes to infinity before the occurrence of a period three orbit .",
    "this presents one more reason to consider the complete sharkowski relation between the periodic orbits of the map and to apply some other techniques in the search for chaos in this specific model . in the same figure",
    "we also represent the variation of the lyapunov exponent for @xmath78 belonging to the interval @xmath84.$ ] we recall that positive lyapunov exponent is a necessary condition for chaos .",
    "bhattacharya and bunzel @xcite suggest three examples for the study of the dynamics of the map @xmath41 . in the first case a period 3-cycle is found , which implies the existence of chaos in the li - yorke sense if the sharkovsky order is applied . in the second example",
    ", it was argued that a period 3-orbit could not be found for the following parameter values : @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 since the equation @xmath89 has no solution . since the map @xmath41 is unimodal and mitra s sufficient condition for chaos in unimodal maps",
    "is verified , the conclusion was that for this parameter setting chaotic motion in the backward dynamics could also be found . where @xmath90 is a non - negative interval",
    ", @xmath91 is the critical point such that @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the unique fixed point of the map such that @xmath94 mitra states that : if @xmath95 satisfies @xmath96 and @xmath97 , then @xmath98 shows topological chaos . ] finally , in the third example the set of parameters are : @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 for these values no period three orbit is found , neither the sufficient condition of mitra is verified .",
    "therefore , it was argued that for this case the very existence of chaos for the unimodal map is questioned on the grounds of a lack of logical proof of such dynamics .    in order to clarify some of the issues raised by @xcite ,",
    "a symbolic dynamics approach is developed for the unimodal map @xmath41 , which allow us to perform the computation of the topological entropy for any choice of parameters , and , of course , permit us to classify the complexity of the map since positive topological entropy implies the existence of chaotic dynamics .",
    "we will concentrate on their third example .",
    "we consider again the unimodal map",
    "@xmath36 \\rightarrow % \\left [ 0,g_{\\max } \\right ] .$ ] this kind of map has symbolic dynamics relative to a topological markov partition generated by the orbit of the critical point @xmath43 this is illustrated in figure [ figmarkov ] for the parameter values presented in example 2 .",
    "so , any numerical trajectory @xmath103 for the map @xmath41 corresponds to a symbolic sequence @xmath104 where @xmath105 depending on where the point @xmath106 falls in , i.e.,@xmath107all symbolic sequences made of these letters may be ordered by the natural lexicographical order @xmath108 and    defining the fullshift @xmath109 to be the set of all possible infinite symbolic strings of @xmath110 s and @xmath111 s , then any given infinite symbolic sequence is a singleton in the fullshift space .",
    "the bernoulli shift map @xmath112 is defined by @xmath113 . in general ,",
    "not all symbolic sequences correspond to the trajectory of an initial condition @xmath114 restricting the shift map to a subset of @xmath115 consisting of all the itineraries that are realizable yields the subshift @xmath116    we formulate the result in terms of topological markov chains , a special class of subshifts of finite type where the transition in the symbol sequence is specified by a @xmath117 matrix .",
    "any @xmath118 binary matrix @xmath119 generates a special subshift @xmath120which is called the topological markov chain associated with the markov matrix @xmath121 .",
    "we say that @xmath122 if the transition from @xmath123 to @xmath124 is possible .",
    "the matrix @xmath121 gives a complete description of the dynamics of the unimodal map .",
    "the premier numerical invariant of a dynamic system is its topological entropy defined by @xmath125where @xmath126 is the set of words of length @xmath127 occurring in sequences of @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , if the topological markov matrix @xmath121 is given then , the topological entropy is the natural logarithm of the spectral radius of @xmath121 .    for the parameter values @xmath85",
    "@xmath86 @xmath129 @xmath88 , we found a period 5 orbit : @xmath130 which is shown in figure [ figmarkov ] with the corresponding 4 interval @xmath131 markov partition .",
    "the critical point assumes the value @xmath132 and generates the symbolic partition for the map @xmath133 the periodic orbit has the following symbolic address : @xmath134 and in consequence we have the following markov matrix:@xmath135 .\\]]the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath121 is given by @xmath136 which implies that the topological entropy is positive : @xmath137 and this shows very clearly that we are dealing with chaotic motion in this set of parameter values .",
    "it should be noted that for any other kneading sequence , for a suitable choice of parameters values , we can obtain a markov partition and a markov matrix which totally determine the complexity of the unimodal map .",
    "this is a very simple and rigorous way to estimate the topological entropy of a one - dimensional model and to check for the existence of chaos .",
    "the general use of the li - yorke theorem or the mitra condition may lead to misleading conclusions about the existence of chaotic dynamics , as it was done in @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain relevant answers to whether there are or not chaotic dynamics under certain ranges of parameters values in a 1-dimensional particular model , we suggest that a bifurcation diagram , the variation of the lyapunov exponent , the existence of a periodic point of period not equal to a power of two , and symbolic dynamics are very powerful techniques for that purpose . moreover , the application of these techniques to the matching labor market model so interestingly developed by bhattacharya and bunzel clearly confirmed that a very simple model of the labor market , with well behaved aggregate functions ( continuous , twice differentiable and linearly homogeneous ) do really produce chaotic behavior for a range of parameter sets which had been questioned in @xcite , for high values of the measure of labor market tightness .    financial support from the fundao cincia e tecnologia , lisbon , is grateful acknowledged , under the contract no pocti/ eco /48628/ 2002 , partially funded by the european regional development fund ( erdf ) ."
