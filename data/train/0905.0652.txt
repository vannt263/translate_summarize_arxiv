    "<S> a long - lived decaying dark matter as a resolution to fermi , pamela and atic anomalies is investigated in the framework of split supersymmetry ( susy ) without r - parity , where the neutralino is regarded as the dark matter and the extreme fine - tuned couplings for the long - lived neutralino are naturally evaded in the usual approach . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectra of electron and positron are from not only the direct neutralino decays denoted by @xmath0 , but also the decaying chains such as @xmath1 . we find that with a proper lifetime of the neutralino , slepton - mediated effects could explain the atic and pamela data well , but a inconsistence occurs to it the fermi and pamela data without considering the atic one . </S>",
    "<S> however , by a suitable combination of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , the sneutrino - mediated effects could simultaneously account for the fermi and pamela data .    </S>",
    "<S> it is mysterious that the direct measured matter in the standard model ( sm ) only occupies @xmath3 of our universe while dark matter and dark energy have the occupancies of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it becomes a very important issue to understand what the dark stuff is . through high energy colliders such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern </S>",
    "<S> , we may directly observe dark matter . on the other hand , by the study of the high energy cosmic - ray </S>",
    "<S> , we may have the chance to probe dark matter indirectly .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , pamela  @xcite and atic  @xcite collaborations have published some astonished events in cosmic - ray measurements , in which the former finds the excess in the positron flux ratio with energies in the @xmath6 gev range , while the later observes anomaly in the electron+positron flux in the @xmath7 gev range . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , these data are consistent with the measurements of the high energy electron and positron fluxes in the cosmic ray spectra by ppb - bets  @xcite , heat  @xcite , ams  @xcite and hess  @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by the pamela / atic anomalies , various interesting possible mechanisms to generate the high energy positrons and electrons are proposed , such as pulsars @xcite , dark matter annihilations @xcite and dark matter decays @xcite . very recently , a more precision measurement on the electron+positron flux by the fermi collaboration  @xcite with the similar energy range as atic has shown some enhancement in flux in the higher energy range . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fermi s result indicates smaller fluxes than the atic data in the 500 gev range . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in our study we consider both data . </S>",
    "<S> other relevant studies could be referred to ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the mechanism of dark matter annihilations could provide the source for the fermi , pamela and atic ( fpa ) anomalies , it is inevitable that an enhanced boost factor of a few orders of magnitude , such as sommerfeld enhancement @xcite , near - threshold resonance and dark - onium formation @xcite , has to be introduced . in this paper , we investigate other sources for the excess of positrons and electrons in fpa without a large boost factor . </S>",
    "<S> we will concentrate on the mechanism of dark matter decays . </S>",
    "<S> as known that in order to make the unstable dark matter be long - lived , say @xmath8 , usually we have to fine - tune either couplings to be tiny or the scale of the intermediate state to be as large as the gut scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our purpose is to explore what kind of the long - lived dark matter in the extension of the sm that could satisfy one of two criteria naturally , at least in technique .    in the literature , </S>",
    "<S> one of the popular sm extensions is supersymmetry ( susy ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been known that the effects of susy at the scale @xmath9 of @xmath10 can solve not only the hierarchy problem , but also the problem of the unified gauge coupling @xcite . moreover , the predicted lightest neutralino in supersymmetric models could also provide the candidate of dark matter @xcite . in spite of </S>",
    "<S> the above successes , models with susy still suffer some difficulties from phenomenological reasons , such as the problems on small cp violating phases , large flavor mixings and proton decays , as well as they predict too large cosmological constant . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , a fine tuning always comes up in the low energy physics . in order to interpret the cosmological constant problem and maintain the beauty of the ordinary low - energy susy models , </S>",
    "<S> the scenario of split susy is suggested @xcite , in which the susy breaking scale is much higher than the electroweak scale . in this split susy scenario , except the sm higgs which could be as light as the current experimental limit , the scalar particles are all ultra - heavy , denoted by @xmath11 gev . on the other hand , by the protection of approximate chiral symmetries </S>",
    "<S> , the masses of sfermions , such as gauginos and higgsinos , could be at the electroweak scale @xcite . clearly , split susy not only supplies the candidate of fermionic dark matter at the tev scale but also provides a large scale for the susy breaking , so that the second criterion mentioned early for model - searches is satisfied automatically . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the ultraheavy scalar sparticles could play the role of messenger to deliver the dark matter decay , the decay rate of the dark stuff is suppressed and the lifetime of the unstable dark matter could be still long enough to explain the fpa puzzle .    in split supersymmetric models with r - parity , </S>",
    "<S> the neutralino regarded as the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is a stable particle . to study the dark matter </S>",
    "<S> decays , we extend our consideration to the framework of split susy with the violation of r - parity , in which the conservations of lepton or / and baryon numbers are broken . since fpa anomalies only involve leptons , it is plausible to only consider lepton number violating effects by requiring a good symmetry on the baryon number . as usual , </S>",
    "<S> the superpotential for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with bilinear and trilinear terms that violate the lepton number is expressed by w&=&w_mssm + w_r , + w_mssm&= & h^_ij l_i h_d e^c_j + h^d_ij q_i h_d d^c_j + h^u_ij q_i h_u u^c_j + h_d h_u , + w_r&= & _ [ ij]k l_i l_j e^c_k + _ijk l_i q_j d^c_k + _ i l_i </S>",
    "<S> h_u . we note that the bilinear term @xmath12 could be rotated away by redefining the superfield as @xmath13 . in the ordinary susy model </S>",
    "<S> , the bilinear operator could be reinduced by loop effects . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the scenario of split susy , since all bosonic sparticles are very heavy , the loop induced effects are highly suppressed and negligible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , with the measurement on the antiproton flux by pamela that shows no exotic events , it is conceivable to set the quarks related effects governed by the parameters @xmath14 as small as possible . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : rp ] ) and ( [ eq : int_neutralino ] ) , we see that split susy with the r - parity violation has two channels to decay to the charged leptons : one is via the charged sleptons and another one is mediated by sneutrinos , where we sketch the feynman diagrams in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> before we make the detailed analysis for the energy spectra of electron and positron in neutralino decays , it is worthwhile to understand the allowed range of free parameters to satisfy the condition of the long - lived dark matter . </S>",
