    "it is expected to be even higher .",
    "hence , understanding of the physical pattern of the small - angle elastic scattering of hadrons is indispensable for general understanding of the strong interaction at ultra - high energies .",
    "however , the special status of diffractive studies at high - energy colliders is determined by the fact that diffraction of hadrons takes place due to interaction at large distances .",
    "indeed , the transverse size of the hadron interaction region can be estimated through straight application of the corresponding heisenberg uncertainty relation to the experimental elastic angular distributions .",
    "for example , at the sps , tevatron , and lhc energies it is of order 1 fm .",
    "therefore , exploitation of perturbative qcd for treatment of hadronic diffraction is disabled .",

    "the co - existence of a large number of rather complicated ( and , often , incompatible ) models points to the relevance of the question if construction of a much simpler ( but adequate ) approximation is possible .",
    "the word `` adequate '' in the last sentence implies as the theoretical correctness , so the satisfactory description of the high - energy evolution of the diffractive pattern .    the aim of this work is to demonstrate that a very simple and physically transparent description can be provided in the framework of the well - known regge - eikonal approach @xcite which originates from the synthesis of regge theory and quasi - potential approximation .",
    "the regge - eikonal approach to description of the elastic scattering of hadrons exploits the eikonal representation of the nonflip scattering amplitude : @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mandelstam variables , @xmath5 is the impact parameter , and eikonal @xmath6 is the sum of single - reggeon - exchange terms : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the @xmath10-even and @xmath10-odd regge trajectories , @xmath11 are the corresponding reggeon form - factors of the colliding particles , @xmath12 gev@xmath13 , @xmath14 are the so - called reggeon signature factors , @xmath15 for even reggeons , @xmath16 for odd reggeons , and the sign `` @xmath17 '' ( `` @xmath18 '' ) before the @xmath10-odd reggeon contributions corresponds to the particle - particle ( particle - antiparticle ) interaction",

    "an important advantage of this approach is that it allows to satisfy the froissart - martin bound @xcite explicitly .",
    "let us consider the ultimate case of the nucleon - nucleon diffraction at ultra - high energies , where the eikonal can be approximated by the only regge pole term corresponding to the leading even and @xmath10-even reggeon ( called `` pomeron '' or `` soft pomeron '' in literature ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the regge trajectory of pomeron and @xmath21 is the pomeron form - factor of nucleon .    in the current stage of development",

    "the fact of such a disagreement is not surprising , since the impact of secondary reggeon exchanges is expected to be significant at the isr energies . adding some test exponential term to the eikonal , @xmath36 ( here @xmath37 ( 62.5 gev)@xmath13 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 gev@xmath40 ) , one makes this disagreement much less catastrophic ( fig .",

    "four secondary reggeons are expected to give a noticeable contribution at the isr energies : two even and @xmath10-even reggeons , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and two odd and @xmath10-odd reggeons , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . with account of these secondaries , the @xmath0 scattering eikonal ( [ ppeik ] ) takes the following form : @xmath49 @xmath50\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53\\,.\\ ] ]    the secondary reggeon intercepts can be estimated with the help of their linear chew - frautschi plots ( here @xmath54 is some regge trajectory and @xmath55 is the resonance spin ) which do not imply that @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the decay widths @xmath58 are only few times less than the corresponding masses @xmath59 : for example , for @xmath60-meson @xmath61 , and for @xmath62-meson @xmath63 .",

    "[ reson ] ) : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and , thus , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 . regarding the @xmath4-evolution of the leading @xmath71-reggeons",
    ", one should keep in mind that @xmath72 at @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "hence , in the region @xmath24 , the true secondary regge trajectories should be essentially nonlinear and very different from the corresponding chew - frautschi plots .",
    "therefore , for all of the mentioned secondaries , we expect the real parts of their signature factors to be negative at @xmath24 and to be , at least , several times higher in magnitude than the factor @xmath74 .",
    "as well , it should be noted that in the @xmath0 elastic scattering the contributions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 into @xmath75 partially compensate the contributions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while in @xmath76 the corresponding terms have the same ( negative ) sign ( see ( [ eikseco ] ) ) . under such conditions",
    ", it seems quite natural that , at the @xmath0 collision energy 62.5 gev and low values of the transferred momentum , the combined contribution of secondary reggeons makes @xmath75 a few percents higher than @xmath77 and makes @xmath76 two - three times lower than @xmath78 .",
    "= 7.8cm=7.8 cm -8 cm 8.5 cm = 8.2cm=8.2 cm    in the framework of the discussed physical pattern , it is possible to explain the noticeable discrepancy between the @xmath79 and @xmath0 differential cross - sections in some vicinity of the dip ( fig .",
    "[ isr53 ] ) without any appeal to the notion of odderon ( the leading @xmath10-odd reggeon with the intercept higher than 1.0 ) . due to the suppression of the pomeron term in @xmath76 by the factor @xmath80 ,",
    "the relative contribution of @xmath47 and @xmath48 into @xmath76 is much more significant than into @xmath75 .",
    "these real terms are positive for @xmath79 scattering and negative for @xmath0 scattering",
    ". therefore , @xmath76 for @xmath79 scattering could be noticeably higher than for @xmath0 scattering . as the angular distribution behavior in some small vicinity of the dip depends on @xmath81 strongly , so , in this vicinity , the @xmath79 differential cross - section is expected to be appreciably larger than the @xmath0 differential cross - section ( and this is the very pattern which takes place in experiment ) .",
    "if the odderon exchange effect is really negligible , the splitting between the @xmath79 and @xmath0 angular distributions should vanish at higher energies .    -0.5 cm",
    "-0.5 cm    in view of the above - said , we infer that although the one - reggeon ( pomeron ) eikonal approximation to the nucleon - nucleon elastic scattering amplitude is invalid at the isr energies , the deviations from the experimental data on the corresponding differential cross - sections are , in principle , consistent with the expected phenomenology of secondary reggeons at low negative values of @xmath4 .",
    "the influence of secondaries decreases fast with the collision energy growth .",
    "for instance , at @xmath35 200 gev the combined relative contribution of secondary reggeon exchanges is expected to be about 1 - 2 percents for @xmath75 and about 10 - 20 percents for @xmath76 . therefore , the model predictions of the @xmath0 scattering observables at the rhic energy ( see fig .",
    "[ pp ] ) could be adequate not only for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , but also for @xmath84 , excluding the very vicinity of the dip .",
    "in other words , at the collision energy about 200 gev the nucleon - nucleon elastic diffraction passes into the pure pomeron - exchange regime .",
    "the practical benefit of the one - reggeon eikonal approximation is that , in the kinematic range of diffractive scattering , it allows to reduce the unknown complex function of two variables , @xmath85 , to 2 monotonic functions of one variable , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in spite of its roughness and , especially , of @xmath21 than stiff test expressions ( [ pomeron ] ) . ]",
    ", the proposed phenomenological scheme provides a satisfactory description of the nucleon - nucleon elastic scattering at the collision energies 0.54 tev @xmath86 7 tev and transferred momenta squared 0.005 gev@xmath29 2 gev@xmath13 and allows to give well - grounded predictions for the diffractive pattern at higher ( the lhc ) and lower ( the rhic ) energies .",
    "nonetheless , confirmation or discrimination of the model is possible after the forthcoming totem measurements of the @xmath0 differential cross - section at @xmath35 14 tev ( the analogous measurements at the rhic are , as well , very desirable ) . in the case of confirmation",
    ", the one - reggeon eikonal approximation could become an effective tool for treatment of the nucleon - nucleon elastic diffraction at ultra - high energies , due to its salient simplicity and physical clearness .",
    "besides , the pomeron regge trajectory and the pomeron form - factor of nucleon are used in the framework of the regge approach to more complicated ( than @xmath87 ) diffractive reactions : single diffraction ( @xmath88 or @xmath89 ) , central exclusive diffractive production of the higgs boson ( @xmath90 ) , _ etc ... _ therefore , the possibility of implicit extraction of @xmath20 and @xmath21 from the experimental angular distributions of nucleon - nucleon elastic scattering is very important for raising the predictive efficiency of the reggeon models describing the energy evolution of the corresponding cross - sections .",
