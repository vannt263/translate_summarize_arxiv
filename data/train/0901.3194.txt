    "the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) provided the first evidence of the cosmic speed up @xcite opening the way to a flood of theoretical and observational efforts devoted to investigate the nature and the nurture of such a phenomenon .",
    "the astrophysical data coming from later sneia samples , baryonic acoustic oscillations @xcite , the anisotropy spectrum of cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite and the large scale structure data from large galaxy redshift surveys @xcite have strenghtened the then surprising result . as a consequence ,",
    "there is nowadays little doubt that the universe is spatially flat , has a low matter content ( @xmath5 ) and is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion . to close the energy budget and",
    "drive the cosmic speed up , a new fluid with negative pressure dubbed dark energy has been invoked as the only viable solution . understanding what dark energy really is stands out as one of the most fascinating problems of modern cosmology . roughly speaking",
    ", we can divide the different proposals in two broad categories . in the first class",
    ", one can include all models considering dark energy as a true fluid with unusual properties with proposals ranging from the classical cosmological constant @xmath3 @xcite to scalar fields running down their self interaction potential @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one may give off general relativity resorting to modified gravity theories such as @xmath6 models ( see , e.g. , capozziello et al .",
    "2008 , sotiriou & faraoni 2008 and references therein ) and braneworld cosmologies @xcite manifesting themselves as a fictitious dark energy - like fluid .    notwithstanding their radically different inspiring phylosophies",
    ", all the viable theories share the same ability to be in satisfactory agreement with the available data .",
    "such a confusing situation is a clear evidence that present dataset are unable to discriminate among different models .",
    "such a problem comes out as a consequence of the still low redshift range probed .",
    "the sneia hubble diagram is an illuminating example .",
    "as well known , the distance modulus @xmath2 scales linearly with the logarithm of the luminosity distance @xmath7 which depends on the dark energy equation of state through a double integration .",
    "discriminating among different models asks for extending the hubble diagram to higher redshifts since the expressions for the @xmath8 and hence @xmath2 are more and more different as one goes to higher and higher @xmath0 values .",
    "unfortunately , such a project can not be undertaken relying on sneia since , even with excellent space based projects such as snap @xcite , it is almost impossible going to @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , up to now , most of the sneia observed have redshift @xmath10 with only one sn at @xmath11 . on the contrary , gamma ray bursts ( grbs )",
    "are ideal candidates from this point of view .",
    "indeed , thanks to their enormous energy release , they have been observed up to redshift @xmath12 , the most distant one being grb080913 with @xmath13 @xcite . as high as @xmath14 .",
    "there is , however , a fierce problem to overcome .",
    "actually , grbs are not standard candles so that it is not immediately possible to build their hubble diagram . to this aim , one has to look for a correlation between a distance dependent quantity and a directly observable property .",
    "many of these correlations have been suggested in the last few years so that the route towards making grbs standardizeable candles ( in the same way as sneia ) is now open .",
    "actually , various attempts to build a grbs hubble diagram have yet been made .",
    "bradley ( 2003 ) first derived the luminosity distances of 9 grbs with known redshifts by using two grbs luminosity relations thus providing the first grbs hubble diagram .",
    "dai et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and xu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have then proposed a methodology to constrain cosmological parameters using grbs and apply it to preliminary samples ( made out of 12 and 17 objects respectively ) relying on the ghirlanda relation .",
    "a bayesian based approach was instead proposed by firmani et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , later improved by the same authors @xcite advocating the joint use of grbs and sneia .    as a firt summary of these efforts , schaefer ( 2007 ) has compiled a catalog of 69 grbs with measured properties entering the five two parameters correlation then available .",
    "estimating @xmath2 from each single correlation and performing a weighted average , schaefer have finally built the first grbs hubble diagram which has later been used in different cosmological analyses @xcite .",
    "we update here the schaefer work by many aspects .",
    "first , we add the recently found @xmath15 correlation @xcite with @xmath16 the x - ray luminosity at the time @xmath17 and @xmath17 a timescale characterizing the late afterglow decay .",
    "the use of this new correlation allows us to both increase the grbs sample and reduce the uncertainty on @xmath2 .",
    "we then recalibrate all the six correlations considered using a fiducial @xmath3cdm cosmological model in agreement with the wmap5 @xcite data and a bayesian motivated fitting technique @xcite .",
    "we are now able to build a new grbs hubble diagram whose dependence on the background cosmological model used for the calibration is explored .",
    "finally , we present a novel method to escape the circularity problem , i.e. to calibrate the grbs empirical laws without assuming any a priori cosmological model .",
    "this gives us then the possibility to build up a new grbs hubble diagram less affected by systematic uncertainties related to the unknown cosmological scenario .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we briefly review the different grbs 2d correlations known insofar and present the bayesian motivated method we will use in the following to calibrate them .",
    "such a calibration is performed in sect .",
    "3.1 using a fiducial @xmath3cdm model with parameters set according to the recent wmap5 results .",
    "these calibrated relations are then used in sect .",
    "3.2 to build a hubble diagram comprising 83 objects , while sect .",
    "3.3 explores what is the impact of varying the cosmological model used in the calibration on the estimated distance modulus .",
    "4.1 presents the local regression method showing how it is possible to use the union sneia sample to recover the value of @xmath2 in a cosmological model independent way .",
    "this method is then used to calibrate the 2d correlations for the grbs with @xmath18 in sect .",
    "4.2 so that a newly calibrated grbs hubble diagram may be built in sect .",
    "4.3 where we also compare this latter to the fiducial one .",
    "the impact of different kind of systematics on the derived hubble diagrams is investigated in sect .",
    "having thus checked the reliability of the grbs hds thus obtained , we present in sect . 6 a first cosmological analysis and discusses the importance of grbs as a cosmological tool presenting a forecast of the precision affordable on the matter density parameter , @xmath19 , and the dark energy equation of state . finally , sect .",
    "7 is devoted to the conclusions , while in the appendix we tabulate the estimated distance modulus from the two different methods and make some few comments on possible outliers .",
    "in order to be as general as possible , let us denote with @xmath20 a distance independent property and let @xmath21 a given quantity with @xmath22 a redshift independent constant and @xmath7 the luminosity distance .",
    "let us suppose that we have been able to find a correlation between them such as :    @xmath23    should the relation be calibrated , i.e. the parameters @xmath24 be known , we can then use it to compute the distance modulus @xmath2 of an object at redshift @xmath0 simply as :    @xmath25    where all the quantities are now known .",
    "notwithstanding its conceptual simplicity , performing such a program for grbs is far to be trivial .",
    "first , one has to find such a two parameters ( hereafter , 2d ) correlation , i.e. decide what are the quantities @xmath26 .",
    "as we will see , there are different choices which seems to work satisfactorily well , but the intrinsic scatter around the best fit line is usually not negligible .",
    "moreover , it is still not clear what is the underlying physical mechanism originating the empirical 2d correlations found . as a second more important problem ,",
    "calibrating such relations is a still open problem . indeed , since local grbs , i.e. grbs with @xmath27 , are not available , the only one being grb980425 @xcite , one has typically assume an a priori cosmological model to compute @xmath7 and hence @xmath28 so that the calibration turns out to be model dependent thus leading to the well known circularity problem when one aims at using grbs as cosmological probes . as a third problem",
    ", the calibration procedure is performed using a variety of statistical methods so that the results from the use of different correlations can not be straightforwardly compared .    in the following ,",
    "we first briefly review the known 2d correlations and then describe a bayesian motivated fitting procedure to determine the calibration parameters @xmath24 and the intrinsic scatter @xmath29 once a grb sample is available .",
    "the 2d correlations we will discuss here typically relate a grb observable with the isotropic absolute luminosity @xmath30 or the collimation corrected energy @xmath31 , with a single case correlating with the x - ray afterglow luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "the observable properties cover a wide range of grbs features including both quantities related to the energy spectrum and the light curve . in the first class",
    ", we find the peak energy @xmath32 , which is the energy at whith the @xmath33 spectrum is brightest , and the time lag @xmath34 , which measures the time offset between the arrival of the low and high energy photons . to the light curve shape",
    "are instead related the rise time @xmath35 , which is the shortest time over which the light curve rises by half the peak flux of the burst , and the variability @xmath36 , which quantifies the smoothness of the light curve itself .",
    "somewhat different is the @xmath37 correlation , with @xmath16 the luminosity at the time @xmath17 and @xmath17 a time scale , both referring to the x - ray afterglow decay curve .",
    "as yet said , neither @xmath30 nor @xmath31 are directly measurable quantities since they depend on the luminosity distance @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , it is :    @xmath38    @xmath39    here , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the bolometric peak flux and fluence , respectively , while @xmath42 is the beaming factor with @xmath43 the rest frame time of achromatic break in the afterglow light curve .",
    "note that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are computed from the observed grb energy spectrum @xmath44 as follows @xcite :    @xmath45    @xmath46    with @xmath47 and @xmath48 the observed peak energy and fluence in units of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , and @xmath51 the detection thresholds of the observing instrument .",
    "note that the energy spectrum is modelled using a smoothly broken power - law @xcite which reads :    @xmath52 e_p \\\\ ~ & ~ \\\\ b e^{\\beta } & { \\rm otherwise } \\end{array } \\right . \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : band}\\ ] ]    while @xmath30 and @xmath31 are bolometric quantities , we will also consider a recently found 2d correlations involving only x - ray observables .",
    "in particular , we will therefore be concerned with the luminosity in the x - ray . as a general rule ,",
    "if we denote by @xmath53 and @xmath54 the luminosity and the flux at the time @xmath55 in the afterglow light curve , one can write :    @xmath56    where the flux must be @xmath57-corrected @xcite as :    @xmath58    with @xmath59 set by the instrument bandpass and @xmath60 the energy spectrum in the x - ray band , well approximated as a single powerlaw . finally , @xmath61 describes the time variation of the flux along the afterglow curve and is parametrized as given in willingale et al .",
    "note that eq.([eq : lx ] ) is the same as eq.([eq : lpbolo ] ) the only difference being the integration limits at the numerator .",
    "actually , while @xmath30 is the bolometric luminosity , @xmath16 refers to the x - ray one so that we integrate only over this energy range .    as an important remark",
    ", it is worth stressing that all the 2d correlations we will use refer to quantities evaluated in the grb rest frame , while the observed spectra and light curves are in the earth orbiting satellite frames . as such , they are affected by time dilation and redshifting which have to be corrected for before the calibration procedure .",
    "all of the 2d correlations available insofar are power - laws so that it is useful to work in logarithmic units . as a general rule , we will therefore consider a linear rule as :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is a distance dependent quantity , while @xmath64 is not .",
    "different choices for @xmath65 determine the different 2d empirical laws . setting @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( where the factor @xmath68 corrects for redshifting ) gives the ghirlanda relation @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that this is the only relation involving an energy quantity , the other ones always involving a luminosity as @xmath63 quantity . indeed , setting @xmath69 , we can find 2d correlations for @xmath70 @xcite , @xmath71 @xcite , @xmath72 @xcite and @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "note that in all these correlations the factor @xmath68 or @xmath74 corrects for time dilation or redshifting , while the normalization is chosen in order to minimize the correlation between the errors .",
    "finally , setting @xmath75 and @xmath76 gives the 2d correlation empirically found for the first time in dainotti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and later confirmed by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2008 ) on a semitheoretical basis and by yamazaki ( 2008 ) in the framework of his model proposed to explain the observed plateau in the x - ray grbs afterglows .",
    "eq.([eq : linear ] ) is a linear relation which can be fitted to a given dataset @xmath77 in order to determine the two calibration parameters @xmath24 .",
    "actually , the situation is not so simple as one may naively expect . indeed , both the @xmath78 variables are affected by measurement uncertainties @xmath79 which can not be neglected .",
    "moreover , @xmath80 so that the simple rule to choose as independent variable in the fit the one with the smallest relative error can not be applied here . finally , the 2d correlations we are interested in are still not definitively explained by an underlying theoretical model determining the detailed features of the grbs explosion and afterglow phenomenology . both on theoretical and observational grounds",
    ", we do expect a certain amount of intrinsic scatter around the best fit line which has to be taken into account and determine together with @xmath24 by the fitting procedure .",
    "different statistical recipes are available to cope with these problems with each author having its own preferences .",
    "how the fitting technique employed affects the final estimate of the distance modulus for a given grb from the different 2d correlations is not clear so that it is highly desirable to recalibrate all of them with the same method .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as explained in the main text , the fiducial and calibrated hds contain a different number of grbs because it is not possible to use the local regression calibration for the @xmath16-@xmath17 relation .",
    "therefore , we report in table a1 the redshift and distance moduli of the 69 grbs common to both samples , while table a2 gives the same data for the 14 grbs present only in the fiducial hd .",
    "further material ( such as the values of @xmath81 from the single 2d correlations ) is available on request .",
    "as we have quoted in sect .",
    "4.3 , there are 13 ( 10 ) grbs deviating more than @xmath82 from the fiducial ( calibrated ) hd which are therefore likely outliers . actually , dealing with _",
    "likely outliers _ is a complicated task since one has to find a serious motivation before rejecting a given object from a sample . to this end",
    ", one should look both at its eventually peculiar features and the instrumental and observing setup which has been used to gather the corresponding data . since we have no access to these informations for all grbs , we have preferred to not reject them .    nonetheless , as an example",
    ", we discuss here the case of grb060614 which is the only grb deviating more than @xmath83 from both the fiducial hd and the @xmath16-@xmath17 correlation .",
    "indeed , this object is somewhat very peculiar being the first long grb observed at low redshift ( @xmath84 and clearly not associated to a bright ib / c sn @xcite .",
    "actually , its short duration ( @xmath85 ) makes it hardly classifiable as a long grb , while its morphology is quite similar to the one of grb0507024 which is indeed classified as a short grb @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that grb060614 has been interpreted both in the framework of the canonical fireshell model @xcite and by @xcite as a new class of intermediate sources .",
    "all these peculiarities indeed argue in favour of the rejection of this grb from the fiducial hd as a physical outlier .",
    "another interesting case is represented by grb060505 which is not associated by any sn thus suggesting it is representative of a class of objects with different progenitors . however , among the likely outliers , we also find grb030329 wich is one of spectroscopically confirmed grbs associated with a sn . however , its x - ray afterglow was observed with only two pointings of the rossi - xte instrument obtained respectivly 5 hours and 1.24 days after the burst @xcite .",
    "actually , an incomplete coverage of the x - ray lightcurve typically takes place for many grbs observed with the old missions such as beppo sax , rossi , hete2 .",
    "one can argue that the parameters obtained in these cases are somewhat uncorrectly estimated thus altering the position of the corresponding grb in the fiducial hd",
    ". this could be the case for 10 out of 13 likely ouliers grbs ( namely : 990123 , 991208 , 991216 , 990506 , 000210 , 010222 , 020813 , 020903 , 030329 , 030528 ) thus suggesting that they could be rejected because of observationally ( rather than physically ) motivated problems .",
    "as it should be clear from these comments , we have up to now only some phenomenological and qualitative hints to address the problem of outliers .",
    "we therefore deserve a detailed analysis also taking into account more quantitative features to a forthcoming publication ."
