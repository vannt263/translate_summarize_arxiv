    "recent determination of distances to high redshift type ia supernovae revealed that the universe is now expanding faster than expected .",
    "this accelerated expansion is linked with a non zero cosmological constant .",
    "since gravitational lensing of cosmological objects involves also high redshift galaxies it is interesting to extend the cosmological lens equation to cosmological models with non zero cosmological constant .",
    "+ furthermore the mass distribution in the universe at the relevant range of redshifts is clearly non homogeneous . in our considerations we will take into account the fact that at the scale up to several hundred mpc matter distribution is non homogeneous .",
    "moreover , with the advent of the next generation space telescope ( ngt ) , which will allow imaging of objects at @xmath1 ( @xcite ) , it will be possible to check better and better the influence of non homogeneities .",
    "+ using the general equations describing propagation of light in a given spacetime we derive an equation for the angular diameter distance and we extend the notion of angular diameter distance to two objects at arbitrary redshifts .",
    "the general equation for the angular diameter distance , the so called dyer - roeder equation , can be exactly solved also in the case when the cosmological constant is different from zero . however , the exact solution is very complicated and therefore not useful for practical applications . we propose a simple analytic form of an approximate solution",
    ". the approximate form of the angular diameter distance depends on four arbitrary parameters .",
    "we fix the values of these parameters by fitting this form to the exact solution .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath2 we present the derivation of the angular diameter distance in an arbitrary friedman- robertson- walker cosmological model . to take into account the non homogeneous distribution of matter , following the standard practice",
    ", we introduce a constant phenomenological parameter @xmath0 and rewrite the final equation in a few different forms . in section",
    "@xmath3 we present exact analytic solutions for the angular diameter distance , first in a flat universe and then in the general case of arbitrary spatial curvature .",
    "section @xmath4 is devoted to the approximate solution and to discussions of the fitting procedure used to determine the values of arbitrary parameters .",
    "discussion of our results is presented in section @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider a beam of light emanating from a source s. the light rays propagate along a surface @xmath6 which is determined by the eikonal equation @xmath7 a light ray is identified with a null geodesic on @xmath6 with the tangent vector @xmath8 . the light rays in the beam can be described by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an affine parameter and @xmath11 ( a=1 , 2 , 3 ) are three parameters specifying different rays .",
    "the tangent vector field to the light ray congruence , @xmath12 , determines two optical scalars , the expansion @xmath13 and the shear @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a complex vector spanning the spacelike 2-space ( the screen space ) orthogonal to @xmath17 @xmath18 ( actually the vorticity connected with the light beam is zero in all our considerations , therefore in our case these two scalars completely characterize the congruence ) .",
    "these two optical scalars describe the relative rate of change of an infinitesimal area a of the cross section of the beam of light rays and its distortion .",
    "in particular @xmath19 these two optical scalars satisfy the sachs ( @xcite ) propagation equations @xmath20 and @xmath21 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath10 , @xmath22 is the ricci tensor , and @xmath23 is the weyl tensor . equations ( [ eq : raysachs1 ] ) and ( [ eq : raysachs2 ] ) follow from the ricci identity .",
    "we will use these equations to study propagation of light in the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime .",
    "the frw spacetime is conformally flat , so in such spacetimes @xmath24 . from equation ( [ eq : raysachs2 ] )",
    "it follows that if initially the shear of the null ray congruence is equal to zero than it is always zero . therefore assuming that the light beam emanating from the source s has vanishing shear we can disregard the shear parameter altogether . using ( [ eq : opscal2 ] ) we can rewrite equation ( [ eq : raysachs1 ] ) in the form @xmath25    an observer moving with the 4-velocity vector @xmath26 will be associated with the light ray circular frequency @xmath27 .",
    "different observers will assign different frequencies to the same light ray .",
    "the shift of frequencies as measured by an observer comoving with the sources and an arbitrary observer is related to the redshift by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the frequency measured by the distant observer . differentiating this equation with respect to the affine parameter @xmath30",
    "we obtain @xmath31    since the angular diameter distance d is proportional to @xmath32 we can rewrite equation ( [ eq : raysachs3 ] ) using d instead of @xmath32 and at the same time we replace the affine parameter @xmath30 by the redshift @xmath33 , we obtain @xmath34 where we used the einstein equations to replace the ricci tensor by the energy - momentum tensor .    to relate a solution of ( [ eq : angdiam2 ] ) with the distance it has to satisfy the following initial conditions : @xmath35    to be able to use solutions of the eq .",

    "we have included the effects of non homogeneous distribution of matter which are described by a phenomenological parameter @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately at the moment there are no generally accepted models that describe the distribution of baryonic and dark matter at high redshifts and therefore the influence of non homogeneities of matter distribution can be included only at this approximate level .",
    "following the standard procedure ( @xcite ) we use the dyer - roeder distance to find the distance between two objects with redshifts @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    to find the general solution we slightly enlarged the parameter space by considering the non zero cosmological constant , so the cosmological model is described by the following parameters @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 $ ] ( not completely clumpy universe ) , @xmath68 ( no radiation ) .",
