    "high energy heavy ion collision experiments carried out at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and cern lhc have achieved the creation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase , thus liberating the quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "unexpectedly , however , the produced qgp medium showed the property close to that of a perfect fluid .",
    "this fact leads us to the understanding that the qgp produced in the energy - region of the bnl rhic is a strongly interacting system of quarks and gluons , namely , the strongly coupled qgp ( sqgp )  @xcite . with this finding",
    ", properties of a thermal quasi - particle in the qgp phase attracted our interest once again .",
    "up to now , most of the theoretical findings on thermal quasifermion in the qgp are obtained through the analyses with the assumption of weakly coupled qgp at high temperature , i.e. , analyses through the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) resummed effective perturbation calculation@xcite , or those through the one - loop calculation by replacing the thermal gluon with the massive vector boson  @xcite .",
    "such analyses , however , can not be justified in studying the thermal quasiparticle in the sqgp created in the energy region of bnl rhic , requiring us to perform nonperturbative studies .",
    "calculations of correlators within lattice qcd are performed in euclidean space and give interesting results  @xcite . however , strictly speaking it is not possible to carry out an analytic continuation that is necessary to determine the spectral function .",
    "in addition it is difficult on the lattice to respect the chiral symmetry that should be restored in the sqgp phase , though we are interested in the property of thermal quasiparticle in the chiral symmetric sqgp phase .    in this paper",
    "we perform a nonperturbative analysis of thermal quasifermion in a thermal qcd / qed by studying its self - energy function through the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) with the htl resummed improved ladder kernel .",
    "our analysis may overcome the problems in the previous analyses listed above for the following reasons : ( 1 ) it is a nonperturbative qcd / qed analysis , ( 2 ) we study the dse in the real - time formalism of thermal field theory , which is suitable for the direct calculation of the propagator , or the spectral function , ( 3 ) we use the htl resummed thermal gauge boson ( gluon / photon ) propagator as an interaction kernel of the dse , and take into account the quasiparticle decay processes by accurately studying the imaginary part of the self - energy function , and finally , ( 4 ) we present an analysis based on the dse that respects the chiral symmetry and describes its dynamical breaking and restoration .",
    "our analysis is nothing but an application of our formalism employing the dse to the study of thermal quasi - femion on the strongly coupled qcd / qed medium with chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "analogous studies employing the dse are carried out by several groups  @xcite .",
    "all these analyses solve the dse in the imaginary - time formalism , and try to perform an analytic continuation .",
    "harada et al .",
    "study the dse with a ladder kernel in which the vertex function and gauge boson propagator are replaced with the tree level quantities , while qin et al . and mueller et al . use the maximum entropy method to compute the quark spectral density .",
    "our analysis reveals several interesting results , some of which may force us to change the image of thermal quasifermion : ( 1 ) while the thermal mass of a quasifermion begins to decrease , the strength of the coupling gets stronger and finally disappears in the strong coupling region , thus showing a property of a massless particle , ( 2 ) its imaginary part ( i.e. , the decay width ) persists to have @xmath1 behavior .",
    "these results suggest that in the recently produced strongly coupled qgp , the thermal mass of a quasifermion should vanish .    in the present paper",
    ", we report the results of the analysis by focusing mainly on the behavior of chiral invariant thermal mass and its imaginary part in the strongly coupled gauge theories . full results on properties of the thermal quasifermion will be given in a separate paper  @xcite .",
    "the retarded quasifermion propagator @xmath3 , is expressed by @xmath4 where @xmath2 is the quasifermion self - energy function that is tensor decomposed in a chiral symmetric phase at finite temperature as follows : @xmath5 @xmath6 is the inverse of the fermion wave function renormalization function , and @xmath7 is the chiral invariant mass function .",
    "the c - number mass function does not appear in the chiral symmetric phase .",
    "as for the interaction kernel of the dse , we use the tree vertex and the htl resummed gauge boson propagator , and get the htl resummed improved ladder dse to determine the scalar invariants @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "the htl resummed effective perturbation analysis enables us to study thermal physics of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we expect that the nonperturbative analysis employing the dse with the htl resummed dressed kernel at least takes into account the important effects of thermal fluctuations up to @xmath14 , and enables us to give reliable solutions over wider range of couplings and temperatures , i.e. , the region @xmath15 .    in the chiral symmetric phase the fermion propagator can be expressed as @xmath16\\ ] ] where @xmath17 with @xmath18 & = &   - \\mbox{re } [ d_-(-p_0 , p ) ] , \\\\",

    "2 we show only the fermion branch .",
    "though in the weak coupling region we get the solution in good agreement with the htl resummed perturbation analyses , as the coupling becomes stronger from the intermediate to the strong coupling region , the normalized thermal mass @xmath35 begins to decrease from 1 and finally tends to zero ( in the region @xmath36 in fig .  2 ) .",
    "namely , in the thermal qcd / qed medium , the thermal mass of the quasifermion begins to decrease as the strength of the coupling gets stronger and finally disappears in the strong coupling region .",
    "this fact suggests that in the recently produced strongly coupled qgp , the thermal mass of the quasifermion should vanish or at least become significantly lighter compared to the value in the weakly coupled qgp .",
    "dependence of the normalized thermal mass @xmath37 ( see the text for details).,width=283 ]    to see the above behavior of the thermal mass more clearly , in fig .",
    "3 we show the normalized thermal mass @xmath37 as a function of @xmath33 . in the small coupling region ( @xmath38 ) around the temperature range @xmath39 , results of the thermal mass agree well with those of the htl resummed perturbation calculation .",
    "the thermal mass @xmath40 decreases and finally vanishes as the coupling gets stronger from the intermediate to the strong coupling region .",
    "analogous behavior of the thermal mass @xmath40 appears in the temperature dependence  @xcite .",
    "dependence of re[@xmath41 at @xmath34.,width=283 ]    this behavior of the thermal mass is determined by the behavior of the chiral invariant mass function re[@xmath42 . in fig .",
    "4 we show the @xmath43 dependence of re[@xmath41 at @xmath34 . at small coupling re[@xmath41",
    "has a steep valley / peak structure in the small @xmath43 region , but as the coupling becomes stronger this structure eventually disappears and re[@xmath41 begins to behave almost as a straight line .",
    "the thermal mass is given by the solution of re[@xmath44=@xmath45 , which is the @xmath43 coordinate of the intersection point of the drawn curve of re[@xmath44 and the straight solid line through the origin with a slope -1 in fig .",
    "at first we can see with this figure that at small coupling there are three intersection points : the one with positive @xmath43 , one with negative @xmath43 , and one at @xmath46 , which corresponds to the quasifermion , the plasmino , and the massless ( or , ultrasoft ) modes  @xcite , respectively . as the coupling becomes stronger ( @xmath36 at @xmath34 )",
    ", however , there is only one intersection point at @xmath46 , representing the massless pole in the fermion propagator .",
    "thus we can understand the behavior in fig .",
    "3 ; namely , @xmath35 is unity in the weak coupling region , and zero in the strong coupling region ( @xmath36 at @xmath34 ) ; therefore , the fermion thermal mass vanishes completely in the corresponding strong coupling region .",
    "the quasifermion and the plasmino modes are well understood in the htl resummed analyses , the latter being the collective mode to appear in the thermal environment . what is the third mode ? is it nothing but evidence of the massless , or the ultrasoft mode ?",
    "is there any signature in our analysis ?    to clarify this question , in fig .",
    "5(a ) we give the spectral density @xmath47 in the small coupling region ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "two sharp peaks , representing the quasifermion and the plasmino poles , are clearly seen , and the existence of a slight `` peak '' can also be recognized around @xmath49 . to see this more clearly , in fig .",
    "5b we show the rescaled version of fig .  5a , where we can clearly see the peak structure around @xmath46 .",
    "this third peak is nothing but convincing evidence of the existence of a massless or an ultrasoft mode in the weak coupling region  @xcite .",
    "this peak is indistinctively slight compared to the sharp quasifermion / plasmino peak .",
    "this problem will be fully discussed in a separate paper  @xcite .     in the small coupling region ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "( b ) quasifermion spectral density @xmath47 enlarged around the origin.,width=283 ]     in the small coupling region ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "( b ) quasifermion spectral density @xmath47 enlarged around the origin.,width=272 ]",
    "finally let us see the imaginary part of the chiral invariant mass function im[@xmath42 .",
    "the decay width of the quasifermion is extensively studied through the htl resummed effective perturbation calculation  @xcite , giving a gauge invariant result of @xmath1 . however , as is shown above , the quasiparticle exhibits an unexpected behavior , such as the vanishing of the thermal mass in the strongly coupled qcd / qed medium , completely different from that expected from the htl resummed effective perturbation analyses . how does the decay width of the quasifermion exhibit its property in the corresponding strongly coupled qcd / qed medium ?    in fig .",
    "6 we show the im[@xmath50 in the small coupling region , which agrees with the htl resummed calculation  @xcite up to a numerical factor . in fig .",
    "7 we show im[@xmath51 in the strong coupling region .    ] in the small coupling qgp.,width=283 ]    ] in the strongly coupled qcd / qed medium.,width=283 ]    as can be seen , even in the strong coupling region , im[@xmath10 ] or the decay width shows the same behavior of @xmath1 ; the numerical factor , of course , largely differs from that in the small coupling region .",
    "this behavior is again not expected , because the quasifermion in the small coupling qgp and the one in the strong coupling qgp are totally different ; while in the former case the quasifermion has a thermal mass of @xmath14 and the plasmino branch exists in a fermion dispersion law , in the latter case the thermal mass of the quasifermion vanishes and the plasmino branch disappears .",
    "in this paper , through the analysis employing the htl resummed improved ladder dse , we disclose the fact that the property of the thermal quasifermion in the strongly coupled qcd / qed medium largely differs from that expected from the analyses based on the htl resummed effective perturbation calculations .",
    "we can summarize our main result as follows . in the strongly coupled qcd / qed medium , ( i ) while the thermal mass of the quasifermion vanishes and the quasifermion pole starts to behave as a massless pole , ( ii ) the imaginary part of the chiral invariant mass function , or the decay width of the quasifermion persists to have the behavior of @xmath1 , which is expected in the small coupling and high temperature qcd / qed medium .",
    "the first result suggests that in the recently produced sqgp the thermal mass of the quasifermion should vanish or at least become significantly lighter compared to the value in the weakly coupled qgp .",
    "and the second result indicates that in the sqgp the massless or the ultrasoft fermion pole may not be observed as a massless quasifermion mode due to its large imaginary part .",
