    "since the landmark discovery that rna molecules can act as enzymes ,  @xcite an increasing repertoire of cellular functions has been associated with rna , raising the need to understand how these complex molecules fold into elaborate tertiary structures . in response to this challenge , great strides have been made in describing rna folding@xcite .",
    "single molecule and ensemble experiments using a variety of biophysical methods , combined with theoretical techniques , have led to a conceptual framework for interpreting the thermodynamics and kinetics of rna folding  @xcite . despite these advances , there are very few reliable structural models with the ability to quantitatively predict the thermodynamic properties of rna ( see , however , refs .",
    "the development of simple and accurate models is complicated by the interplay of several energy and length scales , which arise from stacking , hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions .",
    "although multiple interactions contribute to the stability of rna , the most vexing of these are the electrostatic interactions , since the negatively charged phosphate groups make rna a strongly charged polyelectrolyte .",
    "@xcite because of the strong intramolecular coulomb repulsion , the magnitude of the charge on the phosphate groups has to be reduced in order for rna molecules to fold .",
    "the softening of repulsion between the phosphate groups requires the presence of counterions .",
    "a number of factors such as the debye length , the bjerrum length , the number of nucleotides in rna , as well as the size , valence and shape of counterions  @xcite modulate electrostatic interactions , which further complicates the prediction of rna folding thermodynamics .    in principle , all - atom simulations of rna in water provide a straightforward route to computing rna folding thermodynamics .",
    "however , uncertainties in nucleic acid force fields and the difficulty in obtaining adequate conformational sampling have prevented routine use of all - atom simulations to study the folding of even small rna molecules . at the same time , the success of using polyelectrolyte theories@xcite and simulations@xcite in capturing many salient features of rna folding justifies the development of coarse - grained ( cg ) models .",
    "none of the existing cg models of rna , which have been remarkably successful in a variety of applications ,  @xcite have been used to reproduce folding thermodynamics over a wide range of ion concentrations and temperature . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a force field based on a cg model in which each nucleotide is represented by three interactions sites ( tis )  a phosphate , a sugar and a base@xcite .",
    "the tis force field includes stacking , hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions that are known to contribute significantly to the stability of rna structures .",
    "we obtain the thermodynamic parameters for the stacking and hydrogen bond interactions by matching the simulation and experimental melting data for various nucleotide dimers and for the pseudoknot from mouse mammary tumor virus ( mmtv pk in figure ) .",
    "our description of the electrostatic interactions in rna relies on the concept of counterion condensation , which posits that counterions condense onto the sugar - phosphate backbone and partially reduce the charge on each phosphate group .",
    "our simulations provide a way to determine the magnitude of the reduced backbone charge by fitting the experimental data for the ion - dependent stability of rna hairpins ( l8 and l10 in figure ) .",
    "remarkably , experimental data on folding thermodynamics of the mmtv pk , l8 , and l10 are reproduced well over a wide range of temperatures and concentrations of monovalent salt using a single set of force field parameters . our cg force field is transferable , and hence can be adopted for other rna molecules as well .",

    "the wca potential is computationally efficient because it vanishes exactly beyond the contact distance @xmath18 . to allow close approach between two bases that stack flat one on top of another , we assume @xmath19 and @xmath20 kcal / mol for the interacting sites representing bases . with the exception of stacked bases",
    ", this choice of parameters underestimates the distance of closest approach between coarse - grained rna groups .",

    "the model correctly describes the overall shape of the melting curve , including two peaks that indicate the melting transitions of the two stems .",
    "stem 1 in the mmtv pk is comprised entirely of g@xmath14c base pairs ( figure ) and , despite being shorter than stem 2 , melts at a higher temperature .",
    "although the melting temperature of stem 2 is reproduced very accurately in simulation , the melting temperature of stem 1 is somewhat underestimated , 89 @xmath0c instead of 95 @xmath0c .",
    "we speculate that the failure to precisely reproduce both peaks is due to inaccurate estimates of the stacking parameters @xmath31 at high temperatures .",
    "in addition to several approximations involved in the derivation of @xmath31 , the experimental data that were used in this derivation were obtained at 37 @xmath0c or below .",
    "the approximation that enthalpies and entropies are constant may not be accurate for large temperature extrapolations .",
    "it is therefore expected that the agreement between experiment and simulation will be compromised at high temperatures .    in the rest of the paper we set @xmath106 kcal / mol and @xmath200 kcal / mol . since the magnitude of the backbone charge",
    "could not be determined at high salt concentration , we will analyse the measurements of hairpin stability that cover a wide range of @xmath135 .",
    "in this analysis we assume that @xmath140 is given by eq .",
    "( ) , with @xmath142 constant .      to estimate the reduced phosphate charge @xmath140 , we have computed the stabilities @xmath201 of hairpins l8 and l10 ( figure ) for different values of @xmath142 in eq .",
    "we use these hairpins as benchmarks because their folding enthalpies and entropies have been measured over a wide range of @xmath135 , from 0.02 m to 1 m na@xmath195 .",
    "the experimental @xmath201 of l8 and l10 increase linearly with @xmath202 for @xmath203 m , but the extrapolation of this linear dependence to @xmath204 m does not yield the measured stabilities at 1 m salt ( figure ) .",
    "in addition , the measured stability of l10 at 1 m is disproportionately larger than that of l8 .",
    "for these reasons , we use 0.11 m as a reference salt concentration @xmath205 , instead of usual 1 m , and compare simulation and experiment in terms of relative stabilities @xmath206 .",
    "the simulation model reproduces correctly the linear dependence of @xmath207 on @xmath202 , @xmath208 for @xmath203 m. it also predicts an upward curvature of @xmath209 for @xmath204 m ( figure ) .",
    "we find that @xmath147 yields the best fit between the simulation and experimental values of @xmath210 .",
    "note that , although the stability of rna hairpins decreases sharply with temperature , the salt dependence of @xmath92 is mostly insensitive to @xmath88 ( figure ) . the linear slope in eq .",
    "( ) does not change with temperature in experiment and simulation .",
    "an uncertainty in the analysis of the l8 and l10 data comes from the 5-pppg , which is subject to hydrolysis in solution . the total number of phosphates @xmath211 may vary from 20 to 22 in l8 and from 22 to 24 in l10 .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) in figure show @xmath207 for the hairpins with charge @xmath122 , @xmath212 or @xmath213 at the 5-end for @xmath214 @xmath0c and @xmath215 ( @xmath147 ) . apparently , the charge of a terminal nucleotide has a strong influence on the hairpin stability . for dna duplexes ,",
    "the value of @xmath210 was shown to increase linearly with the total number of phosphates in the duplex , @xmath216 this formula assumes implicitly that all phosphates contribute equally to the duplex stability .",
    "we find that for short rna hairpins , such as l8 and l10 , the end effects are significantly greater than @xmath217 . in figure , @xmath218 for l8 with @xmath219 and @xmath220 for l10 with @xmath221 .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath222 shifts towards its value in eq .",
    "( ) with increasing the hairpin length .",
    "although the experimental scatter in figure can be attributed to partial hydrolysis of the 5-pppg , it is hard to establish the precise contribution of this effect .",
    "therefore , we fix @xmath147 , which was obtained assuming no hydrolysis of the 5-pppg .    at @xmath223 m ,",
    "the simulation model predicts @xmath224 @xmath0c for the melting temperature of l8 and @xmath225 kcal / mol for its stability at 37 @xmath0c .",
    "the corresponding experimental values are @xmath226 @xmath0c and @xmath227 kcal / mol at 37 @xmath0c .",
    "for l10 , we have @xmath228 @xmath0c , @xmath229 kcal / mol in simulation and @xmath230 @xmath0c , @xmath231 kcal / mol in experiment .",
    "both hairpins are found to be less stable in simulation than in experiment .",
    "predictions of hairpin stability at 1 m salt , using the nearest neighbor model with stacking parameters from ref .",
    "29 , underestimate the melting temperatures and stabilities of l8 and l10 by a comparable amount .",
    "this suggests that some additional structuring may occur in the loops of these hairpins , which is not taken into account in theoretical models .",
    "although our simulations account for possible base stacking in the loops , we do not consider any hydrogen bonds other than the six watson - crick base pairs in the hairpin stem ( figure ) .",
    "it is possible that bases in the loops of l8 and l10 form additional hydrogen bonds , since these loops are relatively large .",
    "figure compares the experimental heat capacity of the mmtv pk@xcite at 50 mm k@xmath195 to the result obtained in simulation with @xmath232 m in eq .",
    "it is not obvious _ a priori _ that hairpins and pseudoknots should have the same reduced charge @xmath140 .",
    "pseudoknot structures consist of three aligned strands of rna , rather than two , and the high density of negative charge would be expected to promote counterion condensation .",
    "nonetheless we find that the heat capacity of the mmtv pk computed using @xmath147 , which was established for hairpins , matches the experiment well ( figure b ) .",
    "adjusting a single parameter @xmath142 was sufficient to position correctly both melting peaks , an indication that eq .",
    "( ) is suitable for a description of salt effects on rna pseudoknots .",
    "the model also captures the characteristic property of the mmtv pk , that is , stem 2 is more strongly affected by changes in @xmath135 than stem 1 . in experiment@xcite ,",
    "the difference in the melting temperatures of the two stems increases from 22 @xmath0c at @xmath197 m to 32 @xmath0c at @xmath232 m , which is related to a significant loss of stability for stem 2 in the low salt buffer .",
    "note that neglecting counterion condensation ( @xmath145 ) overestimates electrostatic repulsions between phosphates , rendering both stems significantly less stable in simulation than in experiment ( figure a ) .",
    "in particular , the melting transition of stem 2 shifts to 4 @xmath0c , in stark contrast to the experimental melting temperature of 48 @xmath0c .    a considerable difference in the stability of the two stems in the mmtv pk is further illustrated in figure , where we plot the probability that each stem is folded as a function of @xmath135 . at 37 @xmath0c ,",
    "stem 1 is stable for all salt concentrations in the typical experimental range , whereas stem 2 undergoes a folding transition upon increasing @xmath135 , with the midpoint at approximately 30 mm ( figure a ) . at 80 @xmath0c",
    ", the folding transition of stem 1 falls within the experimental range of @xmath135 ( figure b ) .",
    "however , at such high temperatures , the population of the unfolded state is non - negligible for all salt concentrations and , in the case of stem 2 , it exceeds 80% .    in figure , we have used two different criteria for folding of the stems . for the solid curves",
    "a stem is considered folded if at least five base pairs have formed and for the dashed curves a stem is assumed to be folded if at least one base pair has formed . although the curves in figure depend on the criteria for folding , the numerical differences are small , especially at 37 @xmath0c .",
    "this is because the transition state in the folding of each stem corresponds to the closing of a loop by a single base pair , after which the formation of subsequent base pairs is a highly cooperative process . at 80 @xmath0c , individual base pairs",
    "have a high probability of opening and closing without affecting the loop region , which contributes to the quantitative differences between the two definitions of the folded state ( figure b ) .",
    "we have developed a general coarse - grained simulation model that reproduces the folding thermodynamics of rna hairpins and pseudoknots with good accuracy .",
    "the model enables us to study the folding / unfolding transitions with computational efficiency , as a function of temperature and ionic strength of the buffer .",
    "it is interesting that simulations using a single choice of model parameters , @xmath106 kcal / mol , @xmath200 kcal / mol and @xmath147 , show detailed agreement with available experimental data for the three rna molecules in monovalent salt buffers .",
    "although we have established the success of the model with applications to a few rna molecules , the methodology is general and we expect that the proposed force field can be used to study rna with even more complex structures .",
    "applications of the model to other rna molecules will be reported in a separate publication .    on the basis of the good agreement between simulations and experiments",
    "we conclude that , for @xmath233 m , the effects of monovalent salt on rna stability can be attributed to the polyelectrolyte effect . at @xmath234 m ,",
    "the results are more ambiguous both in experiment and simulation .",
    "there is mixed experimental evidence as to whether the linear dependence of the rna stability on @xmath202 extends all the way to 1 m ( cf .",
    "l8 and l10 in figure ) .",
    "our simulations predict a substantial curvature in @xmath207 vs. @xmath202 in the range @xmath234 m ( figure ) , where the debye - hckel approximation is likely to be less accurate . however , the melting profile of the mmtv pk obtained in simulations at 1 m is in good agreement with experiment ( figure ) . due to insufficient experimental data ,",
    "it is hard to establish the extent to which simulations and experiments disagree at @xmath234 m.    we find that , both for the hairpins and pseudoknots in monovalent salt solutions , the reduction in the magnitude of the backbone charge due to counterion condensation is given by eq .",
    "( ) with @xmath147 .",
    "this result is particularly interesting since folded pseudoknots have a higher density of backbone packing than folded hairpins . in counterion condensation theory of rod - like polyelectrolytes ,",
    "the parameter @xmath142 is the mean axial distance per unit bare charge of the polyelectrolyte .",
    "notably , distance 4.4 agrees well with the estimates of the counterion condensation theory for @xmath142 in single - stranded nucleic acids  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we propose that , in our simulations , @xmath142 describes the geometry of the unfolded state , which is similarly flexible for hairpins and pseudoknots .",
