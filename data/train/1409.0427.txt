    "[ 8]-[9 ] of chakrabarty 1998 ) which depends on the irradiating luminosity ( @xmath20 ) , the source distance ( @xmath21 ) , the radius of the companion star ( @xmath22 ) , the albedo of the star ( @xmath23 ) and the binary separation ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we fitted the data by using @xmath20 as a free parameter and fixing @xmath25 pc ( deller et al .",
    "2012 ) , @xmath26 ( archibald et al . 2009 ) and @xmath27 .",
    "the binary separation @xmath28^{1/3}$ ] was obtained by fixing @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( deller et al .",
    "we modelled the shock front component with a simple power law , by leaving free to vary the normalization and the power law index .",
    "the best fit is obtained for @xmath31 erg s@xmath17 , consistent with the estimated dipole spin - down luminosity of the ms radio pulsar ( @xmath32 \\times 10^{34}{\\rm \\ erg \\ ; s^{-1}}$ ] ; archibald et al .",
    "however , such model provides a rather poor fit to the data , particularly in the uv region ( @xmath33 for 10 d.o.f . ; see fig .",
    "[ sed ] , left - hand panel ) .    to check for a more realistic solution , we tried to fit our data by adding to the model the contribution of an irradiated accretion disc by using @xmath20 and the internal disc radius ( @xmath34 ) as free parameters ( eqs .",
    "[ 10]-[15 ] of chakrabarty 1998 ) .",
    "we fixed the x - ray albedo of the disc to 0.95 ( chakrabarty 1998 ) and the mass transfer rate to 10@xmath35 yr@xmath17 , as predicted by verbunt ( 1993 ) for a short - period x - ray binary with a main - sequence companion star and where the mass transfer is kept going by loss of angular momentum from the system .",
    "for each possible radius @xmath34 , we assumed an outer disc radius of @xmath36 ( where @xmath24 is the binary separation ) .",
    "the fit improves ( @xmath37 with respect to the star plus shock model ; see fig . [",
    "sed ] , right - hand panel ) and we obtain an acceptable solution for @xmath38 erg s@xmath17 and an inner radius for the emitting region @xmath39 cm .",
    "more sophisticated models are beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "millisecond radio pulsars in binary systems can interact with the companion star if the orbital separation is small enough . in recent years",
    "an increasing number of the so - called spider radio pulsars have been discovered ( see roberts 2011 for a review ) , following the first discoveries of the redback psr j1740 - 5340 in the globular cluster ngc 6397 ( with a non - degenerate companion , damico et al .",
    "2001 ) and the black widow psr b1957 + 20 ( with a brown dwarf companion , reynolds et al .",
    "the interaction between the relativistic pulsar wind and matter outflowing from the companion can give rise to different geometries depending on the relative strengths of the two components .",
    "in the case of a strong relativistic wind ( high pressure ) , matter outflowing from the companion is pushed in a narrow cometary tail around it , as in the case of psr b1957 + 20 . in the case of a weaker relativistic pulsar wind ( or strong matter pressure )",
    "more extended patterns can be obtained , giving rise to extensive eclipses of the radio signal during the orbital period .",
    "a further case has been envisaged by tavani ( 1991 ) , where a large amount of matter is outflowing from the companion , completely engulfing the radio pulsar . in this regime",
    "the radio pulsar is still active , but its signal is completely undetectable in the radio band due to the high free  free absorption .",
    "arons & tavani ( 1993 ) developed the theory of high - energy emission by the relativistic shock produced by the pulsar wind in the nebula surrounding the binary and by the shock constraining the mass outflow from the companion star .",
    "particularly compelling to j1023 is the case of psr b125963 .",
    "this is a millisecond pulsar orbiting a high mass be companion in a very eccentric orbit .",
    "far from the companion , the x - ray emission is dominated by shock - powered high - energy emission produced by the interaction between the relativistic wind from the pulsar and matter outflowing from the companion .",
    "the spectrum is described by a hard power law with @xmath40 , extending up to 200 kev ( and more ) as detected with compton / osse ( grove et al .",
    "1995 ) . during its orbital evolution",
    ", the pulsar disappears close to periastron . during the passage",
    "an increase in luminosity and a softening of the power law @xmath41 are observed ( tavani & arons 1997 ) . a change to a propeller regime has been excluded ( campana et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "three characteristic radii define the fate of matter falling on to a magnetized , fast spinning neutron star : the magnetospheric radius , @xmath42 ( where the incoming matter pressure balances the magnetic dipole pressure ) , the corotation radius , @xmath43 ( where matter in keplerian orbit corotates with the neutron star ) , and the light cylinder radius , @xmath44 ( where field lines attached to the neutron star rotate at the speed of light ) .",
    "the last two radii depend only on the neutron star spin and in the case of j1023 their values are @xmath45 km ( for a neutron star mass of @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 km .",
    "the magnetospheric radius depends on the neutron star magnetic field and on the mass inflow rate .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the mass accretion rate on to the magnetosphere in units of @xmath50 g s@xmath17 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the neutron star mass and radius in units of @xmath46 and 10 km , respectively , and @xmath53 is the magnetic field normalized to @xmath54 g ( perna , bozzo & stella 2006 ) .",
    "due to the inclination of the magnetic moment with respect to the rotation axis , the magnetospheric radius can be larger up to a factor 1.5 ( perna et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the magnetic field of j1023 has been estimated to be @xmath55 g ( archibald et al . 2013 ) .",
    "depending on the mass inflow rate , matter can reach the neutron star surface ( @xmath56 , accretion powered ) , be halted or strongly reduced at the neutron star magnetosphere by the propeller mechanism ( @xmath57 , still accretion powered ) or be ejected by the pulsar pressure ( @xmath58 , spin - down powered ) .",
    "these regimes occur for lower and lower mass accretion rates .",
    "when a radio pulsar reactivates it is more difficult to quench it .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the mass inflow pressure has overcome the radiation pulsar pressure throughout the binary separation ( campana et al .",
    "1998 ; burderi et al .",
    "this is why it is so difficult to quench a fast spinning millisecond radio pulsar when it reactivates .",
    "it is not easy to account for the minimal luminosity needed to quench j1023 .",
    "following burderi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we can estimate a quenching luminosity of @xmath59 .",
    "this is much larger than the observed x - ray luminosities and would suggest that the radio pulsar is still active , but unobservable .",
    "we note that a propeller model has been proposed to explain the emission characteristics of xss j12270 - 4859 ( papitto , torres & li 2014 ) and such model may apply to j1023 in its current state as well . in this model",
    "the power law emission is interpreted as resulting from synchrotron emission at the interface between the disc and the magnetosphere .",
    "based on energetic grounds , this model is slightly disfavoured by the data , despite the appealing feature of easily explaining the presence of a ( truncated ) accretion disc .",
    "the minimum luminosity expected in the propeller regime is obtained when the magnetospheric radius is close to the light cylinder radius . in the case of j1023 ,",
    "this luminosity is @xmath60 erg s@xmath17 , whereas the maximum luminosity expected in the propeller regime is @xmath61 erg s@xmath17 .",
    "the observed mean x - ray luminosity is @xmath62 erg s@xmath17 and during the flare it rises to @xmath63 erg s@xmath17 .",
    "by contrast the full spin - down luminosity is@xmath64 erg s@xmath17 based on _ nustar _ data , tendulkar et al .",
    "( 2014 ) estimated an average value for the x - ray luminosity which is close to the minimum luminosity expected in the propeller regime , whereas the peak luminosity should be in the propeller luminosity interval .",
    "in this work we presented the results of 51 _ swift _ xrt and uvot observations of the binary millisecond radio pulsar psr j1023 + 0038 carried out in the 2013 october2014 may period and the results of optical and nir photometry and optical spectroscopy of this system .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of j1023 is best modelled by an absorbed power law , with a column density of @xmath65 @xmath66 and a photon index @xmath67 .",
    "the contribution from any possible soft component is negligible and no iron line features can be detected .",
    "spectral changes can be accounted for by changes of the power law normalization alone .",
    "these observational features are consistent with shock - powered emission produced by the pulsar / outflow interaction ( tavani & arons 1997 ) and with the enshrouding of j1023 by a large amount of matter , material which is however not enough to quench the radio pulsar .",
    "the enshrouding is testified by the mild increase in the column density and by the softening of the power law photon index compared to the previous quiescent period ( archibald et al .",
    "2010 ; bogdanov et al .",
    "2011 ) : the former rose from * @xmath68 * to @xmath69 @xmath66 , the latter changed from @xmath70 to @xmath67 ( tavani & arons 1997 ) . at the end of 2014 february",
    ", x - ray flares were detected , with a 0.310 kev luminosity of @xmath71 ( a factor @xmath72 higher than the average x - ray luminosity ) .",
    "the peak luminosity of j1023 during flaring is large , encompassing a sizeable fraction of the spin - down luminosity and thus leaving open the possibility for emission in the propeller state ( papitto et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the shock - powered emission scenario can be well reconciled with both the reported switch off in the radio band and the increase in the gamma - ray emission . according to this ,",
    "the radio pulsar signal is completely shielded by scattering and/or free  free absorption by a large amount of outflowing matter , whereas the increase in the gamma ",
    "ray emission can be naturally explained in terms of an enhancement of the shock emission ( archibald et al .",
    "2013 ; patruno et al .",
    "2014 ; stappers et al . 2014 ;",
    "takata et al . 2014 ; tendulkar et al . 2014 ) .",
    "a strong correlation is found between the x - ray and the uv count rates in the 2013 november 6 - 19 period both on time - scales of days and of a few tens of seconds , thus suggesting that the same emission mechanism is powering part of the x - ray and uv emission .",
    "optical and infrared photometric observations show that the companion star is irradiated by the spin - down emission of the radio pulsar , but also suggest that other emission mechanisms must be at work .",
    "in fact , double - peaked emission lines in the optical spectra indicate that an accretion disc exists around the system , as shown also from multi - wavelength observations perfomed since 2013 june ( patruno et al . 2014 ; stappers et al .",
    "2014 ; takata et al . 2014 ; tendulkar et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the peak separation of the horns of the emission lines is @xmath73 km s@xmath17 .",
    "this value is consistent with those reported by halpern et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , takata et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and linares et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , suggesting that the disc thickness has not changed significantly between 2013 october and december .",
    "the sed from the nir to the x - ray band is well represented by a model consisting of an irradiated companion , an accretion disc and a shock emission .",
    "the sed reveals a minimal contribution of the disc to the x - ray emission and may indicate that accretion on to the neutron star is not occurring ( see also the sed reported by takata et al .",
    "in fact , this is what is expected in order not to completely quench the pulsar mechanism and thus the relativistic wind .",
    "the sed also shows that more than half of the uv emission ( @xmath74 per cent fractional contribution to the total flux ) is emitted from the accretion disc , with the remaining part arising from the intra - binary shock ( @xmath75 per cent ) .",
    "the modelling of the sed allowed us to estimate the inner radius of the emitting region ( @xmath76 @xmath77 ) , consistent with the value reported by takata et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for the inner edge of the accretion disc , and the spin - down luminosity of the radio pulsar ( @xmath38 erg s@xmath17 ) , possibly involving some shielding .",
    "if this picture is correct , the disc should not extend down to the magnetosphere , but it should be halted further outside .",
    "the disc should then be partially supported or strongly evaporated by the neutron star spin - down luminosity , as it has been suggested for some white dwarfs ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ) .",
