    "in recent years significant effort was devoted to increase the accuracy of theoretical predictions for @xmath5-@xmath5 collision processes , in order to match the experimental capabilities of the lhc detectors .",
    "one line of development aims at providing refined automatic computations of fixed - order total and differential cross - sections with increased accuracy , leading to predictions of the final products of hard - scattering processes at the parton level .",
    "a second line of development , strongly tied to the first one , relies on the combination of these results with shower algorithms , able to track the evolution of these final - state particles to hadronization . in practice , to realize the combination between hard - scattering and parton shower , different matching schemes have been proposed , depending of the order of the perturbative expansion . at nlo accuracy",
    "two methods have dominated the literature in the last ten years , the mc@nlo  @xcite and powheg  @xcite . here",
    "we make use of the latter , as implemented in the computer program ` powheg - box `  @xcite .",
    "the ` powheg - box ` provides an almost automatic and process - independent matching framework yet it requires some process - dependent input , that has to be specified by the user , process by process .",
    "thus , it offers a framework to implement the matching of new processes , once one is able to provide all required input . in case of processes of some complexity already at the parton level , e.g.  multiparticle production ,",
    "this input can be conveniently computed by external codes .",
    "our ` powhel ` package uses the ` helac - nlo ` @xcite set of codes , to provide all matrix - elements required as input by ` powheg - box ` for the computation of cross - sections at the nlo + ps accuracy for @xmath0 pair hadroproduction in association with a third particle .",
    "the output of ` powhel ` are les houches event ( lhe ) files @xcite , including events at the first radiation emission level .",
    "additional radiation emissions can be simulated by further showering these events using shower monte carlo ( smc ) programs , such as ` pythia `  @xcite and ` herwig `  @xcite .",
    "this can be done a - posteriori , since all essential process and event information needed at this purpose is already stored in the lhe files .",
    "thus the full method can be exploited to produce predictions at the nlo level , at the first radiation emission level ( lhe level ) , after parton shower ( ps ) and after ps  +  hadronization  +  hadron decay .",
    "the total cross - sections as computed from lhe events are expected to have nlo accuracy , whereas the corresponding differential distributions have formally nlo accuracy up to higher order corrections , as lhe events also include the effect of sudakov form factors embedded in the powheg formula . therefore lhe predictions , as compared to nlo ones , are very useful to check the correctness of the implementation and to understand , as well , in which phase - space regions one could expect that the effects of higher - order corrections will sensibly modify the nlo distributions . on the other hand , predictions after the full smc chain are the closest to the experimental results , allowing for an immediate comparison with the data collected in the detectors .",
    "actually , in many experiments reconstruction procedures have been developed in order to reconstruct the intermediate unstable particles , like top quarks and heavy bosons , from which the final - state products are originated ( bottom - up approach ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize however , that , once full high - accuracy simulations from the parton level down to the hadron level ( top - down approach ) are available , like in the case of ` powhel ` + smc , this reconstruction is unnecessary .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the case of @xmath0-pair hadroproduction in association with an heavy gauge boson , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , that we have recently studied extensively in ref .",
    "@xcite , leaving the reader interested in our predictions for other @xmath0-x associated processes , like @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , to previous works including ` powhel ` predictions  @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath11 lo and nlo inclusive cross - sections as predicted by ` powhel ` were already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we emphasize that these predictions follow extensive checks and comparisons to the results of previous works presented by different authors in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the basis of different methods .",
    "further predictions concerning several differential distributions at nlo and at nlo + ps accuracy were included , as for @xmath7 hadroproduction , for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively , whereas , as for @xmath12 , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our predictions use the following parameters : @xmath13 172.5 gev , @xmath14 = 80.385 gev , @xmath15  =  91.1876 gev , @xmath16 = 0.049284 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mass of the vector boson , and the ` cteq6.6 m ` pdf set available with the lhapdf interface , with a 2-loop running @xmath19 .",
    "we adopted the smc versions ` pythia-6.4.26 ` and ` herwig-6.520 ` .",
    "we enforced stability of @xmath20 in both , whereas @xmath21 stability was enforced in ` herwig ` , to match the default in ` pythia ` .",
    "all other hadrons and leptons were assumed to be stable or to decay with b.r . according to the default implementation of each smc .    when making predictions at nlo + ps accuracy , we concentrated on two different channels , the trilepton and the same - sign dilepton ones , as also recently exploited by the cms collaboration in ref .",
    "essentially , the trilepton channel selection aims at isolating the @xmath4 , decaying in @xmath22 pairs , together with the @xmath0 pair decaying semileptonically .",
    "the selection of the dilepton channel aims at isolating the @xmath23 , decaying in @xmath24 , again with the @xmath0 pair decaying semileptonically .",
    "the list of cuts we adopted for this study is extensively detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the trilepton channel , requesting the invariant mass of a pair of opposite - charge isolated leptons to be close to the @xmath4 mass ,",
    "the contribution of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is suppressed with respect to the contribution of @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1].a .",
    "the invariant mass of the reconstructed @xmath4 after cuts is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2].a , by cumulating the results of the three processes .",
    "pairs of opposite charge leptons , emitted by heavy particle decays , turned out to be quite insensitive to smc effects , allowing for a good reconstruction of heavy objects .",
    "this opens good perspectives for the study , in the trilepton channel , of even other neutral boson candidates , like an exotic @xmath27 . even if further photon emissions from the emitted leptons smear the @xmath4 peak in the ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) invariant mass distribution ,",
    "this does not disappear , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2].b . in the experimental event reconstruction electrons",
    "are often corrected for photon emission effects , but this is not always the case of muons .",
    "thus , one could treat the two cases separately even in the shower simulation , since it is not always true that photon emission from muons leads to negligible effects .",
