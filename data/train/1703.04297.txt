    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices are a topic of significant interest , as they can realize the fundamental models of periodic many body physics which are difficult to explore in traditional condensed matter systems .",
    "typical experiments are highly tunable with respect to the lattice strength and the inter - particle interactions and therefore allow to explore a wide parameter range  @xcite .",
    "this has opened up many new avenues for the study of quantum phase transitions , in particular when combined with the recent progress in creating artificial magnetic fields for ultracold atoms in discrete  @xcite as well as continuum systems  @xcite .",
    "such systems have been studied using the bose hubbard model  @xcite with a complex tunneling term , which incorporates the effect of artificial magnetic fields for bosonic gases in optical lattices .",
    "the main effect of these magnetic fields can be observed even without interactions and the single particle spectrum for bosons in a periodic potential in presence of strong magnetic field forms a self - similar structure known as the hofstadter butterfly  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been proposed that a system of polar gases in optical lattices can give rise to a crystalline phase due to the long range van der waal type interaction  @xcite , and certain conditions make it possible to stabilize the exotic supersolid phase  @xcite .",
    "the observation of bose einstein condensation in chromium  @xcite followed by the realization of degenrate quantum gases made from other highly - magnetic species , including dysprosium  @xcite and erbium  @xcite , and experiments on polar molecules , such as krb  @xcite , have therefore opened up possibilities for manipulating the off - site interactions in optical lattices .",
    "another aspect of quantum gases is the possibility to create low dimensional systems , where @xmath0 or quasi-@xmath0 systems are of special interest as they can enhance the role interactions play , which is crucial for realizing novel phases  @xcite . among these ,",
    "quasi-@xmath0 ladders systems hold particular importance because the extra coupling between the legs of the ladder introduces an additional degree of freedom that can significantly influence quantum phase transitions even in a simple model like the bose - hubbard ladder  @xcite . in the presence of small magnetic fields ,",
    "the two leg bosonic ladder model shows an analog of the meissner state , where currents circulate along the legs of the ladder , while for higher magnetic fields , currents also start flowing along the rungs , resulting in a vortex state .",
    "this phase transition from meissner to vortex state has recently been experimentally observed by m.  atala et al .",
    "related theoretical works  @xcite have studied other non - trivial effects of artificial magnetic fields on such system , including situations where the constraints of the complicated single particle spectrum or the rationality of the applied magnetic field are absent .",
    "this recent progress in the experimental realization of artificial magnetic fields , long range interacting bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , and low dimensional ladder systems , allows to ask interesting question about the interplay of these three influences on cold atomic systems . to investigate this",
    ", we study the specific example of long range interacting bec systems on a _ two _ leg ladder in the presence of a _ uniform _ artificial magnetic field and find that long range interactions gives rise to two phases , namely a density - wave and a supersolid phase  @xcite , in addition to the mott - insulator and superfluid phases obtained in usual bose hubbard model  @xcite . for weak interactions ,",
    "we find that the transition from the meissner to the vortex phase moves to higher magnetic field values , whereas for strong interactions the system displays density - wave and mott - insulator phases .",
    "both of these are stabilized by the magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "in addition , our numerical calculations also show the appearance of a supersolid phase outside the density - wave lobes , which stems from the competition between the short and the long range repulsive interactions .    the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ebhm ]",
    "we introduce the extended bose hubbard model ( ebhm ) with a two - leg ladder geometry in an artificial magnetic field and in section [ sec : singleparticle ] we review the properties of its single particle spectrum . the weakly interacting regime",
    "is then discussed using a gross - pitaevskii approach in section [ sec : gpapproach ] , where we also study the excitations of the system beyond the mean field calculations . in section [ sec : gutzwiller ] , we present the analytic calculations for the determination of the phase boundaries using the variational gutzwiller approach and section [ sec : clustermf ] presents the numerical calculations performed using the cluster mean field theory . finally , in section [ sec : summary ] we present the summary and outlook of the work done .",

    "the intra- and inter - leg hopping amplitudes are given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the on - site interaction energy between two atoms is given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are non - local nearest - neighbour ineractions ( nni ) , along a leg and between the legs respectively .",
    "the ratios @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be changed in an experiment by tuning the laser intensities and/or varying the separation between the legs ( see fig .  [",

    "the phase @xmath7 in the hopping terms is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the vector potential giving rise to the magnetic field @xmath18 .",
    "we use the landau gauge @xmath19 and write the phase @xmath7 in the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the magnetic flux through each plaquette , with @xmath22 as the flux quantum .",
    "the two leg ladder system is quite advantageous compared to fully two dimensional systems , in the sense that it can assume any value between @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the magnetic flux @xmath25 , whereas in two - dimensional systems @xmath26 has to be a rational number .",
    "this is because of symmetry breaking due to the specific gauge choice , which can be restored in a @xmath27-fold enlarged magnetic unit cell .",
    "hence , without the constraint of rational magnetic field values , the two leg ladder system is less complex and can be used to study non - trivial effects of magnetic fields in a relatively simple way .",

    ". the density - wave phase is characterized by an alternate number density distribution where neighboring lattice sites are occupied by @xmath63 and @xmath77 particles in a periodic way .",
    "it can therefore be viewed as consisting of two sublattices , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with @xmath63 and @xmath77 particles on each site of the respective sublattices .",
