    "this is not surprising _ per se _ : the detector receives energy from whichever device is accelerating it , and there is no reason why this energy should not be exchanged with the field . what is surprising , however , is the _ thermal _ character of these transitions in the case of uniform acceleration , discovered by unruh @xcite : thermal states are states of maximal entropy  whence the entropy of  acceleration radiation \" ?",
    "an oft - heard explanation @xcite of this puzzle traces this remarkable effect back to the ( earlier ) fulling - davies _ thermalization theorem _",

    "the argument goes as follows . due to its acceleration ,",
    "a detector in the ( say ) right rindler wedge is causally disconnected from the left modes of the field , which vanish everywhere on its trajectory .",

    "there are no left modes in the first place and the detector interacts with all the degrees of freedom of a pure state of the quantum field .",
    "if the unruh effect were just a consequence of the statistical nature of the state obtained by tracing over the left modes , one would expect that the detector transition rates would fail to be thermal in this setup . on the contrary , we show that the detector records the same unruh thermal radiation as without mirror .",
    "this result shows that the relation between acceleration and temperature discovered by unruh is more general than that determined by the entanglement entropy due to the screening of a causal horizon : it holds also for pure states of the field . in the last section ,",
    "we speculate on the possible nature of the entropy relevant in the general case .    to avoid any misunderstanding ,",
    "let us stress again that by `` unruh effect '' we mean the thermality of detector transition rates for uniform acceleration in the vacuum .",
    "stronger statements are sometimes implied in the literature ( the thermalization theorem itself , planckian transition rates , non - trivial bogoliubov coefficients , etc . ) ; this ambiguity has been a source of confusion in the past .",

    "the transition rates of a particle detector in the presence of a plane boundary have been discussed by several authors @xcite . to our knowledge , however , none of them has drawn what we consider the salient conclusion of this calculation : it shows that the unruh effect is _ not _ just about entanglement with hidden degrees of freedom .    in this paper ,",
    "the signature of spacetime is @xmath5 , and we use geometrized units where @xmath6 .",
    "our main reference on the unruh effect is takagi s thorough review @xcite .",
    "to study the response of a particle detector in the vacuum in a causal manner , we need the concept of _ instantaneous transition rate _ @xcite .",

    "_ emission _ of the same quantum .",
    "consider now a detector which , from the moment @xmath9 at which it is turned on , undergoes a uniform acceleration with magnitude @xmath15 .",
    "the causal version of the unruh effect states that , when @xmath16 , the rates reach a limit @xmath17 which is _ thermal _ at the inverse temperature @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this means that the _ detailed balance condition _ holds : [ detailedbalance ] = e^-_a .",
    "note that _ no assumption regarding the detector s trajectory before @xmath9 or later than @xmath8 is made_. in particular , the rindler horizon plays no direct rle .",
    "assume the planckian form they would have if detector were inertial and immersed in a thermal bath with temperature @xmath19 .",

    "this said , it is true , of course , that during the period from @xmath9 to @xmath8 when it is switched on , the detector only has a partial access to the field degrees of freedom .",
    "this is easy to see by going to the instantaneous rest frame of the detector at the switching time @xmath9 .",
    "there , the worldline for @xmath21 has coordinates \\",

    "the hypersurface @xmath22 is a cauchy surface for the field .",
    "but it is apparent from that at any time @xmath23 , the past light - cone of @xmath7 only contains a subset of @xmath24 , the part of @xmath25 on the right of @xmath4 .",
    "that is , as long as it is accelerated , the detector is connected to only _ half _ of the cauchy data on @xmath25 . in this sense",
    "the acceleration  screens \" some of the field s degrees of freedom  and motivates the partial trace over @xmath26 mentioned by jacobson .",
    "let us now change the setup by placing a _ mirror _ ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) at @xmath4 , so that the field vanishes for @xmath27 . in this case",
    ", @xmath25 is not a cauchy surface any longer ; but its right part @xmath28 is . and _",
    "all the points of @xmath28 are causally connected with the accelerated trajectory _ .",
    "does the unruh effect disappear ?    by the method of images the wightman function @xmath29 in the presence of the mirror is related to the usual one @xmath30 , namely without the mirror , by [ mirrorwightman ] w^>(x ,",
    "y)=w(x , y)-w(x , ry ) , where @xmath31 is the mirror image of @xmath32 with respect to the @xmath4 plane . now , by poincar invariance , we know that @xmath30 only depends on the invariant interval @xmath33 w(x , y)=w((x - y)^2 ) .",
    "locality implies furthermore that @xmath34 when @xmath35 and @xmath32 are spacelike separated and @xmath36 .",
    "this is the case of the points @xmath7 and @xmath37 along the accelerated trajectory : their squared proper distance @xmath38 is given by [ distance ] _ ( s)=2a^-2(1+a(2-s ) ) , where we set @xmath39 for notational simplicity . on the interval @xmath40 , we have [ distancebound ] _ ( s)a^-2e^a , and thus the boundary term @xmath41 quickly vanishes as @xmath42 .    more specifically , if we assume that @xmath43 has a power - law decay at large spacelike separations , viz .",
    "w()^-k , for some @xmath44 , then we have [ expbound ] | w(x(),rx(-s ) ) |a^2ke^-ka .",
    "thus , when evaluated on the accelerated worldline , _ the wightman function is essentially indiscernible from its value in empty space _ , viz . without the mirror . is exponential instead of power - law ( e.g. for a massive field ) , this difference is even more negligible : it is exponentially - exponentially vanishing .",
    "] see fig . 1 .    from and , the detector transition rates in the presence of the mirror read r^>_()=r_()+b _ ( ) where @xmath45 is the empty space term ( with the unruh limit @xmath17 when @xmath46 ) , and [ deferrorterm ] b_()=-2  _ 0^ ds  e^-isw(x(),rx(-s ) ) is the boundary term .",
    "using , it is immediate to see that , as @xmath46 , b_()=(e^-ka ) .",
    "thus , the thermal limit r_^ > ( ) r_a ( ) is reached also with the mirror . _ the absence of hidden field degrees of freedom does not spoil the unruh effect . _",
    "an ingredient we used to arrive at this conclusion is the fact that , when the detector is switched on ( at time @xmath9 ) , the mirror is _ at rest _ relative to the latter . what difference would it make if the mirror were moving towards the detector at this instant , @xmath47 ?",
    "the answer is that the transition rates @xmath48 would start converging to their unruh limit @xmath49 only after a transient regime , during which the mirror recorrelates the field with itself",
    ".    indeed , denote @xmath50 the time when the detector most approaches the mirror , @xmath51 .",
    "then the function @xmath52 measuring the proper distance between @xmath7 and the image @xmath37 reads _ ( s)=2a^-2(1+a(2(-_1)-s ) ) instead of . if @xmath53 , @xmath52 has a minimum at @xmath54 , given by @xmath55 .",
    "this minimum violates the exponential bound .",
    "hence , during this regime , the corrective term @xmath56 does not decrease .",
    "physically , this is because the mirror correlates the field _",
    "after _ the u - turn of the detector with its value _ before _ the u - turn .",
    "the difference between @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 is clearly visible on fig .",
    "the fact that the unruh effect persists in the presence of a mirror on the edge of the detector s horizon does not mean that the state of the quantum field in the right region @xmath60 is the same with and without the mirror .",
    "it is not . in the presence of the mirror , the state is pure ; in the absence of the mirror",
    ", it is mixed . observables different from detector rates",
    "can distinguish between the two cases .",
    "what our result shows is , instead , that the thermal character of the transition rates of a uniformly accelerated detector , pointed out by unruh , can not be reduced to the effect of tracing out modes behind the horizon ; it is present also with a pure state .",
    "what makes this result puzzling  and therefore interesting  is that it blatantly contradicts a basic tenet of statistical physics : the connection between thermality and ignorance of the microstate . in normal systems , indeed , temperature arises as a consequence of microscopic fluctuations , which prevent us from knowing the energy of the system . for this reason , we are led to describe it by means of a probability distribution over its spectrum of states , namely the one which is least biaised towards a specific state ( given the macroscopic constraints ) @xcite . the extent to which this description is uncertain is measured by the corresponding gibbs ( classical ) or von neumann ( quantum ) entropy . as the temperature is lowered down to zero , and the system is driven to its fundamental state , this uncertainty decreases and the entropy goes to zero .    in the standard setup of the unruh effect , that is without the mirror , the fulling - davies thermalization theorem appears to confirm this scenario : it relates the thermal response of the accelerated detector to the ignorance of the state of the field in the left wedge due to its entanglement accross the edge of the wedge .",
    "the entropy associated to the unruh effect can thus be tentatively identified as the von neumann entanglement entropy . as recalled in the introduction , this insight",
    "is often considered a key ingredient to understand the nature of the elusive bekenstein - hawking black hole entropy .    here",
    ", however , we are forced into a radically different interpretation of the unruh effect .",
    "since the state of the field in the presence of the mirror is pure , indeed , we can not account for the thermality of the detector rates by invoking the ignorance of the microstate of the system .",
    "if its energy is uncertain to the accelerated detector , then , it must be _ for another reason _ , and the entropy measuring this uncertainty must be different from the von neumann entropy .",
    "what is this reason , and what is the corresponding entropy ? besides clarifying the nature of the unruh effect , we believe that understanding this point will shed new light on the problem of black hole entropy .    without entering a full discussion , we present here a simple speculative answer .",
    "any state @xmath61 of a quantum system defines a probability distribution p_(a)=|c(a)|^2=|a||^2 on the spectrum of any observable @xmath62 of the system . here",
    "@xmath63 is the eigenstate of @xmath62 with eigenvalue @xmath15 ,    spectrum .",
    "this probability distribution has a shannon entropy s_(a)= - _ a p_(a ) p_(a ) which measures the intrinsic uncertainty in the outcome of the measurement of @xmath62 in the state @xmath61 due to heisenberg uncertainty relations @xcite .",
    "imagine we double the degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "then we can associate to @xmath61 the state |=_a c(a)|a|a where @xmath64 are the states of the second copy of the system .",
    "if we trace over the degrees of freedom of this second copy of the system we obtain the mixed state = _ a p(a)|aa| which has a von newmann entropy equal to the shannon entropy of @xmath65 and which is such that the probability distribution of the outcomes of @xmath62 measurements is the same as for @xmath66 ( this is not true for other observables , obviously ) .",
    "consider this in the case of an accelerated thermometer .",
    "an ( ideal ) inertial thermometer is essentially a device that couples to the energy of the field . in a thermal situation ,",
    "its response depends on the probability distribution of energy eigenstates .",
    "the inertial vacuum state @xmath67 is an eigenstate of the energy @xmath68 with vanishing eigenvalue and therefore an inertial thermometer measures a vanishing temperature .",
    "however , an accelerated detector does not couple to the energy operator @xmath68 ( which generates translations in minkowski time ) , but rather to the restriction @xmath69 of the boost generator @xmath70 to the right rindler modes does not mix left and right modes , hence @xmath69 is well defined .",
    "] , which generates translations in proper time along its accelerated trajectory .",
    "the two operators @xmath68 and @xmath69 do not commute , and the vacuum is an eigenstate of @xmath70 but not of @xmath69 . let @xmath71 be the eigenstates of @xmath69 with eigenvalue @xmath72 and let p_0(k)=|0|k|^2 be the probability that the accelerated detector measures the @xmath72 eigenvalue in the inertial vacuum ( again , assume discrete spectrum and non degeneracy for simplicity )",
    ". then the measurement outcomes are characterized by a shannon entropy s_0(k^>)= - _ k p_0(k ) p_0(k ) .",
    "such shannon entropy is present , and in fact is the same , with or without a mirror .    in the case with the mirror ,",
    "it measures the uncertainty due to the quantum fluctuations associated to measuring an observable ( @xmath69 ) in a state ( @xmath67 ) which is not its eigenstate . in the case without the mirror , this happens to correspond also to the entanglement entropy precisely as the example above : the eigenstates of @xmath69 are correlated with modes beyond the horizon , so that the entanglement entropy in @xmath73 is equal the shannon entropy of the pure state .",
    "the main point is that the probability distribution @xmath74 , which is the quantity of interest from the detector point of view , is independent on whether or not there are modes behind the horizon to be traced over .",
    "what is relevant is only the non - commutativity between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which determines the probability distribution @xmath74 .",
    "hence , we suggest that the entropy responsible for the relation between acceleration and temperature is not the von neumann entropy of the statistical state obtained by tracing beyond horizon modes , but rather the shannon entropy deriving from the heisenberg uncertainty associated to the observable measured by the accelerated detector .",
    "the latter is a measurement of both quantum and thermal uncertainty , with no _ a priori _ distinction between the two .",
    "this is concomitant with smolin s suggestion that quantum and thermal fluctuations could be indistinguishable in a gravitational context where a unique algebra of observables at fixed time is in general non defined @xcite .",
