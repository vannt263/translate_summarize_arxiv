    "galaxy redshift surveys have revealed that the optical restframe color distribution of galaxies is bimodal in both the local and distant universe , beyond @xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies predominantly lie either along the `` red sequence '' , which is composed of mostly quiescent , early - type galaxies , or in the `` blue cloud '' of star - forming , late - type galaxies . from @xmath3 to today , the red sequence has roughly doubled in mass @xcite , presumably as galaxies have moved from the blue cloud to the red sequence as a result of ending star formation and passively evolving .",
    "it is not yet understood what causes galaxies to stop forming stars , nor why their star formation remains quenched , i.e. why they do not continue to accrete additional gas and resume star formation .",
    "one popular proposed mechanism for quenching star formation is gas blowout by a starburst and/or agn , resulting from a merger event ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this picture ,",
    "the starburst and/or agn is activated by gas inflow during the merger , and this subsequently drives an outflowing wind that fully clears gas from the galaxy , leading to the creation of a quiescent elliptical .",
    "a remaining low - luminosity agn may provide a second mode of feedback and deter further star formation by heating any accreted gas , keeping the galaxy red ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while this proposed scenario is attractive in that it solves many outstanding questions relating to the formation of elliptical galaxies , it has yet to be confirmed observationally .",
    "understanding what quenches star formation is critical to understanding how the red sequence is built up over time .",
    "post - starburst galaxies are potentially an ideal population with which to study the processes that quench star formation .",
    "post - starburst galaxies are passing through a brief phase of galaxy evolution : they are seen just after abruptly ceasing star formation .",
    "these galaxies are also known as `` e+a '' or `` k+a '' galaxies from their spectral types , which show a mixture of older stars plus younger a stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their spectra show strong balmer absorption from a stars but no nebular emission , which indicates that they are not currently forming stars .",
    "however , the presence of a stars , which have lifetimes @xmath4 gyr , show that star formation has only recently stopped . as these galaxies age",
    ", the a stars will disappear and their spectra will look like that of an early - type galaxy .",
    "their morphologies and metallicities also imply that they are the immediate progenitors of early - type , red , spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "post - starburst galaxies are therefore likely caught in the act of moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence .",
    "observationally , there are a variety of ways in which to find evidence for the star formation quenching mechanism in these galaxies .",
    "one method is to search for outflowing galactic winds using either blueshifted interstellar medium ( ism ) absorption lines ( see veilleux et al .",
    "2005 for a recent review ) or emission lines @xcite .",
    "detecting winds through blueshifted absorption has the advantage of providing kinematic information on the wind speed along the line of sight . the agn gas blowout picture discussed above recently gained support with the discovery by @xcite of extreme velocity outflows in very luminous post - starburst galaxies at @xmath5 selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "these galaxies are extremely rare , have low space densities , and are bright , blue , and massive ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the outflowing winds are detected in blueshifted  interstellar absorption lines in ten of the fourteen galaxies observed .",
    "the outflow velocities seen in these galaxies are @xmath7  or more , which the authors interpret as galaxy - scale agn winds launched at the epoch of cessation of the starburst . the motivation for agn activity as the driver of these winds is the high velocity of the outflows ; the velocities seen are intermediate between winds in local starburst galaxies and winds in broad absorption line quasars .",

    "we observe galaxies with lower - luminosity agn , both in star - forming and quiescent galaxies , as well as more common post - starburst galaxies , in order to measure the frequency and velocity of outflowing winds via blueshifted absorption in several uv ism lines ( 2343 , 2374 , 2382 , 2586 , 2599  , , and ) .",
    "our aim is to determine ( 1 ) whether winds are frequently found in galaxies that host low - level ( non - quasar ) agn , ( 2 ) whether winds are commonly associated with the truncation of star formation at intermediate redshift , ( 3 ) whether wind presence correlates with star formation activity , ( 4 ) whether the velocities indicate a star formation- or agn - driven wind , and ( 5 ) whether the velocities are high enough to potentially clear the ism of the galaxy and halt star formation .",

    "we therefore fit the deep2/deimos spectra of these sources to estimate the light - weighted age .",
    "the ages derived from the deimos and lris spectra for this sample are similar , such that the stellar continuum fit used to normalize the spectra is similar . for the sdss k+a sample ,",
    "our lris spectra extend to red wavelengths but do not cover the spectra region that contains balmer absorption features .",

    "we note that there is an error of at least 1 gyr on the light - weighted age of the stars and an error of at least 200 myr on the age of the young population due to fitting degeneracies .",

    "we use the stellar continuum fits to correct any small residual fluxing errors in our data below rest wavelengths 2900  , by ensuring that the ratio of the fit to the continuum level in our spectra is close to unity in regions around the , , and  lines of interest .",

    "however , for the deep2 and sdss k+a galaxies , there may be additional systematic errors in the stellar continuum , as the lris spectra do not include red wavelengths for the deep2 sources or the balmer series for the sdss sources .",
    "we may therefore be underestimating the   photospheric absorption in the deep2 stellar continua and overestimating the   photospheric absorption in the sdss stellar continua .",
    "this would imply that the sdss wind absorption ews that we measure are a conservative lower limit ; however , the deep2 wind absorption ews may be overestimated .",
    "the importance of this can be determined by comparing the  ew in the lris stellar continuum best - fit models and those from the deimos and sdss spectra .",
    "the ews are generally similar between the lris and deimos / sdss spectra and therefore our measurements should not be significantly affected .",
    "this is discussed further in section 5.1 below .",
    "in addition , we produce separate continuum normalized spectra that that are normalized by a smooth continuum not including stellar absorption .",
    "these spectra are used to estimate how much our results are biased if stellar absorption is _ not _ explicitly accounted for . to create these spectra we use the best fit model above to define the broad shape of the continuum level .",
    "we divide the model fit into bins @xmath1950   wide and use the maximum value of the fit in that bin as an estimate of the continuum level .",
    "this ensures that we use the continuum level of the fit but do not include any absorption lines .",
    "the width of 50   is large enough to ensure that no absorption line features contribute but is small enough to retain the shape and wiggles in the overall continuum level .",
    "we then interpolate this coarse continuum estimate onto the wavelength grid in the data , and divide the observed spectrum by the continuum estimate .",
    "investigating the continuum - normalized spectra by eye , we conclude that this method works well for our purposes .",
    "we model the , , and  absorption lines in our data by fitting a gaussian to the continuum - normalized spectra , from which we can estimate the velocity offset of the center of the absorption profile , the velocity width of the profile , and the lower limit on the covering fraction ( equal to the observed absorption depth ) .",
    "first , following @xcite we attempt to separate absorption due to outflowing gas from absorption due to the ism of the galaxy ( i.e. not in an outflow component ) with the following model :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the observed flux density , @xmath102 is the underlying stellar continuum fit , and @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the absorption features from the intrinsic ( symmetric ) and outflow ( blueshifted ) absorption .",
    "to estimate the intrinsic ism absorption of the galaxy , if any , we first fit a gaussian to the continuum - normalized flux and use the result to model the absorption _ redward _ of the systemic velocity for each line as an estimate of the systemic absorption .",
    "we assume that this absorption is symmetric about the systemic velocity of the line and divide out this model fit to the data both blueward and redward of the systemic velocity .",
    "we then fit the resulting data ( where the remaining absorption should be due only to an outflowing component ) with a new gaussian .",
    "this step of removing the systemic absorption is performed only for those objects and lines in which the data redward of the systemic velocity was negative ( i.e. showed absorption ) .",
    "only galaxies in the blue cloud show this absorption , including four x - ray agn host galaxies , two deep2 k+a galaxies , and one sdss k+a galaxy , not all of which have detected blueshifted absorption .    for the  and  2586 , 2599   lines we model the symmetric absorption as the product of two gaussians @xmath105 centered on the wavelengths @xmath106 , with velocity dispersion @xmath107 and intensities @xmath108 :    @xmath109    for the  2586 , 2599   lines",
    "we allow @xmath110 and @xmath111 to be fit independently .",
    "for the  doublet the systemic component of the bluer line may be impacted by absorption from the outflowing wind component of the redder line .",
    "we therefore use the measured systemic component from the redder line alone for both lines in the doublet , assuming that the systemic component is the same for both , which would be true if the systemic absorption in the  line is saturated .",
    "given that the ratio of the minimum absorption in the two lines is close to unity , this assumption of @xmath112 is well justified .",
    "we then remove this systemic absorption from both lines in the doublet and fit the remaining data with a double gaussian , where we restrict both lines to have the same velocity width but allow the relative depths of the lines to vary .",
    "the gaussian fit to the remaining absorption blueward of systemic provides an estimate of the velocity centroid of the outflowing wind , the velocity width of the wind , and the minimum line depth .",
    "the covering fraction is simply 1 - the minimum line depth ( or @xmath104 ) if the data are high resolution and the line is optically thick ; here we can only obtain a lower limit on the covering fraction due to our resolution .    as the various agn and k+a samples",
    "were observed using different blue side grisms , the velocity resolution varies .",
    "the resolution at 2800   restframe for the x - ray agn sample is @xmath19540 , while for the deep2 k+a sample it is @xmath19250 , and for the sdss k+a sample it is @xmath19150 .",
    "these differences will affect measurements of the velocity width and line depth , which should be interpreted with caution .",
    "however , they should not significantly affect the velocity centroid or our ability to detect outflows , which is dominated by the s / n of the spectra .",
    "as discussed above , only a few galaxies in our sample with blueshifted absorption have systemic absorption removed . while in theory",
    "this , when combined with the different velocity resolution of our samples , could affect the velocity centroid of the outflow in these objects , in one x - ray agn host galaxy where systemic absorption is removed from the  lines but not the  doublet ( due to the presence of  emission ) , the outflow velocity centroids of the   and  lines are consistent with each other .    from the gaussian fit we can estimate where the blueward flux of the fit is within 1@xmath107 of the continuum ;",
    "we call this the ` maximum velocity ' of the wind .",
    "we integrate the continuum - normalized flux from the systemic velocity to this maximum velocity to measure the ew and associated error .",
    "the velocity range used to measure the ew therefore varies from object to object .",
    "this approach is summarized in figure  5 , which shows the results of fitting the  doublet and  for an x - ray agn host galaxy .",
    "the absorption ew is measured after removing any systemic component , such that it is the ew of the outflow component alone . without subtracting systemic absorption due to ism in the galaxy , any estimates of the outflow kinematics or ew",
    "may be systematically biased .",
    "for example , for the  line shown in figure  5 , the ew is 2.3 times greater , the velocity width is 1.9 times wider , and the velocity centroid is 0.3 times smaller if the systemic absorption is not removed . for the  doublet ,",
    "the ew is 1.7 times greater , the velocity width is 1.5 times wider , and the velocity centroid is 0.5 times smaller if the systemic absorption is not removed .",
    "therefore , quantitative results can be _ up to a factor of 2 to 3 different _ if systemic absorption is not accounted for .    for lines without detectable absorption",
    ", we estimate the 2@xmath107 upper limit on the ew that could have been measured .",
    "this is complicated due to  emission in many cases ;  emission is discussed further in section 4.3 below .",
    "we further test whether our measured  absorption parameters are sensitive to the stellar absorption accounted for in our continuum fits by measuring  absorption in continuum - normalized spectra both with and without stellar absorption included .",
    "we test the higher s / n x - ray agn host galaxies and find that when  emission is not present , the results are not sensitive to stellar absorption , as our method above accounts for all absorption at systemic , whether from stars or the ism .",
    "however , the stellar absorption included in our continuum fits can affect the detected  emission , in that one can underestimate the  emission if stellar absorption is not accounted for ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "in this section we first present results of fitting our spectra for , , and  absorption , investigating which objects have outflowing winds as seen in blueshifted absorption and what the wind properties are . we then compare the different absorption lines . in the following section we present measurements of  and emission in each object , which likely originates in the wind as well @xcite .",

    "these figures clearly show the variance seen among different objects in our sample in terms of the absorption line strengths and velocity profiles .",
    "the figures also illuminate the importance of accounting for stellar absorption at  and  in objects with older stars , as the continuum - normalized spectra often have features , such as  in emission , that are not clearly seen in the observed spectra .",

    "as seen in table  8 , roughly half of the galaxies with blueshifted absorption also have emission , but some objects with emission do not have blueshifted absorption .",
    "there is also very little correlation between detection of  emission and emission .",
    "however , given that emission is detected in k+a galaxies that do not have on - going star formation or nebular lines , it is likely that the emission is from the wind itself . the fact that we do not often detect both  and emission in the same galaxy may be due to dust in the galaxy .",
    "we find that outflows are common both in galaxies that host low - luminosity agn and in post - starburst galaxies that are no longer forming stars .",
    "the prevalence of winds as detected in blueshifted absorption can be used to constrain the opening angle of the outflows . as we detect blueshifted absorption in 60% of the x - ray agn host galaxies",
    ", this implies that at least 60% of these galaxies have a wind ( if it is isotropic ) or 100% of these galaxies could have a wind with a geometric covering fraction of 60% , corresponding to an opening angle of 66 degrees for a biconical outflow . in the post - starburst sample we detect blueshifted absorption in 29% of the deep2 k+a galaxies and 33% of the sdss k+a galaxies , implying a geometric covering fraction of at least @xmath1930% , which corresponds to an opening angle of 46 degrees .",
    "larger sample sizes with higher s / n would , of course , be preferable for determining these fractions and constraining wind models , as the prevalence found here is a lower limit due to the low s / n of our data .",

    "our sample does not cover a wide enough range in x - ray luminosity to test for a dependence between outflow properties and x - ray luminosity .",
    "the sample we present here is quite complementary to other samples with measured wind properties from  absorption at @xmath131 .",

    "our detection of  winds in x - ray agn host galaxies that are on the red sequence is somewhat analogous to results from @xcite , who study na  d absorption in lower redshift galaxies in aegis , at @xmath141 .",

    "lrgs are expected to be at a later evolutionary stage than the red sequence galaxies studied here , however , and it is entirely possible that their assembly history and/or star formation quenching mechanism(s ) are quite different than for typical red galaxies , or that the winds do not reach the combination of impact parameter and density needed for detection against background qsos .",
    "our sample does not show the extreme velocity outflows seen by @xcite in their sdss post - starburst sample at @xmath5 , except for one x - ray agn host galaxy that appears to have an outflow with a velocity centroid @xmath20600 .",
    "compared to the @xcite k+a galaxies , the post - starburst galaxies that we study are more common and less luminous and are therefore likely to reflect a more frequent path to the red sequence .",
    "our sdss k+a galaxies are also redder , which may indicate that they are at a later evolutionary stage .",
    "additionally , the absorption profile that we observe in our sample is similar to that seen in the coadded spectra of star - forming galaxies in @xcite and @xcite , with absorption extending from systemic out to @xmath144 , often with a sawtooth - like profile .",
    "we do not observe profiles akin to what is seen by @xcite , in which the absorption profile is narrower and offset from systemic , with very little to no absorption at systemic .",
    "it appears that either the driving mechanism or duration of the gas ejection is different between our sample and that of @xcite .",
    "our results regarding winds in agn host galaxies can be compared with work by @xcite at lower redshift and @xcite at higher redshift . at @xmath91 , @xcite",
    "find that starburst , ir - bright galaxies with liner emission have marginally higher velocity winds ( @xmath19100 , measured with 95% confidence ) than non - liner galaxies .",
    "they find that the detection rate of winds in liner galaxies is the same as in non - liner galaxies and note that the liner emission may come from shocks in the gas of the galaxy or wind , as opposed to weak agn emission . at @xmath25 , @xcite find that in uv - selected galaxies with optically - identified , narrow - line agn , the absorption line in a coadded spectrum of 33 agn host galaxies shows absorption at higher velocities than in a coadded spectrum of non - agn host galaxies .",
    "however , the interpretation is complicated by the presence of emission , which is stronger in the agn host galaxies .",
    "emission - line filling may therefore account for the bulk of the difference observed .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that our finding that x - ray selected agn host galaxies at @xmath145 do not have significantly faster winds than star - forming galaxies at similar redshifts is not strongly at odds with results from lower and higher redshift .",
    "what is the physical driver of the winds detected here ? for sources in our agn host galaxy sample , given that their wind properties are similar to those in our k+a sample and in the star - forming samples of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we conclude that the winds are not primarily agn - driven .",
    "the fact that whether or not a galaxy has a low luminosity agn does not change its wind properties suggests that the winds are driven by supernovae .",
    "the relatively low outflow velocities observed are consistent with this scenario , though it is possible that low luminosity agn drive winds with comparable velocities as those observed in star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , for the x - ray agn host galaxies that have ongoing star formation , sne - driven winds seem quite plausible .",
    "we also note that as these galaxies are continuing to form stars , the agn in them can not have driven such strong winds so as to have quenched star formation .",
    "four of the six blue x - ray agn host galaxies studied here also show  and/or   absorption at the systemic velocity of the galaxy , indicating that the winds in these galaxies have not fully expelled the cool gas present .",
    "the lirg in our sample lies on the lower - redshift relation of @xcite for wind velocity versus sfr ( the lirg has a sfr of 45 @xmath38 , estimated from the 24  flux ) , implying consistency with a sne - driven wind . for the red x - ray agn host galaxies in our sample with winds",
    ", the winds may be relic winds that were driven by sne during the quenching of star formation in these galaxies .",
    "if the winds in the x - ray agn host galaxies are nonetheless driven by the agn itself and not sne , we note that the wind velocities are not particularly high , indicating that low luminosity agn are unlikely to drive strong enough winds to quench star formation . whether the winds are due to either star formation ( at least in the blue galaxies ) or low luminosity agn activity , the outflows observed do not appear to be fast enough to clear the ism of the galaxy and lead to migration to the red sequence .",
    "@xcite estimate the escape velocities of their @xmath121 star - forming deep2 galaxies using the 3727    linewidth and find that the median escape velocity is @xmath19400 - 450  for galaxies with stellar masses log(m)@xmath199.5 - 10.5  and sfr@xmath1910 - 40 .",
    "the velocity centroids of the winds we detect in our sample are generally lower than this estimated escape velocity , though the maximum velocity observed for many of our sources ( especially the agn hosts ) does exceed this .",
    "this implies , similarly to the @xcite sample , that while some of the gas may be travelling at high enough speeds to escape the halo of the galaxy , the bulk of the gas remains bound .",
    "winds in the post - starburst galaxies studied here may be driven by sne resulting from the most recent starburst .",
    "it is worth noting that several of our k+a galaxies have  and/or  absorption at the systemic velocity .",
    "these galaxies , which are either in the blue cloud or green valley , apparently have cool gas that was not expelled either during the recent starburst or by the current outflowing wind .",
    "why do we not observe extreme outflows similar to those observed by @xcite ?",
    "our k+a galaxies may be at a later evolutionary stage , which could suggest that the extreme wind phase , if present , does not last long .",
    "however , if our k+a galaxies are at a later evolutionary stage and further on their way to the red sequence , and if the extreme outflows only exist in the youngest objects , our objects should have already gone through the extreme wind phase .",
    "as our objects are still in the process of ejecting gas , this scenario would require that they had a wind with a central velocity @xmath146  which nonetheless did not clear the ism from the galaxy .",
    "a more plausible explanation is that these sources have not passed through the extreme wind phase observed by @xcite .",
    "either these galaxies have not had a violent agn outburst , or if the winds in the @xcite sources are sne - driven and not agn - driven , then perhaps the recent starburst in the k+a galaxies in our sample did not form as many stars as those in the @xcite sample and as such there are fewer sne driving winds in our galaxies .",
    "preliminary evidence from the @xcite sample indicates that the starburst decay time  or timescale for star formation quenching  is extremely short in those galaxies ( @xmath1925 myr , tremonti , private communication ) , which implies that they are not ` typical ' post - starburst galaxies .",
    "it is notable that the one object in our sample that may have an extreme wind with a velocity @xmath291000  is an x - ray agn host galaxy on the red sequence .",
    "we note that if the wind was launched 640 myr ago ( corresponding to the age of the young stellar population in this galaxy ) and has been traveling at a constant speed of @xmath191,000  since , it would now be at a radius of @xmath19650 kpc and would likely not be observable in absorption .",
    "this argues that the wind was either launched more recently or ( possibly more likely ) has not been traveling at this high constant velocity since its inception .",
    "if this wind is a relic agn wind , then it may be that the agn was powerful enough to drive a wind that shut off star formation in this red galaxy .",
    "if this is the case and is common for agn in red host galaxies , then the agn observed in blue host galaxies may be intrinsically different ( e.g. , have lower mass black holes , lower accretion rates , and/or be at an earlier evolutionary stage ) and therefore drive lower velocity winds .",
    "we note , however , that only one of the three red agn host galaxies studied here has a wind detected in absorption for which we can derive kinematic information .    in summary",
    ", we find in our sample targeting low - luminosity agn host galaxies and post - starburst galaxies at intermediate redshift that outflowing galactic winds are prevalent in these galaxies , as detected either by  and  absorption or  and emission .",
    "the velocities of the winds are roughly consistent with those observed in star - forming galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "further , the presence of a low - luminosity agn does not appear to commonly drive faster winds , such that these winds are likely sne - driven . in our post - starburst sample we do not detect the extreme winds observed by @xcite and conclude that most post - starburst galaxies likely do not host such high velocity winds .",
    "we therefore find that while galactic winds are common in both low - luminosity agn host galaxies and post - starburst galaxies , they do not appear to play a major role in quenching star formation .",
