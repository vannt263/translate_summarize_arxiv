    "( [ eq : n+- ] ) , the number of produced same - sign muon pairs depends on the cuts ; the set of cuts is spelled out at the end of sec .",

    "moreover , in presence of cuts , the effects of quark production , fragmentation and decay do not decouple from each other - even after integration over the phase space .",
    "it is only in the limit of no cuts ( i.e. unrestricted integration over the whole phase space ) that such factorization might take place .",

    "this is a standard assumption in works on the subject .",
    "second , we have assumed that the production of the intermediate neutral @xmath0 mesons factorizes from their decay .",
    "this is natural since the @xmath44-mesons are well defined particles and different scales drive their production / decay .      the non - perturbative fragmentation functions @xmath45 appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dsigma++],[eq : dsigma ] ) are typically extracted from lep data .",

    "@xcite the values measured at the tevatron are used .",
    "the fragmentation functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are not known .",
    "the most accurately measured fragmentation functions at the @xmath51 pole are for a combination of @xmath56 mesons and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "we expect that these two functions are different .",
    "first , the two fragmentation fractions are rather different ( by approximately a factor of 4 ) which implies different non - perturbative dynamics in the two cases .",
    "second , we can _ roughly _ estimate these functions by utilizing the fragmentation function of peterson et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is fixed by the normalization and we take the parameter @xmath60 . in the following we will use @xmath61 ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath62 .",
    "our motivation for choosing these values for @xmath63 is the following . the best value for @xmath64 extracted in ref .",

    "this parameter is for the above mentioned combination of @xmath15-flavored hadrons . assuming that the fragmentation functions for the charged mesons and baryons are softer than these for the @xmath66 , our choice of @xmath63 leads to the following reasonable values for the fragmentation parameters @xmath67 .",
    "a second constraint we have imposed on @xmath63 is that the difference @xmath68 is consistent with the mass difference of the corresponding @xmath0 mesons ( or of the current quark masses ) .    in our subsequent analysis",
    "we need the fifth moments @xmath69 of these functions @xmath70 for which we obtain @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , the only information about the functions @xmath73 that will enter our analysis is their ratio @xmath74 we stress once again that our method of estimation should be adequate for its restricted use .",
    "furthermore our estimates are consistent with the expectation for the difference between these fragmentation function discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are two types of decays for the produced @xmath0 mesons :  right \" ( r ) decays @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) and  wrong \" ( w ) ones @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 ) .",

    "( [ eq : ath],[eq : anum],[eq : aden ] ) are our main result . in general , the three functions @xmath98 and @xmath99 are different from each other and therefore eq .  ( [ eq : anum ] ) does not factorize .",

    "the motivation for this approximation follows the results of ref .",
    "@xcite : in the case of single @xmath0 meson production in the same @xmath18 range , the partonic cross - section behaves as a power @xmath105 . in such a case the convolution becomes sensitive only to the @xmath106-th moment of the corresponding fragmentation function and the convolution becomes a simple product , i.e. @xmath107 . in the following we take @xmath108 .    within the approximation ( [ eq : phi ] )",
    ", the same sign dimuon asymmetry reads : @xmath109 the above equation has the virtue that it exhibits the essence of the general result ( [ eq : ath],[eq : anum],[eq : aden ] ) ( i.e. explicit dependence on cuts and production stage effects ) but in a simplified manner that allows direct interpretation .",
    "in particular , we see that all the dependence on cuts and @xmath0 meson production - stage effects can be absorbed into effective production fractions @xmath110 .",
    "it is for this reason we believe that our analysis underscores the need for a better understanding of the difference in the production fractions @xmath111 measured at the tevatron and at the @xmath51 pole .",

    "an important implication is that the analysis in this region is _ robust _ with respect to these parameters .",
    "second , we note that each one of the two effects studied in this paper : @xmath0 fragmentation and sensitivity to the values of the b meson production fractions , pushes the band of the dimuon asymmetry measurement further away from the sm expectation in the region of small @xmath131 .",

    "<S> the existing predictions for the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry at the tevatron are expressed in terms of parameters related to @xmath0 mesons mixing and inclusive production fractions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the realistic case when phase - space cuts are applied , the asymmetry depends also on the details of the production mechanism for the @xmath0 mesons . in particular , it is sensitive to the difference in the fragmentation functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate these fragmentation effects and find that they shift the theory prediction for this observable by approximately 10% . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out the approximately 20 % sensitivity of the asymmetry depending on which set of values for the @xmath0 meson production fractions is used : as measured at the z pole or at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of these effects on the extraction of @xmath3 from the d  measurement is presented . </S>"
