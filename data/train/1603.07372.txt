    "publications on astrophysics have traditionally paid attention to the processes involving highly excited ( rydberg ) atom : in stellar atmospheres of late spectral types , interstellar nebulae and other space objects , including our solar system .",
    "the concentration of periodic table elements in geocosmic entities can exceed their average concentration in the universe by many orders of magnitude .",
    "the examples include the clouds of alkali atoms k and na in the atmosphere of the galilean satellite io of the planet jupiter and chemi - ionization processes that result in the formation of a wide range of molecular ions .",
    "the constants of these processes in the thermal interval of energy can reach values of the order of @xmath0 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "since the characteristics of rydberg states of atoms and quasi - molecular complexes are with certain exceptions ( which are described in terms of a quantum defect theory ) close to those of a hydrogen atom , they are nowadays widely used in solving current problems of nonlinear dynamics of quantized systems .",
    "physics and chemistry of low - temperature plasma are most interested in the processes where a transition of an optical electron into ionization continuum changes the nature of particles and occurs in thermal collisions .",
    "these processes are traditionally considered as an effective channel of molecular ion formation . according to publications ,",
    "the maximum values of effective constants of the formation of a stable charged complex in binary collisions correspond to the value range of principal quantum numbers @xmath1 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "enrico fermi made the fundamental contribution into the physics of atomic collisions involving rydberg atoms ( ra ) .",
    "he suggested treating the structure of the rydberg diatomic quasi - molecular complex as the system of two coulomb centers and a quasi - free rydberg electron ( re ) on the trajectory orbit @xcite .",
    "cold ( @xmath2 ) molecules of alkali atoms were observed in magneto - optical traps .",
    "today , the study of phenomena that determine evolution and stochastic properties of deterministic hamiltonian systems is an important branch of nonlinear mechanics with potentially interesting applications in atomic and molecular physics .",
    "research in the field of non - linear mechanics @xcite indicates that dynamic chaos conditions should be treated as a typical rather than an exceptional situation for the dynamics of hamiltonian systems with small number of degrees of freedom . in the physics of atomic collisions under the semi - classical treaty ,",
    "chaos conditions arise as a result of unstable trajectory orbits of optical electrons . generally , there are always regions of phase space and parameters of a system of interacting particles , where the hamiltonian system dynamics is stochastic .",
    "the transition from integrable problems of classical dynamics to a system with chaos is accompanied by the emergence of areas in the phase space that are the centers of chaos and form `` stochastic layers '' and a `` stochastic web '' @xcite . even in a one - dimensional problem with a time - variable external disturbance",
    ", the effects of dynamic chaos may occur .",
    "a complete review of data ( more than 280 references ) obtained before 1995 with regard to the dynamics of the optical electron in an excited hydrogen atom in external microwave and alternating electric fields can be found in @xcite .",
    "work of @xcite is noteworthy as one of the studies that influenced the development of theoretical and experimental research in the field of dynamic chaos phenomena in excited atom systems .",
    "this research grounded the applicability of quasi - classics in describing the development of dynamic chaos phenomena in a quasi - hydrogen rydberg alkali atom and showed the difference of the arising process of `` stochastic diffusion '' from multiphoton and tunnel ionizations in a diatomic quasi - molecular complex . in the diffusion case , _ _ the stochasticity domain in the principal quantum number space is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are states with the outer electron regular motion , and @xmath5 belong to continuous spectrum states defined by chirikov criterion @xcite .",
    "today quasi - classical approximation of quantum mechanics @xcite involving bohr - sommerfeld quantum conditions with its visual interpretation is widely and practically applied in atomic physics . within its framework ,",
    "the main results have been obtained so far with regard to the problem of associative ionization occurring in the intermediate state of a rydberg quasi - molecular diatomic complex @xcite .",
    "importantly , the stochastic ionization treaties for quasimolecular collision complexes or under situations when ionization is stimulated by external microwave fields are essentially one - dimensional since they are based on the assumption that the re orbital momentum @xmath6 remains invariant in the process of re diffusion .",
    "the issue how @xmath6 evolves in the case of the actual three - dimension quantum systems and whether this evolution can significantly affect the results of one - dimensional approaches is briefly outlined in the present paper .",
    "another important issue is related to the influence of the external statistic electromagnetic fields on the atomic quantum states structure and , as a consequence , on the values of dipole matrix elements .",
    "the latter determines the rate constants values in the equations describing radiation / impact kinetics of geocosmic media , so that the quantum defect control by external fields can serve as a means to manipulate both the rydberg complexes emission spectra and the collision ionization .",
    "it is known that direct analogies exist between the processes in the laboratory ( earth s ) plasma and geocosmic plasma . in the atmospheres of helium - rich cooling",
    "white dwarfs stars , as well as in earth conditions in the temperature range of @xmath7k with ionization degree of the order of @xmath8 , chemi - ionization plays the major role in the balance of ionization - recombination processes with @xmath9 @xcite .",

    "the atoms in the upper excited states with values of effective quantum numbers @xmath10 have unique characteristics conditioned by the strong dependence of their parameters on @xmath11 : polarizability @xmath12 , dipole moment @xmath13 etc . , making them effective partners in inelastic atomic and molecular collisions . the dipole resonance ionization mechanism is briefly described below according to @xcite .",
    "so far the absolute majority of calculations of ionization processes occurring in the intermediate state of a rydberg quasi - molecular complex have been performed within the framework of that ionization model .",
    "the rydberg quasi - molecular complex @xmath14 stabilization or decay with the formation of charged fragments are determined by the set of such parameters as peculiarities of interaction potentials , the nature and the level of particle excitation , and the relative collision energy .",
    "the main contribution into the ionization occurs in the range of internuclear distances @xmath15 at which the weakly bound ( outer ) electron becomes shared within the parent complex @xmath16 .",
    "charge exchange in that complex induces the generation of an time varying dipole moment @xmath17 that , in its turn , causes the emergence of a quasi - monochromatic microwave electric field pertubing rydberg electron ( re ) motion in the keplerian orbit .",
    "the corresponding charge exchange frequency @xmath18 appears to be equal to the exchange interaction @xmath19 or , equivalently , to the frequency of complete rotations of the low - bound electron orbital motion .",
    "the probability of autoionization decay of the complex @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath20 and depends on the value of the re photoionization cross - section , i.e. on the probability of the re stimulated transition from the bound state with the binding energy @xmath21 into the states of a continuous spectrum with the electron kinetic energy @xmath22 .",
    "the emitted electron energy coincides with the energy released during the transition of the initial state of @xmath23 into the state @xmath24 , that is reflected in the name `` dipole resonance mechanism '' of the process .",
    "it should be noted that today the interest in chemi - ionization of rydberg atoms is experiencing a renaissance due to the need to take them into account in the quantum electronics physics , on the one hand , and on the other hand , due to the negative impact of rydberg complexes induced by geomagnetic disturbances in the earth s ionosphere on our biosphere , including the human being per se .",
    "deterministic drm - theory has played a major role in understanding the processes that underlie ionization mechanisms involving rydberg atoms . moreover , the model is valid for both a symmetrical and an asymmetrical process @xcite .",
    "new features of the drm - theory largely stimulate the development of experimental research , for example , the use of synchrotron radiation to excite molecular clusters @xcite .",
    "in the literature , the term `` dynamic chaos '' in atomic systems refers to the result of the evolution of deterministic ( causal ) quantized atomic systems , which dynamics over time can not be accurately predicted . as an example , consider three options :    \\(i ) rydberg hydrogen atom or quasi - hydrogen alkali atom in an external electric ( electromagnetic ) field @xcite .",

    "the field perturbation causes the main change @xmath26 in the principal quantum number @xmath27 of the initial state of the atom when the external field angular frequency @xmath28 coincides with the circular frequency of the electron motion in the keplerian orbit @xmath29 ( resonance ) . in the case of alkali atoms",
    "the effective quantum number @xmath11 differs from the principal one @xmath30 on the value of the quantum defect @xmath31 : @xmath32 .",
    "essentially , the authors of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) suggested a stochastic ionization mechanism unparalleled in tunnel ionization or multiphoton ionization , i.e. the diffusion ionization mechanism . in quantum mechanics , this is explained within the model of `` multiphoton '' resonance , under which the @xmath33-photon energy coincides with the energy levels separation of an excited particle .",
    "quasi - classical approach connects the stochastization effect with the emergence of a stationary term @xmath34 ) in the perturbing series that formally corresponds to the m - photon resonance when the product @xmath35 coincides with the re k - overtone : @xmath36 where m and k are integer numbers . in this case",

    ", the external pertubation can significantly distort the initial ( unperturbed ) motion of the electron .",
    "note also the root ( non - linear ) dependence of @xmath39 on the value of the disturbing potential .",
    "the emergence of the finite width of nonlinear resonance for nonlinear systems ( @xmath46 is crucial for the formulation of global ( strong ) chaos conditions . generally speaking , in the energy space with a given external excitation , a discrete set of `` resonant '' energies @xmath47 , which are conditioned by nonlinear resonances of different orders , can be realized ( along with the corresponding quantum numbers @xmath48 ) . in the case of a weak excitation",
    "the widths @xmath39 of neighboring resonances do not overlap , i.e. @xmath49 . if the system motion starts with the initial energy value @xmath50 , the system always remains `` bound '' within the width @xmath39 .",
    "the situation changes radically when the regions of neighboring nonlinear resonances begin to overlap , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "now the electron can `` diffuse '' in the neighborhood of any nonlinear resonance and go away from its initial position as far as can be in the energy space .",
    "the resonance overlap condition is known in the literature as chirikov criterion for the onset of the global chaos @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath52 ( chirikov parameter ) equals one was shown to be the threshold of the global chaos realization .",
    "note that the widths of dynamic resonances and , consequently , the effects of stochastic dynamics are directly related to the matrix elements of perturbation operators .",
    "this observation is confirmed by the data in @xcite , where the coefficients of the light - induced re diffusion equation in an external microwave field are explicitly expressed using dipole matrix elements of an external field .",
    "some results of the theory of dynamical chaos , which are useful for carrying out relevant assessments may be found in works of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the improved method of split evolutions was also applied in calculations on the base of floquet technique @xcite that allows extending the algorithms used for nonstationary problems . as a result ,",
    "an algorithm for calculating re trajectories in the coulomb potential perturbed with a microwave electrical field was elaborated @xcite .    below we show in fig .  1 numerical results on the chaotic diffusion dynamics of re in a hydrogen atom which evolves from the initial state 10p ( with the principal @xmath53 , and orbital @xmath54 quantum numbers ) to the ionization continuum in the presence of the external microwave field @xmath55 .",
    "the field frequency is taken as @xmath56 at.u .",
    "the field amplitude @xmath57 is chosen to exceed the critical value @xmath58 , @xcite for the onset of the dynamic chaos regime .",
    "when the amplitude @xmath59 , all dynamic resonances occurring in the region @xmath60 overlap , so that re may free - diffuse into continuum . under the semi - classical approach the description of the wave - function evolution",
    "is carried out in terms of the re classical trajectories characteristics such as the energy @xmath37 and the angular momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the initial value @xmath61 of @xmath62 is determined , for instance , via the initial orbital quantum number @xmath63 with the semi - classical formula @xmath64 @xcite while the initial energy @xmath65 of the trajectory is obtained via eq .",

    "the case where one of the levels of _ _ l-__series of an atom is located in energy space exactly between the two levels of adjacent series ( _ l _    1 ) or ( _ l _  +  1 ) is called fster resonance or double stark resonance @xcite . this configuration corresponds to a two - photon resonance for a cascade transition @xmath78 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "such situation occurring when @xmath79 in terms of the quantum defect @xmath80 is typical for rydberg alkali atoms ( in the case of na , for instance , @xmath81 ) , while it is absent in the hydrogen atom .",

    "2 is similar to that of a three - dimensional quantum oscillator according to the second bohr correspondence rule @xcite , where `` long '' optical transitions are forbidden ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in other words , it is the matter of most of the transitions being blocked due to a significant decrease in the values of their dipole matrix elements .",
    "the both electron diffusion over the grid of quasi - crossing energy curves of a rydberg complex and radiative processes should be damped under the realization of fster resonance .    as an illustration",

    "those important facts should be properly accounted for in the radiation - collisional kinetics in the atmospheres of celestial objects under the presence of quasi - static electric / magnetic fields resulting in essential stark / zeeman shifts of atomic levels .",
    "one of the consequences , for instance , may be dramatic redistribution of rydberg states @xmath96 populations with the subsequent changes in ir emission spectra .",
    "in the literature , the term `` chaotic '' refers to quantum - mechanical or quasi - classical ensembles .",
    "it implies a probabilistic description of physical phenomena which can not be reduced to a conventional notation of an individual wave functions or a trajectory .",
    "the main reason for the conversion of a regular atomic system into chaotic one under the influence of external time - varying forces is mainly connected with the emergence of the so - called `` dynamic nonlinear resonances '' . their mutual overlapping results in the emergence of a global dynamical chaos .",
    "in this paper , the stochasticity is considered with regard to diffusion ionization , arising due to complicated energy levels of a rydberg quasi - molecular collisional complex or stimulated by an external weak microwave field .",
    "we discussed as well a possibility of blocking dipole optical transitions in a rydberg atom due to the quantum states shifts under the presence of statistic electromagnetic fields and describe the corresponding dramatic changes in both the dynamic chaos regime and kinetics of radiative processes .",
