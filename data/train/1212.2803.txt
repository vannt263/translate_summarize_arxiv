    "ultrarelativistic heavy - ion experiments have shown very rich physics which can not be interpreted by mere extrapolation from elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions to nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "this is evidenced from the suppression of high transverse momentum region of hadron spectra up to a factor of 5 relative to nucleon - nucleon collisions , which is an indication for strong absorption of high - energy partons traversing the medium  @xcite .",
    "also the inclusive production of charm quark bound states are suppressed by a factor of 3 - 5 at both super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) experiments which hints their dissolution in the medium  @xcite .",
    "these accumulated evidences indicate that a new form of matter has been produced in the heavy - ion collision experiments , called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . among different experimental observations which may be served as the signals for the qgp formation",
    ", quarkonium suppression has been proposed long time ago as a clear probe of the qgp formation in the collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "first , in a pioneering work by matsui and satz  @xcite and later in a follow up quantitative calculation  @xcite , it was shown that the suppression of @xmath2 yields could be explained by the ( color ) screening of the potential between a heavy quark and anti - quark by the surrounding deconfined light quarks and gluons .",
    "theoretically , one can study the quarkonium states by using the effective field theories .",
    "since the mass of heavy quark , @xmath3 is much larger than the intrinsic scale in the theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , @xmath4 , the heavy quark and anti - quark are expected to move slowly with a relative velocity @xmath5 and results in the non - relativistic version of qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "however , nrqcd does not fully exploit the smallness of @xmath6 which further gives rise another effective theory , known as potential non - relativistic qcd ( pnrqcd )  @xcite by integrating out the momentum scale .",
    "the heavy quark pairs formed in relativistic nuclear collisions develop into the physical resonances and traverse the plasma and then hot hadronic matter before decaying into dilepton pairs .",
    "even before the resonance is formed it may be absorbed by the nucleons streaming past it  @xcite and by the time the resonance is formed , the screening of the color force in the plasma may inhibit the formation of bound states .",
    "the resonance(s ) could also be dissociated either by hard gluons  @xcite or by comoving hot hadrons  @xcite . in order to disentangle these sequential effects  @xcite",
    ", we must know how the properties of quarkonium states change in medium .",
    "the basic tools of phenomenological approach to study the properties of quarkonium states are potential models where the possible relativistic effects for excited states of charmonium may also be incorporated there . at zero temperature , the potential model has made great success . at finite temperature , the essence of the potential model in the context of deconfinement is to use a finite temperature extension of the potential .",
    "quantitative understanding of the bound state properties needs the exact potential at finite temperature which , in principle , should be derived directly from qcd , like the cornell potential at zero temperature has been derived from pnrqcd from the zeroth - order matching coefficient .",
    "such derivations at finite temperature for weakly - coupled plasma have been recently come up in the literature  @xcite but they are , however , plagued by the existence of temperature - driven hard as well as soft scales , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , respectively . due to these difficulties in finite temperature extension in effective field theories ,",
    "the lattice - based potentials become popular . however",
    ", neither the free energy nor the internal energy can be directly used as the potential .",
    "in fact , what kind of screened potentials should be used in the schrdinger equation which describes well the bound states at finite temperature are still an open question .",
    "however , recently more involved calculations of quarkonium spectral functions and meson current correlators obtained from potential models have been performed and compared to first - principle qcd calculations performed numerically on lattices  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties of the correct form of the finite - temperature potential , there are also arbitrariness of the criteria of dissociation . besides the binding energy for a particular potential as an criterion of dissociation , the decay width is another important quantity to determine the dissociation of the bound states .",
    "the calculation based on a real - valued potential model does not include the true width of a state . by performing an analytical continuation of the euclidean wilson loop to minkowski space",
    ", the potential has an imaginary part due to landau damping which clearly broadens the peak  @xcite and facilitates the early dissociation of the bound states .    in the rhic or lhc era ( small @xmath10 )",
    ", recent lattice studies have confirmed that the transition from nuclear matter to qgp is not a phase transition , rather a crossover@xcite .",
    "the large distance property of the heavy quark interaction is important for our understanding of the bulk properties of the qcd plasma phase , _",
    "e.g. _ the screening property of the quark gluon plasma @xcite , the equation of state @xcite etc . in these studies , deviations from perturbative calculations and the ideal gas behavior",
    "are found beyond the deconfinement temperature .",
    "it is then reasonable to assume that the string - tension does not vanish abruptly at the deconfinement point  @xcite , so one should study its effects on heavy quark potential even above @xmath11 .",
    "this issue , usually overlooked in the literature where only a screened coulomb potential was assumed above @xmath11 and the linear / string term was assumed zero , was certainly worth investigation .",
    "recently a heavy quark potential at finite temperature was derived by correcting the full cornell potential , not its coulomb part alone , with a dielectric function encoding the effects of the deconfined medium  @xcite .",
    "this was found to have an additional long range coulomb term , in addition to the conventional yukawa term . in the short distance limit",
    ", the potential is reduced to vacuum potential , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath12 pair does not see the medium , giving rise the duality between @xmath13 and @xmath14 . on the other hand , in the large distance limit ( where the screening occurs )",
    ", potential is reduced to a long - range coulomb potential with a dynamically screened - color charge .",
    "thereafter the binding energies and dissociation temperatures of the ground and the lowest - lying states of charmonium and bottomonium spectra have been determined  @xcite which matches with the finding of recent works based on potential models  @xcite with the debye mass extracted from the lattice free energy . however ,",
    "when the debye mass in leading - order was used , the results  @xcite match with the lattice correlator studies or with the stronger ( lattice ) binding potential , i.e. internal energy  @xcite . in a way , their findings address the reason of arbitrariness of the results on dissociation temperatures  @xcite and ensues a basic question about the nature of dissociation of quarkonium in a hot qcd medium .",
    "however , all the works described above was limited to an isotropic medium but the partonic system generated in an ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions can not be homogeneous and isotropic because at the very early time of collision , asymptotic weak - coupling enhances the longitudinal expansion substantially than the radial expansion so the system becomes colder in the longitudinal direction than in the transverse direction . as a result , an anisotropy in the momentum space sets in and",
    "causes the parton system produced unstable with respect to the chromomagnetic plasma modes  @xcite which facilitate to isotropize the system  @xcite . in our work , we restricted ourselves to a _",
    "weakly anisotropic medium _",
    "because by the time ( @xmath15 = @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the quarkonium formation time in its rest frame ) quarkonia are formed in the plasma , the plasma becomes almost equilibrated .",
    "motivated with this preamble on the anisotropy generated in the very stage of collision , we wish to investigate the effect of weak anisotropy on the heavy - quark potential and subsequently on the dissociation of quarkonia states in an anisotropic medium .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section  [ poten ]",
    ", we will discuss the medium modifications to a heavy quark potential both in isotropic and anisotropic medium .",
    "in sec.[iso ] , we start with the in - medium modification to the heavy quark potential in an isotropic medium and then extend it to a medium which exhibits a local anisotropy in momentum space in sec.[aniso ] .",
    "to do that , we first obtain the self - energy tensor for an anisotropic medium to obtain the hard - loop resumed gluon propagator .",
    "thereafter the dielectric permittivity be obtained in terms of retarded gluon propagator and its fourier transform at vanishing frequency gives the desired non - relativistic potential at finite temperature .",
    "the potential thus obtained depends not only on the relative separation of @xmath12 pair but also on their relative orientation with respect to the direction of anisotropy and is found always deeper than in an isotropic medium .",
    "it is found that in the weak - anisotropy limit , the correction arising due to anisotropy to the isotropic part of the potential is small and thus has been treated as a perturbation .",
    "so , using the first - order perturbation theory , we estimate the shift in energy eigen values due to the small anisotropic correction to the energy eigen values from the spherically - symmetric part in isotropic medium and determine their dissociation temperatures in sec.3 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "potential models are based on the assumption that the interaction between a heavy quark and its anti - quark can be described by a potential . at @xmath18 , the hierarchy of well separated energy - scales : @xmath19 , allows one to systematically integrate out the different scales and obtain the non - relativistic potential qcd ( pnrqcd ) where the cornell potential indeed shows up as the zeroth - order matching coefficient  @xcite .",
    "inspired by its success at zero temperature , the potential model has been applied at finite temperature , with the main assumption that medium effects can be accounted by a temperature - dependent potential .",
    "recent lattice results  @xcite indicate the phase transition in full qcd appears to be a crossover rather than a ` true ' phase transition with the related singularities in thermodynamic observables . in light of the above findings",
    ", one can not simply ignore the effects of string tension between the quark - anti - quark pairs beyond @xmath11 .",
    "this is indeed a very important effect which needs to be incorporated while setting up the criterion for the dissociation .",
    "recently this issue has successfully been addressed for the dissociation of quarkonium in qgp by one of us  @xcite and we closely follow their work in brief .",
    "let us now start with a heavy quark potential ( cornell potential ) at t=0 @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the phenomenological parameters .",
    "the former accounts for the effective coupling between a heavy quark and its anti - quark and the latter gives the string coupling .",
    "the medium modification enters through the fourier transform of heavy quark potential as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fourier transform ( ft ) of the cornell potential which requires a regularization .",
    "we regulate both terms in the potential by multiplying with an exponential damping factor and is switched off after the ft is evaluated .",
    "this can be done by assuming @xmath25- as distribution ( @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "the ft of the linear part @xmath28 is @xmath29 after putting @xmath30 , we obtain the ft of the linear term @xmath31 as , @xmath32 and for the full cornell potential , the ft is @xmath33 the dielectric permittivity , @xmath34 is given in terms of the static limit of the longitudinal part of the gluon self - energy  @xcite .",
    "in isotropic case , it can be decomposed into longitudinal ( @xmath35 ) and transverse ( @xmath36 ) components which , in the static limit , are associated with the screening of electric and magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "however , in the static limit , the transverse part @xmath37 vanishes , _",
    "i.e. _ , static magnetic fields are not screened . in perturbation theory , the quantity that enters in the fourier transform of the potential at finite temperature is the static limit of the longitudinal gauge boson self - energy which was calculated long ago  @xcite at one loop level @xmath38 where @xmath39 is defined as the screening mass .",
    "since the static limit of the self - energy is momentum independent , the pole of the inverse of dielectric permittivity is simply the gauge invariant debye mass @xmath40 , so it leads to an exponential damping of the potential @xmath41 . in particular",
    ", this form of @xmath42 has the consequence that gluons screen the strong interaction , in contrast to the zero temperature case , over long - distance scale .",
    "if one assumes non - perturbative effects such as the string tension which survives even above the deconfinement point  @xcite then the dependence of the dielectric function on the debye mass may get modified .",
    "however , we assume the same screening mass scale @xmath43 which emerges in the debye screened coulomb potential also appears in the non - perturbative long - distance contribution due to string . in the following section ,",
    "we take over this assumption to anisotropic medium too .",
    "however , different scales for the coulomb and linear pieces of the t=0 potential , rather than a single one , was already employed in ref .",
    "moreover , they developed a theoretical model to include non - perturbative effects beyond the deconfinement temperature through dimension - two gluon condensates to calculate the heavy quark free energy .",
    "interestingly , their model predicts a duality between the zero temperature @xmath12 potential and the quark self energy and explains the lattice data well .",
    "finally , one can define a dielectric permittivity in one - loop by @xmath44 after substituting the dielectric permittivity in the fourier transform of cornell potential ( [ eq1 ] ) and then evaluating its inverse ft , one obtains the medium modified potential in the co - ordinate space  @xcite @xmath45 with the dimensionless variable @xmath46 .",
    "the constant terms are introduced to yield the correct limit of @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "such terms could arise naturally from the basic computations of real time static potential in hot qcd  @xcite and also from the real and imaginary time correlators in a thermal qcd medium  @xcite .",
    "the medium modified potential thus obtained has an additional long range coulomb term with an ( reduced ) effective charge , in addition to the conventional yukawa term .",
    "in the small distance limit , @xmath49 , the above potential reduces to the cornell potential , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath12 does not see the medium . on the other hand , in the screening region @xmath50 , the potential ( [ defn ] ) reduces to @xmath51 which , apart from a constant term , looks like a coulomb potential encountered in hydrogen - atom problem after identifying the fine structure constant @xmath52 with the effective charge @xmath53 .",
    "the binding energies and the dissociation temperatures for quarkonium states can thus be determined by solving the schrdinger equation numerically either with the full potential ( [ defn ] ) or analytically with the approximated form ( [ lrp ] ) . in addition",
    ", one can also exploit the advantage to demonstrate the flavor dependence of the dissociation process where the dissociation temperatures for 2-flavor are found to be higher than the 3-flavor case  @xcite .        to study the perturbative potential with an anisotropic parton distribution , consider a hot qcd plasma which , due to expansion and finite ( momentum ) relaxation time , manifests a local anisotropy in momentum space through the distribution function @xmath54 _ i.e. _ , @xmath55 is obtained from an isotropic distribution @xmath56 by removing particles with a large momentum component along the direction of anisotropy , @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to a plasma close to equilibrium and so that @xmath58 is either a bose - einstein @xmath59 or a fermi - dirac @xmath60 distribution function .",
    "this may be true because by the time quarkonia have been formed in the plasma medium from the @xmath12 pairs produced at very early stages of the collision , the system may not be then highly anisotropic rather closer to isotropic distribution .",
    "in the limit of small anisotropy , anisotropy parameter @xmath61 is related to the shear viscosity - to - entropy density ( @xmath62 ) through the one - dimensional navier stokes formula by @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the expansion rate of the fluid element . however , the degree of momentum - space anisotropy is generically defined by the parameter , @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the components of momentum parallel and perpendicular to the direction of anisotropy , @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the positive and negative values of @xmath68 corresponds to the squeezing and the stretching of the distribution function in the direction of anisotropy , respectively . in the relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "@xmath69 is however , found to be positive .",
    "the calculation of the real part of the potential at finite anisotropy was first obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and was later extended to calculate the imaginary part  @xcite which is seen as a generic feature of the medium . to study the effect of anisotropy on the in - medium potential , one need to calculate first the self - energy in an anisotropic medium . with the specified anisotropic distribution function , we can compute the gluon self - energy analytically  @xcite .",
    "we will restrict our consideration to the spatial part of the self - energy , @xmath70 for simplicity and the time - like components can be easily obtained by using the symmetry and transversality of the gluon self - energy tensor .",
    "the spatial components of the retarded self - energy tensor reads   @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the four momentum of the external gluon , @xmath73 is the amplitude of the spatial momentum . the four - velocity , @xmath74 @xmath75 is a light - like four vector with @xmath76 and the partial - derivative , @xmath77 , in terms of new variable @xmath78 , is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 . after integrating out over the modified momentum @xmath81 ,",
    "the self - energy , @xmath82 is simplified into  @xcite @xmath83 where the square of the debye mass is defined by @xmath84 unlike in isotropic medium , the self - energy @xmath85 shows an extra dependence on the preferred anisotropic direction ( @xmath57 ) , therefore , it can no longer be decomposed into transverse and longitudinal parts rather it becomes a tensor @xcite with more basis vectors .",
    "so the self - energy tensor be decomposed into four structure functions as  @xcite @xmath86 where the coefficients @xmath21 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be determined for any value of @xmath90  @xcite . using these structure functions",
    ", one can find the gluon propagator in temporal axial gauge as  @xcite @xmath91 in order to see how the anisotropy affects the response to static electric field , we examine the propagator in the static limit ( @xmath92 ) . defining the masses in the static limit",
    "@xcite @xmath93 the gluon propagator becomes @xmath94}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can now factorize the denominator of the gluon propagator as @xmath95 where @xmath96 thus the dielectric permittivity for an anisotropic medium in the temporal axial gauge can be obtained from the definition  @xcite @xmath97 if the anisotropy is small , the pole masses ( [ mminus ] ) can be simplified , by retaining only the linear term in @xmath69 , into  @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the angle between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "so the explicit dependencies of @xmath102 on the anisotropy , in the small @xmath69 limit , are given by @xmath103 in the isotropic limit , all masses become zero except one ( @xmath104 ) , which is the only pole in the isotropic medium ( [ eqn2 ] ) .      once we have obtained the dielectric permittivity in anisotropic medium ( [ permittivity ] ) , we substitute it in the fourier transform ( [ eq1 ] ) and then evaluate its inverse fourier transform to obtain the medium modified potential in an anisotropic medium : @xmath105 after substituting the pole masses , @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( in the small @xmath69 limit ) from ( [ mplus ] ) , the potential becomes @xmath108}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & \\!\\!\\!\\!v_1({\\bf r},\\xi , t)+v_2({\\bf r},\\xi , t ) \\label{v1}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the medium - modified potential corresponding to short - distance coulombic and long - distance string term , respectively , can be rewritten as @xmath111 expanding the integrand in terms of the anisotropy parameter ( @xmath69 ) and retaining the term linear in @xmath69 ( weak - anisotropy limit , @xmath112 ) , @xmath113 can be written as @xmath114\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & v_1^{(1 ) } ( { r},\\xi = 0,t)+ v_1^{(2)}({\\bf r},\\xi , t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the isotropic and anisotropic contributions due to the medium modification of the coulomb term , respectively .",
    "similarly @xmath117 can be decomposed into isotropic and anisotropic parts : @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the isotropic and anisotropic contributions due to the medium modification of the linear term , respectively .",
    "let us now calculate them one - by - one .",
    "the isotropic part , @xmath115 of the coulomb term ( already calculated in ( [ defn ] ) ) is given by ( @xmath121 ) @xmath122 and the anisotropic part , @xmath116 is given by @xmath123 one immediately observes that unlike the isotropic part @xmath124 , momentum anisotropy ( @xmath125 ) causes the potential to depend on angle , in addition to inter - particle distance ( r ) . before deriving a general angular dependence",
    "we first illustrate the two cases which are especially interesting to grasp the effect of anisotropy on the heavy - quark potential .",
    "however they will be used further to derive the general angular dependence .",
    "first , we consider that @xmath126 is parallel to the direction of anisotropy , @xmath57 , where we have taken the direction of anisotropy @xmath57 along the @xmath127-axis and the angle between the @xmath25 and @xmath128 is @xmath129 .",

    "the potential is reduced to a long - range coulombic interaction after identifying the factor @xmath162 with the coupling ( @xmath192 ) of the interaction @xmath193 since the resulting potential is coulombic plus a subleading anisotropic contribution , it then has to satisfy the condition : @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the bohr radius and @xmath196 is the debye mass .",
    "since the bohr radius @xmath195 is proportional to @xmath197 , the above condition for the long - distance limit implies that @xmath198 should be greater than 1 . thus this inequality results in a condition on the debye mass and hence on the temperature .",
    "it is seen that the above condition is satisfied for the temperatures above the critical temperature ( @xmath199 ) for the charmonium states and above 1.6@xmath11 for the bottomonium states",
    ". the temperature ranges ( @xmath11 and 1.6@xmath11 ) for @xmath200 and @xmath201 states above which the effective potential looks coulombic are smaller than their respective dissociation temperatures and thus seems justified to approximate the potential in the long - distance limit . in the intermediate distance ( @xmath202 ) scale , the interaction becomes complicated and thus the potential does not look simpler in contrast to the asymptotic limits , so this limit needs to be dealt numerically with the full potential in a schrdinger equation .",
    "we have thus noticed overall that in the short distance limit , the potential have not been affected in the isotropic limit . on the contrary , in the long - distance limit",
    ", the momentum anisotropy transpires an angular dependence in the potential and gives rise a characteristic angular ( @xmath164 ) dependence between the relative separation ( @xmath203 ) and the direction of anisotropy ( @xmath57 ) . as a corollary",
    ", the quark pairs aligned along the direction of anisotropy feel more attraction than the transverse alignment because the inter - quark potential along the direction of anisotropy is screened less than the transverse alignment .",
    "however , the potential in the anisotropic medium is always stronger than in isotropic medium .    to see the effects of anisotropy",
    ", we have shown the potentials for @xmath12 pairs in an anisotropic medium in figures 1 and 2 , for @xmath175 ( parallel ) and @xmath176 ( perpendicular ) , respectively .",
    "the immediate observation common to all figures is that the inter - quark potential in anisotropic medium is always more attractive than in isotropic medium .",
    "this can be understood physically : in the small anisotropic limit , the anisotropic distribution function may be obtained from an isotropic distribution @xmath56 by removing particles with a large momentum component along @xmath57 _ i.e. _ @xmath204 .",
    "this transpires in the reduction of the number of partons ( around a static test heavy quark ) than in isotropic medium _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath205 . therefore",
    ", the ( effective ) debye mass always becomes smaller and results in less screening of the potential than in isotropic medium .",
    "and the right panel represents the contribution of coulomb , string and both together as a function of @xmath179 (= @xmath206 ) for quark pairs parallel to the direction of anisotropy , @xmath57.,title=\"fig:\",width=298,height=321 ] [ para_plot_a ]      and the right panel represents the contribution of coulomb , string and both together as a function of @xmath179 (= @xmath206 ) for quark pairs parallel to the direction of anisotropy , @xmath57.,title=\"fig:\",width=298,height=321 ] [ para_plot_b ]     .,title=\"fig:\",width=298,height=321 ] [ perp_plot_a ]     .,title=\"fig:\",width=298,height=321 ] [ perp_plot_b ]    the second observation is that the quark pairs aligned along ( @xmath175 ) the direction of anisotropy are stronger than aligned perpendicular ( @xmath176 ) to the direction of anisotropy because for the parallel alignment , the component of momentum to be removed is higher than the transverse alignment so the distribution function for the parallel alignment case contributing to the debye mass is smaller than the transverse alignment .",
    "hence the potential for parallel case will be screened less compared to the transverse case .",
    "however the difference between the two scenario will be not much different because the contributions to the debye mass from the partons having higher momenta are very small .    to understand the effect of linear term on the medium modified potential quantitatively , in addition to the coulomb term",
    ", we have plotted separately the medium modifications to the linear term , the coulomb term and their sum in the right panels of figure 1 and 2 , for parallel and transverse case , respectively .",
    "medium modification to the cornell potential contains two parts : one is due to the medium modifications of linear term ( @xmath31 ) and the other one is due to the medium modifications of coulomb term . as usually done in the literature , medium modification to the linear term does not arise because the string tension was assumed to be zero  @xcite at or beyond deconfinement temperature  @xcite .",
    "since string tension is found to be nonzero at @xmath11 rather it approaches zero much beyond @xmath11  @xcite and hence the medium modification to the linear term may be non - zero contribution to the potential even at temperatures beyond @xmath11 , although it is very small . in isotropic medium",
    ", medium modification to the linear term remains positive up to 2 - 3 @xmath11 , making the potential less attractive compared to @xmath18 .",
    "on contrast , in anisotropic case medium modification to the linear term becomes negative and the overall full potential becomes more attractive .",
    "as mentioned earlier we used the same screening scale for both the linear and coulombic terms in our calculation which does not look plausible .",
    "it would thus be interesting to see the effects of different scales for the coulomb and linear pieces of the t=0 potential  @xcite . to illustrate it graphically ,",
    "we have compared our results with their results ( in figure 3 ) for the isotropic case .",
    "the difference in the large distance limit arises due to the difference in the potential at infinity ( -@xmath207 ) so the potential in ref.@xcite is more attractive than our potential .",
    "to understand the in - medium properties of the quarkonium states , we need to model the heavy quark potential as a function of temperature and solve the resulting schrdinger equation .",
    "the potential thus obtained in anisotropic medium ( [ fullp ] ) , in contrast to the ( spherically symmetric ) potential in isotropic medium , is non - spherical and so one can not simply obtain the energy eigen values by solving the radial part of the schrdinger equation only because the radial part is no longer sufficient due to the angular dependence in the potential . other way to understand is that because of the anisotropic screening scale , the wave functions are no longer radially symmetric for @xmath125 .",
    "so one has to solve the potential in anisotropic medium through the schrdinger equation in three dimension .",
    "however , we have seen in the potential ( 55 ) that in the small @xmath69-limit , the spherically non - symmetric component @xmath171 is much smaller in comparison to spherically symmetric ( isotropic ) component @xmath47 and thus can be treated as perturbation .",
    "this can be understood physically : the tensorial ( non - sphericity ) nature of the potential in the co - ordinate space is arisen due to anisotropy in the momentum space .",
    "however , we are restricted to a plasma which is very much close to equilibrium because by the time quarkonium states are formed in the plasma around ( 1 - 2)@xmath11 , the plasma becomes almost isotropized .",
    "thus this weak ( momentum ) anisotropy ( @xmath185 ) transpires feeble angular dependence in the potential so the potential will be spherically abundant with a tiny non - spherical component .",
    "so we could treat the anisotropic component through the perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and the isotropic part should be handled numerically by the one - dimensional radial schrdinger equation .",
    "there are some numerical methods to solve the schrdinger equation either in partial differential form ( time - dependent ) or eigen value form ( time - independent / stationary ) by the finite difference time domain method ( fdtd ) or matrix method , respectively .",
    "however , we choose the matrix method to solve the stationary schrdinger equation with the isotropic part of the potential ( 55 ) in anisotropic medium . in this method , the schrdinger equation can be cast in a matrix form through a discrete basis , instead of the continuous real - space position basis spanned by the states @xmath208 . here the confining potential v is subdivided into n discrete wells with potentials @xmath209 such that for @xmath210 boundary potential , @xmath211 for @xmath212 . therefore for the existence of a bound state , there must be exponentially decaying wave function in the region @xmath213 as @xmath214 and has the form : @xmath215 +   q_{{}_e } \\exp [ \\gamma_{{}_{n+2}}(x - x_{n+1 } ) ] , \\ ] ] where , @xmath216 , @xmath217 and , @xmath218 .",
    "the eigenvalues can be obtained by identifying the zeros of @xmath219 .",
    "therefore , the corrected energy eigen value comes from the solution of schrdinger equation of the isotropic component @xmath220 , using the abovementioned matrix method plus the first - order perturbation due to the anisotropic component @xmath221 ( 55 ) through the quantum mechanical perturbation theory .",
    "the variations of the binding energies with the temperature are shown in figure  ( [ bind_jsi ] ) for @xmath2 and @xmath222 for different values of anisotropy parameter @xmath69 , to see the effect of anisotropy on the binding energies compared to the isotropic case .",
    "there are mainly two observations : first , as the anisotropy increases , the binding of @xmath12 pairs get stronger with respect to their isotropic counterpart because the potential becomes deeper with the increase of anisotropy due to weaker screening .",
    "it seems that the ( effective ) debye mass @xmath223 in an anisotropic medium is always smaller than in an isotropic medium . as a result the screening of the coulomb and string contribution",
    "are less accentuated and hence the quarkonium states become more stronger than in an isotropic medium .",
    "however , the effects of anisotropy on the excited states are not so pronounced compared to the ground states because they are generically weakly bound .",
    "secondly , there is a strong decreasing trend with the temperature .",
    "this is due to the fact that the screening becomes always stronger with the increase of temperature , so the potential becomes weaker compared to @xmath18 and results in early dissolution of quarkonia in the medium .",
    "our results on the temperature dependence of the binding energies show an agreement with the similar variations in other calculations  @xcite .    in our calculation",
    ", we use the debye mass ( @xmath224 ) obtained by fitting the ( color - singlet ) free energy in lattice qcd  @xcite where both one and two - loop expression  @xcite for coupling have been used to explore the effects of running coupling on the dissociation process .",
    "thus the study of the temperature dependence of the binding energies are poised to provide a wealth of information about the dissociation pattern of quarkonium states in an anisotropic thermal medium that can be used to determine the dissociation temperatures of different states in the next section .",
    "dissociation of a two - body bound state in an thermal medium can be understood qualitatively : when the binding energy of a resonance state drops below the mean thermal energy of a parton , the state becomes feebly bound .",
    "the thermal fluctuation then can easily dissociate by exciting them into the continuum .",
    "the spectral function technique in potential models defines the dissociation temperature as the temperature above which the quarkonium spectral function shows no resonance - like structures but the widths shown in spectral functions from current potential model calculations are not physical .",
    "the broadening of states with the increase in temperature is not included in any of these models . in ref.@xcite , the authors argued that one need not to reach the binding energy ( @xmath225 ) to be zero for the dissociation rather a weaker condition @xmath226 causes a state weakly bound .",
    "in fact , when @xmath227 , the resonances have been broadened due to direct thermal activation , so the dissociation of the bound states may be expected to occur roughly around @xmath227 .    using the binding energies calculated earlier in sec.3.1 ,",
    "the dissociation temperatures ( @xmath228 ) ( shown in table 1 ) are found minimum for the isotropic case and increase with the increase of anisotropy ( @xmath229 ) _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath2 is dissociated at @xmath230 in an isotropic medium while in an anisotropic medium with the anisotropies @xmath69=0.3 and 0.6 , they will survive higher temperatures , @xmath231 and @xmath232 , respectively .",
    "similarly the dissociation temperatures of @xmath222 for @xmath69=0.3 and 0.6 are @xmath233 and @xmath234 , respectively , corresponding to the value ( @xmath235 ) in an isotropic medium .",
    ".dissociation temperatures ( @xmath228 ) for the quarkonium states with one - loop qcd coupling [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally we wish to explore the effects of perturbative as well as non - perturbative contributions on the dissociation of quarkonia states qualitatively in terms of the debye mass . instead of lattice debye mass ( @xmath236 ) , if we use the leading - order debye mass ( @xmath237 ) , the screening of the potential will be much smaller and hence the binding energies ( @xmath238 ) will be enhanced substantially and results in the increase of the dissociation temperatures . on the other hand , if we include the non - perturbative corrections of order @xmath239 and @xmath240 to the leading - order debye mass  @xcite , the dissociation temperatures become unrealistically small which looks unfeasible .",
    "thus , this study provides us a handle to decipher the extent up to which and how much non - perturbative effects should be incorporated into the debye mass .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the dissociation of quarkonia by correcting the full cornell potential with a dielectric function embodying the effects of an weakly anisotropic medium where the in - medium modification causes less screening of the interaction and hence the potential gets stronger than in an isotropic medium .",
    "anisotropy further introduces a characteristic angular ( @xmath129 ) dependence to the potential in the coordinate space , in addition to the inter - particle separation @xmath25 , making it spherically non - symmetric and needs to be solved numerically by the three - dimensional schrdinger equation .",
    "however , in the small @xmath69-limit , the spherically non - symmetric component is much smaller in comparison to spherically symmetric component and can be treated in a perturbation theory and the symmetric ( isotropic ) component is solved numerically by one - dimensional radial schrdinger equation .",
    "so the corrected binding energy is obtained by the direction - independent shift due to the spherically non - symmetric component to the eigen values of spherically - symmetric potential .",
    "we have observed that the quarkonia states are always more bound and as a consequence , they survive higher temperature compared to the isotropic medium . our results are found relatively higher compared to similar calculation  @xcite , which may be due to the absence of three - dimensional medium modification of the linear term in their calculation .",
    "in fact , one - dimensional fourier transform of the cornell potential yields the similar form used in the lattice qcd in which one - dimensional color flux tube structure was assumed  @xcite .",
    "however , at finite temperature that may not be the case since the flux tube structure may expand in more dimensions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be better to consider the three - dimensional form of the medium modified cornell potential which has been done exactly in the present work .    in brief , @xmath241 is found to be dissociated at 1.38 @xmath11 and @xmath242 for @xmath69=0 and 0.6 , respectively whereas the corresponding temperatures for the @xmath222 state are @xmath235 and @xmath234 .",
    "moreover we explore the effects of perturbative as well as non - perturbative effects on the dissociation process qualitatively .",
    "_ for example _ , the perturbative result of debye mass gives much higher values of dissociation temperatures whereas the inclusion of non - perturbative corrections to it gives unrealistically smaller values .",
    "it may be important to note that in the weakly - coupled regime , the effects of ( non - perturbative ) terms _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath243 , @xmath244 etc . may be checked separately but in the strong - coupling regime , this may not be possible because they are no longer uncoupled .",
    "these findings envisage a basic question about the nature of dissociation of quarkonium in an anisotropic hot qcd medium .",
    "apart from the uncertainty of the correct form of the potential , there is an arbitrariness in the definition of dissociation temperature .",
    "so , in future , we wish to investigate the dissociation through the decay width of quarkonium bound states calculated from the imaginary part of the potential because it is now well understood that potential in thermal medium has always an imaginary component  @xcite .",
