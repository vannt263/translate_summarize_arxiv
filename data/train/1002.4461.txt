    "the relationship between the device performance and the channel length is demonstrated by calculating @xmath31 curve of n - doped gnr - fets as a function of the doped channel length while keeping the bias voltage @xmath14 at 0.01 v. as shown in fig .",
    "10c , the subthreshold swing @xmath26 of these doped gnr - fets decreases and the on / off current ratio increases exponentially .",
    "it can be seen that for good device performance with small @xmath26 value ( e.g. , below 100 mv / decade ) and high on / off current ratio ( e.g. , above 100 ) , the doped channel length should be longer than 5 nm .",
    "the minimum leakage current of those fets with the doped channels shorter than this critical length will be greatly enhanced by direct tunneling , which lowers the device performance .    besides ideal case",
    ", some more practice issues concerning gnr - based fets are discussed in recent theoretical works .",
    "for example , the effects of the various contact types and shapes on the performance of schottky - barrier - type gnr - fets have been investigated theoretically @xcite , which indicates that the semi - infinite normal metal can potentially provide promising performance .",
    "in addition , the effect of edge roughness and carrier scattering on gnr - fets have been studied @xcite .",
    "the presence of edge disorder significantly reduces on - state currents and increases off - state currents ( the on / off ratio decreases ) , and introduces wide variability across devices .",
    "these effects become weaker for gnrs with larger width and smoother edges",
    ". however , the band gap decreases with increasing width , thereby increasing the band - to - band tunneling mediated subthreshold leakage current even with perfect gnrs .",
    "obviously , without atomically precise edge control during fabrication , it is hard to get reliable and stable performance of gnr - fets .",
    "due to their unusual basic properties , gnrs as well as graphene are promising for a large number of applications @xcite , from spin filters @xcite , valley filters @xcite , to chemical sensors @xcite .",
    "gnrs can be chemically and/or structurally modified in order to change its functionality and hence its potential applications .",
    "in summary , we review the basic electronic and transport properties of graphene nanoribbons , and discuss recent theoretical and experimental progress on gnr - based field effect transistors from the viewpoint of device application . due to the interesting electronic and magnetic properties , gnrs have been demonstrated as a promising candidate material for future post - silicon electronics such as transport materials , field effect transistors , and spin injection or filter .",
    "more experimental efforts will focus on fabricating high quality nanoribbon samples with accurate control of the edge structures .",
