    "the primary purpose of this paper is to provide a quantitative basis for deciding if a given prediction from solar models agrees or disagrees with a measured value .",
    "we proceed by constructing solar models in which , for every model separately , each of 21 input parameters is drawn randomly from a corresponding probability distribution that describes our knowledge of the parameter .",
    "we evolve models with many different sets of input parameters and use the calculated distributions of different theoretical quantities to describe the statistical significance of comparisons between solar model predictions and helioseismological or neutrino measurements . to give an explicit example ,",
    "the calculated probability distribution of the surface helium abundance is determined by evolving many different solar models , each with its own set of 21 randomly chosen input parameters , and counting how many solar models yield helium abundances within each specified bin or range of values .",
    "the exquisite precision that has been obtained in helioseismology over the past decade and the revolutionary advances in understanding the properties of solar neutrinos make it appropriate to develop the best - possible analysis techniques .",
    "new and more powerful measurements of helioseismological parameters and of solar neutrinos will be available in the next decade .",
    "the monte carlo simulations described in this paper will help to position us to take full advantage of the new data .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the calculations described in this paper are the first systematic attempt to use monte carlo simulations to determine the uncertainties in solar model predictions of parameters measured by helioseismology .",
    "the helioseismological parameters we study are the depth of the convective zone , the surface helium abundance , and the profiles of the sound speed and density versus radius .",
    "@xcite used a less extensive monte carlo simulation , 1,000 solar models and 5 input parameters , to determine the principal uncertainties in solar neutrino predictions .",
    "the monte carlo simulations described in the present paper provide a quantitative statistical basis for deciding if solar model predictions agree , or disagree , with helioseismological measurements .",
    "we do not know of any other statistical measure of the agreement , or lack of it , between solar models and helioseismology .",
    "as astroseismology continues to develop , monte carlo simulations of the kind described in this paper will be necessary to determine the statistical measure of agreement between stellar models and astroseismological measurements .",
    "we provide in this paper the first full determination of the correlation coefficients of the predicted solar model neutrino fluxes , including correlations imposed by the evolution of the solar model as well as correlations introduced by specific input parameters .",
    "previous discussions of correlations between neutrino fluxes have mostly been based upon power - law approximations to the dependence of individual neutrino fluxes upon specific input parameters @xcite .",
    "the correlation coefficients determined here will make possible a simpler and somewhat more powerful analysis of solar neutrino propagation .    in subsequent papers",
    ", we will use the models calculated for this paper to discuss the uncertainties in quantities that require more extensive analysis to derive standard deviations .",
    "examples of the quantities that will be studied later include the shapes of the production probabilities versus radius for solar neutrino fluxes , the shape of the electron distribution versus radius , and the shape of the neutron distribution versus radius .",
    "these three quantities are all necessary for a precise analysis of solar neutrino oscillations .    at present , the uncertainties in the heavy element abundances on the surface of the sun represent the dominant uncertainties in the prediction with solar models of many quantities of interest .",
    "we therefore carry out simulations using three different choices for the heavy element abundances and their uncertainties ( see discussion below ) .",
    "we use the same uncertainties for non - composition parameters for all three choices of the heavy element abundances .",

    "si is usually used as reference element to link the photospheric and meteoritic abundance scales @xcite . as a result , a lower value of the photospheric si leads to an equal reduction of the meteoritic abundances of other important elements ( e.g. mg , s , ca , fe , ni ) .",
    "these new determinations use 3-d calculations ( not 1-d as in the previous calculations ) which solve the mhd equations consistently with radiative transfer and which correctly predict observed line widths .",
    "moreover , the new calculations frequently include non - lte effects ; observational effects such as blends are treated carefully .",
    "the net result is that for the new calculations the abundances inferred from molecular and atomic lines are generally in agreement , whereas this was often not the case in previous abundance studies .",
    "surprisingly , these new ( lower ) heavy element abundances , when included in solar model calculations , lead to best - estimate predictions for helioseismologically measured quantities like the depth of the convective zone , the surface helium abundance , and the radial distributions of sound speeds and densities that are in strong disagreement with the helioseismological measurements @xcite . so far there has not been a successful resolution of this problem ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "given what we know about the input parameters of the solar models , are the disagreements between solar models that incorporate the new abundances ( as summarized in @xcite , hereafter ags05 abundances ) and helioseismological measurements statistically significant ? and , if so , at what significance level ?",
    "the monte carlo calculations described in this paper are required to answer these questions .",
    "quite remarkably , the older ( higher ) heavy element abundances ( as summarized in @xcite , hereafter gs98 abundances ) lead to good agreement with helioseismological measurements when incorporated into precise solar models ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this subject , for now , it seems that ` better is worse . '    with this unclear situation regarding heavy element abundances , what is our best strategy to simulate the uncertainties in the surface chemical composition ?",
    "we hedge our bets .",
    "we simulate 5,000 solar models for both of the following cases : 1 ) adopt ags05 abundances using the perhaps optimistic uncertainties determined by @xcite and summarized in table  [ tab : abundanceuncertainties ] of this paper ; hereafter ags05-opt composition choice ; and 2 ) adopt gs98 recommended abundances but with conservative uncertainties given in table  [ tab : abundanceuncertainties ] of the present paper ; hereafter gs98-cons composition choice .",
    "these two cases represent our primary monte carlo simulation .",
    "in addition , we compute 1,000 solar models for a third hybrid case : 3 ) adopt the newer ags05 abundances but with conservative uncertainties ; we denote this option ags05-cons .",
    "our greatest fear in carrying out this project was that we would discover something that we wanted to change after we had calculated the 10,000 monte carlo models . in order to avoid this disaster",
    ", we went carefully over all the details by examining the outputs of many sets of small numbers of models ( 10 to 100 ) that were ultimately discarded , but which we used to refine the technical details of how we handled the simulations of input parameters and the calculations and analysis of solar models .",
    "based upon the preliminary calculations , we wrote a complete draft of the paper that described all the technical details and the results ( including tables and figures ) .",
    "we decided we needed to complete this exercise before running the 10,000 models to make sure that the results were understandable and self - consistent and that the simulations were indeed doing what we wanted them to do .",
    "although this is an unorthodox way to write a paper , it turned out to be essential for this project .",
    "we discovered using the preliminary models that we had to adjust some important technical aspects of our simulation .",
    "for example , we had to shift the mean of the log - normal distribution of the simulated heavy element composition variables so as to give the observed best - estimate composition value ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : zprimeshift ] ] ) .",
    "we had to make several adjustments in the size and distribution of the mesh points in our final models so as to make possible robust and automated helioseismological inversions .",
    "as we wrote up the results , we realized that there were additional things that we needed to print out and analyze or save .",

    "in the previous section we examined the distribution of the position of the cz base and the helium abundance of the models . while the cz base and helium abundance are two very important quantities obtained from helioseismic studies of the sun , there are by no means the only two .",

    "thus we have additional information about the sun with which to compare our models .",
    "we present in this section the monte carlo results for the comparison between the solar model and helioseismologically obtained solar sound - speed and density profiles .",
    "inversions to determine solar the solar sound - speed and density profiles are done by inverting the frequency differences between the sun and a solar model to obtain the sound - speed and density between the sun and the model ( called the `` reference model '' ) .",
    "thus inversions directly show us whether or not the structure of a solar model agrees with that of the sun .",
    "for this work , the frequency differences between the sun and the models were inverted using the subtractive optimally localized averages ( sola ) technique @xcite .",
    "we set up the inversion problem and determined the various parameters of the inversion in the manner described by @xcite . for the helioseismological data , we use solar oscillation frequencies obtained by the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) on board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) .",
    "in particular , we use frequencies obtained from mdi data that were collected for the first 360 days of its observation @xcite .",
    "this data set was chosen because it was derived from a long time series when solar activity was low . the length of the time series results in reduced noise and hence a larger number of modes for which the frequencies can be determined reliably .",
    "mode sets derived from longer data sets are available , but they only consist of low - degree modes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , a longer time series would have meant adding observations from periods of increasing solar activity , which would have changed the frequencies .",
    "it is a well - established fact that solar frequencies increase with solar activity .",
    "however , it is also known that increase is such that it does not reflect a change in structure of the solar interior @xcite . to quantize the difference between the structure of the sun and the models ,",

    "the internal structure of solar models is sensitive , at different depths , to different physical inputs in the calculations .",
    "for instance , the adopted solar composition has a more dramatic effect on the structure of the models for @xmath207 @xcite .",
    "of particular importance is how composition affects the location of the base of the solar convective envelope and how this affects the sound - speed profile in the region @xmath208 . in the temperature range in this region ,",
    "opacity is dominated by bound - free transitions and this largely determines the temperature gradient .",
    "higher metal abundances lead to higher opacities and a steeper radiative temperature gradient . as a result ,",
    "the condition for convective stability ( for which we adopt the schwarzschild criterion ) is satisfied at higher temperatures ( i.e. , a larger depth ) for a higher metallicity . given the sharp transition in temperature at the cz base , a mismatch in its location in the solar models with respect to the actual solar location gives rise to a large difference sound speed in that region . at inner regions , however , free - free transitions and electron scattering opacity sources become gradually more important , diminishing the influence of the details of the solar composition .",
    "this leads us to discuss our results for the sound speed profiles ( and analogously for the density profiles ) not only in terms of the rms sound speed difference @xmath209 over the entire range of validity of the inversion , but also in two smaller ranges , an inner rms @xmath210 defined for @xmath211 , and an outer sound speed difference rms @xmath212 defined for @xmath213 ( see also $  [ subsec : defnsigmaopacityeos ] ) .",

    "the tails extending to high rms values result from the adopted large conservative uncertainties . for the ags05-opt composition simulation the distributions peak at much higher values than in the gs98-cons case , reflecting the fact that the sound speed of the solar models constructed with this composition are not in good agreement with the sound speed profile inferred from helioseismology .",
