    "due to the efforts of a large number of researchers , it has been well - established that the self - consistent field theory ( scft ) of polymers provides a powerful theoretical framework for the study of inhomogeneous polymeric systems in general and the self - assembly behavior of block copolymers in particular@xcite . for a given block copolymer system",
    ", the scft can be efficiently describe its architecture , molecular composition , polydispersity , and block types as a series of parameters in the energy functional which is a nonlinear and nonlocal functional of the monomer densities and their conjugate fields .",
    "the equilibrium solutions of the scft energy functional correspond to the possible stable and metastable phases of the block copolymer system .",
    "they are determined by a set of the scft equations obtained by assigning the first variations of energy functional with respect to the density profiles and fields to zero .",
    "finding all solutions of the scft equations analytically is beyond today s technology , even for the simplest @xmath1 diblock copolymer system .",
    "a successful alternative is to solve the scft equations numerically .",
    "numerically solving the scft equations requires the analysis of the property of scft solutions , and even the mathematical structure of the scft energy functional .",
    "there have been a number of numerical techniques developed to solve scft equations , including from the perspective of three facets  the strategy of screening initial values@xcite , the numerical solver for the modified diffusion equation of chain propagators@xcite , and the iterative schemes for the convergence of the equations system@xcite .",
    "however , little work has been devoted to further analysing the mathematical structure of the scft even through it is well - known that the equilibrium solutions of the scft equations are saddle points@xcite . among these researches , fredrickson and co - workers@xcite",
    "have directly analysed the analytic structure of the field - based energy functional which does not use the mean - field approximation for incompressible polymeric systems .",
    "they utilized the hubbard - stratonovich transformation@xcite to decouple the particle - particle interaction , and pointed out that , for binary component system , the physical solutions represent saddle points in which the energy functional is minimized with respect to the exchange chemical potential , and maximized with respect to the pressure potential .",
    "it is the latter field that imposes the incompressibility constraint and produces the index-1 saddle point character of the problem .",
    "the analysis of the mathematical structure of the scft energy functional , or more generally , of the field functional , is very useful for the theoretical studies of polymer systems .",
    "for this reason , a series of theoretical tools have been developed including the efficient gradient - based iterative methods to solve the scft equations@xcite , the useful technique of partial saddle - point approximation translating the saddle point problem into extreme value problem@xcite , and the solving strategy for field theoretic simulation which involves numerically solving the exact partition function of polymer fluid models@xcite . due to the known information of the saddle point character",
    ", the scft model can be applied to the mean - field mesoscopic dynamics@xcite , and the nucleation theory of ordered phases in which the saddle point problem should be turned into a minimum problem firstly , followed by the string method@xcite .    on the other hand , in recent years",
    ", a large number of studies have been performed on the investigation of the phase behavior of multicomponent block copolymers because more chemically distinct blocks can offer opportunities to create a greater diversity of order phases and phase behaviors@xcite .",
    "because of the rapidly increasing parameters charactered the multicomponent block copolymer , the scft energy functional becomes more complex which also leads to a larger scale of scft equations system .",
    "this increases the difficulty of theoretical research and numerical simulations , and requires more theoretical analysis of the mathematical structure of the scft energy functional .",
    "for example , the recently developed nucleation theory of ordered phases within the scft using string method@xcite , it involves converting the saddle point problem of scft into a minimal value problem in each iteration by a priori knowledge of saddle point character .",
    "this approach has been restricted to diblock copolymers because of lack of analysis on the saddle point property of the scft energy functional of multicomponent copolymer systems . in the present paper , we will analyse the analytic structure of the scft energy functional of multicomponent block copolymer systems based on the work of fredrickson _ et al._. the adopted technique to use the hubbard - stratonovich transformation to decouple the particle - particle interaction , is not new , but it is the first time to analyse the scft energy functional of multicomponent ( more than @xmath2 ) block copolymers .",
    "the analytic structure of multicomponent block copolymer system is different from that of two - component polymer systems . in the latter system ,",
    "the saddle point of physical solution is caused by the incompressibility constraint@xcite .",
    "however , for multicomponent polymer systems , except for the incompressibility constraint , the existence of multiple non - bonded interactions will lead to high index saddle points with certain flory - huggins interaction parameters . in this work the influence of flory - huggins interaction parameters for saddle point character of the scft will be detailed analysed .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in sec.[sec : theory ] , we present the theoretical framework of the scft for multicomponent block copolymer system .",
    "meanwhile the saddle point properties of the scft energy functional will be analysed detailedly , especially considering the influence of different flory - huggins interaction parameters .",
    "we also take the @xmath0 triblock copolymers as a specific example to illustrate our theory in this section . in sec.[sec : method ] , as an application , we will extend the gradient - based iterative method , developed in diblock copolymers , to solve the scft equations of multicomponent block copolymer system .",
    "sec.[sec : results ] shows the corresponding numerical results to demonstrate the availability of our developed model and numerical methods , using @xmath0 star triblock copolymers model .",
    "the final section presents brief summary and some discussions on the proposed theory .",
    "the first ingredient in the scft of a polymeric fluid is a mesoscopic molecular model to describe the statistical mechanics associated with the conformational states of a single polymer . in order to describe the properties of polymer chains ,",
    "lots of coarse - grained polymer chain models have been developed for theoretic studies , such as continuous gaussian chain model for flexible polymers , wormlike chain model for semiflexible or rigid - rod polymers@xcite .",

    ", we are going to transform this particle - based statistical mechanism into the statistical field theory mainly through the hubbard - stratonovich transformation ( also named as gaussian functional integration technique ) that serves to decouple particle - particle interactions@xcite .      in order to use the hubbard - stratonovich transformation , we have to first transform the non - bonded interaction @xmath32 $ ] into the normalized form @xmath42 = - \\rho_0 \\int \\mathrm d \\bm r~ \\sum_{k } \\zeta_k \\cdot \\hat \\rho_k^2 ,    \\label{eq : norminteraction}\\ ] ] @xmath43 is the combination of the flory - huggins interaction parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the linear composition of microscopic monomer densities @xmath46 . applying local incompressibility condition @xmath47 , or equivalently @xmath48 , to the integrand of @xmath32 $ ] in , we have @xmath49 + l\\left [ \\hat \\rho_b(\\bm r ) , \\hat \\rho_c(\\bm r ) \\dots \\right ] ,    \\label{eq : quadraticform}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is a quadratic form and @xmath51 is a linear composition of @xmath52 ( appendix [ app : interenergy ] gives the derivation process ) .",

    "there are plenty of choices for coefficients @xmath43 and linear composition @xmath64 , however , these expressions essentially describing the same non - bonded interaction @xmath57 $ ] with the difference from each other being a constant .            for the purpose of implementing the saddle point approximation , it is important to get some understanding of the saddle point approximation , thereby examining the analytic structure of the partition function as well as the energy functional .",
    "we consider the following simple integral @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a contour in the complex plane , and @xmath90 is a real positive number . @xmath91 and",
    "@xmath92 , which are independent of @xmath90 , are analytic functions of @xmath93 in some domain of the complex plane including @xmath89 . as a convenient preliminary",
    ", we introduce the functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 corresponding to the real part of and imaginary part of @xmath92 by writing @xmath96 the problem is to find an asymptotic approximation for @xmath97 in the limit @xmath98 .",
    "we now exploit the fact that the contour @xmath89 in can be deformed , by cauchy s theorem , into other contour @xmath99 that shares the same end points , and have @xmath100 such reexpression of @xmath101 is useful only if the integral along @xmath99 is easier than the integral along @xmath89 . if @xmath102 , the so - called phase , is a constant along contour @xmath103 , there are no oscillations from @xmath104 . for illustrative purpose ,",

    "then we have @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the real part and @xmath112 is the imaginary part of the function @xmath113 .",
    "we deform the path @xmath89 into @xmath99 so that it passes through the saddle point @xmath114 ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) , where @xmath94 has its maximum value . by the laplace method@xcite , the major contributions to the integrals come from the neighbourhoods of the points of maximum @xmath116 in the range of integration , as @xmath117 .",
    "such a procedure is the basis of the steepest descent ( or saddle point ) method for the asymptotic analysis of integrals such as eqn.@xcite .",
    "we now return to @xmath97 given by with the given conditions on @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath90 to further observe the saddle point approximation .",
    "firstly we show that @xmath114 is indeed a saddle point of @xmath94 ( and of @xmath95 ) .",
    "a relative maximum of @xmath94 is given by @xmath120 . since @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath92 , an analytic function of @xmath93 , they satisfy the cauchy - riemann equations which are @xmath121 thus @xmath122 from , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are harmonic functions satisfying laplace s equation @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the laplacian operator @xmath125 . by the maximum modulus theorem , @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    "can not have a maximum or a minimum in the domain of analyticity of @xmath92 .",
    "thus the point @xmath114 is a saddle point of @xmath94 and of @xmath95 .",
    "subsequently we point out that this specific path @xmath99 through the point of maximum @xmath126 will be a path of steepest descents .",
    "assume that @xmath127 is the tangential vector along the contour @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath128 along @xmath99 , the following equation holds @xmath129 by cauchy - riemann equation , we have @xmath130 in fact , the vector @xmath131 is orthogonal to the @xmath132 , i.e. , @xmath133 , thus @xmath134 .",
    "that is for @xmath135 , along @xmath99 ( @xmath136 ) , @xmath94 drops off on either side of its maximum as rapidly as possible .",
    "what is more , when we concern with saddle points of order one , that is @xmath115 , @xmath137 , there exists another contour @xmath138 passing through @xmath114 along which @xmath139 is also a constant@xcite .",
    "the contours @xmath99 and @xmath138 are orthogonal to each other along which @xmath94 changes as rapidly as possible .",
    "assume that @xmath140 , and @xmath141 as a consequence , at the saddle point @xmath114 , @xmath142 thus the contour @xmath138 corresponds not to the steepest descent path but to the steepest ascent path since the value of @xmath94 on it is such that @xmath143 except at @xmath114 .",
    "the above results are valid for multidimensional cases@xcite .",
    "there are also a few researches for infinite - dimensional cases@xcite .",
    "we now return to the field model of multicomponent block copolymer system which is a functional integral . strictly speaking",
    ", it is a quite challenge to find the constant phase contour @xmath99 for such a complicated infinite dimensional integral .",
    "however , for numerical purpose the fields are represented in a discrete way and the functional integral is approximated by multiply integrals of finite , but large , dimension .",
    "thus the above heuristic discussions about the saddle point approximation are useful , at least conceptually , to determine the qualitative location and orientation of a saddle point in the complex plane .",
    "the first thing is to verify the possibility of applying saddle point approximation to model .",
    "it is easily verified that the statistical weight @xmath144)$ ] is analytic functional of fields @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "thus , the deformation of integration path is conceptually possible .",
    "the original path of integration of the fields @xmath145 , @xmath146 in the partition function of is along the real axis . nevertheless , for analytic integrands @xmath147)$ ] , it is useful to deform the integration path onto a constant phase that passes through one or more saddle points @xmath148 $ ] in the multi - dimensional complex plane .",
    "the phase factor @xmath149 is a constant along such a contour , so that oscillations of the integrand are eliminated .",
    "a functional integral deformed onto a constant phase contour is dominated by saddle point field configurations , @xmath150 $ ] , which correspond to mean - field solutions . on the constant phase contour , @xmath151 ,",
    "the real part of @xmath152 $ ] , has local minima at the saddle points .",
    "the extent to which one of these saddle point field configurations dominates the integral depends on the value of a `` ginzburg parameter '' analogous to @xmath90 in the above discussion .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to show that the coordination number @xmath153 is the relevant parameter@xcite , where @xmath154 denotes the radius of gyration of a polymer .",
    "it follows that the mean - field approximation becomes asymptotically exact for @xmath155 .",
    "since polymers are asymptotically ideal in the melt with @xmath156 , it follows that @xmath157 .",
    "thus the saddle point approximation is accurate for concentrated solutions or melts of high - molecular - weight polymers .",
    "the requirement that the energy functional @xmath148 $ ] be real implies that @xmath80 , @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) must be imaginary , and @xmath158 ( @xmath160 ) must be real , respectively .",
    "it is often convenient to compute a purely imaginary saddle point by a relaxation scheme along the imaginary axis , which is a search direction that is orthogonal to the physical path of integration .",
    "with such a scheme , it is important to recognize that it is more than likely a descent - ascent direction for the real part of the energy functional @xmath161 $ ] .",
    "thus finding a saddle point of @xmath161 $ ] , corresponding to the scft solution , shall be maximized with respect to the fields @xmath82 and @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) , and minimized with respect to the `` exchange chemical potentials '' @xmath162 ( @xmath164 ) . thus the gradient - based iterative methods , based on the orientation of saddle points of the energy functional , can be devised to solve the scft equations - .",
    "the scft equations - have multiply solutions corresponding to more than one saddle point , which present the stable and metastable phases for polymer fluids .",
    "inhomogeneous saddle points of interest normally require numerical iterative techniques . within the mean - field theory , only in the vicinity of a saddle point , the orientation of the saddle point can be determined , as discussed above .",
    "thus initial configurations shall be close to the desired saddle point in numerical computations",
    ".    the above analysis will be helpful to translate the saddle point problem into a extreme problem for multicomponent block copolymer system . for binary component",
    "incompressible polymer systems , to find saddle points , one should seek a local maximum along the exchange chemical potential @xmath165 , and a local minimum along the pressure potential @xmath82@xcite .",
    "the latter field is produced by the incompressibility constraint .",
    "then the energy functional @xmath166 $ ] can be computed by @xmath167=h[\\mu_-]$ ] when satisfying the incompressibility condition .",
    "that is the `` partial mean - field approximation''@xcite which translates the saddle point problem into a minimum value problem .",
    "the `` partial mean - field approximation '' is useful for the nucleation theory of ordered phases@xcite and the mesoscopic dynamics@xcite .",
    "it is different from the multicomponent incompressible polymer systems . in these models ,",
    "the incompressibility condition @xmath168 $ ] is also the unique constraint condition , however , the nature of the saddle point may come from the non - bond flory - huggins interaction parameters @xmath44",
    ". when all parameters @xmath43 , the combination of @xmath44 , are positive , the scft solutions are local minima of @xmath169=h[\\bm\\mu]$ ] .",
    "once there exist one or more parameters such that @xmath170 , the scft solutions are still saddle points of @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "thus for multicomponent polymer systems , the original `` partial mean - field approximation '' can not avoid saddle point problem .",
    "it requires the new `` partial mean - field approximation '' , @xmath171 $ ] to translate the saddle point problem into a minimum value problem .",
    "it follows that the string method can be applied to study the nucleation of ordered phases for multicomponent block copolymers .",
    "though continuous gaussian chain model is considered here , extension to more complicated systems , for example rod - coil block copolymers and liquid crystalline side - chain copolymers with the wormlike chain model should be straight forward .",
    "direct extensions can also be easily applied to grand canonical ensemble and compressible systems .        as discussed in the above subsection",
    ", the value of @xmath43 influences the saddle point character of the scft . in the following , we will analyse the expression of the scft for different @xmath43 . without loss of generality",
    ", we will assume @xmath180 , @xmath181 .",
    "the similar case of @xmath182 or @xmath183 can be discussed in the same way .",
    "the above scft system is closed by combining with the single - chain partition function @xmath72 of ( [ eqn : singlepar ] ) , density @xmath73 ( [ eqn : density ] ) and the forward and backward propagators of mdes - .",
    "the topological structure of the block copolymer chain determines the initial values of mdes@xcite . for the @xmath0 linear triblock copolymer chain , @xmath194 for the @xmath0 star triblock copolymer chain , @xmath195 where @xmath196 .",
    "in the preceding discussions , we have been analysed the analytic structure of the scft energy functional of multicomponent polymer systems , which enables us to cast light on the orientation of the saddle points corresponding to the scft solutions .",
    "thus the existing gradient - based methods can be planted into multicomponent polymer systems .",
    "essentially the scft equations are a set of highly nonlinear equations with multi - solutions and multi - parameters .",
    "it requires iterative techniques to solve the complicated system . for given parameters @xmath44 , @xmath197 , and fixed the calculation box , the specific iteration processes for the self - consistent systems are given in the following :    step 1 : :    give the initial values of chemical potential fields ; step 2 : :    solve propagators to obtain single partition function @xmath72    and density operators @xmath73 ; step 3 : :    update potential fields @xmath198 through iterative    methods ; step 4 : :    if a given convergent condition is achieved , stop iteration procedure ,    else goto * step 2*.    the numerical search for equilibrium ordered structures depends on the initial conditions .",
    "a series of effective strategies have been developed for screening initial values to discover ordered patterns@xcite .",
    "the subsequently numerical experiments will utilize these strategies to screen initial configurations .",
    "evaluating the energy functional and first derivatives of the self - consistent field models requires an efficient numerical method to solve mdes ( [ eqn : qmde ] ) and ( [ eqn : qplusmde ] ) for propagators . the forth - order accurate adams - bashford scheme with the pseudospectral technique@xcite is our method of choice , @xmath199 .",
    "\\label{eqn : adams}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the initial values required to apply the multi - step scheme of ( [ eqn : adams ] ) are obtained by using second - order operator - splitting scheme@xcite and richardson s extrapolation .",
    "the expressions for the derivatives of the energy functional are linearly related to density operators , which are , in turn , nonlinearly and nonlocally related to the propagators @xmath200 and @xmath201 by expressions of ( [ eqn : qmde ] ) and ( [ eqn : qplusmde ] ) .",
    "these expressions are most conveniently evaluated in real space at the collocation points of the basis functions . in particular , the composite simpson s rule with forth - order truncation error ( see ref.@xcite , p.134 ) is utilized in our numerical implementation .",

    "thus gradient - based iterative methods , such as the explicit forward euler method , hybrid method@xcite , and the semi - implicit method@xcite , can be extended to update chemical potential fields of the scft energy functional for multicomponent block polymer systems .      * hybrid conjugate gradient method ( hcg)*. the second explicit method is the hybrid scheme , firstly developed by liang _ _ et al.__@xcite for flexible - semiflexible diblock copolymer system .",
    "the conjugate gradient method is normally unstable in the scft simulations@xcite .",
