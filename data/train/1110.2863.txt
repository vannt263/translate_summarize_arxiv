    "the goal of this talk is to discuss various intriguing aspects of the spectrum of scalar - isoscalar states .",
    "approaches developed in recent years may shed new light on this long - elaborated problem in hadronic physics .",
    "subsequent hadron resonances listed in the particle data group ( pdg ) tables increase their mass up to the upper experimental limit of 2.5  gev , while their width remains bound within 500  mev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gam - m - mes ] we show separately the widths of all baryons and mesons listed in the pdg tables  @xcite as functions of the mass of the state .",
    "one naturally expects that broad resonances , i.e. , with @xmath5 , escape phenomenological analysis ; even if they existed , they might be missing from the pdg as difficult to assess experimentally . note , however , that with the exception of the notorious @xmath2 resonance and a few baryon and meson states , the ratio is bound by the line @xmath6 ( the dashed line in fig .  [ fig : pmes ] ) .",
    "a natural and model - independent framework to understand this feature is provided by the limit of large number of colors in qcd . indeed , in this large-@xmath1 limit",
    ", with @xmath7 fixed , baryons are heavy with mass @xmath8 and width @xmath9  @xcite , while mesons and glueballs are stable , with mass independent of @xmath1 , namely @xmath10 , and width @xmath11 suppressed as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "this means that @xmath14 is suppressed ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "in particular , one has @xmath15 for mesons and baryons , while @xmath16 for glueballs .",
    "suggests that it is reasonable to assume that excited states in the spectrum follow a more accurate large-@xmath1 pattern than the ground state . ]",
    "spin degeneracy , while the intensity is proportional to the isospin degeneracy @xmath17.,title=\"fig : \" ] spin degeneracy , while the intensity is proportional to the isospin degeneracy @xmath17.,title=\"fig : \" ]    on the other hand , at high excitations mesons are expected to resemble strings of length @xmath18 , with @xmath19 denoting the string tension ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "actually , the decay rate of a string per unit time , @xmath11 , is estimated to be proportional to the length  @xcite , which immediately yields constant @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmes ] we show the ratio of widths to masses of _ all _ baryons and mesons listed in the pdg tables  @xcite , plotted as functions of the mass of the state .",
    "if we compute the average weighted with the @xmath20 spin degeneracy and its spread , we find ( @xmath21 are the remaining quantum numbers , including isospin ) @xmath22 for both baryons and mesons ! this rather small ratio , complying to the large-@xmath1 and string - model arguments , suggests that this is a generic feature of the hadronic spectrum rather than a lack of experimental ability to resolve too broad states .",
    "one may thus assert in this regard that the pdg spectrum is fairly complete .     for the width / mass ratio .",
    "the large-@xmath1 limit predicts @xmath23 .",

    "a resonance may be interpreted as a superposition of states with a given mass distribution , approximately spanning the @xmath25 interval .",
    "of course , the shape of the distribution depends on the particular process where the resonance is produced , and thus on the background .",
    "the rigorous quantum - mechanical definition of the resonance corresponds to a pole in the second riemann sheet in the partial - wave amplitude of the corresponding decay channel , which becomes independent of the background .",
    "however , although quoting the pole is highly desirable , with a few exceptions this is _ not _ what one typically finds in the pdg .    as a matter of fact",
    ", several definitions are used : pole in the second riemann sheet , pole in the @xmath26-matrix , breit - wigner resonance , maximum in the speed plot , time delay , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , while all these definitions converge for narrow resonances , even for broad states we expect the masses to be compatible within their corresponding @xmath27 intervals .",
    "as mentioned , the values listed in the pdg for a given resonance correspond to different choices and/or processes , but mostly the results are compatible within the estimated width differences .",
    "the lowest resonance in qcd is the @xmath3 state @xmath2 or the @xmath28meson .",
    "it appears as a complex pole in the second riemann sheet of the @xmath29 scattering amplitude at @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . while these are remarkably accurate , it is unclear whether these numbers can be directly used in hadronic physics .",
    "an analysis of the role played by the @xmath19 as a correlated @xmath33 exchange in the central component to the @xmath34 force shows that the complex - pole exchange does not accurately describe this effect in the range @xmath35 , but prefers a value in between the pole and the breit - wigner approximation , @xmath36  mev  @xcite .",
    "the breit - wigner parameters are @xmath37  mev  @xcite . for the time delay method",
    "we obtain @xmath38  mev . as we see , the different determinations agree within the wide @xmath39 interval .",
    "scalar - isoscalar and @xmath40 pseudoscalar - isovector states listed in the pdg tables  @xcite .",
    "the four heaviest @xmath3 and two @xmath41 states are not yet well established and are omitted from the pdg summary tables .",
    "the error bars correspond to the errors in the determination of the square of mass as @xmath42 with @xmath11 from  @xcite .",
    "the straight line is the result of our joined fit .",
    "labels of @xmath3 states are above their mark whereas labels of @xmath4 states are below their mark . ]",
    "higher @xmath3 states listed in the pdg  @xcite follow roughly the general pattern of increasing mass but not their width . radial and rotational regge trajectories were analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for scalar states",
    "@xcite two parallel radial trajectories could then be identified , including three states per trajectory . in a recent work  @xcite",
    "( see also  @xcite ) we have analyzed all the @xmath3 states which appear in the pdg tables ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : regge - trajectory ] ) and found that _ all _ fit into a single radial regge trajectory of the form @xmath43 the mass of the @xmath19 state can be deduced from this trajectory as the mass of the lowest state .",
    "the resonance nature of these states suggests to use the corresponding half - width as the mass uncertainty in the @xmath44 fit : @xmath45 minimization yields @xmath46 , with @xmath47 formula ( [ eq : masss ] ) is actually equivalent to two parallel radial regge trajectories with the _ standard _ slope , @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and @xmath19 is the string tension associated to the potential @xmath50 between heavy colored sources .",
    "the value @xmath51 obtained from our fit agrees well with lattice determinations of @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "of course , one expects some of these states to correspond eventually to glueballs",
    ". however , there seems to be no obvious difference between mesons and glueballs , as far as the radial regge spectrum is concerned .",
    "note that casimir scaling suggests that the string tension is @xmath53 , but this holds in the case of fixed and heavy sources .",
    "the fact that we have light quarks might explain why we can not allocate easily the casimir scaling pattern in the light - quark scalar - isoscalar spectrum .",
    "for scalar states a measure of the spectrum is given in terms of the ( gauge and renorm invariant ) trace of the energy momentum tensor  @xcite @xmath54 \\bar q q .",

    "it is interesting to consider the situation of massless quarks , where things become somewhat simpler .",
    "then , we have in principle two scalar operators with smallest canonical dimensions , the gluon @xmath60 and the quark @xmath61 . while these two operators are both scalars , they are chirally even and odd , respectively ,",
    "i.e. , under the @xmath62 transformation .",
    "because the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , there is some mixing between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these operators connect scalar states to the vacuum through the matrix element @xmath63 the two - point correlators read @xmath64 where in the r.h.s .",
    "we saturate with scalar states and @xmath65 stands for subtraction constants which can chosen as to replace @xmath66 in the numerator . in that scheme , in the large @xmath67 limit , a comparison with the operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite leads to the matching conditions @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "as we see , @xmath61 and @xmath60 do not mix at high @xmath72 values , a consequence of asymptotic chiral symmetry  @xcite . in these limits the sums over @xmath73 can be replaced by integrals , whence the following asymptotic conditions are found : @xmath74 we see that the first two conditions are incompatible with the third one if @xmath75 increases for large @xmath73 , as is the case of the data . however , if we group the states in two families , as suggested by eqs .",
    "( [ traj-2 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : regge - trajectory ] , we get a compatible solution @xmath76 this is equivalent to assuming an asymptotically alternating pattern of mesons and glueballs , coupling to chirally odd and even operators , @xmath61 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "since asymptotically @xmath77 , we find @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "of course , this is not the only solution .",
    "the situation described above suggests the existence of a hidden symmetry in the @xmath3 sector . in our case",
    "we could think of the @xmath80-parity ( which becomes a good quantum number for excited states ) as the relevant symmetry which makes the difference between the chirally even and odd states .",
    "this , however , only explains the fact that asymptotically the slopes of the @xmath81 and @xmath82 branches are the same , but not why the intercepts accurately differ by half the slope .",
    "to further elaborate on this intriguing point of the accidental degeneracy , let us consider the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath83 , as an example ; all states @xmath84 with the energy @xmath85 can be separated into parity _ even _ and parity _ odd _ states , satisfying the conditions @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , and having the energies @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "these formulas display _ twice _ the slope of @xmath90 .",
    "thus , given the states with energies @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we might infer that parity was a hidden symmetry of a hamiltonian explaining the correlation between the slope and intercepts .",
    "in the relativistic case the argument can also be made in a suggestive manner .",
    "let us consider the klein - gordon action for infinitely many bosons in four dimensions , described with fields @xmath93 of masses @xmath94 : @xmath95 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume the spectrum of the form @xmath96 .",
    "next , we can introduce the five - dimensional field @xmath97 , with @xmath84 fulfilling the auxiliary sturm - liouville problem in the variable @xmath98 , @xmath99 + q(z ) \\psi_n(z ) = m_n^2 \\rho(z ) \\psi_n(z ) ,   \\label{eq : sl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions are orthogonal with respect to the weight function @xmath100 , provided suitable boundary conditions @xmath101 and @xmath102 are fulfilled .",
    "the action can then be written as @xmath103 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after some integration by parts in the variable @xmath104 .",
    "this action can be written as a five - dimensional action with a non - trivial metric  @xcite , featuring the ads / cft ( soft - wall ) approach ( see @xcite and references therein ) , with the extra dimension @xmath104 playing the role of a holographic variable and the orthogonal set of functions @xmath84 denoting the corresponding kaluza - klein modes .",
    "clearly , @xmath104 has the dimension of length , suggesting that @xmath105 corresponds to the ultraviolet and @xmath106 to the infrared regime .",
    "turning to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sl ] ) , we may take the standard harmonic oscillator schrdinger - like equation ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) @xmath109 and obtain for the regular solutions at infinity the result @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the euler gamma function , which is meromorphic and have simple poles at @xmath112 .",
    "the solutions fulfilling the dirichlet , @xmath113 , and neumann , @xmath114 , boundary conditions , respectively , have the masses @xmath115 which can be merged into one single formula @xmath116 this yields @xmath117 and , for the string tension , @xmath118 with @xmath119 , quite reasonable values .    in this approach",
    "the symmetry in the scalar spectrum corresponds to a parity symmetry in the holographic @xmath104 variable @xmath120 .",
    "note that usually the holographic variable @xmath104 is taken to be positive and @xmath121 , with @xmath122 denoting the impact parameter and @xmath123 the momentum fraction of the quark .",
    "this interpretation yields a two dimensional potential @xmath124 with @xmath125 which , when passing to the polar variable @xmath104 , generates the usual centrifugal term @xmath126 not present in our discussion , yielding @xmath127 which for @xmath128 and @xmath129 resembles eq .",
    "( [ eq : all_mass ] ) . ] , but if we extend it to @xmath130 , we may define a holographic superfield containing two different and orthogonal modes .",
    "otherwise , in the interval @xmath131 the dirichlet and neumann modes are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "discerning the nature of the @xmath19 state has been a recurrent pastime for many years .",
    "as is well known , glueballs are more weakly coupled to mesons , @xmath132 , than other mesons , @xmath133 .",
    "the minimum number of states , allowed by certain sum rules and low energy theorems , is just two . in ref .",
    "@xcite we undertake such an analysis which suggests that @xmath2 ( denoted as @xmath19 ) is a @xmath61 meson , while @xmath134 ( denoted as @xmath135 is a glueball .",
    "this is supported by the rather small width ratio , which yields @xmath136 , thus for @xmath137 the ratio @xmath138 is obtained .    a further piece of evidence for the alternating meson - glueball pattern is provided by looking at the excited pion spectrum , which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : regge - trajectory ] .",
    "the alternating pattern was unveiled by glozman  @xcite , suggesting that states degenerate with the pion might not be identified with glueballs . remarkably , the states generating doublets with pion states are @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 , whereas the other scalar states @xmath134 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 are not degenerate with other mesons with light @xmath147 and @xmath148 quarks .",
    "our analysis is reinforced by this observation .    as a matter of fact , fitting the pion @xmath149 as the @xmath150 state of the regge spectrum requires strong departure from a simple linear trajectory , @xmath151 .",
    "one may improve on this by using the holographic connection and a mixed boundary condition at @xmath152 determined by fixing the mass of the ground state @xmath153 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc - self ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc - log ] ) for the harmonic oscillator case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ho ] ) .",
    "this procedure ensures the orthogonality between all states and implements linearity for large @xmath73 .",
    "this can be done for the ground states @xmath154 .",
    "the fit to all states yields @xmath155 and the mass spectra ( in gev ) @xmath156 yielding @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 , respectively . note the large and small values for the @xmath19 and @xmath160 cases , which suggests that these boundary conditions are very close to the dirichlet and neumann cases .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking corresponds to the different @xmath161 and @xmath19 values .",
    "hadronic matrix elements of the energy - momentum tensor , the so - called gravitational form factors ( gff ) of the pion and nucleon , correspond to a dominance of scalar states in the large-@xmath1 picture , as ( @xmath162 is a dirac spinor ) @xmath163 where the sum rules @xmath164  @xcite and @xmath165  @xcite hold .",
    "unfortunately , the lattice qcd data for the pion  @xcite and nucleon ( lhpc  @xcite and qcdsf  @xcite collaborations ) , picking the valence quark contribution , are too noisy as to pin down the coupling of the excited scalar - isoscalar states to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "nevertheless , useful information confirming the ( regge ) mass estimates for the @xmath19-meson can be extracted  @xcite through the use of the multiplicative qcd evolution of the gff in the valence quark momentum fraction , @xmath166 , as seen in deep inelastic scattering or on the lattice at the scale @xmath167 . for the pion and nucleon gffs",
