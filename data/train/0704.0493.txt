    "a crumpling of surfaces has been investigated on the basis of the singularity analysis , and progress has been recently made on understanding the crumpling phenomena ; the universal structure on the crumpled thin sheets was found in the formations of singularity of ridges and cones @xcite . a similar transition to this phenomena",
    "was also found experimentally between the smooth state and the crumpled state in an artificial membrane , which is partly polymerized @xcite .",
    "studies have also been focused on the transition in the surface model of helfrich , polyakov and kleinert ( hpk ) @xcite from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the bending rigidity is known to be stiffened by the thermal fluctuation of the surface , and this was confirmed in the statistical mechanics of membranes @xcite .",
    "numerical studies were made to understand the transition in triangulated surface models @xcite .",
    "the transition was reported as first - order in recent numerical studies @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the concern with inhomogeneous surfaces has been growing over the past decade @xcite . a homogeneous artificial membrane that is coated by elastic skeletons is also considered to be an inhomogeneous membrane .",
    "some of the mechanical properties of such membranes were revealed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the hop diffusion of membrane protein or lipids was observed , and as a consequence the compartment of cytoskeletons was confirmed to be in biological membranes @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that the microtubule , which is an element of the cytoskeleton , gives a mechanical strength to the surface of the biological membranes",
    ".    however , the surface collapsing phenomena and the surface fluctuation phenomena are almost unknown in such inhomogeneous models for membranes .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to study an inhomogeneous fluid surface model within the framework of the conventional surface model of hpk .",
    "we note that the inhomogeneity in our model corresponds to the cytoskeletons in biological membranes as stated above .",
    "the fluidity realized by dynamical triangulations in the inhomogeneous model , as well as the fluidity in the homogeneous surface models , corresponds to the lateral diffusion of lipids in membranes .    in this paper",
    "we study a compartmentalized surface model by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model includes no two - dimensional bending energy but a one - dimensional bending energy .",
    "the model is defined on dynamically triangulated surfaces , where the free diffusion of vertices is confined inside the compartments .",
    "the mechanical strength of the surface is given only by the compartment boundary , which is composed of one - dimensional elastic chains and rigid junctions . because the collapsed phase is expected to appear at sufficiently small bending rigidity @xmath0\\!\\to\\ ! 0 ( b\\!\\not=\\!0)$ ] , we concentrate on the phase structure at relatively large @xmath1 in this paper .",
    "consequently , information on the phase boundary at @xmath2 remains unanswered .",
    "we recently reported numerical results of three types of surface models @xcite , which are similar to the model in this paper .",
    "then , we should comment on the similarity / difference between the model in this paper and the models in @xcite .",
    "firstly , the lattice structure of the model in this paper is very similar to that of the first model in @xcite and that of the model in @xcite , and is identical to that of the second model in @xcite .",
    "secondly , the lattice in this paper and that of the first model in @xcite are the dynamically triangulated one , while the lattice of the second model in @xcite and that in @xcite are the fixed - connectivity one .",
    "thirdly , the hamiltonian is different from the one in the first model in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model of this paper includes only one - dimensional bending energy , which is defined on the compartment boundary , while the hamiltonian of the first in @xcite includes only a two - dimensional bending energy , which is defined all over the surface , and no one - dimensional bending energy is given to the compartment boundary .",
    "therefore , the model in this paper is different from the three models in @xcite .",
    "our results obtained in this paper show that the model undergoes a first - order transition between the smooth phase and the crumpled phase .",
    "moreover , the smooth phase can be divided into the spherical phase and the planar phase , and the crumpled phase can also be divided into the tubular phase and the collapsed phase , which is expected to appear at sufficiently small @xmath1 because no self - avoiding property @xcite is assumed in the model . it must be emphasized that such variety of phases can be seen neither in the conventional surface models nor in the compartmentalized models such as those in @xcite .",
    "one remarkable result is the appearance of planar surfaces .",
    "the echinocytic shapes of erythrocytes were extensively studied , and they are currently known to be described by many models such as the area difference bilayer model @xcite .",
    "the shape of membranes is also sensitive to the flow fields @xcite .",
    "our model in this paper indicates that one possible origin of such planar shape comes from the inhomogeneity due to the cytoskeltal structure and the fluidity of lateral diffusion of vertices .",

    "in fact , the surface fluctuation mainly comes from the thermal fluctuation of vertices inside the compartments .",
    "because no bending energy is assumed inside the compartments , the fluctuation of vertices becomes large not only in the in - plane directions ( free diffusion ) but also in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",

    "the surface size is @xmath126 , which is identical to that in fig.[fig-2 ] .",
    "the snapshot in fig.[fig-8](b ) at @xmath132 is the final configuration produced after @xmath150 mcs including @xmath116 thermalizaion mcs ; the planar surface was stable throughout the simulation .",
    "thus , we find that three distinct phases are seen also in the surfaces of @xmath52 , and that the planar phase is unstable on the surfaces of @xmath48 and @xmath56 under the condition @xmath75",
    ". therefore , we consider that the phase structure of the model is independent of whether @xmath74 or @xmath75 .     against @xmath1 obtained on the surface of ( a )",

    "a jump of @xmath130 in fig.[fig-9](b ) at the transition point between the planar phase and the spherical phase is very small , and hence is hardly seen just the same as in fig.[fig-3](b ) under @xmath74 in the previous subsection .",
    "thus , we find no difference between @xmath130 of @xmath75 and that of @xmath74 .     against @xmath1 obtained on the surfaces of ( a ) @xmath48 , ( b ) @xmath52 , and ( c ) @xmath56.,width=321 ]    the mean square size @xmath143 are shown in figs.[fig-10](a)[fig-10](c ) .",
    "a jump is also seen in @xmath143 on the @xmath52 and @xmath56 surfaces in figs.[fig-10](b ) and [ fig-10](c ) , and it is hardly seen on the @xmath48 surfaces of size up to @xmath151 . these results are identical to those observed in figs.[fig-7](a)[fig-7](c ) under @xmath74 .",
    "finally , we comment on the planar phase appeared only on the @xmath52 surface .",
    "the thermal fluctuation of vertices inside the compartments disorders the surface against the bending energy of the compartment boundary .",
    "therefore , the strength to disorder the surface increases ( decreases ) with increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath11 if @xmath8 remains fixed , as stated in section [ model ] . on the other hand , the mechanical strength of the surface increases ( decreases ) with decreasing ( increasing ) @xmath11 , because the total number of junctions increases ( decreases ) with decreasing ( increasing ) @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the strength to order the surface increases ( decreases ) with decreasing ( increasing ) @xmath11 .",
    "then , we expect that the surface is ordered ( disordered ) at sufficiently small ( large ) @xmath11 at given intermediate value of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , it seems possible that two competitive forces to order / disorder the surface are balanced with each other at intermediate values of @xmath11 and consequently , some new phase appears depending on @xmath1 at those @xmath11 .",
    "note also that the possibility of the appearance of planar phase is not completely eliminated on the surfaces of @xmath48 and @xmath56 of sufficiently large size .",
    "we have shown that a dynamically triangulated spherical surface has three distinct phases ; the tubular phase , the planar phase , and the spherical phase , and that they are separated by discontinuous transitions .",
    "the first - order nature was very clear from the discontinuity in the bending energies @xmath6 and @xmath135 not only at the transition point between the tubular phase and the planar phase but also at the transition point between the tubular phase and the spherical phase . we know that the model has the collapsed phase at sufficiently small @xmath1 , since the self - avoiding property is not assumed at least .",
    "therefore , we expect that the model has four different phases including the collapsed phase , although the order of the transition between the collapsed phase and the tubular phase is unknown .",
    "the mechanical strength of the surface is given only by elastic linear - chains with rigid junctions .",
    "the triangulated surfaces are characterized by the size @xmath152 , where @xmath8 is the total number of vertices including the junctions , @xmath9 is the total number of vertices on the chains , @xmath10 is the total number of junctions , and @xmath11 is the length of chains between the two nearest - neighbor junctions on the starting configurations .",
    "these four parameters are not totally independent , because these are given by two independent integers @xmath153 , where @xmath14 divides @xmath12 . in fact , @xmath31 , @xmath22 , @xmath18 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we assumed three different values for @xmath11 such that @xmath48 , @xmath52 , and @xmath56 in the simulations .",
    "the edge length @xmath85 of the rigid junction was fixed to be @xmath87 .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 , which represents a weight for the three - dimensional integrations of the partition function , was assumed as @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "it is remarkable that the model has the planar phase , which is stable only on the surfaces with a specific structure .",
    "in fact , the planar phase can be seen on the surfaces of @xmath52 , and it is unstable on the @xmath48 and @xmath56 surfaces .",
    "the planar phase appears in a narrow region on the @xmath1-axis between the tubular phase and the spherical phase , and it is distinguishable from the spherical phase because a small but finite discontinuity can be seen in the bending energies @xmath130 and @xmath139 .",
    "the gap of the bending energy @xmath6 at the transition point is very small , i.e. , @xmath6 in the planar phase is almost identical to that in the spherical phase ; however , the double peak structure was clearly seen in the histogram of @xmath6 , which is included in the hamiltonian . from this",
    ", we confirmed that the transition between the planar phase and the spherical phase is of first order .",
    "our model in this paper indicates that one possible origin of planar shape of spherical membranes comes from the inhomogeneity due to the cytoskeltal structure and the fluidity of lateral diffusion of vertices .",
    "we have confirmed that the results obtained at @xmath74 in eq.([measure ] ) remain unchanged when @xmath75 .",
    "the phase structure of the fluid surface model in this paper is independent of the choice of @xmath73 at least for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "large scale simulations should be performed .",
    "it remains to be studied how large @xmath44 are sufficient for the thermodynamic limit of the model .",
