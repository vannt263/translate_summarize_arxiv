    "in the last years , advances in single - molecule spectroscopy @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr)@xcite made it possible to detect and investigate higher - energy , excited - state conformations of folded proteins .",
    "the higher - energy conformations are in dynamic , thermally activated exchange with lowest - energy , ground - state conformations that correspond to the structures determined by x - ray crystallography or standard nmr methods .",
    "structural investigations of such higher - energy conformations revealed that the thermally activated conformational changes are comparable to the conformational changes observed during the binding or unbinding of ligands or during chemical reactions catalyzed by the proteins @xcite , which demonstrated that these functional conformational changes can occur in the absence of ligand or substrate molecules , or with bound ligands .    a theoretical basis for the conformational dynamics of proteins in the folded",
    ", native state is provided by energy - landscape perspectives , which have been first developed for protein folding @xcite .",
    "key concepts are the _ population shift _ of protein conformations during binding or chemical reactions , and _ conformational selection _ , i.e.  the view that pre - existing , higher - energy conformations of proteins can be ` selected ' by ligands for binding @xcite .",
    "central aspects of these concepts already emerged in early models of protein allostery @xcite .",
    "in general , both conformational changes and binding / unbinding events are thermally activated process that require the crossing of free - energy barriers .",
    "a characteristic feature of thermally activated processes is that the actual time for crossing the free - energy barrier , the ` transition time ' , is significantly smaller than the dwell times in the states before and after the barrier crossing . in single - molecule experiments that probe conformational changes of proteins , the transition times are typically beyond experimental resolution , and the conformational changes appear as ` sudden jumps ' between two or more conformational states @xcite .",
    "similarly , thermally activated binding and unbinding events have typical transition times that are significantly smaller than the dwell times in the bound and unbound state .",
    "the transition time for binding is the time for crossing the energy barrier into the binding site from a position in direct proximity of the binding site .",
    "this binding transition time is independent of the molecular concentrations , in contrast to the dwell times in the unbound state , which are related to the binding rate .",
    "let us consider now a protein @xmath0 with two dominant conformations 1 and 2 that can both bind to a ligand @xmath1 .",
    "if this ligand is a small molecule , it seems reasonable to assume that the transition times for binding and unbinding are small compared to the dwell times in the conformational states of the protein with typical durations of submilliseconds to seconds .",
    "a direct consequence is that the binding and unbinding events of the ligand then are decoupled from the conformational transitions , because these binding and unbinding events occur during the dwell time the protein spends in either conformation 1 or conformation 2 .",
    "this decoupling leads to a temporal ordering of binding / unbinding events and conformational changes : the binding event occurs either before or after the conformational change ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "conformational changes and binding or catalytic events of larger ligands , in contrast , can be intricately coupled @xcite .",
    "the binding - induced folding of peptides , for example , involves a coupling between the binding and the conformational change of the peptides from unfolded to folded without clear temporal ordering of binding events and conformational transitions @xcite . as another example , the proline cis - trans - isomerization of peptide substrates that is catalyzed by the enzyme cyclophilin a exhibits a close coupling between the conformational change of the enzyme and the conformational isomerization of the peptide during the catalysis @xcite .",
    "along the lower pathway of fig .  1 from the unbound ground state @xmath2 to the bound ground state @xmath3 , the conformational change occurs _ prior to _ the binding of the ligand .",
    "this binding mechanism has been termed ` conformational selection ' @xcite , because the ligand appears to select conformation @xmath4 for binding .",
    "the conformational change along this pathway is a thermally activated transition from the unbound ground - state conformation @xmath2 to the excited - state conformation @xmath4 . along the upper pathway of fig .",
    "1 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , the conformational change of the protein occurs _",
    "after _ the binding of the ligand to the unbound ground - state conformation @xmath2 .",
    "this alternative binding mechanism has been termed ` induced fit ' @xcite because the conformational change along this pathway is apparently induced by the binding of the ligand .",
    "the conformational change along this pathway is a relaxation process from the bound excited state @xmath5 into the bound ground state @xmath3 .",
    "conformational selection and induced fit thus can be identified by the _ temporal ordering _ of the ` chemical ' binding step and the ` physical ' conformational change along the pathway . for induced - fit binding",
    ", the conformational change occurs after the binding step . for conformational - selection binding",
    ", the conformational change occurs prior to the binding step .    in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the flux along the binding direction of each of the two pathways , i.e.  the number of binding events per unit time , is equal to the opposite flux in unbinding direction , because the principle of detailed balance prohibits any flux cycles in equilibrium .",
    "fluxes along a cycle only exist in the presence of a non - equilibrium driving force .",
    "for example , non - equilibrium concentrations of substrate and product molecules drive the flux along the catalytic cycle of an enzyme @xcite .",
    "let us assume now that one of the two pathways of fig .  1 is dominant , and that the flux along the other pathway is negligible .",
    "a direct consequence of the detailed - balance principle then is that the same pathway dominates in the reverse direction .",
    "this implies that the ordering of the ` chemical ' and ` physical ' substeps is reversed in the unbinding direction , compared to binding . in the reverse direction of the induced - fit binding pathway , the ` physical ' conformational change from the bound ground state @xmath3 to",
    "the bound excited state @xmath5 occurs _",
    "prior to _ the ` chemical ' unbinding step of the ligand .",
    "the reverse of induced - fit binding thus is unbinding _ via _ conformational selection , because the ligand ` selectively ' unbinds from the excited - state conformation @xmath5 , after the conformational change ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) . in the reverse direction of the conformational - selection binding pathway ,",
    "the conformational relaxation from the unbound excited state @xmath4 into the unbound ground state @xmath2 occurs after the unbinding step .",
    "this conformational relaxation is ` induced ' by the unbinding of the ligand ( see fig .",
    "2(b ) ) .",
    "conformational selection and induced conformational changes thus can be seen as two sides of the some coin : a conformational - selection mechanism turns into an induced - change mechanism when the overall direction of binding or unbinding is reversed . in this view",
    ", conformational selection is identified by a conformational change that occurs _ prior to _ a chemical step , which may be binding , unbinding , or also a catalytic step .",
    "this conformational change is a conformational excitation from a lowest - energy , ground - state conformation to a higher - energy conformation",
    ". induced conformational changes , in contrast , are identified by a conformational change that occurs _",
    "after _ a chemical step",
    ". these induced conformational changes are conformational relaxations from an excited - state to a ground - state conformation . the notion of ` induced change ' here",
    "generalizes the notion of ` induced fit ' to unbinding events and catalytic steps , i.e.  to chemical steps beyond binding .",
    "the temporal ordering of physical and chemical steps also helps to identify conformational selection and induced - change processes along more complex pathways such as the pathway shown in fig .  3 along which a ligand binds to a protein confirmation that is different both from the unbound ground - state and the bound ground - state conformation .",
    "binding processes are often investigated in _ relaxation experiments _ @xcite .",
    "in such experiments , two solutions that contain , e.g. , either proteins or ligands are initially mixed , and the relaxation into the binding equilibrium is reflected in a time - dependent fluorescence intensity of the mixed solutions .",
    "the experiments rely on a change of fluorescence intensity of the ligand or protein upon binding .",
    "the relaxation process is typically described as a single - exponential or multi - exponential process .",
    "the characteristic rate of a single - exponential process and the dominant , slowest rate of a multi - exponential are termed @xmath6 . for a multi - exponential process",
