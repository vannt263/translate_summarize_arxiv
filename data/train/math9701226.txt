    "we consider two - dimensional first passage percolation , where each pair of nearest neighbours of @xmath0 have an edge connecting them and each edge is equipped with a nonnegative random variable which is interpreted as the time it takes to traverse the edge ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "we specialize to the case where these passage times are i.i.d.exponentials ; this is the so called richardson model @xcite . by time",
    "scaling , we may assume without loss of genertality that the exponential distribution has mean one .",
    "for @xmath6 , let @xmath7 be the time taken to reach @xmath8 from @xmath9 , i.e.  @xmath7 is the infimum over all paths from @xmath9 to @xmath8 of the sum of the passage times along the path .",
    "write @xmath10 for the origin and let , for @xmath11 , @xmath12 so that @xmath13 is the set of sites reached from the origin by time @xmath14 .",
    "it follows from the memoryless property of the exponential distribution that @xmath13 is a markov process , and the following interacting particle system formulation is natural .",
    "each site @xmath9 takes the value @xmath15 at time @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath16 and write @xmath17 for the whole configuration of 0 s and 1 s at time @xmath14 .",
    "we may think of sites in state 0 as healthy and those in state 1 as infected .",
    "each site in state 1 remains in this state forever and tries to infect each of its four nearest neighbours at rate one , so that a site in state 0 flips to state 1 at rate equal to the number of nearest neighbours with state 1 . at time 0 , only the origin is infected .",
    "one of the most important results in first passage percolation is the existence of the so called time constant @xmath18 such that @xmath19 which is a consequence of kingman s subadditive ergodic theorem .",
    "this result in fact holds under much more general conditions than those considered in this paper .",
    "the precise value of @xmath18 is not known , although some bounds are available .",
    "we will need a lower bound on @xmath18 , and the best such bound we are aware of is @xmath20 as shown in @xcite .",
    "similar time constants exist for all directions . moreover , there is the following asymptotic shape result which , somewhat loosely speaking , states that analogues of ( [ kingman ] ) hold for all directions simultaneously : let @xmath21 ^ 2 , z\\in b(t ) \\mbox { such that } y+z = x\\},\\ ] ] i.e.  @xmath22 is a `` fattened '' version of @xmath13 . then there exists a nonrandom compact convex set @xmath23 such that for all @xmath24 @xmath25 see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we will be interested in a different aspect of the evolution of infection , namely the * tree of infection * , to be denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the graph with vertex set @xmath13 and edge set obtained as follows . for each @xmath28 ,",
    "let @xmath29 be the edge connecting @xmath9 to the vertex @xmath8 from which @xmath9 got infected , and let @xmath30 be the edge set of @xmath27 .",
    "each vertex of @xmath27 gets a unique path to @xmath10 , so @xmath27 is indeed a tree .",
    "moreover , both the vertex set and the edge set of @xmath27 are increasing in @xmath14 , so the limiting object @xmath31 also exists .",
    "the tree structure of @xmath27 is inherited by @xmath26 .",
    "equivalently , we may define @xmath26 as the graph with vertex set @xmath0 and edge set given by @xmath32 our main interest is in the number of topological ends of @xmath26 , i.e.  how many infinite self - avoiding paths starting at @xmath10 does @xmath26 contain ?",
    "let @xmath33 denote the number of such paths . by a standard compactness argument , @xmath34 .",
    "newman @xcite has shown that @xmath35 a.s .",
    "provided a certain hypothesis concerning uniformly bounded curvature of @xmath23 .",
    "( see also @xcite for related results . )",
    "the uniformly bounded curvature hypothesis is highly plausible , but has so far not been not proved .",
    "we shall prove the following result which is a small step towards the conjecture that @xmath35 a.s .",
    "* theorem 1.1 : * _ the number of topological ends @xmath33 of the tree of infection satisfies @xmath36 _    in order to prove this result , we shall first study a simple and natural model for competing spatial growth",
    ". we will now go on to describe this model , which is a variant of the richardson model and which we propose to call the * two - type richardson model*.    consider an interacting particle system on @xmath0 with state space @xmath2 , where 0 s may be thought of as healthy sites , and 1 s and 2 s as two different types of infection .",
    "the evolution is as follows .",
    "a site in state 1 stays in this state forever , and the same thing holds for a site in state 2 .",
    "both types of infected sites try to infect each of their nearest neighbours at rate one , so that a site in state 0 flips to state 1 at rate equal to the number of nearest neighbours in state 1 , and to state 2 at rate equal to the number of nearest neighbours in state 2 .",
    "we will write @xmath37 for the configuration at time @xmath14 ; @xmath37 will be an element of @xmath38 .",
    "note that if we disregard the type of infection ( i.e.  if we watch this system evolve wearing a pair of glasses which prevents us from distinguishing between 1 s and 2 s ) , then the system behaves exactly as the ordinary ( one - type ) richardson model .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the fact that the total flip rate of a site in state 0 equals its total number of infected nearest neighbours .",
    "we start at time 0 with an infection of type 1 at * 0 * and an infection of type 2 at another site @xmath9 , all other sites being healthy .",
    "the model can then be described in first passage percolation terms : a site @xmath8 is infected at time @xmath39 , which we define as the infimum , over all paths starting at @xmath10 or @xmath9 and ending at @xmath8 , of the sum of the passage times along the path .",
    "since the distribution of the passage times of the edges is continuous , it is not hard to see that the infimum is in fact a.s .",
    "a minimum which is attained for a unique path .",
    "if this fastest path starts at @xmath10 , then @xmath8 gets infection of type 1 , otherwise it gets type 2 .",
    "we may think of the two - type richardson model as a crude model for two growing bacteria colonies ( or two political empires ) competing for space .",
    "it may happen that at some early stage , one of the types of infection completely surrounds the other type which then is prevented from growing indefinitely .",
    "write @xmath40 for the event that this does not happen , in which case both types of infection will grow indefinitely .",
    "the first question one would like to answer about the two - type richardson model is whether or not @xmath41 ( it is obvious that @xmath42 ) .",
    "the answer to this question is in fact independent of @xmath9 , as stated in the following proposition , where we write @xmath43 for the probability of @xmath40 with the described starting configuration . the proof will be given in section 2 .",
    "* proposition 1.2 : * _ for any @xmath44 , @xmath45 _",
    "hence we may restrict attention to @xmath46 , i.e.to the two - type richardson model starting with a 1 at the origin , a 2 right next to the origin , and all other sites healthy .",
    "our main result on the two - type richardson model now says    * theorem 1.3 : * @xmath47    so that with positive probability both bacteria colonies keep growing forever . inserting ( [ janson ] )",
    "yields @xmath48 .",
    "let us now go back to the one - type richardson model and the question of the number @xmath33 of topological ends of the tree of infection . start with a single infected site at @xmath10 and suppose that the first site that @xmath10 infects is @xmath49 .",
    "it is then an immediate consequence of theorem 1.3 and the identification between the one - type richardson model and the two - type richardson model with types disregarded , that there is positive probability for the event that @xmath26 has two different self - avoiding paths to infinity : one which goes through @xmath49 and one which does not .",
    "hence * theorem 1.3 implies theorem 1.1*.    similarly , if it had turned out that infinite growth of both bacteria colonies had probability zero , then we would have been able to conclude that @xmath50 a.s .",
    "this remark is of course an empty statement , but we point it out anyway because it is feasible that a similar implication might be useful in some of the possible extensions of the model considered here ; see below .    in order to prove theorem 1.3",
    ", we will need the following proposition , which will be proved in section 2 .",
    "we think it is of some interest in its own , and it also seems related to questions concerning the roughness of the boundary of @xmath13 , studied e.g.  in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "* proposition 1.4 : * _ for any @xmath24 , there exist infinitely many @xmath51 in the right half - plane , such that @xmath52 >   { \\textstyle \\frac{2\\mu+1}{3 } } - \\varepsilon,\\ ] ] which is greater than @xmath53 when @xmath54 is small .",
    "in fact , the stronger result holds that for some @xmath55 @xmath56 > { \\textstyle \\frac{2\\mu+1}{3}}-\\varepsilon.\\ ] ] _    inserting ( [ janson ] ) gives that the right hand sides in ( [ preprop ] ) and ( [ prop ] ) can be made greater that @xmath57 .",
    "intuitively , proposition 1.4 says that there are sites in @xmath0 arbitrarily far away from the origin which `` strongly feel '' from which direction the infection is coming .",
    "it seems reasonable to believe that the @xmath58 in ( [ prop ] ) in fact is a limit , and independent of @xmath59 .",
    "apart from proving the conjecture about @xmath26 a.s .  having infinitely many topological ends , there are various other ways in which one might want to extend and improve the results of this paper . an obvious question is what happens when @xmath0 is replaced by @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "another direction is to allow passage time distributions other than the exponential .",
    "the markovian behaviour of @xmath13 is then lost whence the interacting particle system formulation becomes less natural , but the questions about @xmath26 remain just as natural as for the exponential case .",
    "an inspection of the proof of proposition 1.4 shows that the result @xmath62 extends to the case where the passage times of the edges have a continuous distribution with a hazard rate which is bounded between two constants @xmath63 satisfying @xmath64 , ( here @xmath18 still denotes the time constant when the passage time distribution is a mean one exponential ) .",
    "one can also ask what happens if we extend the two - type richardson model to having three or more different types , in the obvious way . for this extension , showing that @xmath65 different types simultaneously can grow indefinitely from a finite starting configuration is equivalent to showing that @xmath66 .",
    "yet another direction of generalization would be to allow the two types to have different infection rates @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and for this extension we conjecture that @xmath69 whenever @xmath70 .",
    "since theorem 1.3 implies theorem 1.1 , it only remains to prove propositions 1.2 and 1.4 , and theorem 1.3 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to this task .",
    "the hard work is in the proof of proposition 1.4 .",
    "* proof of proposition 1.2 : * suppose @xmath71 , and let @xmath72 be the circle of radius @xmath73 ( here @xmath74 is the euclidean norm ) centered at @xmath10 . by conditioning on the first @xmath75 infections ( for some @xmath75 which we need not define explicitly here ) we can find @xmath76 and a configuration @xmath77 such that @xmath78 restricted to @xmath79 contains only 1 s and 2 s , and such that @xmath80 . note that @xmath81 and @xmath82 both must be connected sets ( in the graph - theoretic sense with edges between all nearest neighbours ) .",
    "let @xmath83 be the set the set of infected sites in @xmath78 ; by choice of @xmath84 also @xmath85 is connected .",
    "define @xmath86 i.e.  @xmath87 is the set of infected sites with at least one healthy neighbour .",
    "it is easy to check , using the strong markov property , that @xmath88 does not depend on the values of @xmath78 on @xmath89 . by choice of @xmath84",
    ", we may now construct a configuration @xmath90 such that              * proof of proposition 1.4 : * our aim is to show that ( [ prop ] ) holds for fixed @xmath24 and some @xmath59 .",
    "we will consider the evolution of @xmath13 inside the half - strip @xmath102 for some large @xmath65 ( taking @xmath103 will suffice ) .",
    "writing @xmath104 for the number of infected sites in @xmath105 at time @xmath14 , we have , as an easy consequence of ( [ kingman ] ) , that @xmath106 for @xmath1 , write @xmath107 for the flip rate of @xmath9 at time @xmath14 , and write @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "it follows from ( [ lim4 ] ) and an application of the strong law of large numbers that @xmath110 now write @xmath111 ( @xmath112 as in good ) for the number of infected sites in @xmath105 at time @xmath14 which became infected after their nearest neighbour to the left , and write @xmath113 ( @xmath114 for bad ) for the corresponding number of sites which became infected after their nearest neighbour to the right . by keeping track of the left - right nearest neighbour pairs",
    ", we have , as for ( [ lim4 ] ) , @xmath115 although note that @xmath116 holds only approximately because an individual site may sometimes be infected after neither or both of its left - right nearest neighbours .",
    "write @xmath117 for @xmath118 where this time the sum is taken over uninfected sites in @xmath105 whose nearest neighbour to the left is already infected at time @xmath14 , and define @xmath119 analogously .",

    "we now look at a configuration @xmath125 , which will serve as an example of what @xmath126 may look like at some reasonably large time point @xmath14 . since @xmath127 for @xmath128 and all sufficiently large @xmath14 a.s .",
