    "molecular systems possess a variety of properties that open the possibility to use them for high - precision measurements .",
    "the richness of their electronic , vibrational , and rotational spectra provides a series of precision benchmarks from the radio frequencies to the visible spectrum .",
    "one of the earliest applications of molecules in spectroscopy involved high accuracy frequency standards .",
    "the first molecular clock based on microwave transitions in ammonia was built in 1949 @xcite .",
    "other molecular frequency standards provided secondary , relative frequency references to enhance measurement precision @xcite , and played an important role in measurements of fundamental constants such as the speed of light @xcite and possibly the proton to electron mass ratio @xcite .",
    "furthermore , molecules are valuable for tests of fundamental physics .",
    "diatomic molecules have been proposed for use in parity violation studies @xcite due to the enhanced sensitivity of rovibrational spectra to nuclear effects , as well as in measurements of the electron electric dipole moment @xcite that can benefit from very large internal electric fields of polar molecules .",
    "recent developments in precision measurement techniques , as well as in cooling and trapping , have stimulated an interest in the application of molecular spectroscopy to studies of possible time variation of fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "in particular , research has focused on the variation of the fine structure constant @xmath1 @xcite and the proton to electron mass ratio @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the values of these constants can drift monotonically , or vary periodically with the distance from the earth to the sun in case of the existence of gravitational coupling . while state - of - the art optical atomic clocks have set the most stringent limits on both types of @xmath1 variations @xcite , atoms generally lack transitions that can reveal relative @xmath3 variations ( @xmath4 ) in a model - independent way . on the other hand ,",
    "molecules exhibit complex structure and dynamics due to the combination of their electronic interaction and the vibrations and rotations of their constituent nuclei . for example , if @xmath5 drifts relative to @xmath6 , the effect on the weakly bound vibrational levels near dissociation is expected to be much smaller than on the more deeply bound levels at intermediate nuclear distances ( e.g. see fig .",
    "2 ( b ) in ref .",
    "this can allow accurate spectroscopic determinations of @xmath4 by using the least sensitive levels as frequency anchors .",
    "moreover , two - color optical raman spectroscopy of vibrational energy spacings within a single electronic potential takes advantage of the entire molecular potential depth in order to minimize the relative measurement error .    for a given spectral line at frequency @xmath7 , the systematic line shift @xmath8 results from @xmath9 through the proportionality constant @xmath10 , @xmath11 for direct spectroscopy of molecular vibrational energy levels , @xmath12 . to minimize the fractional uncertainty @xmath13 on the measurement of @xmath14",
    ", we must minimize @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the measurement uncertainty of the absolute frequency @xmath7 . since in precision spectroscopy experiments",
    "the limitations are typically on @xmath16 rather than the relative uncertainty @xmath17 , and since @xmath18 the quantity @xmath19 must be maximized .",
    "this implies that the optimal frequency intervals for the @xmath3-variation - sensitive molecular clock are those with the largest absolute frequency shifts ( @xmath8 ) due to a given fractional change @xmath4 ( for sr@xmath0 , this is approximately 270 @xmath20 for a unity change in the mass ratio ) . in some proposed schemes",
    "@xcite , near - degeneracies of vibrational levels from different electronic potentials permit a frequency measurement of @xmath7 to be carried out in the microwave domain , resulting in a small @xmath16 .",
    "the effective @xmath10 is small , and thus the corresponding quantity @xmath21 is reasonably large . in the proposed optical raman measurement @xcite ,",
    "however , the sensitivity enhancement comes from the cumulative shift effect over the depth of the molecular potential .",
    "while @xmath10 is on the order of unity here , @xmath7 is large , resulting in a large @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , if the least sensitive energy gap is measured concurrently with the most sensitive one , it can serve as a reference and thus remove any frequency drift of an intermediate ( atomic ) clock used in the measurement .",
    "thus , in our previous work @xcite we have proposed measuring the intervals between the sr@xmath0 x@xmath22 ( see fig . [ schema ] ) vibrational levels @xmath23 ( in the middle of the potential well ) and @xmath24 ( near dissociation , counting from the top ) , as well as between @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "these are complementary schemes , with opposite dependences on @xmath4 .",
    "the difference between these two frequency intervals , normalized by their sum , doubles the sensitivity of the measurement , while eliminating any drift of an intermediate frequency reference used to stabilize the raman lasers .",
    "finally , all - optical molecular spectroscopy in the tight confinement ( lamb - dicke ) regime in an optical lattice can be doppler and recoil free , leading to small frequency uncertainties @xmath16 .",
    "ultracold homonuclear molecules in optical lattices are particularly good candidates for high precision measurements such as those of @xmath4 .",
    "their vibrational levels have long natural lifetimes that are insensitive to black body radiation , and the molecules do not experience long - range interactions when isolated in optical lattice sites .",
    "in particular , sr@xmath0 dimers are promising for precise molecular metrology @xcite .",
    "sr atoms can be directly laser cooled to temperatures of @xmath26 @xmath3k @xcite , and can be trapped in stark - cancellation optical lattices that eliminate spectral shifts and broadening @xcite .",
    "optical atomic clocks based on forbidden electronic transitions in @xmath27sr have shown that systematic frequency uncertainties can be reduced to the @xmath28 level @xcite in the lamb - dicke regime of a stark - cancellation lattice . moreover ,",
    "work on @xmath29sr narrow line @xmath30 photoassociation @xcite has shown high experimental efficiency and resolution , and a potential for excellent agreement with theoretical calculations .",
    "the comparisons between experiments and theory are largely facilitated by the spinless nature of the @xmath29sr ground state ( @xmath31 , total electronic angular momentum @xmath32 , nuclear spin @xmath33 ) .",
    "the electronic ground state of sr@xmath0 thus corresponds to a single molecular potential ( x@xmath22 in fig .",
    "[ schema ] ) with non - degenerate vibrational levels with the exception of rotational duplicity .",
    "this simple ground state potential should allow highly efficient spectroscopic addressing of molecular vibrational levels .",
    "finally , the laser - accessible metastable molecular potentials ( corresponding to the @xmath34 limit ) are expected to have very large franck - condon overlaps with the electronic ground state @xcite , further enhancing the atom - molecule conversion efficiency and the raman molecular vibrational transition strengths .",
    "the proposed mechanism for inducing the vibrational transitions is optical raman spectroscopy @xcite , using vibrational levels of metastable sr@xmath0 as intermediate states .",
    "the sr@xmath0 ground state electronic potential is 30 thz deep @xcite , and the raman lasers can be stabilized to @xmath35 hz relative to each other @xcite . assuming availability of an optical frequency standard @xcite , a power broadened linewidth of 10 hz , and a signal to noise ratio of 100 , the fractional frequency precision ( or , equivalently , the precision of the @xmath4 test ) approaches @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the averaging time in seconds @xcite .",
    "achieving this precision would lead to an important contribution to the @xmath3 variation data .",
    "presently , a combination of atomic clock data constrains @xmath4 to @xmath38/year @xcite , and the evaluation of astronomical nh@xmath39 spectra constrains @xmath4 to @xmath40/year @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the atomic clock data is dependent on theoretical modeling , since hyperfine transitions depend on both @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the ammonia result is less model - dependent , but relies on poorly controllable cosmological observations , and disagrees with the cosmological h@xmath0 measurements of @xmath4 that indicate non - zero mass ratio variation at the @xmath41/year level @xcite .",
    "ultracold molecule - based clock for precision measurements would provide a model - independent @xmath3-variation - sensitive system with small , controllable experimental uncertainties .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed analysis of various factors affecting frequency measurements between vibrational levels in the ground state of sr@xmath0 in an optical lattice .",
    "we evaluate transition dipole moments between vibrational levels of the ground and metastable states , for determination of the optimal pathways for raman transitions . in addition",
    ", we analyze dynamic polarizabilities of the ground state vibrational levels in order to identify stark - cancellation optical lattice frequencies for vibrational transitions .",
    "finally , we estimate the natural linewidths of the intermediate metastable vibrational levels , in order to obtain realistic estimates of spontaneous scattering rates of the optical lattice and raman spectroscopy photons , and thus of trap losses @xcite .",
    "the electronic potentials and their properties used in the calculations of the vibrationally averaged dipole moments , polarizabilities , and linewidths are presented in ref .",
    "for the production of sr@xmath0 dimers in a particular rovibrational level of the ground state potential ( x@xmath22 ) , it is necessary to study the transition dipole moments and transition probabilities between vibrational levels of the x@xmath22 and the metastable 1(0@xmath42 ) and 1(1@xmath43 ) potentials ( dissociating to the @xmath34 limit ) shown in fig .",
    "[ schema ] .",
    "the numerical labels ( @xmath44 ) of the _ ungerade _ potentials @xmath45 and @xmath46 correspond to the total atomic angular momentum projection onto the internuclear axis of 0 and 1 , respectively . we choose to work with the metastable intermediate states because of the high spectroscopic resolution and low scattering rates that are possible with narrow lines , and due to the large estimated franck - condon overlaps with vibrational levels of x@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "preliminary estimates of the transition strengths between weakly bound metastable and ground state levels were obtained in previous work @xcite . however , for precise molecular metrology , more deeply bound vibrational levels must be optically coupled via a raman scheme .",
    "there is no information on these optical transitions in the literature .",
    "the transition dipole moment between vibrational level @xmath47 of an excited - state @xmath480,1 _ ungerade _ potential and vibrational level @xmath49 of the ground - state @xmath50 ( x@xmath22 ) _ gerade _ potential is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the orientation of the interatomic axis , @xmath53 is a spherical harmonic , @xmath54 is the polarization of the laser field , and @xmath55 , @xmath56 are projections along a laboratory fixed coordinate axis of the total angular momenta @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the vibrationally averaged or reduced matrix element @xmath59 is a radial integral over the @xmath60-dependent relativistic electronic dipole moment @xmath61 and rovibrational wave functions of the electronic state @xmath62 and ground electronic state @xmath63 .",
    "we study transitions to both metastable potentials dissociating to @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ schema ] ) . figures [",
    "fc_0 + ] and [ fc_1 ] show the squares of the vibrationally averaged dipole moments as a function of vibrational energies of the potentials 1(0@xmath42 ) and 1(1@xmath43 ) , respectively , in atomic units @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the electron charge and @xmath66 nm is the bohr radius .",
    "a comparison of the two figures shows that the squares of the dipole moments for 1(0@xmath42 ) are two orders of magnitude larger than for 1(1@xmath43 ) for deeply bound levels .",
    "this is due to the difference in strengths of the electronic transition dipole moments at small separations ( shown in fig .",
    "[ dm_triplet ] ) and the similarity in shape of the x@xmath22 and 1(0@xmath42 ) potentials .",
    "this similarity also explains the localized character of franck - condon factors for a given vibrational level of the x@xmath22 state ( see fig .",
    "however , for weakly bound levels with binding energies less than 500 @xmath20 the squared dipole moments for the two potentials have similar magnitudes .",
    "the electronic dipole moments near the outer turning points have similar magnitudes , and the 1(0@xmath42 ) and 1(1@xmath43 ) potentials are more similar in shape . in our analysis of raman transition rates",
    "we will focus on the 1(0@xmath42 ) potential since it has favorable dipole moments with the ground state .",
    "a raman transition is the process by which we transfer population from an initially occupied vibrational level to a final level via an intermediate state . in this case , both the initial and final levels are @xmath32 rovibrational levels of the x@xmath22 potential while the intermediate level is a @xmath67 rovibrational level of 1(0@xmath42 ) .",
    "the rabi matrix element for this two - photon process is proportional to the product of the dipole moments of both transitions .",
    "we chose the weakly bound @xmath24 level of the x@xmath22 potential as the initial raman state , since it is expected to be most efficiently populated by photoassociation @xcite .",
    "figure [ raman-3 ] shows the dipole moment products for the @xmath24 initial state and the @xmath23 final state as a function of the vibrational energy of the 1(0@xmath42 ) potential .",
    "this pathway was selected in ref .",
    "@xcite for the precision measurement of possible variations of the proton to electron mass ratio .",
    "trapping ultracold molecules in optical lattices via ac stark shifts is key for optimized control and precision @xcite .",
    "optical lattice traps benefit both the reduction of systematic effects , and the achievement of high molecule densities on the order of @xmath68/@xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the stark - cancellation , or _ magic frequency _ , technique @xcite has enabled state - of - the - art neutral atom clocks @xcite .",
    "this approach relies on a suitable crossing of dynamic polarizabilities of the two probed states at a particular lattice wavelength .",
    "this ensures a zero differential stark shift , and a suppression of the inhomogeneous stark broadening .",
    "analogously , stark - cancellation optical lattice frequencies can be sought for specific pairs of the sr@xmath0 vibrational levels .",
    "for example , tuning the lattice frequency near a narrow resonance associated with an optical transition from a vibrational level of x@xmath22 to another one of 1(1@xmath43 ) can help achieve matching polarizabilities of a vibrational level pair of x@xmath22 .",
    "the ac stark shifts of the vibrational levels of illuminated ground state molecules are determined by the dynamic polarizability @xmath70 , which is a function of the radiation frequency @xmath7 and polarization @xmath54 ( @xmath71 is the planck constant ) .",
    "if the sr@xmath0 molecule is in the ground state x@xmath22 , its dynamic polarizability in si units is expressed in terms of the dipole coupling to the rovibrational levels of the excited potentials as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the speed of light , @xmath74 is the electric constant , @xmath75 are @xmath60-dependent electric dipole moments ( containing both radial and angular contributions ) , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the initial @xmath78 and intermediate @xmath79 rovibrational wave functions of the x@xmath22 and @xmath80 electronic states , respectively . the energy @xmath81 is the rovibrational energy of the x@xmath22 state and @xmath82 is the rovibrational energy of the @xmath80 state .",
    "finally , the line widths @xmath83 describe the spontaneous and other decay and loss mechanisms .",
    "equation  ( [ polariz ] ) is a sum over dipole transitions to the rovibrational levels of excited potentials ; this includes contributions from the continuum of the @xmath80 states as well .",
    "this sum can be truncated if transitions have negligible electric dipole moments or large detunings . in the case of sr@xmath0 ,",
    "the sum only includes contributions from potentials with @xmath84 and _ ungerade _ symmetry . the potentials and transition dipole moments are calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the frequency of the optical lattice is in the near infrared range , where the laser can be tuned close to a transition from a ground state vibrational level to a vibrational level of the 1(1@xmath43 ) potential ( fig . [ schema ] ) .",
    "we employ two approaches to finding either vibrational levels with the same stark shift , or the stark - cancellation light frequency for a given pair of levels .",
    "the first approach is to analyze the dependence of the baseline molecular polarizability on the vibrational quantum number for a fixed laser frequency and look for non - monotonic behavior , thus allowing certain pairs of vibrational levels to have the same stark shifts .",
    "the second approach is to rely on sharp polarizability resonances arising from presence of vibrational levels in the metastable potentials as shown in fig .",
    "[ schema ] .",
    "while the latter method allows significantly more flexibility , care must be taken to ensure low incoherent photon scattering rates @xcite .    for simultaneous trapping of sr@xmath0 molecules in different vibrational levels of the x@xmath22 potential in a stark - cancellation regime",
    ", we can use the first approach and search for vibrational levels of x@xmath22 that have equal polarizabilities .",
    "figure [ infra_red ] shows the dynamic polarizability at the infrared laser frequency of 10600 @xmath20 as a function of the vibrational quantum number of the x@xmath22 potential for the rotational level @xmath57=0 .",
    "the polarizability tends to decrease with increasing vibrational quantum number ; exceptions occur for @xmath85 vibrational levels .",
    "analysis of the individual contributions to the polarizability shows that the dip near @xmath86 is due to an avoided crossing between relativistic @xmath87 excited potentials , which coincides with the outer turning point of the @xmath86 vibrational level of the ground state potential . as a result",
    ", we can find matching polarizabilities for the higher vibrational levels .",
    "however , there is a possibility that this dip is an artifact of our method of calculation .",
    "we assumed that the vibrational motion is purely adiabatic , which might not be accurate for this avoided crossing .",
    "it would require a multichannel calculation of the vibrational levels to test our results .",

    "figure [ polar ] shows three resonances in the range of 10700 @xmath20 to 11300 @xmath20 with matching polarizabilities for the @xmath92 and @xmath93 vibrational levels .",

    "other resonances could be chosen for optical lattice frequencies to facilitate precision measurements , for example , those in the laser frequency range of 13500 - 14600 @xmath20 .",
    "these resonances arise from transitions between vibrational levels of the x@xmath22 and 1(0@xmath42 ) potentials .",

    "however , the general polarizability trends , the density of vibrational levels , and the relative line strengths are expected to remain close to our present predictions .",
    "linewidths of the vibrational levels of the @xmath95 and @xmath96 potentials are important for estimating incoherent scattering rates of the raman spectroscopy light and of the stark - cancellation optical lattice trap , as well as of near - resonant stark shifts @xcite .",
