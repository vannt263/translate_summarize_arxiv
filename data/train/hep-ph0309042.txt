    "the search for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation , generally believed to be one or more scalar @xmath1 higgs doublets , remains one of the premier tasks of high energy physics .",
    "fits to precision electroweak data have for some time suggested a relatively small higgs boson mass , in case of the standard model ( sm ) of order @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the lhc will have the capability to search for physical higgs boson(s ) over a huge mass range . in the sm case",
    "it will have multiple coverage of search channels for any given higgs mass , in particular for the intermediate mass range  @xcite .",
    "this coverage relies heavily on higgs production via weak boson fusion ( wbf ) .",
    "the advantage of wbf , where the scattered final - state quarks receive significant transverse momentum and are observed in the detector as far - forward / backward jets , is strong reduction of qcd backgrounds due to the kinematical configuration of the colored part of the event . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , all five of the physical higgs bosons may not be observable over all of mssm parameter space .",
    "however , a well - established no - lose theorem guarantees that at least one of the two cp - even neutral states will be seen in wbf with subsequent decay to either tau leptons or gauge bosons , after taking into account the lep limits  @xcite . for even more complex models there",
    "exists a no - lose theorem for the nmssm  @xcite , which also relies on wbf higgs production , but includes decay modes which do not occur in simpler models .",
    "however , the set of possible symmetry breaking scenarios is much larger than these models , and it is natural to consider whether the lhc can similarly guarantee discovery for other cases . a popular way to try to hide a higgs sector from collider searches is via additional fields .",
    "these can have two effects : first , one can try to reduce the branching fractions to observable decay modes , in analogy to invisible higgs decays , for example in supersymmetry .",
    "the so - called stealth model  @xcite achieves this through the presence of additional singlets , which couple ( strongly ) to the higgs boson and lead to a large invisible decay width .",
    "the search for these particles is tedious for two reasons , the invisible decay and their huge width , which vastly exceeds the experimental mass resolution and hence becomes a limiting factor in background suppression .",
    "nevertheless , the invisible decay should in principle be observable at the lhc in weak boson fusion , because the recoiling tagging jets are not sensitive to the higgs mass , as long as the particle is in the intermediate mass range  @xcite .",
    "another alternative scenario inflates the higgs signal width via a large number of higgs doublets , with the measured vacuum expectation value distributed among them  @xcite .",
    "multiple cp - even neutral higgs bosons exist , each with diminished coupling to weak bosons .",
    "the wbf production rate of any one of these can be suppressed considerably , such that by itself it would be lost in the background . to make matters worse , each higgs boson in general",
    "has a different mass , forming a broad spectrum of states .",
    "poor lhc detector resolution may smear the individual peaks out to a smooth continuum .",
    "these models lead to the speculation that higgs sector may be unidentifiable at the lhc , even though high - energy @xmath3 scattering would clearly observe unitarity  @xcite .",
    "to decide whether there really is a hole in the lhc higgs boson discovery potential , we investigate these continuum models in detail . our analysis of wbf production of such a continuum of higgs bosons , followed by decay to dileptons ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) via a pair of @xmath7 bosons confirms the robustness of the wbf higgs searches in the case of non  standard higgs sectors .",
    "the signal can easily be observed , and typically distinguished from a sm higgs sector with only modest integrated luminosity , @xmath8 , via study of the transverse mass distribution .",
    "the continuum model  @xcite is merely a generalization of the sm to an arbitrary number of @xmath1 higgs doublets   symmetry . ] .",
    "the vacuum expectation values @xmath9 , are bound by the measurement @xmath10 with the equal sign @xmath11 in the case of only singlet and doublet higgs fields which we consider in this letter .",
    "each doublet gives rise to one cp - even neutral higgs boson @xmath12 .",
    "there are in addition a large number of charged and cp - odd neutral higgs bosons which can all be sufficiently heavy as to be unobservable .",
    "the question arises : given that none of the heavy states could be found , can lhc discover any of the @xmath12 , and if so can it distinguish them from the sm higgs boson ?",
    "the gauge couplings of the higgs boson to weak bosons is proportional to @xmath13 , therefore it is modified for the cp - even higgs boson of each doublet by the single factor @xmath14 .",
    "the partial width of a higgs to weak bosons is then @xmath15 .",
    "a further constraint from electroweak precision data is  @xcite @xmath16 which also holds for any general supersymmetric higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "each sm fermion gets its mass in small pieces from the many higgs fields : @xmath17 . in general",
    ", these yukawa couplings need not be equal . in the minimal model , which assumes that ultimately the flavor sector comes from some universal condition , each @xmath1 higgs doublet experiences the same set of yukawa couplings @xmath18 . matching the universal yukawa coupling @xmath19 with its sm counterpart we are left with @xmath20 .",
    "hence , the higgs partial widths to fermions acquire scaling factors @xmath21 .",
    "the higgs decay properties are particularly close to the sm properties in the limit of @xmath22 higgs fields with identical vacuum expectation values @xmath23 . each partial width to @xmath24 bosons",
    "becomes @xmath25 .",
    "the partial widths to fermions are scaled by the same factor @xmath26 .",
    "thus , to leading order all branching fractions for one of the many higgs fields are identical to the sm values for the same higgs mass ; only the total width is suppressed by a factor @xmath27 .",
    "the limiting case of a large number of higgs fields is a higgs continuum  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the distribution of vacuum expectation values becomes a continuous quantity , @xmath28 , expressed as a function of the physical higgs boson mass .",
    "the sum rules in this case become : @xmath29 as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the weak production cross section for any point in the physical higgs continuum is minimized when all the couplings to gauge bosons are set equal .",
    "this is precisely the continuum limit of the model with @xmath22 equal values @xmath30 , which leaves the higgs branching fractions unaffected to leading order .",
    "taking the direct lep constraints  @xcite together with the precision data , we find a scenario which is maximally likely to escape detection : @xmath31 for 70 gev @xmath32 and @xmath33 elsewhere .",
    "we adopt this case to illustrate our analysis , then slightly vary this assumption in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "we simulate @xmath34 collisions at the lhc , @xmath35  tev , for the final state @xmath36 , calculating all signal and background cross sections with full tree level matrix elements for the contributing subprocesses .",
    "@xmath37 are any combination of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which are easily identified by the detectors with high efficiency .",
    "we employ cteq6l1 parton distribution functions  @xcite throughout . unless otherwise noted the factorization scale is chosen as @xmath40 min(@xmath41 ) of the defined jets .",
    "the signal is calculated with matrix elements constructed by madgraph  @xcite , including exact matrix elements for the decay @xmath42 to maintain the decay helicity correlations  @xcite on which the analysis rests .",
    "the backgrounds consist of both qcd and ew processes leading to two far forward / backward jets , with a central pair of oppositely - charged leptons @xmath38 or @xmath39 , and large missing transverse energy . although qcd processes with the same number of final state partons have much larger cross sections than the counterpart ew processes , in the region of phase space with two tagging jets the ew contribution can easily be of the same size as the qcd component .",
    "we thus consider the qcd processes @xmath43  + jets , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and the ew processes @xmath44 and @xmath45  @xcite , including correction factors for off - shell top quark effects  @xcite .",
    "we also include here for the first time as a background @xmath7-fusion single - top production  @xcite , @xmath46 , where the light jet and hard - scattered @xmath47 jet appear as the far forward / backward tagging jets , the top quark decays semi - leptonically , and its daughter @xmath47 quark also decays semi - leptonically .",
    "we use exact matrix elements for the @xmath47 decay to both charm and up quarks .",
    "the characteristics of wbf higgs boson production are a pair of very far forward / backward tagging jets with significant transverse momentum and large invariant mass between them .",
    "furthermore , the higgs boson is produced centrally , and the decay products will therefore typically lie between the tagging jets , independent of the higgs boson decay mode . since the only modification to our signal here is a spectrum of higgs boson masses rather than a single resonance , we employ the same optimized jet cuts as in the experimental simulation presented of ref .",
    "these do not vary significantly from those of the original study  @xcite , but do include more current understanding of detector and trigger requirements : @xmath48 the top pair background will frequently contain an extra central @xmath47 jet with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we veto these in the same manner as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although we are now examining a continuum of higgs boson masses , they decay in the same manner as in the previous studies .",
    "the lepton cuts used therein take into account the detector observability and the angular correlations of the decay . since neither change fundamentally , we also use the same lepton cuts as in ref .",
    "@xcite :   @xmath51 along with the @xmath52 cut is the lepton isolation criteria for the semileptonic @xmath47 decay in @xmath53 events : the hadronic remnant must have @xmath54  gev if it lies within a cone of @xmath55 of the lepton .",
    "the real tau backgrounds are large , especially the qcd component , but are reducible by reconstructing these taus  @xcite . in the collinear decay approximation ,",
    "the fraction of tau energy that each charged lepton takes with it in the decay ( @xmath56 ) is solved for the actual charged lepton momenta and the missing energy in the transverse directions .",
    "events with real tau pairs typically have @xmath57 lying between the charged lepton flight directions ; leptonic @xmath3 events typically do not , and will most often give a fake  tau reconstruction with negative @xmath56 values .",
    "we therefore reject events with two positive @xmath56 values and an invariant tau pair mass of @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "qcd @xmath59 events with dual semileptonic @xmath47 decays constitutes a very large background to ew @xmath60 events  @xcite .",
    "however , they typically give a small transverse momentum for the reconstructed higgs boson , because the leptons do not pass the isolation cut from the charm quark unless the parent @xmath47 quark is soft .",
    "we therefore employ dual two - dimensional cuts  @xcite which suppress the @xmath59 background by more than two orders of magnitude : @xmath61 we then reduce qcd @xmath59 events to an insignificant level by imposing a conditional cut on the transverse momentum  @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "both cuts result in only trivial signal rejection .",
    "in the case of same lepton flavors , low mass @xmath64 pairs originating from @xmath65 exhibit a large cross section and are suppressed by requiring that the dilepton invariant mass is larger than @xmath66  @xcite . to reduce the background arising from @xmath67 , where the missing transverse momentum is generated by detector effects",
    ", we further require the missing transverse momentum to be larger than @xmath68  @xcite . in brief",
    ", we impose the additional cuts on the same flavor final state : @xmath69 finally , we note that the single - top background is dominated by the semileptonic @xmath47 decay @xmath70 , rather than @xmath71 , although the ckm matrix element is larger in the latter case . because the kinematics of the lighter quark decay allows more momentum of the light quark transverse to the @xmath47 flight direction , it can more often lie outside the lepton isolation cone .",
    "the size of the signal which could be observed at the lhc in the channel described above depends critically on the continuum mass window .",
    "we know that for flat @xmath31 the branching fraction to @xmath3 is reduced for small higgs masses . in other words ,",
    "the continuum signal at low masses will be suppressed by the @xmath3 branching fraction , despite the larger higgs production cross section .",
    "large continuum masses will be production phase space suppressed , the @xmath72 branching fraction becomes significant , and the selection cuts are not optimized for @xmath73 .",
    "hence , even a model with a wide range of continuum masses will still leave the event sample dominated by higgs masses around the @xmath3 threshold . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show the contribution from a continuum higgs sector , @xmath74  gev , to the total @xmath44 cross section .",
    "as expected , the bulk of the signal events originate from higgs masses around @xmath75 .",
    "as the final state events contain two unobservable neutrinos and are thus not fully reconstructible , we can not directly observe the @xmath76 distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "however , the general behavior can be read off the measurable @xmath3 transverse mass distribution  @xcite , @xmath77 which for a single resonance exhibits a sharp edge near the invariant @xmath3 mass @xmath78 .",
    "the neutrino pair transverse momentum is determined as the missing transverse momentum @xmath79 .",
    "the invariant mass of the neutrino pair can not be observed , so we replace it with the lepton pair invariant mass @xmath80  @xcite , an approximation which is exact for @xmath81 , and very good over the intermediate higgs mass range the @xmath3 transverse mass can be written as @xmath82 .",
    "this alternative definition can be used to distinguish signal and background , but does not work particularly well in distinguishing continuum higgs sectors from the sm . ] .",
    "on average the two kinds of @xmath7 decay fermions will give the same distributions , even though on an event - by - events basis this approximation violates the condition @xmath83 .",
    "detector effects , mostly mismeasurement of the missing transverse momentum due to the presence of the hadronic forward tagging jets , will dull the edge in @xmath84 somewhat , but the distribution remains extremely important  @xcite .    for a continuum model we indeed observe a transverse mass peak around the @xmath3 threshold , but with a considerable tail extending to larger @xmath84 values and therefore larger continuum higgs masses . for a flat continuum mass spectrum , the position of the peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigback ] is approximately the peak position of the @xmath84 curve given by a sm higgs whose mass maximizes the function @xmath85 .",
    ".signal and background cross sections [ fb ] after all kinematic cuts as discussed in the text .",
    "the first two columns refer to different - flavor ( @xmath86 ) final states , while the last two columns give results for the same - flavor ( @xmath87 ) sample .",
    "the first row is the continuum higgs model considered , and we show the sm signal which has the same peak value of @xmath88 in the second row for comparison .",
    "the last three rows display the total background for each channel , with and without the minijet veto ; the signal - to - background ratio for the continuum model ; and the required integrated luminosity to observe the continuum model signal over the sm background . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath89 satisfies the slightly weaker constraint @xmath90 ( see eq .",
    "[ constraint ] ) .",
    "having described how the multi higgs resonance model is naturally picked up by the wbf higgs search with decay to @xmath7 bosons , we briefly describe how the other lhc higgs boson search channels would be affected by this model .",
    "the decay to @xmath7 pairs is not the only decay channel proven capable of giving rapid higgs boson discovery in wbf processes .",
    "the decay to tau leptons in this production channel is in fact the most solid channel in the mssm , where it can even distinguish between the two cp - even scalar mass peaks  @xcite .",
    "however , a mass peak is precisely where the multi - resonance model avoids discovery .",
    "no matter how wide the spread in higgs boson masses becomes , the wbf tau decay channel can see only the range between about 115 and 145  gev . in",
    "that range the signal would be approximately flat in tau pair invariant mass , appearing to be an unexplained enhancement in the @xmath91 breit - wigner tail above the peak .",
    "wbf production and decay to photon pairs is also a useful channel  @xcite , but similarly would give an essentially flat invariant mass distribution . because this channel yields very few events , it works in the sm case only because the detectors have a very narrow resolution in photon pair invariant mass . spreading a very small number of signal events out from a 2  gev window to over a @xmath92  gev range would result in complete loss of detectability .",
    "seeing a higgs signal in the wbf channel decaying to a @xmath7 pair and not seeing it in the @xmath93 decays in an accessible mass range would point to a higgs sector beyond the sm , possibly a continuum model .",
    "the two most powerful decay channels for measuring the higgs boson mass are photon pairs and the `` golden mode '' of four leptons ( via a @xmath94 boson pair )  @xcite , produced in gluon fusion  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this feature turns into the worst disadvantage once the mass window in the analysis has to be several tens of gev .",
    "a side - band analysis of the continuum background will not work because there is no true resonance , and the significance of the signal will vanish . on the other hand , we expect the @xmath3 decay would work similarly well as in the the wbf process .",
    "the @xmath95 invariant mass shown in fig.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite will change in analogy to the transverse mass in the wbf channel , but without a detailed simulation ( beyond the scope of this work ) it is not clear if the shape change would allow sm v. multi - resonance higgs sector discrimination .    despite the relatively small cross section  @xcite , top quark events",
    "are highly distinctive and associated production with a higgs boson has as a result received much interest . for @xmath96  gev",
    "the dominant decay mode is to a pair of bottom quarks , which appears as a very small peak near the @xmath97 continuum peak  @xcite .",
    "such a signal spread out via continuum higgs production would obviously be immediately lost in the background .",
    "similarly for decay to photon pairs , as in wbf or inclusive higgs boson production . for @xmath98  gev",
    "the dominant decay is to @xmath7 pairs",
    ". this will be a very useful channel for measuring the top yukawa coupling  @xcite , if the higgs sector is sm - like and @xmath98  gev .",
    "however , the multi - lepton final states used in this planned analysis do not permit full reconstruction , so the higgs boson mass is never identified .",
    "because of the lack of need for such a resonance , this channel should work nearly as well as in the sm case , although a detailed investigation is again beyond the scope of our present work .",
    "if the higgs boson is produced in association with a weak gauge boson it can be searched for in the photon decay channel  @xcite , because of the very narrow resonance peak distinguishable above a large background .",
    "however , just as in the case of decay to photon pairs in all the other production channels , there is no longer any resonance , and the signal will be lost in the continuum background .",
    "there is also a small signal for @xmath99 in the sm  @xcite , but as with @xmath100 production the peak is similarly lost in the very large @xmath101 qcd continuum  @xcite .",
    "thus , none of these modes would be observable .",
    "we have shown that continuum higgs models do not present any problem for lhc higgs discovery .",
    "if the coupling to gauge bosons is spread over a mass range @xmath102 these continuum higgs events will automatically appear in the searches for higgs boson produced in weak boson fusion , with subsequent decay to @xmath103 and missing transverse energy via @xmath7 pairs .",
    "the broad nature of the higgs resonance has no major impact on this search channel , because the corresponding standard model search channel already benefits from hugely suppressed backgrounds , typically much less than the level of the signal . in the case of a continuum higgs sector , the signal to background ratio typically is in the range @xmath104 , still extremely good .",
    "discovery of the most difficult case studied would require only about 50  fb@xmath105 , and almost all cases require less than 30  fb@xmath105 .",
    "our analysis is not subject to detector uncertainties such as poorly - modeled @xmath106 resolution , or identification and measurement of the tagging jets , that are known with less certainty for high - luminosity running ; only low - luminosity running is needed for discovery in this channel .",
    "using the nearly symmetric behavior of the transverse @xmath3 mass for continuum higgs sectors , we can distinguish these models from the sm without relying on the total rate .",
    "these features are largely independent of the detailed spectrum @xmath28 of the continuum higgs sector and of the distribution of the coupling @xmath107 .",
    "the integrated luminosity required to distinguish such a sector from the sm is typically @xmath108",
    "fb@xmath105 , but can be as large as 900  fb@xmath105 for the most difficult case studied , where the continuum is spread over a mass region less than 150  gev .",
    "search strategies not using @xmath3 final states will almost universally be unable to see these states , as they require a sharp peak in a mass spectrum , which does not exist in the flat - spectrum continuum models .",
    "such an observation could be interpreted as a sign of a higgs sector more complex than that of the sm ,  a continuum sector .",
