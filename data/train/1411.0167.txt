    "so , the reason of the difference between all the sample groups is mainly the sample quality , which is determined by two factors : 1 )  impurity contents , 2 ) degrees of structural perfection .    the impurity contents were different : the low - quality samples ( @xmath100 v / cm )  group a and good - quality samples ( @xmath5 = 3 - 15 v / cm )  groups b and c. unfortunately we had no high - quality samples ( @xmath101  v / cm ) .",

    "o_-tas@xmath0 samples doped by nb ( concentration @xmath102% ) with a huge plateau . in our opinion",
    "the additional reason of the difference between the groups is due to different degrees of structural perfection , which we unfortunately can not control .",
    "it seems a big plateau is caused by a structural inhomogeneity of the crystal .",
    "two different types of the inhomogeneity ( which we can not distinguish yet ) may take place .",
    "1 ) a sample may be an aggregate of a few parallel crystals with different @xmath5 values ( the longitudinal stripe structure is often seen in thick _",
    "o_-tas@xmath0 crystals ) .",
    "2 ) a sample may be deformed by outside factors  for example by stretch arising in the process of contacts fabrication .",
    "our preliminary results obtained for _ o_-tas@xmath0 crystals with different degrees of the longitudinal stretch confirm this assumption .",
    "it seems impurities prevent a sample from outside deformation , it leads to the reduction of the stretch possibility of the low - quality  samples .",
    "it also worth to mention that @xmath21 dependencies of our samples in general are consistent with the same ones for high quality _",
    "m-_tas@xmath0 sample reported in @xcite .",
    "moreover the same fine structure is also present but was not remarked and discussed in @xcite .",
    "the similar peculiarities of iv - curves were also observed and analyzed in impure samples of _ o-_tas@xmath0 at @xmath72  k @xcite where they were attributed to the difference of the pinning potentials provided by various impurities .",

    "another interesting observation is very strong and unusual @xmath34 dependence .",
    "the concurrence of two physical mechanisms may result in such a complex behavior .",
    "on the one hand , spatial separation of electrons and holes caused by fluctuations of the chemical potential ( which are significant at low @xmath2 @xcite ) complicates their recombination process @xcite .",

    "<S> photoconduction in the monoclinic phase of quasi - one - dimensional conductor tas@xmath0 has been observed at @xmath1  k. it was studied jointly with low - temperature ohmic and non - linear dark conduction . </S>",
    "<S> the strong sample quality dependence of both photoconduction and dark conduction at this temperature region has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> together with a similarity of the main features of the photoconduction characteristic of both monoclinic ( _ m-_tas@xmath0 ) and orthorhombic ( _ o-_tas@xmath0 ) samples the following new peculiarities of photoconduction in _ m-_tas@xmath0 were found : 1 ) the dependence of the activation energy of photoconduction on temperature , @xmath2 , 2 ) the change of the recombination mechanism from the linear type to the collisional one at low @xmath2 with a sample quality growth , 3 ) the existence of a fine structure of the electric - field dependence of photoconduction . </S>",
