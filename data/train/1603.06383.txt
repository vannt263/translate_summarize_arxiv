    "wilson and fisher calculation of the critical exponents for the scalar @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) model by analysis of the renormalization group ( rg ) equations @xcite was a groundbreaking discovery .",
    "the perturbation expansions of the beta functions of the rg equations turned out to be @xmath0 expansions , and the rules how to calculate the coefficients in such expansions were formulated . immediately after that @xmath3 model with cubic anisotropy term was studied by aharony @xcite ( see also refs . ) . later",
    "the @xmath0 expansion was used to derive the rg equations for the vector @xmath1 model with quenched scalar disorder @xcite ( see also ref . ) . and",
    "for the model with cubic anisotropy and such disorder , also for the model with random direction of the anisotropy axis @xcite .",
    "the quenched disorder was taken into account in the mentioned above works by the replica method @xcite .",
    "this method was advanced by dotsenko et al .",
    "@xcite , who have shown that the replica symmetry , assumed in the previous application of the method to the rg theory , can be spontaneously broken .",
    "( this kind of replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) was previously discovered by parisi in the theory of spin glasses @xcite . )",
    "the aim of the present communication is generalization of the well known rg equations for the two anisotropic models mentioned above : the model with cubic anisotropy and that with random direction of the anisotropy axis for the case of rsb .",
    "we also hope that the way we arrive to such generalization will be of some methodic interest .",
    "the scalar @xmath1 model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath4=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla\\phi\\right)^2+\\tau\\phi^2 + g\\phi^4=h_0+v,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 represents the first term of the hamiltonian and @xmath6 the two other terms ; the space has dimension @xmath7 .",
    "we implement the rg by changing the microscopic cut - off implicit in the problem from @xmath8 to @xmath9 and asking how the parameters of the model should be changed to preserve the partition function @xmath10 .",
    "considering @xmath6 as a perturbation one obtains the rg equations for the parameters @xcite , with the beta functions being infinite series in the powers of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the problem of calculation of the coefficients in the rg equations has two parts : calculation of momentum ( coordinate ) integrals and calculation of combinatoric multipliers .",
    "the integration part of the problem is exactly the same for any hamiltonian with the multicomponent field @xmath13 ( calligraphic letter can stand for index of any origin ) and quartic interaction .",
    "@xmath14=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\cal{a}}\\left(\\nabla\\phi_{\\cal a}\\right)^2 + v(\\phi_{\\cal a}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a polynomial function of @xmath15 containing terms of the second and forth degree .",
    "only combinatoric multipliers of the perturbation series terms depend upon the specific hamiltonian .    more specifically , each term in the perturbation series expansion of the beta functions for the generic hamiltonian is the product of that for the scalar @xmath1 model , given by integration demanded by the relevant diagram(s ) , and the combinatoric multiplier given by contraction of the interaction ( [ v ] ) demanded by this same diagram(s ) .    to express this idea",
    "we can decompose the fields as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a fluctuating basic field , and @xmath18 shows , so to say , `` direction '' of the field . to solve the combinatoric part of the problem we can deal with the symbolic hamiltonian containing only @xmath18 .",
    "for example , for the vector @xmath1 model we can use @xmath19    in general case we have to operate with @xmath20 where the effective vertices @xmath21 are problem specific homogeneous polynomials of the second or fourth degree of @xmath18 fields .",
    "to first order in @xmath0 the rg equations are @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the surface of the sphere of unit radius in @xmath7 dimensions . recalling that the beta functions are due to box and tadpole diagram respectively we understand that the rg equations for the generic hamiltonian can be presented as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the natural scale dimension of @xmath21 : @xmath28 when @xmath21 is the polynomial of the forth degree , and @xmath29 when @xmath21 is the polynomial of the second degree , and the coefficients @xmath30 are found from the equation @xmath31 where the sign @xmath32 means multiplication and double contraction .",

    "the scheme of the replica method can be described in the following steps @xcite .",
