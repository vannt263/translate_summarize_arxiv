    "over the past years intensive investigations into the new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been undertaken@xcite . as the simplest extension of the sm ,",
    "the supersymmetric model ( susy ) is the most attractive one . in general extended models of the sm ,",
    "electroweak gauge invariance forbids terms in the sm lagrangian that change either baryon number or lepton number , such terms are allowed in the most general supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the sm , but they may lead to an unacceptable short proton lifetime , one way to evade the proton - decay problem is to impose a discrete symmetry conservation called r - parity ( @xmath4 ) conservation . in this case , all supersymmetric partner particles must be pair - produced , thus the lightest of superparticles must be stable .    the r - parity violation ( @xmath5 ) implies either lepton number or baryon number being broken , and it will change the feature of the susy models a lot . due to the lack of experimental tests for @xmath4 conservation , the @xmath4 violation case is also equally well motivated in the supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "susy models with @xmath5 can provide many interesting phenomena .",
    "recently there are some investigations on the signal on @xmath4 violation @xcite@xcite@xcite , because of experimentally observed discrepancies .    in the last few years",
    ", many efforts were made to find @xmath5 interactions in experiments .",
    "unfortunately , up to now we have only some upper limits on @xmath5 parameters , such as b - violating @xmath5 parameters ( @xmath6 ) and l - violating @xmath5 parameters(@xmath7 and @xmath8)@xcite@xcite@xcite ( the parameters will be defined clearly in the following sector ) .",
    "therefore , trying to find the signal of @xmath4 violation or getting more stringent constraints on the parameters in future experiments , is a promising task .",
    "the popular way to find a @xmath4 violation signal is to detect the decay of the lightest supersymmetric particle(lsp)@xcite @xcite@xcite , but it is difficult experimentally especially at hadron colliders . the best signal for @xmath5 at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the resonant sneutrino production through a @xmath8 or a @xmath6 coupling constant , respectively@xcite . because the c.m.s energy continuous distribution of the colliding partons inside protons at the hadron colliders , a intermediate resonance can be probed over a rather wide mass range .",
    "then a single chargino can be produced by the sneutrino decays , which can be measured through the detection of its three - leptons signature .",
    "there are two mechanisms at parton level to produce @xmath9 in an explicit r - parity violating susy theory at pp colliders .",
    "one is via quark and antiquark ( @xmath10 ) annihilation which is allowed at tree - level .",
    "the single lightest chargino production at the lhc as induced by the resonant sneutrino production @xmath11 was studied by g. moreau et.al.@xcite .",
    "another mechanism is via gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "the single lightest chargino production process via gluon - gluon fusion , which will take place at the lowest order by one - loop diagrams , could be also significant due to large gluon luminosity in distribution function of proton .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the resonant sneutrino particle production via gluon - gluon fusion at the lhc operating at the energy of @xmath12 .",
    "we arrange this paper as follows . in sec.ii",

    "it is not necessary to consider the renormalization .",
    "the generic feynman diagrams contributing to the subprocess in the mssm without r - parity at one - loop level are depicted in fig.1 , where the exchange of incoming gluons in fig.1@xmath29 and fig.1@xmath30 are not shown .",
    "we divide all the one - loop diagrams in fig.1 into three groups : ( 1 ) box diagrams shown in fig.1(a ) , ( 2 ) quartic interaction diagrams in fig.1(b ) , ( 3 ) triangle diagrams shown in fig.1(c ) . in this work ,",

    "the factorization scale q was chosen as the average of the final particles masses @xmath61 .",
    "in this section , we present some numerical results of the total cross section from the complete one - loop diagrams for the processes @xmath62 . in our numerical calculation to get the low energy scenario from the msugra@xcite , the complete 2-loop renormalisation group equations(rge s ) of the superpotential parameters for the supersymmetric standard model including the full set of r - parity violating couplings have been obtained in @xcite , here we neglect the effects of r - parity violation in the rge s for simplicity .",

    "the gut scale boundary conditions are imposed and the rge s are run back to @xmath63 , again taking threshold into account .",
    "we chose @xmath4-parity violating parameters concerned in the subprocess via gluon - gluon fusion to be @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which satisfy the constraints given by @xcite . the sm input parameters are chosen as : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",

    "we calculate the cross sections at the lhc with the energies of @xmath53 being @xmath12 . for the comparison",
    ", we also present the cross section of @xmath88 via quark - antiquark with the same input parameters in fig.2 .",
    "it shows the cross section contribution to parent process at hadron collider from subprocess @xmath89 can be competitive with that via @xmath90 annihilation .",
    "then the production mechanism of subprocess @xmath91 should be considered in detecting the @xmath31 signals in this parameter space .",
    "we can see from fig.2 that the cross sections for @xmath92 decreases with the increment of the mass of @xmath35 .",
    "it can reach 10.3 femto barn when @xmath93 is about @xmath86 .    in fig.3 we present the cross sections of @xmath77 productions versus the mass of @xmath76 sneutrino with the collision energy of hadron being @xmath12 , where the input parameters are chosen as @xmath94 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in the msugra scenario ,",
    "when @xmath95 increases from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , the mass of @xmath76 sneutrino ranges from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "we can see from fig.3 that the cross section decreases rapidly with the increment of the mass of @xmath76 sneutrino , this is because the cross section is enhanced by the @xmath76 sneutrino resonance effects in the lower @xmath76 sneutrino mass range .",
    "we also show the cross section contributed by the @xmath100 channel diagrams .",
    "it shows that the cross section are mostly contributed by the effects of resonance , only when the mass of @xmath76 sneutrino is larger than @xmath101 , the non - resonant contributions can reach about @xmath102 to the total cross sections .",
    "the cross sections for the production of single chargino accompanied by @xmath76 lepton via gluon - gluon versus @xmath53 with @xmath103 gev , @xmath104 gev , @xmath105 gev , @xmath106=4 are depicted in fig.4 .",
    "the solid line is for @xmath107 , and the dashed line is for @xmath108 .",
    "the discrepancy between these two curves is not very large .",
    "this feature can be seen also in the corresponding curves in fig.2 and fig.3 .",
    "it shows that the production rate of process @xmath109 is not very sensitive to the sign of parameter @xmath76 .",
    "finally , we will discuss the relationship between the cross section and the parameter @xmath110 .",
    "the cross section of @xmath34 production via @xmath90 annihilation is scaled by @xmath111 .",
    "while the cross section via @xmath55 should take the sum of three generation of ( s)quarks loop , but the main contribution to the cross section is from the third generation for the coupling coefficient of the third generation is much larger than the first and second generation , then the cross section is nearly proportional to the @xmath112 .",
    "if @xmath113 is less than 0.18 , the cross section via @xmath55 will be less than 3.5 femto barn , in this case , compared with the process of @xmath90 annihilation , it can be neglected .",
    "but if @xmath113 is larger than the value we discussed , the process via @xmath55 will play a more important rule in @xmath50 collision .",
    "in fact , the maximal possible cross section could be somewhat higher than indicated in fig.3 , because the upper bounds of r - parity violation couplings can be higher for heavy sparticls .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the production of single chargino @xmath0 associated with @xmath76 lepton with explicit @xmath4-violation at hadron colliders . the production rates via gluon - gluon fusion at the lhc are numerically analysed in the msugra scenario with some typical parameter sets .",
    "the results show that the cross section of the @xmath2 production via gluon - gluon collisions can reach about some femto barn to hundreds femto barn at the lhc with our chosen parameters .",
    "it shows that the production mechanism via gluon - gluon fusion can be competitive with that from quark - antiquark annihilation process .",
    "therefore , in detecting the @xmath114 productions at the lhc to search for the signals of both susy and @xmath4 violation , we should consider not only the @xmath114 production subprocesses via quark - antiquark annihilation , but also those via the gluon - gluon fusion .",
