    "an intriguing manifestation of quantum theory in macroscopic bodies is the non - contact friction between objects in relative motion .",
    "for example , two surfaces ( or half - spaces ) moving in parallel experience a frictional force if the objects material is lossy  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this force is the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field within and between the objects ; the same fluctuations also give rise to casimir / van der waals forces . in brief ,",
    "quantum fluctuations induce currents in each object , which then couple to result in the interaction between them . for moving objects ,",
    "a phase lag between currents leads to a frictional force between them .",
    "for parallel plates ( half - spaces ) , the friction force is related to the amplitude of the reflected wave upon scattering of an incident wave from each surface ( formalized into a reflection matrix below ) @xcite . due to its quantum origin",
    ", friction persists even at zero temperature , where it is related to the imaginary part of the reflection matrix corresponding to evanescent waves .",
    "it is usually assumed that the dielectric ( or response ) function itself has an imaginary part due to dissipative properties of the material ; this then leads to an imaginary reflection matrix and hence friction @xcite .",
    "however , this is not necessary as , even for a vanishingly small loss , evanescent waves lead to an imaginary reflection matrix .",
    "we consider non - dispersive half - spaces described by a real constant dielectric function , such that light propagates in the medium with a constant ( reduced ) speed .",
    "note that the frequency - independence of the dielectric function follows from a vanishing imaginary part , due to kramers - kronig relations .",
    "we show that when the velocity of moving half - spaces , in their _ center - of - mass _ frame , is larger than the phase speed of light in the medium , a frictional force arises between them .",
    "this is in fact a quantum analog of the well - known _ classical cherenkov _ radiation .",
    "we elaborate on the relation between the friction , and radiation in the gap as well as within the half - spaces .",
    "we emphasize , however , that _ dispersive _ half - spaces can experience friction at any velocity .",
    "even non - dispersive bodies moving non - uniformly experience vacuum friction at arbitrarily low speeds .",
    "quantum cherenkov radiation was first discovered by ginzburg and frank  @xcite in a rather different setup .",
    "they argued that when an object ( an atom , for example ) moves inertially and superluminally , i.e. larger than the phase speed of light in a medium , it spontaneously emits photons ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for subsequent reviews by ginzburg .",
    "this phenomenon is intimately related to _ superradiance _ ,",
    "first discovered by zeldovich  @xcite in the context of rotating objects and black holes : a rotating body amplifies certain incident waves even if it is lossy .",
    "the underlying physics is that a moving object ( atom ) can lose energy by getting excited .",
    "this is because , at superluminal velocities , an excitation in the rest - frame of the object corresponds to a loss of energy in the _ lab _ frame .",
    "ginzburg and frank refer to this eventuality as the _ anomalous _ doppler effect  @xcite ; see also ref .",
    ".    since these unusual observations span several subfields of physics , we find it useful to demonstrate the results by a number of different formalisms .",
    "we first generalize the arguments by ginzburg and frank to prove dissipation effects associated with the relative motion of two parallel plates .",
    "we then use the input  output formalism of quantum optics to derive and compute the friction force based on scattering matrices .",
    "an alternative proof follows approaches introduced in the context of quantum field theory in curved space - time , making use of an inner product to identify the wavefunctions and their ( quantum ) character .",
    "application of the latter formalism to vacuum friction is particularly suited to a real dielectric function , and to the best of our knowledge has not been employed in this context before .",
    "finally we employ the rytov formalism  @xcite which is grounded in the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for electrodynamics and well - known to practitioners of non - contact friction .",
    "we thereby extend previous results on friction , and radiation in the gap between the half - spaces to those within their medium , which is desired to establish a connection to the cherenkov radiation .",
    "to ease computations , however , we consider a scalar field theory as a simpler substitute for electromagnetism .",
    "the former shares the same conceptual complexity while being more tractable analytically .",
    "this is particularly useful in expressing complicated green s functions with points both inside and outside each half - space , or within the gap between them .",
    "the generalization to vector and dyadic electromagnetic expressions should be straightforward but laborious . finally to avoid complications of the full lorentz transformations , we limit ourselves to small velocities  both the relative velocity of the objects and the speed of light in their media .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : friction ] , existing formulas are used without proof to compute friction , and to discuss the similarities with the classical cherenkov effect . in this section",
    ", we elaborate on friction in a specific example . in sec .",
    "[ sec : arguments ] , we consider a general setup , argue for and derive the friction force , as well as emitted radiation , in great detail .",
    "this section comprises 4 subsections each devoted to one particular formalism .",
    "specifically , we discuss how the radiation within the half - spaces , and in the gap , depend on the reference frame .",
    "we start with a scalar model that is described by a free field theory in empty space , while inside the medium a `` dielectric '' ( or , a response ) function @xmath0 is assumed which characterizes the object s dispersive properties .",
    "the field equation for this model reads @xmath1 with @xmath2 in the vacuum , and a frequency - dependent constant inside the medium .",
    "we consider the configuration of two parallel half - spaces in @xmath3 spatial dimensions , separated by a vacuum gap of size @xmath4 .",
    "for each half - space in its rest frame , a plane wave of frequency @xmath5 and wavevector @xmath6 is reflected with amplitude ( ` reflection matrix ' ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the component of the wavevector parallel to the surface .",
    "this result is easily obtained by solving the field equations inside and outside the half - space , and matching the reflection amplitude to satisfy the continuity of the field and its first derivative along the boundary .",
    "we are particularly interested in friction at zero temperature which is mediated solely by evanescent waves  @xcite ; for further discussion see ref .",
    "such waves contribute to friction through the imaginary part of the reflection matrices .",
    "if one half - space moves laterally with velocity @xmath9 along the @xmath10 axis , while the other is at rest , the friction force is given by ( introducing the notation @xmath11 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the heaviside step function , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the area .",
    "note that the reflection matrix of the static half - space is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : reflection matrix ] ) , but that of the moving half - space is obtained after lorentz transforming to the lab frame .",
    "we leave the derivation and extension of eq .",
    "( [ eq : friction ] ) to the next section , but discuss its implications here . while this equation has been studied extensively in the literature , it is usually assumed that the dielectric medium is lossy , with a nonzero imaginary part of @xmath0 .",
    "however , even when @xmath16 is vanishingly small , a frictional force can be obtained as follows . with @xmath17",
    ", the medium can be characterized by the modified speed of light @xmath18 .",
    "the only relevant length scale in the problem ( aside from the overall area @xmath15 ) is the separation @xmath4 .",
    "we can then construct the frictional force on purely dimensional grounds as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a function of two dimensionless velocity ratios .",
    "any velocity could have appeared as prefactor ( with a correspondingly modified function @xmath20 ) ; we have chosen @xmath21 for convenience .",
    "for small velocities , the dependence on vacuum light velocity @xmath22 drops out ) . ] , and @xmath23 with @xmath24 depending only on the ratio of the velocity @xmath9 to the light speed in the medium @xmath21 .",
    "interestingly , at small @xmath9 , only the modified speed within the media is relevant .",
    "our assumption pertains to the non - retarded limit when the speed of light can be formally taken to @xmath25 .",
    "barton has also considered the same limit in ref .",
    "@xcite where he computes the frictional ( drag ) force between weakly dissipative media described by the _ drude model _ , hence obtaining different power laws in the limit of zero temperature .",
    "now note that the heaviside function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : friction ] ) restricts to frequencies @xmath26 furthermore , the imaginary part of the reflection matrix @xmath27 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : reflection matrix ] ) , is only nonzero when @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which , in turn , imply @xmath30 a similar condition holds for the second half - space : @xmath31 with primed values defined in the moving reference - frame . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that @xmath32 , and thus neglect the complications of a full lorentz transformation .",
    "hence , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then the analog of eq .",
    "( [ eq : first plate ] ) for the second half - space reads @xmath35     through the function @xmath24 . below a certain velocity , @xmath36 ,",
    "the friction force is zero ; it starts to rise linearly at @xmath37 , achieves a maximum and then falls off.,width=453 ]    the above conditions limit the range of integration to @xmath38 one then finds the minimum velocity where a frictional force arises as @xmath39 this threshold velocity is reminiscent of the classical cherenkov effect , although larger by a factor of two .",
    "however , in the _ center - of - mass _ frame where the two half - spaces move at the same velocity but in opposite directions , we find the same condition as that of the cherenkov effect : a frictional force arises when , in the center - of - mass frame , the half - spaces velocity exceeds that of light in the medium . as a specific example , we consider a two dimensional space , i.e. surfaces represented by straight lines .",
    "the dependence of the friction force on relative velocity is then plotted in fig .  [",
    "plot : cherenkov ] .",
    "in the previous section we argued for the appearance of friction between moving parallel plates which is reminiscent of the cherenkov effect . establishing a complete correspondence requires a full analysis of the radiation within each object . in this section ,",
    "we provide several arguments to demonstrate why and how a fluctuation - induced friction arises in the context of macroscopic objects in relative motion .",
    "our presentation is not a repetition of the existing literature : friction , as well as radiation within the gap , are obtained through novel methodologies , and further extended to compute radiation inside the media .",
    "we start with a heuristic argument , making a connection with the frank - ginzburg condition .",
    "we then present three distinct derivations of the friction force using techniques developed in different fields : the first method relies on the input - output formalism in a second - quantized picture ; the second one appeals to quantum field theory in curved space - time .",
    "the last two approaches are , to the best of our knowledge , novel in their application to quantum friction between moving half - spaces .",
    "the last , and the longest , derivation is based on fluctuation - dissipation theorem , or the closely related rytov formalism .",
    "the advantage of the latter approach is in finding correlation functions inside and outside the two half - spaces which can be used to compute the radiation within each half - space and in the gap between them .      to start with ,",
    "let us consider a space - filling dielectric medium described by a constant real @xmath0 .",
    "a wave described by wavevector @xmath6 satisfies the dispersion relation @xmath40 , with @xmath18 being the speed of light in the medium .",
    "this relation describes the spectrum of quantum field excitations .",
    "if the medium is set in motion , the new spectrum can be deduced simply by a lorentz transformation from the static to the moving frame .",
    "assuming again that the speed of light in medium is small ( or @xmath0 is large ) , we find @xmath41 with the medium moving with speed @xmath9 parallel to the @xmath10 axis .    ) , and a moving medium ( dashed curve denoted by @xmath42 ) , in the @xmath43 plane .",
    "the spectrum for the moving medium is merely tilted .",
    "the production of a pair of excitations , indicated by solid circles at opposite momenta , is energetically possible for @xmath44.,width=491 ]    next consider two ( semi - infinite ) media one of which moves laterally with velocity @xmath9 , whereas the other is at rest .",
    "although the boundaries modify the dispersion relation , we may assume that eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) _ approximately _ describes each medium ( with @xmath45 for the stationary body ) .",
    "this is justified by considering wavepackets away from boundaries .",
    "we thus have two distinct spectra : the spectrum for the half - space at rest is akin to a cone while that of the moving half - space is _ tilted _ towards the positive @xmath10 axis , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] . for the sake of simplicity , we limit ourselves to @xmath46 .",
    "let us consider the ( spontaneous ) production of two particles , one in each medium .",
    "since linear momentum is conserved the two particles must have opposite momenta ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "this process is energetically favored if the sum of the energy of the two particles is negative , that is , spontaneous pair production occurs if it lowers the energy of the composite system .",
    "this condition is satisfied when @xmath49 which is possible only if @xmath50 .",
    "we stress that our argument is not specific to a particular reference frame . if both half - spaces are moving with velocities @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the velocity @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energetics ] ) is replaced by @xmath53 , thus this equation puts a bound on the relative velocity .",
    "the above argument is similar to the landau criterion for obtaining the critical velocity of a superfluid flowing past a wall  @xcite .",
    "the instability of the quantum state against spontaneous production of elementary excitations ( and vortices ) breaks the superfluid order beyond a certain velocity .",
    "quantum friction provides a close analog to landau s argument in the context of macroscopic bodies .",
    "the same line of reasoning is adopted in the work of frank and ginzburg  @xcite . while this argument correctly predicts the threshold velocity for the onset of friction , it does not quantify the magnitude of friction and its dependence on system parameters .",
    "the input - output formalism deals with the second quantized operators corresponding to incoming and outgoing wave functions , relating them through the classical scattering matrix @xcite . from the ( known ) distribution of the incoming modes , one can then determine the out - flux of the outgoing quanta .",
    "the input - output formalism has been used to study the _ dynamical casimir effect_a consequence of the quantum field theory in the presence of moving boundaries @xcite  in theoretical @xcite as well as experimental @xcite contexts , and recently generalized in application to lossy objects by utilizing scattering techniques  @xcite . the present generalization to half - spaces in relative motion relies on our assumption that the dielectric function is approximately a real constant . in this context , we consider incoming waves as originated well within each half - space , far away from the gap between them ( asymptotic infinity ) .",
    "these waves propagate towards the gap , and then scatter ( backwards or forwards ) to asymptotic infinities .",
    "the incoming and outgoing wave - functions for each half - space are normalized such that the current density perpendicular to the surface of the half - space is unity up to a sign .",
    "the second - quantized field @xmath54 within the medium is indexed by @xmath55 designating the two objects .",
    "this operator is decomposed into modes defined by operators @xmath56 separately for incoming and outgoing waves within each half - space . note that an operator @xmath57 with negative @xmath5 should be interpreted as a creation operator ; more precisely , @xmath58 ( the momentum s sign is reversed due to hermitian conjugation ) . crudely speaking , annihilating a negative - energy particle is equivalent to creating one with positive energy .",
    "the operator @xmath59 ( with the index @xmath60 being implicit ) is expanded as @xmath61 with two copies of this equation , one for each half - space .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath62 , in the object s rest frame , is defined as @xmath63 with the prefactor being chosen to ensure the normalization , @xmath64 measuring the distance from the surface , and @xmath65 . note that the designation of incoming or outgoing for propagating waves depends on the relative signs of @xmath5 and @xmath66 , as indicated in the above equation . for the moving half - space ,",
    "the corresponding wavefunctions are obtained by a lorentz transformation of @xmath5 and @xmath47 , while @xmath66 ( being perpendicular to the velocity ) remains invariant .    with the operators defined above",
    ", the input - output relation takes the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the @xmath69 scattering matrix , and the dependence on @xmath5 and @xmath8 is implicit .",
    "the scattering matrix can be straightforwardly computed by matching the wavefunction and its first derivatives along the boundaries .",
    "note that a scattering channel relates a wavefunction labeled by @xmath70 on one half - space to @xmath71 , the frequency and wavevector as seen from the moving frame , on the second half - space . at small velocities , we have @xmath33 and @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , a positive - frequency mode on one half - space can be coupled to a mode with negative frequency on the other half - space . however , as remarked above , an operator @xmath57 with negative @xmath5 is , in fact , a creation operator .",
    "this mixing between positive and negative frequencies is at the heart of the dynamical casimir effect  @xcite . in a frequency window where this mixing occurs , i.e. for @xmath73",
    ", the input - output relation is recast as @xmath74 one can then compute the expected flux of the outgoing modes , @xmath75 . at zero temperature , @xmath76 , and the only contribution to the outflux",
    "is due to the second term in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixing ] ) , resulting in @xmath77 with @xmath13 being the heaviside step function . the friction , or the rate of the lateral momentum transfer from one half - space to another ,",
    "is then @xmath78 similarly , the energy radiation can be computed by replacing @xmath79 by @xmath80 in the last equation .",
    "it is a simple exercise to compute the scattering matrix : exploiting the continuity equations ( of the field and its first derivative ) at the interface of the two half - spaces and the gap , we find the set of equations @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath66 are defined above , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 and @xmath85 are appropriate coefficients to be determined .",
    "notice that the waves in the medium are propagating while those within the gap are evanescent , consistent with the constraints outlined above .",
    "one can then solve for @xmath86 explicitly , and , using eqs .",

    "indeed the input - output formalism makes the derivation rather trivial .",

    "the above canonical relations applied to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixing ] ) yield @xmath93 implying that the scattering amplitude corresponding to the backscattering in the first medium is larger than unity for @xmath94 .",
    "this is an example of the so - called _ superscattering _ due to zeldovich  @xcite : for certain modes , a moving ( rotating ) object amplifies incoming waves indicating that energy is extracted from motion .",
    "a closely related phenomenon occurs for rotating black holes and is known as the penrose process  @xcite .",
    "superradiance signals quantum instability of the moving object resulting in energy and momentum radiation , and a corresponding exertion of frictional force  @xcite . equations  ( [ eq : l mom rad ] ) and ( [ eq : super unitary ] )",
    "can be combined to yield @xmath95 this expression is indeed very similar to quantum radiation from a rotating object ( a rotating black hole in ref .",
    "@xcite or a rotating cylinder in ref .",
    "@xcite ) with the following substitutions : @xmath96 ( linear to angular velocity ) , @xmath97 ( linear to angular momentum ) , and @xmath98 to be replaced by the scattering matrix of the rotating body .",
    "it is worth noting that the only contribution to the radiation is from modes with @xmath99 , corresponding to evanescent waves in the gap between the two half - spaces . in this respect ,",
    "the radiation is a quantum tunneling process across a barrier ( in this case , the gap ) .",
    "we can recast the wave equation in a fashion similar to the schringer equation as @xmath100 with @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : input - output ] .",
    "the relative motion of the two media results in a steady tunneling of particles of opposite momenta from one half - space to another , thus leading to the slowdown of the motion .      in this section ,",
    "we describe a method which is widely used in application to quantum field theory in curved space - time , or in the presence of moving bodies . however , the following discussion is , to the best of our knowledge , the first application of this method to the problem of moving half - spaces , which is possible only when the dielectric function is taken to be a real constant .    to quantize a field theory ,",
    "a first step is to decompose the quadratic part of the hamiltonian into a collection of ( infinite ) harmonic oscillators ; define the corresponding annihilation and creation operators , and impose canonical commutation relations .",
    "one can then construct the fock space with the vacuum state of no particles , and excited single- and multi - particle states obtained by applying creation operators .",
    "in high energy physics , the usual starting point is empty space , but the above procedure works equally well in the presence of background matter , as is the case for the casimir effect .",
    "the reason is that canonical quantization only relies upon time translation and time reversal symmetry .",
    "the former allows construction of eigenmodes of a definite frequency , which is the basis of the notion of modes / quanta / particles .",
    "time reversal symmetry , on the other hand , is used to identify creation and annihilation operators : the coefficient of a positive ( negative ) frequency mode is understood as an annihilation ( creation ) operator . to make this correspondence explicit ,",
    "consider a quantum field @xmath104 , possibly in the presence of a background _ medium _ which is static .",
    "one can find a basis of eigenmodes @xmath105 labeled by frequency @xmath5 and quantum number @xmath106 to expand the field as @xmath107 with ( defining @xmath108 ) @xmath109=\\ddelta(\\omega_1-\\omega_2)\\ , \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\,.\\ ] ] the latter follows from the canonical commutation relations between the field @xmath110 and its conjugate momentum @xmath111 , @xmath112=i \\hbar \\ , \\delta({{\\mathbf x}}-{{\\mathbf y}}).\\ ] ]    when the object is moving , we lose one or both symmetries in time .",
    "the case of two parallel plates in lateral motion respects time translation symmetry as the relative position does not change .",
    "time reversal symmetry , on the other hand , is broken ; in the backward direction of time the half - space moves in the opposite direction . in the absence of time reversal symmetry , the correspondence between positive ( negative ) frequency and the annihilation ( creation ) operators breaks down .",
    "there is , however , a more general way to identify operators as follows .",
    "let us consider two functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which are solutions to the classical field equation , and define an inner product as  @xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the corresponding conjugate momentum , and the integral is over the whole space .",
    "one can easily see that the inner product defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inner product ] ) is independent of the choice of the reference frame or the ( space - like ) hypersurface as the integration domain .",
    "furthermore , we can always find a set of functions @xmath117 which solve the classical field equation and form an orthonormal basis , @xmath118 while their conjugate modes are orthonormal up to a negative sign , @xmath119 note that @xmath5 is still a good quantum number because of the translation symmetry in time .",
    "these modes form a complete basis , such that the field @xmath120 can be expanded as @xmath121 therefore , an annihilation ( creation ) mode should be more generally identified with a positive ( negative ) norm and not frequency ; the latter depends on the reference frame while the former does not .",
    "the above relations become obvious for a field theory in a static background where the conjugate momentum is proportional to @xmath122 ; eq .",

    "the inner - product method is used in application to quantum field theory in curved space - time .",
    "for example , it has been employed to show that a rotating black hole is unstable due to spontaneous emission  @xcite . for two parallel plates in motion ,",
    "we first introduce a complete basis . due to the translation symmetry in time and space ( parallel to the half - spaces surface )",
    ", wavefunctions can be labelled by frequency @xmath5 and tangential wavevector @xmath8 defined in the lab frame where the first half - space is at rest and the second one is moving .",
    "there are two independent solutions defined as @xmath123 and @xmath124 the incoming and outgoing functions are defined in eq .",

    "one can then see that @xmath131 and @xmath132 to obtain these relations , we have exploited the fact that the norms are diagonal in frequency to compute the delta functions in @xmath66 from eqs .",

    "( [ eq : super unitary ] ) is essential in deriving the norms .",
    "functions of type i have positive norm so they serve as the coefficients of annihilation operators .",
    "however , type ii functions include negative - norm modes for @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , despite the positive sign of frequency , the latter should be identified as creation operators .",
    "we thus expand the field as @xmath134 where the summation is a shorthand for multiple integrals , and @xmath135 and @xmath136 satisfy the usual commutation relations .",
