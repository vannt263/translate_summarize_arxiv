    ", the pseudo potential shows a non - monotonic behavior with respect to chemical potential in the small @xmath76 region , but not in the large @xmath76 region ( see figure  ) .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior might be related to the one in the entanglement entropy .    in this paper , we just reported the behaviors of the entanglement entropy and heavy quark potential in the holographic stckelberg insulator / superconductor model",
    ". unfortunately , due to the lack of the knowledge of the dual field theory in the  bottom - up \" approach , we can not completely understand some implications of the behaviors of entanglement entropy and heavy quark potential , in particular , for the non - monotonic behavior , although we tried to give some discussions for this in ref .",
