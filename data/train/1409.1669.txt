    "furthermore , light scalar fields acquire fluctuations during inflation and can generate adiabatic and almost scale - invariant density perturbations which are in good agreement with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations  @xcite . in the simplest case , a scalar field which causes inflation ( called an inflaton ) is responsible for the density perturbations , but it is also possible that another scalar field gives a significant contribution to the density perturbations . in particular , in curvaton models  @xcite some scalar field besides the inflaton ( called a curvaton ) obtains fluctuations during inflation and decays into radiation to produce adiabatic perturbations after reheating due to the inflaton decay .",
    "however , in general , curvaton models produce not only adiabatic perturbations but also isocurvature ones .",
    "isocurvature perturbations @xmath5 are defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the energy density , its fluctuation and the coefficient of the equation of state of a component @xmath10 . for example , if cold dark matter ( cdm ) ( or baryon number ) is generated and decouples from thermal bath before the curvaton decays , the isocurvature perturbations between cdm ( baryon ) and radiation are given by @xmath11 , neglecting inflaton fluctuations .",
    "moreover , the isocuravature perturbations produced in this way are anti - correlated with curvature perturbations @xmath12 as @xmath13 . on the other hand , we have positively correlated isocurvature perturbations if cdm ( baryon ) is produced from the curvaton decay . in either case , since the isocurvature fluctuations are stringently constrained by cmb observations , they cause a serious cosmological difficulty in curvaton models .    an obvious solution to the isocurvature problem",
    "is to produce both cdm and baryon number thermally after the curvaton decays .",
    "another interesting possibility is that cdm is produced from the inflaton and the baryon number is generated from the curvaton decay , or vice versa .",
    "then , the total matter isocurvature perturbations @xmath14 are written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the density parameters of cdm , baryon and matter ( @xmath19 ) , respectively . in this case",
    ", the contributions from cdm and baryon can cancel each other and hence we can avoid the stringent constraint from the cmb because the temperature anisotropies are produced only through @xmath14 ( and @xmath12 ) .",
    "when the cancellation occurs and @xmath14 is significantly reduced in comparison with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , it is said that cdm and baryonic isocurvature perturbations are `` compensated '' with each other  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the isocurvature perturbations can be anti - correlated with the adiabatic ones , temperature anisotropies on large scales can be reduced .",
    "in fact , the large scale temperature anisotropies by the sachs - wolfe effect is approximately given by  @xcite @xmath22 ,     \\label{eq : temp_aniso}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the power spectra of curvature and isocurvature perturbations , and @xmath25 is the cross power spectrum of them .",

    "( [ eq : temp_aniso ] ) , it is seen that @xmath27 decreases compared with a pure adiabatic case if @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , when the tensor mode exits , the isocurvature perturbations can compensate for its effect on @xmath27 .",
    "this effect may solve the tension between the planck observation of the temperature fluctuations  @xcite and the bicep2 detection of the b - mode polarization  @xcite as pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "although it is premature to conclude the b - mode detection , taking into account uncertainty of the foreground dust emission  @xcite , need for reducing temperature fluctuations on large scales is also suggested from the analysis by  @xcite , which shows that a negative tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath29 gives a better fit to the planck data .",
    "the compensated isocurvature perturbations can not only avoid the stringent cmb constraint but also have a possibility to improve agreement with the observational data .",
    "in this paper we study a curvaton model where both cdm and baryonic isocurvature perturbations are produced .",
    "we identify the curvaton as a right - handed sneutrino in supersymmetric ( susy ) theories . in this model baryon asymmetry",
    "is generated via non - thermal leptogenesis by decay of sneutrinos into left - handed ( s)leptons and higgs(inos ) .",
    "on the other hand , gravitinos produced during reheating after inflation can be dark matter if they are the lightest susy particles ( lsps ) .",
    "if not , lsps produced by the gravitino decay account for dark matter .",
    "then , baryon and cdm(@xmath30lsps ) have correlated and anti - correlated isocurvature perturbations , respectively , and they compensate for each other by taking appropriate model parameters .",
    "the possibility of such compensated isocurvature perturbations in a sneutrino curvaton model was pointed out in  @xcite but a detailed analysis has not been performed .",
    "we estimate the baryon number and the dark matter density as well as amplitudes of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations in the sneutrino curvaton model .",

    "[ sec : s_m=0 ] , the curvaton model might generate large primordial non - gaussianity , @xmath162 .",
    "the parameter region we consider , however , corresponds to the case with @xmath169 and hence our model is consistent with the planck result .",
    "as we have shown , our model realizes the isocurvature perturbations which compensate for the tensor modes and reduce the temperature fluctuations on large scales , which can solve the possible tension between the planck observation of the temperature fluctuations  @xcite and the bicep2 detection of the b - mode polarization  @xcite , as pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "we also note that a negative tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath191 may give a better fit to the planck data  @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp_aniso2 ] ) , we can realize such a situation when the following relation is satisfied for @xmath192 , @xmath193 where @xmath194 is an effective tensor - to - scalar ratio .",

    "we plot the condition to realize the negative tensor - to - scalar ratio for each value of @xmath194 in fig  [ fig : negative_tensor ] , where we assume @xmath190 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the sneturino curvaton model in which the cdm / baryon isocurvature perturbations are generated .",
    "we have considered cases where the isocurvature perturbations compensate each other or compensate for the tensor contributions to the temperature anisotropies , which could improve agreement between observations . in our curvaton scenario ,",
    "the non - thermal leptogenesis from the sneutrino curvaton is responsible for the baryon asymmetry and gravitinos produced during the reheating or their decay products account for dark matter .",
    "we have found that the compensation requires the curvaton field value during inflation of @xmath195  gev , the reheating temperature @xmath147 of @xmath31  gev and the curvaton decay temperature @xmath174 of @xmath196  gev .",
    "finally , let us comment on mass spectra of susy particles , based on the constraint from the bbn  @xcite .",
    "when the gravitino is the lsp , the gravitino mass is of @xmath32  tev .",
    "decay of the next - to lsp ( nlsp ) might destroy the success of the bbn .",

    ".    on the other hand , when the lsp is not the gravitino , the gravitino may be far heavier than the lsp .",
    "if the gravitino mass is larger than @xmath197  tev , the constraint from the bbn is avoided . to obtain the observed dark matter density ,",
    "@xmath198  tev@xmath199 is required .",
