    "in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions , after initial collisions , the parton system will be dominated by gluons @xcite .",

    "a calculable cross section in high energy hadronic collisions is factorized into a single collision between two partons multiplied by a probability to find these two partons of momentum fractions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , from two incoming hadrons .",
    "the probability is then factorized into a product of two parton distributions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are probabilities to find these two partons from the respective hadrons @xcite . because of extremely large number of soft gluons in heavy ion beams , it is natural to go beyond the factorized single - scattering formalism to include any possible multiple scattering , and long range correlations between soft gluons from two incoming ions .",
    "mclerran and venugopalan ( mv ) developed a new formalism for calculation of the soft gluon distribution for very large nuclei @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the valence quarks in the nuclei are treated as the classical source of the color charges .",
    "they argued that the valence quark recoil can be ignored in the limit when the gluons emitted are soft .",
    "in addition , because of the lorentz contraction , the color charge of the valence quarks is treated approximately as an infinitely thin sheet of color charge along the light cone . with these assumptions ,",
    "the gluon distribution function for very large nuclei may be obtained by solving the classical yang - mills equation @xcite . using the classical glue field generated by a single nucleus obtained in the mv formalism as the basic input , kovner , mclerran , and weigert ( kmw ) computed the soft gluon production in a collision of two ultra - relativistic heavy nuclei by solving the classical yang - mills equations with the iteration to the second order @xcite .",
