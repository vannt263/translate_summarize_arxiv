    "one of the most pressing problems in string theory is the issue of moduli fixing .",
    "there is great arbitrariness in the compactification of the theory to four dimensions , usually parametrized in terms of a broad moduli space . for trivial supergravity backgrounds ,",
    "the scalar potential in the moduli space remains flat and the low energy spectrum has plenty of massless scalars .",
    "however , if superstring theory pretends to be a unified theory of all particles and interactions , it should provide us with a mechanism which lifts these scalars from the low energy spectrum .",
    "recently there has been remarkable progress by considering the possibility of having diluted backgrounds of the rr and nsns forms @xcite . from the effective supergravity perspective , these induce non - trivial superpotentials which stabilize some ( or even all ) of the original moduli so they become massive . most of the work up to now has been done in the context of type iib string theory with three form fluxes . in that case , the minima of the superpotentials are associated to warped solutions of type iib supergravity @xcite and the backreaction of the fluxes represents a conformal deformation of the calabi yau metric .",
    "thus , one can fairly consider the moduli space in the presence of diluted fluxes as a smooth deformation of the original one .",
    "unfortunately , all of these models correspond to no - scale solutions on which the khler moduli have to be stabilized through some alternative mechanism , such as non - perturbative effects which are always difficult to deal with .",
    "moreover , at the minimum of the scalar potential , the fluxes contribute to the rr tadpoles with the same sign as d3-branes do and one usually is enforced to take manifolds with large euler numbers in order to fulfill the tadpole conditions and at the same time stabilize the moduli at large values where the @xmath1 and @xmath2 corrections are under control .    in the last couple of years",
    "analogous setups have been considered in the context of type iia string theory @xcite-@xcite . in that case",
    ", one can switch on fluxes in both the even and the odd dimensional cycles of the internal manifold so the induced superpotential in principle depends on both the complex structure and the khler moduli .",
    "although the ten dimensional supergravity description of this kind of vacua is not always well understood , in the limit of diluted fluxes the scale of the masses induced by the fluxes is much smaller than the kaluza - klein scale and thus to consider the moduli space of the fluxed manifold as a smooth deformation of the original space still seems to be a fairly good approximation .",
    "the particular case of @xmath0 orientifolds has been recently analyzed in @xcite . in that case",
    ", the orientifold projection allows in addition for some set of metric fluxes corresponding to the gauging of some of the original isometries of the torus @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this renders the manifold into a twisted torus with reduced homology .",
    "this kind of geometric deformations very often survive to the action of an orbifold group , even though this kills all the original isometries , so one expects to have similar deformations in more generic half - flat manifolds .",
    "type iia compactifications with fluxes and torsion have revealed to possess several interesting properties for model building .",
    "first of all , the fluxes can contribute to the tadpoles with any sign or even not contribute .",
    "this gives additional freedom for cancelling the rr tadpoles in semirealistic models .",
    "in addition , one can find ads vacua with all the closed string moduli stabilized and on which the supersymmetry on the branes is enforced by the background fluxes .    here",
    "we will briefly overview some of the features found in @xcite for type iia @xmath0 orientifolds in presence of fluxes .",
    "thus , in section 2 we will review the moduli space of type iia toroidal orientifolds and the possibility of having metric fluxes . in section 3 the vacuum structure of the scalar potentials induced by the fluxes will be discussed .",
    "section 4 will be devoted to the consistency conditions of stacks of intersecting d6-branes in these vacua .",
    "finally , a concrete example of @xmath3 mssm - like vacua with all the moduli stabilized in ads will be presented in section 5 and some last comments will be made in section 6 .",
    "we will concentrate in the case of type iia compactified to four dimensions in a simple @xmath4 orientifold , where @xmath5 is the world - sheet parity operator , @xmath6 is the space - time fermionic number for the left - movers and @xmath7 is an order two involution of the 6-torus acting in the khler 2-form and in the holomorphic 3-form respectively as @xmath8    moreover , we will assume the 6-torus to be factorized",
    ". then , a suitable cohomology basis will be given by a set of 3-forms @xmath9 with @xmath10 , a set of @xmath7-odd ( 1,1)-forms @xmath11 and its poincar dual set of @xmath7-even ( 2,2)-forms @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "the 3-forms @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are taken in such a way that are even ( odd ) under the orientifold involution and @xmath16 .",
    "the fixed point of @xmath7 corresponds to @xmath17 $ ] and it is the locus of 16 o6-planes .    it has been shown @xcite that the moduli space for this kind of orientifold compactifications is better described in terms of the complexified forms @xmath18 with @xmath19 the nsns 2-form , @xmath20 the rr 3-form and @xmath21 a compensator field specified by @xmath22\\ ] ]    the moduli parameters then can be obtained by expanding the above forms in the corresponding cohomology basis @xmath23 here @xmath24 parametrize the possible khler deformations of the torus whereas @xmath25 with @xmath26 correspond to complex structure deformations .",
    "@xmath27 is the usual moduli for the dilaton .",
    "one can define then a metric in the moduli space through the khler potential @xmath28- \\textrm{log}~\\sqrt{\\textrm{vol($t^6$)}}e^{-\\phi}\\ ] ] which in terms of the above moduli parameters takes the standard logarithmic form for toroidal compactifications @xmath29    as advanced in the introduction , for type iia compactifications the orientifold projection may allow in addition for some geometric deformations of the original manifold which render it into a half - flat manifold . in particular , one can introduce a set of metric fluxes @xmath30 in the torus @xmath31 so the tangent 1-forms @xmath32 are no longer closed forms @xmath33 due to this , some of the original cycles of the torus will disappear from the homology in the presence of metric fluxes .",
    "we will consider here the most general set of metric fluxes compatible with the symmetry of a factorable @xmath34 and the orientifold projection .",
    "this is given by @xmath35    it has been shown ( see e.g. @xcite ) that toroidal compactifications with metric fluxes are equivalent to compactification on a twisted torus , on which some of the isometries @xmath36 of the original torus have been gauged .",
    "then , for consistency of the twisted torus structure @xcite , the metric fluxes in general will be quantized and the @xmath37 and @xmath38 parameters will only take integer values .",
    "this could be in part expected , since some of the metric fluxes are related to type iib nsns fluxes by t - duality @xcite .    on the other hand , either from the jacobi identity of the algebra engendered by the isometries or from the bianchi identity of eq.([metri ] )",
    ", one finds that the metric fluxes must satisfy @xmath39p}=0 \\label{jacobi}\\ ] ]    this constrains the set of metric fluxes which one can switch on @xcite .",
    "however this is automatically satisfied by the set of metric fluxes allowed by the orientifold projection . ] .",
    "concretely , one has @xmath40    we would like now to consider the addition of non - trivial background fluxes for the type iia nsns and rr forms .",
    "this will be done in the following section .",
    "it has been shown by applying gauged supergravity techniques @xcite-@xcite or directly by dimensional reduction of the ten dimensional supergravity action @xcite-@xcite that , from the point of view of the four dimensional @xmath3 effective theory , a background for the nsns and the rr type iia field strengths induces a non trivial superpotential of the form @xmath41 \\label{super}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 represents a formal sum over the rr fluxes .",
    "we will consider therefore a general background of the nsns 3-form and the even rank rr forms and we will expand it in the cohomology basis of the factorized torus @xmath43    since the fluxes are quantized over the corresponding @xmath44-cycles , the coefficients of this expansion will be integer values .",
    "moreover , we will assume the field strengths to have dimensions of @xmath45 so the moduli fields will be dimensionless .",
    "plugging this into eq.([super ] ) , one can easily check that the superpotential is a cubic polynomial of the moduli @xmath46",
    "\\nonumber \\\\[0.2 cm ] & - q_1 t_2 t_3 -q_2 t_1 t_3 -q_3 t_1 t_2 + i m t_1 t_2 t_3\\label{s2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in addition , the fluxes in general will contribute to the rr tadpoles @xcite .",
    "the relevant piece of the ten dimensional action is given by @xmath47 + \\sum_a n_a \\int_{m_4 \\times \\pi_a } c_7 \\label{tadpol1}\\ ] ] where we are considering the possibility of having stacks of @xmath48 d6-branes wrapping factorized 3-cycles @xmath49    plugging our background into ( [ tadpol1 ] ) then gives rise to the following tadpole cancellation conditions @xmath50    note that since the metric fluxes modify the homology of the original torus , in principle not every 3-cycle @xmath51 will be a consistent cycle on which to wrap the d6-branes .",
    "considerations about consistency for d6-branes in presence of metric fluxes will be made in section 4 .",
    "the vacuum structure of the scalar potential induced by ( [ kahler ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) has been analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "there , one can see how the fluxes induce a broad landscape of vacua consisting of both minkowski and ads vacua with broken or unbroken supersymmetry . here",
    "we will briefly summarize some of the main results .      for the particular case of supersymmetric minkowski vacua it was found in @xcite that it is required the presence of metric fluxes and @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , generically one finds a large number of flat directions , being able to fix at most three linear combinations of complex moduli .",
    "the fluxes contribute to the rr tadpoles with the same sign as d6-branes do , or do not contribute .",
    "this last possibility represents a novelty with respect to the gukov - vafa - witten scenarios , where the fluxes always contributed positively to the rr tadpoles .      as no - scale",
    "we distinguish models in which the superpotential is independent of three of the moduli , so the explicit form of the khler potential ( [ kahler ] ) guarantees a cancellation of the cosmological constant at tree - level , even though supersymmetry is broken @xcite .",
    "these minima has very similar properties to the ones found for the minkowski models .",
    "in particular , again there is a large number of moduli which remain unstabilized and the fluxes always contribute to the rr tadpoles as d6-branes .",
    "this kind of vacua posses a different qualitative behavior than the minkowski ones . in particular , generically all the moduli are stabilized but some linear combinations of complex structure axions . as it will be shown along next section , this is actually required for consistency with the presence of d6-branes",
    ". moreover , in the cases with non vanishing metric fluxes , one has examples on which the fluxes do not contribute to the rr tadpoles or contribute with the same sign as the orientifold planes do .",
    "this provides us with new possibilities for model building .",
    "in particular , in section 5 we will see a concrete example on which the tadpole contributions of the setup of branes are cancelled by the effect of the fluxes , without the aid of an extra orbifold twist .",
    "since the inclusion of metric fluxes modifies the homology , there will be 3-cycles of the original torus which are no longer closed in the presence of metric fluxes . in this section",
    "we will see how there can appear inconsistencies in the low energy effective action when wrapping d6-branes on these submanifolds .",
    "in fact , the gauge fields living in the worldvolume of a stack of d6-branes couple to the closed string axions through the following piece of the action @xmath53\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the poincar dual in 4d to @xmath55 and the coefficients @xmath56 are given in terms of the wrapping numbers as @xmath57    these couplings have revealed to play an important role in the cancellation of mixed @xmath58 gauge anomalies through diagrams on which the gauge bosons exchange complex structure ( and dilaton ) axions @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the scalars @xmath59 behave as goldstone bosons , giving stckelberg masses to the corresponding @xmath58 s and transforming with a shift under the gauge transformations .",
    "we have seen however that the nsns and metric fluxes induce terms in the superpotential which are linear in i m @xmath60 and therefore generically do not respect these transformation properties .",
    "thus , in order to restore consistency and gauge invariance one has to impose the following condition on the 3-cycle @xmath51 which the brane is wrapping @xmath61 in this way , the linear combinations of axions which become massive due to the green - schwarz mechanism will be orthogonal to the ones which become massive due to the effect of the fluxes .",
    "this constraint actually constitutes the generalization of the freed - witten anomaly cancellation condition to the case of a twisted torus and in fact , when @xmath62 , one recovers the usual constraint for an ordinary torus .",
    "given a background for the nsns 3-form and metric fluxes , the condition ( [ consisten ] ) will determine what are the 3-cycles on which it is consistent to wrap the stacks of d6-branes .",
    "in the particular case of ads vacua , this imposes @xmath51 to be a special lagrangian cycle , so for this kind of models the closed string background restricts the brane content to supersymmetric configurations of d6-branes ( i.e. with all fayet - iliopoulos terms vanishing ) @xcite .",
    "as an illustration of all the above ideas , we will reproduce here a particular example of @xmath3 mssm - like vacua with all the closed string moduli stabilized in ads , which was already presented in @xcite .",
    "we will consider a general isotropic background of nsns , rr and metric fluxes given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 so there is just one overall khler moduli @xmath65 and the superpotential reduces to @xmath66 this choice of metric fluxes automatically satisfies ( [ constra ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the supersymmetric ads minima of the induced scalar potential",
    ". these can be obtained by imposing the vanishing of all the f - terms , i.e. @xmath67 , but @xmath68 . with this one",
    "gets that all the real parts of the moduli are fixed in terms of the fluxes @xmath69 where @xmath70 is determined by the following cubic equation @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    concerning the imaginary parts",
    ", the reader can check that the khler axions are completely fixed by the fluxes whereas only a linear combination of complex structure and dilaton axions is stabilized @xmath73    additionally , the following constraint is required in order to stabilize the real parts of the moduli at positive values @xmath74    let us concentrate now in the particular case of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which automatically satisfies eq.([otra ] ) . the reader can check that choosing the fluxes in such a way the tadpole conditions read @xmath79    moreover , for large values of @xmath80 one has that the four dimensional dilaton scales as @xmath81 , the ten dimensional one as @xmath82 and the flux density as @xmath83 .",
    "thus , taking @xmath84 one may stabilize the moduli at regions where the @xmath1 and @xmath2 corrections are under control and the effective supergravity approach remains valid .",
    "one can add now the following supersymmetric setup of d6-branes @xcite in order to satisfy ( [ tadpo ] )    .a mssm - like model with tadpoles cancelled by fluxes .",
    "branes @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are added in order to cancel the rr tadpoles . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     after separating some of the branes and after two of the @xmath58 s get stckelberg masses , the gauge group becomes @xmath88 $ ] with three generations of quarks and leptons , two doublets of higgsses and extra matter fields involving the auxiliary branes @xmath89 and @xmath87 .",
    "more details about the spectrum can be found in @xcite . in this way",
    ", we have constructed an example of consistent @xmath3 ads vacuum with all the closed string moduli fixed and semi - realistic chiral spectrum .",
    "we have reviewed along the lines of @xcite some of the main properties for the vacua of simple @xmath90 type iia orientifolds with non trivial rr , nsns and metric fluxes .",
    "unlike the type iib case , the richness of the flux options leads to a full stabilization of all closed string moduli in ads without the need of non - perturbative effects .",
    "moreover , one can find vacua on which the flux contribute to the rr tadpoles with the same sign as the o6-planes do or even do not contribute , so there is more freedom to find consistent models with all the moduli stabilized at the perturbative regions of the scalar potential .",
    "an interesting property of these models is that geometric fluxes survive the orientifold projection .",
    "these modify the homology of the original torus and constrains the open string sector . from the point of view of the low energy effective theory , this is reflected in the appearance of possible gauge inconsistencies in the worldvolume of the d6-branes . in the particular case of ads models , this enforces the setup of d6-branes to be supersymmetric .",
    "as an illustration of these ideas , we have presented an example of @xmath3 mssm - like vacua with all the closed string moduli stabilized in ads .    however , still a lot of work has to be done in order to fully understand type iia compactifications with non trivial background fluxes .",
    "this involves the description of the ten dimensional supergravity solutions outside the approach of effective supergravity , the understanding of the geometric deformations beyond the toroidal geometry or the lift of these vacua to ds .",
    "we hope to come back to all these issues in the near future .",
