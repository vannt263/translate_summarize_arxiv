    "the various neutrino oscillation experiments such as those involving solar and atmospheric neutrinos as well as the kek and kamland experiments that involve laboratory produced neutrinos have now produced quite convincing evidence that neutrinos have mass and they mix among themselves .",
    "although the neutrinos have a great deal of similarity with quarks as far as the weak interactions go , the oscillation results have revealed a profound difference i.e. two of the three neutrino mixings are very large whereas all quark mixing angles are very small .",
    "understanding this difference is a major challenge for theoretical particle physics today .",
    "the problem becomes particularly acute in models that unify quarks and leptons such as the so(10 ) grand unified models@xcite , which are considered as prime candidates for describing neutrino masses .",
    "some of the reasons that make so(10 ) models so attractive as grand unification theories of nature are the following : ( i ) in so(10 ) model , all fermions can be part of a single spinor representation ; ( ii ) it contains the left - right symmetric unification group @xmath5@xcite which provides a more satisfactory way to understand the origin of parity violation in nature and ( iii ) finally , perhaps the single most important reason is the natural understanding of small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism@xcite since the single spinor representation discussed above that contains all the standard model fermions also contains the right handed neutrino , needed in implementing the seesaw mechanism .    a closer look at the details of neutrino oscillation data in fact provides one more compelling reason for the so(10 ) model : in order to understand the atmospheric neutrino data , we need the heaviest neutrino mass to be larger than @xmath6 ev . the seesaw formula i.e. @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the neutrino dirac mass and @xmath9 is the mass of the right handed neutrino contributing to the neutrino mass needed to understand the atmospheric data ) then tells us that there must be one right handed @xmath10 gev .",
    "this value is considerably smaller than the planck mass and therefore one is faced with a new hierarchy problem similar to the corresponding problem of the standard model .",
    "however , it was pointed out long ago@xcite that the majorana mass of the rh neutrino owes its origin to the breaking of local b - l symmetry which implies that @xmath11 .",
    "local b - l symmetry therefore provides a natural way to understand the smallness of the rh neutrino mass compared to @xmath12 .",
    "what is very interesting is that so(10 ) group also contains the local b - l as a subgroup .",
    "so(10 ) model , despite its attractiveness for understanding the overall scale of neutrino masses , runs into a potential trouble in providing an understanding of the observed mixings .",
    "the problem arises from the fact that so(10 ) also contains the quark - lepton unification @xmath13 group of pati and salam , which in the simplest approximation leads to equal quark and lepton mixing angles and one needs to make further assumptions to get a handle on the mixings@xcite .",
    "an obvious conceptual problem is that if one of these models is ruled out by data , one would not be able to tell whether it is the so(10 ) unification which is `` at fault '' or it is one of the assumptions used to derive neutrino mixings .",
    "a different approach to this issue was taken in ref.@xcite .",
    "the idea was to avoid the use of any symmetries beyond the gauge symmetry , in this case so(10 ) and use the minimal set of higgs fields that can break the group down to the standard model and give mass to the fermions .",
    "it turns out that if we choose higgs fields in * 10 * and @xmath14 , the yukawa superpotential contains enough parameters to fit the observed fermion masses and mixings of the standard model . it was observed in ref.@xcite , that in this model the neutrino masses and mixings are completely predicted upto an overall scale , when one uses the seesaw mechanism which is part of the so(10 ) model that is in contradiction with observations . ] . to break the gauge symmetry fully",
    ", two additional higgs multiplets belonging to * 45*+*54 * are included .",
    "they do not contribute to the fermion masses , leaving the conclusions on neutrino masses unchanged .",
    "an additional appeal of breaking b - l symmetry of susy so(10 ) by an * 126 * , as opposed to by * 16 * higgs , is that it automatically leaves r - parity as an exact aymmetry and thereby explains , why neutralino is a stable dark matter@xcite .",
    "this is because the submultiplet of * 126 * that breaks b - l carries b - l = 2 . therefore r - parity ( defined by @xmath15 ) quantum number of this field is even and therefore , its vev leaves r - parity unbroken .",
    "in contrast in models where b - l is broken by a * 16 * -plet of higgs , the b - l symmetry is broken by one unit and without any additional symmetries ( e.g. matter parity ) , neutralino is unstable and can not therefore serve as a dark matter . of course , if a fundamental theory e.g. a superstring theory that led to an so(10 ) model with appropriate additional symmetries that guarantee the stability of neutralino was known , then the above objection to an * 16 * higgs would not apply .",
    "the initial analyses of neutrino mixings within the framework of ref.@xcite used the simple seesaw formula ( type i seesaw ) and are now in disagreement with data . in subsequent papers@xcite",
    ", this idea has been analysed ( in some cases by including more than one * 10 * higgses ) to see how close one can come close to the observed neutrino parameters .",
    "the conclusion now appears to be that one needs cp violating phases to achieve this goal , as noted in @xcite .",
    "a way out of this problem is to use the type ii seesaw mechanism , as was initially done in @xcite , where an induced triplet vev is added to the usual type i seesaw formula arising from the rh neutrino intermediate state . in models which have asymptotic parity symmetry such as left - right or so(10 ) models , type ii seesaw arises if both parity and b - l symmetry are broken at the same scale .",
    "a very interesting point about this approach has been noted in a recent paper@xcite , where it has been shown that if we restrict ourselves to the 2 - 3 sector of the model and use the type ii seesaw mechanism , then the @xmath0 unification of supersymmetric grand unified theories leads to a neutrino majorana mass matrix which explains the large @xmath16 mixing angle needed to understand atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "the important point is that no symmetries are needed to get this result .    to see how this result is very generic to so(10 )",
    "models with * 126 * vev , note that : ( i ) in so(10 ) model , the neutrino mass matrix is given by the type ii seesaw formula , with two contributions : one coming from the righthanded neutrino intermediate state and another coming from an induced triplet vev generic to these models , as already mentioned ; and ( ii ) that for certain range of parameters , the induced triplet vev term can dominate the neutrino mass matrix . as was shown in @xcite , under these circumstances",
    ", one gets a sumrule @xmath17 in @xcite , it was observed that since this relation is valid at the seesaw scale , one must use the extrapolated quark and lepton masses in the formula . the fact that at or near the gut scale @xmath18 depending on the value of @xmath19 , implies that the 3 - 3 element of the @xmath20 which is proportional to @xmath21 is of the same order as the off diagonal elements of the @xmath22 in the 2 - 3 subsector leading top the largeness of the atmospheric mixing angle without any further assumptions .",
    "it is however essential to do a complete three generation analysis of this model if this important observation is to lead to a realistic so(10 ) model for understanding all neutrino mixings .",
    "in fact , since the model has no free parameters , it is a priori not obvious that within this framework one would simultaneously get a large solar mixing angle and a small @xmath3 as well as the correct value for the ratio @xmath23 .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to analyze this question .",
    "we find that for a narrow range of the quark masses , the model does indeed lead to the correct mass difference - squares as well as large mixing angles @xmath2 and @xmath1 needed to understand the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations while at the same time keeping @xmath24 as required by the reactor data .",
    "we find that for this entire range , the reactor angle @xmath4 providing a clear way to test the model in the proposed long base line neutrino experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we review the basic equations of the model for the supersymmetric case ; in sec .",
    "iii , we explain the conditions under which the induced triplet vev dominates neutrino masses ; in sec .",
    "iv , we describe our method for solving the equations to predict the neutrino parameters . in sec .",
    "v , we give our results for the neutrino masses and the mixing angles . in sec .",
    "vi , we give our conclusions . in this paper , we ignore the cp violating phases .",
    "we consider supersymmetric so(10 ) group with the higgs fields belonging to the representations * 45*+*54 * for breaking so(10 ) group down to the left - right symmetric group @xmath5 and the minimal higgs set * 10*+*126*+@xmath14 that couple to matter and also break the @xmath25 group down to @xmath26 .",
    "it is the latter set i.e. @xmath27 which is crucial to our discussion of fermion masses .",
    "the first stage of the symmetry breaking therefore could have been accomplished by alternative higgs multiplets e.g. by * 210 * of higgs without effecting our results .",
    "as has been noted earlier@xcite , the set * 10*+@xmath14 which couple to matter contain two pairs of mssm higgs doublets belonging to ( 2,2,1 ) and ( 2,2,15 ) submultiplets ( under @xmath28 subgroup of so(10 ) ) .",
    "we denote the two pairs by @xmath29 and @xmath30 . at the gut scale , by some doublet - triplet splitting mechanism",
    "these two pairs reduce to the mssm higgs pair @xmath31 , which can be expressed in terms of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 as follows : @xmath34 the details of the doublet - triplet splitting mechanism that leads to the above equation are not relevant for what follows and we do not discuss it here . as in the case of mssm , we will assume that the higgs doublets @xmath35 have the vevs @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    in orders to discuss fermion masses in this model ,",
    "we start with the so(10 ) invariant superpotential giving the yukawa couplings of the * 16 * dimensional matter spinor @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 denote generations ) with the higgs fields @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 so(10 ) invariance implies that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are symmetric matrices .",
    "we ignore the small effects coming from the higher dimensional operators . below the b - l breaking ( seesaw ) scale",
    ", we can write the superpotential terms for the charged fermion yukawa couplings as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 in general @xmath47 and this difference is responsible for nonzero ckm mixing angles . in terms of the gut scale yukawa couplings",
    ", one can write the fermion mass matrices at the seesaw scale as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 to count the number of parameters describing the fermion sector , we first ignore cp phases and choose a basis where @xmath50 is diagonal . since @xmath51 is symmetric",
    ", we have a total of nine parameters from the couplings and including @xmath52 and @xmath53 gives us a total of twelve parameters .",
    "all these parameters can be determined by fitting the the six quark masses , three lepton masses and three ckm angles .",
    "this enables a complete determination of the neutrino masses upto an overall scale related to the b - l symmetry breaking and the three mixing angles .",
    "the model is therefore completely predictive in the neutrino sector .    in order to determine the neutrino masses and mixings",
    ", one uses the seesaw mechanism .",
    "as noted in the introduction , most previous works on this model except the works in ref.@xcite used the type one seesaw mechanism where the neutrino mass matrix is given by the formula : @xmath54 where @xmath55 . on the other hand",
    "it is well known that in asymptotically parity conserving theories including so(10 ) , the true seesaw formula@xcite ( called type ii here and in literature ) has a second term which arises from an induced @xmath56 triplet vev or from higher dimensional terms involving left doublets : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the @xmath56 breaking scale and @xmath60 is a combination of parameters in the higgs potential .",
    "the type ii seesaw formula has two new parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 instead of one in the type i case ; but for different ranges of initial parameters in higgs potential , either the first or the second term can be made to dominate@xcite .",
    "we will work within the assumption that it is the first term that dominates the seesaw formula@xcite .",
    "this situation can arise when @xmath63 ( or @xmath60 which is a ratio of scalar coupling parameters is much larger than one ) .",
    "we elaborate the circumstances when this happens in sec .",
    "it was noted in several papers@xcite that if one uses type i seesaw , this model can not produce two large neutrino mixing angles if cp phases are ignored .",
    "it has been shown recently@xcite that once the cp phases are included , one can get bi - large neutrino mixing pattern .",
    "but here we search for two large mixing angle solutions without invoking the cp phase . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "if one uses type ii seesaw and assumes further that the first term dominates , large atmospheric mixing angle follows naturally as a consequence of b-@xmath64 unification . whether this also simultaneously yields a large solar mixing angle and a small @xmath65 remained an open question . in this present paper",
    "we present a detailed analysis of this idea in a full three generation model and show that for a very narrow range of quark masses , this model also predicts large solar mixing angle as well as the correct solar mass splitting together with a small @xmath65 . since the model has hierarchical mass pattern , the atmospheric mass difference - squared is related to the overall scale of the triplet vev in the type ii seesaw formula and can not be predicted .",
    "in this section , we would like to discuss the parameter range where the induced triplet vev term dominates the neutrino mass matrix . to elucidate this",
    "let us discuss the origin of the triplet vev in our minimal so(10 ) model .",
    "first we note the decomposition of the @xmath66 under the group @xmath67 : @xmath68 the @xmath56 triplet that contributes to the type ii seesaw formula is contained in the multiplet @xmath69 and it couples to the left handed multiplet @xmath70 of the * 16 * dimensional so(10 ) spinor that contains the matter fermions i.e. @xmath71 . on the other hand the mass of the rh neutrinos comes from the coupling of @xmath72 submultiplet of @xmath14 to the right handed fermion multiplet @xmath73 i.e. @xmath74 .",
    "the vev of the neutral member of @xmath75 breaks the b - l symmetry and gives mass to the rh neutrinos and generates the second term in the type ii seesaw formula . to see how the @xmath76 vev arises ,",
    "note that the general superpotential of the model contains terms of type @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in the higgs potential",
    ", this generates a term ( from @xmath79 ) of the form @xmath80 . in this term",
    ", there is a term of the form @xmath81 with a coefficient @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , in the higgs potential , there is a mass term for @xmath83 of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the gut scale .",
    "on minimizing the potential , these two terms lead to a vev for the @xmath56 triplet @xmath86 .",
    "it is now clear that if we choose @xmath87 such that @xmath88 , then the entries in the second matrix in the type ii seesaw formula can much smaller than @xmath61 and eq.[key ] holds .",
    "we will work in the domain of the parameter space where this happens .",
    "if the triplet vev contribution to the neutrino mass matrix dominates in the type ii seesaw formula , then equation ( 6 ) can be used to derive the sumrule @xmath89 using this equation in second and third generation sector , one can understand the results of @xcite in a heuristic manner as follows .",
    "the known hierarchical structure of quark and lepton masses as well as the known small mixings for quarks suggest that @xmath90 have the following pattern @xmath91 and@xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "it is then clear that if there is approximate @xmath0 unification as it appears to be the case if the theory below the b - l breaking scale is mssm , then in @xmath94 matrix , there is a high degree of cancellation in the @xmath95 entry making this entry comparable to all the other entries in this matrix .",
    "the atmospheric mixing angle which is given by @xmath96 becomes very large at the b - l breaking scale .",
    "since renormalization played an important role in obtaining this result , one must ask what happens to the neutrino mixings once they are extrapolated to the weak scale@xcite .",
    "it is well known@xcite that for the case of normal hierarchy for neutrino masses as is the case here , the mssm rge s do not change the mixing angles very much and the seesaw scale result persists at the weak scale with only minor changes .",
    "in this section , we outline our method for determining the neutrino mixing parameters . for this purpose , we first note that the matrices @xmath50 and @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) can be eliminated in terms the mass matrices @xmath97 so that we have a sumrule involving the three mass matrices @xmath98 . before giving the sum rule , we note that we will work in a basis where @xmath99 is diagonal and is given by @xmath100 ( where @xmath101 is the diagonal mass matrix of up type quark and @xmath102 is the ckm mixing matrix ) .",
    "this can be done without any loss of generality .",
    "we also introduce a new set of matrices @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 being the third family mass for the corresponding flavor .",
    "the sumrule for charged lepton matrices is given by : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are functions of @xmath109 ( given in sec .",
    "ii ) and fermion masses as follows : @xmath110 @xmath111 these relations are valid at the b - l breaking scale @xmath62 .",
    "the advantage of working with @xmath112 rather tha @xmath113 is that the @xmath95 elements of all @xmath114 matrices are either one or of order one ; so we expect solutions for @xmath107 and @xmath108 also of order one .",
    "furthermore since the formula for @xmath115 involves only @xmath116 and @xmath99 , @xmath0 unification helps to see the cancellation in the @xmath95 element of @xmath20 somewhat more easily . at the same time",
    "the @xmath117 element of @xmath20 receives only one contribution from @xmath116 since in our basis @xmath99 is diagonal .",
    "these two results lead to atmospheric mixing angle being large@xcite .    to carry out the calculations",
    ", we have to solve for the two unknowns @xmath107 and @xmath108 using the low energy inputs from the quark and charged lepton sectors . to obtain a perturbative estimate of these parameters",
    ", we decompose @xmath118 as : @xmath119 where @xmath120 as are @xmath121 and @xmath122 . in this analytical approach",
    ", our procedure will be to find the eigenvalues of ( [ decom ] ) by perturbation method and match them to the known leptonic masses at the b - l scale .",
    "the advantage of this decomposition is that it allows a nice perturbative determination of the eigenvalues analytically without having to resort to immediate numerical analysis .",
    "we will compare our results with the numerical evaluation using mathematica .",
    "the @xmath123 eigenvalue @xmath124 is found to be @xmath125 we consider only cases where @xmath126 and @xmath127 . within this regime ,",
    "the unperturbed 2nd and 3rd lepton masses are accurate up to a few %",
    ". however , the higher order electron mass correction is big and so the perturbation formula breaks down for this case .",
    "we therefore use the perturbation technique for the second and third generation masses but use the determinant to find that for the first generation . as mentioned , we will check the validity of perturbation result using numerical methods .",
    "taking determinant of the above equation [ decom ] , we find that the three charged lepton masses are related as follows : @xmath128 we now solve the above equation by substituting @xmath121,@xmath122,@xmath129,@xmath130,@xmath131,@xmath132 with the corresponding elements in the matrix @xmath133 . from eq.([pert1 ] ) , and find @xmath134 since eq.[decom ] tells us that @xmath135 and @xmath136 , we can use the above two equations to determine the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which we can then use to find neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "we find @xmath107 and @xmath108 to be @xmath137 and a consistency relation for the d - quark mass @xmath138 in order to get a rough feeling for the way the maximal neutrino mixings arise , let us diagonalize the charged lepton mass matrix given in eq .",

    "in summary , we find that a minimal so(10 ) model with single * 10 * and * 126 * higgs coupling to matter is a completely predictive model for neutrino masses and can provide an excellent description of the presently favored patterns for neutrino masses and mixings required by data .",

    "<S> we show that the assumption of type ii seesaw mechanism for small neutrino masses coupled with @xmath0 mass unification in a minimal susy so(10 ) model leads not only to a natural understanding of large atmospheric mixing angle ( @xmath1 ) among neutrinos , as recently pointed out , but also to large solar angle ( @xmath2 ) and a small @xmath3 as required to fit observations . </S>",
    "<S> this is therefore a minimal , completely realistic grand unified model for all low energy observations that naturally explains the diverse mixing patterns between the quark and leptons without any additional inputs such as extra global symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed long baseline neutrino experiments will provide a crucial test of this model since it predicts @xmath4 for the allowed range of parameters .    </S>",
