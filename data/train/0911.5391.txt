    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the most significant and universal mechanisms in physics @xcite . although the qcd lagrangian possesses chiral symmetry in the chiral limit , su(@xmath0 su(@xmath1 symmetry is spontaneously broken into its subgroup su(@xmath2 .",
    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is remarkably important in hadron physics @xcite . also , it is one of the dominant origins of mass in our world .",
    "chiral symmetry itself is symmetry of quarks , not gluons .",
    "however , spontaneous breaking is dynamically induced by the nonperturbative interaction of gluons .",
    "the gluon dynamics is inseparably linked with chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "our goal is to determine _ what momentum component of the gluon field induces spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking_. the relation between the eigenmode of quarks and chiral symmetry breaking is known as the banks - casher relation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the relation between the momentum component of gluons and chiral symmetry breaking is nontrivial .",
    "it is easy to expect the importance of the low - momentum gluon , but difficult to predict the detailed relation due to the nonperturbative dynamics of the low - momentum gluon .",
    "we would like to clarify such a relation nonperturbatively by lattice qcd .",
    "in other words , we quantitatively investigate _ the relevant gluonic energy scale _ of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking from lattice qcd .    to analyze the relevant gluonic energy scale , we consider momentum space of the gluon field .",
    "the gluon field is described by the link variable in lattice qcd . by manipulating the link variable in momentum space ,",
    "we directly analyze how the momentum component of the gluon field affects chiral symmetry breaking",
    ". the obtained energy scale would also be interesting from the viewpoint of a connection to other qcd phenomena , such as confinement @xcite . in lattice qcd",
    ", the connection between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking is investigated in the context of phase transition at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "our analysis is a different approach to reveal this connection .",
    "we calculate the chiral condensate @xmath3 in lattice qcd .",
    "the chiral condensate is an order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking in the chiral limit .",
    "it is nonzero in the symmetry - broken phase and zero in the symmetry - restored phase .",
    "we denote the flavor - averaged chiral condensate in the lattice unit as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the lattice spacing and @xmath6 is the quark propagator .",
    "when the quark mass is finite , the chiral condensate includes the effect of explicit breaking by the quark mass as well as spontaneous breaking . to extract the chiral limit in lattice qcd , one calculates with several quark masses and extrapolates to the chiral limit .    in this paper , we calculate the chiral condensate in su(3)@xmath7 quenched and full lattice qcd , and analyze the relevant gluonic energy scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we explain how to analyze the relevant gluonic energy scale in lattice qcd . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the simulation setup of the lattice qcd calculation . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the numerical result of the chiral condensate and analyze how the chiral condensate is affected by removing the high - momentum or low - momentum gluon .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v is devoted to a conclusion .",
    "the lattice framework to determine the relevant gluonic energy scale was proposed in ref .  @xcite . in this framework , after artificially removing some momentum component of link variables , one calculates a physical quantity and observes the role of the removed momentum component . in doing so , one can determine whether the momentum component is relevant or not for the quantity . to be self - contained , we briefly introduce the procedure in the following .",
    "the su(3)@xmath7 link variable @xmath8 is generated by monte carlo simulation .",
    "as explained below , the link variable must be fixed with a certain gauge . in this paper",
    ", we use the landau gauge for the numerical calculation . in the landau gauge",
    ", the gauge fluctuation is minimized and the connection between the link variable and the gauge field is straightforward .",
    "the momentum - space link variable @xmath9 is obtained by the fourier transformation , as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total number of lattice sites .     the schematic figure of momentum space .",
    "the shaded regions are the cut regions by the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath12 and the infrared cutoff @xmath13 .",
    "the momentum - space lattice spacing is @xmath14 . ]",
    "some component of @xmath9 is removed by introducing a momentum cutoff . in the cut region ,",
    "the momentum - space link variable is replaced by the free - field link variable @xmath15 for example , in the case of the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath12 , the momentum - space link variable is replaced as @xmath16 in the case of the infrared cutoff @xmath13 , it is replaced as @xmath17 the schematic figure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the coordinate - space link variable with the momentum cutoff is obtained by the inverse fourier transformation as @xmath18 since @xmath19 is not an su(3)@xmath7 matrix in general , @xmath19 must be projected onto an su(3)@xmath7 element @xmath20 .",
    "the projection is realized by maximizing the quantity @xmath21.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    step 5 .",
    "the expectation value of an operator @xmath22 is computed by using this link variable @xmath20 instead of @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath23\\rangle$ ] instead of @xmath24\\rangle$ ] .",
    "repeating these five steps with various values of the momentum cutoff , we observe the dependence on the momentum cutoff .",
    "then , we can determine what momentum component of the gluon field is relevant for the physical quantity .",
    "the framework is applicable to both quenched and full qcd in the same way .    indeed , this framework is powerful in determining the relevant gluonic energy scale of confinement in quenched qcd @xcite . by applying this framework to the calculation of the wilson loop",
    ", it was found that the string tension is generated by the infrared gluon below about 1.5 gev . by picking up this relevant momentum component",
    ", the quark - antiquark potential is clearly decomposed into the confinement potential and the perturbative potential . hence , the relevant gluonic energy scale of confinement was determined to be @xmath25 gev .",
    "we comment on two points of the framework .",
    "the first is the gauge fixing in step 1 . in general , since the gauge transformation is nonlocal in momentum space , the momentum region of the gauge field is a gauge - dependent concept",
    ". then , our result would depend on the gauge choice .",
    "we show the landau - gauge results in this paper .",
    "note , however , that one can analyze other gauges and the gauge dependence since the framework itself does not depend on the gauge choice @xcite .",
    "the second is the projection in step 4 .",
    "although such a projection is often used in su(3)@xmath7 lattice qcd as a workable method , the projection could in principle contaminate the original condition on the momentum cutoff . to evaluate how the projection changes link variables ,",
    "we calculate @xmath26 by adopting steps 2 - 4 once again to @xmath20 , and check the overlap between them , @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the overlap is found to be almost unity .",
    "for example , the deviation from unity is about 0.1% at @xmath28 gev .",
    "then , we can expect that the projection does not significantly change link variables .",
    "in fact , we have already reached a steady state configuration with the single procedure .",
    ".[tab1 ] the parameters of full and quenched lattice qcd configurations .",
    "the dynamical quark mass @xmath29 , the configuration number @xmath30 , the lattice spacing @xmath5 , and the momentum - space lattice spacing @xmath31 are listed . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , our result suggests another interesting possibility . at least within the present numerical accuracy ,",
    "the chiral condensate in the chiral limit remains finite at @xmath28 gev , which is the relevant gluonic energy scale of confinement .",
    "if this is true , this means that the gluonic energy scale of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is larger than that of color confinement at zero temperature .",
    "unfortunately , however , we can not make a decisive statement due to systematic error of the chiral extrapolation . for more conclusive answer",
    ", we need the full qcd calculation very close to the chiral limit , while the finite - volume effect is severely crucial in large @xmath13 and small @xmath32 .",
    "we have analyzed which momentum component of the gluon field induces spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the most dominant contribution is given by the  zero - momentum \" gluon , which roughly corresponds to the deep - infrared region of @xmath33 in the continuum .",
    "not only zero - momentum but also the  nonzero - momentum \" gluon of @xmath34 possesses a sizable contribution . while we can not precisely determine the upper limit of the relevant momentum component of the gluon field due to the finite - volume effect , its relevant momentum component seems to be broadly distributed to the intermediate - momentum region .",
    "the zero - momentum gauge field corresponds to a spatially - uniform gauge background . in general",
    ", the non - abelian gauge field could have a nontrivial effect even in spatially - uniform case , unlike the abelian gauge field .",
    "our result actually suggests that the zero - momentum gauge field contributes to the chiral condensate .",
    "note , however , that it is nontrivial whether spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs only by the spatially - uniform gauge background .",
    "the banks - casher relation states that the chiral condensate is related to the spectral density @xmath35 of the dirac operator as @xmath36 in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "the spectral density of the dirac operator is given in infinite volume as @xmath37 and the eigenvalue of the dirac operator is @xmath38 . the zero mode of quarks is directly related to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking from this relation . in contrast , the gluon field is nontrivially related to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "our result presents the connection between the momentum component of gluons and the zero mode of quarks .",
    "although the relation between the energy scales of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking is interesting , our result is not conclusive but suggestive in the present accuracy . to approach the realistic situation of qcd",
    ", we would need the reliable chiral extrapolation including the dynamical quark effect .",
