    "<S> the vacuum expectation value of fermionic current is evaluated for a massive spinor field in spacetimes with arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions in the presence of a constant gauge field . by using the abel - plana type summation formula and the zeta function technique we present the fermionic current in two different forms . </S>",
    "<S> non - trivial topology of the background spacetime leads to the aharonov - bohm effect for the fermionic current induced by the gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> the current is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum . in the absence of gauge field it vanishes for special cases of untwisted and twisted fields . </S>",
