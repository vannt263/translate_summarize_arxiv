    "nusser & davis ( 1994 ) show that in linear gravitational instability ( gi ) theory the peculiar velocity field in redshift space is irrotational and thus can be expressed in terms of a potential : @xmath0 .",
    "the angular dependencies of the potential velocity field and the galaxy overdensity field [ both measured in redshift space and expanded in spherical harmonics , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ] are related by a modified poisson equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the selection function . to solve this differential equation",
    "we first compute the density field on an angular grid using cells of equal solid angle and 52 bins in redshift out to @xmath5  kms@xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 \\label{eq : smoothing5}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all the galaxies within the catalogue @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the gaussian smoothing width for the cell @xmath10 at redshift @xmath11 , @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13^{-1/3}$ ] ( or 100  km s@xmath14when such a length is smaller than this ) , where @xmath15  and @xmath16  are the 1.2 jy mean number density and selection function , respectively .",
    "pscz  is a new redshift survey which resulted from a collaborative effort involving several british institutions ( durham , oxford , london , edinburgh and cambridge ) .",
    "the catalogue contains some 15500 iras psc ( point source catalogue ) galaxies with a 60 @xmath17 m flux larger than 0.6-jy .",
    "this survey covers 84@xmath18 of the sky .",
    "a more detailed description of the catalogue is given by saunders _",
    "_ 1999 ( these proceedings ) . the 1.2-jy catalogue ( fisher _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) contains 5321 iras  psc galaxies with a 60 @xmath19 limit of 1.2-jy which covers 87.6@xmath18 of the sky .",
    "we compare the line of sight peculiar velocity , @xmath20 \\cdot { \\hat s}$ ] , and density perturbations , @xmath21 , fields inferred from the iras pscz  and 1.2-jy redshift surveys , in redshift - space . to compute the spherical harmonics coefficients up to @xmath22",
    "we apply the algorithm introduced by nusser & davis ( 1994 ) setting @xmath23 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : irasmonopole ] we display the monopole of the velocity field , @xmath24 ( two top panels ) and the monopole of the density @xmath25 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "in the top - left panel , the estimate of the velocity monopole in the 1.2-jy ( dashed line ) is systematically larger than the pscz one ( continuous thick line ) within a redshift of @xmath26  km s@xmath6 .",
    "the density monopole of the two surveys show a similar qualitative radial dependency ( bottom panel ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : irasdipoles ] we show the three velocity dipole terms of the two surveys along with the total amplitude ( bottom left panel ) .",
    "the various dipole moments exhibit good agreement , except @xmath27 ( top left panel ) for which there is a discrepancy of 100  km@xmath28  in the redshift range @xmath29  kms@xmath6 .",
    "good agreement is also found when comparing higher order multipoles ( teodoro _ et al . _",
    "note that when all the multipoles are considered ( _ i.e. _  when performing a full v - v comparison ) the pscz and 1.2-jy gravity fields look fully consistent ( branchini _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) .",
    "in all plots , shaded and hatched regions represent 1-@xmath30 shot - noise uncertainties computed from 20 bootstrap realizations of pscz and 1.2 jy surveys , respectively .",
    "where does the discrepancy between the monopoles of the pscz and 1.2 jy surveys come from ? as shown in the plots , the difference is larger than that expected from the shot - noise .",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) have suggested that the pscz  catalogue may be incomplete for fluxes @xmath31  jy .",
    "if true , then we would expect that the velocity monopole for the pscz  with a flux cut at 0.7 jy ( pscz@xmath32 ) would be in good agreement with the 1.2-jy survey . the dotted line ( @xmath33 ) in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : irasmonopole ] shows however that this is not case .",
    "it is only in cutting the pscz catalogue at a flux level of 1.2 jy that , as expected , the discrepancy disappears , provided that we use the same mask for both catalogues .",
    "this is clearly seen in the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : irasmonopole ] in which the thin and dot - dashed lines indicate 1.2-jy@xmath34(1.2 jy with the same mask as pscz ) and pscz@xmath35 ( pscz with a 1.2 jy flux limit ) velocity monopoles , respectively .",
    "a more detailed comparison between the two catalogues is in progress in which we assess the importance of systematic errors by using a suite of 1.2 jy and pscz mock catalogues drawn from n - body simulations .",
