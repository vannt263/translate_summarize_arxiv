    "this fact is in agreement with the experimental evidence that the charge carriers velocity in a material can not be higher than the saturation velocity due to collisions with the acoustic phonons @xcite .",

    "other drift - diffusion models for spin - polarized electron transport have been derived in @xcite from a spinor boltzmann equation with spin - flip and non spin - flip collision operators under the hypothesis that the former is a small perturbation of the latter , and in @xcite from a wigner equation with semiclassical matrix collision operator under the assumption that spin - orbit coupling is small in comparison with the electron kinetic energy .",

    "<S> the presence of a nonconstant and nonsmooth magnetization vector , solution of the landau - lifshitz equation , causes the diffusion matrix to be dependent from space and time and to have in general poor regularity properties , thus making the analysis challenging . to partially overcome the analytical difficulties the velocity saturation hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> is made , which results in a bounded drift velocity . the global - in - time existence and uniqueness of weak solutions </S>",
    "<S> is shown by means of a semi - discretization in time , which yields an elliptic semilinear problem , and a quadratic entropy inequality , which allow for the limit of vanishing time step size . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of the weak solutions to the steady state , under some restrictions on the parameters and data , is shown . </S>",
    "<S> finally the higher regularity of solutions for a smooth magnetization in two space dimensions is shown through a diagonalization argument , which allows to get rid of the cross diffusion terms in the fluid equations , and the iterative application of gagliardo - nirenberg inequalities and a generalized version of aubin lemma .    </S>",
