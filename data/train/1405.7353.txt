    "starting from the maxwell stress tensor for a static magnetic field , the total lorentz force acting on a bulk of plasma in the solar atmosphere ( at and above the photosphere ) can be written as a surface integral of the photosphere field @xmath0 , assuming the contribution from the top and side boundaries is negligible @xcite .",

    "recent observations have confirmed that rapid , permanent changes take place in the photospheric field during major flares @xcite .",
    "this change results in a lorentz force impulse @xcite ; the change of force @xmath6 is @xmath7    during major flares , @xmath8 generally increases , while @xmath9 remains less effected .",
    "this results in a positive @xmath10 , the impulse of which may help launch the ejecta .",
    "one may estimate the cme mass @xmath11 , for example , from @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the interaction time scale ( e.g. minutes ) , and @xmath14 the cme speed . as another example , the change of torque from @xmath15 has been used to explain the sudden angular velocity change of the rotating sunspots during a large flare @xcite .    it is worthwhile to note that the lorentz force or lorentz force impulse acting on the solar interior ( at the photosphere and below ) are equal and opposite to the values given by equation set  [ eq : lorentz ] .    , where @xmath16 is the pixel area .",

    "_ orbital - velocity - related periodicity_. due to the geosynchronous orbit of sdo , the line profile shifts throughout the day .",
    "this affects the magnetic field determination , mostly in the line - of - sight component @xcite .",
    "the variation is estimated to be about 1@xmath23 in the umbrae , 2@xmath23 in the penumbrae , and 5@xmath23 in the quiet regions .",

    "_ longitudinal dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath3_. we find that the integrated @xmath1 is generally positive on the eastern hemisphere , and negative on the west .",
    "the values scale approximately linearly with longitude , and the relative magnitude @xmath24 ( ` epsx ` ) can be several tens of percent when the ar is away from the central meridian .",

    "( the ar patch disambiguation uses the noise mask plus a 20  g constant as the threshold , whereas for full disk the constant increases to 50  g to speed up the computation . )",

    "it can also be very different for individual subregions .",
    "conclusions from the indices should be checked against the maps .",
    "the sudden changes of @xmath3 ( over about one hour ) can be small compared to the secular ones ( over days ) .",

    "however , the integrated @xmath3 may display a spike - like profile , returning to the pre - flare values soon after the eruption ( figure  [ f : jsoc](b ) ) .",
    "difference maps show that the increase near the polarity inversion line is compensated by the decrease in peripheral regions ( figure  [ f : map](c ) ) .",
    "the increasing noise level in the vector field towards limb and the varying noise - mask yield a variation of the number of pixels included in the computation .",
