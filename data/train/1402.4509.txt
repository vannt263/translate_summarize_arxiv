    "the dust and gas that comprise the interstellar medium ( ism ) play an important role in galaxy evolution , despite the fact that they constitute a relatively small fraction of each galaxy s total mass ( e.g. , @xmath710% in the milky way ) .",
    "the presence of interstellar dust is physically manifested both through absorption and scattering processes which redistribute @xmath630% of the starlight emitted at uv - optical wavelengths over a range of infrared ( ir ) wavelengths @xcite , and through the depletion of refractory elements from ism gas . the physical and chemical states of the ism are significantly affected by the dust , which regulates the thermal energy balance through the ejection of photoelectrons in photodissociation regions , and via ir emission from molecular and shock - heated plasmas .",
    "dust grain surfaces also promote the formation of molecules , such as h@xmath8 , which act as a coolant facilitating molecular cloud collapse .",
    "as the ism gas is formed into new stars and the galaxy s stellar population evolves , the ratio of the silicate dust to the carbonaceous dust reflects the relative abundances of their different stellar sources .",
    "silicate dust is typically produced in oxygen - rich environments , such as near type ii supernovae or agb stars with low c / o ratios , while carbonaceous dust is associated with carbon - rich environments , such as near evolved low - mass stars , although the details of the formation are still debated both in local and in higher redshift galaxies [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "since dust is relatively quickly destroyed through shock processing in the ism , with a typical lifetime of @xmath9500  myr for many dust species @xcite , interstellar dust is a sensitive probe of the state of the ism material and stellar populations at a given epoch , assuming that selective destruction and reformation rates in the ism are not highly variable .",
    "quasar absorption systems ( qass ) provide a unique tool to simultaneously probe the dust and gas content in the ism of distant galaxies , independent of galaxies intrinsic luminosities or star - formation rates .",
    "the study of qass exploits sightlines to distant , luminous objects , such as quasars , that emit radiation over a wide - range of frequencies . as the quasar light passes through foreground galaxies , interstellar",
    "gas and dust produce absorption features in the quasar spectrum .",
    "the ism of any galaxy with a luminous background source can be studied with this technique , but it is particularly effective when applied to the most gas - rich systems , such as damped lyman-@xmath10 absorbers ( dlas ; neutral hydrogen column densities n@xmath11 @xmath12 ) and sub - dlas ( 10@xmath13n@xmath14 @xmath12 ) .",
    "these gas - rich qass are the primary neutral gas reservoir for star formation in the universe [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "as opposed to flux - limited studies of gas and dust in emission , that are biased toward the most robustly star - forming objects , qass provide insight into more quiescent or moderately - star - forming galaxies , potentially more similar to local group galaxies .",
    "evidence for the presence of interstellar dust in gas - rich qass has been found in both moderate - to - large surveys , as well as in investigations of individual systems .",
    "studies of qass show depletions of refractory elements and reddening of background quasars @xcite , as well as a correlation between dust - reddening and gas metal absorption line strengths in absorbers at 1@xmath15z@xmath152 @xcite .",
    "the bulk of analyses exploring dust spectral properties in qass , however , concentrate on signatures associated with the carbonaceous dust component , such as the 2175    bump , rather than on the silicate dust , which exhibits prominent ir features near 10 and 18  @xmath1 [ see , e.g. , @xcite for review of dust spectral signatures and their origins ] .",
    "it is important to also consider this silicate dust , both because it is primarily produced by a different stellar sub - population , and because within the milky way @xmath766% of the core mass of interstellar dust grains is silicate in composition @xcite .    in an exploratory study ,",
    "our group made the first measurement of silicate dust in a qas .",
    "a @xmath610-@xmath2 detection of the 9.7  @xmath16 m silicate absorption feature was made in the z@xmath17 dla toward ao 0235 + 164 using low - resolution _",
    "spitzer space telescope infrared spectrograph ( irs ) _ data .",
    "this was followed by identification of the 9.7  @xmath1  silicate absorption feature in 5 additional strong qass at redshifts 0.44@xmath181.31 @xcite .",
    "analyses of the silicate dust in these 6 qass suggest both similarities and differences relative to that in the milky way ism . in the milky way",
    "diffuse interstellar clouds , the peak optical depth of the silicate absorption is seen to scale with the extinction ( @xmath19 ) , and hence with the reddening [ e(b - v)=@xmath20 where @xmath21 , the selective extinction , is @xmath73.1 ] . in the studied qass ,",
    "the silicate optical depth similarly scales with the reddening .",
    "however , the absorption features are 2 - 4 times deeper for a given reddening than those in the milky way @xcite",
    ". this disparity may stem from differences in dust composition , metallicity , and/or grain size distributions .",
    "a larger selective extinction may imply , for instance , larger dust grain sizes .",
    "furthermore , in these 6 qass comparisons of the peak wavelengths of the 10  @xmath1  silicate absorption feature , and of the substructure within the feature , reveal variations suggestive of mineralogical and grain structural differences relative to one - another , and relative to the milky way ism @xcite .",
    "these differences are most pronounced in the z=0.886 absorber toward pks 1830 - 211 @xcite , where the 10  @xmath1 absorption feature substructure is consistent with a crystalline olivine silicate dust grain origin , in marked contrast with the amorphous ( @xmath155% crystalline ) silicate dust grains in the milky way ism @xcite .",
    "exploring whether these trends and variations are found in other qass is essential for quantifying the evolution in dust grain properties .    in this paper , we make progress toward this goal by presenting the first analysis of the 10 and 18  @xmath1 silicate absorption features in the z@xmath0=0.68466@xmath40.00004 absorber @xcite toward the gravitationally lensed , z=0.944@xmath40.002 blazar txs 0218 + 357 at ra ( j2000)= 0221055  and dec ( j2000 ) = + 355614   @xcite . throughout our analysis",
    "we simply refer to this z@xmath0=0.6847 system , which is by far the strongest known metal absorption system along the quasar sightline , as _ the _ txs 0218 + 357 qas .",
    "the txs 0218 + 357 qas was selected for this study for several reasons .",
    "first , this qas is relatively rich in both gas and dust .",
    "the abundance of gas is evident from the large measured mg  ii absorption rest - frame equivalent width w@xmath223.0   , the high molecular hydrogen column density ( @xmath23 @xmath12 ) , and the detections of 21-cm absorption implying @xmath24 @xmath12 , where @xmath25 is the gas spin temperature and @xmath26 is the h  i covering factor @xcite .",
    "there are also signatures of dust in the qas , including an exceedingly high measured reddening of the background quasar .",
    "statistical studies of mean dla extinction curves using sdss data find that most qass at 1@xmath15z@xmath155 have a typical rest - frame reddening of e(b - v)@xmath70.002 @xcite , while the txs 0218 + 357 qas exhibits a total measured e(b - v)=0.62@xmath40.04 , assuming r@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "second , this qas is known to be rich in molecules , similar to the pks 1830 - 211 z=0.886 absorber .",
    "since in the pks 1830 - 211 qas the interstellar silicate dust may be significantly crystalline @xcite , unlike that in the milky way , it is important to ascertain whether other molecule - rich qass are likewise potentially rich in crystalline silicates .",
    "molecules such as co , ch , and h@xmath8 trace cold , dense , star - forming material in the galaxy ism .",
    "the txs 0218 + 357 qas exhibits transitions for numerous molecules including co , hco@xmath28 , hcn , hnc , cn , cs , c@xmath29o , @xmath30co , h@xmath8o , nh@xmath31 , oh , h@xmath8co and its anti inversion , and the primordial lih molecule which traces h@xmath8 in low metallicity regions @xcite . moreover , this absorber has among the highest molecular column densities at this redshift range @xcite .",
    "studies of the qas reveal that one of the gravitationally - lensed quasar sightlines passes through an optically thick and clumpy molecular cloud , while the other sightline passes through a more optically thin region @xcite .",
    "the derived column densities and abundances for molecules such as formaldehyde along the more obscured sightline are similar to those found in milky way molecular clouds @xcite , while the nh@xmath31 absorption measurements are more consistent with a diffuse cloud origin @xcite .",
    "third , the z@xmath0=0.68466 qas redshift is optimal for studying both the 10 and 18  @xmath1 silicate absorption features with the _ irs _ instrument used in our previous studies . in the qas rest - frame , the irs spectra span the region 3.1 - 22.6  @xmath1 , with adequate quasar continuum coverage between the absorption features",
    "additionally , for this quasar the _ irs _ sensitivity was sufficient to obtain data for this analysis in only 30 minutes of exposure time .",
    "fourth , the z@xmath32=0.944 @xcite background quasar is gravitationally lensed , which boosts its signal , and hence the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the qas gas and silicate dust absorption features .",
    "furthermore , since this is a well - studied strong lens system , information about the qas host galaxy topography , which is often lacking for other qass , is available .",
    "studies of the morphology of the lensing galaxy hosting the qas indicate it is a gas - rich spiral galaxy with narrow absorption ( ca  ii h&k , mg  ii , fe  ii , mg  i ) and emission ( [ oii ] , h@xmath33 , [ oiii ] ) lines @xcite , suggestive of some ongoing star - formation , comparable to that in spiral galaxies like the milky way based on the measured [ oii ] equivalent width @xcite .",
    "radio studies [ e.g. , @xcite ] reveal that the quasar is being lensed into two point sources and a small einstein ring with an angular diameter of 335 mas ( @xmath72.4  kpc in the lensing galaxy for h@xmath34=70 km / s / mpc ) .",
    "the optical and ir magnitudes along the two compact - object lines of sight imply a reddened and optically faint ( v@xmath621mag ) source @xcite .",
    "lastly , owing to the well - studied strong gravitational lens , as well as to the monitored ( variable ) blazar , abundant ancillary data are available for this system .",
    "these data include spectral energy distributions ( seds ) extending from the @xmath35 ray ( e.g. fermi , rosat , swift ) through the optical and nir ( e.g. hst ) , to the sub - mm ( e.g. nrao , pdbi ) and radio ( e.g. , vla , vlba ) . however , while these data provide global constraints , owing to the blazar variability , predicting the flux at a given epoch is challenging .    in this paper , we begin with a description of the _ irs _ observations , followed by a summary of the data reduction (  [ irsspect ] ) , spectral extractions (  [ extract ] ) , and quasar continuum normalizations (  [ norm ] ) .",
    "we then discuss the profile template fitting to the silicate absorption features produced by the txs 0218 + 357 qas (  [ results ] ) .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our findings in comparison with the silicate dust in other qass (  [ disc ] ) , followed by a summary of our main results (  [ sum ] ) . in the appendices ,",
    "we show the effects of different quasar continuum normalizations on our results ( appendix  [ normap ] ) , and discuss details of the template profiles applied to the data ( appendix  [ templateap ] ) .",
    "our data consist of spectra of the txs 0218 + 357 quasar obtained using the _ irs _ instrument aboard the _ spitzer space telescope _ , as summarized in table  [ obsit ] .",
    "these data were observed as part of program 50783 ( pi : v.p .",
    "kulkarni ) in the irs staring mode .",
    "the blue peak - up filter with high peak - up accuracy was used to identify the quasar .",
    "five exposures were taken in each of the two nod positions at every available low - resolution spectral order , for a total of 10 exposures per order .",
    "lccc sl2 & 5.2 - 7.7 & 3.1 - 4.6 & 10x60s + sl3 & 7.3 - 8.7 & 4.3 - 5.2 & 10x60s + sl1 & 7.4 - 14.5 & 4.4 - 8.6 & 10x60s + ll2 & 14.0 - 21.3 & 8.3 - 12.6 & 10x30s + ll3 & 19.4 - 21.7 & 11.5 - 12.9 & 10x30s + ll1 & 19.5 - 38.0 & 11.6 - 22.6 & 10x30s + [ obsit ]    although the quasar txs 0218 + 357",
    "is gravitationally lensed into a 335 mas diameter einstein ring and two bright , compact components also separated by 335 mas @xcite , our data do not resolve these individual sightlines through the foreground absorber . according to the irs manual ,",
    "the fwhm spatial profile widths obtained for calibration point sources ( stars ) exceed 25 for every spectral order .",
    "_ irs _ slits range in width from 36 ( sl2)-107 ( ll1 ) and in length from 57 - 168@xcite . each _ irs _ spectrum , thus , is the superposition of the multiple sightlines through the qas , and so we can not investigate spatial variations in the galaxy ism .",
    "the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) spectra obtained over the 40 total exposures were automatically reduced using the _ spitzer irs _ basic calibrated data ( bcd ) pipeline version s18.18.0 .",
    "this pipeline applied bias and dark subtractions , as well as flat - fielding the data .",
    "it also corrected for systemic effects such as droop and dark - current drift @xcite .    prior",
    "to subtracting the background and extracting the quasar spectrum , we implemented two phases of bad - pixel cleaning ( i.e. replacement ) .",
    "the background bad pixels were first cleaned using _ irsclean _ ( version 2.1 ) , followed by the manual replacement of remaining anomalous background pixels and hot / cold pixels along the quasar spectrum using the _ image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) epix _ task .",
    "typically fewer than 6 pixels were replaced along the quasar spectrum in a single exposure .",
    "our tests find that our cleaning method results in a more conservative estimate of the significance of the structural parameters than would be obtained using the uncleaned , raw bcd data .",
    "the cleaned exposures in each nod position were combined using the _ spitzer _ _ idl _ script _ coad_. each pixel value in the combined frame was computed as the trimmed mean of the pixels in the input images .",
    "pixels with no value and those fatally flagged in the associated mask files were excluded .",
    "the corresponding pixel uncertainty was computed as the square root of the sum of the squares in the input uncertainty file , normalized by the number of pixels used to calculate the trimmed mean .",
    "we subtracted the background from each of the coadded frames using the nod exposures .",
    "a background - subtracted 2d spectrum was produced by subtracting the nod frames from one another .",
    "the associated uncertainty files were propagated in quadrature .",
    "the wavelength - calibrated , 1d quasar spectrum was extracted from the background - subtracted , 2-d spectrum for each nod using the _ spice gui _ ( version 2.5 ) .",
    "each extraction was run using the generic point - source extraction mode with the optimal extraction setting .",
    "the optimal extraction weights each pixel in the aperture using the s / n of the pixel , as computed using the associated pipeline uncertainty file .",
    "this method improves the s /",
    "n for intrinsically low - s / n spectra .",
    "the spectra from the two nods were combined by averaging the flux values at every wavelength .",
    "the associated uncertainties are a combination in quadrature of the formal uncertainty associated with the mean ( determined by propagating the pipeline uncertainties ) and the scatter of the flux measurements about the mean at a given wavelength .",
    "in general , data points in the final spectrum with large error bars stem from discrepancies between the two nod spectra .",
    "these differences may originate from a slightly hot pixel along the quasar spectrum or from an emission feature which lies on a cold pixel in one nod .",
    "rather than eliminating these data points or simplistically assuming them to originate in hot pixels , we conservatively retain them .",
    "these noisy points have a minimal impact on our absorption feature fitting , because their large uncertainties effectively de - weight the data points .",
    "the nod - averaged spectra ( sl2 , sl1 , ll2 , ll1 ) were stitched together to produce a single contiguous spectrum .",
    "a few ( @xmath363 ) anomalous data points at each spectral segment edge were removed to produce a smoother joining .",
    "all data at @xmath3735.8  @xmath1 were rejected , as they showed significant degradation .",
    "the sl2 and sl1 data were scaled by multiplicative factors to match the identically cleaned and extracted overlap ( sl3 ) data .",
    "a similar process was repeated for scaling the ll1 and ll2 orders to match the the ll overlap ( ll3 ) data , and scaling the ll orders to match the sl orders .",
    "the final multiplicative rescaling factors for the sl2 , sl1 , ll2 , and ll1 orders were 0.82 , 0.92 , 1.14 , and 1.05 , respectively .",
    "since the resultant quasar spectrum is continuum normalized prior to our analysis of the silicate absorption features , as described below , the absolute flux normalization is not crucial .",
    "the overlapping data points at the order joinings were averaged to produce a single flux at each wavelength .",
    "the errors are a combination of the propagated measurement uncertainties and the standard deviation about the mean for each data point .",
    "a visual inspection indicated that the uncertainties in the sl1/sl2 and ll1/ll2 overlap regions were typically larger than those in the associated overlap spectra ( sl3 , ll3 ) .",
    "therefore , in regions where an overlap spectrum flux value was available , it was used in place of the first and second order data .",
    "tests indicate that these replacements slightly reduce the mean uncertainties in the final spectrum , while not impacting the shape of the absorption features or quasar continuum .",
    "the final combined spectrum is shown in figure  [ spect ] ( left ) , as a function of the observed wavelength .",
    "we do not bin the data in this analysis , as was done in the analyses of several previous qass @xcite , because while binning reduces the data point uncertainties , it may also obscure substructure in the absorption features .    the combined , unbinned quasar spectrum",
    "was finally shifted to the z=0.68466 redshift qas rest - frame .",
    "this qas rest - frame spectrum was used in all subsequent steps of the analysis , including fitting the quasar continuum and performing the mineralogical fits to the silicate absorption features .",
    "all wavelengths referred to in the following sections are in the qas rest - frame , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "we normalized the combined spectrum by the quasar continuum , prior to measuring the silicate absorption features .",
    "the physical shape of the quasar continuum is unknown .",
    "therefore , we fitted a series of low - order functions to our data , including linear , power - law , 3rd order chebyshev polynomial , and cubic spline fits .",
    "we experimented with several different fitting regions and data point exclusions for each fit , as detailed in appendix  [ normap ] .",
    "we selected as the best - fitting a 3rd order chebyshev polynomial fitted by excluding the 8.5 - 12.5  @xmath1 and 16.5 - 20.4  @xmath1 regions containing the silicate absorption features , and manually rejecting several data points with anomalously large uncertainties and deviant flux values in the ll1/ll2 joining region .",
    "this fit visually matches the data slightly better than the other considered quasar continuum fits , although _ all _ normalizations result in similar 10  @xmath1 silicate feature fits , as detailed in appendix  [ normap ] .",
    "the largest discrepancies occur for the 18  @xmath1 absorption feature , which is near the ` red ' end of our covered spectral range . depending on the shape of the adopted fit",
    ", the 18  @xmath1 feature may be relatively broad and deep , or may be narrow and shallow . since there are no mid - ir ( _ spitzer irac , mips _ ; _ herschel pacs _ ) archival data to constrain the slope of the continuum beyond our spectrum , and far - ir / radio data obtained in different epochs",
    "can not be compared reliably ( due to the temporal variability of the blazar ) , we can not determine the physical quasar continuum shape near 18  @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we do not emphasize our analysis of the 18  @xmath1 absorption feature .",
    "the final quasar - continuum - normalized spectrum we obtained is depicted in figure  [ spect ] ( right ) .",
    "an examination of the continuum normalized spectrum ( figure  [ spect ] , right ) reveals a detection of both relatively strong 10  @xmath1 silicate absorption , as well as a broader and shallower 18  @xmath1 silicate feature .",
    "we measured the rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of the 10  @xmath1 feature to be 0.83@xmath40.08  @xmath1 , which corresponds to a 10.7@xmath2 detection significance .",
    "we conservatively estimate the equivalent width uncertainty to be the combination ( in quadrature ) of the photon noise and the continuum noise , with the continuum noise dominating . to estimate the continuum uncertainty , we used the prescription of @xcite , with a  nudge factor \" of 0.3 .",
    "this equivalent width is nearly quadruple that of the 10  @xmath1 absorption feature in the z=0.524 qas toward ao 0235 + 164 , and is almost double that of the largest 10  @xmath1 equivalent width qass previously studied @xcite .",
    "we similarly measured the ew of the 18  @xmath1 silicate feature to be 1.40@xmath40.35  @xmath1 ; a 4.1@xmath2 significance detection .",
    "we caution , however , that the continuum normalization near 18  @xmath1 remains uncertain because of the absence of longer - wavelength data . this feature may be over- or under - estimated .",
    "if we assume that the absorption profile is produced by amorphous olivine , as we discuss below , then this equivalent width is a lower limit , because the predicted 18  @xmath1 feature extends past the ` red ' edge of our data .      in order to determine the peak optical depth and to place some constraints on the mineralogical composition and grain properties of the dust producing the silicate absorption features , we fitted template profiles to the normalized quasar spectrum .",
    "we follow the methodology outlined in @xcite .",
    "the transmitted flux at any frequency @xmath38 is given by f@xmath39/f@xmath40 $ ] , where @xmath41 is the measured optical depth at frequency @xmath38 , assuming a constant covering factor ( @xmath42 ) of 1.0 .",
    "the optical depth can be expressed in terms of the peak optical depth ( @xmath43 ) and the template unity - normalized optical depth profile ( @xmath44 ) as @xmath45 .",
    "the optimal peak optical depth is determined by minimizing the chi - squared over the specified fitting region .",
    "the 1-@xmath2 uncertainty is determined from an interpolation of the high and low @xmath43 values , where @xmath46=1.0 relative to the minimum measured chi - squared .",
    "we determine which mineral best fits the observed silicate absorption profile by comparing the reduced chi - squared ( @xmath47 ) values and the chi - squared probabilities , which quantify the probability that a similar or larger @xmath48 would be obtained by chance .",
    "we considered a representative sample of silicate template profiles obtained from the literature for laboratory minerals and for astrophysical samples of sic .",
    "these laboratory templates include both amorphous olivines ( mg@xmath49fe@xmath50sio@xmath51 ) and pyroxenes ( mg@xmath52fe@xmath53sio@xmath31 ) and crystalline olivines and pyroxenes , with a range of chemical compositions and grain temperatures , shapes , porosities , and sizes .",
    "we explore multiple templates in each mineral category because studies [ e.g. , @xcite ] have established that physical variations in these grain properties , as well as the laboratory methodology employed to measure the mineral properties for a given species , can significantly impact the silicate profile shape and peak absorption wavelengths . in our analysis , however , we only describe the results for the best - fitting ( lowest @xmath47 and highest probability ) profile fit in each mineral category .",
    "all of the template profiles have been measured for , or utilized in , comparison with galactic astrophysical dust sources , and are discussed in more detail in appendix  [ templateap ] , and in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our goal in exploring these template profile fits is _ not _ to unambiguously determine the mineral and dust grain properties which explain the observed silicate dust absorption .",
    "this would require much higher s / n data .",
    "rather , we use the templates to place some constraints on the dust grain properties , by exploring whether certain classes of minerals are viable and whether certain classes of minerals can be ruled - out as plausible origins for the observed silicate features .",
    "we explore several minerals in each category solely to ensure that an entire mineral category is not ruled out simply because one or two species of minerals in the category fit the data poorly .",
    "in addition to considering the single mineral fits , we also briefly consider the possibility that the silicate dust may be a mixture of two different minerals or grain structures .",
    "@xcite found that silicate dust in ulirgs was best explained by a mixture of amorphous and crystalline olivines .",
    "likewise , there is no reason why the interstellar dust in the txs 0218 + 357 qas must be homogeneous .",
    "we implement these two - mineral fits by determining @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the expression f@xmath56/f@xmath57 $ ] again assuming a constant covering factor of @xmath58 , following the methodology described in @xcite      we commence with fitting the template profiles to _ only _ the txs 0218 + 357 qas 10  @xmath1 silicate absorption feature .",
    "we restrict fitting ( i.e. @xmath48-minimization ) to the @xmath59 region in which the absorption occurs .",
    "this relatively narrow fitting region is adopted to prevent undue weighting from other , weaker spectral features which may exist within the quasar continuum .",
    "small changes in the breadth of the fitting region have little impact on our results .",
    "the fitting results are summarized in table  [ fits-10 ] and the fits are illustrated in the left panels of figures  [ bestsinglefit]-[singlefit ] .",
    "the best fit is produced by a species of amorphous olivine with porous , ellipsoidal dust grains ( amorph.oliv.gpc ) , with a measured peak optical depth for the 10  @xmath1 feature of @xmath3=0.49@xmath40.02 . as illustrated in the left panel of figure  [ bestsinglefit ] , this profile well matches the depth , breadth , and peak location of the silicate feature .",
    "the best mineral fits in the other mineral categories are inferior both statistically ( table  [ fits-10 ] ) and visually ( figure  [ singlefit ] ) .",
    "amorphous pyroxene and sic have both been exploited to explain silicate dust absorption in milky way environments such as near agb stars [ e.g. @xcite ] . however , we find , for our data on the txs 0218 + 357 qas , that the best - fitting amorphous pyroxene ( amorph.pryox.gpc ; porous , ellipsoidal grains ) and sic ( green @xmath10-sic ) templates explored produce particularly poor fits to the data ( @xmath48 fit probabilities consistent with 0% ) .",
    "the fits neither match the peak wavelength nor the breadth of the observed absorption feature .",
    "crystalline olivines and pyroxenes have been utilized to explain silicate absorption features in both galactic [ e.g. , @xcite ] and extragalactic [ e.g. , @xcite ] dust .",
    "our best - fitting crystalline olivine ( t=10k low - temperature forsterite ; mg@xmath60sio@xmath51 ) and crystalline pyroxene ( orthobronzite ; mg@xmath61fe@xmath62sio@xmath31 ) fits are mildly suggestive that some crystalline material could be present , but the fits are poorer than for amorphous olivine ( see table  [ fits-10 ] ) .",
    "although some features expected for these minerals align with substructure in our absorption profile , such as the small central ridge in the 10  @xmath1 absorption feature , all of the substructure is our data is well - within the noise uncertainty limits , and so does not provide compelling evidence for crystallinity .    if we instead used the galactic astrophysical profile templates discussed in @xcite to fit the data , our peak optical depth for the 10  @xmath1 feature would be largely unchanged . of the three templates , the diffuse cloud @xmath16cephei red supergiant @xcite template produces the best match to our data , with @xmath63 and a @xmath64 ( p=59% ) . while the optical depth is consistent with that derived using the laboratory amorphous olivine template , the fit quality is poorer .",
    "the gcs-3 galactic center diffuse ism source @xcite also provides an adequate fit ( @xmath47=1.09 , p=26% ) with a consistent optical depth ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the only template discussed in @xcite which does not provide a good fit to our data is the trapezium molecular cloud @xcite template which has a @xmath66 fit ( @xmath48 fit probability consistent with 0% ) .",

    "this difference in viewing angle may mean that a single , less common , type of dust grain could disproportionately impact the derived total reddening for face - on galaxies . however , the good agreement between our silicate absorption profile and that for amorphous olivine , which has also been used to describe milky way ism silicate dust grains , would imply that the silicate dust grains are somewhat similar .",
    "this might suggest that the disparity stems instead from a difference in the underlying stellar populations producing the dust . a larger sample of qass , particularly qass with large silicate optical depths ,",

    "when the covering factors are applied to the 21 cm and silicate peak optical depth measurements ( figure  [ t21plot ] , left ) , the trend becomes less clear , largely because of the high derived @xmath83 optical depth for the pks 1830 - 211 system , which has a low covering factor .",

    "this is because since the mg  ii lines are saturated in the absorbers studied by @xcite , the mg  ii equivalent width is a better proxy for the velocity spread ( i.e. the absorber mass or presence of outflows into the cgm ) than for the elemental abundance of metals in the ism gas .",

    "if we exclude the txs 0218 + 357 outlier point , however , we would obtain a stronger pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86 ( 6% probability of no correlation ) and kendall s tau of 0.60 ( significance 0.14 ) . a linear least - squares fit to all 6 qass , weighting solely by the @xmath3 uncertainties , since measurement uncertainties are not available for all of the mg  ii measurements in the literature , produces a slope of 0.042@xmath40.005 for the measured optical depth values , and 0.040@xmath40.005 using the covering - factor corrected optical depths .",
    "this relationship is illustrated as a dashed line .",
    "the previously studied 5 qass cluster around this line , while the txs 0218 + 357 qas lies substantially above the fit .",
    "if the txs 0218 + 357 qas is excluded from the fit , the slope decreases slightly to 0.035@xmath40.005 ( same for the corrected optical depths ) , as depicted with the dotted line .",
    "a larger sample will be required to see whether the txs 0218 + 357 qas is anomalous , or whether the suggested correlation is not as tight was was implied with the earlier sample of qass .",
    "some of the discrepancy for the txs 0218 + 357 qas may arise if the mg  ii line in this system is not saturated , unlike in the 5 previously studied qass .",
    "this may be caused in part by the mg  ii slit encompassing both quasar sightlines , one of which has significantly less absorption and is brighter at optical wavelengths . while the equivalent width ratio of the lines is suggestive of saturation , the resolution and s / n of the spectrum are not high enough to definitively assess if the lines are saturated @xcite . if the lines are unsaturated , the mg  ii measurement may be providing an estimate more reflective of the elemental abundance than of the galaxy dynamics ( i.e. the velocity spread ) .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the sampled sightline through the txs 0218 + 357 qas s nearly face - on galaxy probes inner regions which produce less efficient galactic outflows of warm gas containing mg  ii , and that if viewed from a different sightline a higher mg  ii equivalent width would be obtained . if an elemental discrepancy is invoked , the ism gas in this system may be mg - poor either because of an intrinsic deficit in the total ( gas+solid phase ) amount of mg , which would also result in less mg - rich ( more fe - rich ) species of olivines / pyroxene silicates . alternatively , the gas may be mg - poor because of depletions onto the dust grains , resulting in mg - rich olivines / pyroxenes .",
    "data with higher spectral resolution and s / n , and with longer wavelength coverage , are required to discriminate better between these silicate species .",
    "lastly , the txs 0218 + 357 qas provides an interesting opportunity to investigate whether there is a link between silicate crystallinity and a high enrichment of molecular material .",
    "the degree of silicate crystallinity depends on the conditions ( e.g. , temperature ) under which the dust grains formed and the subsequent processing of the dust grains ( e.g. , by cosmic rays , grain - grain collisions ) , and , therefore , has implications for the evolution of the dust grains [ e.g. , @xcite ] . in the z=0.886 qas toward pks 1830 - 211 , a system which has been noted to have the largest number ( 28 ) of detected molecular species in any extragalactic object to date @xcite , we previously found very suggestive evidence for a high degree of silicate crystallinity @xcite .",
    "this evidence for crystallinity stems from the shape and location of the substructure in the observed qas 10  @xmath1 silicate absorption feature . since in the milky way ism",
    "the silicate dust is predominately amorphous @xcite , this raises the question of how the silicate dust in pks 1830 - 211 could be so much more crystalline , and whether it is linked to the high degree of molecule - enrichment . for instance , does some aspect ( e.g. temperature , density ) of the ism environment facilitate the formation of both molecules and crystalline silicate grains ?",
    "since the txs 0218 + 357 qas",
    "is also noted to be very rich in molecules , and exhibits 10  @xmath1 silicate absorption , it provides a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis .",
    "the txs 0218 + 357 qas has been noted to exhibit signatures of many molecules , including co , hco@xmath28 , hcn , hnc , cn , cs , c@xmath29o , @xmath30co , h@xmath8o , nh@xmath31 , oh , h@xmath8co , and lih @xcite . as for the lensed pks 1830 - 211 z=0.886 qas",
    ", it appears that one of the two quasar sightlines ( both of which are encompassed by the _ irs _ slit ) is more enriched .",
    "although a direct comparison of the abundances in the z=0.886 pks 1830 - 211 qas and the txs 0218 + 357 qas is challenging , since derived molecular abundances depend on assumptions about the degree of line saturation , the covering factor , and the excitation temperature , for most molecules it appears that the txs 0218 + 357 qas is slightly less enriched . the oh and hco@xmath28 column densities are both good predictors of n@xmath113 in galactic clouds @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison in @xcite finds that the derived n@xmath114 and n@xmath115 column densities in txs 0218 + 357 are 19 - 23% of those for the z=0.886 pks 1830 - 211 absorber . using oh as a tracer of the molecular hydrogen results in a column density of n@xmath113 of @xmath116 @xmath12 for the txs 0218 + 357 @xcite .",
    "however , while the evidence for significant molecule enrichment in the ism in the txs 0218 + 357 qas is undisputed , the evidence for or against silicate crystallinity is much less clear due to the low s / n of our data .",
    "the combination of a lower flux density , fewer exposures , and a smaller total exposure time for the txs 0218 + 357 quasar , in comparison with pks 1830 - 211 @xcite , makes it much more difficult to establish the presence or absence of silicate crystallinity .",
    "as discussed in  [ results ] the laboratory amorphous olivine laboratory template for the txs 0218 + 357 system provides a good fit , both in terms of the breadth and depth of the 10 and 18  @xmath1 silicate absorption features , and in terms of the peak absorption wavelength .",
    "however , as illustrated in figure  [ singlefit ] , the magnitude of the substructure in the 10 and 18  @xmath1 regions for some species of crystalline olivine and pyroxene are small enough to be masked by the large uncertainties and noise associated with our spectrum .",
    "several of the predicted substucture features align relatively well with the possibly noise features present in our data . furthermore ,",
    "as established with the two - mineral fits in  [ twofitsect ] , a combination of crystalline olivine and pyroxene would produce an excellent match to the 10  @xmath1 and 18  @xmath1 silicate absorption features ; the predicted abundant substructure would occur at levels below that of the noise in the data .",
    "thus , although the smooth , featureless amorphous olivine fit is both consistent with the ism seen in the milky way and with our data , we can not rule out that abundant silicate crystallinity _ could _",
    "be present in the txs 0218 + 357 , although it seems less likely than in the pks 1830 - 211 z=0.886 qas .",
    "if the explanation that the txs 0218 + 357 qas is produced by amorphous olivines is adopted , it establishes a similarity between the silicate dust in this z=0.685 galaxy and that in the milky way ism .",
    "by contrast , independent of the substructure , the redder peak wavelength of the absorption feature in the pks 1830 - 211 z=0.886 qas implies silicate dust grain differences with that in the milky way ism and with that in the txs 0218 + 357 qas ism . in combination",
    ", these data suggest that there could be significant variations in the dust grain properties between different galaxies , which may not be a simple function of redshift evolution or of molecular gas abundance .",
    "further investigation of the silicate dust grains in the txs 0218 + 357 with higher spectral resolution and s / n data , as well as a study of a broader sample of qass , is required to quantify these variations and establish whether ism silicate dust grain crystallinity varies between galaxies as a function of composition , star - formation rate , or redshift .",
    "such studies may be possible within the next decade using new facilities such as _ sofia _ and _ jwst - miri_.",
    "in summary , we find clear evidence of 10  @xmath1 and 18  @xmath1 silicate absorption in the txs 0218 + 357 qas . this shape and peak wavelength of these absorption features appears to be best represented by an amorphous olivine template , with a measured peak optical depth of @xmath117 , although we can not rule out the possibility of substructure originating in crystalline silicates in the relatively poor s / n data .",
    "a quantitative assessment of the silicate crystallinity in this system will require higher s / n data and detection of longer - wavelength mid - ir crystalline resonance features .",
    "fits using amorphous pyroxene and sic templates poorly matched the observed silicate absorption profile for the txs 0218 + 357 qas .",
    "the derived optical depth is significantly higher than that found for other qass , although the rest - frame mg  ii equivalent width and the optical depth of the 21-cm absorption are within the range of values observed for the other program qass .",
    "this may suggest that the silicate dust in the txs 0218 + 357 system is not accompanied by a substantial enhancement in gas .",
    "we also find that while the reddening in the txs 0218 + 357 system is higher than in other qass , it is not as high as the large optical depth would predict , given an extrapolation between these two parameters based on milky way diffuse clouds .",
    "this may suggest variations in the silicate dust grain properties between different galaxies , which can be investigated further with larger samples .",

    "in order to determine the effect on our conclusions of variations in the adopted underlying quasar continuum shape , we explore in this appendix alternative quasar continuum normalizations .      the third order chebyshev polynomial fit we adopt in our analysis was selected because it visually provided the best match to the quasar continuum shape .",
    "we also explored 22 other fits to the continuum , produced by linear , power law , third order chebyshev polynomial , and cubic spline fits .",
    "we found that all of the fits were similar near 10  @xmath1 , while there were variations in the more poorly constrained 18  @xmath1 region because of the paucity of data at @xmath11821  @xmath1 .",
    "we summarize in table  [ contin ] the two most dissimilar fits over the silicate features .",

    "the first normalization ( altnorm1 ) uses a third order chebyshev polynomial like the fiducial fit , but rejects several additional points at @xmath11920  @xmath1 which produces a shallower and slightly narrower 18  @xmath1 absorption feature . the second normalization ( altnorm2 ) is a weighted linear fit , excluding the regions associated with the 10  @xmath1  silicate feature ( 8.5 - 12.5  @xmath1 ) and the 18  @xmath1 feature ( 16.5 - 20.4  @xmath1 ) , and results in a slightly deeper and broader 18  @xmath1 feature .",
    "the differences in the 10  @xmath1  region are minimal for both normalizations .",
    "the shallower 18  @xmath1 feature would have a rest - frame equivalent width of 0.85@xmath40.26 ( a 3.3@xmath2 detection ) , while the the broader feature would have a larger rest - frame equivalent - width of 1.53@xmath40.35 ( a 4.4@xmath2 detection ) . as previously discussed , if the feature extends redward of our data , these are lower limits .",
    "for these 2 alternative quasar continuum normalizations , we repeated the fitting described in  [ results ] .",
    "we did not alter the @xmath48 minimization region in the fitting , although the breadth of the features vary slightly between the continuum normalizations .",
    "we found that when fitting over the 10  @xmath1 region alone the alternative quasar continuum normalizations had a small impact on the derived peak optical depth .",
    "for both normalizations we again obtained that the amorph.oliv.gpc template produced the best fit .",
    "the measured peak optical depth for this fit was @xmath120 for the altnorm1 normalization and @xmath121 for the altnorm2 normalization . while these are both slightly lower than the measured @xmath68 peak optical depth obtained using the fiducial normalization , they are consistent within 1.5@xmath2 .",
    "we illustrate in figure  [ norm - fig4 ] these fits over only the 10  @xmath1 feature in the left two panels , with the am.oliv.gpc template fit shown in red .",
    "when we extended the fitting region to cover both the 10  @xmath1 and 18  @xmath1 features , the differences in the quasar continuum normalization were more significant .",
    "the shallower 18  @xmath1 feature in the altnorm1 normalization results in a 10:18  @xmath1 optical depth ratio that is more consistent with considered crystalline pyroxene templates than with those for amorphous olivine .",
    "furthermore , using the best - fitting minerals , the derived peak optical depth for the 10  @xmath1 feature was found to be deeper than derived for the fiducial fit : @xmath122 versus the fiducial normalization fit of @xmath69 , as shown in table  [ fits-10 + 18-apb ] .",

    "<S> we report the detection of interstellar silicate dust in the z@xmath0=0.685 absorber along the sightline toward the gravitationally lensed blazar txs 0218 + 357 . using </S>",
    "<S> _ spitzer space telescope _ _ infrared spectrograph _ data we detect the 10  @xmath1 silicate absorption feature with a detection significance of 10.7@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we fit laboratory - derived silicate dust profile templates obtained from literature to the observed 10  @xmath1 absorption feature , and find that the best single - mineral fit is obtained using an amorphous olivine template with a measured peak optical depth of @xmath3=0.49@xmath40.02 , which rises to @xmath50.67@xmath40.04 if the covering factor is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we also detected the 18  @xmath1 silicate absorption feature in our data with a @xmath63@xmath2 significance . </S>",
    "<S> due to the proximity of the 18  @xmath1 absorption feature to the edge of our covered spectral range , and associated uncertainty about the shape of the quasar continuum normalization near 18  @xmath1 , we do not independently fit this feature . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , that the shape and depth of the 18  @xmath1  silicate absorption are well - matched to the amorphous olivine template prediction , given the optical depth inferred for the 10  @xmath1 feature . </S>",
    "<S> the measured 10  @xmath1 peak optical depth in this absorber is significantly higher than those found in previously studied quasar absorption systems . </S>",
    "<S> the reddening , 21-cm absorption , and velocity spread of mg  ii are not outliers relative to other studied absorption systems , however </S>",
    "<S> . this high optical depth may be evidence for variations in dust grain properties in the ism between this and the previously studied high redshift galaxies . </S>"
