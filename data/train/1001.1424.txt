    "extinction in galaxies affects their observed properties .",
    "ideally it should be taken into account when inferring the intrinsic properties of the galaxies .",
    "one empirical approach in studying extinction in disk galaxies is to compare the observed properties of objects with similar intrinsic properties at different inclination @xcite .",
    "optically thin galaxies , when inclined , should show higher surface - brightness than their face - on counterparts because of a larger column of stars observed in a smaller projected area on the sky .",
    "this approach has been adopted into various analyses by many authors to study extinction in disk galaxies .",
    "recently , there are revived interests on the topic of extinction because of the large sample of galaxies made available by various sky surveys including the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "progress has been made in studying extinction in galaxies empirically by using techniques that are depend on or independent of the inclination - related approach .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the inclination dependency of dust extinction in disk - dominated galaxies from the sdss , by using the @xmath9-band extinction - band extinction was estimated by @xcite who used the difference between the colors from the stellar population model and from the measurement , and extrapolation to the @xmath9-band assuming a standard extinction curve . ] , and an inclination measure being the apparent major to minor axes ratio .",
    "@xcite applied the technique of occulting galaxy pairs @xcite to 83 sdss spiral disk galaxies in in probing the opacity of the foreground galaxies , and found that the optical depths ( @xmath10 ) in the @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3bands are typically within the range @xmath11 across the disk from approximately @xmath12 to @xmath13  half - light radii ( @xmath14 , in their figure  6 ) .",
    "@xcite looked at disk - dominated galaxies from the sdss and found that the highly inclined objects ( @xmath15 ) exhibit @xmath16  mag extinction correction relative to the face - on magnitude .",
    "@xcite studied the observed photometric properties of the sdss galaxies as a function of inclination , and concluded that the inclination - dependent extinction correction in the @xmath2  band could reach @xmath16  mag with a median value of 0.3  mag for a sample of disk galaxies .",
    "@xcite applied the inclination - corrected magnitudes to the context of galaxy classification .",
    "@xcite developed a sophisticated approach to derive iteratively the extinction - inclination relation for both the bulge and disk components of disk galaxies , and found that the edge - on to face - on relative extinction is @xmath17  mag and @xmath18  mag , respectively for the bulge and the disk .",
    "this is an unique approach to date to simultaneously perform the bulge - to - disk decomposition and derive the extinction - inclination relation for both components .    inspired by these studies , and that the sdss provides for us a large sample of galaxy spectra within a fixed central 3-diameter fiber , and that the calibration of the spectra is independent of that in the sdss photometric data used by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we now investigate if there is any inclination dependency in the observed galaxy spectra ; and what is its wavelength dependency , e.g. , the effect in the gaseous component , such as the region , vs. that in the stellar continuum ; and the comparison of extinctions among different elements .",
    "our approach is to explore the inclination dependency of composite spectra of star - forming disk galaxies in a well defined volume - limited sample that exhibits a flat distribution of the galaxy inclination .",
    "the volume - limited nature of the sample eliminates the malmquist bias in the analysis . the sample is also selected to exhibit a flat distribution of the inclination angle , so that at a chosen redshift ( @xmath9 ) range , a galaxy of luminosity in a defined range would be observed by the survey , _ independent _ of the inclination angle ( or other properties ) of the galaxy .",
    "it is a very important step because one can then assume randomness in the intrinsic properties of the sampled galaxies .",
    "we further confine ourselves to a sample of a narrow redshift range , so that any difference detected in the observed properties between the two composite spectra at different inclination would not be mainly due to the difference in the redshifts of the galaxies . on the other hand , the composite spectra , or the sample - average spectra ,",
    "are used in an effort to average the variation in the intrinsic properties of the galaxies , as the actual optical depth of individual galaxies depends on detailed properties such as the distribution of dust , gas , and stars , the structure of the galaxies such as the presence of arms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hubble type , etc ..    we introduce the galaxy sample in  [ section : data ] .",
    "we present results on the inclination dependency of composite spectra of the galaxies in  [ section : inclination ] .",
    "we derive the empirical continuum extinction in the sdss @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3   bands in  [ section : extinction ] , the model - based face - on extinction in  [ section : theoreticalmodel ] , and the extinction curve ( the extinction as a function of restframe wavelength ) in  [ section : extcurve ] .",

    "we express the spectra in vacuum wavelengths .",
    "as part of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite spectra are taken with fibers of 3 diameter ( corresponding to 0.18  mm at the focal plane for the 2.5  m , f/5 telescope ) .",

    "we determine the criterion for selecting disk - dominated galaxies with the approach used in @xcite , who characterized that galaxies with exponential radial light profiles fall on the blue sequence in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "based on the full dr5 spectroscopic sample , we define a _ parent sample _ of galaxies at redshifts @xmath19 , which covers the median redshift of the main galaxy sample , about 0.1 @xcite .",
    "the galaxies in the parent sample have fracdev@xmath20  = @xmath21  in the @xmath1  band , where fracdev@xmath20  equals @xmath22 for a pure exponential , and equals @xmath23 for a pure de vaucouleurs light profile as provided by the sdss imaging pipeline @xcite .",

    "both the absolute magnitudes and the colors are k - corrected , and corrected against foreground dust using the milky way dust map @xcite .",
    "two main distributions are discernible in the color - magnitude space , corresponding respectively to the red sequence ( @xmath25 - @xmath1  @xmath26 ) and the blue sequence . based on the parent sample , we determine the appropriate fracdev@xmath20  cut for selecting the blue galaxies by repeatedly narrowing the fracdev@xmath20  range and inspecting the resultant color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "galaxies with fracdev@xmath20  in the range of @xmath27  are fairly smooth in the color - magnitude distribution ( the right of figure  [ fig : psample1_mr_u_r_sdss ] ) , with a contamination by the red galaxies of  ( number ratio of the red sequence to the total ) .",
    "the galaxies with fracdev@xmath20   = @xmath27  are used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the inclination of a galaxy is represented by the ratio between the minor and major axes in the @xmath1  band , expab@xmath20 ( or @xmath28 in this paper for simplicity ) provided by the sdss through fitting each galaxy image with an exponential light profile , arbitrary axis ration and position angles .",
    "apparent axis ratio is shown to be a good measure of the average intrinsic inclination of a sample of galaxies by @xcite , who used the approach as in @xcite to simulate the average relationship between the intrinsic and apparent inclinations in a sample of galaxies of gaussian - distributed intrinsic thickness , intrinsic ellipticity that are observed at different viewing angles .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : psample1_expradr_vs_expabr_vlim_mr_sdss_fracdevr_cut ] for the size of our galaxies ) . ]",
    "based on the parent sample with a constrained fracdev@xmath20   = @xmath27 , several volume - limited samples are constructed by selecting galaxies in narrow ranges of redshift . from these",
    "we seek sample(s ) that exhibit a flat distribution of the galaxy inclination .",
    "we emphasize that this approach is purely empirical but is suitable for our purpose , as such a volume - limited sample with a flat distribution of galaxy inclination is obtained . by the nature of this approach , we neglect the step to _ correct",
    "_ for any possible biases that are likely to exist in the galaxy sample . rather , we resort to the cancellation of all of the possible biases that gives rise to a flat distribution of inclination . in the current context , a biased sample is the one which preferentially includes more face - on than edge - on galaxies , or vice versa .",
    "we summarize three major kinds of biases :    * the flux - limited nature of the sdss  the flux limit in the sdss spectra forbids the inclusion of inclined galaxies that are too dim to be observed at certain redshift . * the use of observed properties in sample selection  the observed properties are presumably dust - attenuated .",
    "the use of the inclination - induced reddened colors would cause a bias against edge - on galaxies .",
    "besides , the bulge - to - total flux ratio ( b / t ) of inclined galaxies was found to decrease because the bulge is more attenuated than the disk , implying the use of observed fracdev@xmath20  ( correlated with b / t ) would cause a bias towards edge - on galaxies . * the bias that is tough to be controlled without further simulation  both the intrinsic thickness of galaxies , and the seeing , would make edge - on galaxies to appear rounder .    the sample selection for studying inclination - dependent galaxy properties is therefore a highly complex issue .",
    "this is exactly why we seek an empirical approach as a pilot study .",
    "naturally future work should be focused on eliminating these biases in the sdss spectroscopic samples that are used for inclination studies .",
    "one possible approach is to derive all of the observed properties of interest that are subjected to both the inclination effects and the selection biases , through empirical relations in the literature and/or simulation .",
    "we may then work backwards to derive the intrinsic properties of these galaxies .    to continue with the sample selection we plot the number distribution of the axis ratio of the galaxies ( @xmath29 ) in figure  [ fig : z1 ] to [ fig : z3 ] .",
    "solely based on redshift cuts and without additional magnitude cuts on top of the survey magnitude limits , we see that at lower redshifts ( figure  [ fig : z1 ] , @xmath9   = @xmath30 ) the face - on galaxies are relatively under - sampled .",
    "conversely , at higher redshifts ( figure  [ fig : z3 ] , @xmath9  = @xmath31 ) the edge - on galaxies are relatively under - sampled .",
    "the upper and lower absolute magnitude limits are illustrated in figure  [ fig : psample1_mr_sdss_redshift_fracdevr_cut ] , as a function of redshift .",
    "as the sdss spectroscopic sample is flux - limited ( @xmath1-band petrosian apparent magnitude brighter than @xmath32  mag ) , we deduce that the lack of edge - on galaxies at higher redshifts is due to the dropping out of the survey apparent magnitude limit for those highly inclined objects . at the redshift of 0.1 ,",
    "the highly inclined objects that are dropped out of the flux - limited survey would be , as inferred from figure  [ fig : psample1_mr_sdss_redshift_fracdevr_cut ] , intrinsically dimmer than @xmath33 - 20 .",
    "conversely , the lack of face - on galaxies at lower redshifts is expected to be related to the interplay among all of the selection biases described previously , causing more edge - on systems to be picked . to understand further this result",
    ", we calculate the average inclination of the galaxies , plotted in the plane of @xmath24  vs. redshift ( figure  [ fig : psample1_mr_sdss_redshift_expab_fracdevr_cut ] ) .",
    "only galaxies at @xmath34 @xmath0  show an average inclination of @xmath35  0.5 , consistent with the expected average inclination of a random sample of galaxies that is unbiased against inclination and the range of the inclination being within 0 and 1 .",
    "this consistency , we note , does not _ prove _ that those galaxies are free of any selection bias .",
    "one such indication is that the average b / a   value for brighter galaxies ( brighter than m@xmath36 - 21 ) is not 0.5 , but 0.65 .",
    "this bias , however , does not affect the average luminosity in each of the composite spectra , because the average luminosity is heavily weighted towards the characteristic luminosity of a galaxy sample and less sensitive to the number of the bright - end objects . besides , our lower absolute magnitude limit , -19.5 , is dimmer than the characteristic magnitudes ( the median @xmath24  ranged from -20.1 to -20.4 for b / a  from 0.1 to 1.0 for galaxies at @xmath37 @xmath0   in figure  [ fig : psample1_mr_sdss_redshift_expab_fracdevr_cut ] ) , meaning that the characteristic luminosity is included in the luminosity distribution .    because the @xmath38 @xmath0  sample is mostly flat in terms of its inclination distribution ( figure  [ fig : z2 ] ) , the relatively small number of nearly edge - on ( @xmath39 ) and nearly face - on ( @xmath40 ) galaxies in figure  [ fig : z2 ] is interpreted to be physical .",
    "discussed by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in an unbiased sample the lack of exactly or nearly face - on galaxies is due to intrinsic ellipticity of the galaxies ( on average @xmath41 in the sdss disk galaxies , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the lack of exactly or nearly edge - on galaxies is due to intrinsic thickness of the galaxy disks .",
    "another factor that may come into play is that the axis ratio b / a  may not be a pure inclination measurement of the disk component only , but of the combined bulge+disk systems which are subjected to the seeing effect .",
    "this factor could explain , e.g. , the lack of edge - on galaxies . in the following ,",
    "we confine ourselves to the galaxies located at redshift @xmath0 , with a corresponding survey absolute magnitude limits of @xmath35  -19.5 to -22  mag  in the @xmath1  band .",
    "finally , only spectroscopically - classified star - forming galaxies are considered , where narrow - line active galactic nuclei are removed from the sample through the line ratios [ ] /h@xmath8   vs. [ ] /h@xmath7   according to the calibration by @xcite . in doing",
    "so the origin of the emission lines of the galaxies considered in the later session , e.g. , the balmer decrement ( h@xmath7/h@xmath8 ) , is well constrained  arise from the region that is excited by the o / b stars .",
    "we take the equivalent widths ( ew s ) of these emission lines as those measured by the sdss , and add a constant restframe stellar absorption of 1.3     to each of the balmer lines @xcite .",
    "each of the involved emission lines is required to be larger than 0.7     in the restframe ew , and is of at least 2@xmath42  detection .",

    "if the reddening induced by the galaxy inclination affects the emissions from the regions of the galaxy in a similar manner as the integrated light from the continuum - generating stars , the measured h@xmath7/h@xmath8   ratio can in - principle depend on the inclination of a galaxy .",

    "firstly , the uncertainty in the luminosity densities of the stellar continuum in each composite is calculated by using @xmath132 , where @xmath111 denotes the uncertainty of a quantity . the uncertainty in each balmer ew is calculated to be @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the region of influence of the emission lines , taken to be around the line center , @xmath135  km  s@xmath60   and @xmath136  km  s@xmath60 , respectively for the emission lines h@xmath7  and h@xmath8 .",
    "finally , the uncertainty in the h@xmath7/h@xmath8  is propagated by using @xmath137 .",
    "examples of the best - fit stellar continua in the vicinity of h@xmath8and h@xmath7   emissions are shown respectively in figure  [ fig : linefit_hbeta ] and figure  [ fig : linefit_halpha ] . using the bruzual and charlot stellar population model and the calzetti dust model , in the bayesian approach the underlying stellar absorption lines are represented obviously in the best - fit continuum .",
    "the inclination dependency of the h@xmath7  and h@xmath8  ew s is shown respectively in figure  [ fig : ha_ew_inclin ] and [ fig : hb_ew_inclin ] , for the sliding window approach ( left figures ) and the bayesian approach ( right figures ) .",
    "the offset between both approaches is @xmath138     for the h@xmath7 , and @xmath139     for the h@xmath8 .",
    "if the stellar absorptions are not taken into account as in the sliding window approach , the h@xmath7/h@xmath8  would be mis - taken to be approximately a factor of 1.5  larger for our galaxies .",
    "the inclination dependency of the measured h@xmath7/h@xmath8  is shown in figure  [ fig : balmerdec_inclin.bayesian.gmean ] , using the geometric mean spectra .",
    "the balmer decrements are also calculated in the median spectra , shown in figure  [ fig : balmerdec_inclin.bayesian.median ] , which is expected to preserve the relative line strengths @xcite .",

    "both plots show that the h@xmath7/h@xmath8   remains fairly constant with inclination  a different behavior from the stellar continuum extinction , which shows inclination dependency .",
    "we adopt the balmer optical depth ( @xmath140 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a measure of the dust reddening from the measured balmer line ratio , as follows    @xmath141    the superscript @xmath142 was used by the authors to indicate that @xmath140 derived from the emission lines h@xmath7   and h@xmath8 .",

    "the face - on extinctions @xmath157 and @xmath158 are taken to be those from the slab model(table  [ tab : extfaceon ] ) .",
    "the @xmath159  depends weakly on the model , because the model - dependency of the face - on extinctions in the two photometric bands is reduced in the subtraction when calculating @xmath159 . if the face - on extinction derived by the screen model is used instead , the points are to be moved toward left horizontally by 0.1  unit   in the plot ( not shown ) , which do not affect the above results qualitatively .",
    "the comparison between the balmer - line and stellar continuum color excess is plotted in figure  [ fig : ebv_balmer_vs_stars_mag_jhn_bayesian ] .",
    "most of the points deviate by more than 1@xmath42  uncertainty from the `` uniform interstellar extinction '' line , the dashed line in each sub - figure which indicates the presence of uniform interstellar extinction in every galaxy of the sample . and , the balmer - line color excess is larger than the continuum color excess .",
    "if we assume the color excesses are related so that @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is a constant , then we find    @xmath162    for our sample .",
    "the constant is calculated using @xmath163 , over all of the inclinations .",
    "the result @xmath164 agrees qualitatively with that by @xcite ( their eqn .  3 , with a proportional constant of @xmath165 ) ,",
    "although our proportional constant is approximately a factor of 2 lower , both values are consistent to 1@xmath42   uncertainty .",
    "we discuss these results in  [ section : nie ] .",
    "our study shows the lack of a correlation between the balmer optical depth and the continuum optical depth , and between the balmer - line color excess and the continuum color excess .",
    "if every galaxy of the sample exhibits uniform interstellar extinction , one would expect @xmath166 at a given inclination .",
    "these results are likely the manifestations of the non - uniform interstellar extinction in at least some of the galaxies in each of the sample .",
    "found also earlier in the regions in the large magellanic cloud , it describes the situation where the optical thickness of the dust in front of the light - emitting regions is not the same across the area being observed on a galaxy . combining with the factor in which the spatial distribution of the star - forming regions can be different ( e.g. ,",
    "clumped and/or patchy ) from that of the continuum - generating stars ( e.g. , low mass stars ) , the measured extinctions in the stars and in the regions thus can be different .",
    "our study provides a determination of the wavelength - dependent extinction in a large and well - defined sample of star - forming disk galaxies , independent from previous works in the literature .",
    "we found that both the luminosity and the steepness of the spectral slope of the composite spectra decrease ( i.e. , extinguished and reddened ) with the inclination of disk galaxies , in a volume - limited sample in @xmath167 @xmath0  and @xmath168 -19.5 to -22  mag   from the sdss dr5 . assuming this effect is mainly due to intrinsic extinction in the galaxies , in the sdss",
    "@xmath2-band the inclined relative to face - on continuum extinctions are found empirically to be 1.2  mag  for highly inclined objects ( @xmath5 0.1 ) .",
    "the derived face - on extinction is model dependent , nonetheless with both the slab and sandwich models giving 0.2  mag   in the @xmath2  band .",
    "the extinction curve shows a variety of extinction , in both the sign and the amplitude , for emission / absorption lines relative to the stellar continuum .",
    "the parameterized extinction curves allow for correcting the observed galaxy continuum against the inclination effect .",
    "the h@xmath7/h@xmath8  does not show dependence with the inclination , and remain fairly constant .",
    "this inclination dependency is different from that in the stellar continuum , suggesting the mechanism and/or the dust configuration responsible for the reddening are different in the region and in the continuum - generating stars .",
    "the color excess @xmath169 at most inclinations , rather than the equality of both . from this",
    "we conclude that at least some of the galaxies exhibit the spatially non - uniform interstellar extinction , possibly caused by the presence of the clumped dust in the vicinity of the region in the galaxies .",
    "the next step is to correct for the observed properties with existing parameter - inclination relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and this work ) , re - select the galaxies , and repeat the analysis .",
    "the convergence of the parameter - inclination relations is essential for ensuring their correctness .",
    "this approach is with reference with @xcite , who developed an iterative approach to derive cosmic mass densities of the bulge , disk and dust components due to disk galaxies , and found converged extinction - inclination relations for those galaxies .",
    "our study also raises several interesting questions .",
    "for example , does the variation of extinction as a function of inclination from our current empirical measurement agree with that by other approaches , such as stellar population synthesis modeling ?",
    "can we build a model to describe the distributions of dust , gas , stars and line - emitting regions , that would explain the relative amount of extinction in the emission / absorption lines and the stellar continuum , to meet the extinction curve ?",
    "can we apply the current analysis to other galaxy types ?",
    "what is the effect of galaxy inclination on photometric redshift , given that the inclination causes a reddening to the colors of a galaxy ?",
    "we will leave these studies to future papers . because our sample selection is well defined in a publicly available data set ,",
