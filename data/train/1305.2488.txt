    "the physics of strong light - matter coupling has been attracting a great deal of attention over the last few years . since the early eighties , single atoms",
    "have been coupled to optical and microwave cavities , leading to fundamental demonstrations of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite .",
    "more recently , impressive developments in circuit qed , involving superconducting qubits coupled to microwave cavities  @xcite , atom chips  @xcite , and chip - based microresonators  @xcite have opened the door to the ultra - strong coupling regime , holding the promise to exploit light - matter interaction at the single - photon level in scalable architectures .",
    "this is of pivotal significance for future applications of quantum technologies .    thus far , in typical cavity qed configurations , the atomic properties are considerably changed because the cavity modifies the electromagnetic mode structure as a consequence of the boundaries  @xcite . actually , the radiating atom can excite only one or a few radiation modes  @xcite . in these cases , we can observe spontaneous emission enhancement or inhibition into the modes that are resonant or non - resonant with the cavity , respectively .",
    "the extreme opposite regime of free - space qed , where a continuum of modes are available , has also received notable recognition  @xcite , motivated by the hope of finding simpler solutions for quantum communication over large distances . in these circumstances , it is essential to increase the strength of the light - matter interaction : strongly focused light improves the coupling  @xcite and matching the incoming field with the spatial atomic radiation mode improves focusing  @xcite .",
    "moreover , tailoring the polarization pattern can be significant for achieving near perfect coupling  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing intermediate instance between the single - mode and the continuum limit is the case of a large cavity  @xcite , in which an atom couples to a large but not continuous number of modes . a half - cavity , i.e.",
    ", a cavity with one mirror , constitutes a good example of such a situation  @xcite .",
    "it has been verified experimentally that also in this regime one can witness a change of the density of field modes near an atom which manifests itself in a modified spontaneous photon emission rate  @xcite .",
    "a parabolic cavity is a remarkable example of a half - cavity .",
    "the parabolic shape ensures that light entering parallel to the symmetry axis couples to an atom located at its focus in a particularly efficient way , the light impinging on the atom from all directions  @xcite .",
    "conversely , such a parabola collects the light emitted by an atom in the spontaneous decay in all directions .    in a classical ray picture ,",
    "valid for focal lengths of the parabola large in comparison with the relevant wavelengths of the radiation , only the small fraction of radiation emitted by the atom along the symmetry axis in the direction of the vertex of the parabola is back - reflected towards the atom .",
    "thus , it might seem that the atom scarcely feels the presence of boundaries .",
    "however , this picture is largely oversimplified : if the focal length of the parabola becomes comparable to the relevant radiative wavelengths , diffraction effects become important and significant modifications of the spontaneous emission can be expected . besides , the atom is not a point , but it scatters photons within a region whose linear extension is of the order of the wavelength .",
    "thus , both diffraction and resonant photon scattering by the atom are expected to modify the simple short - wavelength picture substantially .    prompted by the current interest in radiative effects in half - open cavities , we look here into the qed of a two - level atom located at the focus of a parabolic mirror .",
    "first , we find the vector field modes that can couple efficiently to the atom in the dipole approximation . in terms of them",
    ", we study the ensuing modifications of the spontaneous emission as well as the quantum statistical space - time properties of the generated photon .    for that purpose , we develop a semiclassical path representation of probability amplitudes that interpret them as sums of contributions associated with different photon paths inside the parabolic cavity . exploiting in a systematic way the separability of the helmholtz equation in parabolic coordinates , such a representation provides an adequate quantitative description of the spontaneous emission , not only in the short - wavelength limit , but also in the regime of wavelengths comparable or even smaller than the focal length of the parabolic cavity .",
