    "in the pase two decades , the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method has received great success in modeling various fluid systems , and the capability in simulating multiphase flows can be recognized as its unique advantage that distinguishes from the traditional numerical methods  @xcite .",
    "one of most fundamental problems in lb method for multiphase flows is how to describe the interfacial dynamics , which is a natural consequence of intermolecular interactions between different phases . up to now , based on different physical pictures of the interactions , several types of lb multiphase models has been established , which are substantially divided into four categories : the colour model  @xcite , the pseudo - potential model  @xcite , the free - energy model  @xcite and the phase - field based model  @xcite . in most of these lb multiphase models",
    "@xcite , the interface is not tracked explicitly , and the region with non - zero density gradient is identified as the interface . therefore the physics of interface tracking equation is unknown .",
    "fortunately , the phase - field theory provides a firm foundation on the interface physics , in which the interface is tracked by an order parameter that mimics the cahn - hilliard equation ( che )  @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents an order variable , @xmath3 is the mobility coefficient , @xmath4 is the chemical potential and a function of @xmath2 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are related to the interface thickness @xmath8 and surface tension @xmath9 by the relationships @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 in eq.(1 ) is the fluid velocity and governed by the incompressible navier - stokes equations  @xcite    @xmath13    @xmath14 + { { \\bf{f}}_s } + { \\bf{g}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the fluid density , @xmath16 is the pressure , @xmath17 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath18 is the surface tension , and @xmath19 is the external force .    some researchers have constructed some lb multiphase models based on the phase - field theory , where the interface is needed to be tracked explicitly by an index or order distribution function  @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a lb model for incompressible multiphase flows , in which they adopted an index distribution function to track the interface and a pressure distribution function for solving the flow field . based on this model , they successfully simulated the two - dimensional rayleigh - taylor instability , and later the three - dimensional case using d3q15 lattice structure in lb equations for both the interface capturing and flow field  @xcite .",
    "although this model is rather robust , it suffers from some limitations , one of which is that the recovered interface equation is inconsistent with the che noticed by zheng _",
    "_  @xcite . to this end",
    ", they developed a lb model for the che , in which a source term on a spatial difference of the distribution function is introduced  @xcite .",
    "the model is subsequently extended to the three - dimension using d3q7 lattice model  @xcite .",
    "recently , zu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced another similar lb model for the che where a spatial difference term on the equilibrium distribution function was included .",
    "they also modified the equilibrium distribution function in lb equation for flow field such that the continuity equation ( 3a ) can be derived .",
    "however , the computation of the macroscopic pressure and velocity in their scheme is implicit .",
    "more recently , we proposed a novel lb model for two - dimensional multiphase flows  @xcite .",
    "on one hand , a simpler time - dependent source term is incorporated in lb equation for the interface capturing . as a result",
    ", the two - dimensional che can be recovered correctly . on the other hand , a equilibrium distribution function",
    "is delicately designed for flow field to derive the correct continuity equation while the hydrodynamic properties can be computed explicitly .",
    "this improved model is also extended to study axisymmetric multiphase flows  @xcite    as a continuing work , in this paper an efficient three - dimensional lb model for incompressible multiphase flow systems is developed based on the multiple - relaxation - time ( mrt ) method .",
    "this model has some distinct advantages .",
    "firstly , the model for the che requires only seven discrete velocities in three dimensions ( d3q7 ) , therefore the expenditure in data storage and computational time is smaller than that of other models using d3q15 lattice  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the mrt collision model is adopted , which has a better accuracy and stability than the single - relaxation - time ( srt ) model used commonly in other lb multiphase models  @xcite .",
    "finally , the present model is able to deal with fluid flows at a large peclet number or a high reynolds number .",
