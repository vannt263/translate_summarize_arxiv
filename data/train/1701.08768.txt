    "understanding the properties of the massive black holes ( mbhs ) in the centers of low - mass galaxies ( @xmath13 ) is an important way to discriminate observationally between different bh - seed formation scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also unclear whether the well - known scaling relation between the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass and the velocity dispersion of the host - galaxy bulge extends to the low - mass regime ( see ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) , but also see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , our understanding of galaxy evolution remains incomplete without a clear picture of the mbh population in low - mass galaxies .",
    "agn emission powered by accretion onto mbhs in low - mass galaxies is often diluted and/or mimicked by stellar processes in the host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the identification of accreting mbhs in low - mass galaxies is challenging . in practice ,",
    "single - epoch spectroscopic observations at optical wavelengths have been the most - efficient method for reliably finding unobscured agns while also obtaining the estimated virial mass of the mbhs @xcite .",
    "however , this approach requires that agn signatures are clearly visible ( i.e. , not obscured or diluted ) in the optical spectrum .",
    "limited by the luminosity of such mbh accretion and current optical spectroscopic survey limits , most of the optically selected mbh candidates are unobscured agns at low redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath14 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , stacking analyses of high - redshift galaxies in survey regions with deep observations have suggested that many low - mass galaxies harbor emitting nuclei that are heavily obscured @xcite . to date , there are very few known agn residing in low - mass star - forming galaxies in the local universe ( see @xcite for individual examples ) .",
    "this might be due to the fact that observations probing energies @xmath10  kev can suffer from obscuration , as well as could be affected by galaxy dilution due to the low - luminosity nature of mbh accretion @xcite .",
    "therefore , our understanding of selected agn demographics in low - mass galaxies is primarily limited to a few sources from survey regions with deep soft kev energy range as `` soft '' and @xmath15 kev x - rays as `` hard '' . ]",
    "observations ( e - cdf - s , @xcite ; xdeep2 , @xcite ; and amuse , @xcite ) or archival searches @xcite . while there are also a number of soft follow - up observations of mbhs selected using broad emission lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of them are unobscured as a consequence of the optical broad - line selection . furthermore",
    ", @xcite and @xcite have reported that some agns with broad optical emission lines in low - mass galaxies have surprisingly weak @xmath10 kev x - ray emission compared to the expected values from their [ ] and uv luminosities @xcite .    an alternative approach to studying the agn populations hosted by low - mass galaxies",
    "is to observe in hard x - rays since hard photons are much less susceptible to absorption by intervening material .",
    "in addition , recent _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ ( _ nustar _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) studies of two star - forming galaxies have also revealed that the broad - band spectra of galaxies powered by stellar processes are dominated by @xmath16 kev plasma emission at @xmath17 kev and a steep ( @xmath18 ) power - law component at @xmath19 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "notably , the power - law component of some of the most luminous ulxs ( ultra luminous x - ray sources ) could have photon - indicies similar to those of agns ( e.g. , @xmath20 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the combination of hard observations from _ nustar _  and high angular resolution data from ancillary soft observations can provide the means to distinguish the emission originating from mbhs vs. other off - nuclear stellar processes . constructing a _ nustar_-selected agn sample hosted by low - mass galaxies",
    "could provide a critical step to understanding the low - mass agn population .",
    "low - mass agns detected by previous hard observatories are scarce due to the limited sensitivity and angular resolution of the previous generation of instruments .",
    "even with the all - sky coverage of the  survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the number of low - mass agns is small , and the low - mass agns detected by  primarily are comprised of nearby ( @xmath21 ) or luminous ( @xmath22 erg s@xmath6 ) sources that might not be representative of low - mass agns generally .",
    "the recently launched _",
    "observatory provides a @xmath23 times improvement in hard sensitivity over previous observations at @xmath24 kev .",
    "one of the first ten   detections in the serendipitous survey @xcite has already been identified as an agn hosted by a dwarf galaxy ( @xmath25 ) . in this work ,",
    "we report the properties of low - mass galaxies detected in the  serendipitous - survey catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* l17 hereafter ) , aiming to improve our understanding of the hard emitting agn population hosted by low - mass galaxies .",

    "the uncertainties reported in this work are @xmath30 unless stated otherwise .",
    "to date , the _ nustar _  serendipitous survey ( l17 ) has covered an area of @xmath3113 deg@xmath32 and detected @xmath33 individual sources . the serendipitous survey is the largest - area component of the extragalactic survey program .",
    "this program searches for serendipitous detections in most of the _ nustar _  pointings . in short ,",

    "we note that 15 of the 248 sources do not have ancillary soft observations . for these objects , we use a searching radius of @xmath39 around the _ nustar _  positions to search for their optical counterparts . based on visual inspection of the optical images",
    ", we reject seven of the 15 objects with multiple optical and infrared counterparts within the search radius to avoid potentially spurious matching results .",

    "113 of the 248 objects are covered in the imaging footprint of sdss , and all of these objects have optical photometry in the _ u , g , r , i , z _ bands . to measure accurately the host - galaxy color and luminosity , we adopt the extinction - corrected model magnitudes that are scaled to the _ i_-band c - model magnitude from sdss dr12 @xcite .    for the 135 objects outside of the sdss imaging footprint , the optical photometry was obtained from supercosmos , which is considered to have 0.3 mag photometric uncertainties .",
    "near - ir constraints for our sample come from the _ j , h _ , and _ ks _ band photometric catalog of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
