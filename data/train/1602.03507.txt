    "is the same thermodynamic analysis possible far from equilibrium ?",
    "a central issue in nonequilibrium physics is whether thermodynamics can be extended to systems far from equilibrium , in particular , to steady states @xcite .",
    "a key thermodynamic concept is phase coexistence ; indeed , one of the principal applications of equilibrium thermodynamics is the prediction of phase coexistence based upon knowledge of the isolated phases .    while there has been much study of nonequilibrium statistical systems and their associated phase transitions@xcite , the issue of coexistence between far - from - equilibrium phases remains largely unexplored .",
    "instances of phase separation in nonequilibrium steady states have been known for some time , for example in the driven lattice gas with attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "it appears to have been assumed , implicitly , that nonequilibrium phase coexistence is well defined .",
    "equilibrium phase coexistence enjoys a high degree of universality .",
    "that is , if phases a and b with different densities , for example , are known to coexist when present in a single nonuniform system , ( e.g. , as a result of phase separation ) , then they must also coexist if a pair of uniform systems , prepared in phases a and b , are permitted to exchange particles and/or energy across a fixed boundary . here",
    "i show , via explicit examples , that which nonequilibrium phases actually coexist depends upon how they make contact , that is , on how they are permitted to exchange particles .",
    "thus , far from equilibrium , the universality associated with equilibrium phase coexistence is lost .",
    "equilibrium statistical mechanics has established a very general notion of  phase \" in terms of gibbs measures @xcite ; since such a formalism is not available far from equilibrium , i revert to simple operational definitions .",
    "i consider systems maintained out of equilibrium by a steady drive acting on the particles , or via contact with two reservoirs having different temperatures .",
    "the condition maintaining the system away from equilibrium is called a _ drive _ ; the drive provokes a flux of energy and/or matter through the system .",
    "a nonequilibrium phase corresponds to a macroscopic state of a system under a drive , having time - independent , reproducible properties that vary smoothly with the drive intensity and the external parameters ( such as temperature and chemical potential ) associated with the reservoir or reservoirs in contact with the system .",
    "if the macroscopic properties depend in a singular manner on the drive or other external parameters , the system is said to suffer a ( nonequilibrium ) phase transition .    now consider two systems in nonequilibrium steady states , subject to the same drive and external parameters , but with distinct , spatially uniform macroscopic properties .",
    "the systems represent coexisting phases if , when allowed to exchange energy or matter , the net flux of the quantity or quantities they may exchange is zero .",
    "nonequilibrium phase coexistence emerges spontaneously at _ phase separation _ , in which , varying some external parameter , a homogeneous phase becomes unstable , yielding a new stable steady state containing distinct macroscopic phases separated by a sharp interface .",
    "( the coexisting phases are clearly free to exchange particles and energy in this situation . )",
    "the stochastic particle system known as the driven lattice gas with attractive interactions ( or katz - lebowitz - spohn ( kls ) model @xcite ) provides a simple realization of phase separation far from equilibrium .",
    "the drive ( which favors particle motion along a certain axis ) , tends to increase the potential energy ; to maintain a steady state , energy flows from the particle system to a reservoir at a certain temperature @xmath0 . at high temperatures ,",
    "the state with uniform density is stable , but ( in two or more dimensions ) below a certain value of @xmath0 , the system segregates into high- and low - density phases separated by a narrow interface , much as its equilibrium counterpart ( equivalent to the ising model with fixed total magnetization ) undergoes phase separation .",
    "the high- and low - density regions relax to a state in which their macroscopic properties are time - independent , despite the presence of the drive .",
    "these  empirical \" facts about the model ( known from extensive numerical simulations ) provide an unambiguous example of coexisting nonequilibrium phases .",
    "suppose a pair of coexisting phases , a and b , are found in a driven , phase - separated system , and that we prepare uniform systems with the same macroscopic properties ( such as density ) , as observed in phases a and b , respectively , subject to the same drive and external parameters as in the phase - separated system .",
    "we may now ask :    \\1 .",
    "are the isolated uniform phases a and b stable ?",
    "if they are stable , and are allowed to exchange particles and/or energy , will they coexist ?    in equilibrium ,",
    "the stability and coexistence of the uniform phases ( given their coexistence under phase separation ) , is so  obvious \" that the corresponding questions have hardly been explored , far from equilibrium .",
    "i investigate these questions in the context of two far - from - equilibrium models : the kls model mentioned above , and a two - temperature lattice gas .",
    "precise definitions of the models are given below .",
    "in the present study , the transition rates for particle exchange between ( potentially ) coexisting phases are taken as sasa - tasaki ( st ) rates @xcite , which depend on the interaction energy before , but not after , the transition .",
    "i use st rates for two reasons .",
    "first , as argued in @xcite , these rates correspond to thermally - induced transitions over an energy barrier : as in the classic kramers escape problem , the particle can not  know \" the energy landscape on the other side of the barrier .",
    "second , as shown in @xcite , consistent definitions of intensive properties ( temperature , chemical potential ) for the driven system are in general only possible using st rates .",

    "( in most of the studies , @xmath20 . ) in the continuous - time stochastic evolution , each particle is equally likely to be the next to attempt to hop ; hopping is always to a nn site .",
    "if the latter is unoccupied , the particle displacement is accepted with the probabilities defined above . a monte carlo step ( mcs )",
    "corresponds to one attempted move per lattice site ; simulations are run for a total of 1 - @xmath21 mcs , with an initial period of 1 - @xmath22 mcs for relaxation to the steady state .",

    "a preliminary study revealed that phase separation occurs for temperatures @xmath23 .",

    "for present purposes a precise result for @xmath25 is not needed : the only need for an estimate of @xmath25 is to study values well below it , to avoid finite - size effects large fluctuations associated with the critical region .",
    "starting from a random , statistically uniform distribution of particles , the system evolves to a configuration a number of dense stripes separated by rarefied regions : the hallmark of phase separation in the kls model . to minimize interfacial effects and facilitate determination of the coexisting densities ,",
    "i employ a _ single - stripe _ initial configuration in a half - filled system , which relaxes to a stationary state consisting of a single dense and a single rarefied region ( see fig .",

    "profiles taken after only @xmath22 mcs yield densities of 0.9889(2 ) and 0.0450(5 ) , showing that the densities have indeed relaxed to their stationary values .",

    "all profiles exhibit well defined bulk regions , in which the density @xmath28 is free of any significant linear trend or curvature ; the bulk regions are separated by interfaces . to decide",

    "weak exchange corresponds to the limit @xmath43 .",
    "important consequences of weak exchange are : ( 1 ) the systems in contact are statistically independent ; ( 2 ) particle exchange does not provoke spatial inhomogeneities within these systems ; ( 3 ) under weak global exchange using st rates , it is possible to associate a temperature and a chemical potential with _ spatially uniform _",
