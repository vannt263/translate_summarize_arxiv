    "the ncss are classified as unconventional superconductors with broken is while a substantial part of superconductors has this symmetry .",
    "the is is most commonly broken by the presence of a soc .",
    "let us confine our attention to the two dimensions , i.e. @xmath3 as the wavevector of the superconducting electrons in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "since the parity and the spin are not conserved , i.e. the ops can simultaneously accommodate an even singlet @xmath5 and an odd triplet @xmath6 .",
    "the full @xmath7 pair potential in the spinor basis is then given by @xmath8 and the connection is made with the singlet and triplet ops by @xmath9/2 $ ] , @xmath10/2 $ ] , @xmath11/(2i)$ ] and @xmath12/2 $ ] .",
    "here , we choose the spin quantization axis perpendicular to the @xmath4 plane .",

    "the pauli exchange requires @xmath20 under the exchange of paired fermions .",
    "when these symmetries are both manifested , an important result follows that @xmath5 and @xmath21 are both real .    the smoking gun of the unconventional pairing in a ncs is usually considered as the nodes of the pair potential@xcite . the nodal structure can most simply be represented in two dimensions in the angular momentum-@xmath22 basis as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are angular momentum basis functions describing the anisotropy@xcite with @xmath27 .",
    "here @xmath28 are defined as the ops for each partial component @xmath29 which will be elaborated below .    in two dimensions as we consider here , we represent the is breaking by the soc vector @xmath30 with @xmath31 as the soc constant .",
    "the nodes in the pair potential are represented by a ) discrete set of points , i.e. point nodes ( pns ) , and b ) closed or open line nodes in the @xmath32 space .",
    "the excitation spectra are symmetric around all trs - invariant points such as @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is some lattice parameter .",
    "note that , in strongly anisotropic compounds with the tetragonal symmetry @xmath36 , these are special points supported by the center and the boundaries of the brillouin zone .",
    "furthermore , under manifested trs , the excitation spectra are kramers degenerate @xmath37 with @xmath38 describing different branches split by the broken is .",
    "pns can occur at these trs - invariant points or , in the case of weyl points they may occur at arbitrary values in a finite number of trs pairs@xcite .",
    "in addition to the pns in strongly anisotropic two dimensional ncss , a common type is the angular line node ( aln ) . in tetragonal systems , the nodes can be formed along @xmath39 or @xmath40 or @xmath41 . in low temperatures ,",
    "alns are evidenced by integer scaling exponents in the specific heat and this has been observed in a number of highly anisotropic ncss@xcite among which are the celebrated trs preserving @xmath42 and the trs breaking @xmath43 . in the presence of alns , the london penetration depth , heat conductivity and ultrasound attenuation all scale with integer exponents .",
    "however other experiments also exist where alns can not sufficiently explain the thermodynamic data@xcite and , despite this large number of experimental and theoretical studies , a one - to - one connection between the scaling behaviour and the existence of nodes is missing .",
    "it is remarkable that the anisotropy , strong electronic correlations and the nodes are common topics that are usually discussed together@xcite . for the spin singlet - triplet",
    "mixed ncss with a specific point group symmetry , let us consider the leading terms in the angular momentum expansion .",
    "for the tetragonal case these terms are the @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and the @xmath46-wave ( @xmath47 ) components in the singlet @xmath48 and the @xmath49 and the @xmath50-wave components of the triplet @xmath51 .",
    "the mixed state pairing potential @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the band splitting due to the broken is , is directly responsible for opening an energy gap at the fermi level as well as giving rise to a topological band structure . here",

    "is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 are @xmath61 components respectively .",
    "the alns are obtained in the strongly anisotropic case of @xmath62 in the small wavelength limit .",
    "specifically , this is the regime where the effect of the short range electronic correlations in the form of sdws , cdws or fermi surface nesting become important . on the other hand , in the other extreme case of weak anisotropy",
    "the nodes are dominated by the first term in eq.([anisotrop - isotrop_pairing ] ) where they are closed lines encircling the origin .",
    "the extreme limits of anisotropy is therefore determined by the leading term being @xmath63 or @xmath64 in eq.([anisotrop - isotrop_pairing ] ) . since the magnitude of the second term",
    "is limited by @xmath65 , we use a simple model where @xmath66 is constant and @xmath63 is given by the profile in fig.[aln_to_rln].(a ) . using this @xmath63 in eq.([anisotrop - isotrop_pairing ] ) , the change from the fully isotropic rlns to the strongly anisotropic alns can be studied as @xmath67 is changed",

    "this important point is where our motivation resides in this work .",
    "we believe that the results of our work are relevant to some of the experiments where the effect of the lattice symmetry on the electronic system is weak .",

    "reversely thinking , investigating the line nodes in a large range of anisotropy can provide us with hints in understanding the mechanisms behind the unconventional pairing .",

    "this hints to the fact that , the analysis of such systems can be highly confusing using the thermodynamic data and we believe that this section provides an explanation to this contraversy .",
    "the section 3.3 is devoted to the scattering properties of rlns at the n - ncs junctions . in this context",
    ", we examine the andreev reflection spectroscopy ( ars ) and show that ars provides a suitable method to capture the distinct signatures of the weakly anisotropic systems .",
    "we start with a two dimensional ncs respecting trs and a general pairing interaction generates the singlet and the triplet components of the pair potential under a soc .",
    "a crucial aspect is that , it is a continuum model which is maximally isotropic and no lattice point group symmetry is assumed .",

    "at this point we emphasize that , one of our motivations in studying the weak anisotropy conditions has something to do with the relation between the @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "it was shown a long time ago in ref.@xcite that @xmath103 yields the thermodynamically most stable configuration with the highest possible @xmath2 .",

    "is that @xmath108 and @xmath103.@xcite the eq.([spectrum ] ) can then be expressed in a generalized bcs form as@xcite @xmath109 } \\label{generalized_bcs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the branch index of the broken is and @xmath110 are the single particle energy and the momentum dependent pair potential respectively with @xmath111 the energy branches with @xmath53 in eq.([generalized_bcs ] ) can have different fermi surfaces with a different gap opening at the fs as @xmath112 .",
    "the bands are in mutual thermodynamical equilibrium by the presence of a single chemical potential , hence the fermi level can occur at multiple positions in the @xmath56-space .",
    "together with the nodes of @xmath113 , this can give rise to a topological variety .",
    "the mean field hartree - fock solutions of the mixed state ops in eq.([ops ] ) can be given in the symmetric form as , @xmath114 @xmath115 where @xmath116 $ ] is the fermi - dirac factor with @xmath117 as the inverse temperature .",
    "the singlet and the esp - triplet ops in eq.s([singlet ] ) and ( [ esp ] ) are determined by the corresponding interaction channels @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "specifically , @xmath120 and @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the angular average over the relative phase @xmath123 . in consequence , a bare contact interaction , i.e. @xmath124 is insufficient to create pairing in the triplet channel even in the presence of a strong soc .",
    "the term @xmath125 in eq.([esp ] ) is proportional to the difference between the two energy branches .",
    "however , a similar term in eq.([singlet ] ) represents the sum of the same contributions in @xmath126 .",
    "a non - local pairing interaction and the soc are therefore essential factors in the @xmath56-dependence of the ops in the mixed state .",
    "this affects most importantly the rln positions , the topology of the energy bands and the low temperature properties as discussed below .",
    "in general , whether point or line , the nodes can be present in two distinct levels : a ) the pair potential @xmath127 and b ) the energy spectrum @xmath128 .    in strongly anisotropic ncss the singlet and the triplet configurations are permitted by the crystal point group symmetries .",
    "this allowed the development of group theoretical models in the general classification of the alns and the energy band topology .",
    "a recent review@xcite can be very useful for a complete summary in this respect .",
    "on the other hand , in the weakly anisotropic ncss the point groups are ineffective and the alns are absent .",
    "however , these materials can still display puzzling low temperature behaviour@xcite , i.e. some ncss with strong spin - orbit coupling display a fully gapped s - wave behaviour in thermodynamical response . in this work",
    "we bring an explanation to this conflict and show that the rlns in the pair potential can simulate an isotropic s - wave superconductor .",
    "a fully gapped spectrum is present when the rln positions are away from the fermi surface , that is the case ( a ) above .",
    "more precisely , these type of nodes are topologically classified according to their position with respect to the fermi surface",
    ". they can be most accurately identified by the arpes@xcite , andreev reflection spectroscopy@xcite or other ingenious measurements@xcite .",
    "if an rln is on the fermi surface , there is a gappless spectrum and the case ( b ) occurs , i.e. the energy nodes in @xmath128 . because of this additional fermi surface matching condition , these nodes are physically rare , but when they occur , they dominate the low temperature thermodynamic behaviour@xcite .",
    "hence , a concise analysis of rlns is necessary , which we do next .      in this section",
    "we demonstrate that the rlns topology is encoded in the position of the nodes and their nodal positions can , in principal , be externally controlled .",
    "this result is important from the future device applications , as experimental progress in this direction can lead us to the topologically controllable systems .",
    "the angular line nodes are , on the other hand , much less flexible externally due to the dominant effect of the crystal symmetries .",
    "we now carry on a topological analysis using two different methods and demonstrate that the topology is determined by the positions of the rlns .",
    "\\a ) _ the block - diagonal hamiltonian method _ : in the absence of the @xmath129 type pairing , the mixed state hamiltonian in eq.([h_matrix ] ) can be block - diagonalized in the soc eigenbasis @xmath130 where @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "each block is described by a @xmath7 matrix in the form written by @xmath133 with @xmath134 as the pauli matrices in the soc basis and @xmath135 .",
    "one way to examine the energy band topology of rlns is then to investigate each block - diagonal branch separately by the two - dimensional mapping @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the hamiltonian unit sphere .",

    "this requires that the configurations where @xmath225 or @xmath226 are topologically undefined . since these specific configurations are where the energy gap closes , we have the important result that , an rln in the energy spectrum occurs at the boundary of two distinct topological regions",
    "this concludes our discussion on the topology of the rlns .",
    "we now investigate the influence of the rlns on the thermodynamic observables where the results of the section 3.1 will also be used .      in fully gapped ncss , specific heat , penetration depth and other thermodynamic observables display exponential suppression in temperature in sufficiently low temperatures . for this reason , it is difficult in thermodynamic experiments to separate the unconventional pairing in these systems from the fully gapped trivial s - wave superconductors .",
    "on the other hand , the gapless superconductors -mostly studied in the context of alns in the anisotropic regime- can be easily identified in thermodynamical measurements with their distinct scaling behaviour near vanishing excitation energies . in this case , the exponential suppression in temperature is replaced by a clean power law depending on the nodal dimensions .",
    "it is known that in two dimensional systems , the point nodes can yield in the specific heat a @xmath227 , whereas the alns yield a @xmath228 dependence@xcite .",
    "+ 0.2truecm    [ fp ]    it is our goal in this section to show that , the weakly anisotropic systems where alns are not present , behave thermodynamically like the ordinary s - wave superconductors .",
    "this is so even in the presence of strongly mixed singlet - triplet components with rlns present in the pair potential .",
    "in order to study the thermodynamics of these systems , we start with the energy dos of the branch @xmath68 , @xmath229 and examine its behaviour in the context of sec.3.1 .",
    "we consider @xmath128 in the context of eq.([generalized_bcs ] ) and ( [ kinetic1 ] ) also allowing the pair potential to have a simple rln at @xmath164 , i.e. @xmath230 . if we concentrate on the region @xmath231 for a fixed @xmath68 and @xmath232 , then @xmath233 . here",
    "@xmath234 and @xmath235 are some coefficients .",
    "we find that @xmath236 and @xmath237 is where @xmath238 .",
    "the eq.([dos2 ] ) indicates that , for large energies @xmath239 .",
    "the small energy limit of dos depends on whether a zero energy mode at a finite @xmath56 is supported in the spectrum .",
    "for the zero energy mode @xmath240 must be physically realized , i.e. the node in the pair potential must occur at the fermi level . in this case ,",
    "eq.([dos1 ] ) implies that in the vicinity of the zero mode @xmath241 , i.e. a constant . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath242 , there is a gap in the spectrum for @xmath243 with a divergent dos at the gap edge .",
    "the dos for this @xmath244 case is summarized in fig.[transition_to_from_scaling].(a ) . before commenting on this case ,",
    "we examine the dos for @xmath174 . here",
    ", there are two fermi surface positions or none .",
    "let us assume that there can be one rln of the pair potential at @xmath164 for each branch @xmath68 . in this case , there can be two , one or zero number of energy nodes and the picture obtained for the @xmath177 case in the dos is repeated here according to the number of energy nodes .",
    "finally , the dos for @xmath174 is shown in fig.[transition_to_from_scaling].(b ) .    in fig.s [ transition_to_from_scaling].(a ) and ( b ) ,",
    "the behaviour of the dos in the fully gapped regimes is unseparable from a conventional s - wave superconductor .",
    "different behaviour from the conventional superconductor appears when the node is located on the fermi surface .",
    "this corresponds to an rln in the energy spectrum and in contrast to the alns where @xmath245 with @xmath15 being an integer exponent depending on dimensionality@xcite , here the dos acquires a constant value .",
    "a comparison with the previous section shows that , the point where the discontinuous jump occurs in @xmath246 is a boundary between topologically two distinct regimes . the experimental observation of this discontinuity should be considered as a significant evidence about the presence of rlns and , any thermodynamic quantity based on @xmath247 is expected to have this signature . for instance the specific heat given by @xmath248 where @xmath249 was define before , displays a sharp transition from the exponential suppression to the linear dependence as shown in fig.[transition_to_from_scaling].(c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath250 in an ncs with rlns is therefore very similar to that of the @xmath44-wave bcs superconductor .",
    "this is a crucial information which may be useful in resolving some of the experimental controversies .",
    "indeed , recently a number of thermodynamic experiments were reported on ncss with strong is breaking@xcite and the list is rapidly extending@xcite . in these works ,",
    "the thermodynamic data is similar to fig.[transition_to_from_scaling].(c ) and ( d ) and the opinion of those authors is in favour of the conventional s - wave bcs superconductivity . on the other hand ,",
    "other evidences were also emphasized therein pointing at the unconventional pairing .",
    "our results in this section can demonstrate that a fully gapped superconductor with an rln located off the fermi surface can display thermodynamic data like ordinary s - wave superconductors at the same time being topologically unconventional in a strongly mixed state .",
    "an important side remark is that , if @xmath55 changes sign between the two fermi wavevectors @xmath251 and @xmath252 , then both gaps @xmath253 are allowed to have rlns .",
    "this case is interesting but certainly a very rare circumstance",
    ". its experimental identification may be difficult to reveal in thermodynamic measurements , but it may be possible by ars which we discuss next .      the arguments raised above show that the thermodynamic data can be misleading in understanding the op symmetry .",
    "we furthermore demonstrated that , the rlns offer an explanation to these controversies and they are most likely present in weakly anisotropic systems .",
    "we can differentiate the strongly anisotropic conditions from the weakly anisotropic ones , for instance as shown in the top and the bottom slices of fig[aln_to_rln].(b ) , by using probes that can control the energy and the momentum vector at the single particle level .",
    "the andreev conductance ( ac ) measurements have been useful experimental tools for obtaining information about the pairing symmetry of the s , d and chiral p - wave superconductors.@xcite in this section , we demonstrate that the ac can be also an efficient probe for the weakly anisotropic ones .",
    "we consider the junction of a normal metal ( n ) with a weakly anisotropic ncs in the @xmath4 plane and calculate the ac at an n - ncs interface where @xmath254 is the n side without soc and @xmath255 is the ncs with soc . we assume ideal conditions with no interface potential which allows us to discard the normal reflection@xcite .    initially , an electron , spin - polarized in the z - direction , is sent normal to the n - ncs interface from the n side at the wavevector @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the energy of the incident electron and @xmath258 is the chemical potential in the n region with @xmath259 being the fermi wavevector in the n side .",
    "we perform our calculations for the zero voltage bias , i.e. @xmath260 .",
    "the corresponding wavefunctions are @xcite @xmath261 where @xmath262 evaluated at the corresponding transmitted wavevector @xmath263 in eq.s([wf1 ] ) , and for @xmath264 @xmath265 whereas , analogous to the btk theory@xcite , the coefficients are complex for @xmath266 as , @xmath267 and @xmath268 . here",
    "@xmath269 are the complex andreev reflection amplitudes for the hole with wavevector @xmath270 , and the @xmath271 are the normal reflection amplitudes . on the ncs side ,",
    "@xmath272 are the transmission amplitudes within the ncs in the @xmath273 branches . here",
    "@xmath274 as the result of the absence of normal reflection as mentioned before .",
    "hence only @xmath269 are present due to the andreev mechanism .",
    "the pair potential @xmath275 is an isotropic function of @xmath276 in the ncs . due to the homogeneous boundary conditions along the @xmath277-direction , the @xmath278",
    "is conserved across the boundary .",
    "the @xmath275 is therefore a function of @xmath257 of the incident probe particle and its angle of incidence @xmath279 on the @xmath280 side . for normal incidence ,",
    "we take @xmath281 .",
    "this being the case for the perfect isotropy , for weakly anisotropic ncss the pair potential can be a weak function of the orientaton angle @xmath282 of the crystal axes relative to the interface plane in the ncs . in this case",
    ", @xmath275 can be considered as a fuzzy function of @xmath257 with a narrow spread given by the degree of anisotropy . in the isotropic limit",
    ", fuzziness disappears and @xmath283 becomes a sharp function of @xmath257 . assuming this last case and for a given initial energy @xmath257 , there are three different regimes : a ) @xmath284 where @xmath285 and @xmath286 , b ) @xmath287 where @xmath285 and @xmath288 , and c ) @xmath289 where @xmath290 and @xmath288 .",
    "we assumed here that @xmath291 which may or may not be true for all energies [ details are in the caption of fig([andreev_cond ] ) ] .",
    "the results here are unaffected by such details .    the full solution of the coefficients in eq.s([wf1 ] ) , requiring the application of the boundary conditions @xmath292 and @xmath293 at the @xmath294 interface , has been shown in a large number of works and will not be shown here .",

    ". here we will be interested in the double step - like behaviour of the @xmath298 and @xmath299 as a result of the eq.s([step_like_ac_2 ] ) as shown in fig.([andreev_cond ] ) .",

    "the spin dependent andreev reflection and the transmission coefficients are shown in the fig.[andreev_cond].(a - f ) together with the ac @xmath310 calculations in the insets , where the mutual positions of the @xmath311 are varied in ( a , b , d , e ) and one of the pair potentials is assumed to be at the nodal position at @xmath312 in ( c , f ) .",
    "let us concentrate on the inset in fig.[andreev_cond].(a ) where the @xmath308 starts with a plateau at unit conductance corresponding to the configuration @xmath284 , i.e. case ( a ) defined above eq.([step_like_ac_1 ] )",
    ". if @xmath257 is between the gaps , as in case ( b ) , the ac moves down to a second plateau . for the case ( c ) ,",
    "the @xmath308 gradually disappears as @xmath257 is increased .",
    "if the interval @xmath313 is changed , the curves change only quantitatively with the double - step behaviour unchanged [ fig.s[andreev_cond].(b , e ) ] .",
    "we now shift to the second distinct case ( ii ) above , when one of the pair potentials is zero as shown in fig.[andreev_cond].(c , f ) corresponding to a rln position .",
    "the @xmath310 in the inset therein , directly starts at 1/2 at low energies then going through a single plateau before gradually vanishing at high energies .",
    "if this rln is located on the fermi surface , this should experimentally give rise to a narrow zero bias conductance peak .",
    "the double steps in the ac is a signature of the three regions with different andreev reflection properties .",
    "we therefore expect that the two distinct steps should always be present where the other details such as the step length and the vertical range of the steps should be material dependent . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", double steps clearly point at the weak anisotropy , but in reality there can be a weak dependence on the orientation angle @xmath282 in @xmath311 .",
    "this should affect the steepness of the falls in @xmath310 between the plateaus .",
    "however , there can be a serious danger on the visibility of the double steps : these characteristic features can be completely erased in the presence of imperfections on the interface as we discuss now .",
    "we checked the robustness of the double steps against the imperfections on the interface . in this case",
    ", we expect that an effective transmission barrier is created on the interface which can easily obscure the ideal ac profile . to understand this effect , we assumed a spin - neutral barrier potential as @xmath314 with @xmath315 describing the barrier strength and then calculated the ac .",
    "our results confirm the expectation that , the shape of the ac is extremely fragile against the surface imperfections and the double step behaviour is destroyed completely .",
    "highly clean interfaces are therefore needed to observe the ideal double step behaviour .",
    "( in units of @xmath303 ) for a semi infinite n - ncs interface including a delta - function - like interface potential @xmath314 when a ) both pair potentials are nonzero , b ) @xmath316 and @xmath317 .",
    "the @xmath315 values are given in units of an energy scale equivalent to @xmath318.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fp ]",
    "in this work , we concentrated on the rlns expected to be present in weakly anisotropic noncentrosymmetric superconductors .",
    "theories incorporating exact momentum dependence of the ops point at the existence of such nodes .",
    "they emerge in the weakly anisotropic limit , in contrast to the alns appearing under strongly anisotropic conditions . in an rln ,",
    "the pair potential vanishes in at least one reciprocal space point where the singlet and the triplet couplings become locally comparable . in weakly anisotropic systems rlns are pronounced since their more anisotropic counterparts ( the alns ) are absent .",
    "we demonstrated that , they affect the low temperature dynamics that are not explained by the alns . in particular , when they are not on the fermi surface , the rlns can imitate a bcs like behaviour in the low temperature thermodynamic measurements without giving up the unconventional pairing and the topology .",
    "this finding is crucial in that , a number of experimental results on ncss in favour of _ trivial s - wave coupling _ may need to be reconsidered and these results may happily turn out to be nontrivial . furthermore several compounds with broken trs are reported to show a similar behaviour@xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the picture presented in this work may be also relevant in the time reversal symmetry broken ncss .",
    "the topology is classified by the relative position of the rln in the pair potential with respect to the fermi wavevector .",
    "the latter can be shifted by the chemical potential and the soc .",
    "this brings an additional importance to the rlns since their topology can be manipulated externally by electrostatic gates and the spin - orbit strength .",
    "this can have promise in new research directions based on superconducting node engineering with implications in exotic device applications in topological quantum computing .",
