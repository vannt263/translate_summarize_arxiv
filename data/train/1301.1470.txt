    "apparent speeds of jet components are also measured ( e.g. piner et al .",
    "2010 ) , and jet bending on parsec scales is found .    in the optical and near - ir bands ,",
    "pks 2155 - 304 was observed with various instruments to study its host galaxy ( falomo et al .",
    "1991 , kotinailen et al .",
    "it was found that the object is hosted by a luminous elliptical galaxy ( m@xmath2 = -24.4 and m@xmath3= -26.8 ) at a redshift of 0.116 ( falomo et al .",
    "1993 , sbarufatti et al 2006 ) .",
    "the field around the object is moderately rich of galaxies .",
    "spectroscopy of some of them show that they are at the same redshift of the bl lac source indicating that its host galaxy is the dominant member of a group of galaxies .",
    "the closest companion galaxy is found 4.6 ( @xmath09.7 kpc ) from the source ( falomo et al .",
    "1991 , 1993 ) .",
    "curiously while several bl lac objects were imaged by hubble space telescope ( hst ) cameras during various campaigns ( see e.g. scarpa et al 2000 ) , pks 2155 - 304 was never observed with the hst and the best available high resolution images in the optical band remain those obtained by falomo et al .",

    ", we obtained high resolution ( @xmath00.12 arcsec ) nir images with the innovative multi conjugate adaptive optics demonstrator ( mad ) system at eso ( european southern observatory ) vlt ( very large telescope ) .",

    "the only other object of this class showing an optical jet is 3c 371 ( scarpa et al . 1999 , sambruna et al.2007 ) . to complement the new nir images we also perform a detailed analysis of archival vla images and compare with the new nir data .    in the following ,",
    "we adopt the concordance cosmology with @xmath4=0.3 , @xmath5=0.7 and h@xmath6= 70 km s @xmath7 mpc@xmath7 . in this scenario , at z=0.116 , 1 arcsec corresponds to 2.1 kpc .",
    "we performed j and ks band observations ( see * figure * 1 ) of pks 2155 - 304 on 2007 september 28 using the eso mad mounted at ut3 ( melipal ) of the vlt .",
    "mad is a prototype for multi conjugate adaptive optics ( mcao ) system which aims to demonstrate the feasibility of different mcao reconstruction techniques in the framework of the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) concept and the 2nd generation vlt instruments .",
    "mad is designed to perform wide field of view ( fov ) adaptive optics correction in j , h and ks band over 2 arcmin on the sky by using relatively bright ( m(v)@xmath8 14 - 16 ) natural guide stars ( ngs ) .",

    "pks 2155 - 304 shows a clear evidence of variability in its non thermal continuum emission , which is a common feature for bl lac objects ( urry & padovani 1995 ) and it is consistent with previous observations ( e.g. kedziora - chudczer et al .",

    "concerning the morphology , at low resolution ( l band , figure 4 top panel ) , pks 2155 - 304 is dominated by a bright core with a peak flux density of 0.38 jy / beam and a second component is present at 12 arcsec from the core in the nw direction with a flux density of @xmath00.3 jy .",
