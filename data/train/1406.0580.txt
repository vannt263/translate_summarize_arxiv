    "in this article , we investigate the stochastic homogenization problem for a second order elliptic equation of divergence form that is posed on domains separated by an ensemble of simply closed surfaces , with jump type transmission conditions across them . the surfaces that separate the spatial domain have length scale @xmath0 and they are realized as a random deformation from a periodic structure of surfaces .",
    "our goal is to study the behavior , as @xmath1 goes to zero , of the solution to this equation .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath2 be an open bounded subset in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which is divided by a random ensemble of simply closed interfaces @xmath5 into @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath7 denotes the union of the interiors enclosed by the interfaces in @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denotes the rest of the domain .",
    "the small parameter @xmath8 is the length scale of interfaces .",
    "we study the behavior of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the indicator function of an open set @xmath11 , and @xmath12 solves the following problem : @xmath13 the first line in is understood as two equations for , respectively , @xmath14 on @xmath6 and @xmath15 on @xmath7 .",
    "the variable @xmath16 denotes the realization of the random ensemble @xmath5 , which is obtained by a random deformation of a periodic ensemble followed by rescaling .",
    "notice that @xmath17 and hence @xmath18 are all random .    the problem above models , among many other natural applications , the stationary conductivity of heat through a medium that contains heat resistant membranes @xmath5 .",
    "the anisotropic diffusion coefficients @xmath19 form a @xmath20 matrix with entries @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a random diffeomorphism on @xmath3 and @xmath23 is a @xmath24-periodic uniformly elliptic matrix . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath25 is symmetric .",
    "the second and third equations in are the transmission conditions across the membranes .",
    "there , we define the conormal derivative of @xmath26 , i.e. the normal flux , at @xmath27 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the unit outer normal vector along the boundary @xmath5 of @xmath7 .",
    "the transmission conditions depict that the flux is continuous across the interface while the potential field @xmath12 itself has a jump which is proportional to the flux .",
    "this jump condition is obtained asymptotically by considering the membranes as interfacial thermal barriers whose thickness is sent to zero .",
    "we refer to carslaw and jaeger @xcite for the physical justification of these conditions , and the book of milton @xcite for a comprehensive treatment of composite materials .",
    "equations with highly oscillating coefficients and/or highly oscillating domains arise naturally in many applications in physics and engineering . due to the small scale variations , it is difficult to study such equations directly .",
    "for instance , straightforward numerical simulations of such equations become a daunting task when the scale is very small .",
    "it is hence plausible to seek for simplified equations which approximate the heterogeneous ones when the small scale tends to zero , under certain assumptions on the coefficients and the problem settings , e.g. periodicity or stationary ergodicity .",
    "this is the well known homogenization theory , which has a long history that dates back to the 70 s ; see e.g. bensoussan , lions and papanicolaou @xcite and tartar @xcite for the periodic setting , and papanicolaou and varadhan @xcite and kozlov @xcite for the random setting .",
    "we refer to the books of zhikov , kozlov and olenik @xcite for a comprehensive treatment of homogenization theory .",
    "in this paper we study homogenization of where both the elliptic coefficients and the interfaces are random and vary on a scale of @xmath1 . more precisely , our random setting is obtained by a random deformation from the corresponding periodic setting , in which the coefficients and the interfaces are periodic .",
    "our idea takes inspiration from the random settings of blanc , le bris and lions @xcite .",
    "details of the setting are in section [ sec : form ] .",
    "the resulting medium is @xmath30-stationary ergodic , which is different from the usual @xmath3-stationary ergodic .",
    "our main result , theorem [ thm : homog ] below , shows that as @xmath31 , for almost all @xmath16 , the unique solution @xmath32 of converges to the solution of the following deterministic equation @xmath33 we note the effective medium does not contain any conductivity resistant membrane , @xmath12 converges strongly in @xmath34 to @xmath35 , and the flux @xmath36 converges weakly in @xmath37 to the homogenized flux @xmath38 .",
    "the homogenized elliptic coefficients @xmath39 are deterministic constants given by the formula .",
    "the homogenization problem of in the periodic case was first studied by monsurr @xcite . later",
    ", the parabolic version was studied by donato and monsurr @xcite , and the wave equation case was studied by donato , faella and monsurr @xcite .",
    "since the interfaces divide the physical domain of the equation , homogenization of equations with interfaces is closely related to homogenization in perforated domains .",
    "the study of the latter problem goes back at least to cioranescu and saint jean paulin @xcite , and a general framework for periodic perforations was developed by cioranescu and murat @xcite .",
    "the main tool in @xcite was the construction of an operator that extends functions to interior of the perforations , which was used also in @xcite .",
    "allaire and murat @xcite studied homogenization of neumann problem on perforated domains without using this extension operator .",
    "recently , allaire and habibi @xcite studied the interface problem using the two - scale convergence method . in the random setting , homogenization in perforated domain was studied by zhikov @xcite .",
    "to our best knowledge , random homogenization of the interface problem was first studied by the author with ammari , garnier , giovangigli and seo @xcite , where randomly deformed structure with constant isotropic conductivity is considered and we constructed a random extension operator following the ideas of @xcite .",

    "one can solve the lifted problem in the probability space , owing to the weyl decomposition of @xmath67 vectors in @xmath66 , and then push this solution back to the physical space .",

    "the stationary ergodic setting in this paper is not standard : stationarity is with respect to all @xmath30 translations ( rather than @xmath3 translations ) only .",
    "the program above breaks down since it is not clear how to lift the problem to probability space .",
    "we need to solve in the physical space .",
    "we first regularize the problem by adding a small zero - order absorption term , to remedy the lack of poincar inequality",
    ". then we solve the regularized problem in the space of locally uniform sobolev spaces for each realization , by solving a truncated dirichlet problem on bounded domains that exhaust the whole space ; our method takes inspiration from the work of grard - varet and masmoudi @xcite and that of dalibard and prange @xcite where boundary layer systems of navier - stokes equations in unbounded channels were studied .",
    "usage of locally uniform sobolev spaces to study problems on unbounded domains was pioneered by kato @xcite .",
    "the regularized solutions turn out to be stationary and we establish averaged ( in the probability space ) estimates for the gradient of the regularized solution that are uniform with respect to the regularization parameter .",
    "these uniform estimates allow us to obtain , when the regularization is sent to zero , a converging subsequence along which the gradient and the jumps on the interfaces converge to a stationary fields .",
    "we find the desired solution to from those limits .",
    "once this is completed , the homogenization theory is proved essentially by the standard oscillating test function method .",

    "the proof of our main theorem is detailed in section [ sec : proof ] using the standard oscillating test function method of murat and tartar @xcite while the key to the proof , i.e. the study of the auxiliary problem , is in section [ sec : auxil ] .",

    "in this section we first describe the random settings for the elliptic coefficients in and the interfaces which divide the spatial domain .",
    "then we state the main results of the paper .",
    "the random medium of this paper , i.e. the random coefficients and the random interfaces in , is obtained as the image of a periodic medium with periodic coefficients and periodic interfaces under a random deformation followed by a rescaling .",
    "hence , we describe the periodic setting first .    * periodic setting . * due to periodicity , the medium is determined on the unit cell .",
    "this cell is denoted by @xmath91 , the unit cube in @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath42 be a simply connected open subset of @xmath56 with smooth ( say @xmath92 for @xmath93 ) boundary @xmath94 .",
    "hence this boundary is the unit interface and is denoted as @xmath95 .",
    "this interface decomposes the unit cell to @xmath42 and @xmath96 .",

    "<S> we study the homogenization of a stationary conductivity problem in a random heterogeneous medium with highly oscillating conductivity coefficients and an ensemble of simply closed conductivity resistant membranes . </S>",
    "<S> this medium is randomly deformed and then rescaled from a periodic one with periodic membranes , in a manner similar to the random medium proposed by blanc , le bris and lions @xcite . across the membranes , </S>",
    "<S> the flux is continuous but the potential field itself undergoes a jump of robin type . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that , for almost all realizations of the random deformation , as the small scale of variations of the medium goes to zero , the random conductivity problem is well approximated by that on an effective medium which has deterministic and constant coefficients and contains no membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the effective coefficients are explicitly represented . </S>",
    "<S> one of our main contributions is to provide a solution to the associated auxiliary problem that is posed on the whole domain with infinitely many interfaces , in a setting that is neither periodic nor stationary ergodic in the usual sense .    35b27 , 35r60 , 74q05    stochastic homogenization , perforated domain , heterogeneous medium , unbounded domain , transmission problem </S>"
