    "complex networks @xcite pervade our everyday life .",
    "these range from biological networks @xcite such as metabolic network @xcite representing interactions among metabolites and enzymes responsible for growth and maintenance of a cell , to transportation networks @xcite such as the road , rail and airline network linking cities across the world , to social networks such as facebook @xcite linking individuals based on their friendships .",
    "a key goal of network theory is to characterize the structure of networks and investigate structure - function relationships @xcite .    in this direction ,",
    "a focus has been the geometrical characterization of model and real - world networks @xcite . in geometry ,",
    "curvature plays a central role , since it represents a measure to quantify the deviation of a geometrical object from being flat .",
    "given the essential role of curvature in differential geometry wherefrom this notion originated , the search for its analogue in various generalized settings , and in particular , in the discrete case is only natural .",
    "however , only with the advent of computer science and modern graph theory did this drive attend maturity ( see below ) .",
    "sectional curvature is the most expressive classical curvature , that has proved to be extremely fruitful leading to significant generalizations in geometry ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the sectional curvature with the notable exception of combinatorial curvature ( or angular defect ) , has turned out to be less fruitful in the context of graph theory .",
    "combinatorial curvature has led to several applications in graph theory , computational geometry , graphics and imaging .",
    "in particular , the role of combinatorial curvature in studying the properties of various types of networks has been realized and exploited , even if , in many cases , only in the simplest form of clustering coefficient @xcite .",
    "shortly , a number of other more elaborate and _ geometric _ types of sectional curvature have also been considered @xcite .",
    "in contrast to sectional curvature , ricci curvature is a more abstract and less intuitive concept .",
    "the work of grigori perelman on the geometrization conjecture @xcite has led to renewed interest in ricci curvature and its discretizations .",
    "ricci curvature has proved to be more versatile and flexible compared to sectional curvature , rendering many discretizations for graphs and alike structures @xcite .    in particular , ollivier s discretization of the ricci curvature @xcite has proven to be successful for both conceptual advances @xcite and practical applications @xcite in the domain of networks . however , ollivier - ricci curvature has some limitations .",
    "ollivier - ricci curvature necessitates the calculation of the earth mover s distance or wasserstein 1-metric , and this in practice requires solving a linear programming problem .",
    "thus , the calculation of ollivier - ricci curvature is computationally intensive and may be forbidden for very large networks .",
    "ollivier - ricci curvature has formal basis in optimal transport theory , and thus , ollivier s curvature is well suited to investigate information transfer in communication networks .",
    "however , ollivier - ricci curvature may be less suited to investigate interaction networks such as protein - protein interactions .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce another discretization of the classical ricci curvature proposed by r. forman @xcite to the domain of complex networks .",
    "remarkably , forman s curvature for complex networks is enticingly simple to compute in large - scale networks .",
    "forman s curvature is general and flexible which renders it suitable for most situations .",
    "notably , unlike clustering coefficient , forman s curvature is defined for any edge in the network , and does not presume the existence of triads or triangles in the graph . moreover",
    ", the definition of forman s curvature elegantly incorporates the weights of edges and nodes in the network . hence , forman s curvature is suitable to study both unweighted and weighted networks .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section [ formancurvature ]",
    ", we introduce the forman curvature for networks . in section [ dataset ]",
    ", we describe the model and real networks used to investigate the forman curvature for networks , while section [ results ] contains our main results .",
    "we conclude , in section [ conclusion ] , with suggestions for future extensions and possible applications .",
    "connecting the nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 and contribution from edges parallel to the edge @xmath2 under consideration .",
    "an edge is considered to be _",
    "parallel _ to a given edge @xmath2 , if it has in common with @xmath2 either a _ child _",
    "( i.e. , a lower dimensional face ) , or a _ parent _",
    "( i.e. , a higher dimensional face ) , but not both simultaneously .",
    "the edges @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are parallel to @xmath2 because they share the node @xmath0 .",
    "analogously , the edges @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are parallel to @xmath2 because they share the node @xmath1 .",
    "see appendix for additional discussion . ]    in this section , we introduce forman curvature to the realm of complex networks , and present the mathematical formula to compute the forman curvature in undirected networks .",
    "forman s @xcite discretization of the classical ricci curvature holds for a broad class of geometric objects , the so called ( _ regular _ ) @xmath10 _ complexes _ @xcite .",
    "a full definition of this notion is out of the scope of this paper , and the interested reader is directed to forman s article @xcite for details . here",
    ", we only wish to emphasize that the broad class of geometric objects for which forman s discretization of the classical ricci curvature holds include polyhedra , triangular meshes , and most important for this work , ( locally finite ) graphs .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that forman s definition of the classical ricci curvature for the case of cell complexes is based on a proper interpretation of the so called _ bochner - weitzenbck formula_. again the mathematical expression of the forman - ricci curvature is extremely technical and less relevant in the present context of networks , and the interested reader may refer for example @xcite for details .",
    "we remark that , in the classical context , the forman ricci curvature gives the relationship between the riemannian _ good _ laplacian and the so - called _ rough _ laplacian , in terms of a complicated expression containing the curvatures of the manifold .",
    "simply stated , it corrects the standard laplacian which is also known as the laplace - beltrami operator , in terms of the curvatures of the underlying manifold .",
    "since laplacian plays a key role in heat equation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , one can gain some physical intuition by realizing that the heat evolution on a curved metal plate differs from that on a planar plate in a manner that is evidently dependent on the shape ( i.e. , curvature ) of the plate .",
    "we also suggest possible applications of the forman s version of the laplacian in our concluding remarks .    due to the technical nature of the forman - ricci curvature ,",
    "we choose not to present here the expression for forman s curvature in its general form , but would rather restrict ourselves to highlighting the following important point .",
    "ricci curvature operates directionally along vectors .",
    "a direct consequence of this fact is that , in our discrete setting , forman s curvature is associated with the discrete analogue of a vector , namely , edges .",
    "forman curvature for an edge ( which is in dimension 1 ) is given by the following formula :    @xmath11 \\right)\\,\\ ] ]    where    * @xmath2 denotes the edge under consideration between two nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 . *",
    "@xmath12 denotes the weight of the edge @xmath2 under consideration .",
    "* @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the weights associated with the nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "* @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the set of edges incident on nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , after _ excluding _ the edge @xmath2 under consideration which connects the two nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see figure [ edge_parallel ] ) .",
    "note that _ by definition _ this notion of curvature is intrinsically associated with edges , and thus , forman curvature is inherently suited to networks .",
    "also , this notion of curvature does not necessitate any artifice such as extending a measure for the curvature of nodes to the edges .    on the other hand",
    ", while forman curvature is essentially defined on edges ( as it represents a discretization of ricci curvature ) , it can be elegantly extended to nodes as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the set of edges incident on the node @xmath19 and deg(@xmath19 ) denotes the degree of node @xmath19 .",
    "this definition of the forman curvature of nodes in network is handy because several standard measures ( such as degree and clustering coefficient ) to characterize the structure of networks are defined for the nodes .",
    "thus , the definition of the forman curvature of nodes enables a comparative analysis with other node based network measures .",
    "a full explanation of the formula above , in particular of the role of parallel edges , is beyond the scope of the present paper , and we refer the interested reader to forman s original article @xcite",
    ". however , we provide an intuitive interpretation of forman curvature in the appendix .",
    "we have analyzed the forman curvature in diverse networks which include both model and real - world networks . in this study , we have considered the following generative models for networks :    * * erds - rnyi ( er ) model * @xcite is widely used to generate random graphs .",
    "er model gives an ensemble @xmath20 of graphs where @xmath21 is the number of nodes and @xmath22 is the probability that each possible edge exists between any pair of nodes in the network . * * watts - strogatz ( ws ) model * @xcite generates graphs with small - world properties of high clustering coefficient and small average path length .",
    "this model initially starts with a regular ring lattice , a graph with @xmath21 nodes where each node is connected to its @xmath23 nearest neighbors .",
    "next an endpoint of each edge in the regular ring lattice is rewired with probability @xmath24 to a new node ( which is selected from all possible nodes in the network with a uniform probability ) . *",
    "* barabsi - albert ( ba ) model * @xcite generates scale - free networks with power - law degree distribution . this growing network model initially starts with a graph of @xmath25 nodes .",
    "next new nodes are added to the initial graph one at a time , and each new node is connected to @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath25 existing nodes with a probability that is proportional to the degree of existing nodes . formally , in this preferential attachment model , the probability @xmath28 that the new node is connected to existing node @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the degree of existing node @xmath29 and the sum in the denominator is taken over the degree of all existing nodes @xmath32 .",
    "thus , high - degree nodes acquire more edges over time compared to low - degree nodes in this model . *",
    "* power - law cluster ( plc ) model * @xcite is an extension of the ba model that generates scale - free networks with power - law degree distribution and approximate average clustering .",
    "compared to the ba model , the plc model contains an extra step where the addition of a random edge between a new node and an exiting node @xmath29 is followed by the possibility of adding an edge between the new node and a neighbor of the existing node @xmath29 .",
    "this extra step in the plc model renders the formation of triads more likely , and thus , can generate networks with high average clustering coefficient .",
    "in addition to the model networks , we have analyzed the following undirected real - world networks :    * * us power grid network * @xcite captures the high - voltage power grid in the western states of usa . in this network of 4941 nodes and 6594 edges ,",

    "our results suggest that nodes with highly negative forman curvature seem more important than nodes with high clustering coefficient to maintain the large - scale connectivity of model and real networks .",

    "we also find a significant negative correlation between forman curvature and different centrality measures including betweenness , eigenvector and closeness centrality in random , small - world and scale - free networks . in real networks ,",
    "we find a weak to high negative correlation between forman curvature and centrality measures .",
    "clustering coefficient has been used as a reference measure to quantify curvature in complex networks @xcite .",
    "we find no correlation between forman curvature and clustering coefficient in random and small - world networks , while a weak negative correlation was found in scale - free networks .",
    "similarly , there is an extremely weak or no correlation between forman curvature and clustering coefficient in analyzed real networks .",
    "our results underline that forman curvature has stronger association with degree and centrality measures compared to clustering coefficient .    by investigating the effect of removing nodes based on their forman curvature on the large - scale connectivity of networks ,",
    "we show that both model and real networks are vulnerable to targeted removal of nodes with highly negative forman curvature .",
    "moreover , in both model and real networks , node removal based on increasing order of forman curvature leads to faster disintegration compared to node removal based on decreasing order of clustering coefficient .",
    "our results underscore the importance of nodes with highly negative forman curvature compared to those with high clustering coefficient for the maintenance of the large - scale connectivity in networks .",
    "forman s curvature for networks introduced here like the more established ollivier s curvature @xcite for networks is a discretization of the the classical ricci curvature .",
    "previously , ni _ et al _",
    "@xcite have studied the ollivier s curvature in both model and real networks .",
    "interestingly , we find that our results for forman s curvature in networks are qualitatively similar to those obtained by ni _ et al _",
    "@xcite for the ollivier s curvature in networks . like",
    "ni _ et al _",
    "@xcite for ollivier s curvature , in both model and real networks , we find that most nodes and edges have a negative forman curvature , and are vulnerable to targeted deletion of nodes with negative forman curvature .",
    "however , the analysis of ni _ et al _",
    "@xcite for ollivier s curvature was limited to communication networks among real networks .",
    "in contrast , we have performed an extensive analysis of the forman curvature that spans across biological , social and communication networks .",
    "fundamentally , still the qualitative agreement seen between our results for forman s curvature and ni _ et al _ for ollivier s curvature , reinforces the strength of both types of curvature for complex networks , and shows that the two curvatures , both in theoretical and practical sense , represent good discretizations of ricci curvature .",
    "strikingly , the formula to compute forman s curvature in networks is extremely simple and can easily scale to very large networks .",
    "in contrast , the calculation of ollivier s curvature in networks is computationally intensive as it requires solving a difficult linear programming problem associated with the optimal mass transport .",
    "thus , the computation of ollivier s curvature may be computationally infeasible in extremely large networks . also , a detailed comparative analysis of forman s curvature and ollivier s curvature in diverse networks is a natural follow - up of this work , but such follow - up analysis will require substantial more effort compared to this work .",
    "several other natural extensions of the present work can be foreseen in the near future . in the present work",
    ", we have ported the concept of forman curvature from differential geometry to the sphere of undirected networks .",
    "however , several important real - world networks including the world wide web ( www ) @xcite , metabolic network @xcite , gene regulatory network @xcite and neural network @xcite are inherently directed in nature .",
    "an extension of the forman curvature to directed edges is necessary for proper investigation of directed networks .",
    "notice that the mathematical formula of the forman curvature ( equation [ formanricciedge ] ) contains terms with square root of node weights and edge weights in the denominator , and thus , the formula of the forman curvature can only be utilized to compute curvature in networks with positive weights of nodes and edges .",
    "we remark that the formula of the forman curvature for edges in networks was derived from a more general formula by forman which is applicable to a broad class of geometric objects , and thus , the weights in the present formula correspond to the riemannian notions of length , area , volume , etc . , considered by forman which must be positive . however , nodes and edges in real - world networks such as gene regulatory network @xcite and neural network @xcite can have negative weights .",
    "for example , negative edge weights in gene regulatory network represent repressive interactions between transcription factors and regulated genes .",
    "thus , an extension of the forman curvature to account for negative weights of edges and nodes will enable proper investigation of signed networks .    we conclude with a suggestion for another possible extension that stems from a theoretical , albeit straightforward , reflection of the mathematical formula of the forman curvature . as mentioned in section [ formancurvature ] , the definition of the forman curvature",
    "is coupled with two fitting laplacians . in future",
    ", it will be interesting to utilize these laplacians associated with the forman curvature for standard applications of spectral analysis and denoising in large - scale networks .",

    "es would like to thank jie gao , david gu , and especially , eli appleboim , for interesting discussions .",
    "as mentioned in section [ formancurvature ] , forman s discretization of ricci curvature is derived from the so called bochner - weitzenbck formula , and , as such , its geometric content is , perhaps , less than transparent .",
    "however , we can still gain some insight into this curvature measure by following forman s own approach @xcite .",
    "forman s curvature was devised as a discrete version of the classical ricci curvature by keeping in mind surfaces and higher dimensional ( smooth ) manifolds .",
    "still one can gain intuition on forman s curvature by considering the simpler yet relevant case of two - dimensional surfaces .    a first important insight to gain arises from the fact that ricci curvature is _ intrinsic_. an _ intrinsic _ measure is independent of the _ embedding _ in the space , while an _ extrinsic _ measure is dependent upon the chosen ( or given ) embedding . in the smooth setting ,",
    "isometric embeddings are formally defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath40 be smooth riemannian manifolds and let @xmath41 be a smooth mapping .",
    "then @xmath42 is called :    * an _ immersion _ if @xmath43 has maximal rank ( i.e. , equal to @xmath26 ) at every point @xmath44 .",
    "* an _ embedding _ if it is an immersion and a homeomorphism onto its image . * an _ isometric embedding _ if it is an embedding and if it preserves the length of ( smooth ) curves .    intuitively , a property ( e.g. length , curvature , etc . ) is intrinsic if it does not depend upon the specific realization of the given geometrical object ( e.g. of a surface in euclidean space ) . in our context , it means that forman s curvature depends solely on the combinatorial data ( i.e. , adjacency matrix ) and prescribed weights of the network . but",
    "forman s curvature is not dependent , for instance , on the way the edges are drawn , say in the plane , and nor on the relative magnitudes or distribution of the weights . since in forman s original concept ,",
    "edge weights represent abstractizations of the notion of length , the connection with the classical notion of intrinsic embedding becomes quite transparent ( see also the discussion below ) .",
    "let us now see how this definition translates into a more discrete setting by considering a square grid shown in figure [ curvature](a ) . for the square grid in figure [ curvature](a ) ,",
    "the following points need to be emphasized .",
    "first , in the classical ( smooth manifold ) setting , forman - ricci curvature is measured along a vector whose discrete analogue is an edge .",
    "second , the intrinsic _ distances _ on the square grid shown in figure [ curvature](a ) need to be identified . following forman @xcite ,",
    "the only edges contributing to the intrinsic _ distances _ are the ones parallel to the edge @xmath45 under consideration in figure [ curvature](a ) .",
    "that is , those edges that either have a common _ parent _ ( higher dimensional face ) or a common _ child _ ( lower dimensional face ) with edge @xmath45 contribute to the intrinsic _ distances _ , but not those edges which have both a common parent and common child .",
    "one can convince themselves about the truth of this assertion by passing to a degenerate case , namely , by collapsing the _ incoming _ ( adjacent ) edges as shown in figure [ curvature](b ) .",
    "it can be shown that the parallel edges are precisely the ones that make a contribution to the meaningful laplacian which is intrinsically associated with the forman - ricci curvature along the edge @xmath45 ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , based on these observations , one can regard the forman - ricci curvature of an edge as a measure of the weighted flow along the given edge .    in the limiting case of graphs or networks considered here , there are no higher dimensional faces than the one - dimensional faces which correspond to the edges of the network , and this realization leads to the mathematical formula ( equation [ formanricciedge ] ) for the forman curvature of the edge .",
    "we remark that the interpretation of the forman - ricci curvature still holds for the case of networks .",
    "namely , the forman curvature is a measure of the flow across an edge in the network , as contributed by the edges adjacent to it .",
