    "similar electronic logic is used with other individual pibeta detectors discussed in the following sections .    in order to suppress the background caused by detector hits not associated with a @xmath5-stop event we use two active beam collimators ac@xmath9 and ac@xmath10 .",

    "the slope of the low - energy ridge of the deposited energy spectrum in bc is determined by a convolution of the vavilov probability distribution and the pmt photoelectron statistics .",
    "since the latter deteriorates with radiation damage , the slope of the low - energy edge of the adc spectrum can be used as a rough indicator of the effects of radiation damage on detector resolution , in the absence of a sharp monoenergetic line .",
