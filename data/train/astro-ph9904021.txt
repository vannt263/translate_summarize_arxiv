    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) arise naturally in most cosmologies .",
    "perhaps the least speculative mechanism for pbh formation comes from the collapse of overdense regions in the primordial density fluctuations that gave rise to structure in the universe @xcite .",
    "thus pbhs carry information of an epoch about which we know comparatively little , and are a very useful tool for restricting theories of the very early universe , especially within the context of an inflationary scenario . in this paradigm",
    "the density spectrum is a consequence of the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field , and can in principle be calculated given an underlying model .",
    "thus , the non - observation of the by - products or of the effects of the energy density of these pbhs constrains the underlying microscopic theory .",
    "the simplest bound that can be extracted from pbh formation is generated by insisting that @xmath2 .",
    "other bounds may be derived by studying the consequences of their evaporation .",
    "given that black holes evaporate at a rate proportional to their inverse mass squared  @xcite , the phenomenological relevance of a pbh will depend upon its initial mass .",
    "smaller mass pbhs ( @xmath3  g ) will alter the heavy elements abundances @xcite as well a distort the microwave background @xcite , whereas pbhs with larger masses will affect the diffuse gamma - ray background @xcite .    the net evaporation spectrum from a collection of pbhs will depend on the initial mass distribution , which in turn depends upon the probability distribution for the density fluctuations .",
    "prior to the emergence of the cobe data , bounds from pbhs were calculated assuming a harrison - zeldovich spectrum @xmath4 , with an unknown normalization .",
    "this lead to the famous `` page - hawking '' bound and all its subsequent improvements @xcite .",
    "however , assuming that the distribution is gaussian , we can now relate the mass variance at the time of formation with the mass variance at large scales today , if we know the ( model - dependent ) power spectrum .",
    "none the less , bounds on @xmath0 have been derived within the class of models where the power spectrum is given by a power law @xmath5 over the scales of interest @xcite . indeed , in this way it follows that for the scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich spectrum pbhs have too small a number density to be of any astrophysical significance .",
    "however , observations ( see references in @xcite ) now seem to favor a tilted blue spectrum with @xmath6 ( in cdm models ) with more power at smaller scales , and thus the bounds derived from black hole evaporation can be used to constrain the tilt of the spectrum .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the aforementioned bounds in light of recent calculations which indicate that a spectrum of primordial black hole masses are produced through near critical gravitational collapse . as was pointed out by jedamzik and niemeyer @xcite ,",
    "if pbh formation is a result of a critical phenomena , then the initial mass function will be quite different then what was expected from the classic calculation of carr @xcite . in particular , the pbh mass formed at a given epoch is no longer necessarily proportional to the horizon mass .",
    "the resulting difference in the initial mass function leads to new bounds , which is the main thrust of this paper .",
    "in particular , we revisit the density bounds and the bounds derived from the diffuse gamma - ray observations .",
    "we will first derive bounds on @xmath0 in the class of models where the power spectrum is a power law over the scales of interest .",
    "we then relax this assumption and instead place bounds on the mass variance at the formation epoch .",
    "these bounds can then be applied to a chosen model by extrapolating the variance today to the formation epoch according to the appropriate power spectrum .    before continuing to the body of this work",
    ", we would like to point out that primordial black holes have also played a large role in attempting to explain various data .",
    "pbhs can serve as significant cosmological flux sources for all particle species via hawking radiation@xcite .",
    "thus it is very tempting to postulate that present - day observed particle fluxes of unknown origin are a consequence of pbh evaporation .",
    "however , to predict these fluxes , or model them realistically , we need to know the mass distribution of black holes , since their emission spectra are determined by their temperature ( or inverse mass ) .",
    "if we assume that the black holes of interest were formed from initial density inhomogeneities generated in an inflationary scenario ( which is usually assumed ) , then the black holes are either tremendously over - abundant or completely negligible . to get a phenomenologically interesting quantity of pbhs thus requires an extreme fine - tuning , as will be demonstrated below .",
    "succinctly , this fine - tuning arises because the pbh number density is an extremely rapidly varying function of the spectral index @xmath0 .",
    "thus , without even analyzing the details of the spectral profile , explaining unknown fluxes via pbh evaporation is far from compelling .",
    "carr @xcite first calculated the pbh spectrum resulting from a scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich spectrum up to an overall normalization . subsequently page and hawking calculated a bound on the normalization by calculating the expected diffuse gamma - ray spectrum from these pbhs @xcite .",
    "however , using the cobe measurements of the temperature anisotropies translated into density fluctuations ( within a cdm ) , the overall normalization can be determined . for a scale - invariant spectrum , no significant number density of pbhs",
    "is generated .",
    "however , for a tilted blue power spectrum with more power on smaller scales , a larger number density of pbhs is expected .",
    "given an initially overdense region with density contrast @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 at time @xmath9 ( using the usual comoving coordinates ) , analytic arguments predict @xcite a black hole will form if @xmath10 the lower bound on the density contrast comes from insisting that the size of the region at the time of collapse be greater than the jeans length , while the upper bounds come from the consistency of the initial data with the assumption of a connected topology .    the first calculations of the pbh mass distribution assumed the relation @xmath11 where @xmath12 determines the equation of state @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the horizon mass when the scale of interest crossed the horizon .",
    "recently , numerical evidence suggests that near the threshold of black hole formation , gravitational collapse behaves as a critical phenomena with scaling and self - similarity @xcite .",
    "a scaling relation of the following form was found @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a universal scaling exponent which is independent of the initial shape of the density fluctuation .",
    "it was later shown @xcite that such scaling should be relevant for pbh formation . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors found relation ( [ scaling ] ) to hold for pbh formation when the initial conditions are adjusted to be nearly critical .",
    "they found the exponent to be @xmath17 .",
    "they also found that for several different initial density shapes , @xmath18 , which is significantly larger than the analytic prediction of @xmath19 found by requiring that the initial overdensity be larger than the jeans mass .",
    "given eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , calculating the initial pbh mass distribution becomes analytically cumbersome , since in principle one needs to sum over all epochs of pbh formation .",
    "however , we would expect that the initial mass function would be dominated by the earliest epoch of formation if we assume a gaussian distribution with a blue power spectrum , since for larger scales the formation probability should be suppressed .",
    "this expectation was tested in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors used the excursion set formalism @xcite to calculate the initial mass function allowing for pbh formation at all epochs .",
    "the authors found that it was approximately true the that earliest epoch dominates , for the conditions of interest to us .",
    "this simplification allows us to derive quite easily the initial mass distribution @xcite .",
    "we assume gaussian fluctuations ( the effects of non - gaussianity will be briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ robust - sec ] ) and define the usual smoothed density contrast @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is background energy density .",
    "@xmath23 is the window function with support in a region of size @xmath8 .",
    "the probability that a region of size @xmath8 has density contrast between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass variance for a region of size @xmath8 , @xmath28 .    then using eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , the physical number density of pbhs within the horizon per logarithmic mass interval , at the formation epoch , can be written as @xmath29\\,\\frac{d\\delta}{d\\log m_{bh } } =      \\frac{v_h^{-1}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}\\,\\sigma\\,\\rho }      \\left ( \\frac{m_{bh}}{k m_h } \\right)^{1/\\rho}\\ ,     \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2 } \\left [ \\delta_c                + \\left(\\frac{m_{bh}}{k m_h } \\right)^{1/\\rho } \\right]^2      \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the horizon volume the the epoch of pbh formation .",
    "we assume prompt reheating , and therefore take the formation epoch to be the time of reheating , which corresponds to the minimum horizon mass  @xcite .    assuming that the power law spectrum holds down to the scales of the reheat temperature , then @xmath31 .",
    "we can then relate the mass variance today @xmath32 to the mass variance at the epoch of pbh formation @xmath33 , using @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 is the mass inside the horizon today , @xmath37 is the reheat temperature , and @xmath38 is the temperature at radiation - matter equality .",
    "this relation is essential to connect present - day density fluctuations to those of much earlier times .",
    "two important assumptions",
    "underly this useful relation : first , @xmath0 is taken to be constant over all the scales of interest .",
    "second , the universe was assumed to be radiation dominated until the temperature dropped below @xmath39  ev ( matter - radiation equality ) , and then matter dominated thereafter .    from the cobe anisotropy data",
    ", the mass variance can be calculated @xcite @xmath40 using this result we can then calculate the physical number density per unit mass interval at @xmath41 @xmath42 , \\label{phys - num - density - eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the planck mass .",
    "the physical number density at time @xmath45 is simply eq .",
    "( [ phys - num - density - eq ] ) rescaled by a ratio of scale factors , that can be written as @xmath46 finally , we should note that relation ( [ scaling ] ) is only valid for @xmath47 .",

    "in particular , our results should be trustworthy provided @xmath48 , which implies @xmath0 should not exceed the maximum @xmath49 we will see that @xmath0 does not exceed this maximum value for all of the bounds we consider .",
    "let us now calculate the total energy density in pbhs .",
    "we assume the `` standard cosmology '' where the universe began in an inflationary phase , reheated , was radiation dominated from the reheating period until matter - radiation equality , and then has been matter dominated .",

    "there are two components to the pbh density bounds that we can calculate .",
    "the first is the total energy density of the pbhs that have not decayed by a given time @xmath45 .",
    "the second is the total energy density of the products of pbh evaporation .",
    "the sum of these components must be less than the critical density @xmath57 , at any time .",
    "the evaporated products of pbhs , in particular photons , could break up elements during nucleosynthesis , disrupting the well - measured elemental abundances .",
    "this and other processes during nucleosynthesis provide additional bounds on the density of pbhs  @xcite that we do not discuss here .",
    "the simplest bound comes from the density of pbhs that have not decayed by time @xmath45 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the temperature of the universe at time @xmath45 , and @xmath60 is the initial pbh mass that has just completely evaporated by time @xmath45 , @xmath61 @xmath62 is a dimensionless weighted integral over the pbh mass spectrum between @xmath63 to @xmath64 , normalized to the total density @xmath65 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is given by eq .",

    "the case of strongly interacting particles is complicated by the hadronization process .",
    "there is a large contribution coming from pion decay , however , given the extreme sensitivity of the flux to the value @xmath0 , the effect on the bound is negligible .",

    ". the energy at which the flux turns over is determined by the competition between the two terms @xmath119 and @xmath120 in the exponential , which is set by the reheat temperature .",
    "as we lower the reheat temperature the position of the kink moves to lower energies . if the reheat temperature is higher than @xmath121 , however , the peak will stay around 100 mev , since at these temperatures the second term in the exponential will always dominate .",
    "indeed , we expect the position of the fall off to be near @xmath122 figure  [ examples - fig ] shows the flux for fixed @xmath0 for a few different reheat temperatures . the position of the kink is well tracked by eq .",
    "( [ kink ] ) .",
    "note however that the flux does not fall off exponentially at energies below the kink .",
    "this is because as we go to lower energies we pick up more of a contribution from higher redshifts .",
    "it is interesting to contrast this behavior with the flux calculated assuming that the mass of a pbh formed at a given epoch is proportional to the horizon mass at the time of collapse . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors calculated an initial mass function following the press - schecter formalism , summing over all epochs and assuming the relation @xmath123 at each epoch .",
    "they found @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the energy density and horizon mass at @xmath37 and @xmath127 this result reduces to the initial mass function first computed by page @xcite for the harrison - zeldovich spectrum with @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",

    "let us compare the above prediction with the recent comptel and egret data .",
    "the egret collaboration found that the flux in the energy range @xmath130 is well fit by the single power law @xcite @xmath131 while the comptel data @xcite in the range @xmath132@xmath133 can be fit @xcite to the power law @xmath134 below @xmath135 there is large increase in the measured flux .",
    "thus , the best bounds are found by comparing the measured flux to predicted flux at @xmath136 or at @xmath135 , whichever is larger . because of the rapid rise of the predicted spectrum relative to the measured spectrum , a change in the kink position can change the bound on @xmath0 on the order of @xmath137 , which we consider within the accuracy of our calculation .",
    "the bounds on @xmath0 from the diffuse gamma - rays are specified by the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ bound - fig ] .",
    "the bound terminates when all but the exponential tail of the pbhs decay prior to a redshift of @xmath138 , since the optical depth at such early times exceeds unity , as discussed above .",

    "therefore , these bounds should be applied to specific models , with the roughness of the bound determined by the deviations away from gaussianity .",
    "we have calculated the density of primordial black holes using the the near critical collapse mass function that results in a spectrum of pbh masses for a given horizon mass .",
    "the normalization of the pbh mass spectrum was determined using the cobe anisotropy data that allowed us to set bounds on the spectral index @xmath0 as a function on the reheat temperature .",
    "we find that restricting the density of pbhs to be less than the critical density corresponds to the restriction that the spectral index @xmath0 be less than about @xmath176 to @xmath177 , throughout the range of reheating temperatures resulting after inflation , @xmath178 to @xmath179 gev respectively .",

    "hence , we found a slightly stronger bound on the spectral index by restricting the cosmological pbh evaporation into photons to be less than the present - day observed diffuse gamma - ray flux . due to the extreme sensitivity of the pbh mass density to the spectral index ,",
    "effects such as the indirect photon flux from pbh evaporation into quarks and gluons which fragment into pions or the formation of a qcd photosphere are completely negligible when calculating the bound on @xmath0 .",
    "we should also remark that slightly stronger bounds on @xmath0 for larger reheating temperatures @xmath182 gev are expected from pbhs that decay during the epoch of nucleosynthesis .",
    "if the universe is vacuum - energy dominated , there are corrections to our bounds on @xmath0 that can be substantial .",
    "we calculated these corrections for a range of @xmath164 and applied them to our bounds on @xmath0 for the case of @xmath183 .",

    "<S> recent numerical evidence suggests that a mass spectrum of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) is produced as a consequence of near critical gravitational collapse . assuming that these holes formed from the initial density perturbations seeded by inflation , we calculate model independent upper bounds on the mass variance at the reheating temperature by requiring the mass density not exceed the critical density and the photon emission not exceed current diffuse gamma - ray measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we then translate these results into bounds on the spectral index @xmath0 by utilizing the cobe data to normalize the mass variance at large scales , assuming a constant power law , then scaling this result to the reheating temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our bounds on @xmath0 differ substantially ( @xmath1 ) from those calculated using initial mass functions derived under the assumption that the black hole mass is proportional to the horizon mass at the collapse epoch . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a change in the shape of the diffuse gamma - ray spectrum which results from the hawking radiation . finally , we study the impact of a nonzero cosmological constant and find that the bounds on @xmath0 are strengthened considerably if the universe is indeed vacuum - energy dominated today . </S>"
