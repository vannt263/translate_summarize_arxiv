    "<S> the kakimizu complex aims to capture structural information of the set of all seifert surfaces of a given knot . </S>",
    "<S> it is one of several complexes defined by considering isotopy classes of certain submanifolds and disjointness properties of representatives of such isotopy classes .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the first to study this complex was o. kakimizu ( see for instance @xcite ) , though the discovery of some facts concerning this complex date further back . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the results of m. scharlemann and a. thompson in @xcite establish that the kakimizu complex is connected .    </S>",
    "<S> recent years have seen progress in understanding key facts about the kakimizu complex : w. jaco and e. sedgwick showed that the kakimizu complex of the knot @xmath0 is finite if @xmath0 is atoroidal and has genus at least 2 ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , r. wilson showed that , in fact , it suffices to assume that @xmath0 is atoroidal ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> results pertaining to specific classes of knots can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , m. sakuma and </S>",
    "<S> k. shackleton establish concrete diameter bounds and provide an overview of the current understanding of the kakimizu complex . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they prove that the kakimizu complex is simply connected for knots of genus 1 . </S>",
    "<S> a more general understanding of the shape of the kakimizu complex is highly desirable . </S>",
    "<S> many questions remain unanswered . </S>",
    "<S> though we establish simple connectivity here , the conjectured contractibility has yet to be proved .    </S>",
    "<S> i wish to thank jesse johnson , makoto sakuma and ken shackleton for pointing out a mistake in an earlier argument pertaining to theorem [ kaksc ] . </S>",
    "<S> i also wish to thank misha kapovich for helpful conversations . </S>",
    "<S> this work was supported , in part , by a grant from the nsf . </S>",
    "<S> it was completed at the max planck institute for mathematics in the sciences , located in leipzig , germany . </S>",
    "<S> i wish to thank the institute for its hospitality . </S>"
