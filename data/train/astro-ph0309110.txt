    "polars or am her systems are accreting binary systems in which material transfers from a dwarf secondary star onto a magnetic ( @xmath010200 mg ) white dwarf through roche lobe overflow . at some height above the photosphere of the white dwarf a shock forms .",
    "hard x - rays are generated in this post - shock flow .",
    "some of these x - rays are intercepted by the photosphere of the white dwarf and are re - emitted at lower energies .",
    "soft x - rays can also be produced by dense ` blobs ' of material which impact directly into the white dwarf .",
    "further , cyclotron emission in the optical band is produced by electrons spiralling around the magnetic field lines ( see warner 1995 for a review ) .",
    "to better characterise the x - ray emission from polars we have undertaken a survey of 37 systems using _ xmm - newton_. an overview of the survey and initial results are given in ramsay & cropper ( 2003b ) .",
    "we have presented phase - resolved observations of dp leo , ww hor ( ramsay et al 2001 ) , by cam ( ramsay & cropper 2002a ) , ce gru ( ramsay & cropper 2002b ) , ev uma , rx j10021925 and rx j10072016 ( ramsay & cropper 2003a ) . here , we present phase - resolved observations on three further polars , v347 pav ( re j1844741 ) , gg leo ( rx j1015.6 + 0904 ) and eu uma ( re j1149 + 28 ) , all of which were discovered using _",
    "rosat _ and have short periods ( 90 , 80 and 90 mins respectively ) .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ was launched in dec 1999 by the european space agency .",
    "it has the largest effective area of any x - ray satellite and also has a 30 cm optical / uv telescope ( the optical monitor , om : mason et al 2001 ) allowing simultaneous x - ray and optical / uv coverage .",
    "the epic instruments contain imaging detectors spanning the energy range 0.110kev with moderate spectra resolution .",
    "the om data were taken in two uv filters ( uvw1 : 24003400  , uvw2 : 18002400  ) and one optical band ( @xmath1 band ) .",
    "the observation log is shown in table [ log ] .",
    "the data obtained using the rgs instruments were of low signal - to - noise and are therefore not discussed further .",
    "the data were processed using the _ xmm - newton _ _ science analysis software _ v5.3.3 . for details of the analysis procedure",
    "see ramsay & cropper ( 2003a ) .",
    "we show in table [ log ] the mean @xmath1 mag determined using the om for each source at the time of our observation .",
    "v347 pav was discovered using the _ rosat _ extreme uv wfc survey ( pounds et al 1993 ) and identified with a @xmath1=16 mag cataclysmic variable ( cv ) by odonoghue et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "bailey et al ( 1995 ) confirmed v347 pav as a polar when large amplitude circular polarisation variations were detected with a period of 90 min .",
    "based on a typical polar x - ray spectrum in the high accretion state , v347 pav was brighter during the _ xmm - newton _ observations compared to march 1993 but not as bright as in july 1994 ( ramsay et al 1996 ) .",
    "it was therefore in a high accretion state .",
    "gg leo was also discovered as part of the _ rosat _ all sky survey , on this occasion using the x - ray telescope .",
    "followup observations by burwitz et al ( 1998 ) identified the optical counterpart as a @xmath2 mag polar with an orbital period close to 90 min .",
    "burwitz et al ( 1998 ) reported x - ray data taken from 3 epochs : it was bright on each occasion and showed a narrow dip which was taken to be the accretion stream obscuring the accretion region . comparing the count rates we find that gg leo was at a similar x - ray brightness during these _ xmm - newton _ observations as in may 1994 , so that it was also in a high accretion state .",
    "eu uma was discovered using the _ rosat _ extreme uv wfc survey and identified with a @xmath1=17 mag cv by mittaz et al ( 1992 ) .",
    "observations using _ euve _ by howell et al ( 1995 ) found that the orbital period was likely to be 90 mins .",
    "x - ray observations using _ rosat _ data ( ramsay et al 1994 , ramsay 1995 ) showed it had a peak count rate of @xmath35 ct / s .",
    "we estimate that it was fainter by a factor of 3 in these _ xmm - newton _ observations , although it is still likely to have been in a relatively high accretion state .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      we use the best fit models in table 2 to predict the flux in the om uv filters .",
    "the flux from the post - shock accretion flow falls well below the observed uv flux in all three systems .",
    "this indicates that the emission from the unheated photosphere of the white dwarf must dominate in the uv .",
    "we can estimate the temperature for our objects based on their uv filter flux ratios .",
    "here we use the mean flux taken from those orbital phases where there were data from both filters .",
    "we use model white dwarf hydrogen atmosphere models of covering a range of temperature which were kindly supplied by detlev koester .",
    "we take the neutral absorption reported from our fits to the x - ray data ( table [ fits ] ) and convert this to optical extinction using the relationship of predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) . assuming the absorption derived from the x - ray fits are appropriate we find that the temperature of the white dwarf us is @xmath410200k for v347 pav and 920010400k and 9200 - 11500k for gg leo and eu uma respectively .",
    "this is similar to the temperatures determined for the unheated white dwarf by gnsicke ( 1998 ) .",
    "( the temperatures determined using a simple blackbody approximation are similar being @xmath33000 k hotter than that derived using white dwarf atmosphere models ) .",
    "using the white dwarf atmosphere models of koester we can set the normalisation so that it gives the measured flux in the uv filters ( this is in addition to the model used to fit the x - ray spectra ) .",
    "if we assume a white dwarf of certain radius ( based on the derived masses in  [ mass ] ) we can obtain a distance estimate .",
    "naturally since the luminosity of the white dwarf is proportional to @xmath5 and the calibration of the uv filters is reliable to @xmath35 percent , we should approach these distances with due caution . with this in mind , we estimate distances of @xmath340 - 50pc , 50 - 70pc and 60 - 80pc for v347 pav , gg leo and eu uma respectively .",
    "we thank detlev koester for kindly supplying his white dwarf model atmosphere spectra .",
    "this paper is based on observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
