    "+    a distinction is often made between brown dwarfs below , and stars above , the hydrogen - burning limit at @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the mass of jupiter ) .",
    "similarly , a distinction is often made between planetary - mass objects below , and brown dwarfs above , the deuterium - burning limit at @xmath7 . however , in the context of star formation , these distinctions are  at best  unhelpful .",
    "we will therefore refer collectively to all objects forming by gravitational instability , on a dynamical timescale , as _",
    "stars_. within this definition , we will label as hydrogen - burning stars ( hbs ) those stars with masses above the h - burning limit , as brown dwarf stars ( bds ) those stars with masses between the h - burning limit and the d - burning limit , and as planetary - mass stars ( pms ) those stars with masses below the d - burning limit .",
    "this nomenclature is summarised in table [ tab : nomen ] . since there are only 3 pms formed in our simulations , we will , for statistical purposes , sometimes lump the pms in with the bds .",
    "we note that for very low mass stars the dynamical timescale is essentially the freefall timescale at rather high density .",
    "therefore it is very short , specifically @xmath8 where we have estimated the freefall time at the centre of a marginally unstable isothermal sphere , and @xmath9 is the isothermal sound speed for molecular gas at @xmath10 .",
    "therefore the formation of pms , bds and low - mass hbs ( say below @xmath11 ) is extremely rapid ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "in contrast to our definition of stars , we will refer to all objects which form by core accretion , on a much longer timescale ( @xmath13 ) , as planets .    with these definitions",
    ", we can discuss a single coherent stellar initial mass function ( imf ) which extends below the h- and d - burning limits .",
    "this stellar imf is bounded by a minimum stellar mass , which is determined by the requirement that a star - forming condensation is able to radiate away , on a dynamical timescale , the @xmath14 work done by compression .",
    "this requirement is usually called the opacity limit , but see masunaga & inutsuka ( 1999 ) . for contemporary star formation , in the solar vicinity",
    ", the minimum stellar mass is estimated to lie in the range from @xmath15 ( rees 1976 ; low & lynden - bell 1976 ; boyd & whitworth 2005 ; whitworth & stamatellos 2006 ) .    given this low minimum stellar mass , it is very likely that the stellar imf overlaps the planetary mass function in the interval between 1 and @xmath16 .",
    "however , with the definitions above , the two mass functions are distinct in their origin .    during the last decade",
    "there has been much speculation about the origin of bds ( see review by whitworth et al .",
    "currently there are three main theories proposed : ( i ) magneto - turbulent or gravo - turbulent fragmentation , ( ii ) premature ejection of protostellar embryos from their natal cores , and ( iii ) disc fragmentation .",
    "padoan & nordlund ( 2004 ) suggest that magneto - turbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds produces prestellar cores of brown - dwarf mass with densities high enough for them to be gravitationally unstable and collapse .",
    "their model follows the standard paradigm of low - mass star formation , i.e. a prestellar core collapses to form a single star .",
    "the model does not attempt to explain the formation of bds in clusters and binaries . additionally , the highly co - ordinated supersonic velocities needed for these dense low - mass prestellar cores to form have yet to be observed",
    ".    gravo - turbulent fragmentation of collapsing prestellar cores may also produce bds .",
    "simulations ( e.g. bate et al . 2003 ; goodwin et al .",
    "2004a , b , 2006 ) of collapsing turbulent cores produce both hbs and bds , with numbers in good agreement with observation .",
    "however , these simulations have been performed with a barotropic equation of state , and therefore the effects of radiative transfer ( e.g. boss et al .",
    "2000 ; whitehouse & bate 2006 ; stamatellos et al .",
    "2007a ) are not properly captured .",
    "the ejection scenario is closely associated with the gravo - turbulent fragmentation mechanism . in numerical simulations of collapsing turbulent cores ,",
    "bds frequently form when protostellar embryos ( i.e. very low - mass protostars which have just formed ) are ejected from their natal cores due to dynamical interactions with other protostars . as a consequence of ejection they stop accreting , and",
    "so they never acquire sufficient mass to sustain hydrogen burning ( reipurth & clarke 2001 ) .",
    "bds can also form by disc fragmentation ( e.g. whitworth & stamatellos 2006 ; stamatellos et al .",
    "there are two conditions which must be met for a disc to fragment .",
    "first , the disc must be massive enough so that locally gravity can overcome thermal and centrifugal support ( toomre 1964 ) , i.e. @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the toomre parameter , @xmath19 is the sound speed , @xmath20 is the epicyclic frequency , and @xmath21 is the surface density .",
    "second , the disc must cool efficiently so that proto - condensations forming in the disc do not simply undergo an adiabatic bounce and dissolve . both theory and simulations ( gammie 2001 ; johnson & gammie 2003 ; rice et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ; mayer et al . 2004 ; mejia et al . 2005 ; stamatellos et al .",
    "2007b ) indicate that for disc fragmentation to occur , the cooling time must satisfy @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the local orbital period , and @xmath24 the adiabatic exponent .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that disc fragmentation produces bds , pms and also low - mass hbs ( stamatellos et al .",
    "these objects may either remain bound to the primary star , or be ejected into the field .",
    "the main concern with this model is whether massive extended discs actually form in the first place .",
    "observations of such discs are difficult , since they are short lived and heavily embedded in their parental clouds .",
    "we return to this issue below .",
    "two other mechanisms that might form bds are the photo - erosion of massive prestellar cores by nearby ionising stars ( whitworth & zinnecker 2004 ) , and fragmentation during the second collapse , i.e. when h@xmath25 dissociates ( whitworth & stamatellos 2006 ) .",
    "the former mechanism can only operate in the vicinity of a massive star , and therefore it can not be a major source of bds . the latter mechanism has been advocated on theoretical grounds , but it has not yet been shown to work by numerical simulations ( e.g. bate 1998 ; stamatellos et al .",
    "2007a ) .",
    "the above bd formation mechanisms are not exclusive of each other and can work in conjunction in star forming regions .",
    "for example , gravo - turbulent fragmentation can generate cores which collapse to form discs , the discs may then fragment to produce bds , and the bds may avoid accreting additional mass by being ejected .",
    "since all these mechanisms should produce both bds and low - mass hbs , we expect there to be a continuity in their statistical properties across the h - burning limit , and this is indeed what seems to be observed . like low - mass hbs , young bds have discs ( and all the consequences thereof , i.e. ir excesses , signatures of magnetospheric accretion , x - rays , outflows , etc . ) , they are sometimes found in binary and higher multiple systems , and they coexist with stars ( e.g. luhman et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "nonetheless , some authors ( e.g. thies & kroupa 2007 ) find observational evidence that bds form in a different way to hbs . in this regard",
    "the most critical factor is the _ brown dwarf desert _",
    "i.e. the lack of close bd companions to sun - like stars .",
    "radial velocity surveys have revealed a large number of planets orbiting close to sun - like stars , as well as a large number of low - mass hbs , but very few bds ( marcy & butler 2000 ; see burgasser et a. 2007 for review ) . as we shall show below",
    ", the brown dwarf desert finds a natural explanation in the mechanics of disc fragmentation and subsequent protostellar dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we explore the fragmentation of a disc having comparable mass to the central primary star .",
    "in section 2 we discuss the numerical methods we use , and in section 3 we describe the initial disc configuration . in section 4",
    "we present in detail one of the simulations performed , and then describe an ensemble of simulations . in section 5",
    "we discuss the statistical properties of the stars produced by disc fragmentation and compare them with the observed properties of bds and low - mass hbs .",
    "in section 6 we describe what observers might expect to see if they observe a fragmented disc after a few hundred years , and in section 7 we discuss the implications of the disc fragmentation mechanism for planet formation .",
    "finally , in section 8 we summarise our results .",
    "the evolution of the disc is initially followed using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , until @xmath26 of the disc mass has been accreted , either onto the stars condensing out of the disc , or onto the central primary star ; this typically takes 10 to 20 kyr .",
    "then the residual gas is ignored and the long term dynamical evolution of the resulting ensemble of stars is followed up to 200 kyr , using an n - body code .    for the hydrodynamics we use the sph code dragon ( e.g. goodwin et al .",
    "2004a , b ) , which invokes an octal tree ( to compute gravity and find neighbours ) , adaptive smoothing lengths , multiple particle timesteps , and a second - order runge - kutta integration scheme .",
    "the code uses time - dependent viscosity with parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( morris & monaghan 1997 ) and a balsara switch ( balsara 1995 ) , so as to reduce artificial shear viscosity ( artymowicz & lubow 1994 ; lodato & rice 2004 ; rice , lodato , & armitage 2005 ) .",
    "the smoothing lengths are adapted so that each particle has exactly @xmath29 neighbours ; this reduces numerical diffusion to a minimum ( attwood , goodwin & whitworth 2007 ) .",
    "sinks are created wherever a bound condensation forms and its density exceeds @xmath30 .",
    "sph particles are accreted onto a sink if they are within @xmath31 of the sink and bound to it .",
    "sinks are identified with stars .",
    "we note that our high value of @xmath32 makes the use of sinks relatively safe .",
    "the energy equation and associated radiative transfer are treated with the method of stamatellos et al .",
    "( 2007a ) .",
    "this method takes into account compressive heating or expansive cooling , viscous heating , radiative heating by the background , and radiative cooling .",
    "the method does not solve the radiation transfer equation ( which is unfeasible in hydrodynamic simulations with the current computing resources ) , but it is an appoximate method that performs well , in the optically - thin , intermediate and optically - thick regimes , and has been extensively tested ( stamatellos et al .",
    "in particular it reproduces the detailed 3d results of masunaga & inutsuka ( 2000 ) , boss & bodenheimer ( 1979 ) , boss & myhill ( 1992 ) , whitehouse & bate ( 2006 ) , and also the analytic test of spiegel ( 1957 ) .",
    "it also performs well in the analytic test of hubeny ( 1990 ) for disc geometries .",
    "it is easy to implement in particle- and grid - based codes , and highly efficient ( incurring only a @xmath33 overhead , in comparison with simulations performed using a barotropic equation of state ) .",
    "the gas is assumed to be a mixture of hydrogen and helium .",
    "we use an equation of state ( black & bodenheimer 1975 ; masunaga et al .",
    "1998 ; boley et al . 2007 ) that accounts for the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of molecular hydrogen , and for the different chemical states of hydrogen and helium .",
    "we assume that ortho- and para - hydrogen are in equilibrium .    for the dust and gas opacity we use the parameterization by bell & lin ( 1994 ) , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 are constants that depend on the species and the physical processes contributing to the opacity at each @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the opacity changes due to ice mantle evaporation and the sublimation of dust are taken into account , along with the opacity contributions from molecules and h@xmath40 ions .",
    "for the n - body part of the simulation , exploring the long term dynamical evolution of the stars formed by fragmentation of the outer disc ( from @xmath41 ) , we use a 4th - order hermite integration scheme ( makino & aarseth 1992 ) , with a conservative timestep criterion so that energy is conserved to better than one part in @xmath42 ( hubber & whitworth 2005 ) .",
    "only a few extended massive discs have been observed around sun - like stars ( e.g. eisner et al .",
    "2005 , 2008 ; eisner & carpenter 2006 ; rodriguez et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , we suggest that this is because the outer parts of such discs are rapidly dissipated by gravitational fragmentation  rather than because they seldom form in the first place .",
    "indeed , it seems that the formation of such discs is inevitable .",
    "for example , a @xmath43 prestellar core with ratio of rotational to gravitational energy @xmath44 will  if it collapses monolithically  forms a protostellar disc with outer radius @xmath45 . since the observations of goodman et al .",
    "( 1993 ) indicate that many prestellar cores have @xmath46 , the formation of extended discs should be rather common .",
    "alternatively , if an existing @xmath47 protostar attempts to assimilate matter with specific angular momentum @xmath48 , this matter is initially parked in an orbit at @xmath49 .",
    "the quantum of specific angular momentum used to normalise this relation is rather modest by protostellar standards , as can be seen by expressing it in terms of a lever - arm in parsecs and a velocity in kilometres per second , viz .",
    "@xmath50 .",
    "previous simulations ( stamatellos et al .",
    "2007b ) suggest that the outer parts of massive extended discs fragment on a dynamical timescale ( @xmath51 ) , so they are indeed very short - lived .",
    "we shall assume a star - disc system ( hereafter the _ ur - system _ ) , in which the central primary star ( hereafter the _ ur - star _ ) has initial mass @xmath52 . initially the disc ( hereafter the _ ur - disc _ ) has mass @xmath53 , inner radius @xmath54 , outer radius @xmath55 , surface density @xmath56 temperature @xmath57 and hence approximately uniform initial toomre parameter @xmath58 .",
    "thus the disc is at the outset marginally gravitationally unstable .",
    "( the _ ur- _ prefix is used solely because it otherwise becomes difficult later on to discuss unambiguously the smaller discs that attend newly - formed bds , the orbital parameters of bd / bd binaries , and so forth ) .",
    "we have designed a disc with @xmath59 over a wide range of radii , because we are wanting to establish which parts of the disc can , and which can not , fragment because they obey , or violate , the gammie criterion .",
    "the radiation of the ur - star is taken into account by invoking a background blackbody radiation field with temperature @xmath60 . in effect",
    ", this means that , if the material in the disc is heated by compression and/or viscous dissipation , it can only cool radiatively if it is warmer than @xmath60 given by eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : tbg ] ) .",
    "we perform twelve simulations : ten using 150,000 particles , one with 250,000 and one with 400,000 ( the last two to check convergence ) .",
    "the minimum resolvable mass ( corresponding to 100 sph particles ) is @xmath61 , and therefore the jeans condition is obeyed at all times .",
    "all of the simulations start with the same ur - system ( i.e. the same ur - disc and ur - star parameters ) .",
    "the only difference ( apart from the number of particles in the last two simulations ) is the random seed used to construct each ur - disc .",
    "thus the poisson density fluctuations are different in each simulation .",
    "this allows us to study the statistical properties of the stars produced .",
    "because the ur - discs are toomre unstable , spiral arms form and sweep up material into dense condensations . within a few thousand years , between 5 and 11 stars have condensed out of the disc . in all 12 simulations a total of 96 stars are formed .",
    "3% are pms , 67% are bds , and the rest are low - mass hbs ( with masses up to @xmath62 ) .",
    "( hereforth bd statistics will include pms , unless otherwise stated ) .",
    "stars initially condense out of the ur - disc where @xmath59 and @xmath63 , i.e. typically at distances @xmath64 au from the central star .",
    "hbs generally form closest to the ur - star , and pms form furthest from the ur - star .",
    "there are three factors producing this trend of lower - mass stars forming further out in the ur - disc : ( i ) stars condensing out at small @xmath65 condense out earlier , so they then have longer to accrete ; ( ii ) the ambient density at small @xmath65 is higher , so there is more matter to accrete ; and ( iii ) the most massive stars tend to migrate inwards , so they get to mop up the inner parts of the ur - disc where no stars have condensed out .    with between 5 and 11 stars formed in each ur - disc , initially between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , interactions between the stars are frequent . during 2-body interactions",
    ", binary systems can be formed if there is sufficient dissipation ( e.g. due to the small accretion discs which normally attend the individual stars ) . in 3-body interactions ,",
    "the lowest - mass star is often ejected into the field , and therefore stops accreting altogether .",
    "@xmath68 of the stars formed end up being ejected into the field .",
    "most of the stars below the h - burning limit , and all the stars below the d - burning limit are ejected into the field .",
    "most are ejected as single stars , but some are ejected as components of binary systems .",
    "these binary systems comprise bd / bd pairings , bd / hb pairings , and even one bd / pm pairing ; there are both wide and close systems .    ejected",
    "bds frequently retain accretion discs with masses on the order of a few jupiter masses .",
    "hence they can sustain accretion and outflows as observed ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "2003 ; muzerolle et al . 2005 ; mohanty et al . 2005 ; whelan et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the final outcome typically has a low - mass hb orbiting the ur - star at close distance ( @xmath69 ) , a low - mass hb in a wider orbit , and a couple of bds or a bd / bd binary orbiting at large distance ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "all the other stars have been ejected into the field .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdm1 ] we present column - density images of the ur - disc , every 500 yr , for one of the simulations . in this simulation",
    "7 stars form : 4 bds and 3 low - mass hbs . at the end of the simulation ( i.e. after the hydrodynamic simulation _ and _ the n - body simulation , at @xmath71 ) ,",
    "only 3 stars remain bound to the ur - star : a low - mass hb orbiting close to the ur - star ( @xmath72 ) , and a binary comprising a bd and a low - mass hb , orbiting at @xmath73 .    fig .",

    "hence the ur - disc fragments here . as time progresses the region where @xmath59 moves farther away from the ur - star as the gas in the inner regions is used up .     and",

    "the variance is the same as between two simulations performed with the same resolution , and is attributable to the different seed noise in the different simulations ( due to random positioning of the particles ) and the chaotic , non - linear nature of gravitational instability .",
    "thus , the simulations appear to be converged , in a statistical sense .    in the following sections we describe in detail the results of the simulations , focusing on the statistical properties of the stars formed , and compare them with the observed properties of bds and low - mass hbs .",
    "the ur - discs start fragmenting after @xmath78 , which corresponds to about one quarter of an outer rotation period ( @xmath79 ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tformation ] ) .",
    "stars condense out on a dynamical timescale .",
    "hence star formation occurs faster in the inner ur - disc , but even at the edge of the ur - disc it is virtually over by @xmath80 .",
    "the stars which form first , in the inner ur - disc , have more time to accrete , and more material to accrete , and hence they tend to end up as hbs , with masses up to @xmath81 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tformation ] ) .",
    "lower mass stars ( i.e. bds and pms ) tend to form at later times and at larger distances from the ur - star .          the mass distribution of the objects produced by disc fragmentation is shown in fig .",

    "there is no significant discontinuity across the h - burning limit at @xmath87 .",
    "the mass distribution drops precipitously towards lower masses , reflecting that the minimum mass for star formation is @xmath88 .",
    "the small number of stars that end up below the d - burning limit are the ones that are ejected from the ur - disc by a 3-body interaction , almost as soon as they have formed .",
    "we emphasise that the mass function presented in fig.[fig : mspectrum ] represents stars formed by fragmentation of a particular ur - system ( i.e. an ur - disc with mass @xmath89 , radius @xmath90 , etc . in orbit",
    "round an ur - star with mass @xmath91 ) .",
    "therefore it can not be compared meaningfully with the overall stellar imf .",
    "rather it will be necessary first to repeat the numerical experiment reported here for many different ur - systems ( i.e. different combinations of @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , etc . ) , and then to convolve the results with the appropriate distributions of @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , before comparing with the observed stellar imf .",
    "a monte carlo experiment addressing this aspect of the problem is in progress ( attwood et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "[ fig : rspectrum ] shows the radial distribution of the stars formed by disc fragmentation , i.e. the distance @xmath95 from the ur - star .",
    "radial distributions are shown for all stars , and then separately for hbs and bds , ( i ) at the moment of formation ( @xmath96 ; left ) , ( ii ) at the end of the sph simulation ( @xmath97 ; centre ) , and ( iii ) at the end of the n - body simulation ( @xmath98 ; right ) .",
    "stars are categorised as hbs or bds on the basis of their final masses ; here the bd category includes the pms .",
    "the most likely location at which stars form is between @xmath99 from the ur - star ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rspectrum ] ; left ) .",
    "this is the combined effect of the two criteria for disc fragmentation discussed in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "close to the central primary star ( @xmath100 ) , there is ample mass for fragmentation , so the toomre criterion is satisfied ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "however , the cooling time is high compared with the orbital period , and hence stars can not condense out fast enough and they are quickly sheared apart .",
    "this minimum radius for fragmentation agrees well both with analytical predictions ( rafikov 2005 ; whitworth & stamatellos 2006 ) , and with previous numerical simulations ( see also stamatellos et al . 2007b , stamatellos & whitworth 2008 ) .",
    "conversely , far from the ur - star ( @xmath102 ) , the cooling time is quite low , but there is only just enough mass for the disc to be toomre unstable ( @xmath103 ) , and so fragmentation is sluggish .    at locations between @xmath104 the conditions are just right for vigorous fragmentation to occur .    in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rspectrum ] ( left ) , we show separately the formation locations of hbs and bds .",
    "stars forming close to the ur - star generally accrete more gas and so their masses tend to increase above the h - burning limit .",
    "the initial radial distribution quickly changes due to dynamical interactions between the newly - formed stars . in each disc between 5 and 11 stars",

    "most of the bds have been ejected , and those that remain bound to the ur - star have wide orbits of a few hundred au .",
    "this is also seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : rmasslg ] , where the object final mass is plotted against the radius at formation ( top ) , the radius at the end of the sph simulation ( @xmath107 ; middle ) , and the radius at the end of the n - body simulation ( @xmath98 ; bottom ) . both hbs and bds form over a wide range of radii , but after the system has evolved for 200 kyr there are 13 hbs orbiting within 60 au of the ur - star , and only 1 bd . the hbs , being more massive , tend to form at smaller radii , _ and _ during dynamical 3-body interactions the more massive stars tend to become more tightly bound .",
    "this phenomenology provides a natural explanation for the brown dwarf desert , i.e. the lack of bds as close companions to sun - like stars ( @xmath108 ; marcy & butler 2000 ) in contrast with the relatively high frequency of both hbs and planets at these radii .",
    "first , stars with masses below the h - burning limit only condense out of the ur - disc at large radii ( @xmath109 )  as predicted analytically by whitworth & stamatellos ( 2006 ) .",
    "second , such stars are only likely to stay below the h - burning limit if they remain at large radius or are ejected from the ur - disc .",
    "third , the interactions which occur between stars formed in the ur - disc tend to scatter the more massive ones inwards and the less massive ones outwards . consequently the more massive stars tend to end up in the inner parts of the ur - disc where there is still gas to be accreted , and hence they tend to grow even more massive until they exceed the h - burning limit .    at the end of our simulations , only one of the 12 ur - stars has a close ( @xmath110  au ) brown - dwarf companion , whereas there are 12 low - mass hbs in the same radial interval .",
    "hence , it is @xmath111 times more likely for the close companion of a sun - like star to be an hb , rather than a bd .",

    "the stars forming further out tend to migrate outwards and/or be ejected .",
    "* as a result there is a brown dwarf desert , i.e. a lack of brown dwarfs orbiting close to the ur - star ; those brown dwarfs which are not ejected tend to end up orbiting out beyond @xmath204 . * due to dynamical interactions between stars , stellar orbits can end up quite eccentric and strongly inclined to the plane of the ur - disc .",

    "the low - mass binary frequency is @xmath205 . *",
    "these binary systems are usually close , but can be wide ; they tend to have eccentric orbits and large mass ratios ( i.e. components of comparable mass ) ; they include hb / hb pairs , hb / bd pairs , bd / bd pairs and bd / pm pairs . * these binary systems can survive ejection ; however , a bd that remains bound to the ur - star is three to five times more likely to be in a bd / bd binary system than a bd in the field . *",
    "ejection velocities are @xmath206 , but these would probably be reduced if the hydrodynamics of ejection were modelled properly ( i.e. not invoking sinks and not switching to an n - body code ) .",
    "* hot jupiters are very unlikely to form by disc fragmentation . moreover in discs which fragment like the ones modelled here , formation of hot jupiters by core accretion may also be inhibited by the stellar companions that form on close eccentric orbits .    we conclude that disc fragmentation is a robust mechanism for the formation of brown dwarf stars , as well as planetary - mass stars and low - mass h - burning stars .",
    "it explains successfully properties that are not satisfactorily explained by other formation mechanisms , for example the brown dwarf desert and the observed statistics of low mass binary systems .",

    "<S> we suggest that a high proportion of brown dwarf stars are formed by gravitational fragmentation of massive extended discs around sun - like primary stars . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that such discs should arise frequently , but should be observed infrequently , precisely because they fragment rapidly . by performing an ensemble of radiation - hydrodynamic simulations , </S>",

    "<S> the orbits of these companions are highly eccentric , and not necessarily coplanar , either with one another , or with the original disc . </S>",
    "<S> there is a bd desert extending out to at least @xmath0 ; this is because bds tend to be formed further out than low - mass hb stars , and then they tend to be scattered even further out , or even into the field .    </S>",
    "<S> bds form with discs of a few jupiter masses and radii of a few tens of au , and they are more likely to retain these discs if they remain bound to the primary star . </S>",
    "<S> binaries form by pairing of the newly - formed stars in the disc , giving a low - mass binary fraction of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these binaries include close and wide bd / bd binaries and bd / pm binaries . </S>",
    "<S> binaries can be ejected into the field and survive , even if they have quite wide separations . </S>",
    "<S> bds that remain as companions to sun - like stars are more likely to be in bd / bd binaries than are bds ejected into the field . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of close and distant companions around sun - like stars may inhibit planet formation by core accretion .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that disc fragmentation is a robust mechanism for bd formation . even if only a small fraction of sun - like stars host the required massive extended discs , this mechanism can produce all the pm stars observed , most of the bd stars , and a significant proportion of the very low - mass hb stars .    </S>",
