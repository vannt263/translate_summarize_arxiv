    "inflation has been the backbone of the high - energy cosmology over the past 30 years .",
    "in addition to addressing the horizon and flatness problems plagued in big bang cosmology @xcite , inflation generally predicts almost scale - invariant adiabatic density perturbations @xcite ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies measured by cobe @xcite and wmap @xcite .",
    "it is possible to distinguish between a host of inflationary models by comparing the theoretical prediction of the spectral index @xmath10 of curvature perturbations and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath11 with observations , but still the current observations are not sufficient to identify the best model of inflation .    in the next few years , the measurement of cmb temperature anisotropies by the planck satellite @xcite will bring more high - precision data .",
    "in addition to the possible reduction of the tensor - to - scalar ratio to the order of 0.01 , the non - linear parameter @xmath12 of primordial scalar non - gaussianities may be constrained by about one order of magnitude better than the bounds constrained by the wmap group .",
    "this can potentially provide further important information to discriminate between many inflation models .",
    "the conventional single - field inflation driven by a canonical scalar field @xmath0 with a potential @xmath13 predicts small primordial non - gaussianities with @xmath12 of the order of slow - roll parameters @xcite ( see @xcite for early works ) .",
    "however the kinetically driven inflation models ( dubbed `` k - inflation '' @xcite ) described by the lagrangian density @xmath14 , where @xmath2 is the field kinetic energy , can give rise to large non - gaussianities with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that for the lagrangian including a non - linear kinetic term of @xmath2 the propagation speed @xmath16 is different from 1 ( in the unit where the speed of light @xmath17 is @xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "since the non - linear parameter is approximately given by @xmath19 , one has @xmath15 for @xmath20 .    in the models motivated by particle physics such as superstring and supergravity theories ,",
    "there are many scalar fields that can be responsible for inflation @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "even if each field is unable to lead to cosmic acceleration , the presence of many fields allows a possibility for the realization of inflation through the so - called assisted inflation mechanism @xcite .",
    "in fact , multiple ( canonical ) scalar fields with exponential potentials @xmath21 evolve to give dynamics matching a single field with the effective slope @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath3 is smaller than the individual @xmath23 , the presence of multiple fields can lead to sufficient amount of inflation @xcite .",
    "if we take into account a barotropic perfect fluid ( density @xmath24 ) in addition to the canonical scalar field ( density @xmath25 ) with the exponential potential @xmath26 , there exists a so - called scaling solution along which the ratio @xmath27 is constant @xcite . in the presence of non - relativistic matter",
    "the scaling solution is unstable for @xmath28 , in which case another scalar - field dominated solution is a stable attractor @xcite . if @xmath29 , the latter can be used for inflation as well as dark energy .",
    "if we extend the analysis to the models described by the general lagrangian @xmath14 then the condition for the existence of scaling solutions restricts the form of the lagrangian to be @xmath1 , where @xmath3 is a constant and @xmath4 is an arbitrary function in terms of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "provided @xmath31 there exists a scalar - field dominated attractor that can be responsible for inflation @xcite .",
    "in fact this lagrangian covers a wide class of inflationary models such as the canonical scalar field with the exponential potential ( @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 ) @xcite and the dilatonic ghost condensate model ( @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 ) @xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the original ghost condensate model ) .    in the presence of multiple scalar fields",
    "it was shown that the lagrangian @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is an arbitrary function with respect to @xmath38 , gives rise to assisted inflation @xcite , as it happens for the canonical field with the exponential potential .",
    "in other words , in the regime where the solutions approach the assisted inflationary attractor , the system can be described by the effective single - field lagrangian @xmath39 with @xmath5 and the slope @xmath40 .",
    "while the scalar propagation speed is different from 1 in those models , the scalar spectral index @xmath10 and the tensor - to - scalar @xmath11 are written in terms of the function @xmath7 and its derivatives @xmath41 , @xmath42 . by specifying the functional form of @xmath7 , the observables @xmath10 and @xmath11 as well as the equilateral non - gaussianity parameter @xmath6 can be expressed by the single parameter @xmath3 in the attractor regime .",
    "this property is useful to place tight observational bounds on those models .    in this paper",
    "we confront the assisted k - inflation scenario described by the effective single - field lagrangian @xmath43 with the recent cmb observations by wmap @xcite combined with bao @xcite and the hubble constant measurement ( hst ) @xcite .",
    "we evaluate three observables @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath6 without specifying the forms of @xmath7 and apply those results to concrete models of inflation .",
    "we place observational constraints on a number of assisted inflation models such as ( a ) canonical field with the exponential potential , ( b ) tachyon @xcite , ( c ) dilatonic ghost condensate , and ( d ) dbi field @xcite .",
    "since the effect of the non - linear term in @xmath2 is important in the models ( c ) and ( d ) , the primordial non - gaussianity can reduce the parameter space constrained by the information of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we shall also study other assisted inflation models such as @xmath44 and the generalization of the dbi model .",
    "interestingly the observational bound from the equilateral non - gaussianity parameter @xmath6 combined with @xmath10 and @xmath11 can rule out some of those models .",
