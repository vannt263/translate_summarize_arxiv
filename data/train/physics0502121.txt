    "this is an extended version of the paper with the same title published in the proceedings of the conference spin2002 @xcite .",
    "a key aspect of the original paper was that the invariant spin field for snake `` resonances '' is irreducibly discontinuous at most orbital amplitudes .",
    "however , details were omitted owing to the page limit . in the meantime other papers @xcite have appeared which discuss the invariant spin field at snake `` resonances '' and it has become clear that it would be useful to extend @xcite to give more details .    we begin by presenting a slightly polished version of the original paper . then the additional material is presented as an addendum .",
    "the citations are also updated .",
    "spin motion in storage rings and circular accelerators is most elegantly systematised in terms of the invariant spin field ( isf ) and the amplitude dependent spin tune ( adst ) . here",
    "we apply them in the context of snake  resonances  .",
    "we begin by briefly recapitulating some necessary basic ideas . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "spin motion in electric and magnetic fields at the 6dimensional phase space point @xmath0 and position @xmath1 around the ring , is described by the t ",
    "bmt precession equation @xmath2  @xcite where @xmath3 is the spin expectation value ( `` the spin '' ) in the rest frame of the particle and @xmath4 contains the electric and magnetic fields in the laboratory .",
    "the isf , denoted by @xmath5 , is a 3vector _ field _ of unit length obeying the t  bmt equation along particle orbits @xmath6 and fulfilling the periodicity condition @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the circumference .",
    "thus @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the new phase space vector after one turn starting at @xmath0 and @xmath1 and @xmath11 is the corresponding spin transfer matrix .",
    "the scalar product @xmath12 is invariant along an orbit , since both vectors obey the t  bmt equation .",
    "thus with respect to the local @xmath13 the motion of @xmath3 is simply a precession around @xmath13 .",
    "the field @xmath13 can be constructed at each reference energy where it exists without reference to individual spins .",
    "the chief aspects of the isf are that : 1 ) for a turn  to  turn invariant particle distribution in phase space , a distribution of spins initially aligned along the isf remains invariant ( in equilibrium ) from turn  to  turn ,   2 ) for integrable orbital motion and away from orbital resonances the isf determines the maximum attainable time averaged polarisation @xmath14 on a phase space torus at each @xmath1 , where @xmath15 denotes the average over the orbital phases , 3 ) under appropriate conditions @xmath16 is an adiabatic invariant while system parameters such as the reference energy are slowly varied , 4 ) it provides the main axis for orthonormal coordinate systems at each point in phase space which serve to define the adst which in turn is used to define the concept of spin  orbit resonance .",
    "these coordinate systems are constructed by attaching two other unit vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 to all ( @xmath19 ) such that the sets ( @xmath20 ) are orthonormal .",
    "like @xmath13 , the _ fields _ @xmath21 and @xmath22 are 1turn periodic in @xmath1 :   @xmath23 for @xmath24 . with the basis vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 we can quantify the rate of the above mentioned spin precession around @xmath25 : it is the rate of rotation of the projection of @xmath3 onto the @xmath26 plane . except on or close to orbital resonance , the fields @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 can be chosen so that the rate of precession is constant and independent of the orbital phases @xcite .",
    "the number of precessions per turn `` measured '' in this way is called the spin tune .",
    "the spin tune , @xmath27 , depends only on the orbital amplitudes ( actions ) @xmath28 , hence the name adst .",
    "the choice of some @xmath17 and @xmath18 satisfying the condition @xmath23 for @xmath24 is not unique .",
    "an infinity of others can be chosen by suitable rotations of the @xmath29 around @xmath25 .",
    "these lead to the _ equivalence class _ of spin tunes obtained by the transformation : @xmath30 for any integers @xmath31 where the @xmath32 s are the tunes on a torus of integrable orbital motion .",
    "the adst provides a way to quantify the degree of coherence between the spin and orbital motion and thereby predict how strongly the electric and magnetic fields along particle orbits disturb spins . in particular",
    ", the spin motion can become very erratic close to the _ spin  orbit resonance _",
    "condition @xmath33 where the @xmath34 s are integers . at these resonances",
    "the isf can spread out so that @xmath35 is very small .",
    "examples of the behaviour of @xmath35 near spin ",
    "orbit resonance and the application of a generalised froissart  stora description of the breaking of the adiabatic invariance of @xmath16 while crossing resonances during variation of system parameters can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that : 1 )  the resonance condition is _ not _ expressed in terms of the spin tune @xmath36 on the closed orbit , 2 )  a `` tune '' describing spin motion but depending on orbital phases could not be meaningful in the spin ",
    "orbit resonance condition , 3 )  if the system is on spin  orbit resonance for one spin tune of the equivalence class , it is on resonance for all others . in general @xmath21 and @xmath22 do not obey the t  bmt equation along an orbit @xmath6 .",
    "but at spin  orbit resonance , they can be chosen so that a spin @xmath3 is at rest in its local ( @xmath20 ) system .",
    "then @xmath17 and @xmath18 do obey the t  bmt equation so that the isf @xmath5 is not unique .",
    "nowadays we emphasise the utility of the isf for defining equilibrium spin distributions .",
    "however , it was originally introduced for bringing the combined semiclassical hamiltonian of spin  orbit motion into action ",
    "angle form for calculating the effects of synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the initial hamiltonian is written as @xmath37 . by viewing the spin motion in the ( @xmath20 ) systems , a new hamiltonian in full action ",
    "angle form @xmath38 is obtained which is valid at first order in @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this emphasises again that , as with all action ",
    "angle formulations , the spin frequency can not depend on orbital phases . moreover , it is easy to show that at orbital resonance ,  ( i.e.   @xmath40 for suitable integers @xmath41 ) the `` diagonalisation '' of the hamiltonian ( i.e. finding the @xmath42 ) might not be possible @xcite .",
    "thus at orbital resonance the adst may not exist . on the other hand",
    ", one avoids running a machine on such resonances .",
    "the spin tune on the closed orbit @xmath43 always exists and so does @xmath44 .    for our present purposes",
    "there are two kinds of orbital resonances : resonances where at least one of the @xmath45 s is irrational and those where all are rational .",
    "we write the rational tunes as @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) where the @xmath48 and @xmath49 are integers .",
    "then for the second type , the orbit is periodic over @xmath50 turns where @xmath50 is the lowest common multiple of the @xmath49 .",
    "this opens the possibility that in this case the isf at each @xmath51 can be obtained ( up to a sign ) as the unit length real eigenvector of the @xmath50turn spin map ( c.f .",
    "the calculation of @xmath52 from the 1turn spin map on the closed orbit . ) .",
    "however , the corresponding eigentune @xmath53 extracted from the complex eigenvalues @xmath54 , depends in general on the orbital phases at the starting @xmath0 .",
    "thus in general @xmath55 is _ not _ a spin tune and should not be so named @xcite .",
    "nevertheless if @xmath50 is very large the dependence of @xmath55 on the phases can be very weak so that it can approximate well the adst of nearby irrational tunes .",
    "this is expected heuristically since the influence of the starting phase can be diluted on forming the spin map for a large number of turns . at non ",
    "zero amplitudes , both for irrational or rational @xmath45 s , the eigentune of the 1turn spin map usually has no physical significance .",
    "of course , it normally depends on the orbital phases and the corresponding eigenvectors are normally not even solutions of the t  bmt equation .    for non  resonant orbital tunes ,",
    "the spin tune can be obtained using the sodom ",
    "ii algorithm @xcite whereby spin motion is written in terms of two component spinors and su(2 ) spin transfer matrices . the _ functional equation _",
    "@xmath56 is then expressed in terms of a fourier representation , w.r.t . the orbital phases , of the spinors and of the 1turn su(2 ) matrices .",
    "the spin tune appears as the set of eigentunes of an _ eigen problem for fourier components _ and @xmath13 is reconstructed from the fourier eigenvectors .",
    "ii delivers the whole spin field on the torus @xmath28 at the chosen @xmath1 .",
    "in perfectly aligned flat rings with no solenoids , @xmath52 is vertical and @xmath57 is in the equivalence class containing @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the lorentz factor on the closed orbit and @xmath60 is the gyromagnetic anomaly of the particle . in the absence of skew quadrupoles , the primary disturbance to spin is then from the radial magnetic fields along vertical betatron trajectories",
    ". the disturbance can be very strong and the polarisation can fall if the particles are accelerated through the condition @xmath61 where mode 2 is vertical motion .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the `` single resonance model '' ( srm ) whereby a rotating wave approximation is made in which the contribution to @xmath62 from the radial fields along the orbit is dominated by the fourier harmonic at @xmath63 with strength @xmath64 .",
    "the srm can be solved exactly and the isf is given by @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the orbital phase , @xmath68 are horizontal , vertical and longitudinal unit vectors and the convention @xmath69 is used .",
    "the tilt of @xmath13 away from the vertical @xmath52 is @xmath70 so that it is @xmath71 at @xmath72 for non ",
    "zero @xmath73 . at large @xmath74 ,",
    "the equilibrium polarisation directions @xmath75 , are almost parallel to @xmath76 but during acceleration through @xmath72 , @xmath13 varies strongly and the polarisation will change if the adiabatic invariance of @xmath16 violated . the change in @xmath16 for acceleration through @xmath72",
    "is given by the froissart  stora formula .",
    "the adst which reduces to @xmath58 on the closed orbit is @xmath77 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath72 is _ not _ the spin ",
    "orbit resonance condition . on the contrary ,",
    "as @xmath78 passes through zero @xmath79 jumps by @xmath80 with our convention for @xmath13 and avoids fulfilling the true resonance condition : for particles with non  zero @xmath73 , @xmath58 is just a parameter . in this simple",
    "model @xmath79 exists and is well defined near spin  orbit resonances for all @xmath81 .",
    "this is also true in more general cases if orbital resonance is avoided .",
    "polarisation loss while accelerating through @xmath72 can be reduced by installing pairs of siberian snakes , magnet systems which rotate spins by @xmath82 independently of @xmath0 around a `` snake axis '' in the machine plane .",
    "for example , one puts two snakes at diametrically opposite points on the ring . then @xmath83 in one half ring and @xmath84 in the other . with the snake axes",
    "relatively at @xmath71 , @xmath57 is in the equivalence class containing @xmath85 for all @xmath59 . for calculations one often represents the snakes as elements of zero length ( `` pointlike snakes '' ) .",
    "then if , in addition , the effect of vertical betatron motion is described by the srm , and orbital resonances are avoided , calculations with sodom ",
    "ii , perturbation theory @xcite and the treatment in @xcite suggest that @xmath86 is in the equivalence class containing @xmath85 too , independently of @xmath59 but also of @xmath87 . thus for @xmath81 sufficiently away from @xmath85 no spin ",
    "orbit resonances @xmath88 are crossed during acceleration through @xmath72 and the polarisation can be preserved .",
    "this is confirmed by tracking calculations .",
    "however , such calculations and analytical work show that the polarisation can still be lost if the fractional part of @xmath81 , @xmath89 $ ] , is @xmath90 where here , and later , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are odd positive integers with @xmath93 and where here and later the brackets @xmath94 $ ] are used to signal the fractional part of a number .",
    "this is the so  called `` snake resonance phenomenon '' and it also has practical consequences @xcite , especially for small @xmath92 .",
    "such a @xmath89 $ ] fits the condition @xmath95 $ ] . but calculations ( see below ) show that exactly at @xmath89 = { \\tilde a}_2/2 { \\tilde b}_2 $ ] the adst may not exist .",
    "if it does nt , it is nt in the equivalence class for @xmath85 .",
    "then we are not dealing with a conventional resonance @xmath96 $ ] and the term _ resonance _ is inappropriate .",
    "depolarisation in this model has also been attributed to the fact that for non  zero @xmath87 the eigentune of the 1turn spin map , which depends on @xmath67 , is 1/2 at some values of @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "however , such a quantity does not describe spin  orbit coherence .",
    "snake `` resonances '' are usually associated with acceleration but it has been helpful in other circumstances @xcite to begin by studying the _",
    "static _ properties of the system , namely with the isf .",
    "we now do that for the srm with two snakes for representative , parameters .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath35 ( just before a snake ) and @xmath79 for 25000 equally spaced @xmath89 $ ] s between 0 and 0.5 for @xmath97 and @xmath72 . at each @xmath89 $ ]",

    "thus the existence of an adst is easily checked .",

    "the curved line shows @xmath35 and the second row of dots from the bottom marks @xmath89 $ ] values where the isf obtained by stroboscopic averaging did not converge for all phases .",
    "these coincide with sharp dips in @xmath35 and are at or near @xmath89 = { \\tilde a}_2/2 { \\tilde b}_2 $ ] , i.e in the snake `` resonance '' subset of the @xmath89 $ ] s in the first row .",
    "thus snake `` resonance '' is already a static phenomenon .",
    "near such @xmath89 $ ] s , the isf , which for just one orbital mode is a closed curve in three dimensions , becomes extremely complicated as @xmath13 strives to satisfy its defining conditions .",

    "this shows the components of the isf for @xmath89 = 1/6 $ ] and @xmath97 . in this case",
    "they are obtained by using the 6turn spin map to calculate the vector @xmath13 in the range @xmath118 \\le   1/{2 \\tilde b}_2 $ ] , namely 0 to 60 degrees , while applying the constraint that @xmath13 should be continuous in @xmath67 .",
    "then the @xmath13 for each @xmath67 in this range is transported with the 1turn spin map for six , or more , turns .",
    "one sees that @xmath13 changes sign at values of @xmath67 which are multiples of 60 degrees so that the isf is discontinuous as advertised .",
    "the six sets of stray points at @xmath108 = 1/12 , 1/4 \\dots$ ] are at phases @xmath67 where the 6turn spin map is the identity . at these phases @xmath13 obtained in this way",
    "is arbitrary and the algorithm delivers values dominated by numerical noise .",
    "of course , if the isf is represented as the locus of points on the surface of the unit 2sphere , this isf gives disjoint segments .",
    "it is also easy to demonstrate that the positions of the discontinuities can be shifted .",
    "thus at snake `` resonances '' the invariant spin field is not only discontinuous but also _ non  unique _ and to an extent which goes far beyond the non  uniqueness at the phases @xmath67 at which the 6turn spin map is the identity .",
    "the isf shows analogous behaviour at other snake `` resonances '' .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the case , say , of the pure srm .",
    "note that discontinuities would not be allowed for irrational @xmath89 $ ] , but that they are not prohibited for rational @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "moreover , theorems on uniqueness of the isf require the existence of a spin tune and that the system is away from orbital resonance .",
    "of course , for snake `` resonances '' with very high values of @xmath92 , the isf and the corresponding configuration of equilibrium polarisation is very complicated .",
    "it is then far from clear whether the isf is a useful concept for these simple models involving just one plane of orbital motion and singular , i.e. , non  physical fields , although , of course , such models have been instrumental in presaging the loss of polarisation observed in real storage rings @xcite .",
    "the isf obtained from the real eigenvector of the multi ",
    "turn spin map is also non ",
    "unique for @xmath89 = { \\tilde a}_2/4 { \\tilde b}_2 $ ] , namely at those @xmath108 $ ] where the @xmath119turn spin map is the identity .",
    "moreover , additional discontinuities in the sign can be added by hand , thereby enhancing the choice of isf s .",
    "but in contrast to the case of snake `` resonances '' such discontinuities remain optional .",
    "further aspects of these matters will be reported elsewhere .",
    "it is instructive to compare the discontinuous curves in figure 2 with the smooth curves in figures 7 and 8 in @xcite .",
    "these are also said to represent isf s at snake `` resonances '' .",
    "the vectors corresponding to the curves in figure 2 satisfy the t  bmt equation by construction and they are single valued in @xmath108 $ ] as required for an isf .",
    "however , if the vectors for the curves in figures 7 and 8 in @xcite are transported according to the t  bmt equation , they are not single valued in @xmath108 $ ] . alternatively ,",
    "if those curves are taken to represent single  valued functions of @xmath120}$ ] , as depicted , then they do not represent spin motion , i.e. , motion according to the t  bmt equation .",
    "either way , the curves in those figures do not represent isf s at snake `` resonances '' .",
    "a snake `` resonance '' is at root a _ static _",
    "phenomenon characterised by an invariant spin field which , for the simple models discussed here , is irreducibly discontinuous in @xmath67 for most orbital amplitudes .",
    "moreover , on and near snake `` resonance '' , there is no amplitude dependent spin tune so that the snake `` resonances '' of these models are not simple spin  orbit resonances .",
    "the mechanism , in terms of @xmath16 , for polarisation loss during acceleration through @xmath72 at and near such @xmath89 $ ] s is under study .",
