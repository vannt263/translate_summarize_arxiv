    "since we are dealing with straight ( non - skew ) shapes , we know by corollary [ cor : lsfirst ] that the snake sequence has all the l s before any of the r s , or @xmath279 .",

    "let @xmath283 be the smallest label which is repeated .",
    "the intervals in @xmath80 are ordered by where they start , so identifying the first two intervals @xmath12 and @xmath107 ( @xmath280 ) labelled by @xmath283 is well - defined",
    ".    simply change the interval @xmath284 to @xmath285 and the interval @xmath286 to @xmath287 , while preserving the label @xmath283 on both . where the intervals start remains unchanged , so these intervals remain the first two intervals labelled by @xmath283 .",
    "hence this operation is an involution .",
    "note that if the two intervals initially nested , they now intersect , and if they initially intersected , they now nest .",

    "similarly if @xmath305 we will get @xmath306 , and if @xmath307 we will get @xmath308 . finally if the three labels are all different , the sum will give @xmath309 . so the sum over all such labellings is @xmath310 .",

    "so the @xmath12th interval is well defined , and has length @xmath312 .    by definition @xmath313 .",
    "but if we expand this product into monomials @xmath314 , each monomial corresponds uniquely to the labelling of @xmath80 where the @xmath107th interval is labelled by @xmath315 , and so occurs exactly once in @xmath316 as required .",

    "note that if @xmath323 , the two labellings @xmath324 and @xmath325 both produce the same term @xmath326 .",

    "let @xmath338 denote the space of all symmetric functions @xmath339 with rational coefficients such that if @xmath340 , then @xmath341 theorem  [ th : identity ] shows that @xmath342 . however , there are elements of @xmath338 that are not linear combinations of @xmath0 s , such as @xmath343 .",
