    "it is commonly accepted that rocky planets form by the process of collisional agglomeration of smaller bodies ( for recent reviews , see chambers 2004 , nagasawa 2007 or raymond 2008 ) .",
    "this process starts from micron - sized dust grains in young circumstellar disks , and the current paradigm proceeds as follows .",
    "grains settle to a thin disk midplane on a @xmath1 year timescale ( weidenschilling 1980 ) , and grow quickly via sticky collisions until they reach cm- or m- sizes ( dullemond & dominik 2004 ) .",
    "the time for m - sized bodies to spiral in to the star is very short ( @xmath2 100 years ) such that this size range constitutes a barrier to further growth ( weidenschilling 1977a ) .",
    "this barrier may be crossed by rapid accretion ( weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ; benz 2000 ) or by local gravitational instability ( goldreich & ward 1973 ; youdin & shu 2002 ) , which can be triggered by turbulent concentration ( johansen 2007 ; cuzzi 2008 ) . larger bodies ( 100 m to 100 km in size ) , which are more weakly coupled to the gaseous disk , are called planetesimals .",
    "runaway growth of the largest planetesimals may occur while the velocity dispersion is small because of strong gravitational focusing such that @xmath3 ( safronov 1969 ; greenberg 1978 ) . however , viscous stirring by the large bodies increases the velocity dispersion of planetesimals , thereby reducing the growth rate to a roughly geometrical regime , where @xmath4 ( ida & makino 1993 ) .",
    "dynamical friction acts on the oligarchs , maintaining small eccentricities ( ida & makino 1992 ; kokubo & ida 1998 ) . the building blocks of the terrestrial planets , @xmath2moon - sized planetary embryos , form in @xmath5 years with a characteristic spacing of 5 - 10 mutual hill radii ( wetherill & stewart 1993 ; weidenschilling 1997 ; kokubo & ida 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "giant collisions between planetary embryos begin to occur when the local density of planetesimals and embryos is comparable ( wetherill 1985 ; kenyon & bromley 2006 ) . during late - stage accretion ,",
    "embryo - planetesimal and embryo - embryo impacts are common and the feeding zones of terrestrial planets can span several au in width ( raymond 2006a ) . late - stage accretion lasts for @xmath6 years and sets the final bulk architecture of the system as well as the composition of the terrestrial planets ( e.g. , wetherill 1996 ) .",
    "past simulations of late - stage accretion have succeeded in reproducing several aspects of the solar system s terrestrial planets . using only 20 - 165 particles , agnor ( 1999 ) and chambers ( 2001 ) roughly reproduced the approximate masses and semimajor axes of mercury , venus , earth and mars .",
    "thommes ( 2008 ) also reproduced the rough mass distribution of the inner solar system by invoking sweeping secular resonances during the depletion of the solar nebula . by taking dynamical friction from remnant planetesimals into account , obrien ( 2006 ) and morishima ( 2008 ) reproduced the very low eccentricities of the terrestrial planets .",
    "several groups have succeeded in delivering water to earth from hydrated asteroidal material , following the model of morbidelli ( 2000 ; see also raymond 2004 , 2006a , 2007 ; obrien 2006 ) .    despite these achievements",
    ", no previous study has adequately reproduced all aspects of the inner solar system .",
    "indeed , as pointed out by wetherill ( 1991 ) , mars small size remains the most difficult constraint to reproduce ( also discussed in chambers 2001 ) .",
    "agnor ( 1999 ) , chambers ( 2001 ) and morishima ( 2008 ) succeeded in reproducing mars small size only because their simulations started from an annulus of material with a fixed width ( see also kominami & ida 2002 ) . in most cases this annulus extended from 0.5 - 1.5",
    "au , such that a small planet could form at the outer edge of the initial disk because of spreading .",
    "however , no such edge is thought to have existed in the solar nebula , so that the assumption that the planetesimal and embryo population extended only to 1.5 au is not justified . chambers ( 2001 ) managed to place mercury within a planetary mass distribution but only by adopting an ad - hoc inner disk profile . thommes ( 2008 ) formed a small mars but the orbits they assumed for jupiter and saturn are inconsistent with any significant late , planetesimal - driven migration of the giant planets ( discussed at length in  6.2 below ) .",
    "in fact , the scenario of thommes ( 2008 ) is incompatible with the two currently viable theories for the late heavy bombardments because these require either a more compact configuration of jupiter and saturn ( gomes 2005 ) or the formation of a small , sub - mars - sized planet at @xmath2 2 au ( chambers 2007 ) .",
    "terrestrial accretion lasts for @xmath6 years , far longer than the few myr lifetimes of the gaseous component of protoplanetary disks ( haisch 2001 ; briceo 2001 ; pascucci 2006 ) .",
    "thus , gas giant planets must be fully - formed during late - stage accretion and can therefore strongly affect terrestrial bodies , especially if the giant planets orbits are eccentric ( wetherill 1996 ; chambers & cassen 2002 ; levison & agnor 2003 ; raymond 2004 ; obrien 2006 ) . given that substantial orbital migration of the solar system s giant planets has been proposed to explain the structure of the kuiper belt ( fernandez & ip 1984 ; malhotra 1995 ) and the origin of the late heavy bombardment ( strom 2005 ; gomes 2005 ) , the orbits of jupiter and saturn at early times are unclear .",
    "indeed , a range of jupiter - saturn configurations could yield the current solar system .",
    "thus , if any particular configuration were especially adept at reproducing the terrestrial planets , it would provide strong circumstantial evidence in favor of that configuration .    in this paper",
    "we attempt to reproduce the inner solar system with a suite of high - resolution ( n = 1000 - 2000 ) dynamical simulations of late - stage accretion .",
    "we only vary one parameter of consequence : the configuration of jupiter and saturn at early times .",
    "we quantify five relevant constraints that we use to test our models in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we outline our choices of initial conditions and numerical methods . in section 4",
    "we explore the case of two contrasting simulations that each reproduce certain constraints .",
    "we present results and analysis of all simulations in section 5 .",
    "we discuss these results and present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we consider five broad attributes which we attempt to reproduce statistically with accretion simulations . other observations and measurements exist for inner solar system bodies , but we are limiting ourselves to relatively broad and well - understood characteristics .",
    "these constraints are described below in order from strongest to weakest .",
    "weaker constraints rely on models or data that are subject to interpretation , while strong constraints are directly observed .",
    "we use several quantities to compare our simulations with the solar system s terrestrial planets .",
    "these include statistical measures that were introduced by chambers ( 2001 ) .    1 .   the masses and the mass distribution of the terrestrial planets .",
    "as mentioned above , the mass distribution of the terrestrial planets , and in particular the small masses of mercury and mars , have not been adequately reproduced in the context of the entire solar system and its history . in this paper",
    "we do not attempt to reproduce mercury because its small size and large iron content may be the result of a mantle - stripping impact ( benz 1988 ) or interesting composition - sorting gaseous effects ( weidenschilling 1978 ) .",
    "however , for the case of mars , with its more distant orbit , these effects are less likely to be a factor , and it should be reproducible in the context of our simulations .",
    "in addition , the distribution of mass in the inner solar system is interesting because the majority is concentrated between the orbits of venus and earth .",
    "we therefore use two statistical measures for this constraint : * the number of planets formed @xmath7 .",
    "we take @xmath7 to represent objects that contain at least one planetary embryo , that have semimajor axes @xmath8 2 au , and that are on long - term stable orbits .",
    "it is only for these planets that we apply our other measures . *",
    "a radial mass concentration statistic @xmath9 ( called @xmath10 in chambers 2001 ) : @xmath11 ^ 2 } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the masses and semimajor axes of each planet .",
    "the function in brackets is calculated for @xmath14 throughout the terrestrial planet zone , and @xmath10 is the maximum of that function .",
    "this quantity represents the degree to which mass is concentrated in a small radial annulus : @xmath10 remains small for a system of many equal - mass planets but @xmath10 is large for systems with few planets and with most of the mass in one or two planets .",
    "for a one planet system , the @xmath9 value is infinite .",
    "the @xmath9 of the solar system s terrestrial planets is 89.9 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "2 .   the orbits of the terrestrial planets .",
    "the terrestrial planets maintain very small orbital eccentricities and inclinations over long timescales .",
    "earth and venus time - averaged eccentricities are only about 0.03 ( e.g. , quinn 1991 ) .",
    "recent simulations with @xmath15 particles have succeeded in reproducing these small eccentricities for the first time ( obrien 2006 ) .",
    "we quantify the orbital excitation of the terrestrial planets using the normalized angular momentum deficit @xmath16 ( laskar 1997 ) .",
    "this measures the difference in angular momentum of a set of orbits from coplanar , circular orbits : @xmath17 where @xmath13 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 refer to planet @xmath21 s semimajor axis , eccentricity , inclination with respect to a fiducial plane , and mass .",
    "the @xmath16 of the solar system s terrestrial planets is 0.0018 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the formation timescales of earth and mars .",
    "recent interpretation of hf / w measurements suggest that the last core - formation event on earth occurred at roughly 50 - 150 myr ( touboul 2007 ) this event is thought to be the moon - forming impact ( benz 1986 ; canup & asphaug 2001 ) .",
    "mars formation time from hf / w isotopes appears to be significantly shorter , about 1 - 10 myr ( nimmo & kleine 2007 ) .",
    "4 .   the large - scale structure of the asteroid belt .",
    "the asteroid belt shows a clear division between inner , s - types and more distant c - types ( e.g. , gradie & tedesco 1982 ) .",
    "in addition , there are no large gaps in the main belt except those caused by specific mean motion or secular resonances .",
    "if a planetary embryo above a critical mass were stranded in the asteroid belt for a long period of time , it would disrupt both of these observed characteristics by planetesimal scattering ( obrien , in preparation ) .",
    "this constraint puts an upper limit of a few lunar masses ( @xmath22 ) on the mass of an object that can survive in the asteroid belt after terrestrial planet formation .",
    "if an embryo did end up in the main belt , it could have been subsequently removed during the late heavy bombardment ( gomes 2005 ; strom 2005 ) , but the embryo s dynamical imprint on the asteroid belt would have remained .",
    "we note that the asteroid belt is thought have been depleted by a factor of @xmath1 in mass over the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "this depletion is best explained by scattering of planetesimals by planetary embryos in the primordial belt ( wetherill 1992 ; chambers & wetherill 2001 ; petit 2001 ; obrien 2007 ) , although other models do exist ( e.g. , lecar & franklin 1997 ; nagasawa 2000 ) .",
    "scattering among embryos often places one body in an unstable mean motion resonances with jupiter , leading to their rapid removal from the belt .",
    "this scattering also leads to some radial mixing , consistent with the observation that the different asteroid taxonomic types are not confined to narrow zones , but are spread somewhat in overlapping but still distinct regions ( gradie & tedesco 1982 ) .",
    "embryos as small as the moon are able to provide the necessary excitation ( chambers & wetherill 2001 ) .",
    "most of the embryos are removed on a timescale of @xmath2 10 myr . however",
    ", if one or more stray embryos with too large of a mass remain in the belt for much longer than this , they will lead to excessive radial mixing , inconsistent with the observed distribution of different asteroid taxonomic types .",
    "figure  [ fig : astemb ] shows the effect of a mars - mass embryo trapped at 2.5 au on 100 myr of evolution of 1000 asteroids in the main belt ( 2 - 3.5 au ) , which are assumed to be massless .",
    "two features from fig .",
    "[ fig : astemb ] are inconsistent with the observed main belt : the excess radial mixing and the gap created in the vicinity of the embryo .",
    "more massive or more eccentric asteroidal embryos can be significantly more disruptive than the case from fig .",
    "[ fig : astemb ] , especially if their eccentricity is strongly forced by secular perturbations from jupiter and saturn ( obrien , in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , the simulation from fig .  [ fig : astemb ] was only run for 100 myr , roughly 500 myr shorter than the relevant timescale , i.e. , the time between the completion of terrestrial accretion ( @xmath2 100 myr ) and the time of the late heavy bombardment ( 600 - 700 myr ) .",
    "thus , the constraint we place on our accretion simulations is that no embryos larger than 0.05 @xmath23 can survive in the main belt past the end of terrestrial planet growth , or in our case @xmath24 years .",
    "earth s water content .",
    "one prominent model suggests that primitive asteroidal material was the source of the bulk of earth s water ( morbidelli 2000 ; see also raymond 2007 ) .",
    "this model explains why the d / h ratio of earth s water matches that of carbonaceous chondrites ( robert & epstein 1982 ; kerridge 1985 ) , and links earth s water to the depletion of the primitive asteroid belt .",
    "note that other models exist which propose that earth s water came from comets ( delsemme 1994 ; owen & bar - nun 1995 ) , from oxidation of a primitive , h - rich atmosphere ( ikoma & genda 2006 ) , from adsorption of water onto small grains at 1 au ( muralidharan 2008 ) , or from other sources  see morbidelli ( 2000 ) for a discussion of some of these models .",
    "however , it is our opinion that the asteroidal water model of morbidelli ( 2000 ) is the most likely source of earth s water .",
    "in fact , water vapor from sublimation of in - spiraling icy bodies has been detected interior to 1 au in the protoplanetary disk around the young star mwc480 ( eisner 2007 ) ; this may be an observation of asteroidal ( or in this case potentially cometary ) water delivery in action .",
    "our simulations are designed to start at the beginning of late - stage accretion , after jupiter and saturn are fully - formed and the nebular gas has dissipated .",
    "this is probably 1 - 3 myr after `` time zero , '' and we base our initial conditions on models of the formation of planetary embryos ( e.g. , kokubo & ida 2000 ) .",
    "we start with a disk of planetary embryos and planetesimals , plus jupiter and saturn .",
    "our simulations are comparable to the highest - resolution cases in the literature , containing 85 - 90 planetary embryos and 1000 - 2000 planetesimals .",
    "the resonant structure of the kuiper belt appears to require a significant outward migration of neptune ( fernandez & ip 1984 ; malhotra 1995 ; gomes 2003 ; levison & morbidelli 2003 ) .",
    "this outward migration occurred because of the back - reaction from planetesimal scattering , which causes the orbits of saturn , uranus and neptune to expand and the orbit of jupiter to contract ( fernandez & ip 1984 ) .",
    "in addition , the `` nice model '' of giant planet evolution , which explains several observed characteristics of the solar system , proposes that jupiter and saturn formed interior to their mutual 2:1 mean motion resonance , perhaps in fact in the 3:2 resonance and migrated apart ( tsiganis 2005 ; gomes 2005 ; morbidelli 2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "thus , jupiter and saturn may very well have been in a more compact configuration at early times .",
    "we tested a range of configurations for jupiter and saturn , although we did not perform an exhaustive search given the large computational expense of each simulation .",
    "however , to account for stochastic variations in outcome we performed 4 simulations for each giant planet configuration .",
    "the configurations we tested were :    * cjs ( `` circular jupiter and saturn '' ) .",
    "these are the initial conditions for the nice model , as in tsiganis ( 2005 ) and also used in obrien ( 2006 ) .",
    "jupiter and saturn were placed on circular orbits with semimajor axes of 5.45 and 8.18 au and a mutual inclination of 0.5 degrees .",
    "we note that even though jupiter and saturn begin with zero eccentricities , they induce small , non - zero eccentricities in each others orbits . *",
    "jupiter and saturn were placed at their cjs semimajor axes of 5.45 and 8.18 au with @xmath25 0.02 and @xmath26 0.03 and a mutual inclination of 0.5 degrees .",
    "* ejs ( `` eccentric jupiter and saturn '' ) .",
    "jupiter and saturn were placed on approximately their current orbits : @xmath27 = 5.25 au , @xmath28 = 0.05 , @xmath29 = 9.54 au , and @xmath30 = 0.06 , with a mutual inclination of 1.5 degrees . * eejs ( `` extra eccentric jupiter and saturn '' ) .",
    "jupiter and saturn were placed at their current semimajor axes but with higher orbital eccentricities : @xmath27 = 5.25 au , @xmath29 = 9.54 au , and @xmath31 = 0.1 , with a mutual inclination of 1.5 degrees .",
    "these cases proved to be interesting , so we ran 8 cases in addition to the original four . the next four cases ( referred to as eejs 5 - 8 ) had the same configuration of jupiter and saturn but 2000 planetesimals rather than 1000 .",
    "the final four cases ( eejs 9 - 12 ) also had 2000 planetesimals but had @xmath25 0.07 and @xmath26 0.08 . * jsres ( `` jupiter and saturn in resonance '' ) .",
    "jupiter and saturn were placed in their mutual 3:2 mean motion resonance , following directly from simulations of their evolution in the gaseous solar nebula ( morbidelli 2007 ) : @xmath27 = 5.43 au , @xmath29 = 7.30 au , @xmath28 = 0.005 , and @xmath30 = 0.01 , with a mutual inclination of 0.2 degrees . * jsresecc ( `` jupiter and saturn in resonance on eccentric orbits '' ) . as for jsres but with @xmath31 = 0.03 .",
    "the ejs and eejs simulations assume that jupiter and saturn did not undergo any migration .",
    "the eejs simulations are more self - consistent than the ejs simulations , because scattering of remnant planetesimals and embryos tends to decrease the eccentricities and semimajor axes of jupiter and saturn ( e.g. , chambers 2001 ) .",
    "thus , to end up on their current orbits , jupiter and saturn would have had to form on more eccentric and slightly more distant orbits .",
    "the cjs , jsres and jsresecc simulations all follow from the nice model and assume that jupiter and saturn s orbits changed significantly after their formation , with saturn migrating outward and jupiter inward ( tsiganis 2005 ) . if migration of the giant planets is really associated with the late heavy bombardment ( gomes 2005 ; strom 2005 ) , then at least most of the migration of jupiter and saturn must have occurred late , well after the completion of the terrestrial planet formation process .      for all of our simulations ,",
    "the disk of solids extended from 0.5 to 4.5 au and contained populations of planetary embryos and planetesimals . for most cases , we assumed that the disk s surface density in solids @xmath32 followed a simple radial power - law distribution : @xmath33 for the minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) model , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( weidenschilling 1977a ; hayashi 1981 ) .",
    "for most of our simulations we assumed @xmath35 but we also performed some cases with @xmath36 for the cjs and ejs giant planet configuration .",
    "cases with @xmath36 are labeled by the @xmath37 value ; for example , the ejs15 simulations have @xmath35 and the ejs1 simulations have @xmath36 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "for each case , we calibrated our disks to contain a total of 5 @xmath23 in solids between 0.5 and 4.5 au , divided equally between the planetesimal and embryo components .",
    "figure  [ fig : init ] shows a sample set of initial conditions .",
    "we assumed that embryos are spaced by @xmath38 3 - 6 mutual hill radii @xmath39 , where @xmath40^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the radial distance and mass of embryo 1 .",
    "the embryo mass therefore scales with orbital distance as @xmath43 ( kokubo & ida 2002 ; raymond 2005 ) .",
    "the disks contained 85 - 90 embryos with masses between 0.005 and 0.1 @xmath23 .",
    "in mars vicinity the typical embryo mass was roughly 1/6 to 1/3 of a mars mass .",
    "planetesimals were laid out as @xmath44 to follow the annular mass , and had masses of 0.0025 @xmath23 .",
    "embryos and planetesimals were given randomly - chosen starting eccentricities of less than 0.02 and inclinations of less than 0.5@xmath45 .",
    "in a few eejs cases we performed additional simulations with 2000 planetesimals , which followed the same distribution but had correspondingly smaller masses .",
    "we assume that there existed a radial compositional gradient for rocky bodies in the solar nebula .",
    "this gradient was presumably imprinted on planetesimals by the local temperature during their formation ( e.g. , boss 1998 ) , although heating by short - lived radionuclides such as @xmath46al may have played a role ( grimm & mcsween 1993 ) .",
    "we assume the same water distribution as in raymond ( 2004 , 2006a ) , using data for primitive meteorites from abe ( 2000 ) .",
    "the `` water mass fraction '' , @xmath47 , i.e. the water content by mass , varies with radial distance @xmath48 as : @xmath49    this water distribution is imprinted on planetesimals and embryos at the start of each simulation . during accretion",
    "the water content of each body is calculated by a simple mass balance of all the accreted bodies .",
    "we do not take into account water loss during giant impacts ( genda & abe 2005 ; canup & pierazzo 2006 ) or via hydrodynamic escape ( matsui & abe 1986 ; kasting 1988 ) .",
    "each simulation was integrated for at least 200 myr using the hybrid symplectic integrator mercury ( chambers 1999 ) .",
    "we used a 6-day timestep for all integrations ; numerical tests show that this is adequate to resolve the innermost orbits in our simulations and to avoid any substantial error buildup ( see rauch & holman 1999 ) .",
    "collisions are treated as inelastic mergers , and we assumed physical densities of @xmath50 for all embryos and planetesimals .",
    "simulations were run on individual machines in a distributed computing environment , and required 2 - 4 months per simulation .",
    "the sun s radius was artificially increased to 0.1 au to avoid numerical error for small - perihelion orbits .",
    "for each jupiter - saturn - disk configuration we performed four different simulations to account for the stochastic nature of accretion ( e.g. , chambers & wetherill 1998 ) .",
    "these four cases varied in terms of the random number used to initialize our disk code , resulting in differences in the detailed initial distributions of embryos and planetesimals .",
    "embryo particles interacted gravitationally with all other bodies but planetesimal particles did not interact with each other .",
    "this approximation was made to reduce the run time needed per simulation which is already considerable ( see raymond 2006a for a discussion of this issue ) . the run time @xmath51 scales with the number of embryos @xmath52 and the number of planetesimals , @xmath7 ,",
    "roughly as @xmath53 .",
    "the non - interaction of planetesimals eliminates an additional @xmath54 term .",
    "note that @xmath51 refers to the computing time needed for a given timestep .",
    "the total runtime is @xmath51 integrated over all timesteps for all surviving particles .",
    "thus , a key element in the actual runtime of a simulation is the mean particle lifetime .",
    "configurations with strong external perturbations ( e.g. , eccentric giant planets ) tend to run faster because the mean particle lifetime is usually shorter than for configurations with weak external perturbations .",

    "[ fig : aet_jsres ] ) , eccentricities are excited in the inner disk by interactions between embryos and planetesimals . in the outer disk ,",
    "eccentricities are excited by specific mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) with jupiter and saturn : the 3:1 , 2:1 and 3:2 mmrs are clearly visible .",
    "eccentric embryos perturb nearby bodies and act to spread out the resonant excitation on a myr timescale .",
    "a stage of chaotic growth lasts for @xmath2100 myr . during this time , there is substantial mixing of objects between radial zones , the inner system is cleared of small bodies , and four water - rich planets are formed inside 2 au with masses between 0.36 and 0.95 @xmath23 ( see table 1 ) .    in the eejs simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aet_eejs ] ) , the inner and outer portions of the disk are quickly divided by a strong secular resonance near 2 au ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the evolution of the inner disk proceeds in similar fashion to the jsres simulation , although eccentricities are higher because of excitation by another secular resonance at 0.7 au ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the asteroid belt region was cleared more quickly than for the jsres case due to stronger secular and resonant perturbations .",
    "the stage of chaotic growth also lasts about 10@xmath64 years but with less mixing between radial zones . at the end of the simulation ,",
    "three mainly dry planets have formed within 2 au .",

    "figure  [ fig : fzone ] ( top panels ) shows the mass of the planets over the 200 myr span of the simulation for the two simulations .",
    "planetary growth is a combination of relatively smooth accumulation from a large number of planetesimals and punctuated accretion from a small number of giant impacts with other embryos . in general , embryo - embryo collisions increase in magnitude in time simply because all embryos are growing .",
    "this is particularly clear for the case of the innermost planet ( 0.59 au ) in the jsres simulation which was hit by a 0.41 @xmath23 embryo at 94.8 myr while the planet was only 0.48 @xmath23 .",
    "the timescale for the last giant impact on the jsres planets was 43 - 160 myr , and 0.17 - 82 myr for the eejs planets .",
    "the earth analog ( i.e. , the planet closest to 1 au ) in each simulation fell slightly out of the 50 - 150 myr window for the last giant impact on earth ( touboul 2007 ) , but on different sides . the jsres earth analog s last giant impact was slightly too late ( 160 myr ) while the eejs earth analog s was too early ( 35.6 myr ) .",
    "the mars analog in the jsres simulation ( at 1.42 au ) has a mass that is roughly eight times too large and a formation timescale that is far too long ( 124 myr as compared with the hf / w isotopic age of 1 - 10 myr ; nimmo & kleine 2007 ) .",
    "in contrast , the eejs simulation produced an excellent mars analog that is actually somewhat smaller than mars ( 0.06 @xmath23 vs. 0.11 @xmath23 ) and whose only giant impact occurred 168,000 years into the simulation .",
    "given that the `` time zero '' for our simulations is probably 1 - 3 myr after the formation of the solar nebula , this is consistent with isotopic measurements .",
    "it is interesting to note that the last giant impact on the innermost planet in each simulation occurred quite late , at @xmath6 years ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the reason for the late impact was different for the two simulations .",
    "for the jsres simulation the last giant impactor originated in the asteroid belt , where the timescale for close encounters and scattering is longer than the inner system .",
    "for the eejs simulation , the last giant impactor originated at 1.2 au but had its inclination increased by a short time spent in the vicinity of the @xmath62 secular resonance , thereby prolonging its dynamical lifetime in the inner system .",
    "these late giant impacts on close - in planets contrast with the nominal view of accretion occurring fastest in the inner regions of the disk , especially given the much shorter accretion timescales for the earth and mars analogs in the eejs simulation .",
    "the feeding zones of the planets from the jsres and eejs simulations are shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fzone ] .",
    "feeding zones were calculated as the fraction of material incorporated into each planet that originated in each 0.45 au - wide radial bin .",
    "the feeding zones of all planets overlap in each simulation , although the width of individual feeding zones vary . in the jsres simulation",
    "each of the four planets accreted material from a radial width of more than 3 au .",
    "given that the source of water lies beyond 2 - 2.5 au , this explains the large water abundance in the jsres planets .",
    "the earth analog s feeding zone is exceedingly wide and is unusual in that its accretion seed actually started the simulation in the outer asteroid belt , at 4.3 au .",
    "the earth analog s water content was therefore very large , roughly 30 times the earth s current water content without accounting for any water loss ( the earth s @xmath47 is @xmath65 ; lecuyer 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast , the three planets from the eejs simulations each had feeding zones of less than 1.7 au in width . very little material from exterior to 2 au was incorporated into the eejs planets , with the notable exception of one embryo that originated at 2.64 au and was the accretion seed of the mars analog .",
    "thus , the earth and venus analogs are very dry , but the mars analog is very water - rich .    the jsres and eejs simulations each reproduced some of our constraints but neither reproduced them all .",
    "the jsres simulation formed a terrestrial planet system with eccentricities and inclinations almost as low as the solar system s terrestrial planets , with an @xmath16 of 0.0023 ( as compared with 0.0018 for mercury , venus , earth and mars ",
    "hereafter mvem ) .",
    "the jsres planets also contain abundant water that was delivered from the primordial asteroid belt .",
    "the formation timescale of the earth analog is roughly consistent with isotopic constraints for earth .",
    "however , the jsres mars analog bears little resemblance to the real planet in terms of its mass and formation timescale .",
    "in addition , three extra large bodies exist at the end of the simulation : a 0.36 @xmath23 planet at 1.8 au and two embryos in the asteroid belt totaling 0.11 @xmath23 . these remnant bodies , in particular the embryos in the asteroid belt , are inconsistent with the observed inner solar system .",
    "the eejs planets are novel among accretion simulations of this kind because they contain a reasonable mars analog in terms of its mass , orbit and formation timescale .",
    "in addition , the approximate masses and spacing of the eejs planets are close to those of venus , earth and mars . no embryos are stranded in the asteroid belt although a dozen planetesimals remain in the belt .",
    "however , the eejs earth analog s formation timescale is too short by @xmath2 20% .",
    "more importantly , the @xmath16 for the system is 0.0086 , roughly 5 times higher than the mvem value . finally , the earth analog is almost completely devoid of asteroidal water and thus requires an alternate source .",
    "the values of the radial mass concentration statistic @xmath9 of both simulations are far lower than for the inner solar system .",

    ", collisions can only occur at @xmath72 .",
    "planetesimal - embryo impacts ( small symbols in fig .",

[ fig : coll ] ) can result in either partial accretion or even erosion .",
    "agnor & asphaug ( 2004 ) showed that accretionary collisions only occur at @xmath73 and preferentially for small impact angles . the majority of giant impacts ( filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : coll ] ) occur at low speeds and should therefore be accretionary . indeed , the majority of impacts lie in the accretionary regime as defined by agnor & asphaug ( 2004 ) : 60% , 71% , 71% , and 75% for the four planets from the jsres simulation ( listed from closest- to farthest from the sun ) , and 83% , 100% and 0% for the three eejs planets . and",
    "was hit by a 0.015 @xmath23 embryo .",
    "the collision was nearly head - on ( sintheta = 0.14 ) but high - speed ( @xmath74 = 5.2 ) .",
    "] this is a larger fraction than the 55% found by agnor ( 1999 ) and the @xmath2 half inferred by agnor & asphaug ( 2004 ) .",
    "we assume that dynamical friction from small bodies reduced the mean impact speed and increased the fraction of accretionary impacts .",
    "we note , however , that the definition of an accretionary impact only requires that the collision produce an object larger than either of the two impactors , not that the object s mass equal the sum of the colliding masses .",
    "in particular , each of our example simulations has a cluster of impacts at low velocity but large angle ( see discussion in section 5 ) . a large number of fragments is probably produced in these off - center collisions ( asphaug 2006 ) .",
    "we do not have the ability to track the effect of these fragments , which could be important ( see discussion in section 6 ) . on the other hand",
    ", an erosive , `` hit and run '' collision usually results in an extra body that looks very similar to the original impactor and can easily be accreted in a later collision involving that extra body ( asphaug 2006 ) .",
    "the different outcomes in the eejs and jsres example simulations can be attributed to differences in eccentricity and inclination excitation by specific resonances with jupiter and saturn , as well as by secular perturbations from jupiter and saturn .",
    "figure  [ fig : ae_tp ] shows the eccentricities of test particles on initially circular orbits after 1 myr of evolution in each giant planet system , with no embryos present . for the jsres case ,",
    "the amount of eccentricity excitation is small .",
    "the main sources of excitation are the @xmath63 secular resonance at 1.3 au and the 2:1 mmr with jupiter at 3.4 au .",
    "the 3:1 and 3:2 mmrs with jupiter are faintly visible at 2.6 au and 4.1 au .",
    "the small amount of external forcing means that the self - scattering of embryos and planetesimals is the dominant source of eccentricity in the jsres simulations .",
    "given that the disk is continuous and contains a significant amount of mass in the mars region , no dynamical mechanism exists to remove that mass .",
    "in addition , the weak influence of the giant planets allows for efficient delivery of water - rich material via a large number of relatively weak embryo - embryo and embryo - planetesimal scattering events ( raymond 2007 ) .    in contrast",
    ", perturbations from jupiter and saturn play a dominant role in the eejs configuration .",
    "strong secular resonances are visible at 0.7 au ( @xmath63 ) and 2.2 au ( @xmath62 ) . in addition , secular excitation is strong enough to impart a typical free eccentricity of 0.1 - 0.2 throughout the inner solar system .",
    "the @xmath62 secular resonance is directly responsible for mars small size , as it efficiently removes mass from the 1.5 - 2.5 au region , mainly by driving eccentricities of bodies to 1 and inducing collisions with the sun .",
    "however , the @xmath62 acts as a barrier between the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt , such that water delivery is severely reduced .",
    "the strong eccentricity forcing throughout the inner solar system appears to prevent low-@xmath16 terrestrial planets from forming .",
    "however , the scattering of embryos and planetesimals by jupiter and saturn throughout accretion reduces the giant planets eccentricities and weakens their secular perturbations in time .    despite the differences between the jsres and eejs simulations , it is important to realize that small secular perturbations from the giant planets do not necessarily correlate with low - amd terrestrial planets , especially in the case of limited numerical resolution .",
    "in fact , obrien ( 2006 ) formed significantly lower-@xmath16 terrestrial planets for the ejs configuration than their cjs simulations .",
    "the reason for this is that the timescale for the removal of asteroidal material was very long for the cjs simulations , and close encounters with late - arriving material from the asteroid belt tended to increase eccentricities .",
    "in contrast , their ejs simulations cleared out the asteroid belt quickly and the secular forcing of eccentricities was small enough inside @xmath2 2 au that the giant planets did not act to increase the terrestrial planets @xmath16 .",
    "the evolution of each simulation proceeded in a qualitatively similar fashion to the example eejs or jsres simulations .",
    "in fact , the two cases illustrated in section 4 comprise the most extreme variations in our sample .",
    "the other cases lie between those extremes , typically with a moderate amount of excitation from the giant planets in the outer disk and relatively little external excitation in the inner disk . in this section",
    "we discuss the outcomes of our simulations in terms of how they compare with our solar system constraints .",
    "we explore how the differences between cases can be attributed to the giant planet configuration and , to a lesser degree , to variations in the disk s density profile .",
    "there was a large range in the characteristics of the terrestrial planet systems that formed .",
    "the number of planets in a given system ranged from 2 - 6 , where we define a planet to contain an least one embryo , to be interior to 2 au , and to be on a stable orbit that does not cross the orbit of any other planets or embryos . the total mass in planets varied by almost a factor of two , from 1.4 to 2.7 @xmath23 .",

    "if typical impact speeds or angles on mars analogs were much higher than for earth analogs , then the fraction of erosive collisions on mars analogs would be higher and one could claim that the mass ratio of mars- to earth - analogs in our simulations was too high . however , the distribution of collision velocities for earth and mars analogs is very similar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coll_all ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can rule out variations in impact properties as the source of large mars analogs in our simulations .",
    "one exception are the ejs simulations , many of which have somewhat higher impact speeds and angles for mars analogs than for earth analogs .",
    "for the ejs simulations , the mass of mars analogs may therefore be somewhat overestimated .",
    "canup ( 2004 ) showed that a very particular impact configuration was required to form the moon .",
    "such an impact must be low - velocity ( @xmath114 ) , off - center ( sin[theta ] between 0.67 and 0.76 ) , and have an impactor to target mass ratio between 0.11 and 0.15 .",
    "canup ( 2008 ) found that , for prograde rotation of the proto - earth , slightly smaller impactors can form moon - analogs , with a cutoff at roughly 0.1 . for retrograde rotation of the proto - earth , larger impactor - to - target mass ratios are allowed but ratios less than 0.1 are still unable to form the moon .",
    "we examined the last three giant impacts suffered by the earth analog in each simulation , and none of the impacts fulfilled canup s ( 2004 ) three requirements .",
    "in fact , none of the last three impacts on an earth analog had an impactor to target mass ratio larger than 0.05 for the right collision angle and speed .",
    "in addition , only 4% of the late giant impacts",
    "satisfied canup s velocity and angle criteria .",
    "we conclude that the earth s moon must be a cosmic rarity unless differences between planetary systems produce a systematic change in the likelihood of moon - forming impacts .",
    "however , we note that the simulations of canup ( 2004 , 2008 ) were specifically designed to reproduce the details of the earth - moon system , in particular its high specific angular momentum and the moon s small core .",
    "we suspect that a much larger range of late giant collisions would produce satellites , although their properties could be much different than the moon .",
    "as noted in section 4 , our simulations show a grouping of low - velocity grazing collisions .",
    "the difference between the velocity distributions at small and large angles is only significant for grazing collisions with sin ( theta ) @xmath115 0.9 , where the collisions that were registered by the code do indeed occur at lower speeds .",
    "when comparing the statistics of head - on ( sin [ theta ] @xmath116 0.7 ) and grazing ( sin [ theta ] @xmath115 0.9 ) collisions in all 40 simulations , there were no notable differences in terms of collision time , distance from the sun , or the details of the impactor .",
    "grazing collisions did , however , have target masses @xmath2 15% larger than for head - on collisions",
    ". statistically , one would expect collisions between equal - mass objects to have a wider distribution in sin(theta ) than for collisions with one dominant mass , although this also depends on the collision speed . the small mass ratio for the grazing collisions may explain the low collision speeds , simply because the two - body escape speed is larger than for unequal - mass objects .    it is possible that the mercury code ( chambers 1999 ) has difficulty registering high - speed grazing collisions because they could travel many hill radii in a single timestep",
    "for example , two bodies traveling with relative velocity of 10 @xmath117 travel 0.035 au with respect to each other in a single 6 day timestep . the earth s hill sphere @xmath39 is about 0.01 au , and approaches within @xmath118 are tracked numerically with the bulirsch - stoer method rather than the symplectic map .",
    "thus , any two objects that are flagged as having a close encounter will have their orbits faithfully resolved .",
    "however , if the two objects were never flagged to approach within @xmath118 then an encounter could be missed .",
    "if that were the case then we would expect to miss more collisions at small orbital distances because the hill sphere is smaller and relative velocities are larger .",
    "although our statistics are limited , we do nt see any evidence for this . on the other hand ,",
    "the easiest grazing collisions for mercury to find should be those between massive bodies traveling at low speeds , and we can think of no obvious physical reason that high - speed grazing collisions should not occur .",
    "thus , although we have not found any evidence of the code missing high - speed grazing collisions , we can not rule out the possibility .",
    "we expect that such collisions would likely result in a `` bounce '' rather than a collision ( asphaug 2006 ) , and that later lower - speed or head - on collisions , impacts that are certainly found by mercury , would be the ones to result in planetary growth .    the effect of varying the disk s surface density profile between @xmath119 ( i.e. , @xmath36 from eqn .",
    "3 ) and @xmath120 ( @xmath35 ) not insignificant , although we only varied this parameter for the cjs and ejs configurations of jupiter and saturn ( ejs1 and cjs1 had @xmath119 , ejs15 and cjs15 had @xmath120 ) .",
    "the properties of the cjs1 , cjs15 , ejs1 and ejs15 simulations are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the @xmath119 simulations formed slightly fewer planets , contained less total mass in planets , had longer formation timescales for earth and higher @xmath16 values for the final systems than the @xmath121 simulations .",
    "in addition , earth analogs in the ejs1 simulations contained far more water than earths in the ejs15 simulations .",
    "0.8 au in 3/4 cases .",
    "given that water delivery decreases with distance from the water source ( @xmath122 au ) , this decreased the water content of earth analogs in the cjs1 simulations .",
    "] these trends are consistent with the results of raymond ( 2005 ) , and appear to be due simply to the fact that the @xmath119 simulations contain far more mass in the asteroid region than the @xmath120 simulations . given that planets form largely from local material , the @xmath119 simulations contain less material in the inner disk and therefore form less massive planets .",
    "in addition , the relatively large amount of water - rich material in the asteroid belt increases the probability of water delivery , although water delivery is more sensitive to the giant planet configuration than to the disk properties : despite the large median value , note that 2/4 ejs1 simulations formed earths with less than 1 part per thousand of water ( see table 2 ) .",

    "myr , the median @xmath16 is 0.003 and for @xmath125 100 myr , the median @xmath16 is 0.010 .",
    "we attribute this trend to the fact that the planetesimal population decays with time and our simulations have limited resolution .",
    "so for late giant impacts or scattering events among the embryos , there are fewer planetesimals around to re - damp the planets by dynamical friction if the planets form more slowly .",
    "this problem could be alleviated with simulations which continuously regenerate planetesimals from the debris of giant impacts ( e.g. , levison 2005 ) , because in that case the planetesimal population would be sustained for as long as the giant impacts occur .    for the remainder of our analysis",
    "we consider the giant planet configuration as the only variable .",
    "we therefore combine the cjs1 and cjs15 simulations into cjs , and the ejs1 and ejs15 cases into ejs .",
    "given that the failings of these simulations are generally the same ( see table 2 ) , we do not expect this to skew our results .    figure  [ fig : m - a ] shows the mass - semimajor axis distribution of all 40 of our simulations , grouped into categories with similar giant planet configurations .",
    "when compared with the solar system s terrestrial planets , it is immediately evident that all cases with circular or lower - eccentricity giant planets fail miserably at reproducing mars small size .",
    "indeed , for the cjs , cjsecc , jsres and jsresecc simulations , planets in mars vicinity are typically 0.5 - 1 @xmath23 .",
    "the radial distribution of massive planets is much broader in these cases than in the solar system , and earth - sized planets are commonly formed all the way out to 2 au .",
    "in contrast , the ejs and especially the eejs simulations did a much better job of reproducing mars small size .",
    "the ejs simulations have smaller mars analogs than the cjs and jsres cases but in most cases @xmath126 . in 5/12 eejs simulations the mars analog was between 0.06 and 0.2 @xmath23 , and in each of those 5 cases the last giant impact occurred before 10 myr .",
    "the radial mass distributions for the ejs and eejs simulations are peaked , as is the case for mvem .",
    "for the ejs simulations the peak is close to ( or perhaps slightly interior to ) 1 au , but for the eejs simulations the most massive planets tend to lie interior to 1 au and planets at 1 au are typically half an earth mass .",
    "this can be explained as a byproduct of the excitation of the planetesimals and embryos by the giant planets : planetesimals and embryos on eccentric orbits are most likely to collide close to perihelion , such that systems with eccentric giant planets tend to have the most massive planets closer to their stars than for systems with low - mass or low - eccentricity giant planets ( levison & agnor 2003 ) .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : m - a ] that simulations with circular or low - eccentricity giant planets ( cjs , cjsecc , jsres , jsresecc ) tend to strand massive embryos in the asteroid belt .",
    "these embryos are typically 0.05 - 0.2 @xmath23 and would certainly disrupt the observed asteroid distribution .",
    "in contrast , the ejs and eejs simulations leave fewer embryos in the asteroid belt , and those that are stranded are typically smaller .    a trend that is less evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : m - a ] is that the total terrestrial planet mass decreases with the giant planet eccentricity in almost all cases .",
    "the one exception to this rule is for the jsresecc simulations , which have roughly the same total planet mass as the jsres cases ; however , at the end of each jsresecc simulation @xmath127 , so the difference between the two giant planet configurations is actually fairly minor .",
    "the reason for the correlation between increased giant planet eccentricity and decreased total mass in terrestrial planets is simply that eccentric giant planets perturb terrestrial and asteroidal bodies more strongly and destroy a larger fraction of the disk via ejection and collisions with the sun than circular giant planets ( chambers & cassen 2002 ; levison & agnor 2003 ; raymond 2004 ; obrien 2006 ) .",
    "in addition , terrestrial planets ca nt form as close to eccentric giant planets as they can to circular giant planets ( raymond 2006 ) ; this may explain the reduced number of stranded asteroidal embryos for the ejs and eejs simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : amd - sc ] shows the radial mass concentration statistic @xmath9 as a function of the angular momentum deficit @xmath16 for the terrestrial planet system that formed in each simulation .",
    "these statistics are normalized with respect to the mvem values of 0.0018 and 89.9 .",
    "the systems that formed have a wide range in @xmath16 , from 0.5 to almost 20 times the mvem value .",
    "in contrast , systems are clumped in @xmath9 between 0.3 and 0.7 times the mvem value ; none has @xmath9 higher than 0.71  this is similar to the results of chambers ( 2001 ) .",
    "most systems have @xmath16 values somewhat larger than mvem , although a few cases have @xmath16 smaller than mvem ( see table 2 ) .",
    "table 4 lists the median @xmath16 and @xmath9 values for each giant planet configuration .",
    "the @xmath16 varies significantly for the different configurations , and is smallest for the jsresecc and cjsecc simulations .",
    "this is consistent with the results of obrien ( 2006 ) , who formed lower-@xmath16 systems for cases with moderately eccentric giant planets ( analogous to our ejs simulations ) .",
    "the most eccentric planets formed in the cjs and eejs simulations .",
    "the cjs systems were eccentric because the timescale for clearing out of the asteroid belt and late encounters with remnant embryos was relatively long such that few planetesimals remained for damping after late encounters , as discussed above .",
    "the eejs systems were eccentric mainly because of the excitation caused by the @xmath63 and @xmath62 resonances , as well as direct perturbations by the giant planets .",
    "however , our numerical resolution also played a significant role : the four eejs simulations with 1000 planetesimals ( eejs 1 - 4 ) had a median @xmath16 of 0.015 , but the four simulations with 2000 planetesimals and slightly less eccentric giant planets ( eejs 9 - 12 ) had a median @xmath16 of 0.0033 .",
    "note , however , that the eejs terrestrial planet systems with 2000 planetesimals and @xmath128 ( eejs 5 - 8 ) were even slightly more eccentric than the cases with 1000 planetesimals .",
    "this large variation in @xmath16 for the eejs cases is again linked to the presence or absence of damping at the time of the last encounters between embryos .",
    "indeed , the mean formation timescale for earth analogs again scales inversely with the @xmath16 : for eejs 1 - 4 , 5 - 8 , and 9 - 12 the median formation timescales for earth were 109 , 129 , and 55 myr .",
    "this continues an important trend that we see : longer formation timescales lead to higher @xmath16 because fewer planetesimals exist for dynamical friction at later times .",
    "this trend is caused in part by our numerical resolution ( 1000 - 2000 planetesimals instead of billions ) and in part because we do not account for impact debris .",
    "however , the planetesimal population certainly does contribute to decreasing eccentricities so we believe that this effect is real , although accounting for other factors should weaken the correlation .",

    "for all of these simulations , the earth generally formed on the correct timescale and the terrestrial planets were low - eccentricity and water - rich . however , not a single simulation from these four cases was able to reproduce mars small size , and most simulations stranded one or more large embryos in the asteroid belt",

    "( e.g. , eisner 2005 , millan - gabet 2007 ) . if the solar nebula had a large inner cavity then the inner boundary for the planetesimal disk could have been at roughly venus orbital distance such that the radial compression of mvem is a result of accretion in a radially compressed planetesimal disk .",
    "alternately , resonant sweeping or tidally - induced migration from interactions with the residual gas disk or perhaps collisional debris could compress the terrestrial planet system and increase the @xmath9 ( see thommes 2008 ) .",

    "these four cases assume that delayed , planetesimal scattering - driven migration spread out the giant planet system , and that the 2:1 resonance crossing of jupiter and saturn triggered the late heavy bombardment ( gomes 2005 ; see also strom 2005 ) . the other two giant planet configurations ",
    "ejs and eejs  have jupiter and saturn at their current semimajor axes , meaning that planetesimal - scattering driven migration is not permitted because this inevitably leads to spreading out of the giant planets orbits ( fernandez & ip 1984 ) .",
    "therefore , the ejs and eejs simulations assume that the nice model is incorrect and that the late heavy bombardment was caused by another mechanism .",
    "the only other currently - viable such mechanism is the `` planet v '' theory of chambers ( 2007 ) which invokes the formation and delayed instability of a fifth , sub - mars mass terrestrial planet at @xmath2 2 au .",
    "thus , for eejs and ejs simulations to be consistent with the solar system s observed history they must form a planet v with the right mass ( @xmath155 ) and in the right location ( @xmath156 au ) .",
    "our results clearly favor the eejs simulations over giant planet configurations that are consistent with the nice model , mainly because of the eejs simulations ability to form mars analogs .",
    "in addition , the constraints that were poorly reproduced by the eejs simulations were in some sense our weakest , because higher resolution simulations with more planetesimals tend to lower the @xmath16 , and alternate models exist for water delivery to earth ( e.g. , ikoma & genda 2006 ; muralidharan 2008 ) . moreover ,",

    ", what would be the source of the significant eccentricities of jupiter and saturn in the eejs configuration ?",
    "goldreich & sari ( 2003 ) proposed that eccentricities of jupiter - mass planets could be excited by lindblad resonances in gaseous protoplanetary disks , but with eccentricities limited by the width of the gap carved out of the disk by the planet .",

    "however , other studies have shown that eccentricity growth via planet - disk interactions can only occur for very massive , @xmath158 planets ( papaloizou 2001 ; kley & dirksen 2006 ) .",
    "thus , the origin of eejs - type configurations of jupiter and saturn remains controversial but certainly within the realm of current thinking .",
    "another study has shown that the eejs configuration may be advantageous for reproducing the inner solar system .",
    "thommes ( 2008 ) also took advantage of strong secular resonances to reproduce the terrestrial planets . in their model ,",
    "collisions between embryos were induced by the inward sweeping of the @xmath63 and @xmath62 , which occurred as the solar nebula dissipates and changes the gravitational potential ( heppenheimer 1980 ; ward 1981 ) .",
    "their source of damping is tidal interaction with the gas ( ward 1993 ; cresswell 2007 ) .",
    "they manage to reproduce several aspects of the terrestrial planets , including mars small size . however , we note that thommes ( 2008 ) assumed that the inner disk only contained embryos out to 3 au and no planetesimals .    given these successes , it is tempting to regard the eejs configuration as the true configuration of jupiter and saturn early in solar system history .",
    "eejs is indeed consistent with the inner solar system . in the eejs scenario , jupiter and saturn",
    "must have acquired eccentricities of @xmath157 at an early stage , within 1 myr or so after their formation .",

    "earth s water was delivered in part from hydrated asteroidal material , but mainly from adsorption of small silicate grains ( muralidharan 2008 ) , cometary impacts ( owen & bar - nun 1995 ) or oxidation of a h - rich primitive atmosphere ( ikoma & genda 2006 ) . the late heavy bombardment of the terrestrial planets can then be explained by the delayed destabilization of planet v ( chambers 2007 ) , analogs of which did indeed form in several eejs simulations .    the outer solar system provides a strong argument against the eejs configuration .",
    "the resonant structure of the kuiper belt requires outward migration of neptune ( malhotra 1993 , 1995 ; levison & morbidelli 2003 ) .",
    "it is thought that neptune migrated outward because of the back - reaction from the scattering of a many earth masses worth of remnant planetesimals . given that neptune can not easily eject these planetesimals ( e.g. , duncan 1987 ) , the scattering of these small bodies also causes uranus and saturn to migrate outward , and jupiter , which does eject most of the small bodies , to migrate inward ( fernandez & ip 1984 ; hahn & malhotra 1999 ) .",
    "this planetesimal scattering is thought to have started during planet formation and lasted for @xmath162 years , with more rapid migration corresponding to a shorter migration , a more massive planetesimal disk or closer proximity between neptune and the disk s inner edge ( gomes 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "excess depletion just exterior to strong resonances in the asteroid belt provides empirical corroboration of giant planet migration ( minton & malhotra 2009 ) , although the migration timescale can not be constrained .",
    "thus , the current orbits of jupiter and saturn are not thought to be their orbits at the time of formation , and it is their orbits at early times that affected terrestrial planet formation . in particular , jupiter and saturn",
    "must have formed in a more compact configuration , because scattering - induced migration always causes their orbits to diverge .",
    "is it possible to reconcile the ejs and eejs configurations with the outward migration of neptune that is required by current kuiper belt models ? if a small mars formed because of the @xmath62 resonance , then the @xmath62 must have been in roughly its current location during mars formation .",
    "hf / w isotopes suggest that mars formed much faster than earth , and did not undergo any giant impacts after 1 - 10 myr ( nimmo & kleine 2007 ) . in addition , the location of the @xmath62 is highly sensitive to jupiter and saturn s semimajor axes such that a more compact configuration places the @xmath62 in the asteroid belt , farther from mars and less likely to influence its growth ( see fig . 2 of minton & malhotra 2009 ) .",
    "migration of jupiter and saturn must therefore have been completely finished in a few myr at the latest to form a small mars .",
    "would such an early migration fit our current understanding ? at such early times there likely existed a population of embryos in the asteroid belt ( wetherill 1992 ) . if jupiter and saturn s migration occurred that early , then embryos would probably have smeared out the observed depletion of asteroids exterior to asteroid belt resonances ( minton & malhotra 2009 ) .",
    "in addition , this very rapid migration must also have taken place in the presence of some amount of residual disk gas , which would certainly have affected the scattering dynamics ( capobianco 2008 ) , and would likely have been far too efficient in trapping kuiper belt objects in resonances with neptune ( e.g. , mandell 2007 ) .",
    "this suggests that the eejs configuration is at best marginally consistent with the outward migration of neptune needed by models of the kuiper belt .",
    "neptune s migration would have to have occurred early and been very rapid .",
    "in addition , to remain consistent with the late heavy bombardment , a fifth terrestrial planet must have formed at @xmath2 2 au .",
    "( chambers 2007 ) .",
    "an alternate hypothesis for the evolution of the outer solar system suggests that there initially existed several additional ice giant planets ( chiang 2007 ) .",
    "could such a scenario be consistent with the eejs configuration ? in this model , instabilities among the ice giants would have led to the ejection of excess ice giants and dynamical friction could re - circularize the orbits of uranus and neptune ( ford & chiang 2007 ) . however , in order to avoid disrupting the eejs configuration by injecting planetesimals into the jupiter - saturn region , those planetesimals would need to have been dynamically ejected by the ice giants themselves , which is unlikely given their relatively small masses .",
    "in addition , a detailed simulation of this model suggests that a population of many ice giants would not eject each other but would simply spread out by interactions with the planetesimal disk ( levison & morbidelli 2007 ) .",
    "thus , we are left with the same issue , that the giant planets would have had to clear out the outer solar system in less than mars formation timescale of a few myr .",
    "this scenario therefore does not appear to be consistent with the eejs configuration .",
    "the oort cloud provides an additional argument against the eejs configuration .",
    "if the giant planets reached their current orbits very quickly ( as required by eejs ) , then the oort cloud had to form very quickly as well .",
    "to populate the inner and outer classical oort cloud , the current galactic environment ( or one moderately denser ) is required ( brasser 2006 ; kaib & quinn 2008 ) .",
    "however , to capture sedna ( brown 2004 ) , a significantly denser environment is needed .",
    "these two constraints are not at odds if the giant planets evolved on long timescales , because the galactic environment can change on a 10 - 100 myr timescale ( e.g. , lamers 2005 ) .",
    "however , if the giant planets finished migrating , and therefore finished clearing the planetesimal disk , within a few myr , then the solar system should have either an oort cloud _ or _ sedna , but not both .",
    "thus , we are left with a problem : the giant planet configuration which best reproduces the terrestrial planets ( eejs ) is at best marginally consistent with the current view of the outer solar system s evolution , and likely inconsistent . on the other hand , configurations that are based on current outer planet evolution models , in particular the nice model , can not form a small mars , an inescapable inner solar system constraint . given that we do not have a choice for the configuration of jupiter and saturn at early times that satisfies all of our constraints and is also consistent with the evolution of the outer solar system",

    "it is important to note that our simulations are missing several physical effects that could be important .",
    "these effects include collisional fragmentation ( alexander & agnor 1998 ) , dynamical effects of collisional debris ( levison 2005 ) , tidal damping and resonant sweeping from a residual amount of nebular gas ( kominami & ida 2002 ; nagasawa 2005 ; thommes 2008 ) .",
    "we do not think that including collisional fragmentation would affect our results for two reasons : 1 ) alexander & agnor ( 1998 ) saw little difference in their simulations when they included a simple fragmentation model , and 2 ) the velocities of embryo - embryo collisions were slow enough that the majority were accretionary rather than erosive ( agnor & asphaug 2004 ) .",
    "we also assumed that all embryo - planetesimal impacts were accretionary , although these do tend to occur at larger velocities than embryo - embryo impacts because of viscous stirring ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coll ] ) .",
    "melosh ( 1984 ) showed that it is difficult for km - sized impactors to accelerate material to speeds greater than one third of the impact speed .",
    "based on this , we can assume that planetesimal impacts at speeds of less than 3 times the escape speed @xmath66 are 100% accretionary ; 83% of the collisions in our simulations meet this criterion .",
    "furthermore , only for impacts with @xmath163 do small - body collisions actually become erosive ( okeefe & ahrens 1977 ; svetsov 2007 ) .",
    "only 2 out of 3400 collisions in our simulations had @xmath164 .",
    "thus , our assumption of perfect accretion for planetesimal - embryo impacts probably does not affect our results if planetesimals were indeed km - sized .",
    "the dynamical effects of collisional debris are certainly important , although their effects have barely been explored because of numerical limitations .",
    "a continuous source of small bodies after large impacts would likely reduce the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets and make it easy to reproduce the low @xmath16 of mvem ( levison 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , planetesimal - planetesimal collisions create collisional cascades that can grind planetesimals to dust , which can then be removed from the system ( e.g. , kenyon & bromley 2006 ) .",
    "however , interactions between the gas disk and small fragments at early times may accelerate embryo growth by stopping collisional cascades and allowing embryos to accrete small fragments ( kenyon & bromley 2009 ) .",
    "tidal damping from small amounts of remnant disk gas can help reduce the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets , as shown by kominami & ida ( 2002 , 2004 ) and agnor & ward ( 2002 ) .",
    "gaseous disks around other stars are thought to disperse in 5 myr or less ( haisch 2001 ; briceno 2001 ; pascucci 2006 ) .",
    "such lifetimes correspond to a decrease in gas density to a level of about 10% of the minimum - mass nebular density , while tidal damping can operate down to a level of @xmath165 to @xmath166 .",
    "nonetheless , for this to be important the gas density must be at least @xmath166 for the timescale of earth s accretion , 50 - 150 myr ( touboul 2007 ) . for a steady accretion model ,",
    "the gas density @xmath32 decreases relatively slowly with time @xmath167 , as @xmath168 ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) .",
    "thus , if the solar nebula evolved smoothly with a characteristic timescale of 1 myr , then its density would have decreased to 10% after 5 myr , but would still be @xmath165 after 100 myr .",
    "in such a scenario , tidal damping would indeed be an important effect on terrestrial accretion .",
    "however , the final phases of disk dissipation are thought to occur after a few myr ( haisch 2001 ) on a @xmath169 year timescale ( simon & prato 1995 ; wolk & walter 1996 ) and relatively violently , via photo - evaporation ( hollenbach 1994 ; johnstone 1998 ) or potentially the mri instability ( chiang & murray - clay 2008 ) .",
    "future , more sensitive observations that probe smaller gas densities in disks around young stars will shed light on this issue , but our interpretation of the current state of knowledge is that it is unlikely that tidal damping would dramatically change our results .",
    "indeed , we suspect that the most important source of damping during accretion is likely to be small bodies , i.e. , planetesimals and collisional debris",
    ".    secular resonance sweeping during the dispersal of the solar nebula could play an important role in terrestrial planet formation if jupiter and saturn s orbits have eccentricities of at least @xmath2 0.05 ( nagasawa 2005 ; thommes 2008 ) .",
    "however , if the giant planets orbits are less eccentric then secular resonances are too weak to have much effect on the outcome ( obrien 2007 ) .",
    "we note that the model of thommes ( 2008 ) invokes this resonant sweeping to induce collisions as well as to shepherd embryos from the asteroid belt inward .",
    "however , thommes assume that the entire inner disk is composed of embryos and do not include any planetesimals in their simulations . given the strength of aerodynamic gas drag on km - sized bodies ( adachi 1976 ) , planetesimals should also have been shepherded inward by the resonance ( e.g. , raymond 2006b ; mandell 2007 ) .",
    "indeed , the mass distribution in the area swept out by the secular resonances may have been drastically altered if the resonances were strong enough .",
    "we are currently exploring the consequences of this idea .",
    "we did not test an exhaustive number of configurations of jupiter and saturn .",
    "indeed , given the relative success of the eejs configurations , it would be interesting to explore the resonant behavior for other allowed configurations such as , for example , jupiter and saturn on their cjs orbits but with eccentricities of 0.1 .",
    "we plan to search the parameter space of giant planet configurations in future work , focusing on systems with strong mean motion and secular resonances in the inner solar system .",
    "the majority of this paper has dealt with the effects of the giant planet configuration on the accretion of the inner solar system .",
    "however , we note that the disk s surface density distribution could also play a strong role in the outcome ( raymond 2005 ) . indeed",
    ", we did see changes in the 8 simulations we performed with a flatter , @xmath119 surface density profile .",
    "we note that there exists an alternate model that attributes mars small mass with the solar nebula s density structure ( jin 2008 ) . in jin s model",
    "the disk is ionized only in certain regions , causing radial variations in the strength of the magneto - rotational instability and therefore in the disk viscosity ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) . at the interface between an outer low - viscosity and an inner high - viscosity regime a local dip in the surface density",
    "can be created .",
    "jin ( 2008 ) s model has this dip at about mars orbital distance .",
    "this dip is quite deep but very narrow , although it could have swept over a region of radial with @xmath21 au in the lifetime of the disk . when considering accretion in such a disk , it is important to note that the typical planetary feeding zone in our sample has a width of 2 - 3 au , much wider than the widest possible gap created in the disk of jin . indeed , preliminary simulations using jin s disk form mars analogs that are @xmath170 .",
    "our simulations are among the highest - resolution to date , but we are still resolution - limited . to accurately model mars growth we require that the embryo mass at mars orbital distance is smaller than mars itself , in our case by a factor of 3 - 6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] ) .",
    "this mass sets the inter - embryo spacing and we are subsequently limited by the number of particles we can integrate in a reasonable time ( of several months ) .",
    "given these restrictions , our simulations may not always adequately model dynamical friction , because the planetesimal - to - embryo mass ratio is relatively small ( @xmath2 10 at mars orbital distance ; smaller closer in and larger farther out ) .",
    "indeed , the eejs simulations with 2000 planetesimals yielded smaller eccentricities than those with 1000 planetesimals because we could resolve the damping at late times .",
    "our approach contrasts with that of chambers ( 2001 ) and obrien ( 2006 ) , who used fixed - mass embryos and therefore had fixed planetesimal - to - embryo mass ratios of 10 and 40 , respectively .",
    "the advantage of their approach is that dynamical friction is more consistently modeled , but the disadvantage is that the number of embryos is small and the embryo mass is large , about one mars mass . despite the limited resolution and the difficulty with dynamical friction , all of our constraints were met in some simulations , including cases with @xmath16 values lower than the mvem value .",
    "we therefore think that our approach is valid , and we anticipate that faster computers will certainly improve the outlook for understanding the origin of the inner solar system in the coming years .",
