    "the lightcurve of the spectacular superoutburst from sgr 1900 + 14 in august 27 , 1998 exhibited a stable pulsation with period 5.16s ( hurley 1999a , b , c ; murakami et al .",
    "1999 ; mazets et al . 1999 ; feroci et al .",
    "since the modulation frequency is in the range of the other three sgrs studied before , kouveliotou et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and hurley et al .",
    "( 1999a , b , c ) concluded that the observations provide strong support to the duncan & thompson ( 1992 ) ; thompson & duncan ( 1995,1996 ) magnetar model for sgrs .",
    "they claimed that the observed spindown rate of the pulse period , @xmath1ss@xmath2 , may be explained by emission of dipolar radiation from an ns endowed with a very strong magnetic field @xmath3 g , a characteristic magnetic field strength inferred also from the spin down of the pulse period @xmath4s of sgr 1806 - 20 ( kouveliotou et al . 1998 ) .    despite the rough agreement between the sgr1900 + 14 on august 27 , 1998 observations and",
    "the theoretical prediction of the magnetar picture , problems for this model came together with that apparent success . on the one hand",
    ", it is clear that there is an overall consistency between the observations and the magnetar model .",
    "however , it is also clear that the simple  giant dipole \" dynamics is not unique in explaining the spindown history of the objects , and in fact several problems with that picture are already present when dealing with ordinary , low - field pulsar cousins . among them",
    "we can quote the values of the few measured braking indexes ( which do require modifications from the canonical dipole spindown model ) and the mismatch between characteristic and dynamical - historical ages in the case of some psr - sn associations .",
    "actually , the presence of ordinary pulsars in the high-@xmath5 , high-@xmath6  magnetar \" region remains puzzling ( manchester 2000 ) , and an interpretation of the sgr - axps in terms of high ( but sub - schwinger ) fields is in principle possible ( allen & horvath 2000 ) . on the other hand , it seems that a single population can not account for both ordinary and magnetar objects ( regimbau & de freitas pacheco 2001 ) .",
    "the event grb980827 was also detected by bepposax ( feroci et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these observations led to the discovery of an extremely regular interpulse set in the x - ray data of grb980827 event from sgr 1900 + 14 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the interpulses appear separated in time @xmath7s in between , with no lag .",
    "this behavior , feroci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) advanced , is unexpected and quite difficult to explain in the magnetar framework .",
    "according to the magnetar model for sgrs , global seismic oscillations ( duncan 1998 ) , pure shear deformation - induced toroidal modes ( standardly labelled as @xmath8 ) with no radial components , i.e. , @xmath9 _ overtones _ , are expected to be produced in association with the onset of a new recurrence of a  soft \" @xmath10-ray repeater . according to duncan ( 1998 ) :  ... these toroidal modes are easy to excite via starquakes because the restoring force is determined uniquely by the weak coulomb forces of the crustal ions .",
    "however , _",
    "overtones _ are not allowed because that would require far too much energy so as to allow for the extremely short period ( @xmath11  ms , or _ lower _ ) ns oscillations to be excited \" .",
    "an energy that the crust cracking mechanism can not provide ( de freitas pacheco 1998 ) .",
    "in overall , the simplest and neatest interpretation of that observations is that the subpulses in the lightcurve ( power spectral density ) of the burst from grb980827 are _ overtones _ of the fundamental frequency @xmath12  hz ( feroci et al . 1999 ) .",
    "as shown below , we may be actually detecting the whole wd pulsation spectrum , up to 19 harmonics ( feroci et al .",
    "the importance of having a large part of the pulsational spectrum of the object can not be overstated .",
    "the main purpose of this letter is to address this issue .",
    "we show that a self - consistent interpretation for the fundamental mode of pulsation and the harmonics discovered by feroci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) could be constructed invoking the excitation of wd pulsational @xmath13 driven by tidal - heating ( pons et al .",
    "2002 ) plus the irradiation ( podsiadlowski 1991 ) triggered by supercritical accretion onto its orbital ns partner in an x - rays ultracompact ultra - relativistic binary ( see a more detailed discussion on this model in the accompanying paper by mosquera cuesta 2004a ) .",
    "the basis of the ultra - relativistic compact binary model for sgrs ( mosquera cuesta 2004a ) , is that during rather sparse catastrophic epochs ( @xmath14yr ) the wd starts to transfer mass onto a low - magnetized ( @xmath15 g ) rapidly rotating millisecond ( ms ) massive ns ( @xmath16 2m@xmath17 ) .",
    "this process develops via the formation of a thick dense massive accretion disk ( tdd ) very close to the innermost stable circular orbit around the ns .",
    "the disk becomes unstable due to gravitational runaway or jeans instability , partially slumps and inspirals onto the ns . the abrupt supercritical mass accretion onto the ns releases a quasi - thermal powerful @xmath10-ray burst ( grb ) , a fireball to say .",
    "a parcel of the accretion energy illuminates with hard radiation ( @xmath18 ) the wd , additionally perturbing its hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the wd absorbs this huge energy at its interior and atmosphere .",
    ", is comparable to the heat ( @xmath10-rays ) difussion time in the outer layers . ]",
    "this irradiation excites other @xmath19-modes of the wd oscillation spectrum , the _ overtones _ , since it already pulsates at its fundamental mode because of the tidal interaction of the binary ( see table i ) .",
    ".first few radial ( l=0 ) and nonradial ( l@xmath200 ) modes for a 1.05  m@xmath17 wd model ( temperature = 12000 k ) .",
    "columns 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 , represent the l - value , radial overtone value n , period ( s ) and frequency ( hz ) , as computed by montgomery & winget ( 1999).[tbl-1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     thus , the rate of variation of the viscously attenuated pulsation time , @xmath21  s , divided by the timescale @xmath22  yr needed to dissipate via _ wave - leakage _ for _ radial modes_-folding timescale @xmath23  yr , for nonadiabatic driving of the mode with energy @xmath24  erg . ]",
    "the absorbed energy @xmath25  erg , gives us the observed  mean \" spindown rate in sgr 1900 + 14 ( here we assume this the dominant source available to the wd )    ( ) = 1.6310 ^ -10 ^-1 .",
    "in our view this is the origin of those important time variations .",
    "discrepancies might be caused by the differences in the wd model used ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we stress that in a realistic star the overtone frequencies depend on the wd matter eos and the degree of core crystallization .",
    "changes in pulsation ( fundamental ) periods of @xmath26 a few percent are expected to occur once lattice crystallization onsets while the harmonics ( overtones ) remain almost unchanged ( montgomery & winget 1999 ) .      what about x - ray emission and pulsation in long - term quiescence , pre- and post - burst ?",
    "a number of viable processes may explain why sgrs glow in hard x - rays over some months before and after undergoing dramatic transients such as grb980827 in sgr 1900 + 14 , as well as the long - term quiescent emission : 1 ) changes in the gravitational potential at each orbital revolution ( podsiadlowski 1991,1995 ) , 2 ) crust cracking driven by the wd strong magnetic field ( analogously to the ns case , see de freitas pacheco 1998 ) , and 3 ) plate tectonics ( rothschild , marsden & lingenfelter 2001 ) induced by any or both the mechanisms just listed .    in this paper , as a first approach",
    ", we shall focus our discussion on this issue in the context of the scenario number 2 ) above .",
    "the remaining possibilities will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "this key property can be explained if we suppose that the quiescent soft x - rays luminosity @xmath27  erg  s@xmath2 ( kouveliotou et al . 1999 ) is powered by the release of wd crustal elastic energy , inasmuch as in the current picture of magnetars ( de freitas pacheco 1998 ) . in this case , we get    4r^2_wd r_wdl^sgrs_x    where @xmath28  yr is the system lifetime since its formation , @xmath29  g wd crustal magnetic field , as in the super magnetised wd : re j0317 - 853 , @xmath30 , p = 725  s ( wickramasinghe & ferrario 2000 ) , and @xmath31  g is the wd core magnetic field .",
    "this yields a wd crust thickness : @xmath32 70  km .",
    "the crust - cracking induces shear stresses which dissipate energy causing excitation of wd oscillation modes quite similiar to the ns case ( de freitas pacheco 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "erg  s@xmath2 to play some role in driving the x - rays emission and pulsation during these stages due to its irradiation onto the wd , although the tidal interaction must be the dominant source . ]",
    "we thus emphasize that the conclusion by mazets et al .",
    "( 1999 ) :  ... the processes accounting for emission of the narrow initial pulse and the long pulsating tail in both sgr 0526 - 66 and 1900 + 14 _ are separated in the source not only on time but in space ...  _ , is realized in the picture introduced here , i. e. , the ns releases the superoutburst while the wd the subsequent tail of pulsations via the mechanism invoked above .",
    "as a summary , the ns low magnetization in this model leads sgr1900 + 14 ( and perhaps all sgrs ) under the pulsar death line making it undetectable as a binary radio pulsar , a viewpoint confirmed by xilouris et al .",
    "overall , since several sgrs are enshrouded by intervening galactic dust and gaseous nebulae ( sne remnants : gaensler et al .",
    "2001 ) , optical observations of the suggested hot wd ( @xmath33  k ) may render a breakthrough .",
    "this fact makes it a systematic high resolution search for such optical ( or infra - red ) counterparts of sgrs a timely and promissing task . in this line",
    ", we remark that ackerlof et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have pursued optical follow - ups of sgrs over 10 outbursts : 8 events from sgr1900 + 14 and 2 events from sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "although a careful search for new or variable sources in the view field of those sgrs was performed , no optical counterparts were seen down to @xmath34 .",
    "thus the search for such sgrs counterparts remains , and perhaps vla , gemini or keck observations in the k - band could unravel them . on the other hand , it will be extremely relevant if the _ propeller model _ of marsden , rothschild & lingenfelter ( 2001 ) and alpar ( 1999 , 2000 ) could provide a clean explanation for the observed spectrum of pulsational modes .",
    "this may help to discriminate among the sgrs accretion models through future observations ."
