    "physical arguments suggest that 2d lattice models at continuous phase transitions have conformally invariant scaling limits that can be described by conformal field theories ( cfts ) .",
    "the 2d cfts are exactly solvable : they can be studied in terms of representations of the virasoro algebra .",
    "one can in particular obtain exact formulae for the ( conjectural ) scaling limits of correlations , partition functions , and critical exponents of a large family of 2d lattice models .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and the references in the latter .",
    "while cft has been tremendously successful and allowed for the derivation of deep and spectacular conjectures about lattice models , it usually lends itself only to a non - rigorous approach to statistical mechanics .",
    "indeed , one needs to assume that the fields of the models have conformally invariant scaling limits and that they can be described within the framework of certain quantum field theories . in the special case of the gaussian free field , the field can be studied rigorously and representations can be found in the continuum at the level of insertions @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to conformal invariance was introduced by schramm , with his discovery of the sle@xmath0 processes @xcite .",
    "the idea here is to consider random curves that arise in the lattice models and to describe their scaling limits using loewner s differential equation .",
    "this approach has been carried out rigorously for random curves in the following models : critical percolation @xcite , loop - erased random walk and uniform spanning trees @xcite , the fk - ising model @xcite , and the discrete gaussian free field @xcite . besides describing scaling limits of discrete interfaces ( and so scaling limits of many natural observables )",
    ", the sle process is amenable to calculations and sle techniques have been successfully applied to produce rigorous proofs of a number of the conjectures of cft .",
    "more systematic connections between sle and cft have been studied by a number of authors , with various degrees of rigor , see , e.g. , @xcite .    still , we are far from having a complete correspondence and , overall , it is fair to say that the application of cft to statistical mechanics remains somewhat mysterious from a mathematical perspective .",
    "one of the difficulties is to pass to the scaling limits : one has to identify fields on lattice level , and to assume ( or prove ) that they have conformally invariant scaling limits described by a local action .",
    "moreover , the fields do not always admit a probabilistic interpretation . a natural approach to improve",
    "the understanding is to try to find precursors of various cft objects on the lattice level , and to see what relations they satisfy .",
    "a number of two - dimensional lattice models are considered exactly solvable .",
    "typically , this means that relations such as the yang - baxter equations or discrete holomorphicity are present on the discrete level .",
    "this implies in particular that the partition function or the correlation functions of these models admit exact formulae .",
    "in fact , this is how most of the rigorous results about lattice models were derived in the 20th century .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "recent mathematical progress has allowed for rigorous proofs that a number of exactly solvable lattice models ( in the discrete sense ) have conformally invariant scaling limits , and to rigorously derive exact formulae for their correlation functions ( predicted by exactly solved cfts ) .",
    "the central tool to establish conformal invariance of these lattice models is their discrete holomorphicity relations , allowing for the use of discrete complex analysis techniques , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "once the ( lattice ) exact solvability has been used to prove conformal invariance in the limit , one can try to use conformal invariance to reveal the algebraic structure of the virasoro algebra , and in this way connect the lattice solvability with the cft solvability . for this",
    ", one can either connect the model with sle or the ( continuum ) gaussian free field and use the techniques described above , or try to find lattice precursors of cft objects @xcite .",
    "a natural question thus arises :    * is there a direct connection between the exact solvability on the discrete level and the one on the continuum level ?",
    "we will show that , surprisingly , the answer is positive in two natural cases . on the square lattice for the discrete gaussian free field ( discrete gff ) and the critical ising model ,",
    "the same algebraic structures that arise in the continuum as consequences of the conformal symmetry are already present on discrete level as consequences of discrete holomorphicity . in this paper",
    "we will give the proofs for the discrete gff and in a companion paper those for the ising model .",
    "this question has been investigated in the physics literature in the case of the 8-vertex model ( using the corner transfer matrix ) and the ising model , see @xcite and the references in the latter .",
    "however , our results are the first in which discrete holomorphicity is connected with the virasoro algebra and our approach gives the exact virasoro algebras ( and not deformations thereof ) with the right physical content , that is , the correct central charge",
    ". moreover , the action of the operators takes place on the level of gibbs measures , and this gives concrete insight into the role of cft for the description of probabilistic lattice models .",
    "our constructions can be modified to cover the case of the discrete gff in a half plane with dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "this corresponds to boundary cft ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) : besides the two commuting bulk representations , we recover in the vicinity of the boundary a representation of the virasoro algebra with correct central charge , `` mixing '' the analytic and antianalytic sectors .",
    "an advantage of considering lattice models before the scaling limit is that measure - theoretic questions become much easier to deal with .",
