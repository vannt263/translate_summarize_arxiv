    "in the context of extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , r - parity conserving minimal supersymmetric one ( mssm ) is the most studied scenario of physics beyond the sm [ 1 ] .",
    "therefore , searching for supersymmetric particles is going to be an important part of experimental programs of future colliders .",
    "meanwhile , because of the clearest signature , the associated production of the squarks and sleptons is the most important process in the search for susy in lepton - hadron collisions . in this paper",
    "we reanalyzed the associated squark and sneutrino production in lepton - hadron collisions [ 2 ] for linac@xmath3lhc and @xmath4p colliders with the center of mass energies @xmath5 tev and 3 tev , respectively [ 3 ] .",
    "we do not consider thera [ 4 ] and lep@xmath3 lhc [ 5 ] because of unsufficient center of mass energies @xmath6 .",
    "in lepton - proton interactions the r - parity conserving process @xmath7 proceeds via charged gaugino exchange in the t - channel of the subprocesses @xmath8 .the polarized subprocess cross sections can be written as follows :    @xmath9    @xmath10\\ ] ]    where @xmath11^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath12 is the center of mass energy of the incoming lepton and quark and @xmath13 is the weak coupling constant .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 denote masses of sneutrino , squark and chargino , respectively .    the mass matrix for charginos in the @xmath16 basis is given as    m@xmath17=@xmath18_w@xmath19m_w@xmath20m_w@xmath19@xmath21 $ ]    so that gauginos and higgsinos mix in general to form charginos @xmath22 because of broken susy .",
    "in sugra inspired models @xmath23 and @xmath4 is of order @xmath24 , therefore , the lighter chargino is going dominantly be gaugino . for numerical evaluations we use sugra point 6 spectrum from atlas tdr [ 6 ] .",
    "the reason we choose this point is the large value of @xmath25 , which is natural in mssm , because of the relation @xmath26 coming from flavor democracy hypothesis in three family case [ 7 ] . the mass spectrum of susy particles is presented in table i.    by folding subprocess cross - section @xmath27 over the quark distribution functions f@xmath28 ( in @xmath29 and @xmath30 cases sea - quark distributions should be used ) [ 8 ] , we obtain the total cross - section for the production of a particular sneutrino - squark pair in lepton - proton collision at the center of mass energy @xmath31 ;    @xmath32    where @xmath33 . in figure 1",
    "we plot the total cross - section versus center of mass energy of lepton - proton collisions using the mass values given in table i. numerical values of corresponding cross - sections and event numbers for linac@xmath3lhc and @xmath4p colliders are presented in table ii .",
    "the lines a , b , c and d correspond to the reactions @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively.,width=453 ]    for the signal we confine ourselves to the reaction @xmath38 only . according to the table i",
    ", decay modes of the scalar neutrino are @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "since r - parity is conserved the lightest neutralino , @xmath42 , is stable whereas @xmath42 and @xmath43 have the following leptonic and hadronic decays : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "main decay modes of down squark are : @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "subsequent decays of @xmath50 are going to be the charge conjugate of @xmath51 decays and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . taking into account that @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 we see that the process under consideration will give @xmath60 clear events of the type @xmath61@xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "similar estimations can be made for other processes in @xmath64 and @xmath65 collisions shown in the table ii .    as a second example let us consider the production of supersymmetric partner of right - handed neutrino .",
    "recent experimental results on neutrino oscillations force us to include the right - handed neutrinos into the sm , so to include the @xmath66 into the mssm . in this case",
    "the `` right '' sneutrino can be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) [ 7 ] . in general , superpartners of left and right - handed neutrinos mix to generate the mass eigenstates therefore one has to deal with a @xmath67 mass matrix for simplicity here we ignore the interfamily mixings and we are left    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "our estimations show that linac@xmath3lhc based ep collider has great potential in searching for supersymmetric particles . although @xmath65 collider has also considerable potential in searching for susy , because of its less luminosity it is not compatible with linac@xmath3lhc .    99 h.e .",
