    "wz sge - type dwarf novae are a class of su uma - type dwarf novae [ for recent summaries of dwarf novae and su uma - type dwarf novae , see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ] , characterized by a long ( @xmath0 10 yr ) outburst recurrence time and a large ( @xmath0 8 mag ) outburst amplitude ( cf .",

    "wz sge - type dwarf novae are considered to be systems close to the terminal evolution of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "since the expected mass of the mass - donor secondary stars in such systems is close to the lower limit of normal low - mass stars , wz sge - type dwarf novae are recently regarded as promising candidates for binaries containing brown dwarfs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ll and , being known as a hydrogen - rich dwarf nova with one of the shortest periods , has been nominated as a promising candidate harboring a brown dwarf secondary @xcite .",
    "ll and is an eruptive object discovered in 1979 @xcite .",
    "since the only approximate position was announced at the time of the discovery , we examined the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) i prints and identified a blue object close to the reported position ( t. kato , 1990 , unpublished ) .",
    "this supposed identification , which was later confirmed by the detection of a new outburst in 1993 , of a relatively bright ( @xmath0 19 mag ) quiescent counterpart naturally suggested the dwarf nova - type classification .",
    "this information was quickly relayed to observers through the international alert networks ( e.g. vsnet : @xcite ) , and the object has been continuously monitored since then .",
    "the long - awaited next outburst finally occurred in 1993 .",
    "the ccd photometric observation was performed using a ccd camera ( thomson th  7882 , 576 @xmath2 384 pixels , on - chip 2 @xmath2 2 binning adopted ) attached to the cassegrain focus of the 60-cm reflector ( focal length = 4.8 m ) at ouda station , kyoto university @xcite .",

    "the gsc magnitudes , which were used at the time of the 1993 outburst , are confirmed to be @xmath0 0.4 mag too bright , which explains the discrepancy between the present ccd @xmath4 measurements and the visual observations published on the 1993 outburst occasion @xcite .",
    "we thereby added a correction of 0.4 mag to the visual observations described in @xcite .",
    "we also obtained a few snapshot quiescent observations which are also listed in table [ tab : log ] .",
    "heliocentric corrections to the observed times were applied before the following period analysis .",

    "it was thus less likely that the object underwent a missed brighter maximum before vanmunster s initial detection . following a slow decline at least until december 15 ,",
    "the object entered the rapid decline stage sometime before december 19 .",
    "the most likely duration of the outburst was 9@xmath12 d.    ( 88mm,60mm)fig1.eps      on december 9 , 11 , and 12 , our time - resolved ccd photometry revealed the presence of superhumps .",
    "this information , relayed through the alert network system @xcite , was announced by @xcite .",
    "the nightly light curves of the superhumps are shown in figure [ fig : shlc ] .",
    "( 88mm,120mm)fig2.eps    after removing the trend of linear decline ( 0.64 mag d@xmath9 ) , the december 912 observations were analyzed using the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm : @xcite ) .",
    "the resultant period is 0.05697(3 ) d. the statistical significance of the period is better than 99.5% .",
    "the selection of the correct alias was confirmed by independent analyses of continuous nightly observations .",
    "the error of the period was estimated using the lafler ",
    "kinman class of methods , as applied by @xcite .",
    "this period supersedes the older preliminary values cited in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( 88mm,60mm)fig3.eps    figure [ fig : ph ] shows the phase - averaged superhump profile of ll and folded with the best period of 0.05697 d. although the profile is rather complex ( with a secondary maximum following the primary maximum ) , the overall appearance with a faster rise and and a slower decline is characteristic of su uma - type superhumps ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite suggested , from the available material at these times , that ll and belongs to a class of dwarf novae with large outburst amplitudes .",
    "this identification , however , becomes dubious upon closer examination of the present material .",
    "firstly , @xcite used the maximum outburst magnitude of @xmath10 = 13.8 , which is clearly an overestimated caused by an incorrect zero point .",
    "the present observation , calibrated on the modern @xmath4 scale , suggests a much fainter outburst maximum of @xmath4 = 14.314.5 .",
    "the bright magnitude quoted by @xcite needs to be treated with special caution , because the observation probably used blue - sensitive plates ( hence would not adequately represent visual magnitudes ) , and because the published magnitudes were very likely only preliminary measurements with probable errors of @xmath01 mag .",
    "secondly , the quiescent magnitude in @xcite , @xcite was likely underestimated .",
    "the object is already readily recognized on paper reproduction of poss i red and blue prints ( section [ sec : intro ] ) , which suggests a significantly brighter magnitude than @xmath11 20 .",
    "the modern magnitude estimates ( usno b1.0 : @xcite ) give red and blue magnitudes of 19.26 and 19.5919.78 , respectively .",
    "these measurements are in line with the author s estimate on poss i paper prints .",
    "the usno b1.0 magnitude correspond to @xmath4 = 19.4 .",
    "the outburst frequency looks like to be small .",
    "the only recorded outbursts up to now were in 1979 september @xcite and in 1993 december ( this work ) . in spite of intensive monitoring mainly by the vsnet @xcite members ,",
    "no definite outburst has been recorded up to 2003 . even considering the unavoidable seasonal observational gaps , the detected outbursts are much less frequent than in most dwarf novae , and may be comparable to those of the wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "very recently , @xcite reported the detection of photometric periodicity of 0.055053(6 ) d. assuming that this periodicity represents the orbital period ( @xmath12 ) , = 0.055053(6 ) d to likely represent @xmath12 because of its proximity to what would be expected from the superhump period using the known relation @xcite . ]",
    "the fractional superhump excess @xmath13 amounts to 3.5(1 ) % .",
    "this value is exceptionally large for an su uma - type system with @xmath14 = 0.05697 d ( cf .",
    "this conclusion seems to further support the presence of a rather massive secondary star @xcite , and is likely incompatible with the earlier claim of a brown - dwarf secondary @xcite .",
    "as shown in subsection [ sec : outprop ] , the outburst cycle length of ll and is likely comparable to rarely outbursting wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "the short superhump period ( 0.05697 d ) is also comparable to those of wz sge - type dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "the object , however , shows remarkable difference from typical wz sge - type dwarf novae in its small ( @xmath0 5 mag ) outburst amplitude ( compared to @xmath0 8 mag for wz sge - type dwarf novae ) , short ( 9@xmath12 d ) duration of the superoutburst ( compared to @xmath1520 d for wz sge - type dwarf novae , cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of long outburst cycle length , low outburst amplitude , and short duration of a superoutburst resembles that of an unusual su uma - type dwarf nova go com ( a. imada et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in go com",
    ", the small scale of the recorded outburst , in spite of the long preceding quiescence , is interpreted as the possible consequence of the extraction of disk mass ( e.g. via evaporation ) during quiescence ( a. imada et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this scenario was initially proposed by @xcite to explain the long outburst intervals in systems resembling wz sge - type stars , but now looks more applicable to systems such as go com and ll and [ see also discussions by @xcite ; @xcite on the difficulty of reproducing wz sge - like outbursts with a  leaky \" accretion disk , as in @xcite ] .    by adopting the large fractional superhump excess ( subsection [ sec : shexcess ] ) , the secondary star of ll and is likely slightly too massive for this period ( figure [ fig : excess ] ) .",
    "we know at least two well - established examples of such short - period dwarf novae with unusually massive or luminous secondaries ( ei psc : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and qz ser : @xcite ) . both objects",
    "have low outburst frequencies than would be expected from their binary parameters .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that ei psc may be the first identified object following the hypothetical evolutionary track @xcite containing an mass donor having an evolved core .",
    "ll and may be an object filling the evolutionary missing link between qz ser and ei psc ( see also figure 4 in @xcite ) , and finally to the double - degenerate am cvn stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "further spectroscopic determination of the orbital parameters is encouraged .",
