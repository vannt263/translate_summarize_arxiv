    "the problem of the existence and of the uniqueness of the solution of stochastic differential equations with reflecting boundary conditions has been tackled by many authors . for instance",
    "stroock and varadhan ( 1971 ) proved the existence of the weak solution in a smooth domain , while tanaka ( 1979 ) considered convex domains .",

    "more recently , the reflecting brownian motion has been analyzed , for instance , by bass and hsu ( 1990 ) . in the present manuscript",
    "we adopt a different approach with respect to the above mentioned papers .    in our work",
    "we consider diffusion processes @xmath0 in @xmath6 reflecting ( orthogonally ) on the surface of spheres of radius @xmath15 .",

    "the reflecting hyperbolic bessel process inside the hyperbolic @xmath57-dimensional sphere with radius @xmath35 and centre @xmath118 , is defined by @xmath259 in the previous definition we have used the hyperbolic counterpart of the circle inversion , that is @xmath260 where @xmath243 e @xmath261 are the hyperbolic distances from the origin of two points belonging to the same geodesic curve and @xmath35 represents the radius of a hyperbolic disc .      in order to prove the statement of this theorem , we can suitably adapt the proof of theorem [ teo : kerndenssde ] .",
    "it is not hard to verify that the reflecting condition for the kernel @xmath265 of @xmath266 is satisfied , that is @xmath267 and that for the probability density @xmath268 we have that @xmath269    since equation holds , we can apply the meyer - ito formula as in the proof of theorem [ itobessel ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath266 is solution for the following stochastic differential equation @xmath270d\\eta_d(s)+\\int_0^t\\frac{s^2}{\\eta_d^3(s)}{\\bf 1 } _ { [ s,\\infty)}(\\eta_d(s))ds - l_t(s)\\notag\\\\ & = \\int_0^t\\left\\{\\left[{\\bf 1 } _ { ( 0,s)}(\\eta_d(s))-\\frac{s^2}{\\eta_d^2(s)}{\\bf 1 } _ { [ s,\\infty)}(\\eta_d(s))\\right]\\frac{d-1}{2\\tanh \\eta_d(s)}+\\frac{s^2}{\\eta_d^3(s)}{\\bf 1 } _ { [ s,\\infty)}(\\eta_d(s))\\right\\}ds\\\\ & \\quad+\\int_0^t\\left[{\\bf 1 } _ { ( 0,s)}(\\eta_d(s))-\\frac{r^2}{\\eta_d^2(s)}{\\bf 1 } _ { [ s,\\infty)}(\\eta_d(s))\\right]dw(s)-l_t(s),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath271                the hyperbolic brownian motion is also analyzed in the unit - radius poincar disc @xmath284 which is an alternative euclidean model to the planar hyperbolic space . by using the following conformal cayley mapping @xmath285 it is possible to transform @xmath286 into the unit - radius disc @xmath5 . since @xmath287 the hyperbolic laplacian in polar coordinates becomes @xmath288 ( see comtet and monthus , 1996 or lao and orsingher , 2007 ) , and then the kernel of the hyperbolic brownian motion @xmath289 inside @xmath5 satisfies the following equation @xmath290 with initial condition @xmath291 . the stochastic differential equation solved by the process @xmath289 reads @xmath292 moreover between the hyperbolic distance in the poincar upper - half plane @xmath243 and",
    "@xmath293 the following relationship holds @xmath294 or equivalently @xmath295 we indicate the reflecting hyperbolic brownian motion inside a disc with radius @xmath40 by @xmath296 means of circular inversion .",
    "therefore , we have that @xmath297    by means of the same arguments exploited in the previous sections we can immediately obtain the results concerning the reflecting brownian motion in @xmath5 . for this reason , in what follows , we omit the details of the proofs .",
    "finally , by applying again the meyer - ito rule , we are able to prove that @xmath305dd(s)+\\int_0^t\\frac{v^2}{d^3(s)}{\\bf 1 } _ { [ v,1)}(d(s))ds - l_t(v)\\notag\\\\ & = \\int_0^t\\left\\{\\left[{\\bf 1 } _ { ( 0,v)}(d(s))-\\frac{v^2}{d^2(s)}{\\bf 1 } _ { [ v,1)}(d(s))\\right]\\frac{(1-d^2(s))^2}{4d(s)}+\\frac{v^2}{d^3(s)}{\\bf 1 } _ { [ v,1)}(d(s))\\right\\}ds\\\\ & \\quad+\\int_0^t\\left[{\\bf 1 } _ { ( 0,v)}(\\eta_d(s))-\\frac{v^2}{d^2(s)}{\\bf 1 } _ { [ v,1)}(d(s))\\right]\\frac{1-d^2(s)}{\\sqrt{2}}dw(s)-l_t(v).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]"
