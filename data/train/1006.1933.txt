    "the cosmic density and velocity fields of the intergalactic medium(igm ) at low redshifts are highly non - gaussian , while the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation basically are gaussian or at most weakly non - gaussian .",
    "thus , the non - gaussian features of the igm at low redshifts should mainly result from nonlinear dynamical processes .",
    "a well knowledge of these non - gaussian features and their development history can fundamentally improve our understanding of the formation and evolution of the structures in the universe .",
    "for instance , the lognormal clustering model of the igm ( bi , 1993 ; bi & devidson 1997 ; liu et al 2006 ; feng et al 2008 ) can explain well all the basic properties of the ly@xmath1 forests of quasar s absorption spectrum at various redshifts .",
    "however , high order statistics do reveal the deviation of observation from the lognormal model ( jamkhedkar et al .",
    "2003 ; lu et al 2009 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the non - gaussian features of ly@xmath1 transmission flux of quasar spectrum at high redshift .",
    "the non - gaussianities of high redshift ly@xmath1 transmission flux have been studied by various statistics , including the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the flux ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ; becker et al .",
    "2007 ) , the distribution of the size of dark gaps ( songaila & cowie 2002 ; fan et al 2006 ) , the largest peak width distribution ( gallerani et al 2007 ) and the distributions of the width of leaks ( liu et al 2007 ; feng et al 2008 ) .",
    "most of these statistics are designed based on the following observation facts : the high redshift quasar absorption spectra consist of complete absorption troughs separated by the spikes of transmitted flux .",
    "obviously , these statistics are not suitable for comparing the non - gaussian features at high redshift and low redshift , as the absorption spectra of low redshift quasars consist of ly@xmath1 forests and do not contain gunn - peterson troughs .",
    "our focus is on the log - poisson non - gaussianity , which are characterized by two dimensionless parameters that are available for both high and low redshift samples .",
    "therefore , it can be a useful tool to study the redshift evolution of non - gaussianity .",
    "more important , log - poisson hierarchy is directly related to the dynamics of cosmic baryon fluid . with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of the concordance @xmath2cdm model , it has been shown that , in the scale range from the onset of nonlinear evolution to the scale of dissipation , the velocity fields of cosmic baryon fluid at low redshift are extremely well described by the she - leveque s scaling formula ( he et al 2006 ) , which was inferred from the log - poisson hierarchical cascade ( dubrulle 1994 ; she & wamire 1995 ; benzi et al .",
    "the non - gaussian behavior of the mass density field of the baryon fluid also can be well described by log - poisson processes ( liu & fang 2008 ) .",
    "recently , high order statistics of observed high resolution and high s / n ly@xmath1 absorption spectra of quasars at redshift @xmath15 2 - 3 are found to be well consistent with the non - gaussian features predicted by the log - poisson hierarchy ( lu et al 2009 ) .",
    "it would be worth to study whether the scenario of self - similar log - poisson hierarchical cascade is still hold at high redshifts . whether the log - poisson non - gaussianity experience a strong evolution in the redshift range 5 - 6 ?",
    "can we explain the log - poisson non - gaussianity and its redshift dependence with the concordance @xmath2cdm model ?",
    "a possible application of the non - gaussianity of neutral hydrogen distribution is to constrain the fluctuations of hydrogen - ionizing radiation background field .",
    "considering the inhomogeneity of uv background might be a source of the non - gaussianity of ionized and neutral hydrogen , the non - gaussianity of ly@xmath1 transmitted flux would shed light on the evolution of uv background .",
    "the inhomogeneity of uv background at lower redshifts are negligible and a uniform ionizing background is an reasonable approximation .",
    "the situation becomes more complex and debatable when @xmath16 ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ; wyithe & loeb 2005 ; liu , et al . 2006 ; fan at al . 2006",
    "; liu et al . 2007 ; mesinger & furlanetto , 2009 ; furlanetto & mesinger 2009 ) . therefore , it is also worth to study the effect of non - uniform uv background on the log - poisson high order behavior at high redshifts .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 gives the theoretical background .",
    " 3 presents the log - poisson hierarchy of ly@xmath1 transmitted flux fluctuations of observed samples of high redshift quasar absorption spectra . in  4 , we describe the method used for producing simulation samples , and show the log - poisson non - gaussianity of the neutral hydrogen component of cosmic baryon fluid .",
    " 5 compares the log - poisson non - gaussianities of observed data with simulation samples of ly@xmath1 transmitted flux .",
    "the effect of non - uniform uv background on non - gaussianity is also studied in  5 .",
    "finally , conclusion and discussion are given in  6 .",
    "it has been recognized for a long time that the clustering process of cosmic matter probably is hierarchical ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "that is , the nonlinear dynamics of large scale structure formation can be characterized by the merging of holes from smaller to larger scales .",
    "an early model of hierarchical clustering assumes that the correlation functions of the density field satisfy a linked - pair relation , @xmath17 ( white , 1979 ) , where @xmath18 is the @xmath19th irreducible correlation function with variable @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , the cosmic mass density field and its mean .",
    "however , observation samples of transmitted flux of ly@xmath1 forest do not support the linked - pair relation if the coefficients @xmath23 are assumed to be constants ( e.g. feng et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the hierarchical merging has also been modeled by an additive cascade rule ( cole and kaiser , 1988 ) .",
    "the basic step of the cascade rule is to assume that the a cell of mass @xmath24 and spatial scale @xmath25 will evolve into two cells , 1 and 2 with mass @xmath26 and @xmath27 , on scale @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a gaussian random variable .",
    "however , central limit theorem shows that the field produced by an additive cascade process should be gaussian .",
    "it can not explain the non - gaussian features of ly@xmath1 transmitted flux ( pando et al .",
    "moreover , this cascade needs a  very small initial units  ( peacock , 1999 ) as the first generation halo of the hierarchy , of which the mass is non - zero .",
    "this  initial units  is not compatible with hydrodynamic equations with continuous variables .",
    "a proper model of the the hierarchical clustering should be randomly multiplicative , and infinitely divisible .",
    "for a randomly multiplicative cascade , the mass @xmath30 in a cell at step @xmath19 is related to step @xmath31 by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a random variable .",
    "non - gaussian features can be formed through randomly multiplicative cascade processes , even if the original field is gaussian .",
    "the infinite divisibility means that there is no finite  initial units  in the hierarchical merging .",
    "the  initial units  of the merging process can be infinitesimal .",
    "the log - poisson hierarchy has all these desired properties .",
    "more important , the log - poisson hierarchy actually was inferred from the invariance and symmetry of the navier - stokes equations and works well in explaining the high order behavior of fully developed turbulence ( dubrulle , 1994 ; she & waymire 1995 ; leveque & she 1997 ) .      to measure the non - gaussianity caused by log - poisson hierarchy",
    ", it is better to use the variable @xmath34 , @xmath35 , but not @xmath36 . for a statistically isotropic and homogeneous random field",
    ", one can just consider @xmath37 , as the distribution of positive and negative @xmath38 is statistically symmetric .",
    "the basic statistical quantity is the structure function defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the order of statistics , and the average @xmath41 is taken over the ensemble of density fields .",
    "the second - order structure function @xmath42 as a function of @xmath43 ( scale ) is actually the power spectrum of the mass density field ( fang & feng 2000 ) .    in scale - free range ,",
    "the structure function should be a function of power law of @xmath43 as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is referred to intermittent exponent . for a gaussian field , @xmath45 is a linear function of @xmath40 , but for a intermittent field , function @xmath45 is nonlinear .",
    "the log - poisson hierarchy assumes that , in the scale - free range , the variables @xmath38 on different scales @xmath43 are related to each other by a statistically hierarchical relation as ( dubrulle 1994 ; she & waymire 1995 ) @xmath46 the factor @xmath47 is a function of the ratio @xmath48 given by @xmath49 which describes how the fluctuation @xmath50 on the larger scale @xmath51 relates to fluctuations @xmath52 on the smaller scale @xmath53 . in eq.(4 ) , @xmath54 is a poisson random variable with the pdf @xmath55 the random variable @xmath54 can be considered as the steps of the evolution from @xmath50 to @xmath52 . to ensure the normalization @xmath56 , where the average @xmath57 is over @xmath54 , the mean @xmath58 of the poisson distribution is then @xmath59/(1-\\beta).\\ ] ] the log - poisson hierarchy contains both the spatial size and amplitude of the density fluctuations .",
    "this point is different from other hierarchical models , which consider only the size of hierarchical units .",
    "the log - poisson hierarchy given by eq.(3 ) depends only on the ratio @xmath48 , which is obviously scale invariant .",
    "the hierarchy is determined by two dimensionless positive parameters : @xmath3 and @xmath4 , describing , respectively , the intermittence and singularity of the random fields . equation ( 3 ) relates @xmath38 on different scales by multiplying a random factor @xmath60 , which generally yields a non - gaussian field even if the field originally is gaussian ( pando et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the cascade from scale @xmath51 to @xmath53 , and then to @xmath61 is identical to the cascade from @xmath51 to @xmath61 .",
    "it is because @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is again a poisson random variable with @xmath64/(1-\\beta)$ ] .",
    "the log - poisson hierarchy removes an arbitrariness in defining the steps of cascade from @xmath51 to @xmath53 or @xmath53 to @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the log - poisson hierarchy , suggested by eq.(3 ) , is discrete in terms of the discrete random number @xmath54 .",
    "however , the scale @xmath43 is infinitely divisible .",
    "namely , there is no lower limit on the difference @xmath65 .",
    "it can be infinitesimal , and the hierarchical process is of infinite divisibility . with the log - poisson model eqs.(3)-(6 ) , one can show that the intermittent exponent @xmath45 is given by ( liu & fang 2008 ) @xmath66.\\ ] ] this is actually the sl scaling formula ( she & leveque 1994 ) .    from eq.(7 ) , the power spectrum @xmath67 is flat , or called white .",
    "however , the power spectrum of the initial gaussian field of the cosmic matter generally is not white , but colored with power - law @xmath68 . in this case",
    ", we should adjust the log - poisson hierarchy eq.(3 ) by replacing @xmath50 and @xmath52 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",

    "the non - gaussian features of the field described by the log - poisson hierarchical clustering have been given in liu & fang ( 2008 ) and lu et al ( 2009 ) .",
    "observational data used here consists of the spectra of 19 qsos with redshifts from @xmath735.74 to 6.42 that compiled in fan et al .",
    "the data have resolution of @xmath74 and are re - binned to a resolution @xmath75 . the observed flux , @xmath76 , is normalized with a power - law continuum @xmath77 .",
    "the noise and continuum uncertainty of transmitted flux @xmath78 is in the level of @xmath79 in the range @xmath80 , and @xmath81 in the range @xmath82 ( liu et al .",
    "2007 ) . for more details",
    ", we refer to fan et al .",
    "wavelength of the data covers roughly the rest - frame wavelength from 900 to 1350 . to avoid the mixing of ly@xmath3 absorption and the proximity effect ,",
    "only pixels have the rest frame wavelength @xmath83   and below the maximum ly@xmath1 are used .    in our analysis",
    "below , we use only the ly@xmath1 transmitted flux in the redshift range from 4.7 to 6.3 .",
    "there actually are 12 quasars available in the range @xmath84 and reduce further to 4 in @xmath85 .",
    "we divide the redshift range from 4.9 to 6.3 into 7 bins by @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "more specifically , the redshift size of each bin is @xmath88 . as a comparison",
    ", we also use sample in the redshift range from 4.7 to 6.2 , and divide it into 10 bins by @xmath89 where @xmath90 ; each bin has a size of @xmath91 .",
    "all the transmission flux pixels in a given redshift bin form an ensemble .",
    "the numbers of pixels in different ensemble are not uniform .    in order to compare with observation at moderate redshift",
    "we also analyze the high resolution and high signal to noise ratio ly@xmath1 absorption spectra of 28 keck high resolution ( hires ) qso ( kirkman & tytler 1997 ) .",
    "it is the same as that used in lu et al ( 2009 ) .",
    "the details of the data set and its reduction have been described in jamkhedkar et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) .    with these samples",
    "we calculate the optical depth @xmath92 , and the fluctuation of the optical depth @xmath93 , where the spatial coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath43 are in physical scale .",
    "since the variable @xmath94 is given by difference between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath94 is independent of fluctuations of @xmath96 on scales larger than @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the variable @xmath94 actually is insensitive to the continuum used in the data reduction ( jamkhedkar et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "as has been shown in lu et al ( 2009 ) , the variable @xmath94 is approximately a measurement of the density fluctuation @xmath97 .",
    "we can then study the log - poisson non - gaussianity with variable @xmath94 .",
    "for instance , the structure function with the variable @xmath94 is defined now by @xmath98    to treat the unwanted data , including low s / n and bad pixels , we use the algorithm of wavelet denoising by threshold ( donoho 1995 , jamkhedkar , et .",
    "al . 2003 ) .",
    "this method is effective for pixelated data .",
    "first , we calculate the wavelet scaling function coefficients ( sfcs ) of both transmission flux field @xmath99 and noise field @xmath100 with @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the scaling function of wavelet on scale @xmath103 and at position @xmath104 .",
    "we then identify unwanted mode @xmath105 by using the threshold condition @xmath106 this condition flags all modes with s / n less than @xmath107 .",
    "we skip all the flagged modes when doing statistics . to reduce the boundary effect of unwanted chunks , we also flag two models around an unwanted model .",
    "with this method , no rejoining and smoothing of the data are needed . the threshold @xmath107 is given by the same way as jamkhedkar et al ( 2003 ) and lu et al ( 2009 ) .",
    "a typical statistical quantity of log - poisson non - gaussianity is @xmath108 we test the effect of noise on @xmath109 .",
    "we calculate @xmath110 for data sets given by different threshold @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath107-dependence of @xmath110 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "for the data set at @xmath111 , the values of @xmath110 are @xmath107-independent when @xmath112 .",
    "in other words , the statistical results are stable with respect to threshold @xmath113 .",
    "we will use only data with s / n larger than 2 .",
    "this threshold is larger than the error level given by fan et al ( 2006 ) . for sample",
    "set of @xmath114 ( right panel of figure 1 ) , @xmath115 are very weakly dependent on @xmath116 .",
    "it is because , in the redshift range @xmath117 , the high order statistics @xmath115 are dominated by modes with high @xmath94 , and therefore , it is insensitive to dropping modes with low @xmath94 .",
    "however , the fewer the modes , the larger the variance of poisson process .",
    "therefore , we should consider the variance of poisson process in our statistics .",
    "we first study the @xmath3-hierarchy predicted by the log - poisson hierarchy .",
    "it reads ( liu & fang , 2008 ) @xmath118 eq.(13 ) requires that for _ all _ @xmath43 and @xmath40 , @xmath119 $ ] vs. @xmath120 $ ] should be on a straight line with slope @xmath3 . which is called @xmath3-hierarchy .",

    "figure 2 presents the @xmath3-hierarchy of observed transmitted flux in 4 redshift ranges @xmath121 , 5.4 , 5.8 and 6.2 . the statistical quantity @xmath122 are given by all available observed data , of which the physical scale @xmath43 covers the range from @xmath123 0.1 to 1.5 h@xmath9 mpc , and the order parameter @xmath40 increases from 1 to 2.5 .",
    "all the distributions of @xmath124 vs. @xmath125 in figure 2 can be well fitted with a straight line .",
    "it shows that the ly@xmath1 transmitted flux of real observation at high redshifts still satisfy the @xmath3-hierarchy and indicates that the log - poisson non - gaussian features are significant in the considered redshift range .    from the @xmath3-hierarchy straight line ,",
    "we calculate the parameter @xmath3 in redshift ranges from @xmath121 to 6.2 .",
    "figure 3(a ) presents the mean of @xmath3 in each redshift bin .",
    "the error bars are given by the variance of poisson process , which generally are large than the variance of @xmath3 in the given redshift bin .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows that the redshift evolution of @xmath3 is rather weak in the range from @xmath126 to 6 .",
    "we also calculate the redshift - dependence of @xmath3 with the same data , but the size of redshift bin is taken to be @xmath127 .",
    "the result is also plotted in figure 3(a ) , which shows the same redshift dependence as that of @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , the weak redshift - evolution of parameter @xmath3 does not affected by @xmath129 . from now on",
    ", we will only give results with @xmath88 .    figure 3(b )",
    "plots the redshift dependence of @xmath3 for the keck hires quasars spectra sample .",
    "the error bars are given by the maximum and minimum in each redshift interval .",
    "comparing figure 3(a ) and ( b ) , we can conclude that the non - gaussian parameter @xmath3 evolves weakly from redshift 2 to 6 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the physical scale @xmath43 in figure 3(a ) ( high redshift sample ) is actually smaller than that of figure 3(b ) ( low redshift sample ) .",
    "figure 3 reveals that the @xmath3 non - gaussianity on a small scale at high redshift are about equal to that on a large scale at low redshift .",
    "this result indicates that the turbulence state on scales 0.1 - 1 h@xmath9mpc at redshift @xmath12 would be the same as that on scales 1 - 10 h@xmath9mpc at redshift @xmath130 .",
    "this is consist with the fact that the jeans length at @xmath12 is less than 0.1 h@xmath9mpc and increases to @xmath131 h@xmath9mpc at @xmath132 .",
    "quasar s ly@xmath1 absorption spectra at high redshift @xmath133 are significantly different from that at low redshift @xmath134 .",
    "the latter show ly@xmath1 forests , while the former consist of complete absorption troughs ( gunn - peterson troughs ) separated by tiny transparent regions .",
    "in other words , ly@xmath1 transmitted flux experience a strong evolution with redshift rising from @xmath135 to @xmath7 . the low - order statistics of the ly@xmath1 transmitted flux , such as the mean optical depth and its variance , also show strong redshift evolution .",
    "therefore , the weak redshift - evolution of @xmath3 is very interesting .",
    "it implies that the @xmath3 non - gaussian feature is mainly dependent on the nonlinear state of the fluid , but weakly dependent on the optical depth and its variance .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath4-related non - gaussianity , which is given by ( liu & fang 2008 ) @xmath136 and @xmath137 it requires that for a given @xmath40 , the relation of @xmath138 and @xmath139 has to be a straight line with slope @xmath140 .",

    "<S> more interesting , the intermittency of quasar s absorption spectra on physical scales @xmath8 h@xmath9mpc in redshift @xmath7 are found to be about the same as that on physical scales @xmath10 h@xmath9mpc at redshifts @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> considering the jeans length is less than 0.1 h@xmath9mpc at @xmath12 , and @xmath13 h@xmath9mpc at @xmath14 , these results imply that the nonlinear evolution in high and low redshifts will lead the cosmic baryon fluid to a state similar to fully developed turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the log - poisson high order behavior of current high redshift data of quasar s spectrum can be explained by uniform uv background in the redshift range considered . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the log - poisson non - gaussianity by considering inhomogeneous background . with several simplified models of inhomogeneous background </S>",
