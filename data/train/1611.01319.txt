    "over the last two decades , the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , in which an initially absorbing medium for a weak probe field becomes nearly transparent in the presence of a strong control field , has been extensively studied in 3-level configurations ",
    "lambda ( @xmath0 ) , vee ( v ) , and ladder ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "there are parallel developments to demonstrate rydberg eit by using the excited level as rydberg state in ladder scheme .",
    "these studies have been utilized for the measurement of fine and hyperfine splitting of rydberg states in rubidium @xcite , electro - optic control of atom - light interactions @xcite , determination of atom - wall - induced light shifts @xcite , and microwave dressing of rydberg states @xcite .",
    "the presence of additional energy levels and laser fields from the usual 3-level eit systems leads to the modification of transparency window and allows the possibility of electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia)a phenomenon in which a transparent medium shows enhanced absorption at line center .",
    "eia has been studied  both theoretically as well as experimentally  mainly in 4-level n - type ( @xmath0+v ) systems @xcite .",
    "recently , our group has theoretically shown that eia resonances are also possible in a new kind of 4-level system in vee+ladder configuration ( v+@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "we extended this study to investigate the wavelength mismatch effect in eia and reported that eia resonances can be studied using a rydberg state excited with diode lasers @xcite .",
    "just like the imaginary part of the induced coherence on the probe transition can lead to anomalous absorption , the real part can lead to anomalous dispersion .",
    "this can be used for applications such as sub- and super - luminal light propagation @xcite .",
    "enhanced transmission leads to sub - luminal propagation ; therefore an eit medium can only be used for this .",
    "on the other hand , enhanced absorption results in super - luminal propagation , and the presence of four levels in an eia configuration allows for switching between enhanced transmission and enhanced absorption by varying the strengths of the two control fields .",
    "therefore , an eia medium can be switched between sub- and super - luminal propagation .",
    "this kind of switching between the two has also been studied ( theoretically ) in n - type systems @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present for the first time details of sub- and super - luminal light propagation in a 4-level system _ comprising a rydberg state for the uppermost level_. rydberg states are important for applications in quantum - information processing , but a scheme involving rydberg states is not possible in the widely studied n - type systems .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to our work in ref .",
    "@xcite where we study only rydberg eia , we concentrate here on the dispersion curve ( its slope ) and refractive index of the medium .",
    "we also present the transient response of our system , which shows that the medium can be used for absorptive optical switching .",
    "the 4-level vee+ladder system is shown in fig .  [ model ] .",
    "the ground state @xmath2 is coupled with state @xmath3 with a weak probe field .",
    "a strong control field is applied between levels @xmath3 and @xmath4 which allows the formation of ladder system .",
    "the vee configuration is formed by coupling levels @xmath2 and @xmath5 with a strong switching field .",
    "the detunings of respective fields are defined as @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and their rabi frequencies and wavelengths are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .        for specificity , we have considered the energy levels of rubidium atom  level @xmath2 is the @xmath11 ground state ; levels @xmath3 and @xmath5 are @xmath12 and @xmath13 excited states ; and level @xmath4 is the @xmath14 rydberg state . in this case , the wavelengths of applied fields are : @xmath15 nm , @xmath16 nm and @xmath17 nm . also , the decay rates of these states are : @xmath18 , @xmath19 mhz , @xmath20 mhz and @xmath21 mhz . since the probe field is weak , it ensures that levels @xmath3 and @xmath4 are always unpopulated and population cycles between levels @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "this level scheme has been utilized for the realization of eia using a rydberg state @xcite .    using the density matrix formalism , the optical bloch equations  by incorporating the decay of atoms from each level and repopulation from excited levels  for the populations",
    "are written by @xmath22 and the equations for the coherences can be written as follows @xmath23 the @xmath24 s are defined as @xmath25    the steady state solution of coupled density matrix - equations for @xmath26 under weak probe conditions is given as @xmath27 where @xmath28^{-1 } \\,\\\\          & \\beta=1+\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\omega_{s}^2}{4\\gamma_{eg}\\gamma_{es}}+\\frac{\\omega_{c}^2}{4\\gamma_{eg}\\gamma_{rg } }              -\\frac{\\omega_{s}^2 \\ , \\omega_{c}^2}{16\\gamma_{eg}\\gamma_{rs}\\alpha}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{es}}+\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{rg}}\\right]^2 } \\,\\\\           & \\alpha=\\displaystyle{1+\\frac{\\omega_{s}^2}{4\\gamma_{rg}\\gamma_{rs}}+\\frac{\\omega_{c}^2}{4\\gamma_{es}\\gamma_{rs } } } \\,\\\\",

    "the dispersion ( @xmath29 ) and absorption ( @xmath30 ) of probe field is proportional to real and imaginary parts of @xmath26 , and are given by @xcite @xmath31      the group index of the probe field can be evaluated in terms of susceptibility ( @xmath32 ) through the relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 and corresponding group velocity is @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the velocity of light in vacuum , @xmath37 is probe frequency , @xmath38 is the atom number density in the medium , and @xmath39 is the magnitude of dipole matrix element between levels @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the above equation shows that @xmath40 is inversely proportional to the slope of dispersion curve .",
    "large group index ( @xmath41 ) due to steep positive dispersion leads to sub - luminal ( @xmath42 ) propagation . on the other hand ,",
    "small ( @xmath43 ) or negative group index due to negative dispersion shows super - luminal ( @xmath44 ) propagation .      for an atomic vapor at room temperature",
    ", we have to account for thermal velocity distribution by carrying out doppler averaging , which is the typical condition used for an experimental realization .",
    "we consider an atom with velocity @xmath45 interacting with co - propagating probe and switching fields , and a counter - propagating control field @xcite . since the wavelengths of probe and control fields are mismatched , the two photon absorption for the ladder sub - system is non - doppler free , i.e.  @xmath46 , and probe absorption spreads over different velocity classes @xcite .",
    "we perform doppler averaging using the one - dimensional maxwell - boltzman velocity distribution . for an atom of mass @xmath47 at temperature @xmath48 ,",

    "on the other hand , dispersion profile for rydberg eia has negative slope at line center , which leads to super - luminal light propagation .",
    "these results shows that the slope of dispersion profile changes from positive to negative in the presence of switching field .",

    "the minimum value is slightly shifted due to mismatched wavelengths of the three fields .",
    "we now discuss the transient properties of 4-level vee+ladder scheme .",
    "the consideration of the transient behavior of an atomic system is important due to its potential applications such as absorptive optical switching @xcite , in which the transmission of a highly absorptive medium is controlled by an additional field .",

    "in summary , we have studied sub- and super - luminal light propagation using a rydberg state in 4-level vee+ladder rubidium system . we presented results for stationary and moving atoms at room temperature by performing doppler averaging .",
    "the dispersion profile for rydberg eit showed positive slope at line center , whereas it is negative for rydberg eia obtained when an additional control field is turned on .",
    "the variation of group index with control and switching rabi frequencies showed a _ valley of negative group index _ that indicates large super - luminality .",
    "therefore , an atomic system consisting of a rydberg state can be tuned from sub- to super - luminal propagation by applying an additional switching field .",
