    "nevertheless , decaying dm is an equally well - motivated scenario ; it arises in several consistent extensions beyond the standard model . among those candidates and frameworks ,",

    ", these models should induce a dm lifetime longer than the age of the universe .    for the case considered here ( see below ) , the total flux expected from decay , in a given direction @xmath1 ( galactic coordinates ) and integrated over the solid angle @xmath2 , is given by the product of a particle physics term with an astrophysical term @xmath3 @xmath4 depending on the decaying dm candidate",
    ", the photon spectrum @xmath5 can be a mono - energetic line ( from @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels ) , or a continuum ( e.g. , for some gravitino candidates above a few hundred gev @xcite ) .",
    "the mass of the candidate can span a large range depending on the model .",
    "for this reason , a signal is generally searched for in x - rays @xcite , or in @xmath8-rays @xcite . in the @xmath8-ray regime ,",
    "the most stringent limit on the dm lifetime ( that arises in the spectral term ) comes from the non - detection by the fermi - lat collaboration @xcite of emission from the directions of galaxy clusters @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on the astrophysical factor @xmath9 which is the integral of the dm density , @xmath10 , over line of sight @xmath11 and solid angle @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the integration angle .",
    "when d is computed over cosmological distances , the spatial term becomes coupled to the energy - dependent term as @xmath8-rays are absorbed along the line of sight ( @xmath14 attenuation factor , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . `",
    "cosmological ' @xmath8-rays will also be redshifted , affecting the spectrum . here however , our analysis relies on the mcxc catalogue of galaxy clusters @xcite , the redshift distribution of which peaks at @xmath15 ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) so that we can safely neglect the above processes .",
    "this allows us to factor out energy - dependent effects , i.e. the spectrum resulting from a prompt emission and also an inverse compton ( ic ) contribution from scattered dm - induced electrons and positrons .",
    "the benefit is twofolds : i ) it simplifies the discussion , and ii ) also avoids introducing strongly dm model - dependent factors .",
    "note however , that the respective ic contributions in the galaxy and in the clusters are probably different , and this should be kept in mind when comparing the galactic dm diffuse and galaxy cluster @xmath3-factors .",
    "as in the case of searches for annihilating dm , interesting targets include dwarf spheroidal galaxies , our own galaxy , and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently , diffuse @xmath8-ray emission @xcite and cross - constraints with other channels ( e.g. , anti - protons and positrons ) have also been considered @xcite .",
    "these studies rely on the analysis of single objects or small samples constituted by what are thought to be the best targets .",
    "as underlined in @xcite , one advantage of combining several galaxy clusters is that uncertainties ( for example on the total mass and dm concentration ) somewhat cancel out .    with this in mind",
    ", we show below how the astrophysical term @xmath3 can be increased by a stacking strategy of galaxy clusters without compromising sensitivity due to increasing the amount of background integrated . for that purpose ,",

    "contrary to the dm annihilation case , the extra - galactic dm decay contribution is a robust quantity depending mostly on the mean dm density of the universe @xmath25 . for the sake of simplicity",

    "the best observational strategy depends not only on the integrated signal and galactic halo plus extra - galactic dm background , but on the ( generally much higher ) level of charged particle and diffuse astrophysical gamma - ray backgrounds . in the background - limited regime",

    "would be moved towards smaller @xmath3 values and the benefit of the stacking approach could be greater .",
    "as well as ( close to uniform ) charged particle backgrounds and the diffuse galactic dm and astrophysical backgrounds ( see e.g. @xcite ) , non - dm gamma - ray emission from galaxy clusters must be considered as another possible source of background and/or confusion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "no individual galaxy cluster ",
    "but for virgo , for which a gamma - ray emission was detected positionally consistent with the centre of m87 by fermi - lat @xcite  has been detected in gamma - rays so far , but accelerated particles are expected to provide an additional gamma - ray signal in clusters . given the present situation of non - detection in the direction of individual massive halos ,",
    "a stacking analysis is advantageous to place limits on dm decay .",
    "any object for which a signal ( of suspected non - dm origin ) is observed can be discarded in the analysis at little cost for the exclusion limit . on the other hand ,",
    "if any signal is observed and is consistent with an astrophysical origin , stacking or merely looking at galaxy clusters will be extremely challenging for dm searches .",
    "alternatively , the strong scaling @xmath44 could be a good diagnostic to disentangle a decay from an astrophysical signal if the latter shows a different scaling ( maurin et al . ,",
    "submitted ) .",
    "the case of annihilating dm , which is found to be less favourable but more crucial physically ( limits of non - detection are close to the cross - section expected from that required to match the thermal relic abundance ) is discussed in nezri et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , focusing on the instrumental response of current and future observatories ( fermi and cta ) .    to ease further analysis based on our model , we provide with this paper a file containing all the necessary inputs for each cluster .",
    "an analysis on real data can certainly be optimised by adapting the integration region for each cluster . assuming all galaxy clusters share the same dm profile , and given the mass range spanned by the mcxc",
    ", we can make the first order approximation that their concentration parameters are the same .",
    "in other words , the concentration for an nfw profile is @xmath63 and we assume @xmath64 @xcite . defining @xmath65",
    "we find that there is a universal dependence of the fraction @xmath66 on the dm - decay signal .",
    "hence , given @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( available in the supplementary file , a sample of which being given in table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) , and a parametrisation of this universal dependence @xmath69 } \\text{~~~if $ x \\leq 5$,}\\\\         1   ~~~~~\\text{otherwise ; }      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] the term @xmath3 can be calculated for any integration angle , using @xmath70 this parametrisation describing the fraction of the signal in a given angular region is valid down to @xmath71 .",
    "we note that this function is unchanged if an einasto profile is used , but the d - values obtained from such a profile are larger than that calculated with an nfw dm distribution .",
    "the values for the ten brightest clusters are given in table  [ tab : tab1 ] , with values of @xmath3 provided for a @xmath57 integration angle ( see supplemental material [ 37 ] for the full list of clusters ) .",
    "we have repeated ( not shown ) the calculation for @xmath72 ( an angle for which most clusters fall below the galactic dm background ) to compare the @xmath3 factors with those of @xcite : our values for fornax , coma , awm7 and ngc4636 are found to be lower , but within a factor 2 of what was found in these previous works . in particular , the large difference for the fornax cluster explains why these authors have flagged it as being the best target for dm decay when it does not make it in our top - ten .",
    "this is understood as follows .",
    "decay is very sensitive to the mass estimate ( which goes directly as the integration of the density ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors use @xmath23 values from the hiflugcs catalogue that are larger than the ones provided in the mcxc catalogue ( e.g. , factor of @xmath375 , 2 , and 2 for fornax , coma , and amw7 respectively ) . for the former analyses , the authors used a @xmath73-model for the gas distribution , whereas the mcxc relies on the more accurate ab - model . as discussed in the app .",
    "a of @xcite , beta - models can produce factor 2 higher , or lower , values of m500 , depending on the core radii used .",
    "the masses for the mcxc sample could still suffer from systematics , as for instance from the use of the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis .",
    "however many comparisons to numerical simulations indicate that these uncertainties are @xmath74% . in any case , if the signal from the brightest source is overestimated ( resp .",
    "underestimated ) by a factor @xmath75 the improvement factor will increase ( resp .",
    "decrease ) roughly by the same amount . for the mcxc",
    ", we recall that @xmath23 and @xmath38 are obtained from the x - ray luminosity , making use of the @xmath76 scaling relation derived for the rexcess sample by @xcite . the mass estimate",
    "not only links to the @xmath77 measurement , but also to the intrinsic scatter about the scaling relation .",
    "further conversions to @xmath78 may amplify this dispersion effect .",
    "this stresses that caution is advised when working with individual clusters for which mass and radius are inferred from the x - ray luminosity . in that respect , stacking provides a more robust approach as it washes out those uncertainties .       to conclude , we have shown that a stacking approach can help to push down by a factor of 5 ( for the background - limited regime ) to 100 ( in the signal - limited case ) the current observational limits on decaying dm ( when using the mcxc meta - catalogue of galaxy clusters ) . a more thorough analysis ( e.g. , using deeper galaxy cluster catalogues and including absorption on the extragalactic background , uncertainties on dm profiles , etc . )",
