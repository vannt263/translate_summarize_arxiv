    "to observe gravitational waves , one needs very sensitive detectors due to to the tiny cross section of the waves with matter .",
    "there are several ground based detectors like virgo and ligo ( @xcite,@xcite ) which have a good chance of detecting gravitational waves in the next few years . for data analysis of such a signal ,",
    "if and when it is discovered , it is necessary to have a theoretical template of the signal that is expected from inspiralling binary sources . while it is not possible to get an exact analytic solution for such a system in all regimes of it evolution , we can use approximate methods to get highly accurate analytic results especially in the slow motion and wide separation phase .",
    "the hamiltonians for spinning and non spinning objects in the post newtonian approximation known to date are neatly listed in @xcite .",
    "these interactions have been derived using different formalisms , two of these being the adm ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) which compute the hamiltonians and nrgr ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) which obtain the result in the form of a lagrangian .",
    "+   + in this paper we extend the method introduced in @xcite to spinning sources , via effective field theory techniques using recent advances in s matrix calculations in particle physics .",
    "a similar approach was used in a recent paper to compute quantum gravity effects@xcite .",
    "we forego einsteins point of view of treating gravity as a manifestation of space - time geometry and instead treat all effects of gravity as the propagation of a massless spin 2 particle on a flat background .",
    "classical spinning objects are treated as local sources of gravitons and the modes which give rise to the classical potential between such objects are factorized from the radiative modes in an effective field theory(eft ) ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "for example , the technique of nrgr relies on explicit separation of scales relevant to the problem : the size of the objects @xmath4 , the size of the orbit r and natural radiation wavelength r / v . here",
    "the relative velocity v @xmath5 c. finite sized effects are treated by including new terms in the wordline action which are needed to regularize the theory .",
    "this usually involves terms obeying the correct symmetry constructed using the riemann tensor and the velocity v. the accuracy in the pn expansion can be improved by adding higher dimensional operators .",
    "the coefficients of these operators are obtained by matching onto the full underlying theory which is gr . while doing calculations in such an eft , feynman diagrams will show up at the tree and loop level as perturbative techniques to iteratively solve for the green s function of the full theory .",
    "+ modern methods of computation for scattering amplitudes have dramatically reduced the effort involved in calculating loop amplitudes .",
    "most of these involve the recursive use of on - shell amplitudes , which means that only the on - shell propagating modes of a field are used in any calculation .",
    "this technique automatically gets rid of the need for a gauge choice , thus eliminating the huge amount of redundancy involved in traditional feynman diagrams .",
    "+ the most useful of these for our purposes is the bcfw recursion relation@xcite and generalized unitarity methods(@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "these methods are traditionally applied for calculating on shell s matrix elements , but we are primarily interested in calculating the off shell potential between two spinning classical objects .",
    "the scattering amplitude is matched onto an effective theory in which the graviton is essentially integrated out .",
    "this leads to a well defined and ir finite classical potential .",
    "the calculated potential is a series in the relative velocity for a virialized orbit @xmath6 and the spin .",
    "both quantities count as 1pn in the post newtonian power counting parameter . +",
    "this method has been applied for non spinning objects in @xcite .",
    "we extend this to the case of a binary system with one spinning components and demonstrate the use of this technique for calculating the spin orbit hamiltonian to 2.5 pn order .",
    "we also present hamiltonians for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 terms at leading order for an arbitrary spinning object and show that a minimum coupling to gravity gives the interaction terms for a black hole .",
    "the kerr metric is then derived as a series in the pn power counting parameter by expanding out the action of a test particle moving around a spinning black hole .",
    "in the calculations that follow , we obtain spin dependent hamiltoninans from on - shell scattering amplitudes of a massive scalar particle with other massive particles with non - zero spin . from the addition rules of angular momentum ,",
    "it is clear that scattering of a scalar with a particle of spin j will generate terms of 2j , 2j-1, ... 0 power in spin when we match onto an effective theory .",
    "for example , the scattering with a spin 1/2 particle will produce terms which are spin independent and linear in spin . since we are interested in terms up to the @xmath7 order in the pn expansion , we need to go upto s=2 , to generate the @xmath2 piece . while its true that all the relevant pieces that we need can be obtained by considering only the scattering with a @xmath8 particle , in order to obtain terms that are higher order in g , it is computationally efficient to consider the scattering of the smallest spin particle that can give us the required result . to that end",
    "we first consider the scattering of the scalar with a massive spin 1/2 particle to generate the spin - orbit hamiltonian upto 2.5 pn order .",

    "<S> we utilize generalized unitarity and recursion relations combined with effective field theory(eft ) techniques to compute spin dependent interaction terms for inspiralling binary systems in the post newtonian(pn ) approximation . using these methods </S>",
    "<S> offers great computational advantage over traditional techniques involving feynman diagrams , especially at higher orders in the pn expansion . as a specific example </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a binary system with one of the stars having non zero spin and reproduce the spin - orbit interaction up to 2.5 pn order as also the leading order @xmath0(2pn ) hamiltonian for an arbitrary massive object . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the @xmath1(3.5pn ) spin hamiltonian for an arbitrary massive object , which was till now known only for a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we derive the missing @xmath2 hamiltonian at leading order(4pn ) for an arbitrary massive object and establish that a minimal coupling of a massive elementary particle to gravity leads to a black hole structure . finally , the kerr metric is obtained as a series in @xmath3 by comparing the action of a test particle in the vicinity of a spinning black hole to the derived potential . </S>"
