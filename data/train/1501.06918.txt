    "it is difficult to overestimate the relevance of the jeans instability in modern physical cosmology . in order to understand the emergence of cosmic structure , we need a mechanism that transforms the nearly homogeneous and isotropic early universe we infer from e.g. the cosmic microwave background observations , to the highly clumped one we can see today at the scale of galaxy clusters and below . in the standard cosmological scenario",
    "this transition is possible thanks to the instability of a scalar mode that appears when we couple dark matter ( dm ) to gravity , the _ gravitational jeans instability_.    in a universe dominated by a barotropic perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath0 , the behavior of the small perturbations in the energy density depends crucially on the speed of sound , @xmath1 , and the hubble radius , @xmath2 ( throughout this paper we use natural units such that @xmath3 ) .",
    "roughly speaking , we can distinguish three different regions in fourier space  @xcite : @xmath4  on scales smaller than the jeans length , @xmath5 , the contrast in the energy density oscillates with damping amplitude , due to the stabilizing effect of pressure and the expansion of the universe , respectively . here",
    "@xmath6 is the newton constant and @xmath7 is the background matter density .",
    "@xmath8  above this length scale but still below the hubble radius , self - gravity dominates and the contrast in the energy density grows : the jeans instability comes into play .",
    "@xmath9  finally , at scales larger than the hubble radius a relativistic understanding of the problem shows that the contrast in the energy density freezes .    perfect fluid structure formation then demands matter with a low speed of sound in order to have a window , @xmath10 , where the jeans mode is released and the perturbations can grow .",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) represents the simplest realization of this scenario , for which one assumes @xmath11 for all relevant modes .    for a canonical scalar field",
    "we have @xmath12 , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is usually argued that this implies that small perturbations in the energy density do not grow  @xcite .",
    "this would seem to be a very serious argument against the whole scalar field dm program  @xcite , so we find it mandatory to clarify the issue .",
    "in this paper we will consider the simplest situation : a universe dominated by a real massive scalar field @xmath13 satisfying the klein - gordon equation , @xmath14 . here",
    "the box is the dalembert operator in four spacetime dimensions , and @xmath15 is the mass of the scalar particle [ this corresponds to a scalar field potential of the form @xmath16 , so that the mass is defined as @xmath17 . the more interesting case with a complex field including the self - interactions and the presence of other matter components ( e.g. radiation , baryons , etc ) will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we will show that when the scalar field is slowly rolling down the potential , linear perturbations can not grow , in accordance with common wisdom .",
    "however , when the scalar field oscillates with high frequency @xmath18 around the minimum of the potential term , the jeans length is not given by the naive value @xmath19 one would guess from a perfect fluid analogy . instead it is determined by the compton wavelength of the scalar particle , @xmath20 , and the evolution of perturbations larger than this scale almost mimics that of the standard cdm scenario even though @xmath12 ( see figure  [ fourier ] for details ) .",
    "the main difference with respect to the standard cdm evolution ( apart from the appearance of a nonvanishing jeans length ) , is the presence of a time - dependent modulation of the different physical quantities .",
    "we will present below both an analytical argument based on expansions of the solution of the relevant cosmological equations , and results from simple numerical simulations .",
    "damped oscillations freeze down @xmath21 @xmath22 + @xmath23 @xmath24 + @xmath25 @xmath26    similar results have been presented before in the literature , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ( as far as we know the gravitational instability of a canonical scalar field in the context of a static universe was reported for the first time by khlopov , malomed and zeldovich in ref .",
    "however , to our knowledge , we present for the first time a description of the problem in terms of gauge - invariant fields .",
    "furthermore , note that our analysis does not rely on time averages and/or fluid identifications .",
    "instead we present a well - defined series expansion that makes it possible to find analytic solutions order by order in the expansion parameter : it is well known that the time average of the product of two functions is not in general the product of the time averages of those functions , and also that a scalar field is not a perfect fluid  @xcite , so one needs to take some care with the standard procedure . with this formalism",

    "one should also mention that recently the problem of structure formation with a massive scalar field has been studied by performing full nonlinear numerical simulations of the einstein - klein - gordon system , both in the relativistic  @xcite and the nonrelativistic  @xcite regimes",
    ". however , we believe that by studying the problem from the point of view of a mode analysis in perturbation theory one can more clearly separate the relevant physical mechanisms that come into play at different scales .",

    "finally , the bottom panel corresponds to a mode with @xmath178 , for which we have @xmath157 in the evolution . in this case",
    "the contrast in the energy density rapidly reaches a regime where it oscillates with constant amplitude .",
    "notice that in all these three scenarios the frequency of the oscillations increases as time goes by .",
    "this is again to be expected since the frequency should be constant in cosmological time @xmath32 , so that it increases in conformal time  @xmath29 .",
    "for a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath0 , there is a close relation between the hubble radius and the jeans length , @xmath179 .",
    "this is no longer true in the case of a canonical scalar field , where the characteristic jeans length is fixed instead by @xmath180 .",
    "when this length scale is much smaller than the hubble radius , perturbations can grow . for a perfect fluid this is possible only if @xmath181 . for a scalar field we have @xmath182 , but we could still satisfy @xmath183 . this is what happens , for instance , when the zero - mode of the scalar field is oscillating with high frequency ( when compared to the expansion rate of the universe ) around a minimum of the potential , where @xmath184 .",
    "note that this value for the jeans length at the scale of the compton wavelength of the scalar particle can not be resolved in terms of a nonrelativistic analysis , as it was previously done by hu _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "indeed , the value of the jeans length we identify in this paper does not coincide with the naive estimation they reported in eq .",
    "( 4 ) of that reference , and which has been frequently used after that ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for those modes larger than the jeans length",
    "the scalar field follows the evolution in the standard cdm scenario , except for the large oscillations of the contrast in the energy density for modes larger than the hubble radius when evaluated in e.g. the conformal - newtonian gauge .",
    "note however that these ( large ) oscillations are not present in the behavior of the newtonian potential , for which the scalar field behaves like cdm , or even in the super - hubble modes of the contrast to the energy density when evaluated in e.g. the synchronous gauge . as far as we know these oscillations of the contrast in the energy density for long wavelength modes in certain coordinate systems had not been previously reported in the literature , and it will be very interesting to explore if they are only a gauge artifact or if on the contrary they could have imprinted some signatures on the cosmological observables .",
    "we expect these oscillations will not affect the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "after all , the distribution of galaxies is only sensitive to the subhorizon modes , and these modes follow the standard cdm evolution .",
    "however , they could affect e.g. the cosmic microwave background photons at large angular scales , which traced super - hubble scales for a long period of time during the cosmological evolution .",
    "we leave a more detailed analysis of this point for a future work .    for those modes smaller than the jeans length the evolution can not bring the small perturbations in the early universe to the nonlinear regime , and the inhomogeneities are erased .",
    "this will introduce a cutoff in the mass power spectrum for the distribution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "something similar happens in warm dm scenarios  @xcite .",
    "if the mass of the scalar particle lies at the scale of 10@xmath185ev or above , as it is expected for the qcd axion  @xcite , the jeans length would be smaller than a centimeter , and the growth of cosmic structures would be probably indistinguishable to that in the standard cdm scenario , at least while in the linear regime ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the case when nonlinearities become important ) .",
    "however , if we consider ultralight scalar particles of masses as low as @xmath186ev  @xcite , the jeans length grows to the scale of parsecs .",
    "this could have observable physical consequences in cosmology  @xcite , alleviating , for instance , the missing satellite discrepancy  @xcite .    in order to determine properly the new expression for the mass power spectrum we would need a more elaborate analysis that includes , on the one hand , a knowledge of the initial conditions for the scalar field after inflation , as well as the evolution of the perturbations during the radiation dominated era .",
    "we leave this study for a future paper .",
    "_ note added._after the first version of this paper was submitted for publication we became aware of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the linearized einstein - klein - gordon system is considered in the context of cosmological reheating .",
