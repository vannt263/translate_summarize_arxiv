    "the @xmath0 meson system , which is a bound state that consists of a @xmath4 quark and a light antiquark , provides an ideal laboratory for precise study of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , and thus facilitates the search for new physics ( np ) . because the @xmath4 quark mass is much larger than the typical scale of the strong interaction , the otherwise troublesome long - distance strong interactions are generally less important and are under better control than in other lighter meson systems .",
    "radiative penguin decays of the @xmath0 meson with the emission of a photon ( @xmath5 ) and electroweak penguin decays with the emission of a lepton pair ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) are of particular interest in this respect .",
    "these processes reveal the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) , that is the transition of a @xmath4 quark with an electric charge of @xmath8 into an @xmath9 or a @xmath10 quark of the same charge . in the sm ,",
    "the fcnc occurs only via virtual loop diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] ) .",

    "examples of such np scenarios include those in which the sm particles in the loop diagram are replaced by hypothetical new particles at a high mass scale ; so far , they have not been directly accessible in collider experiments .",
    "radiative and electroweak penguin decays are highly sensitive to np because they are theoretically well - understood and have been extensively measured at the @xmath0 factories .",
    "the search for such np effects complements the search for new particles produced at collider experiments .    the first generation of the @xmath0 factories at kek ( the belle experiment at the kekb @xmath11 collider )  @xcite and at slac ( the babar experiment at the pep - ii @xmath11 collider )  @xcite have collected huge samples of @xmath0 meson decays and",
    "have thereby established the sm picture of @xmath12 violation and other flavor - changing processes in the quark sector .",
    "these processes are governed by a single @xmath13 unitarity matrix referred to as the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite .",
    "the ckm matrix can be illustrated by a unitarity triangle in the complex plane that is overconstrained by measurements from the @xmath0 factories , the tevatron @xmath0 physics programs ( namely the cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite experiments ) , and earlier kaon decay experiments .",
    "in other words , none of the current measurements of @xmath0 meson decays have observed any unambiguous sign of np  @xcite .",
    "although this experimental result is an impressive success of the ckm theory within the sm , there is still room for sizable new effects from new flavor structures , given that fcnc processes have been tested up to only the @xmath14 level .",
    "the nonexistence of large np effects in the fcnc processes hints at the famous flavor problem , namely why fcncs are suppressed .",
    "this problem must be solved in any viable np model .",
    "either the mass scale of the new degrees of freedom is very high or the new flavor - violating couplings are small for reasons that remain to be found .",
    "for example , assuming generic new flavor - violating couplings , the present data on @xmath15-@xmath16 mixing implies a very high np scale of order @xmath17@xmath18 tev depending on whether the new contributions enter at loop - level or at tree - level .",
    "in contrast , theoretical considerations on the higgs sector , which is responsible for the mass generation of the fundamental particles in the sm , call for np at order @xmath19 tev . as a consequence , any np below the @xmath19-tev scale must have a nongeneric flavor structure .",
    "the present measurements of @xmath0 decays , especially of fcnc processes , already significantly restrict the parameter space of np models . for further considerations on np ,",

    "quark - level fcnc processes such as @xmath1 , to which np may contribute , can not be directly measured because the strong interaction forms hadrons from the underlying quarks .",
    "instead , the experimentally measured and theoretically calculated process is a @xmath0 meson decay into a photon plus an inclusive hadronic final state @xmath20 , which includes all the hadron combinations that carry the strange quantum number @xmath21 of the @xmath9 quark . when charge conjugation is implied , or as @xmath22 and @xmath23 to reflect the quark charges of the underlying processes @xmath1 and @xmath24 , respectively , when @xmath12 and angular asymmetries are concerned . here",

    "expressions are constructed similarly for inclusive @xmath30 and @xmath31 final states , and isospin - averaged exclusive final states . in the literature ,",
    "the notation @xmath32 is also commonly used for the case that includes charge conjugation . ] exclusive final states with one or a few specific hadrons in the final state ( e.g. , @xmath33 ) have less predictive power theoretically ; however , because the measurements are easier and better defined , there are other useful observables beyond branching fractions , in particular @xmath12 , forward - backward , isospin , and polarization asymmetries . in the future , a large overconstrained set of measurements of these observables will allow us to detect specific patterns and to distinguish between various np scenarios .",
    "this review covers progress in radiative and electroweak decays in the past decade , during which a huge number of @xmath0 factory results were accumulated and significant progress in various theoretical aspects was achieved . the pioneering work that led to the first observation of the @xmath1 process by cleo  @xcite was discussed in an earlier volume of this journal  @xcite .",
    "our review is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : th - framework ] , we describe theoretical tools for radiative and electroweak penguin decays , and in section  [ sec : ex - techniques ] we describe experimental techniques .",

    "finally , we briefly discuss future prospects in section  [ sec : outlook ] .",
    "inclusive @xmath0 decays are theoretically clean because they are dominated by partonic ( perturbatively calculable ) contributions .",
    "nonperturbative corrections are in general rather small  @xcite .",
    "this result can be derived with the help of the heavy mass expansion ( hme ) of the inclusive decay rates in inverse powers of the @xmath4 quark mass .",
    "up - to - date predictions of exclusive @xmath0 decays are based on the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)-improved factorization ( qcdf ) and soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) methods . in general , exclusive modes have larger nonperturbative qcd corrections than do inclusive modes .",
    "rare @xmath0 decays are governed by an interplay between the weak and strong interactions .",
    "the qcd corrections that arise from hard gluon exchange bring in large logarithms of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 or @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 ) .",
    "these large logarithms are a natural feature in any process in which two different mass scales are present . to obtain a reasonable result",
    ", one must resum at least the leading - log ( ll ) series , @xmath39 , with the help of renormalization - group techniques . working to next - to - leading - log ( nll ) or next - to - next - to - leading - log ( nnll )",
    "precision means that one resums all the terms with @xmath40 or @xmath41 . a suitable framework in which to achieve the necessary resummations of the large logarithms",
    "is an effective low - energy theory with five quarks ; this framework is obtained by integrating out the heavy particles , which in the sm are the electroweak bosons and the top quark .",
    "this effective field theory approach serves as a theoretical framework for both inclusive and exclusive modes .",
    "the standard method of the operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite allows for a separation of the @xmath0 meson decay amplitude into two distinct parts : the long - distance contributions contained in the operator matrix elements and the short - distance physics described by the so - called wilson coefficients .",
    "the electroweak effective hamiltonian  @xcite can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the relevant operators and @xmath44 are the corresponding wilson coefficients .",
    "as the heavy fields are integrated out , the complete top and @xmath45 mass dependence is contained in the wilson coefficients .",
    "clearly , only within the observable @xmath46 does the scale dependence cancel out .",
    "@xmath47 denotes the fermi coupling constant .    from the @xmath48 independence of the effective hamiltonian",
    ", one can derive a renormalization group equation ( rge ) for the wilson coefficients @xmath49 : @xmath50 where the matrix @xmath5 is the anomalous dimension matrix of the operators @xmath51 , which describes the anomalous scaling of the operators with respect to the scaling at the classical level . at leading order ,",

    "the tilde indicates that the diagonalized anomalous dimension matrix is used .",
    "although the wilson coefficients @xmath56 enter both inclusive and exclusive processes and can be calculated with perturbative methods , the calculational approaches to the matrix elements of the operators differ between the two cases . within inclusive modes , one can use the quark - hadron duality to derive a well - defined hme of the decay rates in powers of @xmath57  @xcite . in particular , the decay width of the @xmath58 is well approximated by the partonic decay rate , which can be calculated in renormalization - group - improved perturbation theory  @xcite : @xmath59    in exclusive processes , however , one can not rely on quark - hadron duality , so one must estimate the matrix elements between meson states .",
    "a promising approach is the qcdf - method , which has been systematized for nonleptonic decays in the heavy quark limit  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a more general quantum field theoretical framework for qcdf , known as scet , has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "this method allows for a perturbative calculation of qcd corrections to nave factorization and is the basis for the up - to - date predictions for exclusive rare @xmath0 decays .",

    "therefore , large statistics and good particle identification are essential ; belle has the advantage in the former , whereas babar leads in the latter .    to gain statistics ,",
    "these three modes have been combined by assuming their nave quark contents , through the use of @xmath520 . in the latest measurements by both belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath518 mode was measured with more than @xmath521 significance and @xmath517 with more than @xmath522 significance , whereas @xmath519 remains unestablished with significance less than @xmath522 .",

    "the results are also in agreement with the more indirect determination by the unitarity triangle fit from other observables .",
    "this is a nontrivial test of the ckm scheme .",
    "however , although the experimental errors are still larger than the theoretical errors , the size of the theoretical error is unlikely to be reduced .",
    "a possible way to improve this situation utilizes the inclusive @xmath532 measurement with the sum - of - exclusive method .",

    "the ratio of the two inclusive branching fractions is @xmath544 which is converted to @xmath545 , where the theory error does not include the effect due to the limited mass range .",
    "this result is also in good agreement with other determinations .    the direct @xmath12 asymmetry for @xmath407 can be as large as @xmath546 in the sm , whereas the time - dependent @xmath12 asymmetry is doubly suppressed due to the photon helicity and the cancellation of the ckm element @xmath547",

    "however , nonzero negative isospin asymmetries in the small @xmath139-region of @xmath569 ( @xmath570 ) and @xmath451 ( @xmath571 ) have been reported by babar ( @xmath572 when combined ) .",
    "the corresponding isospin asymmetries by belle are @xmath573 and @xmath574 from zero , and are consistent with both babar s results and null asymmetry .",
    "the isospin asymmetry combined for @xmath555 and averaged by hfag is @xmath575 the sm prediction is essentially zero at this level of statistics ( see section  [ exclusivepenguins ] ) .",
    "muon to electron ratios in @xmath555 ( eq .  [ rk - def ] ) are also measured by both belle and babar .",
    "results are consistent with the sm , and their nave averages are @xmath576 and @xmath577 .",
    "the four - body decay configuration of @xmath578 allows extraction of further information from the angular distributions of the final - state particles .",
    "the most interesting observables are the fraction of longitudinal polarization @xmath460 from the kaon angular distribution ( eq .  [ kstarll - thetak ] ) and the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath579 from the lepton angular distribution ( eq .  [ kstarll - thetal ] ) .",
    "belle has measured @xmath580 and @xmath579 in six bins of @xmath139  @xcite , whereas babar has done so in two bins  @xcite .",
    "current statistics are not enough to tell whether there is a zero - crossing point at low @xmath139 , although the results favor the case with no crossing , for which the sign of the wilson coefficient @xmath387 is flipped .",
    "both results have positive @xmath579 for high @xmath139 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : both - afb ] ) , which sets nontrivial constraints on the wilson coefficients .",
    "cdf has also measured @xmath580 and @xmath579 in the same six bins as belle for @xmath581 events  @xcite .",
    "the results are in agreement with belle and babar .",

    "the @xmath20 system includes final states with one kaon and up to four ( two ) pions that have masses up to 2.0 ( 1.8 ) gev for the result by belle ( babar ) .",
    "belle recently announced a preliminary result based on 657 million @xmath321  @xcite , and babar s result is based on 89 million @xmath321  @xcite . in belle s new analysis ,",
    "partial branching fractions are measured in bins of the @xmath20 mass , and then the total branching fraction is calculated as their sum .",
    "this method reduces the large systematic error observed in previous studies that arose from the strong @xmath20 mass dependence of the efficiency and the unknown fractions of exclusive channels @xmath555 .",
    "the measurement is still dominated by the statistical error and will be more precise in the future .",
    "belle and babar reported branching fractions as @xmath582 and @xmath583 , respectively , which were averaged by hfag as @xmath584 integrated over the entire subset of phase space with @xmath585 , including the vetoed @xmath242 and @xmath563 regions .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the sm prediction .",
    "they strongly disfavor the case with the flipped sign of @xmath387  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the @xmath0 factories have measured all the observables within the radiative and electroweak penguin decays at values that are consistent with the sm predictions .",
    "these measurements rule out @xmath152 corrections to the sm and identify the ckm theory as the dominant effect for flavor violation as well as for @xmath12 violation .",
    "the success of the simple ckm theory of @xmath12 violation was honored with the nobel prize in physics in 2008 .",
    "theoretical tools and precision have significantly advanced during the past decade , and we are ready to challenge the sm if a clear deviation is found or to discriminate different np scenarios if direct evidence is found at the lhc .    also , the future offers great experimental opportunities in flavor physics .",
    "lhcb has finally started taking data and promises to overwhelm many @xmath0 factory results , and atlas and cms will also contribute to flavor physics . in the radiative and",
    "electroweak penguin decays , the most promising measurements are the angular analysis of @xmath581 and the analysis of time - dependent @xmath12 asymmetry in @xmath586 ; the latter measurement can not be performed at the @xmath0 factories due to the fast @xmath587 oscillation .",
    "however , the theoretically clean inclusive modes and many modes involving neutral particles like the @xmath339 can be pursued only at the @xmath11 @xmath0 factories .",
    "two proposed super-@xmath0 factories , belle ii at kek and superb in italy , would accumulate two - orders - of - magnitude - larger data samples .",
    "such data would push experimental precision to its limit .",
    "theoretical and experimental techniques are ready for such large data samples .",
    "the results provided by lhcb and the next - generation @xmath11 @xmath0 factories are eagerly awaited , as they may be the key to identifying physics beyond the sm .",
