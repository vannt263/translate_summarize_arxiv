    "while it is clear that the active galactic nuclei are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , and that this accretion requires both a source of fuel and a trigger to remove angular momentum from the fuel , the origin of the fuel and the trigger mechanism(s ) remain poorly understood . for luminous qsos , major mergers between gas - rich galaxies are considered the dominant mechanism and are the best , and perhaps only , candidate . many studies have shown that a large fraction of these galaxies are morphologically disturbed , with close neighbors , tidal tails , multiple nuclei , or linked by luminous matter to other galaxies @xcite .",
    "these results have motivated the hypothesis that lower - luminosity agn in the local universe are , like qsos , triggered and fueled by galaxy mergers or at least interactions , even though there is no evidence to support the claim that mergers are the trigger for low - luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "if gas - rich mergers or interactions are the primary trigger for these lower - luminosity agn , there should be higher agn fractions in environments where galaxies have an abundant supply of gas and frequent interactions . while the cluster environment has very high number densities , the galaxies in the centers of rich clusters have less cold gas than those in less dense environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the high pairwise velocity dispersions of cluster members may be too large to allow the formation of bound pairs inside the virial radius ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in contrast , galaxies in the field have abundant supplies of cold gas , but the relatively low galaxy number density may counterbalance the abundance of fuel . between these two extremes ,",
    "the intermediate group environment could provide the ideal circumstances for the triggering and fueling of low - luminosity agn in the nearby universe , at least if mergers and interactions make a substantial contribution ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies in groups have sufficiently modest velocity dispersions , numerous neighbors , and available cold gas to trigger and fuel agn .",
    "many observations have shown that agn are rarer in clusters when selected via emission - line diagnostics @xcite .",
    "recent observations with the the sloan digital sky survey have shown this holds across a wide range in galaxy number density , specifically for the most luminous agn @xcite . these results have readily been explained with the argument outlined above , namely that insufficient cold gas reservoirs and high velocity dispersions discourage the triggering and fueling of agn in the cluster environment .",
    "however , these same observations have indicated that the differences between environments fade for less luminous agn , and additionally samples of lower - luminosity agn may vary substantially depending on the selection technique employed .",
    "the differences in member morphology and physical environment between clusters and the field , as well as the relatively unbiased nature of x - ray observations , prompted @xcite to conduct a survey for x - ray agn in nearby clusters .",
    "they found a factor of five higher agn fraction than previous studies , where the agn were identified to have x - ray luminosities @xmath11 @xmath6  in host galaxies more luminous than @xmath8 mag .",
    "this dramatic increase was attributed to the greater sensitivity of x - ray observations to lower - luminosity agn relative to visible - wavelength emission - line diagnostics @xcite because the contrast between x - ray emission from agn and other physical processes ( low - mass x - ray binaries , hot gas , and star formation ) is higher than in the case of the emission - line diagnostics .    to date only a small number of studies",
    "have attempted to extend work on x - ray selected agn to the lower - velocity dispersion group environment .",
    "the first of these was a study of optically - selected groups at @xmath12 by @xcite .",
    "these authors only identified one agn via x - ray selection out of 140 galaxies in eight groups , yet found five based on emission lines .",
    "more recently , @xcite compared two , more massive groups and four clusters at similar redshifts and found a significantly higher x - ray selected agn fraction in the groups compared to the clusters .",
    "one of the main goals of the present study is to dramatically improve on the small group sample in the @xcite study , as well as to provide a larger sample of more massive groups than those in the @xcite study to better span the range of galaxy density from the field to clusters .",
    "while the groups in the @xcite sample are representative of those found in redshift surveys , they are otherwise a fairly heterogeneous sample .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray selection of this sample strongly suggests that these are all virialized systems .",
    "this local sample also provides a valuable benchmark for observations of the agn fraction in groups and clusters at higher redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , at @xmath13 @xcite find a similar fraction of x - ray selected agn in optically - selected groups as @xcite in the local universe .",
    "our other motivation is to investigate the role of galaxy morphology on the observed agn fraction , as well as on the selection of agn .",
    "observations of many galaxies have shown that there is a strong correlation between the mass of the smbh at the center of a given galaxy and the velocity dispersion or luminosity of the host galaxy s spheroid component @xcite .",
    "these relationships imply the coevolution of smbhs and spheroids , and many authors have suggested that agn may actively impact the evolution of the host galaxy by quenching star formation @xcite . since agn are a consequence of matter accreting onto the central smbh , and the relation between smbh mass and bulge properties implies a connection in their evolution , there may be a relation between the incidence of agn and galaxy morphology .",
    "observations by @xcite with the nearby palomar seyfert survey , and more recent work with sdss @xcite , indicate that this is the case .",
    "these studies find that seyferts are preferentially found in early - type spirals with a significant bulge",
    ". one potential interpretation of this result is that because early - type galaxies of a given mass will have larger smbhs compared to late - type galaxies of the same mass , if their smbhs both accrete at the same fixed fraction of the eddington rate , then the early - type galaxy is more likely to be detected in a luminosity - limited sample .",
    "this is important for comparing galaxy populations between groups , clusters , and the field because galaxy morphology is observed to be a strong function of local galaxy density @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many of the physical processes that are invoked to explain the relation between galaxy morphology and density may also have relevance for the available fuel supply for agn .",
    "these include mergers and ram - pressure stripping via interactions with the hot icm @xcite , evaporation of the cold ism by the host icm @xcite , and starvation of new gas that would otherwise replenish the ism @xcite .",
    "there are thus correlations between morphology and the incidence of agn , and between morphology and galaxy environment .",
    "it is therefore necessary to take morphology into account in order to determine if any variation in agn fraction with environment is directly due to the environment itself , or indirectly due to the change in the mix of galaxy types with environment .    to disentangle the effects of morphology and environment we present new observations of rich groups and poor clusters selected from the noras sample of @xcite .",
    "these observations and the x - ray agn classification procedure are described in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] .",
    "in addition , we use spectroscopic data from sdss to classify agn based on emission - line diagnostics and compare these agn to those selected via x - ray emission .",
    "we then combine these new data with previous work @xcite to study the incidence of agn as a function of environment and morphology .",
    "the morphological classification is described in detail in  [ sec : morphology ] , and the agn fractions are presented in  [ sec : agnfractions ] .",
    "the results , including a statistical analysis , are described in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the final section contains a summary of our main results . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath14 @xmath2   mpc@xmath15 .",
    "previous studies of x - ray agn and environment have concentrated on rich clusters @xcite and optically - selected groups @xcite .",
    "x - ray detected groups represent the intermediate mass - scale between rich clusters and poor groups . to study the x - ray agn population in x - ray detected groups , we observed a sample of seven low - redshift x - ray groups with the _ xmm - newton _   telescope .",
    "the groups were selected from the noras catalog , which provides a large , uniform sample of x - ray bright groups and clusters found in the rosat all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "our groups were selected based on the following three criteria : 1 ) x - ray luminosities between @xmath16 @xmath6  and @xmath17 @xmath6   in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band .",
    "this luminosity range was chosen to be comparable to the luminosity range of the intermediate redshift x - ray groups in the sample of @xcite , potentially allowing a comparison of similar systems from redshift zero to @xmath18 ; 2 ) redshifts between 0.04 and 0.06 . this redshift slice was chosen because it allows all of the groups to be studied out to approximately the virial radius in a single _ xmm - newton _",
    "pointing ; 3 ) spectroscopic coverage from the sdss .",
    "sdss spectroscopic coverage provides good membership information for each group .",
    "this last criterion also allows us to calculate an estimate of the agn fraction based on standard emission - line diagnostics ( see   [ sec : bptclassification ] below ) and to perform morphological fits of the surface brightness profiles of these objects from the sdss imaging data ( see   [ sec : morphology ] ) .",
    "the above selection criteria result in a sample of 14 x - ray luminous groups and poor clusters . from these 14 groups",
    ", we selected seven that span the x - ray luminosity range of interest .",
    "the seven x - ray groups were observed by _ xmm - newton _  between may 2007 and december 2007 .",
    "the integration times varied from 12 to 40 ksec .",
    "all observations were obtained in full - frame mode with the thin optical blocking filter .",
    "the data were processed with version 7.0 of the xmmsas software . for emos data we used only patterns 012 and apply the # xmmea_em flag filtering , while for epn data we used patterns 04 and set the flag equal to zero .",
    "we eliminated periods of high background using the method described in @xcite .",
    "this procedure involves filtering the data in several energy bands .",
    "we begin by applying a cut on the high energy ( @xmath1910 kev ) count rate of 0.35 counts s@xmath15 for emos data and 1.0 counts s@xmath15 for epn data .",
    "we then applied a @xmath20 clipping to the source - free count rate in three energy bands .",
    "for this process , we used time bins of length 100 seconds .",
    "time bins with rates more than @xmath20 from the mean are then removed until the mean is stable .",
    "background flaring was very severe for one of the groups ( rxcj1225.2 + 3213 ) and resulted in no usable data .",
    "we therefore eliminated this group from our sample . for the remaining six groups ,",
    "the final exposure times were in the range @xmath21 10 to 23 ksec for the emos detectors .",
    "we note that we only include groups in our _ xmm - newton _  analysis for which we can reach a lower limit of @xmath22 @xmath6  at a radius of 13@xmath23 .",
    "to better constrain the agn population in groups , we supplemented our sample with additional groups that have _ xmm - newton _  observations available from the archive .",
    "these groups were also selected from the noras catalog in the same x - ray luminosity range described above ( criterion 1 ) .",
    "we also required that these groups had spectroscopic coverage in the sdss ( criterion 3 ) .",
    "however , we did not require these groups to be in the redshift range 0.04 to 0.06 . to insure that a significant fraction of the group members were within the _ xmm - newton _   field of view we only considered groups that had _ xmm - newton _  coverage out to a radius of at least 250 kpc . using these revised criteria , we added another five groups to our sample , bringing the total number of noras - selected groups to eleven .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  observations for these additional groups were reduced following the same method described above .",
    "the final exposure times for all five of these groups is at least 10 ksec in the emos detectors .",
    "membership was determined with the method described in @xcite and largely based on the available sdss spectroscopy in the fields on these groups and clusters .",
    "we start with all galaxies located within a projected distance of 1 mpc from the center with a recessional velocity within @xmath24 @xmath2  of the mean velocity .",
    "we then calculate the velocity dispersion of the system using the biweight estimator @xcite .",
    "objects with velocities greater than three times the velocity dispersion away from the mean are then removed from the sample and a new mean and dispersion are calculated .",
    "this process is continued until no further objects are removed .",
    "note that although we have estimated the global properties from galaxies located within 1 mpc of the center , our agn analysis is restricted to the smaller radii probed by the _ xmm - newton _  data .",

    "while very luminous agn can be unambiguously identified in almost any energy band , agn become progressively more challenging to identify at lower luminosities when their emission may be equal or even substantially less than that of their host galaxy .",
    "these lower - luminosity agn are important to identify to maximize the sample of agn for demographic studies .",
    "it is also important to understand the completeness of the agn selection to connect to other studies . at a minimum",
    ", the completeness should be expressed in terms of luminosity in some band , although results are more readily compared with theory if they can be expressed in terms of bolometric luminosity or accretion rate relative to the mass of the black hole . here",
    "we identify agn via their x - ray luminosity , which is estimated to represent on order 10% of the bolometric luminosity with small scatter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and consequently it is a reasonable proxy .",
    "x - rays also have the advantage that they are relatively less sensitive to the effects of extinction .",
    "for the low - luminosity agn we consider here , other physical processes can also produce comparable x - ray emission from galaxies , so in the first subsection below we describe our agn classification technique in detail .",
    "the main alternative method to identify agn is via visible - wavelength emission - line ratios and we compare our x - ray classification to this other method in the following subsection ( @xmath42  [ sec : bptclassification ] ) .",
    "in addition to careful selection of agn via either method , characterization of how the agn population varies across different environments can be reasonably performed with a measurement of the fraction of all galaxies of a given morphology that host agn . in previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the agn fraction was defined as the fraction of galaxies with absolute magnitude @xmath43 mag ( vega ) that host agn with a broad - band [ 0.3 - 8kev ] x - ray luminosity of @xmath11 @xmath6 . to identify a comparable host luminosity range with the noras sample",

    "we also adopt the evolving absolute magnitude threshold of @xmath47 introduced by @xcite to compare samples across a wide range in redshift , where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . for the present sample",
    "the evolution term ( @xmath50 ) is negligible and the main result is a second threshold approximately one magnitude more luminous than the previous magnitude cut .",
    "this higher threshold is useful because the agn fraction increases when a higher luminosity threshold is used @xcite .",
    "we created images in the 0.5 to 8 kev band for each detector using the flare - cleaned event files spatially binned to give 2@xmath51 pixels .",
    "the images for the three detectors were combined to form a final image using the sas task emosaic . to identify x - ray sources , we ran the task ewavelet on the merged image with a detection threshold of 5@xmath52 .",
    "the x - ray detections were then compared to the known members to determine matches .",
    "we restrict this analysis to objects within 13@xmath23 of the field center .",

    "this makes searching for an agn component difficult for the central galaxies and we have therefore excluded these objects from our analysis .",
    "this is also the case with the analysis of the richer clusters in our sample @xcite .    for each member detected by _",
    ", we extract a surface brightness profile to determine the extent of the x - ray emission .",
    "we extracted source spectra in circular regions extending to where the surface brightness profile reaches the background level .",

    "this type includes any additional background from the diffuse intragroup medium at the location of the source .",
    "response files ( rmfs and arfs ) were constructed for the location of the source using the sas tasks rmfgen and arfgen , respectively .",
    "source spectra were binned to have 25 counts bin@xmath15 .",
    "all spectral fitting was performed using xspec ( version 12.3 ) . as noted briefly above , the four main physical processes that can produce substantial ( @xmath54 @xmath6 ) broad - band ( 0.38kev ) x - ray emission from galaxies are agn , a population of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , thermal emission from hot gas , and emission from the high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) and supernova remnants associated with substantial recent star formation .",
    "we classify an x - ray source as an agn if the observed x - ray luminosity exceeds that expected from these other physical processes that can produce x - ray emission .",

    "* ) and classify a galaxy as an agn if the x - ray luminosity exceeds the expected contribution from these other sources of emission .    because these _ xmm _ observations often have sufficient counts for spectral fits , we fit two spectral models to better classify agn when the data are sufficient .",
    "these models are a single power - law component to represent the combined emission of the lmxbs and any agn component and a thermal component to represent any emission from hot gas .",

    "this improves the classification over , e.g. @xcite as we can then compare the luminosity of the best - fit power - law model to just the expected emission from lmxbs , hmxbs , and an agn component , and exclude the thermal model because of its different spectrum .",

    "are sufficiently luminous in the @xmath55band that we expect a substantial thermal component .",
    "five of the six sources are above the relation by at least @xmath81 and we classify these galaxies as x - ray agn , although one of these is not included in our statistical analysis because it has @xmath86 @xmath6 .",
    "we also note that none of these 14 galaxies appears to have sufficient star formation to contribute significantly to the x - ray luminosity . to check this we estimated star formation rates for each galaxy from the h@xmath87 flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and then calculated the expected x - ray luminosity from @xcite . in all cases the estimated x - ray luminosity due to star formation was at least an order of magnitude below the observed luminosity .",
    "for the five groups and clusters in common with @xcite we retain the same agn classifications presented in that paper .",
    "the traditional technique to identify low - luminosity agn in emission - line galaxies is through use of line ratios such as @xmath88\\lambda5007/\\mathrm{h}\\beta$ ]  and @xmath89\\lambda6584/\\mathrm{h}\\alpha$ ]  on a `` bpt diagram '' @xcite .",
    "we have measurements of these four emission lines for most ( 349 ) of the galaxies in the sample from the noras catalog from the mpa - jhu galaxy catalog for the sdss data release  7 .",
    "we use the emission - line measurements and errors calculated by the mpa - jhu group , which have been corrected for stellar absorption , and then calculate emission line ratios .",
    "if the line flux measurements for @xmath89\\lambda6584/\\mathrm{h}\\alpha$ ]  are larger than 3 times the error associated with the measurements , we keep the data for analysis . we are less conservative for the @xmath88\\lambda5007/\\mathrm{h}\\beta$ ]  ratio because galaxies with precise @xmath89\\lambda6584/\\mathrm{h}\\alpha$ ]   measurements can be unambiguously identified as agn even if the @xmath88\\lambda5007/\\mathrm{h}\\beta$ ]   measurements are less certain ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , edge - on galaxies might obscure the bluer @xmath88 $ ] and @xmath90 lines , leading to a misclassification .",
    "we hope to keep these possibly obscured but still unambiguous agn in our sample by being less stringent with our condition on the @xmath88\\lambda5007/\\mathrm{h}\\beta$ ]  measurement errors .    of the 349 galaxies in the mpa - jhu galaxy catalog , 116 have sufficiently bright spectral lines to place on the bpt diagram shown in figure  [ fig : bpt ] .",
    "this figure illustrates the values of @xmath89\\lambda6584/\\mathrm{h}\\alpha$ ]  and @xmath88\\lambda5007/\\mathrm{h}\\beta$ ]   for these 116 galaxies .",
    "we identify galaxies as `` bpt agn '' if these two line ratios place them above the threshold suggested by @xcite as the maximum limit that could be produced by extreme starburst activity .",
    "this is a very conservative limit and many confirmed agn do not meet this criterion . for reference , we also show the less conservative threshold of @xcite . of the 116 galaxies with sufficient emission - line detections to fall on this diagram , 14 were identified as bpt agn .",
    "a total of 199 out of the 349 galaxies with sdss spectra also have @xmath43 mag , so the bpt agn fraction for this sample is @xmath91 ( all bpt agn have @xmath92 mag ) .",
    "for comparison , six of these 199 galaxies or @xmath93% were identified as x - ray agn ( note that not all x - ray agn had sufficient spectral - line data ) .",
    "it is also striking that only one galaxy is classified as both an x - ray agn and a bpt agn .",

    "though galaxy morphology has been used extensively to study galaxy evolution , until recently this property was determined by eye .",
    "this process , though largely repeatable , lacks quantitative robustness and is a protracted process for large numbers of objects .",
    "the alternative  measuring morphology in an automated fashion  is not simple to implement . only in the last decade , with the development of large - format , linear detectors and substantial computational resources , has it become commonplace to classify galaxies using quantitative and repeatable techniques .",
    "datasets consisting of large numbers of galaxies have made visual inspection intractable as a method for determining morphology ( although there have been novel approaches for morphological identification via visual inspection ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while abundant computational resources have made large - scale , quantitative analyses more feasible .",
    "various methods to ascertain morphology quantitatively exist in the literature @xcite , and we chose to use the galaxy fitting code galfit @xcite to measure the morphological properties for galaxies in our sample .",
    "one of our main motivations for the choice of galfit was the work of @xcite , who compared galfit to gim2d @xcite and concluded that galfit has advantages in its ability to simultaneously fit neighboring galaxies in a crowded field and benefits from a dramatic increase in execution speed .",
    "galfit is designed to extract structural components from galaxies by fitting two - dimensional light profiles with an arbitrary number of parametric functions that are suitable for describing the surface brightness distribution of galaxies .",
    "although the code was authored to fit subtle structures of well - resolved galaxies with many - component models simultaneously , it is also effective at handling large numbers of galaxies imaged at lower resolution by fitting their surface brightness profiles with relatively simple models .",
    "we utilize the latter capability in our analysis .",
    "galfit takes as input a simple text file and is very customizable , allowing easy extension via a wrapper script .",
    "a final advantage is that galfit can use a variety of analytic functions singly or simultaneously , including the srsic profile . in the next subsections we describe the fitting procedure in more detail , including how we parametrize galaxy morphology , and present the results of our fits of the x - ray and bpt agn .",
    "we fit models to all of the galaxies in our sample that have imaging data .",
    "we have adopted two parameters to quantify galaxy morphology : the value of the srsic index @xmath95 and the bulge - to - total flux ratio @xmath96 .",
    "the srsic profile is defined to be : @xmath97 , \\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the surface brightness ( flux per unit area ) at the effective radius @xmath99 , @xmath99 is the half - light radius , and the eponymous index @xmath95 characterizes the shape of the light profile .",
    "the parameter @xmath100 is set by the constraint that @xmath99 is the half - light radius .",
    "the srsic index @xmath95 has been commonly used to separate early - type and late - type galaxies in the literature .",
    "studies based on sdss imaging data find that @xmath101 is a reasonable point to distinguish these two types ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we too adopt @xmath102 to identify early - type galaxies .",
    "the bulge - to - total flux ratio is measured from a classic bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "here we fit a bulge component with a @xcite @xmath103 profile and a disk component with an exponential surface brightness profile .",
    "the fraction of the total flux in the bulge component relative to the total ( bulge + disk ) flux then provides the ratio @xmath96 . throughout this work",
    "we will primarily rely on the srsic index to classify galaxies , but we will use the @xmath96 as a consistency check on our results .",
    "note also that @xmath104 is equivalent to the @xmath103 profile and @xmath105 is equivalent to an exponential disk profile .",
    "when available we also compared our calculated morphological parameters to the sdss ` fracdev ` parameter , which is calculated by the sdss pipeline and serves as another quantitative measure of galaxy morphology .",
    "the ` fracdev ` parameter is very similar to our bulge - to - total flux decomposition .",
    "it is obtained by fitting the surface brightness profile of a galaxy with exponential and de  vaucouleurs components and then keeping the fractional contribution of the latter .",
    "@xcite identified ` fracdev `  @xmath106 to identify early - type galaxies .",
    "as noted above , galfit accepts an input text file that specifies the initial conditions for models and other options and parameters related to the fit .",
    "galfit can accommodate as many independent models as the user desires , limited only by computational resources .",
    "it is also possible to simultaneously fit adjacent or blended objects in addition to the target to remove potential contamination and obtain a more robust fit .",
    "galfit convolves the model with a point spread function ( psf ) supplied by the user , subtracts the convolved model from the input image , and computes the reduced chi squared , @xmath107 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the number of degrees of freedom in the model , flux and model are the pixel values of the original image and analytic model , respectively , and @xmath110 is the error in each pixel .",
    "galfit minimizes @xmath107  using a levenberg - marquardt algorithm , a downhill - gradient type algorithm suited for searching large parameter spaces quickly .",
    "additional and optional input includes a bad pixel map specifying which pixels should be excluded from the @xmath107  calculation ( i.e. masked out ) and initial guesses for the many free parameters , including the astrometric and morphological quantities of the target .",
    "galfit is useful in its extensibility and we took advantage of this by creating a wrapper script in python and an algorithm to fit many target objects with little to no user interaction .",
    "the results are comparable to a human user fine tuning galfit input parameters until an ideal fit is obtained .",
    "the input to this process is a list of astrometric coordinates of targets and the fits images in which these targets are imaged . for each target",
    "the script determines if it lies within the boundaries of a given image and obtains initial morphological parameters ( e.g. a measure of the galaxy s radius , magnitude , ellipticity , object position , and position angle ) with sextractor @xcite . at this stage",
    "we retain information about all detected objects within some arbitrary number ( found using trial and error ) of effective radii from the target .",
    "the fitting region supplied to galfit is determined in a similar way .",
    "based on the parameters of the objects in the field of view , we either add the pixels associated with the object to the bad pixel file , masking them out and removing them from the @xmath107  calculation and fitting procedure , or fit the object in addition to the target .",
    "this discriminatory algorithm compares object brightness to the target brightness ( e.g. an object very much dimmer than the target will likely be masked out rather than fit ) and the distance from the target ( e.g. an object separated by many target galaxy - radii will likely be masked out rather than fit ) . in this way we only fit additional objects if they are likely to contaminate the fit of our target , and thus its morphological properties . fitting a superfluous number of objects is computationally wasteful and complicates finding a unique minimum in @xmath107  space .",
    "our wrapper script generates a galfit input file for both a single component srsic profile fit and a two component srsic profile @xmath111 exponential disk fit .",
    "several iterations of this dual method fitting occur if the resultant @xmath107  values for the two parameterizations differ by more than a small amount , with the previous fit parameters used for subsequent iterations , to insure that the solution obtained is not the result of the minimization algorithm getting lost in a local minimum .",
    "this propensity to get lost in a local minimum and the question of the uniqueness of a multi - component solution in large parameters spaces is an issue for algorithms like galfit , and @xcite addresses this question in depth ( see their @xmath42  3.3 ) .",
    "another requirement for galfit is an estimate of the psf shape .",
    "these were created manually for each image by approximating them with a gaussian generated with the standard ` gauss ` task in iraf .",
    "effective radii of the psfs were estimated by examining several stars in each image .",
    "we determined that small variations in the radius of the psf negligibly affected the parameters of the model , confirming the robustness of this approximate method of psf creation .",
    "the three - image results for all of the x - ray agn are shown in figure  [ fig : agnexamples ] , while the results for the bpt agn are shown in figure  [ fig : bptagnexamples ] .",
    "the model parameters associated with all of these fits are listed in tables  [ tbl : agnexamples ] and [ tbl : bptagnexamples ] .",
    "only one object falls in both samples and consequently appears in both figures and tables .",
    "while these figures demonstrate our results on agn , described further below in  [ sec : bptagn ] , they also are fairly representative of our morphological fits to the inactive group and cluster galaxies .",

    "stubborn objects that are not well fit by our procedure persist , though they are relatively few . as noted above , galfit was originally developed by @xcite with the purpose of decomposing the complex structure of well resolved galaxies .",

    "specifically , for all galaxies more luminous than @xmath7 we find that the x - ray agn fraction is @xmath209 for groups and @xmath210 for clusters , or a factor of two higher in groups .",
    "the trend is somewhat more pronounced for the early - type galaxies , where the agn fraction is @xmath211 in groups and @xmath212 for clusters .",
    "this demonstrates that the agn fraction is a factor of two higher in groups relative to clusters and that the agn fraction is similarly higher when just early - type host galaxies are considered .",
    "the errorbars on these binned results , shown in the righthand panels of figures  [ fig : xray_versus_sigma ]  and  [ fig : earlytypexray_v_sigma ] , show the same single - sided , @xmath154 confidence intervals as the results for individual groups and clusters . in principle , if these binned error bars exactly overlap , then each population is distinct from the other with 84% confidence , and if not , then the confidence level can be obtained by expanding or contracting the confidence limits until they exactly overlap .",
    "however , there is additional uncertainty due to the choice of @xmath1  @xmath2  to separate groups and clusters .",
    "while this choice was physically motivated and is not an unreasonable point to divide the sample , there are additional , physically meaningful values of the velocity dispersion to separate groups and clusters . for example",
    ", we could have chosen to divide groups and clusters at @xmath213  @xmath2  instead of 500  @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , proper statistical analysis of the difference between the two samples needs to include an additional penalty that reflects the other options for binning the data .",
    "we account for this by raising the previous probability to an exponent that represents all of the other ways we could have binned the data .",
    "thus , the probability that two populations are distinct from one another is @xmath214 where cl is the confidence limit at which the error bars just overlap , and @xmath215 is the number of possible groupings .",
    "for example , a confidence limit of 84% ( one - sigma ) and three possible groupings yields a 93% probability that the two populations are distinct . note that in @xcite a similar analysis was performed to show that groups and clusters were different from one another , but there all possible combinations of the data were considered . in our case there are in principle @xmath216 possible ways to create two samples out of our data , but we do not adopt this approach as most of these options are nonconsecutive and not physically motivated . from this analysis",
    "we conclude that the x - ray agn and early - type x - ray agn fractions are higher in groups relative to clusters at the 85% and 92% level , respectively , for the @xmath152 sample .",
    "the statistical significance for the @xmath43 mag sample is lower ( 77% and 76% , respectively ) , although the trend is consistent .",
    "another intriguing question we can begin to answer is how the agn fractions in groups and clusters compare to the field value . while there is little data on x - ray selected agn fractions in the field , the study of @xcite examined the x - ray fraction in early - type galaxies as a function of redshift . when calculated with the same selection criteria as we employ ,",
    "the field early - type agn fraction is 6.6% for @xmath43 mag ( b. lehmer , private communication , see also * ? ? ?",
    "intriguingly , the group and cluster early - type agn fractions are both consistent within the errorbars with the field value , although the cluster fraction is lower and the group fraction is higher .",
    "the eight groups and three poor clusters selected from the noras sample have sdss spectra as well as imaging data .",
    "consequently , we were also able to classify them as bpt agn or not based on their visible - wavelength emission line ratios ( see   [ sec : bptclassification ] ) .",
    "we calculate the bpt agn fraction as the ratio of bpt agn in galaxies more luminous than @xmath8 mag divided by the total number of galaxies above this luminosity with sdss spectra .",
    "as noted above , there are 14 agn above the @xcite classification line of 199 total galaxies with spectra .",
    "six of these bpt agn are in 88 cluster galaxies and eight are in 111 group galaxies .",
    "the corresponding bpt agn fractions are @xmath217 for groups and @xmath218 for clusters .",
    "these fractions are consistent .",
    "only one of these 14 bpt agn is also classified as an x - ray agn and it is a member of a group ( rxcj0844.9 + 4258 ) . for comparison",
    "the x - ray agn fraction is @xmath219 , although is drawn from a larger host galaxy population than the two bpt fractions quoted above .",
    "our bpt agn fraction is comparable but somewhat lower than the x - ray agn fraction of @xmath220 ( based on one object ) found by @xcite for @xmath43 mag .",
    "their bpt agn fraction is also @xmath221% , although this was calculated for @xmath222 mag . at this lower threshold",
    "they measure an x - ray agn fraction of @xmath223% ( one out of @xmath224 galaxies ) .",
    "we similarly find bpt agn that are not classified as x - ray agn and x - ray agn that are not classified as bpt agn .",
    "we also compare the morphologies of the bpt agn and the x - ray agn to determine if the lower fraction of high - luminosity agn in denser regions found in sdss @xcite is correlated with the morphology  density relation . to make this comparison we plot the cumulative fraction of x - ray and bpt agn as a function of srsic index in figure  [ fig : bptvxraymorphologies ] .",
    "while this figure may suggest that the x - ray agn are more likely to be in early - type host galaxies , both a ks test and a mann - whitney @xmath225test indicate that the samples are consistent .",
    "the bpt agn morphologies are also in very good agreement with the galaxies not classified as agn by either method . the x - ray and bpt agn shown in this figure are only the subset with spectroscopy from sdss , and therefore not all of the x - ray agn are shown .",
    "the results of the previous sections have shown that there is tentative evidence that the agn fraction is lower in clusters than in groups , and that this difference also holds when only early - type galaxies are considered separately .",
    "this second statement is important because it helps to break the degeneracy between morphology and density and between morphology and agn fraction .",
    "thus the larger fraction of agn in groups indicates that the agn fraction is higher in both early and late - type galaxies and is not simply due to a larger fraction of late - type galaxies in lower velocity dispersion environments .",
    "these results have interesting implications for agn triggering and fueling , as well as the evolution of galaxies in groups and clusters .",
    "if true , one of the main implications is that early - type galaxies in groups are more likely to be agn than their counterparts in clusters .",
    "this could be explained by higher cold gas fractions or greater likelihood of triggering , such as due to an interaction ; most likely both play a role . in clusters ,",
    "the higher rates of galaxy interactions and gas stripping could remove potential fuel from the galaxies more efficiently than those same interactions driving angular momentum loss and agn fueling .",
    "it has also been proposed @xcite that smaller , less massive groups are the ideal environment for agn activity caused by mergers . though these studies focus on higher - luminosity agn and rely on a different triggering mechanism than in this work , it would be interesting to investigate whether our weakly observed trend continues to even lower - density group environments discussed by @xcite .    these results also help to explain the range of conclusions that have been drawn about the agn fraction as a function of environment .",
    "for example , @xcite found the bpt agn fraction in clusters is a factor of five times lower than in the field .",
    "many studies have confirmed this result for higher - luminosity agn , yet found less of a difference at lower luminosities @xcite .",
    "in contrast , x - ray observations of clusters find many more agn than via the bpt technique @xcite , while observations of optically - selected , poor groups of galaxies identify a larger fraction of bpt agn relative to x - ray agn @xcite .",
    "our spectroscopic analysis of the rich groups and poor clusters selected from the noras catalog demonstrates that much of these pronounced differences in the literature are due to differences in selection because the bpt agn and x - ray agn are nearly disjoint populations .",
    "there are substantial populations of both types of agn in groups , while this is less often the case in higher galaxy density environments .",
    "the very low density groups in the @xcite sample are unlikely to be virialized systems , even though they are typical of groups found via redshift surveys such as sdss .",
    "the x - ray emission from the more massive groups and poor clusters suggests that these are virialized systems , and the change between mostly bpt agn and x - ray agn may reflect a change in the dominant accretion mode between unvirialized and virialized systems .",
    "this is further supported by the cluster sample of @xcite , who found few bpt agn and none that were not also detected as x - ray agn , although many of these spectra were also of low signal - to - noise . for comparison",
    ", we find approximately equal numbers of bpt agn in groups and clusters , including examples of bpt agn in clusters that are not x - ray agn .",
    "nevertheless , from the several previous studies @xcite the trend is that while the agn population is lower in clusters than in groups , the decrease is larger for bpt agn than for x - ray agn .",
    "the more constant x - ray agn fraction with local density is also similar to the trend seen in radio agn by @xcite , who found that the fraction of radio agn is relatively insensitive to environment , compared to bpt agn .",
    "a potential physical explanation of these trends is that the bpt and x - ray agn trace different accretion modes .",
    "the bpt agn exhibit line ratios characteristic of agn whose spectral energy distributions are well - matched by thin disk models where the accretion rate is greater than @xmath226% of the eddington rate .",
    "in contrast , the weak or absent emission lines , at least in these moderate signal - to - noise spectra , combined with their substantial x - ray luminosities , suggest radiatively - inefficient accretion with lower accretion rates relative to eddington @xcite .",
    "this simple picture is supported by the weak trend that the x - ray agn are more often found in early - type hosts than the bpt agn .",
    "as both populations have comparable total luminosities , the x - ray agn hosts have larger spheroids and are expected to have larger black hole masses as a result . as radio and x - ray emission are reasonably well correlated in these radiatively inefficient models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this hypothesis is also consistent with the distribution of the observed radio agn fraction .",
    "another interesting implication of this work is that the average agn fraction for the groups and clusters together is similar to the field early - type x - ray agn fraction of @xmath227% ( b.  lehmer 2006 , private communication ) , although the groups alone have a higher fraction .",
    "one interpretation of this result is that while galaxies in the field typically have substantial supplies of cold gas , perhaps even more than found in group galaxies , this is offset by a lower rate of triggering due to the lower density , at least if interactions and mergers play an important role .",
    "this implies that the cluster environment is too dense , the field environment is too sparse , and the group environment is `` just right '' to fuel and trigger x - ray agn .",
    "further observations are required to draw firm conclusions about the relative agn fraction in the field , groups , and clusters , yet if the variation we find is confirmed it would strongly point to the importance of galaxy interactions ( although not necessarily mergers ) for fueling even lower - luminosity agn .",
    "this would be surprising , as it conflicts with current studies based on companion fractions @xcite , although those studies are all based on bpt agn , rather than x - ray agn .",
    "the distribution of agn as a function of environment is a potentially valuable probe of the fueling and triggering of agn , as well as the connection between galaxy and black hole evolution .",
    "we have conducted a new survey of eleven rich groups and poor clusters selected from the noras catalog at @xmath0 to measure the agn fraction as a function of environment .",
    "our group sample , defined to be environments with @xmath228  @xmath2 , contains eight new groups plus two previously published in @xcite and thus represents a factor of five increase in sample size .",
    "the cluster sample contains three new clusters and three previously published , or a factor of two increase in sample size .",
    "we identify x - ray agn in these groups and clusters with a combination of spectral fits and flux ratio arguments to demonstrate that the x - ray emission from each x - ray agn is inconsistent with other sources of x - ray emission .",
    "the main result of this analysis is that the x - ray agn fraction is approximately a factor of two higher in groups than in clusters .",
    "this trend is apparent for both agn in host galaxies more luminous than @xmath8 mag and for more luminous hosts with @xmath152 , although the difference has greater statistical significance for the higher luminosity threshold .",
    "the x - ray agn fractions for the higher threshold are @xmath229 for clusters and @xmath4 for groups .",
    "there is a 85% probability that the group agn fraction is larger than the cluster agn fraction .",
    "this result may be more significant for the more luminous galaxy subsample due to the larger fraction of the most luminous galaxies that are x - ray agn .    because the incidence of agn in galaxies depends on host galaxy morphology , and the distribution of galaxy morphologies depends on environment ,",
    "we have conducted the first quantitative morphological analysis of the agn fraction in dense environments with these six clusters and ten groups .",
    "the morphological data for every confirmed group and cluster galaxy was obtained with the galfit software package by @xcite and used to separate early - type and late - type galaxies .",
    "we then calculated the x - ray agn fraction for just the early - type galaxy populations in the groups and clusters separately and found that the early - type agn fraction is also a factor of two higher in groups relative to clusters .",
    "for the higher galaxy luminosity threshold we find @xmath230 for clusters and @xmath10 for groups ( 92% confidence ) .",
    "the similar trends for early - type galaxies and all galaxies indicate that the agn fraction is not different simply because the morphological mix of galaxies changes as a function of environment , but rather that all galaxy types have a higher probability of hosting an agn in the group environment .",
    "in addition , the group value is also higher than the best estimate of the early - type agn fraction in the field .",
    "this may be because group galaxies , even early - type group galaxies , are more likely to have substantial cold gas reservoirs for agn fueling than cluster galaxies , while galaxy interactions are more likely to occur in groups than the field , or some combination of these effects .",
    "finally , we have also estimated the agn fraction based on emission - line diagnostics for the subset of the galaxies with sdss spectroscopy .",
    "there are 14 bpt agn in this subset of groups and clusters , as well as six of our nine x - ray agn .",
    "strikingly , these populations are nearly completely disjoint : only one agn meets our criterion as both an x - ray agn and as a bpt agn .",
    "this is a clear demonstration of how different selection techniques may identify different populations of agn .",
    "our morphological analysis shows that the host galaxies of these two agn types are marginally different in that the x - ray agn are more likely to be hosted by early - type galaxies .",
    "while the host galaxies for both agn populations are more luminous than @xmath43 mag , the earlier - type hosts for the x - ray agn imply relatively larger supermassive black holes compared to the bpt agn .",

    "<S> we find that the agn fraction in early - type galaxies is also lower in clusters @xmath9 compared to @xmath10 for the groups ( 92% significance ) , a result consistent with the hypothesis that the change in agn fraction is directly connected to environment . </S>"
