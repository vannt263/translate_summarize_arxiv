    "the theory of automatic groups was introduced in @xcite . if a group has an automatic structure , there exist efficient algorithms for enumerating elements and checking two elements which differ by multiplication on the right by only one generator . in  @xcite and further works , it was shown that many classes of finitely generated groups , such as hyperbolic groups , finitely generated abelian groups , braid groups , have automatic structures .",
