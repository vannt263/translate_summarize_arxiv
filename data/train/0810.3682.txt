    "most of the higgs efforts of the cdf and collaborations are centered on finding a standard model higgs boson .",
    "however the standard model is incomplete and there are proposed extensions to the standard model , many of which feature one or more higgs bosons as well . these are often similar to the standard model higgs , but differ in their couplings to other particles . for the purposes of this presentation ,",
    "i divide the higgs searches into two categories , fermiophobic higgs searches and susy higgs searches at high @xmath0 .",
    "in the fermiophobic higgs models , the higgs is assumed not to couple to fermions . at high masses",
    "it then decays to a w pair and at low masses to a photon pair .",
    "the high mass searches are done in the channel , searching for a higgs boson produced in association with a w boson .",
    "this is done in order to avoid the higher backgrounds associated with the channel .    the search for  @xcite looks for two same sign leptons and vetos on a third lepton .",
    "the sample is then divided according to lepton types .",
    "the final limit is extracted from the dilepton invariant mass distribution .",
    "the results can be seen in figure  [ p03 ] .",
    "the cdf search for  @xcite also looks for exactly two leptons of the same sign and divides the sample by lepton type , but it performs a simple counting experiment instead of extracting the limit from the dilepton invariant mass .",
    "the results can be seen in figure  [ p04 ] .    performed a search for  @xcite . that search employs a neural network to distinguish between photons and jets .",
    "the diphoton mass spectrum is then scanned for an excess and a mass dependent limit is set .",
    "the results can be seen in figure  [ p05 ] .    also performed a search for  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the vertex @xmath1 is suppressed and instead the vertex @xmath2 is employed , where @xmath3 is another higgs boson .",
    "the search only looks for three photons , allowing one photon to be lost .",
    "a cut on the transverse momentum of the photons is employed to separate out the background , and the remaining events are treated as a counting experiment .",
    "the results can be seen in figure  [ p06 ] .",
    "the susy higgs searches exploit the fact that at high @xmath0 the coupling of the higgs to bottom quark and tau leptons is enhanced with @xmath4 , which has a number of effects that are exploited in the search .",
    "the higgs cross section increases from femtobarns to picobarns .",
    "the higgs is often produced by the fusion of two bottom quarks producing a final state with two extra bottom quarks , which can be tagged to reduce backgrounds . furthermore the higgs decay changes and is in 90% of cases a pair of bottom quarks and in the remaining 10% into a pair of tau leptons .",
    "cdf performed a search for  @xcite , where the choice of one associated bottom jet was due to the better signal to background ratio compared to zero or two associated bottom jets . in the search the two and three jet distributions are fit to obtain the signal and background distributions . from this , mass dependent cross section limits are obtained , and @xmath0 limits which take the higgs width effects at high @xmath0 .",
    "the results can be seen in figure  [ p09 ] .    also performed a search for  @xcite . for the search",
    "the data is split into three , four and five jet bins . within these bins",
    "the two and three jet distributions are fit to obtain the signal and background contributions . from these the mass dependent @xmath0 limit is extracted .",
    "the results can be seen in figure  [ p10 ] .",
    "cdf performed a search for  @xcite . due to the higher purity of the ditau sample",
    "no additional bottom jets are required .",
    "the sample is split according to the tau decay mode .",
    "the signal template is fit to the ditau visible mass spectrum to obtain the mass and model dependent @xmath0 limits .",
    "the results can be seen in figure  [ p11 ]",
    ".    performed two searches for higgs decaying into a tau pair  @xcite .",
    "the one search is in the channel . for this",
    "the sample is divided by tau decay type and run period .",
    "the signal template is then fit to the visible mass spectrum to extract the model and mass dependent @xmath0 limit .",
    "the results can be seen in figure  [ p12 ] .",
    "the other search is in the search , which tags an additional bottom quark to reduce the background rate .",
    "one tau is required to decay to a muon , while the other is required to decay hadronically .",
    "the sample is then divided according to the hadronic tau decay type . in each decay category",
    "a counting experiment is performed to extract the model and mass dependent @xmath0 limits .",
    "the results can be seen in figure  [ p13 ] .",
    "the cdf and collaborations have performed a large number of searches for signs of a fermiophobic or susy higgs . in the absence of signal",
    ", limits have been set on the various models . for the near future ,",
    "updates to several of these searches can be expected , as well as a combination of these searches into an overall tevatron limit ."
