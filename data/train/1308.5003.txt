    "transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions and fragmentation functions are formally introduced as an extension to the parton model description of nucleon structure and an important tool to calculate hadronic processes . in the last few years , these distribution functions have attracted great attentions in hadron physics community . in particular , the novel single transverse spin asymmetries ( ssas ) in semi - inclusive hadron production in deep inelastic scattering processes ( sidis ) observed by the hermes , compass , and jlab hall a collaborations , have stimulated much theoretical developments .",
    "the tmd factorization provides a solid theoretical framework to understand these spin asymmetries .",
    "moreover , together with the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , the tmds unveil the internal structure of nucleon in a three dimension fashion , the so - called nucleon tomography .",
    "these topics are major emphases in the planed electron - ion collider  @xcite .",
    "an important theoretical aspect of the tmd parton distribution and fragmentation functions is the energy evolution , which was thoroughly studied in the early paper by collins and soper  @xcite .",
    "this evolution is referred as the collins - soper ( cs ) evolution equation .",
    "it has been applied to formulate the perturbative resummation of large double logarithms in hard scattering processes where transverse momentum distribution are measured .",
    "the associated resummation is called collins - soper - sterman ( css )  @xcite resummation , or transverse momentum resummation . in these hard processes , because of two separate scales , there exist large double logarithms in each order of perturbative calculations ( originally from a qed calculation by sudakov  @xcite ) , and the relevant resummation has to be taken in the calculation  @xcite .",
    "for example , in drell - yan lepton pair production in @xmath0 collisions , the invariant mass @xmath1 is much larger than the total transverse momentum of the lepton pair @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where perturbative corrections will induce large logarithms @xmath9 .",
    "the resummation of these large logarithms are performed by applying the tmd factorization and the cs evolution .",
    "successful applications have been made to study the low transverse momentum distribution of drell - yan type of processes in hadronic collisions from fixed target experiments to highest collider energy experiments , such as the tevatron at fermilab and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , see , for example , the relevant publications in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the resummation for the hard processes are based on the tmd factorization for these processes  @xcite .",
    "since the definition of the tmds contains the light - cone singularity  @xcite , the detailed calculations depend on the scheme to regulate this singularity . in the original paper of collins - soper",
    "@xcite , an axial gauge has been used .",
    "this was followed by a gauge invariant approach in ji - ma - yuan with a slight off - light - cone gauge link in covariant gauge  @xcite ( referred as ji - ma - yuan scheme in the following ) . a new definition for the tmd and the associated soft factor has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite where a subtraction method was used to regulate the light - cone singularity ( referred as collins-11 in the following ) , and the phenomenological applications were presented in refs .  @xcite .",
    "although the tmds depend on the regularization scheme , the resummation for the physical observables , such as the differential cross sections and the spin asymmetries , is independent on the scheme .",
    "we will present detailed discussions in the below between the two formalisms of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite .    to understand the energy evolution of the spin - dependent hard processes , such as the ssa in sidis and drell - yan lepton pair production , we need to extend the cs and css derivation to the interested observables  @xcite .",
    "the cs evolution equations for the tmds was extensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the evolution kernel was derived for all the leading order tmd quark distributions . in particular , for the so - called @xmath10-even tmds , the evolution is exactly the same as the original cs evolution . for the @xmath10-odd ones , a slightly different form has to be used , but with the same kernel .",
    "these evolution equations can be cross checked with the finite order perturbative calculations , which has been shown to yield consistent results  @xcite .    besides the above developments in the investigation of the tmds in full qcd , recently",
    "an effective theory approach based on the soft - collinear - effective - theory has been applied to the evolution of the tmds .",
    "several different schemes are proposed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that one of the effective theory approach  @xcite ( referred as eis in the following ) is equivalent to the collins-11 formalism  @xcite .",
    "although there are different ways to formulate the tmd distribution and fragmentation functions , the energy evolution and resummation for the physical observables ( including the differential cross sections and spin asymmetries ) will always take the same form as they should be .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will focus on the energy evolution for the differential cross section and spin asymmetries .",
    "of course , to have a solid prediction for the physical observables , we need to have the tmd factorization proven for the relevant processes .",
    "the sidis and drell - yan lepton pair production in @xmath0 collisions are two examples that a rigorous tmd factorization has been proven .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to make predictions for the sivers single spin asymmetries in drell - yan lepton pair production in @xmath0 collisions from the constraints from the sivers asymmetries observed in sidis from hermes / compass experiments .",
    "the tmd factorization and universality has predicted that the sivers asymmetries in these two processes differ by a sign , because of difference between the initial / final state interaction  @xcite .",
    "the sivers single spin asymmetries in sidis have been observed by hermes / compass / jlab hall a collaborations with @xmath2 at the region from 2 to 4 gev@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "however , the typical drell - yan measurements will be around the region from @xmath11 to @xmath12 gev@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the energy evolution of the associated tmds is important to carry out a rigorous test of the sign change prediction .",
    "early calculations are based on the tmd factorization , however , without the energy evolution effects in the derivation  @xcite . recently",
    ", several studies have started to take into account the evolution effects  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a strong decreasing was found in comparing the ssa in typical drell - yan processes to those observed by hermes / compass . in this paper",
    ", we will carefully examine these predictions , and present a consistent calculation for the energy evolution in both spin - average and single - spin dependent cross sections .",
    "a brief summary has been published earlier  @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our calculations is to build the correct evolution framework which can describe the known experimental data of the unpolarized cross sections in the associated processes .",
    "one has to test the tmd evolution with the unpolarized cross sections before they can be applied to spin - dependent cross sections and the spin asymmetries .",
    "this is a very important point , which , unfortunately , is often forgotten in the phenomenological studies .",
    "we will make use of the successful approach in the css resummation . in these formulations ,",
    "a non - perturbative form factor has to be included .",
    "we follow the blny and kn calculations  @xcite , where @xmath4-prescription of css resummation is applied : @xmath13 with @xmath14 the impact parameter .",
    "this prescription guarantees that @xmath15 .",
    "the non - perturbative form factor takes a form as @xmath16 in the impact parameter space with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the longitudinal momentum fractions of the incoming nucleons carried by the initial state quark and antiquark .",
    "the parametrization was fitted to the typical drell - yan lepton pair production with @xmath19 and @xmath20 production ( @xmath21 ) . by applying the universality argument",
    ", these parameterizations should be able to apply in the sidis processes for the associated quark distribution part .",
    "however , if we extrapolate the above parameterization down to the typical hermes / compass kinematics where @xmath2 is around @xmath22 , we can not describe the transverse momentum distribution of hadron production in these experiments ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "the main reason is that the logarithmic dependence leads to a strong change around low @xmath2 , which , however , contradicts with the smooth dependence from the experimental observation .",
    "it will be interesting to check other forms of non - perturative form factors to see if they can be extrapolated to hermes / compass energy region  @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this issue in a future publication .     from 4 to 10 : left , apply the tmd evolution directly from @xmath23 to @xmath1 ; right , apply css resummation with integral from @xmath4 to @xmath1 .",
    "the connections between the two evolutions are the tmd sivers functions and their transverse - momentum moments . in the overlap region , both shall yield consistent results for the asymmetries.,width=340 ]    meanwhile , for moderate @xmath2 variation , there is an alternative approach to apply , from which we can directly solve the evolution by an integral of the kernel from low to high @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this is , in particular , useful at relative low @xmath1 region , and can be applied to describe the transverse momentum distributions in sidis from hermes / compass experiments and fixed target drell - yan lepton pair production experiments  @xcite .",
    "this will also help to build a connection to the ultimate css resummation in drell - yan and @xmath20 production . as illustrated in fig .  1",
    ", in the moderate @xmath1 region ( including hermes / compass kinematics of sidis and drell - yan process in fixed target experiments ) , we apply the evolution by a direct integral of the kernel from relative low @xmath1 to relative high @xmath1 . in the high @xmath1 region which covers drell - yan lepton pair production and @xmath20 production ,",
    "we apply the complete css resummation with @xmath4-prescription ( following blny / kn parameterization of the non - perturbative form factors ) . in the overlap region",
    ", we shall obtain a consistent picture for the transverse momentum distribution of the cross section and the spin asymmetries .    following this procedure",
    ", we will determine the quark sivers functions from the hermes / compass experiments in sidis with @xmath2-evolution taken into account using direct integral of the kernel .",
    "in particular , we constrain the transverse momentum moments of the quark sivers functions , which correspond to the twist - three quark - gluon - quark correlation functions ( so - called qiu - sterman matrix elements  @xcite ) .",
    "these are the bases to evaluate the sivers single spin asymmetries in the css resummation formalism  @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the sivers asymmetries in drell - yan processes with the constrained sivers functions .",
    "the consistent check is carried out by comparing the predictions between the evolutions done with direct integral of the kernel from @xmath24 to @xmath1 and that with css resummation with integral of the kernel from @xmath25 to @xmath1 .",
    "we notice that in the original blny parameterization , there is a strong @xmath26-dependence ( which is correlated to the @xmath2-dependence ) in the non - perturbative form factor  @xcite . to avoid this strong dependence ,",
    "we follow an updated fit by konychev and nadolsky  @xcite which describes equally well the drell - yan and w / z boson data with a mild dependence on @xmath26 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the sivers asymmetries observed in hermes / compass experiments mainly focus on the moderate @xmath26-region around 0.1 , which is also the typical @xmath26-range for the drell - yan fixed target experiments  .",
    "this will be important to check the @xmath26-dependence of the non - perturbative form factor .",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we present a brief review on the theory of low transverse momentum hard processes as a self - contained introduction .",

    "vi , we summarize our paper , and discuss further developments .",
    "in this section , we present a brief review of the theory background for low transverse momentum hard processes . under the context of this paper ,",
    "the hard processes are hadronic processes with two separate scales : the invariant mass of virtual photon @xmath1 and the transverse momentum of observed particles @xmath7 for lepton pair in drell - yan process or @xmath28 for final state hadron in sidis .",
    "tmd factorization applies in the kinematic region of low transverse momentum : @xmath29 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , large double logarithms will arise from perturbative gluon radiation .",
    "these large logs have been demonstrated in the single transverse spin dependent differential cross sections as well  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will summarize these calculations , and , in particular , present detailed derivations of our previous publication  @xcite .",
    "we will start with the low transverse momentum drell - yan lepton pair productions for both spin averaged and spin - dependent cross sections .",

    ", we have @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the momenta of hadrons @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for the transverse polarization vector of @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "we further assume hadron @xmath33 moving in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "light - cone momentum @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , @xmath31 is dominated by its plus component , whereas @xmath32 by its minus component .",
    "the single transverse spin dependent differential cross section can be expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath7 and @xmath40 are transverse momentum and rapidity of the lepton pair , @xmath41 with @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 . when @xmath29 , the structure function @xmath45 can be formulated in terms of the tmd factorization where the quark sivers function is involved  @xcite , whereas when @xmath46 it can be calculated in the collinear factorization approach in terms of the twist - three quark - gluon - quark correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the tmd and collinear twist - three approaches give the consistent results in the intermediate transverse momentum region : @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "this consistency allows us to separate @xmath45 into two terms  @xcite , @xmath48 where the first term dominates in the @xmath29 region , while the second term dominates in the region of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the latter is obtained by subtracting the the leading term of @xmath51 from the full perturbative calculation . in this paper , we focus on the low transverse momentum region , where a tmd factorization is appropriate",
    ". we will review how perturbative corrections modify the differential cross sections , in particular , from the large logarithms in fixed order calculations .",
    "the results for @xmath52 up to one - loop corrections will be shown .      to study the qcd dynamics , in particular , to understand the scale evolution of the tmds , it is illustrative to have a perturbative calculation for the above quantities at small @xmath53 limit",

    "we extend this approach to the sivers single spin asymmetries in sidis process , and perform a combined fit to the hermes / compass data with the tmd evolution effects .",

    "we need future experiments to pin down both down quark sivers function and sea quark sivers functions . as we mentioned above , sidis measurements in the 12 gev upgrade of jlab and the planed electron - ion collider experiments , plus the drell - yan experiments which we will discuss in the following section , shall help us to achieve these goals .",
    "quark sivers functions have been phenomenologically constrained from hermes / compass experiments by several groups in the literature  @xcite . in the following , we briefly comment on the comparisons with these studies .",

    "@xcite might need to be re - examined .    by comparing with previous constraints on the quark sivers function , we notice an interesting aspect :",
    "our results agree roughly with the fits done without the tmd evolution effects .",
    "this comes from the fact that the hermes and compass experiments do not differ much on @xmath2 , and the evolution effects from our calculation is not so strong as naively expected .",
    "certainly , more theoretical studies are needed to check the evolution effects .    as we emphasized above , in this paper ,",

    "there are additional theoretical uncertainties from the tmd evolution , which has only be tested for moderate @xmath26 range as we showed in the last section .",
    "therefore , the constraints for small-@xmath26 region quark sivers function have to be taken a particular caution .",
    "in this section , we present the predictions on the sivers single spin asymmetries in drell - yan lepton pair production and w / z boson production in polarized @xmath0 collisions .",
    "these predictions not only serve as important base lines for the sign change tests of the sivers asymmetry in these experimental proposals , but also provide guidelines for precision measurement of the tmd quark sivers functions . in particular , the combination of different kinematic coverages in these experiments shall help to identify down quark and sea quark sivers functions beyond what we can extract from the current hermes / compass experiments . therefore , in the following",

    "one is the flavor dependence , i.e. , how precise the quark sivers functions can be determined from the sidis experiments from hermes / compass collaborations .",
    "another important issue is the energy dependence of these observables .",

    "we have to understand the energy evolution of the sivers spin asymmetries before we can make precise predictions .",
    "the last few sections of this paper are dedicated to understand correctly the energy evolution of the hard processes in sidis and drell - yan lepton pair productions , including the unpolarized cross sections , and the sivers single spin asymmetries .",
    "our strategy has always been to test the evolution for the unpolarized cross sections before we can apply to the spin - dependent observables .",
    "we have been able to show that the energy evolution equations we used can successfully describe the transverse momentum distributions in sidis from hermes / compass experiments and drell - yan lepton pair production in fixed target experiments .",
    "hermes / compass experiments are where we observed the sivers single spin asymmetries , whereas the drell - yan processes in our study are close to the kinematics of future proposed experiments to measure the sivers single spin asymmetries .",
    "most importantly , all these experiments ( including sidis from hermes / compass and drell - yan in fixed target experiments ) cover similar range of @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we do not have to worry too much on additional complication involving @xmath26-dependence in the non - perturbative form factors in the tmd evolutions .",
    "let us briefly summarize our procedure to predict the ssas in the drell - yan processes .",
    "we will mainly use the css resummation formalism in terms of the collinear parton distribution and correlation functions .",
    "the sivers asymmetries depend on the transverse - momentum moments of the quark sivers functions in the css resummation formula , which we will use the parameterization we extracted from the combined fit of the hermes and compass data from the last section .",
    "the non - perturbative form factors will follow those in konychev - nadolsky result , which are fitted to unpolarized drell - yan and w / z boson production data .",
    "for the single spin dependent cross sections , the difference in the non - perturbative form factor @xmath268 was also fitted to the hermes / compass data .",
    "since the @xmath1-dependence of the non - perturbative form factors are the same for the spin - average and single - spin dependent cross sections ( they obey the same evolution equation ) , this difference will not depend on @xmath1 .",
    "the fitted @xmath268 will be applied to the ssas in drell - yan and w / z production processes .",

    "the tmd evolution of sun - yuan approach predicts smaller ssas than that from the css resummation formalism with the two implementations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "this comes from the gaussian assumption of the tmds at lower scale @xmath24 which leads to more suppression of the spin asymmetry at moderate transverse momentum .",
    "however , with the css resummation correcting behavior for the transverse momentum distribution , this can be improved .",
    "another point is the evolution of @xmath62 ( implementation ( 2 ) ) increases the asymmetry predictions than that without @xmath62 evolution .",
    "this is because for fixed scale , we have used @xmath303 , whereas at moderate transverse momentum the scale for @xmath62 in ( 2 ) is around @xmath314 , and is smaller than @xmath24 .",
    "this will lead to larger @xmath62 contribution to the sivers single spin asymmetries .",
    "this difference highlight the opportunities to study the qcd dynamics in this transverse momentum region , because it is sensitive to the qcd evolution .",
    "we hope in the future the sivers single spin asymmetries can be measured in drell - yan process in the relative high transverse momentum region .",
    "these two plots demonstrate that we do have a consistent picture for the sivers single spin asymmetries in the drell - yan lepton pair production in the mass region of interest in the fixed target experiments .",
    "one approach ( sun - yuan ) uses the tmd evolution from sidis of hermes / compass to drell - yan processes ; one approach uses the resummation formulas only for drell - yan processes but with the collinear correlation functions ( transverse - momentum moments ) extracted from hermes / compass experiments .",
    "the agreement between these two calculations shows that we understand the energy evolution effects on the sivers single spin asymmetries .",
    "in particular , the size and slope of the ssas calculated from the above formulas in the low transverse momentum region agree with each other . this region is mainly determined by the ratio between the quark sivers function and unpolarized quark distribution .",
    "the agreements indicate that the identification of @xmath315 with @xmath316 is appropriate for the sivers single spin asymmetry calculations .",
    "of course , the difference in the relative high transverse momentum region will introduce additional theoretical uncertainties . from fig .  [",

    ", we will present the predictions with the css formalism and kn non - perturbative form factors .",
    "this approach does better job for moderate transverse momentum .",
    "in addition , it is the only approach that would predict correctly the cross section and spin asymmetries for w / z production at rhic .",
    "we would like to add one more comment . from the analysis of the last section , we know that the uncertainties of the extracted quark sivers functions from the hermes / compass experiments is not negligible .",
    "therefore , in the following calculations , we will present the predictions with the standard one sigma uncertainty estimate for the sivers single spin asymmetries in the drell - yan processes .",

    "the average @xmath2 from the experimental simulation has been used in the calculations of the sivers single spin asymmetries .",
    "an important feature of this experiment is that the incoming @xmath253 is dominated by @xmath323 and @xmath324 quarks from the pion , which leads to the dominant contribution from the up quark sivers functions .",
    "the up quark sivers function is constrained by the hermes / compass experiments .",

    "clearly , this experiment will mostly cover the valence region of the polarized proton , @xmath328 , which is beyond the current hermes / compass measurements .",
    "our predictions come from the extrapolation of the function form constrained by the hermes / compass experiments .",
    "the measurements of this asymmetry in the proposed experiment shall , for the first time , investigate the sivers asymmetries in this kinematic region .    on the other hand , for target polarization , because @xmath17 is still around valence region and the quark distribution",

    "therefore , the observation of this asymmetry will tell us on the sea quark polarization .",
    "we would like to emphasize that for @xmath20 boson production , the tmd evolution directly from low scale can not describe the @xmath27 spectrum . for this",
    ", we have to use css resummation .",
    "the main reason is that the perturbative gluon radiation dominates the low transverse momentum @xmath20 production , whereas the low scale tmd is not easy to generate these contributions .",
    "it may be improved by taking into account perturbative tail in the tmd quark distribution at low @xmath1 scale .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the tmd evolution effects on semi - inclusive dis and low transverse momentum drell - yan lepton pair production in @xmath0 collisions , consistently describing both unpolarized and single transverse spin sivers asymmetries .",
    "in particular , we have built up a framework to match sidis and drell - yan , which can cover the tmd physics with @xmath2 from 2 @xmath333 to @xmath334 ( for w / z boson production ) . by doing so , we constrained the transverse - momentum moments of the quark sivers functions from the combined analysis of the hermes / compass data on the sivers single spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive hadron production in dis process with the tmd evolution for the spin - average and single - spin dependent differential cross sections .",
    "the tmd evolution was carefully examined against the transverse momentum distribution of unpolarized sidis and drell - yan processes in the @xmath2 range from 2 to 100 @xmath333 .",
    "our approach agrees well with the existing experimental data .",
    "most importantly , we have demonstrated the matching between our evolution calculation with the well - established css resummation formalism with @xmath4-prescription and the kn parameterization of the non - perturbative form factors , for the spin - averaged cross sections , as well as the sivers single spin asymmetries , in drell - yan lepton pair production in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "this shows that our calculations are consistent within sidis from hermes / compass and drell - yan lepton pair production .",
    "future experiments will provide important cross checks of our results .",
    "a number of improvements shall follow .",
    "first , for the drell - yan lepton pair production , we shall include the dglap evolution in the css resummation , although the effects is not so large for low to moderate transverse momentum region . as we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : match ] , in the relative high transverse momentum region , the dglap evolution is evident , and shall be able to distinguish different dynamics in the tmd evolution .",
    "hope we will have precise experimental data in the future , which will provide unique opportunity to study the associated dynamics .",
    "second , our approach builds connection between relative low @xmath1 hard processes to those with high @xmath2 ( up to @xmath20 production ) : low @xmath1 with direct integral of the evolution kernel ; high @xmath1 with css resummation with @xmath4 prescription",
    ". it will be nice to have a single framework to calculate both unpolarized and spin - dependent cross sections . to do that",
    ", we have to modify the current assumption on the non - perturbative form factors used in the literature .",
    "this will need additional research effort .",
    "we will come back to this issue later .",
    "third , in this paper , we only focused on the moderate @xmath26 range , where the @xmath26-dependence in the non - perturbative form factors in the css resummation is not so evident . in the future",
    ", we shall extend the studies to the small-@xmath26 region as well .",
    "for this , the hera experiments have published data on sidis processes , and shall be taken into account for a global analysis .",
    "in addition , the tmd evolutions we derived for the spin - averaged and spin - dependent cross sections can serve as guidelines for future theoretical developments . an immediate extension is to analyze the collins asymmetries in sidis and di - hadron production in @xmath335 annihilations .",

    "<S> we examine the qcd evolution for the transverse momentum dependent observables in hard processes of semi - inclusive hadron production in deep inelastic scattering and drell - yan lepton pair production in @xmath0 collisions , including the spin - average cross sections and sivers single transverse spin asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the evolution equations derived by a direct integral of the collins - soper - sterman evolution kernel from low to high @xmath1 can describe well the transverse momentum distribution of the unpolarized cross sections in the @xmath2 range from 2 to 100 gev@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the matching is established between our evolution and the collins - soper - sterman resummation with @xmath4-prescription and konychev - nodalsky parameterization of the non - perturbative form factors , which are formulated to describe the drell - yan lepton pair and w / z boson production in hadronic collisions . with these results , </S>",
    "<S> we present the predictions for the sivers single transverse spin asymmetries in drell - yan lepton pair production and @xmath5 boson production in polarized @xmath0 and @xmath6 collisions for several proposed experiments . we emphasize that these experiments will not only provide crucial test of the sign change of the sivers asymmetry , but also provide important opportunities to study the qcd evolution effects . </S>"
