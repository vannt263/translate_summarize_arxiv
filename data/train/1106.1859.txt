    "the big bang scenario implies that in the first micro - seconds of the universe the entire state has emerged from a partonic system of quarks , antiquarks and gluons  a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  to color neutral hadronic matter consisting of interacting hadronic states ( and resonances ) in which the partonic degrees of freedom are confined .",
    "the nature of confinement and the dynamics of this phase transition has motivated a large community for several decades and is still an outstanding question of todays physics .",
    "early concepts of the qgp were guided by the idea of a weakly interacting system of partons which might be described by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "however , experimental observations at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) indicated that the new medium created in ultrarelativistic au+au collisions is interacting more strongly than hadronic matter and consequently this concept had to be severely questioned .",
    "moreover , in line with theoretical studies in refs .",
    "@xcite the medium showed phenomena of an almost perfect liquid of partons  @xcite as extracted from the strong radial expansion and the scaling of elliptic flow @xmath0 of mesons and baryons with the number of constituent quarks and antiquarks  @xcite .",
    "the question about the properties of this ( nonperturbative ) qgp liquid is discussed controversially in the literature and dynamical concepts describing the formation of color neutral hadrons from colored partons are scarce .",
    "a fundamental issue for hadronization models is the conservation of 4-momentum as well as the entropy problem because by fusion / coalescence of massless ( or low constituent mass ) partons to color neutral bound states of low invariant mass ( e.g. pions ) the number of degrees of freedom and thus the total entropy is reduced in the hadronization process  @xcite .",
    "this problem - a violation of the second law of thermodynamics as well as the conservation of four - momentum and flavor currents - has been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the dqpm employing covariant transition rates for the fusion of massive quarks and antiquarks to color neutral hadronic resonances or strings .",
    "in fact , the dynamical studies for an expanding partonic fireball in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that the latter problems have come to a practical solution .",
    "a consistent dynamical approach - valid also for strongly interacting systems - can be formulated on the basis of kadanoff - baym ( kb ) equations  @xcite or off - shell transport equations in phase - space representation , respectively  @xcite . in the kb theory",
    "the field quanta are described in terms of dressed propagators with complex selfenergies . whereas the real part of the selfenergies can be related to mean - field potentials ( of lorentz scalar , vector or tensor type ) , the imaginary parts provide information about the lifetime and/or reaction rates of time - like particles  @xcite .",

    "we note that the expression  ( [ dover ] ) corresponds to the limit of independent harmonic oscillator states and that the final hadron - formation rates are approximately independent of the parameter @xmath20 within reasonable variations . by construction",

    "hadrons of higher masses ( @xmath32 1.5 gev in case of baryons and @xmath32 1.3 gev in case of mesons ) are treated as strings ( color - dipoles ) that decay to the known ( low - mass ) hadrons according to the jetset algorithm  @xcite .",

    "the slope of the @xmath33 spectra is only slightly enhanced in phsd relative to hsd which demonstrates that the pion transverse motion shows no sizeable sensitivity to the partonic phase .",
    "however , the @xmath37 transverse mass spectra are substantially hardened with respect to the hsd calculations at all bombarding energies - i.e. phsd is more in line with the data - and thus suggests that partonic effects are better visible in the strangeness - degrees of freedom .",
    "the hardening of the kaon spectra can be traced back to parton - parton scattering as well as a larger collective acceleration of the partons in the transverse direction due to the presence of repulsive vector fields for the partons .",
    "the enhancement of the spectral slope for kaons and antikaons in phsd due to collective partonic flow shows up much clearer for the kaons due to their significantly larger mass ( relative to pions ) .",

    "@xcite the underestimation of the @xmath37 slope by hsd ( and also urqmd ) had been suggested to be a signature for missing partonic degrees of freedom ; the present phsd calculations support this early suggestion .",

    "the latter result suggests that the partonic phase does not show up explicitly in an enhanced production of strangeness ( or in particular strange mesons and baryons ) but leads to a different redistribution of antistrange quarks between mesons and antibaryons .",
