    "understanding how information is stored in a quantum system and how it can be extracted is one of the main goals of quantum information science .",
    "because quantum mechanics is often counter - intuitive , this goal is as challenging as it is promising .",
    "historically , the existence of quantum superpositions and the interference they imply were the first aspects of quantum mechanics that confronted our intuition . when we considered measurements of an individual spin @xmath0 in the vertical direction , the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 were easy to interpret classically",
    "however , superposition of states like @xmath3 were puzzling and the statistical interpretation on a lot of copies was the only resort . nowadays , this superposition is seen just as classical as the _ up _ and _ down _ states .",
    "we just rename it @xmath4 and consider that it only makes sense to measure it in the horizontal @xmath5 direction .",
    "performing the measurement in the vertical direction is possible , but it will not give any information at all .",
    "it will disturb the system so much that it will be brought in as one of the  vertical \" states with perfect probability .",
    "then quantum entanglement came into the play @xcite and challenged our intuition even more .",
    "the essence of entanglement is well summarized by considering the so - called _",
    "bipartite entanglement_. such kinds of entanglement states that the information about a quantum system is not only encoded exclusively in its parts , but it is also encoded in the correlations between the parts .",
    "remarkably , when a bipartite quantum system is maximally entangled , the information appears to be fully encoded in these correlations and no longer in the system s constituents . because the different parts of a whole system are located at different spatial positions , bipartite entanglement contradicts local realism .",
    "bipartite entanglement is well understood nowadays .",
    "next comes the question of entanglement when the number of parties is bigger than two , the so called _ multipartite entanglement _ . without any surprises ,",
    "multipartite entanglement is much richer than bipartite entanglement , and thus more difficult to understand @xcite .",
    "it leads to stronger contradictions with local realism than bipartite entanglement @xcite and several inequivalent classes of entangled states exist as soon as three qubits are considered @xcite .",
    "multipartite entanglement is also central in several applications like one - way quantum computing @xcite .",
    "its dynamics has revealed a surprisingly large variety of flavors when exposed to a dissipative environment @xcite .",
    "recently , a lot of work has focused on particular kinds of qubit states , totally invariant under permutation of their qubits .",
    "this kind of state is really interesting because they are analytically tractable and easy to work with numerically .",
    "they exhibit high entanglement content , especially in terms of their geometric entanglement @xcite , non - local behavior @xcite , convenient representation @xcite and involvement in experimental setups @xcite .",
    "however , in some aspects , the power of the permutational symmetry is also a weakness .",
    "it is a strongly constraining symmetry that a lot of interesting quantum states do not satisfy for more than three qubits , particularly the states that are known for their high entanglement content relative to different kinds of measures @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it is also demonstrated that a symmetric state of qubits can not have its reduced states all maximally mixed , except in the case where those reduced states are the smallest possible , i.e. , with only one qubit each . for symmetric states , reduced states formed with a pair , triplet , and etc .",
    "will never be all maximally mixed . that is surprising because in a given hilbert space it is always possible to find states with all their reductions that keep about 18% of the total number of qubits maximally mixed @xcite . in the context of quantum error correction , such states are therefore robust to the loss of about 18% of their qubits because they do not encode information .    for these reasons , it is then quite natural to explore beyond the perfect permutational symmetry by still capturing some of its aspects that make it so convenient .",
    "to get some intuition on how to do such a thing , let us consider two qubits seen as two spins @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that arbitrary states of such a system are linear combinations of the symmetric components ( formed with the three triplets ) and an antisymmetric component ( formed with the singlet ) . for more than two qubits ,",
    "the situation becomes richer because a given qubit can have a symmetric relationship with some qubits and an antisymmetric relationship with some others .",
    "a 3-qubit state will decompose in different parts : one part will be indeed a totally symmetric part completely invariant by any permutation of its quits . then",
    ", another part will have symmetry between qubits 1 and 2 but antisymmetry between 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 .",
    "in the same vein , an other part will have antisymmetry between 1 and 2 but symmetry between 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 .",
    "obviously , there will be four other parts corresponding to the four other ways to fix the symmetries between the qubits .",
    "note that , however , it will not contain a completely antisymmetric part because it is impossible to antisymmetrize more than two qubits .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study quantum states that have these kinds of intermediate symmetries that lie in between the perfect symmetric and antisymmetric ones .",
    "those symmetries will be described thanks to the formalism of the representations of the symmetric group .",
    "the layout of this paper is the following : sec .",
    "ii introduces important notions about the symmetric group and its representations and rigorously defines the intermediate symmetries . in sec .",
    "iii , a measure of the amount of intermediate symmetries contained in a quantum state is introduced .",
    "then , all the moments and the probability distribution of that measure are calculated analytically for random states of qubits and confronted with numerical simulation .",
    "this statistical analysis shows that the maximal antisymmetry is a generic feature of random quantum states . in sec .",
    "iv , some relationships between quantum states with intermediate symmetries and entanglement are considered .",
    "a natural extension of the majorana representation @xcite is introduced and some numerical calculations are presented . at the end of the section ,",
    "a theorem is derived showing that the most antisymmetric states are a special kind of maximally entangled states in the sense that no information is contained in their individual qubits . in other words ,",
    "those states are quantum error correcting codes robust against any 1-qubit errors .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in sec . v.",
    "in this part , we will introduce the mathematical background that is going to be used throughout this article .",
    "the minimum amount of required concepts and notations will be described briefly and relevant formulas will be written without demonstration .",
    "a more rigorous approach with more details can be found in many reference books concerning the symmetric group and its representations @xcite .",
    "the symmetric group of @xmath6 elements , noted @xmath7 , is the set of permutations of those elements where the composition of permutations plays the role of the group multiplication .",
    "there are @xmath8 such permutations .",
    "some of these permutations are called _ cycles _ because they exchange the elements of a subset in a circular fashion .",
    "the number of elements that are permuted in a given cycle is called the _ length _ of the cycle . for instance , the permutation that transforms the string @xmath9 to the string @xmath10 can be seen as a cycle on the subset @xmath11 in the sense that 1 goes to position 2 , 2 goes to position 3 and 3 goes to position 1 . at the same time ,",
    "4 and 5 keep their position .",
    "therefore , it is a cycle of length 3 or similarly a 3-cycle .",
    "cycles can be written in _ cycle notation _ where the elements are written in between parentheses such that the first element in the parentheses goes to the position of the second , the second goes to the position of the third one , and so on until the last element takes the position of the first one . like this",
    ", the previous permutation is written @xmath12 .",
    "what makes cycles interesting is that any permutation can be constructed as a combination of disjoint cycles .",
    "the permutation that transforms the string @xmath9 to the string @xmath13 can be seen as two cycles , one on the subset @xmath11 and one on the subset @xmath14 , written @xmath15 .",
    "note that , in the cycle notation , elements that do not change position , i.e. , cycles of size one , are omitted .",
    "that is why the permutation considered above that could be written @xmath16 is simply written to @xmath12 .",
    "two permutations are said to have the same cycle structure if they are constructed thanks to cycles with identical lengths .",
    "for instance , the permutation @xmath17 and @xmath18 are a combination of a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle .",
    "there is an interesting fact concerning the symmetric group .",
    "its irreducible representations are in direct correspondence with its conjugacy classes .",
    "moreover , it is possible to show that permutations that belong to the same conjugacy class have the same cycle structure .",
    "therefore , each irreducible representation can be labeled by a quantity which reminds the cycle structure , that is to say a partition @xmath19 of the number of elements @xmath6 , noted @xmath20 .",
    "a partition @xmath19 can be written thanks to a _",
    "partition vector _ , which is a vector with monotonic decreasing entries that sums to @xmath6 , @xmath21 another way to represent a partition @xmath19 can be done thanks to a _ young diagram _ , a diagram that is constructed by gluing together rows of @xmath22 square boxes from top to bottom , for @xmath23 in @xmath24 $ ] . as an example for @xmath25 , all the partition vectors and their corresponding young diagrams",
    "are given by @xmath26 partitions are listed here in the _ inverse lexicographical order _ , which means that @xmath27 , if and only if the first non - zero difference @xmath28 for @xmath23 in @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the position of a partition with respect to this ordering will be used in some formulas by simply writing it @xmath19 , the context preventing any risk for confusion . like this , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    from partitions and young diagrams ,",
    "several relevant quantities need to be defined . the multiplicity of @xmath23 of a partition @xmath19 shorthanded with an exponent index as @xmath31 counts the number of times the value @xmath23 appears in a partition .",
    "for instance , if @xmath32 , then @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the _ hooks _ of a box in a given young diagram is defined as the set of boxes that are below and to the right of the box , including the considered box itself .",
    "the _ hook - length _ of a given box is simply the total number of boxes in its hook . as an example , here are all the young diagrams for @xmath25 with the values of the hook - length of each box : @xmath35    note that we will denote partitions relative to the irreducible representations of the symmetric group with greek indices starting at the letter @xmath19 .",
    "greek indices starting at the letter @xmath36 will be used to represent a given conjugacy class . by extension , any permutations that belong to the same conjugacy class will also be written @xmath36 .",
    "it is then useful to evaluate the number of permutation in the class @xmath36 as @xmath37    the character of the permutation @xmath38 in the representation @xmath19 noted @xmath39 is a number defined as the trace of the matrix of the permutation @xmath38 in the representation @xmath19 .",
    "it forms a _ class function _ in the sense that it has the same value for all the permutations that belong to the same conjugacy class .",
    "for that reason , it is common to only consider the values of the character written @xmath40 associated with the conjugacy class @xmath36 and arrange them together in the matrix with element @xmath41 , called the _",
    "character table_. in the appendix , the so - called frobenius formula is presented , which allows us to calculate all those characters .",
    "characters satisfy the two following orthogonality relations : @xmath42      the central concept of this article is called the schur - weyl duality .",
    "it states that the finite dimension hilbert space of @xmath6 qudits @xmath43 decomposes as a direct sum of orthogonal subspaces @xmath44 , @xmath45 each @xmath44 is constructed as the tensor product of the irreducible representation of the special unitary group su@xmath46 and the irreducible representation of the symmetric group @xmath7 , both labeled by the partition @xmath19 .",
    "the dimension @xmath47 of the irreducible representations of su@xmath46 happens to be inversely proportional to the product of all the hook - lengths of @xmath19 noted @xmath48 , @xmath49 the dimension @xmath50 of the irreducible representation of the symmetric group @xmath7 can be obtained thanks to the following formula applied to the partition vector @xmath19 : @xmath51 the dimension @xmath52 of each @xmath44 is therefore given by the product @xmath53 and it clearly satisfies @xmath54 .",
    "to get some intuition about the structure of the subspaces @xmath55 , it is necessary to understand how the states they contain are constructed .",
    "basically , the states of a possible basis for @xmath55 are built by symmetrizing and antisymmetrizing the states of the computational basis following the pattern given by the young diagram @xmath19 : each row will correspond to a symmetrization and each column will correspond to an antisymmetrization . to visualize the states that spanned @xmath55 ,",
    "it is helpful to take each state of the computational basis state , write their arguments as binary indices in the young diagram , and rearrange the indices according to all the possible permutations . because of the antisymmetrization , the only states that are going to contribute are the ones leading to permutations of the filled young diagram with each column containing distinct values .",
    "for instance , the subspace labeled by the diagram @xmath56 will not be spanned by the state @xmath57 .",
    "clearly there is no permutation of @xmath58 that satisfies the column constrain .",
    "on the other hand , the states @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 will span the subspace because they can be rearranged in the form @xmath62 compatible with the antisymmetrization . as a consequence of such a construction ,",
    "it is impossible to antisymmetrize more than @xmath63 qudits . therefore , the subspaces labeled by the young tables that contains columns with more than @xmath63 boxes are zero dimensional .",
    "to make such a construction more systematic , it is convenient to introduce the set of projectors @xmath64 on each @xmath44 .",
    "they can be constructed as @xmath65 @xmath66 is the unitary operator that maps the permutation @xmath38 in the hilbert space .",
    "its matrix elements are given by @xmath67 where @xmath23 and @xmath68 are @xmath6 entries @xmath63-valued vectors that index the computational basis . by definition , @xmath69 and from eq .",
    "( [ chi1 ] ) , it is straightforward to verify that the projectors @xmath70 form a set of orthogonal projectors such that @xmath71 from each @xmath64 , an orthonormal basis for each @xmath44 can be built by applying a gram  schmidt process to the set of linear independent columns @xmath72 . such a basis will be noted @xmath73 with vectors @xmath74 , for @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "note that the basis @xmath76 of the complete symmetric situation are nothing other that the dicke states @xcite and the other basis vector can be seen as their generalization .      to see how the previous formalism works , let us consider the 2-qubit case .",
    "the parameters are thus @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the integer @xmath79 can be decomposed as @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the hilbert space decomposes in two subspaces as @xmath82 to construct the projectors @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we first need to express all the relevant quantities concerning @xmath85 .",
    "this group contains only two elements : the identity element written @xmath86 and the transposition @xmath87 .",
    "the corresponding unitary operators can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ p2u ] ) as @xmath88 simply being the identity operator and @xmath89 being nothing other than the swap operator . in matrix form @xmath90 the character table of @xmath85 can be calculated for instance thanks to the frobenius formula ( see the appendix ) @xmath91 and from the definition of the hook - length , one can calculate that @xmath92 .",
    "equation ( [ proj ] ) gives the projectors @xmath93 taking the traces of the operators gives the dimension of the subspaces @xmath94 the three linear independent columns of @xmath83 and the only distinct columns of @xmath84 already form an orthogonal basis .",
    "after normalization we obtain the basis @xmath95    such a decomposition is quite natural in the context of 1/2 spins . @xmath96 corresponds to the _ symmetric subspace _ and its basis states are the triplet states .",
    "@xmath97 corresponds to the _ antisymmetric subspace _ that contains the unique singlet states .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this subspace is maximally entangled because the singlet states is a bell state .",
    "when the number of qudits is bigger , arbitrary partitions lead to _ intermediate symmetry_. those intermediate symmetries mean that a given qudit will be symmetrized with respect to a group of qubits and antisymmetrized with another group . to be more precise , a given intermediate symmetry",
