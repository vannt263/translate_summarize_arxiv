    "traders or asset managers willing to sell blocks of shares are increasingly using execution algorithms . amongst the strategies proposed by brokers , the most widely studied from an academic point of view is the implementation shortfall ( is ) strategy . the classical modeling framework for optimal liquidation , developed by almgren and chriss in their seminal papers @xcite , is indeed focused on is orders benchmarked on the arrival price , that is the price at the beginning of the liquidation process . in the case of is orders , the agent faces a trade - off between selling slowly to reduce execution costs and selling rapidly to limit the influence of price fluctuations .",
    "although almost all the literature on optimal liquidation deals with is orders , is algorithms usually account for less volume than vwap ( volume weighted average price ) algorithms ",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "the aim of traders when they choose vwap orders is to focus on the reduction of execution costs : the order is split into smaller ones and the associated transactions occur on a pre - determined period to obtain a price as close as possible to the average price over this period ( weighted by market volume ) .",
    "vwap is also a neutral and rather fair benchmark to evaluate execution processes .",
    "many agents are willing to trade as close as possible to the vwap as they are benchmarked on the vwap .",
    "+ although vwap orders represent a large part of algorithmic trading , there are only a few papers about vwap orders in the academic literature . the first important paper regarding liquidation with vwap benchmark",
    "was written by konishi @xcite .",
    "he developed a simple model and looked for the best static strategy , that is the best trading curve decided upon at the beginning of the liquidation process ( his goal is to minimize the variance of the slippage with respect to the vwap ) .",
    "he found that the optimal trading curve for vwap liquidation has the same shape as the relative market volume curve when volatility and market volume are uncorrelated .",
    "he also quantified the deviation from the relative market volume curve in the correlated case .",
    "the model was then extended by mcculloch and kazakov @xcite with the addition of a drift in a more constrained framework .",
    "mcculloch and kazakov also developed a dynamic model @xcite in which they conditioned the optimal trajectory with perfect knowledge of the volume by the available information at each period of time .",
    "bouchard and dang proposed in @xcite to use a stochastic target framework to develop vwap algorithms .",
    "recently , carmona and li @xcite also developed a model for vwap trading in which the trader can explicitly choose between market orders and limit orders to buy / sell shares .",
    "related to this literature on vwap trading ( see also @xcite ) , an academic literature appeared on market volume models .",
    "the papers by bialkowski et al .",
    "@xcite or mcculloch @xcite are instances of such papers modeling market volume dynamics and the intraday seasonality of relative volume .",
    "however , all these papers ignore an important point : market impact .",
    "the only paper dealing with vwap trading and involving a form of market impact is the interesting paper by frei and westray @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the price obtained by the trader is not the market price but a price depending linearly on the desired volume ( as in the early models of almgren and chriss ) .",
    "however , there is no permanent market impact in their model , while it plays an important role in our paper .",
    "+ the aim of our model is to include permanent market impact ( see @xcite for the framework we use ) and any form of execution costs in a model for vwap liquidation .",
    "also , our goal is not to obtain a price as close as possible to the vwap but rather to understand how to provide a guaranteed vwap service while mitigating risk . in other words",
    ", we want to find the optimal strategy if we are given a certain quantity of shares and asked to deliver the vwap over a predefined period .",
    "in addition to the optimal strategy underlying a guaranteed vwap contract , we are interested in the price of such a contract . for that purpose ,",
    "we use indifference pricing in a cara framework , as in @xcite where the author prices a large block of shares .",
    "this price for a guaranteed vwap contract is the minimum premium the trader needs to pay to the broker so that the latter accepts to deliver the vwap to the former .",
    "it depends on the size of the order , on liquidity and market conditions , and on the risk aversion of the broker .",
    "+ in section 2 , we present the general framework of our model .",
    "we introduce the definition of the vwap and the forms of market impact used in the model . the optimization criterion is defined and the price / premium of a guaranteed vwap contract is defined using indifference pricing . in section 3",
    ", we characterize the optimal liquidation strategy when the market volume curve is assumed to be known ( deterministic case ) , along with the premium of the guaranteed vwap contract . in section 4",
    ", we focus on special cases and numerics .",
    "we show that , in the absence of permanent market impact , the optimal trading curve has the same shape as the market volume curve .",
    "we consider also the case of linear permanent market impact and quadratic execution costs that permits to get closed form solutions and to better understand the role played by permanent market impact .",
    "finally , an efficient numerical method is provided to approximate the solution in the general case . in the last section ,",
    "we extend our model to the case of stochastic volumes and we characterize the price of a guaranteed vwap with a pde . +",
    "we consider a filtered probability space @xmath0 corresponding to the available information on the market , namely the market price and market volume of a stock up to the observation time . for @xmath1 ,",

    "the problem we address is the problem of the intermediary : he receives @xmath44 shares and sells them over the period @xmath5 $ ] to obtain @xmath47 on its cash account at time @xmath45 .",
    "then , he gives his client @xmath48 in cash .",

    "secondly , it corresponds to the way vwap strategies are often built in practice and we explained above why it was a good approximation . practitioners usually compute relative market volume curves based on historical data and try to follow this curve to get a price as close as possible to the vwap .",

    "the aim of this section is to provide a hamilton - jacobi - bellman pde to characterize the optimal liquidation strategy ( that is no longer deterministic , and hence no longer a trading curve decided upon in advance , at time @xmath14 ) and the premium of a guaranteed vwap contract .",
    "a similar approach , using stochastic optimal control , was adopted by frei and westray @xcite in the mean - variance setup . however , in their paper , the initial filtration is augmented with the knowledge of the final volume and this makes their approach questionable for practical use .",

    "if one considers indeed our problem with stochastic market volume in its initial form , 7 variables are necessary to describe the problem : the time @xmath9 , the trader s inventory @xmath200 , the asset market price @xmath279 , the cash account @xmath30 , the instantaneous market volume @xmath280 , the cumulated market volume @xmath281 , and a variable linked to the vwap , namely @xmath282 . using two changes of variables ,",
    "we manage to restrict the number of variables to 5 .",
    "classical numerical ( pde ) methods may fail to approximate the solution of the pde , but some probabilistic methods may be efficient ( see @xcite for robust methods in the case of problems in high dimension ) .",

    "in section 2 , we briefly discussed two alternative definitions of the vwap over @xmath5 $ ] :    @xmath349    and    @xmath43    in the former case , we exclude our own volume , while in the latter case , closer to the market definition , we include it .",
    "in fact , in both cases , our volume has an influence since the dynamics of the stock price depends on @xmath6 . in this appendix",
    ", we are going to prove that using one or the other definition does not make any difference , up to a change in the function @xmath330 and in @xmath350 .",
