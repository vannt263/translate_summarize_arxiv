    "highly correlated electron systems are characterized by a strong repulsion between electrons on the same lattice site , effectively restricting the dynamics to the fock subspace of states without double occupancy of sites .",
    "the prototype model for such systems is the anderson impurity model , which consists of an electron in a localized level @xmath2 ( called d - level in the following ) with on - site repulsion @xmath3 , hybridizing via a transition matrix element @xmath4 with one or several degenerate conduction electron bands or channels @xcite .",
    "depending on the number of channels @xmath5 , the model exhibits the single- or the multi - channel kondo effect , where at temperatures @xmath6 below the kondo temperature @xmath1 the local electron spin is screened ( @xmath7 ) or overscreened ( @xmath8 ) by the conduction electrons , leading to fermi liquid ( fl ) or to non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior @xcite with characteristic low - temperature singularities , respectively .    as perhaps the simplest model to investigate the salient features of correlations induced by short - range repulsion ,",
    "the anderson model plays a central role for the description of strongly correlated electron systems : in the limit of large spatial dimensions @xcite strongly correlated lattice systems reduce in general to a single anderson impurity hybridizing with a continuum of conduction electron states whose properties are determined from a self - consistency condition imposed by the translational invariance of the system @xcite .",
    "quantum impurity models have received further interest due to their relevance for mesoscopic systems like single electron transistors or quantum point contacts @xcite .",
    "nonlinear conductance anomalies observed in the latter systems @xcite have provided one of the strongest cases for the physical realization of the two - channel kondo effect generated by two - level systems with electron assisted tunneling .",
    "the above - mentioned systems call for the development of accurate and flexible theoretical methods , applicable to situations where exact solution methods are not available",
    ". we here present a general , well - controlled auxiliary boson technique which correctly describes the fl as well as the nfl case of the generalized su(n)@xmath0su(m ) anderson impurity model . as a standard diagram technique it has the potential",
    "to be generalized for correlated lattice problems as well as for non - equilibrium situations in mesoscopic systems .    in section 2",
    "we describe several exact properties of the auxiliary particle representation , while the conserving slave boson theory is developed and evaluated in section 3 .",
    "the auxiliary or slave boson method @xcite is a powerful tool to implement the effective restriction to the sector of fock space with no double occupancy imposed by a large on - site repulsion @xmath3 .",
    "the creation operator for an electron with spin @xmath9 in the @xmath10-level is written in terms of fermionic operators @xmath11 and bosonic operators @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "this representation is exact , if the constraint that the total number operator of auxiliary fermions @xmath11 and bosons @xmath12 is equal to unity is obeyed . @xmath14 and @xmath15 may be envisaged as creating the three allowed states of the impurity : singly occupied with spin @xmath9 or empty .    in view of the possibility of both fl and nfl behavior in quantum impurity systems mentioned in the introduction it is useful to introduce @xmath5 degenerate channels for the conduction electron operators @xmath16 ,",
    "labeled @xmath17 , in such a way that in the limit of impurity occupation number @xmath18 ( kondo limit ) the @xmath5-channel kondo model is recovered , i.e. the model obeys an su(m ) channel symmetry .",
    "the slave bosons then form an su(m ) multiplet @xmath19 which transforms according to the conjugate representation of su(m ) , so that @xmath20 is a conserved quantum number .",
    "generalizing , in addition , to arbitrary spin degeneracy @xmath21 , @xmath22 , one obtains the su(n)@xmath0su(m ) anderson impurity model in slave boson representation @xmath23 where the local operator constraint @xmath24 must be fulfilled at all times .",
    "the system described by the auxiliary particle hamiltonian ( [ sbhamilton ] ) is invariant under simultaneous , local @xmath25 gauge transformations , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 an arbitrary , time dependent phase . while the gauge symmetry guarantees the conservation of the local , integer charge @xmath29 , it does not single out any particular @xmath29 , like @xmath30 . in order to effect the projection onto the @xmath30 sector of fock space , one may use the following procedure @xcite :",
    "consider first the grand - canonical ensemble with respect to @xmath29 and the associated chemical potential @xmath31 .",
    "the expectation value in the @xmath30 subspace of any physical operator @xmath32 acting on the impurity states is then obtained as @xmath33 _ g }         { \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\zeta } \\mbox{tr }         \\bigl [ e^{-\\beta ( h+\\lambda q ) } \\bigr ] _ g } = \\lim _ { \\lambda \\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\langle \\hat a\\rangle _ g } { \\langle q \\rangle _ g}\\ , \\label{projection}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath34 denotes the grand canonical ensemble and @xmath35 is the fugacity @xmath36 . in the second equality of eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) we have used the fact that any physical operator @xmath32 acting on the impurity is composed of the impurity electron operators @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and thus annihilates the states in the @xmath39 sector , @xmath40 .",
    "it is obvious that the grand - canonical expectation value involved in eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) may be factorized into auxiliary particle propagators using wick s theorem , thus allowing for the application of standard diagrammatic techniques .",
    "it is important to note that , in general , @xmath41 plays the role of a time dependent gauge field . in eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) a time independent gauge for @xmath41 has been chosen . in this way",
    ", the projection is only performed at one instant of time , explicitly exploiting the conservation of the local charge @xmath29 .",
    "thus , choosing the time independent gauge means that in the subsequent development of the theory , the @xmath29 conservation must be implemented exactly .",
    "this is achieved in a systematic way by means of conserving approximations @xcite , i.e. by deriving all self - energies and vertices by functional derivation from one common luttinger - ward functional @xmath42 of the fully renormalized green s functions , @xmath43 this amounts to calculating all quantities of the theory in a self - consistent way , but has the great advantage that gauge field fluctuations need not be considered .",
    "the projection onto the physical subspace , eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) , implies that the pseudofermion and slave boson green s functions @xmath44 , @xmath45 are definied as the usual time - ordered , grand canonical expectation values of a pair of creation and annihilation operators , however evaluated in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "it follows that the traces involved in @xmath44 , @xmath45 are taken purely over the the @xmath39 sector of fock space , and thus the backward - in - time contribution to the auxiliary particle propagators vanishes .",
    "consequently , the auxiliary particle propagators are formally identical to the core hole propagators appearing in the well - known x - ray problem @xcite , and the long - time behavior of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is determined by the orthogonality catastrophe @xcite of the overlap of the fermi sea without impurity ( @xmath39 ) and the fully interacting conduction electron sea in the presence of a pseudofermion ( slave boson ) ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "it may be shown that the auxiliary particle spectral functions have threshold behavior with vanishing spectral weight at @xmath47 for energies",
    "@xmath48 below a threshold @xmath49 , and power law behavior above @xmath49 , @xmath50 .    for the single - channel anderson model , which is known to have a fl ground state ,",
    "the threshold exponents may be deduced from an analysis in terms of scattering phase shifts , using the friedel sum rule , since in the spin screened fl state the impurity acts as a pure potential scatterer @xcite , @xmath51 these results have been confirmed by numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculations @xcite and by use of the bethe ansatz solution in connection with boundary conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite . on the contrary , in the nfl case of the multi - channel kondo model the threshold exponents have been deduced by a cft solution @xcite as @xmath52 since the dependence of @xmath53 , @xmath54 on the impurity occupation number @xmath55 shown above originates from pure potential scattering , it is characteristic for the fl case .",
    "the auxiliary particle threshold exponents are , therefore , indicators for fl or nfl behavior in quantum impurity models of the anderson type .",
    "the conserving formulation discussed in section 2.2 precludes mean field approximations which break the @xmath25 gauge symmetry , like slave boson mean field theory .",
    "although the latter can in some cases successfully describe the low @xmath6 behavior of models with a fl ground state , it leads to a spurious phase transition at finite @xmath6 and , in particular , fails to describe nfl systems .",
    "rather , the approximation should be generated from a luttinger - ward functional @xmath42 . using the hybridization @xmath4 as a small parameter",
    ", one may generate successively more complex approximations .",
    "the lowest order conserving approximation generated in this way is the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) @xcite , defined by the first diagram in fig .",
    "[ ctma ] , labeled `` nca '' . the nca is successful in describing anderson type models at temperatures above and around the kondo temperature @xmath1 , and even reproduces the threshold exponents eq .",
    "( [ alpha_fb2 ] ) for the nfl case of the anderson impurity model . however , it fails to describe the fl regime at low temperatures .",
    "this may be traced back to the failure to capture the spin - screened kondo singlet ground state of the model , since coherent spin flip scattering is not included in nca , as seen below .      in order to eliminate the shortcomings of the nca mentioned above",
    ", we may use as a guiding principle to look for contributions to the vertex functions which renormalize the auxiliary particle threshold exponents to their correct values , since this is a necessary condition for the description of fl and nfl behavior , as discussed in section 2.3 . as shown by power counting arguments @xcite , there are no corrections to the nca exponents in any finite order of perturbation theory .",
    "thus , any renormalization of the nca exponents must be due to singularities arising from an infinite resummation of terms .",
    "in general , the existence of collective excitations leads to a singular behavior of the corresponding two  particle vertex function . in view of the tendency of kondo systems to form a collective spin singlet state",
    ", we expect a singularity in the spin singlet channel of the pseudofermion",
    " conduction electron vertex function .",
    "it is then natural to perform a partial resummation of those contributions which , at each order in the hybridization @xmath4 , contain the maximum number of spin flip processes",
    ". this amounts to calculating the conduction electron ",
    "pseudofermion vertex function in the `` ladder '' or t - matrix approximation , @xmath56 , where the irreducible vertex is given by @xmath57 .",
    "the bethe  salpeter equation for @xmath56 reads ( fig .",
    "[ tmat ] ) , @xmath58where @xmath9 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 represent spin indices and @xmath20 a channel index .",
    "a similar integral equation holds for the charge fluctuation t - matrix @xmath62 ; it is obtained from @xmath56 by interchanging @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "inserting nca green s functions for the intermediate state propagators of eq .",
    "( [ cftmateq ] ) , we find at low temperatures and in the kondo regime @xmath65 a pole of @xmath56 in the singlet channel as a function of the center  of  mass ( com ) frequency @xmath66 , at a frequency which scales with the kondo temperature , @xmath67 . similarly , the corresponding @xmath6-matrix @xmath62 in the conduction electron  slave boson channel , evaluated within the analogous approximation , develops a pole at negative values of @xmath66 in the empty orbital regime @xmath68 . in the mixed valence regime ( @xmath69",
    "the poles in both @xmath56 and @xmath62 coexist .",
    "the appearance of poles in the two  particle vertex functions @xmath56 and @xmath62 , which signals the formation of collective states , may be expected to influence the behavior of the system in a major way .",
    "the approximation considered so far is not yet consistent : the spectral weight produced by the poles of @xmath56 and @xmath62 at negative frequencies @xmath66 is strictly prohibited in the limit @xmath70 by the threshold property of auxiliary particle vertex functions ( compare section 2.3 ) .",
    "however , recall that a minimum requirement on the approximation used is the conservation of gauge symmetry .",
    "this requirement is not met when the integral kernel of the @xmath6-matrix equation is approximated by the nca result .",
    "rather , the approximation should be generated from the luttinger - ward functional shown in fig .",
    "it is defined as the infinite series of all vacuum skeleton diagrams which consist of a single ring of auxiliary particle propagators , where each conduction electron line spans at most two hybridization vertices .",
    "the first diagram of the infinite series of ctma terms corresponds to nca . by functional differentiation with respect to the conduction electron green s function and the pseudofermion or the slave boson propagator , respectively , the shown @xmath42 functional generates the ladder approximations @xmath56 , @xmath62 for the total conduction electron - pseudofermion vertex function and for the total conduction electron - slave boson vertex function ( fig .",
    "[ tmat ] ) .",
    "the auxiliary particle self - energies are obtained in the conserving scheme as the functional derivatives of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath44 or @xmath45 , respectively ( eq .  ( [ fderiv ] ) ) , and are , in turn , nonlinear functionals of the full , renormalized auxiliary particle propagators .",
    "this defines a set of self - consistency equations , which we term conserving t - matrix approximation ( ctma ) .",
    "the ctma is justified on formal grounds by a cancellation theorem for all diagrams not included in the generating functional @xmath42 @xcite : as seen in fig .",
    "[ ctma ] , @xmath42 includes _ all _ contributions where a conduction electron line spans up to two hybridization vertices ; contributions not included contain at least one conduction electron arch spanning four vertices .",
    "these contributions cancel pairwise at arbitrary loop order to leading and subleading order in the external frequency , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cancellation ] .",
    "we have solved the ctma equations numerically for a wide range of impurity occupation numbers @xmath55 from the kondo to the empty impurity regime both for the single - channel and for the two - channel anderson model down to temperatures of the order of at least @xmath71 .",
    "the solution of the ctma equations forces the t - matrices to have vanishing spectral weight at negative com frequencies @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , the numerical evaluation shows that the poles of @xmath56 and @xmath62 are shifted to @xmath72 by self - consistency , where they merge with the continuous spectral weight present for @xmath73 , and thus renormalize the threshold exponents of the auxiliary spectral functions . for @xmath74 , @xmath7 the threshold exponents",

    "[ exponents ] . in the kondo limit of the multi  channel case ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) the ctma solutions are found not to alter the nca values and reproduce the the correct threshold exponents , @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the good agreement of the ctma exponents with their exact values over the complete range of @xmath55 for the single  channel model and in the kondo regime of the multi  channel model may be taken as evidence that the t - matrix approximation correctly describes both the fl and the non  fl regimes of the su(n)@xmath0su(m ) anderson model ( n=2 , m=1,2,4 ) .",
    "the static spin susceptibility @xmath79 of the single- and of the two - channel anderson model in the kondo regime calculated within ctma as the derivative of the magnetization @xmath80 with respect to a magnetic field @xmath81 is shown in fig .",
    "good quantitative agreement with exact solutions is found for @xmath74 , @xmath7 ( fl ) . for @xmath74 , @xmath82 ( nfl ) ctma correctly reproduces the exact @xcite logarithmic temperature dependence below the kondo scale @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , the nca solution recovers the logarithmic behavior only far below @xmath1 .",
