    "the desired feature is of course finiteness of the embedding space @xmath1 , otherwise the linearization remains formal . on the other hand , it is worthwhile to recall the applications of linearization in infinite - dimensional spaces .",

    "if at least one of its closed subsets is known , then that structure can be used to form a linear semigroup of isomorphic structure , and obtain differential system of constraints for the desired projection map @xmath3 .",
    "this method is illustrated by two examples : the ` classical ' riccati equation related to the symmetry group @xmath4 , and a thorough analysis of a logistic equation , with emphasis on the role played by similarities in classification of obtained continuous - time solutions ( the inverse maps ) .",

    "assuming there exists a homomorphism between @xmath108 and @xmath111 the problem of linearization reduces to finding a map @xmath0 such that @xmath112 let the explicit , coordinate form of @xmath113 be @xmath114 differentiating with respect to @xmath115 and @xmath116 gives two independent relations @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the coordinate vector of the point @xmath115 , @xmath119 . comparing the above equations we get @xmath120 where all omitted argumets of @xmath3 are @xmath115 , and as before @xmath121 , that is @xmath122^\\idb\\null_{\\idd}\\partial_\\iga\\ml^\\idd\\null_\\idc $ ] .",
