    "one of fundamental questions in physics is whether or not the physical constants are literally constant . in fact , the physical constants may change in spacetime within the context of some unification theories such as superstring theory and investigating their constancy is an important probe of those theories .",

    "@xcite obtained @xmath11 , whereas refs .",
    "@xcite argued that the constraint should be much weaker due to uncertainties in the decay rate modeling .",
    "on the other hand , there are three kinds of celestial probes .",
    "one is to use big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite which provides constraints at very high redshifts ( @xmath12-@xmath13 ) , for example , @xmath14 ( 95% c.l . )",

    "for example , bbn constraint improves by up to about 2 orders ( @xmath25 @xcite ) although the factor may vary depending on how they are correlated to @xmath0 .",
    "hence , it is important to consider the variation of other coupling constants along with @xmath0 .    in this paper",

    "since such theory is now under development , how their variations are related to each other can not be predicted .",

    "[ fig : a_cl ] and [ fig : m_cl ] . increasing @xmath0 or @xmath1 shift the peak positions to higher values of @xmath100 and amplify the peak heights .",

    "using @xmath112 to denote the position of a peak , @xmath113 for the angular diameter distance and @xmath114 for the sound horizon , one can write @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the redshift of the last scattering surface . increasing @xmath0 or @xmath1 increases the redshift of the last scattering surface due to the larger binding energy , as in figs .",
    "[ fig : a_vis ] and  [ fig : m_vis ] .",
    "the higher @xmath116 in turn corresponds to a smaller sound horizon and a larger angular diameter distance , which lead to a higher value of @xmath112 .",
    "the changes in the peak heights are caused by modifications to the early isw effect and the diffusion damping .",
    "the larger @xmath116 leads to the larger early isw effect making the first peak higher . to consider the effect beyond the first peak , we focus our attention on the visibility function .",
    "the peak of the visibility function moves to a larger redshift since the recombination occurs at higher redshift , when the expansion rate is faster .",
    "hence , the temperature and @xmath103 decreases more rapidly , making the peak width of the visibility function narrower ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : a_vis ] and [ fig : m_vis ] ) .",
    "since the width of the visibility function corresponds to the damping scale , an increase in @xmath0 or @xmath1 decreases the effect of damping .",
    "this is the reason why the amplitude at larger @xmath100 increases with increasing @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : a_vis ] and [ fig : m_vis ] , @xmath0 changes the visibility function width more than @xmath1 does ( quantitatively , an increase of @xmath0 or @xmath1 by 5@xmath3 makes the full width at half maximum of the visibility function narrower by 10@xmath3 or 2@xmath3 respectively ) because the binding energy which scales as @xmath89 .",
    "thus the damping scale is more sensitive to the change of @xmath0 than @xmath1 , as appears in figs .",
    "[ fig : a_cl ] and [ fig : m_cl ] .",
    "now we discuss the effects of varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 somewhat more quantitatively using the following four quantities which characterize a shape of cmb power spectrum @xcite : the position of the first peak @xmath117 , the height of the first peak relative to the large angular - scale amplitude evaluated at @xmath118 , @xmath119 the ratio of the second peak ( @xmath120 ) height to the first @xmath121 the ratio of the third peak ( @xmath122 ) height to the first @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "note that these four quantities do not depend on overall amplitude .",
    "we calculate the response of these four quantities when we vary the parameters @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath30 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "when we vary one parameter , the other parameters are fixed and flatness is always assumed ( especially , increasing @xmath30 means increasing @xmath127 because @xmath128 ) . @xmath129 and values at the fiducial parameter values are @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 . derivatives of @xmath117 and @xmath134 with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 are positive as is expected from the considerations above . furthermore , @xmath135 and @xmath136 are much larger than the other derivatives of @xmath117 while @xmath137 and @xmath138 have relatively similar values to the other derivatives of @xmath134 .",
    "since such changes are most effectively mimicked by the change in @xmath30 , it is considered to be the most degenerate parameter with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we have seen above that when @xmath0 or @xmath1 increases , the first peak is enhanced by larger isw effect and the second or higher peaks are enhanced by smaller diffusion damping .",
    "the derivatives of @xmath139 and @xmath140 tell us which effect is important .",
    "since @xmath141 and @xmath142 are positive and larger than the derivatives with respect to @xmath1 , we see that the effect on the diffusion damping is more significant than that on the early isw for varying @xmath0 .",
    "they seem to somewhat cancel each other for varying @xmath1 especially regarding @xmath140 .",
    "such behavior is consistent with the consideration at the end of the previous paragraph , that the diffusion damping is more sensitive to the change in @xmath0 than @xmath1 .",
    "we expect a unified theory can predict the values of the coupling constants , how they are related to each other and how much they vary in cosmological time scale . in string theory , a candidate for unified theory , there is a dilaton field whose expectation value determines the values of coupling constants .",
    "however , since it is not fully formulated at present , we have to assume how @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related to vary and constrain their variations . to be concrete , following ref .",
    "@xcite , let us start from considering the low energy action derived from heterotic string theory in the einstein frame .",
    "the action is written as @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the dilaton field , @xmath145 is an arbitrary scalar field , and @xmath146 is an arbitrary fermion .",
    "@xmath147 is the gauge covariant derivative corresponding to gauge fields with field strength @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 is the conformal factor which is used to move from string frame .",
    "more concretely , @xmath145 is the higgs field and @xmath151 is its potential .",
    "the overall factor @xmath107 before the scalar potential means that the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath152 is independent of the dilaton so it is taken to be constant .",
    "@xmath148 is the gauge field with gauge group including @xmath153 .",
    "we define its lagrangian density for the gauge field as @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the unified coupling constant . compared with equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : heterotic_action ] ) , @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the planck scale .",
    "we can calculate the gauge coupling constants at low energy using renormalization group equations .",
    "@xmath0 almost does not run , and hence the @xmath0 at low energy @xmath158 as for the other gauge coupling constants , variation of the strong coupling constant may affect cmb since its low energy value determines the qcd scale @xmath159 which in turn determines nucleon masses .",
    "however , how the variation of @xmath159 is related to that of @xmath0 at low energy can not uniquely be determined from eq .",
