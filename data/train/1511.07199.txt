    "gas dynamics of the weakly ionized protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) is to a large extent controlled by its coupling with magnetic fields , described by non - ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects , including ohmic resistivity , the hall effect and ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) .",
    "the three effects dominate in different regions of ppds , and affect the gas dynamics in different ways .",
    "a constant theme of ppd research has been to estimate the strength of magnetic diffusivities , and study their consequences to gas dynamics , especially on the level of turbulence and efficiency of angular momentum transport ( see @xcite for recent review ) .",
    "the strength of magnetic diffusivities largely depends on gas density @xmath11 , level of ionization , and magnetic field strength @xmath12 . in the absence of grains ,",
    "the ohmic , hall and ambipolar diffusivities can be expressed in particularly simple form @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is resistivity due to electrons , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the electron and neutral number densities , and @xmath17 is the ion density .",
    "these expressions are complicated by the presence of dust grains . on the one hand",
    ", grains can substantially reduce the level of ionization , and hence boosting all three magnetic diffusivities proportionally .",
    "on the other hand , grains carry charge and result in much more complex dependence of diffusivities on magnetic field strength ( e.g. , see @xcite and @xcite ) , yet such complex dependence has not been systematically explored .    as an initial effort",
    ", @xcite ( hereafter b11 ) considered the limit when grains are tiny ( @xmath18 nm sized pahs ) so that the conductivity of charged grains is similar to ions .",
    "he showed that when tiny grains are the dominant charge carrier , hall diffusivity diminishes and ad is substantially reduced in the strong field limit , which may be important in the outer region of ppds .    in this paper , we extend the work of b11 to more general situations with more typical grain sizes ( sub - micron to micron ) relevant to ppds .",
    "we focus on the disk interior ( rather than surface ) where grains are likely the dominant charge carrier , and are mostly singly charged , and systematically explore how magnetic diffusivities depend on field strength .",
    "we hope to provide researchers a useful guidance on modeling non - ideal mhd effects from ionization chemistry , which has been fruitful in the recent years ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    this work is also motivated by the recent advances in understanding the gas dynamics of the hall effect , where the hall - shear instability may substantially amplify the midplane field strength in the inner region of ppds @xcite when the background field is aligned with disk rotation . with strong field amplification",
    ", we discuss whether grain - modified diffusivities can feedback to ppd gas dynamics .",
    "we present our simplified model in section [ sec : model ] , with application to ppds discussed in section [ sec : app ] .",
    "we perform mhd simulations of the inner disk and discuss the results in section [ sec : sim ] . in section [ sec : sum ] , we summarize and conclude .",
    "in weakly ionized gas , the general expressions for the three magnetic diffusivities are @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 are ohmic , hall and pederson conductivities , defined as @xmath21 where summation goes over all charged species @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the number density and charge of individual charged species .",
    "the hall parameter @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 which describes the ratio between the gyro - frequency of the charged species and its collision frequency with the neutrals , where @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being rate coefficient for collisional momentum transfer with the neutrals .",
    "the charged species @xmath22 is strongly coupled to the neutrals if @xmath29 ( weak field ) , and it is strongly coupled to magnetic fields when @xmath30 ( strong field ) .",
    "the values of @xmath28 for electron , ion and grain can be found in equation ( 14)-(16 ) of @xcite , giving hall parameter @xmath31\\ , \\\\",
    "\\beta_i & \\approx   3.3\\times10^{-3}(b / n_{15})\\ , \\\\",
    "\\beta_g & \\approx ( b / n_{15})\\min\\ [ 3.2\\times10^{-3}|z_g|^{-1},\\   10^{-9}a_1^{-2}t_{100}^{-1/2 } ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is magnetic field measured in gauss , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is grain charge , @xmath34 is grain size in @xmath35 , disk temperature @xmath36 . clearly , @xmath37 , and unless grain size is tiny ( @xmath38 nm ) , @xmath39 .",
    "as long as ion mass is much larger than neutral mass , different ion species have their hall parameters very close to @xmath40 quoted above , and can be treated as a single species . in the interior of ppds where ionization level is low ,",
    "chemistry calculations show that ( small ) grains are largely singly charged until the ionization fraction exceeds grain abundance towards disk surface ( e.g. , figure 6 of @xcite and figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we also assume single - sized grains for simplicity , which is typically adopted in ppd chemistry calculations .",
    "while a grain size distribution is expected in reality , we expect a single - size treatment to capture and better clarify the essence of their effects .",
    "therefore , we consider only four types of charged species : electrons , ions , and positive / negative charged grains , whose number densities are represented by @xmath15 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    under these conditions ,",
    "the hall and pederson conductivities read @xmath44 hereafter , we omit the prefactor @xmath45 in conductivities and @xmath46 in diffusivities so as to make them dimensionless . the grain - free diffusivities ( [ eq : diff1 ] ) corresponds to @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and hence the conventional ohmic regime applies in weak field with @xmath50 , ad regime applies in strong field @xmath51 , and the hall dominated regime lies in between . for brevity",
    ", we further define @xmath52 .",
    "charge neutrality gurantees that only three of the four number densities are independent . with additional normalization by @xmath15 ,",
    "only two of them serve as independent model parameters .",
    "we find it useful to choose the two ratios @xmath53 , @xmath54 as model variables . without grains , their values",
    "are obviously @xmath55 and @xmath56 , while when grains become important charge carriers , @xmath57 , and @xmath58",
    ". the hall parameters @xmath59 can be considered as a proxy for magnetic field strength . according to ( [ eq : beta ] ) , we fix @xmath60 in our calculations .",
    "the ratio @xmath61 reflects grain size and defines our last ( third ) model parameter . for @xmath62 m sized grains , @xmath63 , and only for @xmath64 m we have @xmath65 .",
    "we are mainly interested in reducing ( [ eq : con ] ) to sufficiently simple and intuitive expressions .",
    "ohmic resistivity is the most straightforward and can be written as @xmath66 where we have defined @xmath67 in general , ohmic resistivity results from electron conductivity .",
    "contributions from the ions and grains become significant ( @xmath68 ) only when @xmath69 and @xmath70 , both requiring grain charge density to be overwhelmingly dominant .",
    "calculations of the hall and ambipolar diffusivities involve much more complex algebra , and sufficiently simple expressions can only be obtained in asymptotic regimes . in the weak field regime ( equivalently , ohmic dominated regime )",
    "where @xmath71 , we taylor expand the expressions for @xmath72 , @xmath73 in equation ( [ eq : con ] ) and keep the leading order terms , or @xmath74 , which is almost always the case from chemistry calculations . ] .",

    "where @xmath82 , we can reduce the hall and pederson conductivities to @xmath83+\\frac{1}{\\beta_g^2}\\ , \\\\",

    ", we see that in the strong field regime , @xmath2 becomes negative when @xmath87 in general , the sign of @xmath2 depends on the relative mass ( mobility ) between the positive and negative charge carrier . in the absence of grains , with electrons much more mobile than ions , @xmath2 is positive . in the presence of tiny grains with @xmath77 as considered by b11 , charged grains are as mobile as normal ions",
    ". therefore , negative charge carriers are still effectively more mobile due to the presence of electrons , and hence @xmath88 .",
    "relation ( [ eq : sign ] ) states that , as long as grains are not too small ( i.e. well above nanometer size so that @xmath89 ) , @xmath2 can become negative whenever there are more ions than electrons .",
    "in other words , there are more negatively charged grains than positively ones , and hence negative charge carriers are effectively less mobile .",
    "we will see in section [ sec : app ] that @xmath90 almost always holds from ionization chemistry calculations in ppds .",
    "the main practical question then is whether disk magnetic field can reach the level such that @xmath2 changes sign .",
    "we therefore define @xmath3 as the threshold field strength beyond which @xmath2 changes sign , and this is a main quantity of interest that we study in the rest of the paper .      in figure",
    "[ fig : analytic_diff ] , we show the dimensionless ohmic , hall and the ambipolar diffusivities as a function of magnetic field strength ( characterized by the electron hall parameter ) , covering most of the parameter space relevant for grain size @xmath91 m ( see figure caption ) .",
    "we first confirm that @xmath92 and @xmath93 holds both in weak ( @xmath94 ) and strong ( @xmath95 ) field regimes as expected . in between",
    ", we see that both @xmath2 and @xmath1 exhibit complex variations with @xmath12 , where @xmath2 changes sign in all cases , and @xmath1 is reduced in steps compared with the @xmath96 scaling .",
    "top two panels of figure [ fig : analytic_diff ] correspond to cases where grains are modestly important charge carrier , giving @xmath53 not far from order unity .",
    "we see that for field strength with @xmath97 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 behave normally as in conventional ohmic and hall regimes .",
    "sign change of @xmath2 and reduction of @xmath1 are both achieved towards stronger field ( in the conventional ad regime ) with @xmath51 ( and @xmath98 ) .    on the other hand , in the bottom two panels ,",
    "assuming grains are the dominant charge carriers such that @xmath99 , we see that magnetic diffusivities behaves qualitatively differently .",
    "first , the threshold field strength @xmath3 for @xmath2 to change sign is much weaker , close to @xmath100 .",
    "similarly , reduction of @xmath1 starts right from @xmath100 .",
    "secondly , ohmic resistivity dominates all the way through the conventional hall - regime ( @xmath101 , @xmath97 ) , while the hall effect dominates only in much stronger field ( @xmath51 and @xmath98 ) , which is in the conventional ad - dominated regime .",
    "ad dominates only when the field is much stronger with @xmath102 .",
    "overall , we see that the ratio @xmath53 largely controls the dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath1 on magnetic field strength , especially towards weaker field ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "other parameters ( grain size and @xmath54 ) mainly affect diffusivity behaviors towards strong field with @xmath51 , leading to complex dependence before reaching the asymptotic regime ( [ eq : eta_a ] ) at @xmath102 , and trend can be identified by comparing the left and right panels of figure [ fig : analytic_diff ] .",
    "to test our analytical results , we conduct ionization - recombination chemistry calculation using a complex reaction network developed in @xcite and @xcite that followed from @xcite . there are 175 gas - phase species and over two thousands gas phase reactions extracted from the latest version of the umist database @xcite .",
    "the rate coefficients in the data base are given as a function of temperature .",
    "one change from our previous chemistry calculations is that when gas temperature lies out of the stated range of validity , we still use the given formula as if it remained valid ( whereas originally we computed the coefficients using upper or lower bound of valid temperature range ) . for inner disk temperatures ( @xmath104k ) , about @xmath105 of the reactions are affected , majority of which are neutral - neutral reactions , and/or reactions with large activation energy . in the latter case , our original approach tends to significantly overestimate the reaction rates at lower temperatures .",
    "also , for many of these reactions , we note that the rate coefficients listed in the kida chemical database generally have different valid temperature ranges with similar coefficients",
    ". this change does not affect the level of ionization in the presence of grains ( but leads to higher ionization fraction in the grain - free case ) , while the composition of ion species is affected .",
    "we include a single grain population with maximum grain charge of @xmath106 , with fiducial choices of grain size @xmath107 m and dust - to - gas mass ratio of @xmath108 .",
    "although such grain size and abundance are likely exaggerated considering that substantial grain growth must have occurred in ppds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they are the best to illustrate the effects that we discuss in this paper . given that large uncertainties remain in our understandings of grain size distribution in ppds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we also consider a few other combinations of grain sizes and abundances to study parameter depdendnce .",
    "note that for chemical purposes , we are only concerned with the abundance of sub - micron sized grains , which is the most relevant to ionization and charging .",
    "we adopt the minimum - mass solar nebular ( mmsn ) disk model that is vertically isothermal with standard cosmic - ray and x - ray ionization prescriptions as described in @xcite , together with a constant ionization rate of @xmath109 s@xmath110 as a proxy for radioactive decay ( the exact value matters little ) .",
    "the relative importance of non - ideal mhd effects in ppds is conveniently described by the dimensionless elsasser numbers , defined as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the alfvn speed , @xmath113 is disk angular frequency .",
    "non - ideal mhd effects become dominant when the ( absolute value of ) respective elsasser numbers becomes smaller than order unity .",
    "note that in our definition , @xmath114 will change sign when @xmath2 becomes negative .      in figure",
    "[ fig : abundance ] , we show the vertical profile of charged species abundance at 1 au and 5 au using fiducial grain size ( @xmath107 m ) and mass ratio ( @xmath108 ) in the top two panels . we see that grains are the dominant charge carriers within @xmath9 disk scale heights ( @xmath115 ) about disk midplane , leading to large ratios of @xmath53 .",
    "this situation is similar to the solid curves in the two bottom panels of figure [ fig : analytic_diff ] , and we have confirmed that our simple four - species model well captures the @xmath2 and @xmath1 behaviors computed from the full chemical abundances using ( [ eq : sigfull ] ) .",
    "as long as most grains are singly charged . in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : abundance ]",
    ", we further show the threshold field strength @xmath3 ( beyond which @xmath2 changes sign ) as a function of height above midplane . to guide eye , we further plot field strengths that correspond to @xmath100 and @xmath116 ( pink ) , as well as field strengths that give plasma @xmath117 , ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure , to be @xmath55 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we first focus on the fiducial case with @xmath107 m and @xmath120 ( blue lines ) .",
    "we see that within @xmath121 , @xmath3 is well below the @xmath116 line , consistent with our expectations given @xmath57 . towards the surface , as ionization fraction approaches and then exceeds grain abundance , we see while @xmath2 can still change sign , but at field strength well beyond @xmath116 , analogous to the top panels of figure [ fig : analytic_diff ] .",
    "we also note that the threshold field strength @xmath3 corresponds to only modest level of magnetization , with @xmath10 within @xmath122 about midplane , which is very likely accessible in real ppds ( see next subsection ) .    using different grain size and",
    "abundances yield different threshold field strengths @xmath3 . reducing dust - to - gas mass ratio by a factor of 100 to @xmath123 increases @xmath3 by about an order of magnitude ,",
    "and we see that at both 1 au and 5 au , field strength near or above equipartition ( @xmath124 ) is needed to have @xmath2 change sign .",
    "this is much less likely to be achieved in ppds , at least under standard disk models where field strength well below equipartition is sufficient to drive disk accretion at expected accretion rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , for the same dust - to - gas mass ratio @xmath123 ,",
    "reducing the grain size further to @xmath125 m yields results similar to the fiducial case .",
    "this is because smaller grains have higher total surface area / abundance at given mass , both are favorable to make charged grains dominant charge carriers .      extending the discussion to a broad range of disk radii , we show in figure [ fig : etahsign ] the threshold field strength @xmath3 as a function of orbital radius @xmath126 , and present the results at disk midplane ( @xmath127 ) and intermediate height ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "moving towards larger disk radii , ionization fraction increases systematically ( due to reduced density and deeper penetration of external ionization ) , as can be traced from figure [ fig : abundance ] .",
    "this makes @xmath3 shift up relative to the @xmath116 line as discussed before . in the mean time , as gas density / pressure drops , field strength at fixed plasma @xmath117 also shifts up relative to the @xmath116 line , as is straightforward to show from their definitions ( @xmath129 v.s .",
    "@xmath130 ) . as a result , we see from figure [ fig : etahsign ] that line showing @xmath3 as a function of @xmath126 is approximately parallel the constant plasma @xmath117 line over a very wide range of radii .    in figure [ fig : etahsign ] , we have considered a broad collection of grain sizes and abundances .",
    "we are particularly interested in the question of for which combinations of grain sizes and abundances can @xmath2 change sign in the expected range of ppd magnetic field strength .",
    "we consider plasma @xmath131 as a target field strength , which is easily achieved in either pure magnetorotational instability ( mri , @xcite ) turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or in more realistic studies of ppd gas dynamics ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "field strength above equipartition is unlikely in the disk interior . for reference",
    ", we also mark the possible field strength of the solar nebular inferred from the semekona meteorites @xcite , which likely corresponds to midplane field strength at @xmath132 au during the epoch of chondrule formation .",
    "although large uncertainties remain , field strength of up to @xmath131 in an mmsn disk is reasonably consistent with the inferred nebular field strength .    from figure [",
    "fig : etahsign ] , it is clear that small grains in large abundance is essential to make @xmath3 sufficiently weak ( plasma @xmath133 ) that can potentially be achieved in ppds .",
    "in particular , the results from our fiducial choice of @xmath107 m , @xmath108 are very similar to those obtained with the @xmath134 m , @xmath123 case , at both @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "this might suggest an empirical criterion where @xmath135 should be at least order unity ( with @xmath136 measured in @xmath6 m ) in order to achieve a sufficiently weak threshold field @xmath3 .",
    "note that a constant @xmath135 corresponds to a constant @xmath137 where @xmath16 is grain number density .",
    "therefore , the controlling parameter is not the total grain surface area ( @xmath138 ) , but lies in between total surface area and number density .",
    "we might further generalize this consideration into a distribution of grain sizes , and define @xmath139 our discussions above suggest @xmath140 to achieve sufficiently weak @xmath3 .",
    "we note that when assuming the standard mrn size distribution for interstellar grains @xcite , with @xmath141 between @xmath142 m and @xmath143 m , we obtain @xmath144 . therefore , while grain growth in ppds must substantially reduces @xmath145 from interstellar value , we do expect that grain - modified diffusivities is likely relevant at least in some stages of ppd evolution .",
    "although @xmath2 can change sign essentially at all distances , it is mainly the inner disk ( @xmath146 or at most a few tens of 10 au ) that is the most relevant .",
    "conventionally , @xmath51 marks the dominance of ad over the hall effect , which is achieved at lower density regions towards the outer disk .",
    "the complex dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on field strength in the presence of abundant small grains complicates the situation . in figure",
    "[ fig : etaareduce ] , we show the ad and hall elsasser numbers @xmath147 and @xmath114 as a function of magnetic field strength at 30 au and 100 au , at both disk midplane and intermediate height ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "we consider three combination of grain sizes and abundances as before and discuss the results below .",
    "we first see that @xmath147 is constant at both weak and strong field regimes , as expected . in the presence of abundant small grains ( @xmath140 , black and red lines ) ,",
    "the difference in @xmath147 between the two regimes can reach several orders of magnitude . in between at intermediate field strength",
    ", we have @xmath148constant or @xmath149 ( see also figure [ fig : analytic_diff ] ) .",
    "therefore , ad behaves the same way as ohmic resistivity ( except for its anisotropy ) .",
    "these trends are the same as those discussed in b11 in the presence of tiny ( @xmath150 nm ) grains .",
    "if we expect field strengths in the outer ppds correspond to plasma @xmath151 , then roughly speaking , the midplane region up to @xmath152 au , and upper layer ( @xmath128 ) up to @xmath153 au would lie in this intermediate regime when @xmath140 .    with less amount of small grains ( @xmath154 , blue lines in figure [ fig : etaareduce ] ) ,",
    "on the other hand , reduction of ad occurs at much stronger field . for both 30 au and 100 au , both at midplane and a few scale heights above , such reduction requires field strength above equipartition level , thus is unlikely to be relevant .",
    "in fact , for our choice of @xmath107 m and @xmath123 , the ionization fraction at disk midplane already exceeds grain abundance , and hence the role of grains is only minor . in this case , we see that @xmath155 is a good proxy over a wide range of disk radii and vertical locations , consistent with previous findings @xcite .",
    "we also see that in the presence of abundant small grains , substantial reduction of ad towards strong field ( @xmath51 ) is accompanied by sign change of @xmath2 , and the hall effect can dominate over ad ( in the conventional ad dominated regime ) .",
    "this is consistent features seen in figure [ fig : analytic_diff ] ( e.g. , bottom panels ) . therefore , the hall effect may play a more important role than commonly assumed .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note : we use grain size @xmath107 m for all runs , and  any \" means  full \" or ",
    "simple \" diffusivity treatments yield same results .",
    "see section [ ssec : setup ] for more details .",
    "the ad elsasser number @xmath147 directly controls the level of the mri turbulence , and @xmath155 is generally considered to be sufficiently strong to substantially damp the mri @xcite .",
    "further introducing a modestly strong hall term would enhance the level of turbulence if net vertical field is aligned with disk rotation @xmath156 , while reduce it for opposite polarity @xcite . the grain - modified magnetic diffusivities in the outer disk studied here may lead to two interesting effects when @xmath140 .",
    "first , the fact that ad behaves similarly as ohmic resistivity at intermediate field strength may lead to cycles of growth and decay of the mri as observed in resistive mri simulations @xcite .",
    "second , the sign change of @xmath2 means that the enhancement of the mri by the hall effect would occur at anti - aligned field polarity , rather than aligned polarity .",
    "these effects deserve further investigation via three - dimensional mhd simulations .",
    "to further study the effect of grain - modified magnetic diffusivities on ppd gas dynamics , we follow @xcite ( hereafter b14 ) and conduct local stratified shearing - box mhd simulations that include all three non - ideal mhd terms . note that b14 simply assumed @xmath157 , @xmath158 in the calculations , and used a 2d diffusivity table showing the proportional coefficients as a function of density and ionization rate to compute the diffusivities . to incorporate the complex dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath1 on magnetic field strength , we extend the diffusivity table to 3d that explicitly accounts for this dependence",
    ".    here we mainly focus on the inner disk region ( @xmath159 au ) , where it suffices to conduct quasi-1d simulations cells in radial and azimuthal dimensions , which facilitates the simulations to relax to a steady state . ]",
    "( as verified in @xcite ) because the mri is largely suppressed .",
    "the simulations use isothermal equation of state , and the simulation box extends from @xmath160 to @xmath161 in @xmath162 , with a resolution of 18 cells per @xmath115 .",
    "we consider examples at two radii @xmath163 au and @xmath164 au , using diffusivity tables with fixed grain size @xmath107 m but two different abundances @xmath108 and @xmath8 . an artificial boost of ionization rate beyond column densities of @xmath165 g @xmath166 is included to mimic the effect of fuv ionization that brings the gas to ideal mhd regime .",
    "all simulations are conducted with net vertical magnetic field @xmath167 threading the disk , and the field strength is parameterized by plasma @xmath168 defined as ratio of midplane gas pressure to magnetic pressure of the net vertical field .",
    "we consider @xmath169 and @xmath170 , as adopted in most previous works chosen to yield accretion rate in the expected range for the mmsn disk model . in code units",
    ", we have midplane density @xmath171 , isothermal sound speed @xmath172 , keplerian frequency @xmath173 , and magnetic permeability @xmath174 .",
    "it is well known that the effect of the hall term depends on the polarity of background vertical field @xmath167 threading the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "of particular interest is the case where @xmath156 , or background field being aligned with rotation axis .",
    "linear analysis as well as numerical simulations have shown that in this case , horizontal components of the magnetic field can be strongly amplified due to the hall shear instability ( hsi , @xcite ) . because both radial and azimuthal components are amplified , maxwell stress ( @xmath175 ) is strongly enhanced which likely plays a non - negligible role in disk angular momentum transport .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath176 , the opposite occurs , and the horizontal field is reduced to close to zero near the midplane region @xcite . because the interesting effects we have discussed in this paper operate when magnetic field gets amplified , we consider only aligned polarity @xmath156 in our simulations .",
    "we run the simulations following the procedures of @xcite .",
    "we first turn off the hall effect during initial evolution to time @xmath177 .",
    "then we turn on the hall effect and run the simulations to @xmath178 , where steady state magnetic configuration fully saturates . in all cases , the saturated field geometry obeys  odd - z \" symmetry ( e.g. , figure 9 of @xcite ) where horizontal components of magnetic field remain the same sign across the disk , and reach maximum around disk midplane . while this symmetry is unphysical for disk wind launching , it is likely an artifact of shearing - box and here we set this issue asidem and @xmath123 , @xcite obtained a physical wind geometry at @xmath179 au with @xmath180 .",
    "we can reproduce this result but we fail to obtain physical symmetry with @xmath108 . ] . because magnetic diffusivities in the disk midplane region are always excessively large at the inner disk , a diffusivity cap @xmath181 for each non - ideal mhd term",
    "is implemented to prevent prohibitively small numerical timestep .",
    "most previous works used @xmath182 .",
    "we use @xmath183 in the runs up to @xmath178 as described before , but then enlarge @xmath181 to @xmath184 and run for another @xmath185 , which appears sufficient for the system to relax to a new state .",
    "we do observe changes in @xmath186 at midplane by up to @xmath187 after enlarging the diffusivity cap , while typically the changes are within @xmath105 , and is much smaller for midplane @xmath188 .",
    "in parallel to simulations that take into account the full dependence of @xmath2 , @xmath1 on @xmath12 ( referred as  full \" ) , we also conduct simulations assuming @xmath92 and @xmath93 , taking the proportional constants from the weak field limit of the full dependence ( referred to as  simple \" ) , and compare the difference between the two sets of runs .",
    "table [ tab : runs ] lists all our quasi-1d simulations .",
    "we also show four main simulation diagnostics at saturation : @xmath189 is the plasma @xmath117 at disk midplane ( based on total field strength ) , @xmath190 is the vertically integrated dimensionless shakura - sunyaev @xmath191 based on maxwell stress @xmath192 , @xmath193 is proportional to the torque exerted at the wind base @xmath194 , and @xmath195 is the mass loss rate measured at the top of the simulation box ( single - sided ) .",
    "the wind base @xmath194 is defined as the location where rotation transitions from sub - keplerian to super - keplerian ( in practice , we choose it to be the first minimum of @xmath196 as one varies @xmath162 from boundary towards midplane , as discussed in b14 ) .",
    "all aspects of these diagnostic quantities have been discussed in the literature , and this table mainly serves as a reference .      in figure",
    "[ fig : simulation ] , we show the simulation results with @xmath107 m , @xmath120 and @xmath180 at 1 au and 5 au , respectively .",
    "the top panels show the vertical profiles of magnetic field strength in code units , where plasma @xmath124 at midplane corresponds to @xmath197 . as usual",
    ", toroidal field is the dominant component , and it maintains a relatively flat profile across the disk midplane because of excessively low ionization level there ( lack of charge carriers can not support current ) .",
    "we also mark the threshold field strength @xmath3 at which @xmath2 changes sign , which is computed based on the diffusivity table directly .",
    "we have verified that the line shapes follow exactly the corresponding curves shown in figure [ fig : abundance ] in logarithmic scale . in linear scale , the minimum of @xmath3 at @xmath198 is the most prominent feature , and we see that the saturated field strength from our simulations ( dominated by toroidal field ) matches closely to the minimum value of @xmath3 . on the other hand , simulations assuming @xmath92 yield stronger field around disk midplane as a result of the hsi .",
    "this comparison clearly shows that @xmath3 provides an approximate upper limit that magnetic field strength can grow , resulting in pre - matured saturation of the hsi .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ fig : simulation ] show the elsasser number profiles for the three non - ideal mhd effects .",
    "we first see that the locations where @xmath199 in the top panels have negative hall elsasser number @xmath114 seen in the bottom panels . in other regions where @xmath2 is positive , we also see that both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are reduced compared to the  simple \" case assuming @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which is due to a ) . weaker magnetic field strength and b ) .",
    "reduction of @xmath200 and @xmath1 towards stronger field .",
    "we also performed simulations with reduced grain abundance ( @xmath107 m and @xmath123 ) .",
    "in this case , however , the threshold field strength is much stronger , and we find that simulations using full diffusivity dependence on @xmath12 yield identical results as assuming @xmath92 , @xmath93 scalings .",
    "the latter was adopted in @xcite , and hence his results were unaffected .",
    "this is because with reduced grain abundance , the threshold field strength is much stronger ( as seen in figure [ fig : abundance ] ) , and exceeds the strength that can be attained from field amplification by the hsi .    increasing the net vertical magnetic flux naturally leads to stronger wind , with larger wind torque and higher mass outflow rate , as listed in table [ tab : runs ] .",
    "other than the wind being stronger , we find that the general phenomenologies discussed above hold exactly the same way , where field amplification by the hsi saturates at weaker field strength when full dependence of diffusivities on @xmath12 is considered",
    ".    field amplification by the hsi always weakens with increasing grain abundance as a result of enhanced resistive dissipation .",
    "this is already evident by comparing the effectively grain - free simulations of @xcite and the simulations of @xcite with @xmath107 m and @xmath123 , where the former showed extreme level of field amplification around the disk midplane that approach equipartition field strength , and the latter only found modest level of amplification .",
    "the trend continues when increasing dust - to - gas ratio to @xmath108 , and assuming simple @xmath92 , @xmath93 dependence , midplane field strength is already reduced by a factor of @xmath201 .",
    "our simulations show that a further reduction is achieved when full dependence of diffusivities on @xmath12 is considered .",
    "this further reduction in field strength is better viewed when plotting the maxwell stress ( @xmath175 ) profiles , which depends quadratically on field strength .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : maxwell ] , and the vertically integrated values @xmath190 are listed in table [ tab : runs ] .",
    "overall , our studies show that whether the full dependence on field strength needs to be taken into account when small grains are abundant ( or effectively , @xmath140 defined in ( [ eq : g ] ) ) . reducing grain abundance leads to larger threshold field strength @xmath3 , and and in the mean time higher level of field amplification by the hsi .",
    "it turns out that the former increases much faster , and the effect studied in this paper becomes essentially irrelevant when @xmath154 .",
    "we have conducted a comprehensive study on the dependence of magnetic diffusivities on magnetic field strength in the presence of charged grains with application to ppds .",
    "ohmic resistivity @xmath202 is always independent of field strength .",
    "the hall and ambipolar diffusivities @xmath2 and @xmath1 obey simple asymptotic relations @xmath92 and @xmath93 in both weak field regime where @xmath50 , and very strong field regime where @xmath102 , while show complex dependence in between ( see figure [ fig : analytic_diff ] ) .",
    "in particular , when relation ( [ eq : sign ] ) is satisfied ( easily achieved when @xmath15 falls below @xmath41 due to the presence of charged grains ) , @xmath2 changes sign towards strong field , accompanied by reduction of ad .",
    "the threshold field strength @xmath3 beyond which @xmath2 changes sign largely depends the ratio @xmath203 , and is weaker when @xmath203 is smaller ( e.g. , charged grains more dominant ) .",
    "similarly , more abundant charged grains leads to stronger reduction of @xmath204 between the weak and strong field regimes .    applying to standard mmsn model of ppds with ionization chemistry",
    ", we find that in order for the threshold field @xmath3 to be well below equipartition level , a large amount of small grains are required , as summarized in an empirical condition @xmath140 [ defined in equation ( [ eq : g ] ) ] , which is applicable to a wide range of disk radii .",
    "when the same condition is satisfied , ad is also reduced substantially and may promote the action of the mri in the outer ppds .",
    "we further conducted quasi-1d shearing - box simulations for inner region of ppds including all three non - ideal mhd effects with net vertical field aligned with rotation .",
    "we show that when small grains are abundant , magnetic field amplification due to the hall - shear instability saturates at close to the minimum value of @xmath3 . therefore , besides the fact that abundant small grains limit magnetic field growth by enhancing resistivity , they also affect the gas dynamics in a more complex way by modifying the field - strength dependence of magnetic diffusivities , especially by enabling @xmath2 to change sign towards strong field . on the other hand , with substantial grain growth",
    "( so that @xmath154 ) , the threshold field strength becomes too strong to be accessible via internal mhd processes in ppds , and hence it suffices to simply adopt @xmath157 and @xmath158 in the weak field limit .",
    "our work helps clarify how the presence of grains affects ionization chemistry and magnetic diffusivities in ppds , and hence the general disk dynamics .",
    "this is particularly relevant to the hall effect : inclusion of the hall effect not only makes ppd gas dynamics dependent on the polarity of net vertical magnetic field , but also leads to more sensitive dependence on grain abundance , as compared to the hall - free case of @xcite . in combination with other recent studies , we can identify three regimes on the gas dynamics of inner ppds ( @xmath205 au ) depending on the grain abundance .    * grain - free ( @xmath206 ) : very strong magnetic field amplification by the hsi when @xmath207 @xcite , and bursty behavior at @xmath208 au when @xmath209 @xcite . * modest grain abundance ( @xmath210 ) : modest magnetic field amplification by the hsi when @xmath207 , while horizontal field is reduced to close to zero when @xmath209 @xcite . * high grain abundance ( @xmath140 ) : the hsi saturates due to sign change of @xmath2 at threshold field strength @xmath3 when @xmath207 .",
    "exploration of the hall effect in ppds is still at an early stage .",
    "there are still pressing issues especially concerning the symmetry of disk wind , direction of magnetic flux transport , wind kinematics , etc .",
    "the complexity introduced by grains further adds to the richness of the overall subject of ppd gas dynamics .",
    "conversely , it is well known that grain size and spatial distribution in ppds depends on level of turbulence and global structure of the disk , and evolve with time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the two interrelated aspects are inherent in ppd dynamics , and further call for more in - depth investigations in the future ."
