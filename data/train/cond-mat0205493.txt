    "instability is one of the most important phenomena in strained heteroepitaxial growth , where a thin film of different material is epitaxially deposited on a substrate and the mismatch of lattice constants between film and substrate leads to strain in the grown film .",
    "besides the formation of misfit dislocations and other defects , the strain can be relieved through the process of morphological instability , during which the growth mode of the film is changed from layer - by - layer to three - dimensional island but the film still remains coherent with its substrate .",
    "this dislocation - free morphological instability occurs in a wide range of heteroepitaxial systems , and has been well investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite for single - component materials .    in recent years ,",
    "more attention has been paid to the multi - component strained layers , in particular the binary ( e.g. , si@xmath0ge@xmath1 @xcite ) and pseudo - binary ( e.g. , in@xmath0ga@xmath1as @xcite ) alloys .",
    "since the materials are composed of different kinds of atoms that may not be fully miscible , the compositional inhomogeneities are expected to develop at certain growth conditions .",
    "this alloy segregation instability couples with the morphological instability , resulting in the simultaneous modulations of the surface profile and alloy composition during the epitaxial growth.@xcite another important phenomenon of the heteroepitaxial alloy films is the asymmetry of the stability for compressive and tensile layers . for si@xmath0ge@xmath1 , films grown under compression were observed to be less stable than those under tension,@xcite while for in@xmath0ga@xmath1as the situation is more complicated : whether compressive or tensile films are more stable seems to depend on the material s growth rate .",
    "@xcite compared with single - component films , there is an extra effect on alloy strain due to composition dependence of the film lattice constant .",
    "@xcite the combination of this compositional strain and the film - substrate misfit strain highly influences the stability behaviors of alloy films .",
    "@xcite    some theoretical investigations have been carried out in order to understand the morphological instability of strained multi - component films , and most of them focused on the properties and behaviors of growing layers with deposition flux.@xcite however , the studies of the static film without deposition @xcite are much fewer , although the stability of epitaxial films in the absence of growth is also important from both the theoretical and experimental points of view . using the treatment of thermodynamics ,",
    "glas @xcite has demonstrated that any strained alloy with a static free surface is unstable due to the interplay of morphological and compositional instabilities .",
    "furthermore , as also pointed out by glas , this result is valid provided all the evolution mechanisms are possible , and when the physically relevant mechanism is considered , the unstable state derived thermodynamically may not be kinetically accessible .",
    "this has been verified in the nonequilibrium and dynamical analysis of lonard and desai,@xcite where the stability properties of both the non - growing ( static ) and growing strained alloy films were determined .",
    "stabilization in non - growing film was found to be possible for some parameter values , showing the significance of kinetic evolution process .    in this paper",
    "we apply a nonequilibrium , continuum model in order to study the morphological instability and surface decomposition of binary or pseudo - binary strained non - growing alloy films , i.e. , films without deposition .",
    "the system is assumed to be elastically isotropic and follow the conserved dynamics of phase separation and surface diffusion .",
    "compared with the model of lonard and desai@xcite and other previous work , here we have two crucial considerations which lead to significantly different stability results .",
    "first , due to the fact that the surface phase and bulk phase in a strained film are intimately coupled with each other , we take into account the total free energy of the system , not just the surface state and energy as used before.@xcite second , the film elastic moduli ( both the young s modulus @xmath2 and shear modulus @xmath3 ) are considered to be composition - dependent , which deeply affects the stability properties . presenting the linear analysis on early evolution of surface profile and composition , we derive the stability conditions for non - growing film as well as stability diagrams for various material parameters appropriate to realistic systems .    in sec .",
    "[ secii ] , we describe the continuum model with conserved dynamics and present the mechanical equilibrium equation for the elasticity of this film system .",
    "the linear stability analysis is carried out in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] , resulting in the characteristic equation for perturbation growth rate .",
    "the results related to the stability conditions and diagrams are shown in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] , and the discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "we consider a strained alloy system composed of a semi - infinite substrate occupying the region @xmath4 and a a@xmath5b@xmath6 binary or pseudo - binary alloy film in the region @xmath7 , where @xmath8 represents the surface height variable . the film - substrate interface located at @xmath9 is assumed to be planar and remain coherent without generating any misfit dislocation . in this heteroepitaxial system ,",
    "the misfit strain caused by the difference between the lattice constant of the film @xmath10 and that of the substrate @xmath11 is characterized by @xmath12 .",
    "thus , @xmath13 or @xmath14 implies a strained film under compression or tension , respectively . to describe the composition profile of the film , we use a continuous variable @xmath15 which is defined only for @xmath16 and",
    "is proportional to the local difference in the concentrations of two constituents .",
    "corresponding to an alloy composition @xmath17 , its average value @xmath18 is equal to @xmath19 .",
    "here we focus on the symmetric mixture , i.e. , @xmath20 alloy , for which the spinodal decomposition theory can be well applied , and then we have @xmath21 in what follows . due to the atomic size difference between @xmath22 and @xmath23 species ,",
    "the film lattice parameter @xmath10 is composition - dependent and the solute expansion coefficient @xmath24 @xcite is defined to measure the compositional strain .",
    "assume that the thin film has been grown under ultra - high vacuum condition , e.g. , in a molecular - beam epitaxy ( mbe ) system , and then the evaporation and re - condensation on film surface are negligible .",
    "furthermore , we also neglect the interdiffusion between film and substrate as well as the diffusion and compositional relaxation in the bulk film , since the bulk atomic mobility is much smaller than the mobility at the surface in typical epitaxial growth .",
    "thus , the dynamics of morphological and compositional evolution is dominated by the surface diffusion and surface decomposition processes , and should be conserved .    for the evolution of surface profile , the surface diffusion mechanism leads to @xmath25 while to measure the time - dependence of concentration field at the surface @xmath26@xmath27 , we apply the conserved dynamics : @xmath28 note that in eq .",

    "our theoretical results ( for the case of @xmath145 , e.g. , stability diagram like fig . [ fig - b1 + ] ) , obtained from the surface diffusion mechanism , can explain this temperature dependent phenomenon without the introduction of an energy barrier .",
