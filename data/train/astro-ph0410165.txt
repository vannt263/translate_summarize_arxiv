    "early investigators studied the spatial distribution of galaxies because they hoped to learn about the structure of the universe on the largest scales .",
    "their influential work was superseded , in the end , by its competition .",
    "problems began with the demonstration that galaxies contained only a small fraction of the matter in the universe .",
    "galaxy formation remained too poorly understood to quell doubts about how faithfully galaxies traced underlying distribution of dark matter .",
    "other observations improved  gravitational lensing , peculiar velocities , intergalactic absorption lines , and so on  and seemed easier to relate to matter fluctuations .",
    "computers became fast enough to predict the evolution of the large - scale matter distribution from the the initial conditions that microwave - background missions were measuring with increasing precision . as it became clear that the simulations and observations agreed remarkably well , most researchers concluded that the large - scale structure of the universe could be understood completely as the product of gravitational instability amplifying small inflationary perturbations .",
    "galaxies , once believed to be the primary constituent of the universe , came to be seen as small test particles swept into ever larger structures by converging dark matter flows .",
    "the spatial distribution of galaxies remains interesting because it can teach us about galaxy formation .",
    "galaxy formation must be closely related to larger process of gravitational structure formation , since the formation of a galaxy begins with gas streaming into a massive potential well and ends with stars drifting in the cosmic flow .",
    "lessons from 20 years of numerical investigations into structure formation should therefore carry over to the analysis of galaxy clustering .",
    "one example is the known positive correlation between clustering strength and mass for virialized dark matter halos .",
    "since galaxies reside in dark matter halos , their clustering strength provides an indication of the mass of the halos that contain them .",
    "the resulting mass estimate depends on the assumptions that the microwave background and other observations have given us reliable estimates of cosmological parameters and of the initial matter power - spectrum , that numerical simulations can correctly trace the evolution of the matter distribution , at least for moderate densities , and that no process can significantly separate baryons from dark matter on mpc scales  assumptions that are at least as plausible as those behind competing techniques for mass estimation .",
    "another example is the evolution in the clustering strength of a population of galaxies once it has formed .",
    "this is driven solely by gravity and is easy to predict from numerical simulations .",
    "comparing the clustering of ( say ) galaxies in the local universe and those at high redshift can therefore suggest or rule out possible links between them .",
    "few other methods are as useful for unifying into evolutionary sequences the galaxy populations we observe at different look - back times . an excellent review of the history of these techniques has been written by giavalisco ( 2002 ; pp 620 - 624 ) .",
    "this paper has two aims .",
    "the first is to present measurements of the clustering of uv - selected star - forming galaxies in a redshift range @xmath2 that is only partially explored .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes the way we obtained our data ,   [ sec : methods ] describes and justifies the techniques we used to estimate the spatial clustering in our galaxy samples , and ",
    "[ sec : results ] presents our estimates of the galaxy correlation function at redshifts @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",

    "( 2002 ) and 4 times larger than the areas analyzed by giavalisco & dickinson ( 2001 ) and ouchi et al .",

    "all redshifts were measured with the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the keck telescopes .",
    "the number of redshifts in each field was determined by the number of clear nights that were allocated .",
    "photometric candidates were selected for spectroscopy more - or - less at random , but in one way the selection was far from random : spectroscopic objects in each field were constrained to fit together in a non - interfering way on one of a small number of multislit masks .",
    "this introduced artificial angular clustering to the spectroscopic samples , particularly in fields where our image s size significantly exceeded the spectrograph s @xmath67 field - of - view . in some cases the artificial angular clustering",
    "was increased by our desire to obtain particularly dense spectroscopic sampling in some parts of an image , e.g. , near a background qso .",
    "table  [ tab : fields ] lists the number of bm , bx , and lbg photometric candidates and spectroscopic galaxies in each field .",
    "the field - to - field variations in the number of photometric candidates per square arcminute were caused primarily by differences in exposure times , seeing , sky brightness , telescope plus instrumental throughput , and so on , from one run to the next .",
    "recall that we used many different telescopes and cameras during our imaging survey . the expected variations in intrinsic surface density ( also shown in the table , and calculated for galaxies with bias @xmath68 as described in   [ sec : angularmethods ] below )",
    "are significantly smaller .",
    "we estimated the angular correlation functions from the lists of photometric candidates . inferring a comoving correlation length @xmath69 from the measured angular clustering required an estimate of the objects redshift distribution .",
    "for this we took the measured redshift distributions of the spectroscopic samples .",
    "since the spectroscopic samples are large ",
    "several hundred for the bx and lbg criteria , nearly 100 for bm ",
    "random fluctuations are unlikely to have given redshift distributions to them that are significantly different from those of the parent photometric samples .",
    "we were able to measure a redshift for only @xmath70% of the objects we observed spectroscopically , however , and it is therefore possible that various systematics ( e.g. , difficulties measuring spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies in certain redshift ranges ) could have caused the spectroscopic and photometric samples to have somewhat different redshift distributions .",
    "repeated observations of a subset of the initial spectroscopic failures show that these objects have the same redshift distribution as the initial successes , implying that any systematics are not severe .      to help us",
    "interpret our observations , we refered at times the gif - lcdm numerical simulation of structure formation in a cosmology with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "this gravity - only simulation contained @xmath76 particles with mass @xmath77 in a periodic cube of comoving side - length @xmath78 mpc , used a softening length of @xmath79 comoving kpc , and was released publicly , along with its halo catalogs , by frenk et al .",
    "astro - ph/0007362 .",
    "further details can be found in jenkins et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and kauffmann et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . since the gif - lcdm cosmology is consistent with the wilkinson microwave - anisotropy probe results ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , and since modeling the gravitational growth of perturbations on large ( @xmath34 mpc ) scales is not numerically challenging , we will assume that the growth of structure found in this simulation closely mirrors the growth of structure in the actual universe .    for our purposes",
    "the most interesting aspect of the simulation is the spatial distribution of virialized `` halos '' , or overdensities with @xmath80 , since these deep potential wells are the sites where galaxies can form from cooling gas .",
    "the public halo catalogs were created , by the gif team , by running a halo - finding algorithm at various time steps in the simulation .",
    "we will say that all the halos identified by the algorithm at time - step @xmath81 ( say ) had @xmath81 as their time of identification .",
    "correlation functions for halos at the time of identification were calculated directly from the public halo catalogs . in subsequent time - steps these halos",
    "were progressively displaced by gravity .",
    "some grew ; others were destroyed as they were subsumed into larger structures .",
    "any galaxies within the halos would be likely to survive intact , however , and it is interesting to trace the expected evolution in their correlation function over time . to do this , we assumed that the galaxies in a halo would be displaced by gravity by the same amount , and in the same direction , as the halo s most bound particle .",
    "if @xmath82 denotes the set of particles that were the most bound particle in a halo at @xmath83 , we assumed that the correlation function at time @xmath84 of the galaxies that lay within halos identified at time @xmath83 would be roughly equal to the correlation function of particles @xmath82 at time @xmath84 . at spatial separations that are large",
    "compared to the typical halo radius , the expected evolution of the galaxy correlation function is insensitive to the details of this procedure .",
    "these are the only spatial separations we will consider .",
    "our focus on large spatial scales also justifies our ignoring the possibility of galaxy mergers .",
    "although mergers can strongly affect the correlation function on small scales , on large scales the effect is more subtle .",
    "it can be understood as follows . at time @xmath84 , the galaxies identified at time @xmath83 will be found in halos with a range of masses , and their large - scale correlation function will be a weighted average of the correlation functions of the halos . since the weighting depends on typical number of descendant galaxies in halos of each mass , and since halos with different masses have different correlation functions , the large - scale correlation function of descendant galaxies will be altered by mergers if the merger frequency depends on halo mass . in practice , however , the difference in correlation functions between the more massive and less massive halos that host the descendants is not enormous , and as a result the merger frequency would have to be an implausibly strong function of halo mass to alter the descendant correlation functions on large scales in a significant way .",
    "two approaches will be used to estimate the clustering strength . the first approach , which is standard , relies almost exclusively on the angular positions of the galaxies .",
    "the second relies almost exclusively on the galaxies measured redshifts .",
    "these approaches exploit different aspects of our data and are subject to different systematics .",
    "the level of agreement between them provides an important test of our conclusions robustness .",
    "this section describes and justifies the two approaches .",
    "readers interested primarily in our scientific results may wish to skip ahead to   [ sec : results ] .",
    "the observed clustering of galaxies on the plane of the sky is related to the galaxies three - dimensional correlation function in a straightforward way .",
    "let @xmath85 denote a galaxy s redshift and @xmath86 denote its angular position .",
    "@xmath86 is written in bold face because two numbers ( e.g. , right ascension and declination ) are required to specify the galaxy s angular position .",
    "if @xmath87 is the probability that a galaxy at known position @xmath88 has a neighbor at position @xmath89 , then elementary identities show that the probability that a galaxy at angular position @xmath90 will have a neighbor at angular position @xmath91 is @xmath92 observations indicate that the reduced correlation function is well approximated by an isotropic power law , @xmath93,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath94 parametrize the shape of the power law and @xmath95 is the distance between @xmath89 and @xmath88 .",
    "this implies , in the circumstances of interest to us , that the reduced angular correlation function will also be a power law , @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "if the angular separation @xmath98 between the galaxies is small , @xmath99 , and if the comoving correlation length @xmath69 does not change significantly from the front to the back of the survey , then @xmath100 ^ 2 \\label{eq : alimber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see , e.g. , totsuji & kihara 1969 ) where @xmath101 is the survey selection function , @xmath102 is the beta function in the convention of press et al .",

    "our estimates of @xmath110 in different angular bins will be based on the landy - szalay ( 1993 ) estimator @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the observed number of unique galaxy pairs with separation @xmath113 , @xmath114 is the number of unique pairs with separation in the same range between the observed galaxy catalog and a galaxy catalog with random angular positions , and @xmath115 is the number of unique pairs in the random catalog with separations in the same range . in practice",
    "we reduce the noise in the random pair counts by creating random catalogs with many times more objects than the data catalogs ( @xmath116 ) , calculating @xmath117 and @xmath118 , then multiplying @xmath117 and @xmath118 by @xmath119 and @xmath120 $ ] , respectively .",
    "unless fluctuations on the size of our typical field - of - view are negligible , the number of detected galaxies in any field will be somewhat higher or lower than in a fair sample of the universe , and the number of galaxies in the field s ideal random catalog would therefore be lower or higher than the observed number . as a result",
    "the values @xmath117 and @xmath118 that we calculate with our approach will be incorrect to some degree . in a single field",
    "this can make the clustering appear stronger or weaker than it truly is , but when many fields are averaged it tends to make the observed clustering appear artificially weak .",
    "this can be shown as follows .",
    "assume that the observed mean density in a field differs from the global average by the unknown factor @xmath121 , i.e. , @xmath122 , and let @xmath117 and @xmath118 be the pair counts calculated from scaling the random catalogs to the observed density .",
    "one might guess that the estimator of equation  [ eq : landyszalay ] ought to have @xmath117 and @xmath118 replaced by values corrected to the true mean density , i.e. , by @xmath123 and @xmath124 , and indeed hamilton ( 1993 , ",
    "3 ) has shown that the estimator @xmath125 is equal to the true angular correlation function on average , @xmath126 this equation does not help us directly , since we do not know @xmath127 and can not calculate @xmath128 , but it does show that the estimator @xmath129 must be biased : @xmath130 where @xmath131 and the approximation assumes the weak clustering ( @xmath132 ) limit .",
    "it is therefore customary to estimate @xmath110 by adding a constant @xmath133 to the calculated values @xmath134 .",
    "the constant @xmath135 depends on the unknown values of @xmath127 in the observed field or fields and can not be calculated exactly . if @xmath136 , so that field - to - field fluctuations are in the linear regime and have a nearly gaussian distribution , and if our data are drawn from @xmath137 independent fields with measured pair counts @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 , then the value of @xmath135 appropriate to a given angular bin in our data set will have a variance of @xmath141 \\\\                 & \\simeq & \\frac{1}{rr_{\\rm tot}^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n 2\\sigma_i^4 dd_i^2 \\label{eq : var_i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] around its expectation value @xmath142 here @xmath143 is the sum over all fields of the random pair counts in the chosen angular bin . in practice @xmath144 and @xmath145 depend very weakly on which bin is chosen . below we will take @xmath144 at @xmath146 as our best guess at the correction @xmath135 .",
    "when it matters we will discuss the effect of the uncertainty in @xmath135 .",
    "we use two approaches to estimate the size of the uncertainty @xmath147 in the mean galaxy density of the @xmath148th field .",
    "since @xmath149 it can be estimated numerically as @xmath150 if @xmath151 is known ( infante 1994 ; roche & eales 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately the iterative approach suggested by equations  [ eq : actualestimator ] and  [ eq : rocheeales ] can be unstable , at least when the correlation function slope is allowed to vary : a large value of @xmath134 will imply a large correction @xmath152 , which implies an even larger @xmath134 and even larger correction , and so on .",
    "the instability is undoubtedly worse for large images , where the estimate of the integral constraint correction for one iteration is completely dominated by the assumed correction from the previous .",
    "we were unable to use equation  [ eq : rocheeales ] as anything other than a consistency check .",
    "a more robust estimate of @xmath152 follows from theoretical considerations .",

    "59.3 ) can be derived from the fit to the galaxy correlation function .",
    "this approach also requires an iterative solution , since the correction @xmath152 to @xmath110 depends on @xmath110 , but the advantage is that the assumed size of large - scale fluctuations is anchored in reality by our requirement that the slope of the correlation function match other observations on very large scales .",
    "the discussion so far assumes that we will know the precise shape of the selection function @xmath101 .",
    "in fact this is not true , and uncertainty in the true shape of our selection function is a source of error in the derived values of @xmath69 . means that errors in @xmath101 alter the inferred value of @xmath94 as well .",
    "we will neglect this small effect . ]",
    "a larger width for the selection function means that projection effects are stronger , and therefore implies a larger value of @xmath69 for given angular clustering ( see equation  [ eq : alimber ] ) . if the selection function is a gaussian with mean @xmath170 and standard deviation @xmath171 , and if the weak redshift variations of @xmath172 and @xmath173 can be ignored , then the constant @xmath107 in equation  [ eq : alimber ] is proportional to @xmath174 , and the implied value of @xmath69 is proportional to @xmath175",

    "the relative uncertainty in @xmath171 is therefore approximately @xmath181% for the lbg and bx samples and @xmath182% for the bm sample , which implies @xmath183% uncertainty in @xmath69 for the lbg and bx samples and @xmath184% uncertainty in the bm sample .",
    "variations of the selection function from one field to the next ( owing , for example , to differences in the depth of the data or to systematic errors in our photometric zero points ) are another source of concern , especially at the redshifts @xmath185 where galaxies colors are insensitive to redshift and small color errors mimic large redshift differences .",
    "suppose for simplicity that all fields have the same number of photometric candidates , let the rms width of the selection function in the @xmath148th field be written @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the mean width among all fields , and let the mean redshift of the selection function be written @xmath188 where @xmath170 is the mean redshift among all fields .",
    "then the rms width of the total selection function @xmath189^{1/2 } = s[1+{\\rm var}(\\delta)+{\\rm var}(\\epsilon)]^{1/2},\\ ] ] exceeds the value @xmath187 that should be used in determining @xmath107 .",
    "since we will ( by necessity ) use the total selection function in estimating @xmath69 , our estimates will be biased high .",
    "systematic errors in our zero points are unlikely to be larger than @xmath190 , and variations in photometric depth will at most change our characteristic color uncertainties from @xmath191 to @xmath192 magnitudes .",
    "the measured variations in galaxy redshift with @xmath7 color ( see , e.g. , adelberger et al .",
    "2004 ) imply ( a ) that zero point errors with @xmath190 will shift the mean redshifts of galaxies that satisfy the lbg , bx , and bm selection criteria by @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 , respectively , and ( b ) that increasing the photometric uncertainty from @xmath196 to @xmath197 will increase the widths of the lbg , bx , and bm selection functions by @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath199% .",

    "we chose to limit each sample to a fixed range of apparent magnitudes , @xmath393 , on the grounds that this resulted in a similar comoving density in each redshift bin .",
    "different magnitude limits would have resulted in different correlation lengths .",
    "readers should be aware that the numbers we give are appropriate to the samples as we have defined them , not to the general galaxy population at high redshifts .",

    "( 1998 ) , giavalisco & dickinson ( 2000 ) , porciani & giavalisco ( 2002 ) , and others .",
    "although the estimated masses were derived solely from the galaxy clustering , they seem reasonable on other grounds",
    ". they can not be much higher .",
    "the number density of halos would be lower than the number density of lbgs , for example , if the halo mass were greater than @xmath399 .",
    "such large halo masses would be possible only if significantly more than one lbg resided in the typical halo , and that is something that our observations rule out (   [ sec : correspondence ] ) . nor",
    "can they be much lower .",
    "the halos that contain lbgs would not have enough baryons to form the median lbg stellar mass of roughly @xmath400 ( shapley et al .",
    "2001 times lower than the value shapley et al . calculated for an imf with a salpeter slope between @xmath401 and @xmath402 .",
    "their assumed salpeter imf is probably unrealistic since the imf in the solar neighborhood is known to flatten near @xmath403 and eventually turn over at lower masses .",
    "see leitherer ( 1998 ) or renzini ( 2004 ) for further discussion . ] ) unless their total mass were greater than about @xmath404 .",
    "we should mention in passing that our best - fit halo masses seem to imply that only a small fraction of the baryons in the halos are associated with the observed galaxies .",
    "for example , the best - fit mass threshold of @xmath394 for lbgs corresponds to a median total mass of @xmath405 and median baryonic mass of @xmath406 ( for @xmath407 , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , roughly ten times larger than the observed stellar masses of lbgs . since the @xmath408 supernovae that explode during the assembly of the typical lbg s stellar mass will eject roughly @xmath409 of metals ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 ) , enough to enrich at most @xmath410 of gas to lbgs typical metallicities of @xmath411 ( pettini et al . 2002 ) , their observed interstellar gas can not contain a large fraction of the remaining baryons .",
    "these baryons need not be associated with other objects in the halo , however .",
    "they may be locked in dim stars that formed in previous episodes of star - formation ( e.g. , papovich , dickinson , & ferguson 2001 ) , or may have been heated by various processes to undetectably high temperatures .",
    "the latter is presumably the case for nearby galaxies , whose ratios of mass in stars and gas to total mass are usually also smaller than the wmap value @xmath407 . the milky way , for example , has a total mass of @xmath412 ( zaritsky 1999 ; wilkinson & evans 1999 ) and a mass in gas and stars of only @xmath413 ( k. freeman 2004 , private communication ) , yet few would assert that its missing baryons belong to another galaxy in its halo .",
    "after establishing plausible total masses for the halos associated with the galaxies , we considered some of the implications .",
    "our arguments were not new ( see , e.g. , moustakas & somerville 2002 , martini & weinberg 2001 , adelberger et al .",
    "they seemed worth revisiting only because our knowledge of the cosmogony , of the local universe , and of high - redshift galaxies has improved so much in the last few years .",
    "we began by estimating the completeness of our surveys from a comparison of the galaxies number densities to the number densities of halos with similar clustering strength ( figure  [ fig : nhalo ] ) .",
    "similar number densities would imply that almost all of the most massive halos contained a galaxy that satisfied our selection criteria ; a much lower galaxy number density would imply that most of the galaxies in massive halos are missed by our survey . defining @xmath273 as the ratio of galaxy to halo number density",
    ", we found rough @xmath288 limits of @xmath414 , @xmath415 , and @xmath416 .",
    "these limits were derived from the clustering at radii @xmath360 comoving mpc .",
    "the clustering on smaller scales , sensitive to the possible presence of more than one galaxy in a halo , implies that the upper limits on @xmath417 and @xmath418 should be revised downwards to @xmath419 .",
    "the data appear consistent with the claim of franx et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that our selection criteria find roughly half of the most massive galaxies at @xmath185 .",
    "a completeness of order @xmath306% seems plausible to us for other reasons as well .",
    "shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimate a lifetime for the typical lbg of @xmath420 yr , for example , which implies that the typical lbg will be bright enough for us to detect for only about half of the time that elapsed between the survey selection limits of @xmath421 and @xmath422 .",
    "we considered next the way the clustering of the galaxies would evolve ( figure  [ fig : r0_vs_z ] ) .",
    "analysis of the gif - lcdm simulation suggested that the correlation length of lbg descendants would be similar by @xmath31 to the correlation length of galaxies in the bx sample and by @xmath30 to the correlation length of galaxies in the bm sample .",
    "the spatial clustering is therefore consistent with the idea that we are seeing the same population at all three redshifts , though the selection criteria s @xmath423% incompleteness leaves room for the populations to be distinct and the difference in stellar masses between the lbg ( @xmath400 ) and bx ( @xmath424 ; steidel et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) samples may not be consistent with continuous star - formation at observed rates through the elapsed time . turning our attention to lower redshifts",
    ", we found that at @xmath27 our descendants clustering would most closely match the observed clustering of galaxies that are red and bright and have early - type spectra ( figure  [ fig : z1gals ] ) .",
    "by @xmath210 the estimated clustering of the descendants suggested elliptical galaxies as the most likely counterparts ( figure  [ fig : z0gals ] ) .",
    "the correspondence is especially hard to dispute for the descendants of the brightest and most strongly clustered galaxies in the high - redshift samples .",
    "one conclusion seems difficult to escape : the descendants of the galaxies in our samples must have significantly larger stellar masses than their high - redshift forebears .",
    "only @xmath425% of the total stellar mass in the local universe is found in galaxies with stellar masses smaller than @xmath426 ( kauffmann et al .",

    "the increase in stellar mass from @xmath185 to @xmath26 could have been produced by ongoing star formation or by mergers .",
    "our results at redshift @xmath27 may favor the latter , but in any case our findings are strongly inconsistent with traditional notions of monolithic collapse",

    "2005 ] galaxies with similarly extreme properties are not a negligible component of the high redshift universe .",
    "the shape of the @xmath431 m background implies that up to a third ( cowie , barger , & kneib 2002 ) of all stars could have formed in objects with star - formation rates greater than @xmath432 ; halos at @xmath313 with the large masses @xmath433 implied by @xmath434@xmath435 mpc contain in total almost @xmath199% as many baryons as the more numerous and smaller halos with @xmath436 that contain lbgs ; objects with stellar masses @xmath437 contain nearly @xmath318% of all stars in the local universe ( kauffmann et al .",
