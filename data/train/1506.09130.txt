    "the basic model of a pulsar had long been recognized as a perfect conductor ( neutron star ) rotating with an angular velocity @xmath1 in a hiper magnetic field @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "considering the rotational axis and the magnetic axis both aligned in the same sense , charged particles in the neutron star are driven by the magnetic force to the surface according to their signs , with electrons towards the polar regions and ions towrds the equatorial region .",
    "this is the faraday unipolar induction that operates homopolar generator , which extracts the energy of a conducting rigid rotator .",
    "due to its rotation in the presence of a magnetic field , the conducting pulsar surface is not an equipotential surface , contrary to the static case .",
    "if the pulsar were surrounded by a vacuum , the separated charges would accumulate on the pulsar surface by their signs , and a counter electric field would build up inside the neutron star to counteract the magnetic force .",
    "a steady state surface charge distribution or potential distribution would be reached when the two forces inside the pulsar cancel out , and there would be a quadrupole electric field in space surrounding the neutron star . the unipolar induction would cease to operate then .",
    "however , the seminal work of @xcite noted that such a vacuum configuration was unstable , and there had to be a pulsar magnetosphere to channel the surface charges . as a result ,",
    "the counter electric field inside the pulsar would be small , and the unipolar induction would continue to operate .",
    "the steady state potential distribution on the pulsar surface would be uploaded to the equipotential magnetic field lines of the magnetosphere .",
    "quite often , field line breaking near the pulsar is invoked to provide an electron - positron background pair plasma to fill the magnetosphere .",
    "the equation of motion of a charge particle in the magnetosphere is given by    @xmath3    with the plasma inertia on the left side and plasma pressure , collision , gravitational force on the right side neglected , comparing to the hiper magnetic and electric fields , the macroscopic structure of the magnetosphere is determined only by the balance between electric and magnetic forces , which is the force - free field model @xcite with    @xmath4    although plasma inertia and plasma pressure are neglected in the macroscopic description , these terms in the equation of motion give rise charged particle gyro motion about magnetic field lines and transverse drift motions across field lines in the microscopic single particle description @xcite . as a result of these drifts , macroscopic drift currents and plasma flows , corresponding to the guiding center motions ,",
    "are generated in eq .",
    "[ eqno1 ] , as will be addressed in sec.3 .    with the surface charges having ready access to the field lines , plasma density will be high enough in the magnetosphere such that plasma conductivity @xmath5 tends to be infinite ,",
    "the ohm law reads    @xmath6    for a quasi - neutral normal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) plasma , the plasma velocity @xmath7 in eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] amounts to the center of mass velocity . for a charge separated plasma , this equation coincides with eq .",
    "[ eqno1 ] other than an overall fator of the space charge density @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , this does not mean that eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] is redundant , since it describes the magnetosphere in terms of velocities while eq .",
    "[ eqno1 ] does it in terms of fields .",
    "these two descriptions are then coupled through the space charge densities .",
    "probably induced by the lighthouse scenario of pulsar beacons , the pulsar magnetosphere is often interpreted as such that the magnetic field lines are rigidly anchored on the pulsar surface .",
    "the entire magnetosphere thus corotates with the pulsar at its angular velocity , and the charge separated plasma is being dragged along with it .",
    "although for an aligned rotator and under axisymmetry , it is indistinguishable whether or not the magnetosphere is rotating . nevertheless , in an oblique rotator , it could generate the lighthouse beacons and magnetic dipole radiation . in this scenario ,",
    "the rotating magnetic field @xmath2 drags the plasma generating a rigid rotor velocity @xmath7 . applying this rotating plasma velocity @xmath7",
    "back to a stationary frame in space , and considering the magnetic field @xmath2 be stationary , which is indistinguishable from a rotating one , eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] then gives the magnetospheric electric field @xmath9 in the stationary frame .",
    "we remark that only under the axisymmetric aligned rotator case that the magnetic field can be considered stationary and/or rotating by option .",
    "so the plasma velocity @xmath7 is an input parameter in eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] , the driving energy is the rotating magnetic field , and the electric field @xmath9 is the response which is called the rotation induced electric field .",
    "some authors introduce a non - rotation induced longitudinal field @xmath10 by taking into consideration of the interstellar plasma potential , or by considering the centrifugal outflow at the light cylinder ( lc ) @xcite .",
    "other authors have considered a very stringent supply of positive charges from the pulsar surface , due to probably the surface physics of neutron star , and proposed that vacuum gaps could be formed separating the charged regions from the pulsar surface and/or separating the charged regions from each other @xcite .    in this corotating magnetic field model ,",
    "the unipolar induction in the neutron star is clearly decoupled from the magnetosphere .",
    "the magnetic dipole radiation , the angular momentum outflow of the stellar winds , and the current loop in the presence of @xmath10 are attributed to the braking torque on the pulsar indirectly through the general energy conservation principle .",
    "however , the use of the energy conservation principle implies a direct coupling with the neutron star , which is not reflected in this scenario . as a matter of fact ,",
    "if the magnetosphere field lines are anchored on the pulsar surface , the ( dipole ) magnetic field inside the pulsar will be rotating as well .",
    "consequently , there is no relative rotation between the pulsar and the magnetic field inside .",
    "for this reason , there will be no unipolar induction as well .",
    "as a matter of fact , a steady state magnetosphere decoupled from the pulsar implies that the emission problem of the beacons @xcite can be constructed from the equilibrium magnetosphere .",
    "although the validity of separating equilibrium and emission into two different issues can not be disproved , this approach could have over simplified the pulsar dynamics . recently ,",
    "a time dependent description of magnetosphere where the plasma equations are coupled to the maxwell equations to account for induction effects .",
    "this broader approach has been adopted to study the formation of magnetosphere current sheets @xcite , and the linear instabilities in magnetosphere that could be responsable for emissions @xcite .",
    "to overcome the rotation ambiguities of plasma velocity and magnetic field , we consider the magnetic field @xmath2 be stationary in space , and the electric field @xmath9 is uploaded to the equipotential field lines of the magnetosphere according to the potential distribution on the pulsar surface estblished by the unipolar induction .",
    "this means that the charge separated magnetospheric plasma has a negligible contribution to the electric field there . in this case of stationary magnetic field @xmath2 ,",
    "the driving energy is the uploaded electric field @xmath9 which is the input parameter in eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] , and the plasma velocity @xmath7 is the response .",
    "the magnetosphere is directly coupled to the unipolar induction of the pulsar .",
    "the charge separation flow inside the pulsar generates a current .",
    "the interaction of this current with the magnetic field produces a direct braking torque in addition to the contributions of dipole radiation and stellar winds which slow down the rotation rate . finally , we remark that magnetic field is a real physical quantity , while magnetic field line is only a physical concept derived from the field line equation to help visualize the action of magnetic field .",
    "it is rather unphysical to consider field lines being rigidly attached to the pulsar surface corotating with it .",
    "the notion of a rotating magnetosphere is probably cultivated in the oblique rotator case , where the magnetosphere is seen to rotate obliquely about the pulsar rotational axis . as obliqueness goes to zero , we then have an aligned rotator . for an oblique rotator",
    ", we choose to phrase the magnetosphere as wobbling ( not rotating ) about the rotational axis .",
    "consequently , as the obliqueness goes to zero , the magnetosphere stops to wobble and becomes stationary in space .    here , in this paper , we reconsider the @xcite analysis of charge separated plasmas .",
    "in particular , there are two inconsistencies in their work .",
    "the first inconsistency is the space charge density expression which is incompatible with the curvature of the closed ion magnetic field lines near the pulsar . to resolve this inconsistency",
    ", they resorted to a corotating electron cloud above the closed magnetic field lines .",
    "the second one is the introduction of the far zone quasi - neutral interstellar plasma potential to the near zone pulsar magnetosphere to draw plasma outflows in the open field lines .",
    "the field line that has the potential of the interstellar plasma is the critical field line with no charge flow .",
    "this interstellar emf is inconsistent to the @xmath11 plasma condition in the magnetosphere .",
    "actually , many publications in recent decades have concentrated on the pulsar equation itself without mentioning neither the question of space charge density nor the condition of the critical field line .",
    "these simplifications are equivalent to considering the pulsar magnetosphere as filled with a quasi - neutral normal plasma instead of a charge separated plasma .",
    "the charge separated plasma in this stationary magnetosphere undergoes an @xmath12 drift which happens to have an angular velocity of the pulsar , instead of being dragged along by the corotating magnetosphere .",
    "as for the plasma outflow , we consider it be driven by plasma drifts , not by interstellar emf . finally , with a stationary magnetosphere in space , coupled to the unipolar induction in the pulsar interior , we offer an alternative pulsar beacon mechanism by suggesting a pulsating magnetosphere . to understand this dynamic picture , we assume that the unipolar induction is delivering more power to the magnetosphere than the open field lines can drain .",
    "this leads to an energy built - up in the closed field lines represented by plasma pressure .",
    "although plasma pressure is neglected in eq .",
    "[ eqno1 ] , it appears indirectly through plasma drifts , which could open up the closed field lines near lc .",
    "observationally , radio pulsars are known for their stable repetitive pulse profiles .",
    "however , the pulse profile that characterizes each radio pulsar is obtained as the average over many many shots . from shot to shot , the profiles are far from identical .",
    "therefore , the period of oblique rotator is not well defined from shot to shot , which is not supposed to be in the lighthouse scenario . on the other hand , such shot to shot variations",
    "are expected in a pulsating magnetosphere .",
    "we review the basic concepts of charge separated pulsar magnetosphere and the plasma velocity @xmath7 of eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] in sec.3 .",
    "the space charge density @xmath8 is derived in the presence of a poloidal and toroidal field , and in the presence of drift velocities in sec.4 . under the concept of guiding center drifts , the idea of a critical field line",
    "is reconsidered in sec.5 .",
    "we then follow the earlier works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , to solve the magnetosphere of an isolated pulsar analytically via the force - free pulsar equation . nevertheless , we take a different approach to split the pulsar equation into two coupled equations through a separating function .",
    "each one of the coupled equations is solved by separation of variables for the global structure of the pulsar magnetosphere in sec.6 .",
    "the standard monopole - like steady state magnetosphere is presented in sec.7 .",
    "a self - consistent description of magnetosphere in terms of fields , velocities , and space charge densities is outlined in sec.8 . under continuous unipolar pumping ,",
    "the standard magnetosphere is generalized to the pulsating magnetosphere in sec.9 , and with conclusions in sec.10 .",
    "it is important to remark that eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] is written in an inertial frame where the plasma moves with velocity @xmath7 with respect to the stationary magnetic and electric fields . in the plasma moving frame ,",
    "the lorentz transformed electric field is @xmath13 and the ohm law reads @xmath14 there .",
    "this ohm law in the limit of infinite @xmath5 is known as the frozen field condition in mhd plasmas , and happens to be identical to eq .",
    "[ eqno1 ] , and we have @xmath15 and @xmath0 . as a matter of fact , for a charge separated plasma , eq .  [ eqno1 ] and eq .  [ eqno2 ] amount to the same equation always .",
    "however , eq .  [ eqno1 ] describes the magnetosphere in terms of fields , while eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] considers the magnetosphere in terms of plasma velocities .",
    "the fields and the velocities are then connected through the space charge density .    here",
    "we call to the attention that the condition of @xmath11 allows an arbitrary longitudinal velocity @xmath16 along the magnetic field line .",
    "consequently , the plasma velocity can be projected in components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field as    @xmath17    the frozen field plasma condition shows that @xmath18 is given by the @xmath12 guiding center drift of the gyro motion due to the transverse part of the electric field @xmath9 @xcite , under the constrain of @xmath19 which implies the electric field strength be @xmath20 for a magnetized plasma .",
    "this @xmath18 drift is charge independent , and for a quasi - neutral normal plasma , this drift generates no current and represents only the fluid drift velocity . but for charge separated plasmas , the @xmath12 drift corresponds a current flow .",
    "consequently , we have the picture of a stationary pulsar magnetosphere with plasma drifting with respect to the magnetic field .    in cylindrical coordinates @xmath21",
    ", the axisymmetric magnetic field can be represented as    @xmath22    where @xmath23 carries the dimension of the poloidal magnetic flux such that @xmath24 is a dimensionless flux function , and @xmath25 represents the relative ratio of the toroidal flux to the poloidal flux .",
    "the function @xmath26 is related to the axial current through    @xmath27    from the magnetic field line equation , it is easy to show that the poloidal field lines are given by the contours of @xmath24    @xmath28    the fact that the longitudinal electric field vanishes means that any potential difference along the magnetic field line will be shorted out by plasma mobility . with the longitudinal electric field @xmath11 and the magnetic field @xmath2 represented by eq .",
    "[ eqno3 ] , the transverse electric field in the magnetosphere can be expressed through the equipotential field lines of eq .",
    "[ eqno5 ] as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the equator - pole voltage drop on the pulsar surface , and @xmath24 is assigned by the corresponding surface potential label .    alternatively , we can also project the plasma velocity in poloidal and toroidal components by writing @xmath31 and @xmath32 . from eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] , we get @xmath33 by axisymmetry , and @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore have respectively    @xmath35    loading the potential distribution of the pulsar surface onto the equipotential magnetosphere poloidal field lines , we have    @xmath36    where @xmath37 measures the radial position of a point @xmath38 in the magnetosphere . substituting this result to eq .",
    "[ eqno7 ] then gives @xmath39 , and therefore    @xmath40    we call to the attention that @xmath41 drifts with an angular velocity of the pulsar .",
    "this equation is often interpreted as the beads on a wire model , where the plasma ( beads ) slides with a velocity @xmath42 along a rotating @xmath43 field line ( wire ) .",
    "we have rederived this equation with a stationary magnetosphere where the rotation comes from the guiding center drift .",
    "we have expressed the plasma velocity in two orthogonal projections .",
    "the first one is with respect to the magnetic field lines , and the second one is with respect to the cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "these two projections are independent to each other .",
    "only when the magnetic field is purely poloidal with @xmath44 that the two expressions are correspondent , and we can identify    @xmath45",
    "in the magnetosphere , the electric field @xmath9 is not the only transverse force that causes plasma drift . magnetic field line curvature and field gradient are other two major transverse forces .",
    "therefore , besides the @xmath18 drift , we also have the curvature and gradient b drifts @xcite given by    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the charge particle energies parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , these drifts are mass dependent as well as field dependent . in a thermal plasma , these energies",
    "are measued by the plasma pressure .",
    "although plasma inertia and pressure are neglected in eq .",
    "[ eqno1 ] , they appear indirectly through these two drift velocities .",
    "the direction of these two drifts depends on the sign of charge q. even in a quasi - neutral normal plasma , these are current generating drifts , while the electric drift @xmath18 represents the plasma fluid velocity only . in a charge separated plasma ,",
    "all three drifts generate currents .",
    "these plasma drifts are driven by transverse forces , and they are not emf driven velocities . to understand this , we recall that for a uniform magnetic fleld , charge particles follow a circular gyro motion along the magnetic field lines according to the equation of motion due to the plasma inertia . in the presence of a transverse force to the magnetic field such as an electric field , a centrifugal force due to curvature , and an inhomogeneous magnetic field , etc .",
    ", the circular gyro motion will be transformed into a displacing cycloid across the field lines @xcite , such that the gyro guiding center presents a transverse drift .",
    "although eq .  [ eqno2 ] gives the guiding center electric drift directly , the gyro motion itself is due to the plasma inertia",
    ". therefore , eq .  [ eqno2 ] actually includes the plasma inertia implicitly .",
    "we remark that these drift velocities can be very large and become relativistic",
    ". should the electric field @xmath9 be time varying , there would be a polarization drift as well which we will ignore here .    we should point out that in eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] only the @xmath18 drift is represented on the left side .",
    "the other two current generating drifts , that are contained in @xmath49 on the right side of eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] , do not appear in eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] because the plasma conductivity @xmath5 is infinite . for this reason ,",
    "the plasma drift velocity is given by    @xmath50    since the plasma drift velocities are obtained from the equation of motion of each charged plasma , the plasma drift velocity @xmath51 is beyond the scope of eq .",

    "[ eqno10 ] becomes    @xmath59    @xcite had derived a space charge density ( their eq.8 ) with @xmath60 alone that reads    @xmath61    in the absence of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the left side of the above equation looks like the relativistic lorentz factor , which is just coincidental .",
    "this equation predicts @xmath64 for closed ion field lines , which is consistent only to the outer portion of the dipole - like closed ion field lines . for the inner portion with @xmath65",
    ", they postulated a negative charged cloud corotating with the field lines .",
    "we antecipate the result in sec.8 that @xmath66 , such that the @xmath67 term is positive . near the pulsar , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are large , where the plasma pressure is very high , on the left side and we could have @xmath65 . farther out from the pulsar with plasma pressure decreasing",
    "we have @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath62 and @xmath63 drifts are mass dependent , they would be dominant again as the closed field lines approach lc , due to their relativistic inertia .",
    "we would have @xmath65 on approaching lc .",
    "for this reason , the closed region of a steady state magnetosphere can only extend to some intermediate radius , staying away from lc . although plasma pressure and plasma inertia are not considered in eq .",
    "[ eqno1 ] explicitly , plasma inertia appears implicitly through the guiding center drifts of the gyro motion and plasma pressure through the coefficients of the gradient b and curvature drifts .",
    "we have given a qualitative understanding of these effects in the closed region through the drift velocities , and we will return to this issue in sec.8 .",
    "in terms of cylindrical coordinates , the toroidal components of eq .",
    "[ eqno1 ] , which describes the magnetosphere in terms of fields , gives    @xmath68    whereas the poloidal components yield the pulsar equation    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the lc radius . because of the singular coefficient of the highest derivative which vanishes at @xmath71 , eq .",
    "[ eqno12 ] is a singular equation . as indicated by @xcite in sec.iii , the steady state magnetosphere , which is stationary in space ,",
    "is solved within lc , and is then analytically continued beyond lc where the pulsar equation is not valid with the tengential velocity @xmath72 . since plasma parameters like plasma pressure and velocities are not considered in the pulsar equation , analytic continuation of the field structure beyond lc amounts to solving the pulsar equation in that region with solutions on both sides matched across lc , as done numerically by @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "analytic solutions of this equation had been extensively studied , yet global solutions were not obtained explicitly @xcite .",
    "so far , solutions are developed by numerical iterrations , under the boundary condition of a dipole field at the center notably by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where the open and closed regions rotate differentially , and @xcite where the braking index is evaluated in terms of the magnetosphere dynamics .    in the open field lines , electrons and ions",
    "are assummed to stream out along their respective open field lines with equal flux .",
    "these currents will be connected to form a return loop at a distant load ( interstellar plasma ) .",
    "the electron and ion outflows are thought to be drawn by the action of the far zone quasi - neutral normal interstellar plasma floating potential @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the potential difference between the far zone interstellar plasma and the near zone electron or ion open field lines , and @xmath75 is a dimensionless scalar potential function . in particular , there will be a field line having the same potential of the interstellar plasma .",
    "this is the critical field line @xmath76 , where there is no charge and no poloidal current flow , that separates the electron and ion field lines .",
    "this means that @xmath77 , and @xmath78 should be stationary at @xmath76 .",
    "this critical field line should pierce lc with @xmath79 .",
    "nevertheless , using the interstellar emf to draw current flows in the open field lines is clearly in confrontation with the @xmath11 condition .",
    "this inconsistency can be removed should we note that the presence of a toroidal and a poloidal magnetic field in the open region can drive a poloidal and a toroidal @xmath18 drift respectively    @xmath80    the same can be applied to @xmath62 and @xmath63 drifts .",
    "all these drift velocities will , therefore , produce a component along the magnetic field lines plus a toroidal rotation , as in eq .",
    "[ eqno8 ] , and there is no need to introduce neither the interstellar potential to the near zone nor the concept of a critical field line .",

    "more field lines could be added by assigning the intermediate contour values @xmath147 . comparing to the numerical results , such as @xcite , our magnetospheric configuration reproduces well the main global features .",
    "so far , we have introduced plasma drift velocities to remove the inconsistency of the space charge density with the closed field lines , and the incinsistency of the @xmath11 condition with the emf driven plasma outflows . furthermore , we have solved analytically the pulsar equation for the global structure of the magnetosphere . above all",

    "[ eqno9b ] reads    @xmath159    we note that this equation is identical in form for a positive charge @xmath160 to eq .",
    "[ eqno28 ] . as for the @xmath62 drift of eq .",
    "[ eqno9a ] , we note that the radius of curvature @xmath161 directs from the center of curvature outward to the field lines .",
    "therefore , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are pointing outward , although they are not parallel .",
    "consequently , both @xmath63 and @xmath62 drifts are in the toroidal direction , as is @xmath18 .    as for their amplitudes ,",
    "based on eq .",
    "[ eqno28 ] , eq .",
    "[ eqno30 ] , and eq .  [ eqno9a ] , all three velocities have the same @xmath163 scaling , so their strengths can be compared by other factors . for @xmath62 , we note that @xmath164 is small when it is near the pulsar and when it is near the apex on returning back to the conjugate point of the southern equatorial region . in between ,",
    "the field lines are relatively flat , as shown in fig.9 , and @xmath164 is large . as for @xmath63 ,",
    "the ratio of this velocity to @xmath18 is    @xmath165    assumming the reference poloidal field @xmath158 comparable to @xmath166 , these two velocities become comparable when the plasma energy ( pressure ) @xmath167 .",
    "the same can also be said for @xmath168 for @xmath62 . this high plasma pressure can be found close to the pulsar surface , and it decreases as @xmath37 increases .    for a toroidal magnetic field in @xmath169 direction ,",
    "the @xmath18 drift will be poloidal but in the counter direction of closed field lines . likewise are @xmath63 and @xmath62 . by eq .",
    "[ eqno6 ] , we therefore have @xmath66 , and the factor @xmath67 in eq .",
    "[ eqno10 ] is positive .",
    "should we consider the toroidal magnetic field be in @xmath170 direction , we would get @xmath171 , and the factor @xmath67 would be positive again .",
    "we remark that the space charge density of eq .",
    "[ eqno10 ] is valid for the entire magnetosphere , not just for the closed region . in the presence of poloidal and toroidal fields , the scalar product in the square bracket on the right side of eq .",
    "[ eqno10 ] has a poloidal and a toroidal conribution .",
    "this space charge density has to be calculated together with the fields and plasma drifts in numerical solutions .",
    "we have constructed the standard magnetsphere in sec.7 where the closed region with @xmath44 is described by eq .",
    "[ eqno26 ] . on the other hand , with the self - consistent description of the magnetosphere based on fields , velocities , and space charge densities in sec.8",
    ", there should be a @xmath172 in the closed region . on this question of a toroidal field ,",
    "we note that , in a charge separated magnetosphere , a toroidal magnetic field can arise spontaneously .",
    "if we begin with a pure poloidal magnetic field in the polar region open electron field lines , equilibrium condition requires the electron plasma be at rest .",
    "this is an unstable configuration , since any longitudinal movement of the electron plasma corresponds to a poloidal current that would generate a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "this toroidal magnetic field would enhance the poloidal drift velocity ( current ) itself .",
    "since the field lines are open , an equilibrium configuration of fields and currents could be reached . with @xmath173 for electron field lines , and with small @xmath41 due to small @xmath106 , it is reasonable that the square bracket be positive and thus @xmath65 . as for the ion open field lines ,",
    "the toroidal field here begins to decline due to the ion outflows . with @xmath174 for ion field lines ,",
    "it is likely that we could have @xmath65 in some part of the field line and @xmath64 in other part .    as for the ion field lines in the closed region",
    ", there still is a toroidal field due to the imperfect shielding of the electron axial current by the ion outflow in the open region . with @xmath174 , and with the presence of a toroidal field and a high plasma pressure near the pulsar , eq .",
    "[ eqno10 ] could have @xmath65 near the pulsar . farther out with large @xmath106 ,",
    "the toroidal field becomes small , likewise is the plasma pressure , we could expect @xmath64 . with the poloidal field lines described by eq .",
    "[ eqno26 ] , the corresponding toroidal field in the closed region is represented by eq .",
    "[ eqno25b ] .",
    "because of the mirror symmetry between the upper ( north ) and lower ( south ) hemispheres , the toroidal fields have opposite sign in the two parts , which drives an outward radial current sheet on the equatorial plane . on reaching the apex of the closed region",
    ", this current sheet divides into two parts returning from the northern and southern closed poloidal field lines .",
    "we therefore have two current loops , one north and one south , to enhance the corresponding toroidal fields .",
    "this in turn enhances the radial current sheet and the current loops . in a closed finite region , this positive feedback cycle can only be stablized in the presence of dissipations .",
    "naturally , there is the usual toroidal current sheet on the equatorial plane beyond lc for the split monopole poloidal field lines .    to find an alternative beacon mechanism",
    ", we first racall that the current model pictures a corotating magnetic field that drags the magnetospheric plasma . in response to this",
    ", a rotation induced electric field is generated in the stationary frame of space . in this picture",
    ", the rotating magnetic field is the prime driver , and the magnetosphere is decoupled from the unipolar induction of the pulsar .",
    "here , we view the unipolar induction inside the pulsar and the magnetosphere outside the pulsar as one coupled system . the unipolar induction delivers charges separated by their signs to the polar and equatorial regions at a given rate .",
    "the current flow inside the neutron star interacts with the magnetic field , generating a braking torque .",
    "the charges are then channelled to the magnetosphere along the field lines , and are ejected to the interstellar space as stellar winds through open field lines , which allows the unipolar induction to operate continuously .",
    "considering the unipolar energy pumping rate exceeds the poynting outflow rate along the open field lines , plasma density and pressure will build up in the magnetosphere , particularly in the closed region . in the outer part of the closed region extending to intermediate @xmath106 with @xmath64 , @xmath63 and @xmath62 are small .",
    "however , as the plasma pressure build - up reaches there , these velocities begin to increase .",
    "eventually , they get to the point of having @xmath65 , flipping open the field lines and releasing the trapped plasma and magnetic energies . furthermore , the field lines can also be flipped open in the outer part of the closed region by the positive feedback on the toroidal field which appears in the @xmath67 factor of eq .",
    "[ eqno10 ] .",
    "once depleted of plasmas , in the sense that plasma density is so low that eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] is not warranted , the magnetosphere will then be recharged all over to the standard configuration , and the whole cycle starts anew . instead of a stationary magnetosphere",
    ", we therefore have a scenario of a pulsating magnetosphere where the openning of the closed field lines either by unipolar pumping on drift velocities or by positive feedback on the toroidal field works as a magnetic switch , which offers an altenative mechanism for pulsar beacons . in this alternative picture ,",
    "an observer aligned with the magnetic axis sees the beacons separated by the unipolar induction charging period , instead of the pulsar rotation period .    here",
    ", we have reached the pulsating picture of the magnetosphere through a steady state approach by viewing the unipolar induction inside the pulsar and the magnetosphere outside as a coupled system . as a matter of fact",
    ", the steady state approach may not be adequate to describe a charge separated magnetosphere .",
    "we call to the attention that a charge separated plasma is a very unstable plasma due to the fact that any plasma flow ( drift ) is a current flow which generates magnetic field that drives drifts . for this reason",
    ", we might have to let go the lighthouse paradigm , and consider the time dependent model with maxwell equations coupled to the plasma equations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the inherent unstable nature of a charge separated magnetosphere could be the cause of periodic beaming of electromagnetic waves .",
    "we have taken the view of interpreting the magnetic field @xmath2 of the magnetosphere as stationary in space , and the electric field @xmath9 as established by uploading the potential distribution of the pulsar surface to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the plasma velocity @xmath7 is , therefore , the drift response in eq .",
    "[ eqno2 ] which rotates with an angular velocity of the pulsar .",
    "the presence of a magnetosphere allows the pulsar surface charges be channelled to the field lines , and keeps the counter electric field in the pulsar interior low .",
    "this warrants the continuous operation of the unipolar induction that constantly pumps energy to the magnetosphere . in this scenario , the energetics of the magnetosphere",
    "is coupled to the unipolar induction of the neutron star .    by introducing the gradient b and curvature plasma drifts and the presence of a toroidal field",
    ", we have removed the inconsistency between the space charge density and the curvature of the dipole - like closed ion field lines . also , the inconsistency between introducing the far zone interstellar plasma floating potential to the near zone open field lines to generate an emf driven plasma flow along open field lines and the @xmath11 plasma condition can be removed as well by drift velocities .",
    "although plasma inertia and pressure are neglected in the force - free pulsar equation , they enter the magnetospheric dynamics implicitly through the @xmath12 , gradient b , and curvature plasma drifts , which are the respective guiding center drifts of the basic gyro motion . since the gradient b and curvature drifts are mass dependent , the closed region should be bounded at a distance within lc .",
