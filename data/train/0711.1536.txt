    "since the simple modules of a ring and its semi - simple quotient are the same , for many purposes it suffices to consider the latter ring . in this note",

    "we adopt an inductive approach via extensions ; that is , we assume @xmath2 is given as an extension @xmath22 with @xmath4 , @xmath6 under control .",

    "the classifying space of @xmath24 completed at @xmath1 , @xmath25 , decomposes stably into a wedge of indecomposable summands @xmath26 each summand @xmath27 is the mapping telescope of a primitive idempotent @xmath28 in the ring of stable self - maps of @xmath25 , @xmath29 .",
    "thus there is a one - to - one correspondence between the indecomposable summands and the simple modules of the ring of stable self - maps .",
