    "@xmath0 production  @xcite is a copious source of @xmath7-pairs and , hence , of isolated leptons at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "top quark production will be intensely studied as a signal at these colliders .",
    "in addition , it constitutes an important background for many new particle searches .",
    "examples include the leptonic signals for cascade decays of supersymmetric particles  @xcite or searches for @xmath8  @xcite and @xmath4  @xcite decays .",
    "usually , @xmath0 production is considered in the narrow - width approximation ( nwa ) , which effectively decouples top production and decay ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nwa](a ) ) . whenever resonant top production dominates , this approximation is well motivated and it greatly simplifies matrix element evaluation and phase space generation .",
    "the nwa is also useful for single - resonant top production as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nwa](b )  @xcite . in some cases calculations have been further simplified by also treating the decaying @xmath7 bosons as on - shell particles .     in the narrow - width approximation :",
    "( a ) on - shell @xmath0 production and ( b ) @xmath9 single top production .",
    "the double bars indicate heavy quark propagators which may be treated as on - shell particles in various approximations.,title=\"fig:\",width=623 ] +    [ fig : nwa ]    naturally , the accuracy of these approximations needs to be tested , which requires a full calculation of off - shell effects .",
    "restrictive selection cuts , as used for efficient suppression of @xmath0 backgrounds  @xcite , tend to be optimized against on - shell top production which may substantially enhance the relative importance of off - shell contributions . in applying the nwa ,",
    "another problem inadvertently arises : the feynman diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig : nwa](a ) and [ fig : nwa](b ) have identical initial and final states . when approximate cross sections , each specialized to a particular phase space region , are added up to obtain the total rate , double - counting can occur , and interference effects in overlap regions may not be properly accounted for .",
    "one thus needs a calculation which includes both resonant and non - resonant contributions , using finite width top - quark propagators , which correctly includes interference effects between the various contributions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present such a calculation for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production .",
    "in addition to merging resonant and non - resonant effects for the top quarks , we also include finite width effects for the @xmath7 bosons , i.e. we consider general @xmath10 final states .",
    "finite top width effects , at the level of @xmath11 decays , have been considered previously for @xmath12 production  @xcite .",
    "the complete set of feynman graphs for @xmath13 processes has been generated as well  @xcite .",
    "however , the full treatment of lepton final states with spin correlations and off - shell contributions is new even for the @xmath0 case . to our knowledge",
    ", no previous calculation of finite width effects in @xmath1 production exists .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we discuss various methods of including finite width effects and discuss their advantages and their practicality .",
    "we adopt the `` overall factor scheme '' and apply it in section  [ sec : general ] to @xmath14 production and the analogous process with one additional colored parton in the final state .",
    "while the matrix elements can , in principle , be generated with automated programs like madgraph @xcite , the proper inclusion of finite widths , preservation of electroweak and strong gauge invariance , avoidance of double counting and of divergences in extraneous phase space regions requires manual intervention . in section  [ sec : general ] we describe the content of our calculation , the various consistency tests , and other important features of the program which we have developed .",
    "our program has already been used to study backgrounds to @xmath3 decays at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "we expand on this analysis in section  [ sec : application ] and use @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays , more precisely the backgrounds produced by @xmath0 and @xmath1 production , to exemplify the size of off - shell and on - shell contributions and compare our full simulations with previous background estimates .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the inclusion of finite width effects is needed in order to avoid the singular behavior of the tree level propagators on mass - shell , @xmath15 .",
    "an approach that is straightforward to implement and , hence , well suited for automatic code generators like madgraph / helas @xcite is to use a breit - wigner - type propagator with fixed width for all top and @xmath7 propagators , making no distinction between time - like and space - like momenta . for massive fermions like the top quark one simply substitutes [ eq : tprop_naive ] ( p ) = =   .",
    "however , this technique , also referred to as _ fixed - width scheme _ , will lead to gauge - dependent matrix elements .",
    "gauge invariance requires that the ward identity k_v^= -i g [ i^-1(p_1 ) - i^-1(p_2 ) ] [ eq : ward - id ] ( with @xmath16 ) be satisfied , where @xmath17 is the gauge boson ",

    "close to resonance , on the other hand , the amplitude effectively reduces to the dominant resonant terms .",
    "as we will show in section  iii , this approach provides an excellent interpolation between on and off resonance regions , with ambiguities never rising beyond the 12% level .",
    "a second practical solution starts from the observation that the ward identity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ward - id ] ) remains fulfilled if one changes constant terms in the inverse propagator .",
    "this suggests another method to restore gauge invariance , which has been dubbed the _ complex - mass scheme _ @xcite .",

    "an unphysical consequence of the universal substitution ( [ eq : complexmass ] ) is that space - like propagators receive imaginary contributions , or that the top - higgs yukawa coupling , @xmath46 , receives an imaginary part .",

    "top - quarks are a very important source of lepton backgrounds to new physics searches at the lhc : the large production cross section typical for a strong interaction process combines with a sizable branching fraction into leptons which , due to the large mass of the @xmath7 , often survive isolation cuts .",
    "suppression techniques for top quark backgrounds , like a veto on central jets , which is very effective against the @xmath29-quarks of the @xmath2 decay chain , enhance the relative importance of off - resonant effects and may exacerbate errors introduced by approximate modeling of matrix elements .",
