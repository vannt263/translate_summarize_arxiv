    "we consider the case in which all of the quantum numbers get large together .",
    "what this means is multiplying all of the quantum numbers by a number and studying the asymptotic behavior of the clebsch - gordan coefficient as this multiplier gets large .",

    "wigner@xcite discussed the physical interpretation and classical limits of clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "he described a certain average behavior , and did not analyze the oscillatory nature of the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "there are references in this work to edmonds@xcite and brussaard and tolhoek@xcite . in 1968 ,",
    "ponzano and regge@xcite presented asymptotic expressions that included the oscillations .",
    "their work included an interpretation of certain angles that occur in their results and in ours . additionally , they discussed the allowed and forbidden regions .",
    "however their derivation is , in their words , `` rather heuristic . ''",
    "it was borne out in their comparisons with the exact values .",
    "william miller@xcite derived similar expressions using semiclassical methods in 1974 , but did not treat the forbidden region .",
    "another work that relates to the present paper is that of srinivasa rao and v. rajeswari@xcite .",

    "the allowed region is the same as the region in which the three @xmath122-values defined in eq .",
