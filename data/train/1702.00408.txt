    "a major strategy for the indirect detection of dark matter is the search for photons arising from dark matter annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs )  @xcite .",
    "the dark matter masses in dsphs are well constrained from stellar kinematics  @xcite , and the systematic uncertainties associated with the expected backgrounds  @xcite are relatively small compared with other astrophysical targets and channels used in indirect detection .",
    "null detection results from fermi - lat place strong limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section for particles with mass @xmath1 gev  @xcite , ruling out thermal relic dark matter for velocity - independent cross sections to some final states . targeted ground - based observatories",
    "provide the most stringent limits for masses @xmath2 tev  @xcite .    in determining the flux of photons arising from dark matter annihilation , the main astrophysical dependence is encapsulated in the @xmath0-factor of the target .",
    "if the annihilation cross section @xmath3 is velocity - independent , the @xmath0-factor is simply an integral over the line - of - sight and over a given angular region of the square of the dark matter density profile of the target . with this assumption",
    "the @xmath0-factor is independent of the underlying particle physics such as the dark matter mass and cross section , and furthermore , it is independent of the particular phase space distribution of the dark matter .",
    "many authors have determined the @xmath0-factors from the stellar kinematics of dsphs under the assumption of a velocity - independent annihilation cross section  @xcite .    however , from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the annihilation cross section may be velocity dependent ; for example , theoretically well - studied models have @xmath4-wave suppressed dark matter annihilation ( @xmath5 ) . additionally , it has been long appreciated that there are some dark matter models in which dark matter annihilation exhibits a _ sommerfeld enhancement _ at low relative velocities  @xcite . if the annihilation cross section is velocity - dependent , the photon flux arising from dark matter annihilation does in fact depend on the dark matter velocity distribution , and the astrophysical dependence can not be entirely factorized from the particle physics .",
    "however , there has not yet been a systematic study of @xmath0-factors for velocity - dependent cross sections .    in this paper",
    "we determine the analog of the @xmath0-factor which is relevant for sommerfeld - enhanced dark matter annihilation .",
    "we use a simple isotropic and spherically - symmetric model for the dark matter phase space distribution of the dsphs , which  under the assumption of a model for the gravitational potential  is constrained by the measured stellar velocity distributions .",
    "we show that this new astrophysics factor , denoted as @xmath6 , depends on one parameter which is determined by the detailed particle physics of dark matter annihilation .",
    "the results that we present have important practical applications for interpreting limits on ( or establishing possible detections of ) a dark matter annihilation signal from dsphs .",
    "for example , if we consider a single dsph target , the @xmath0-factor is the quantity which allows one to translate a statistical bound on ( or an observed excess due to ) the number of photons arising from dark matter annihilation into a corresponding limit on ( or value for ) the dark matter annihilation cross section .",
    "similarly , a determination of the sommerfeld - enhanced @xmath0-factor would allow one to translate observations of the photon flux into preferred and/or excluded values of the sommerfeld - enhanced cross section .",
    "in addition , we may consider the results from a combination of multiple dsph targets . if one observes multiple targets , the relative ordering of the @xmath0-factors also provides an important consistency check for the dark matter interpretation of any potentially observed excess .",
    "for a given dark matter annihilation cross section , the expected flux of photons arising from dark matter annihilation scales with the @xmath0-factor  @xcite .",
    "thus , if an excess is observed in one dwarf spheroidal target , one would also expect excesses in other targets with larger @xmath0-factors ; a failure to see such excesses would draw into question the consistency of the dark matter interpretation of the photon signal .",
    "however , since the different dwarf spheroidal galaxies can have very different velocity dispersions , the relative ordering of the sommerfeld - enhanced @xmath0-factors may be quite different from that of the ordinary @xmath0-factor .",
    "thus , a pattern of excesses in the gamma - ray emissions of many dwarf spheroidal galaxies , which may appear inconsistent with velocity - independent dark matter annihilation , may still be consistent with sommerfeld - enhanced dark matter annihilation .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "distribution ] , we review the formalism for obtaining the dark matter velocity distribution from stellar observations . in section  [ sec :",
    "sommerfeld ] , we review the theoretical considerations underlying the sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter annihilation and derive an expression for the sommerfeld - enhanced @xmath0-factor , @xmath6 . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our results for @xmath6 for several dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",

    "in a dsph , the positions in the plane of the sky and the line - of - sight velocities of stars are resolved , leading to a measurement of the projected stellar velocity distribution . for the analysis in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the 3d dark matter velocity distribution , which is not necessarily the same as the stellar velocity distribution . to determine this distribution , we use constraints on the gravitational potentials of dsphs , in combination with well - motivated theoretical assumptions .    to calculate the dark matter velocity distribution , we assume the orbits of the dark matter particles are isotropic and the potential is spherically - symmetric .",
    "this approximation is justified when examining satellite galaxies in cosmological simulations in which the star particles have ratios of tangential - to - radial velocity anisotropy in the range @xmath7  @xcite . under these assumptions",
    ", we can use the eddington formula for the isotropic distribution function @xmath8 which is a function of energy alone .",

    "although certain forms of the velocity dependence , such as @xmath5 , reduce the cross section below the sensitivity of current experiments , these models may become accessible as the sensitivity improves",
    ". this will be particularly true as new dsphs continue to be discovered by the dark energy survey  @xcite , and even further into the future by the large synoptic survey telescope .",
    "accounting for velocity - dependent cross sections will also be a future requirement of numerical methods that scan the theoretical parameter space given large spectroscopic data sets  @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", our analysis may be improved by extending beyond nfw profiles and isotropic stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "the dark matter potentials of dsphs are at present consistent with both cores  @xcite and cusped profiles  @xcite , and the shape of the dark matter phase space distribution is different in both cases , even for isotropic models . for anisotropic models ,",
    "the dark matter distribution function depends on additional integrals of motion beyond just the energy .",
    "guidance may come from cosmological simulations , which are able to determine the phase space distribution of the dark matter and stars separately  @xcite .",
