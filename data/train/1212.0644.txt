    "the validity of the collinear factorization  the basis of applications of qcd to hard processes  was challenged in the year 2009 by the experimental data measured by the babar collaboration @xcite for the kinematics @xmath3 .",
    "this year , new experimental data by the belle collaboration @xcite were presented that do not indicate such a growth and are grossly compatible with the qcd expectations . in this presentation , we show how these data and the previous ones by the cello @xcite and cleo @xcite collaborations can be analyzed within the theoretical scheme of light - cone sum rules ( lcsr)s that incorporates contributions from qcd perturbation theory and higher - twist corrections . within qcd , the pion - photon transition form factor ( tff ) @xmath4",
    "is given by the matrix element @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the quark electromagnetic current and @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "for the asymmetric kinematics @xmath9 , one has to include into the calculation the interaction of the ( quasi ) real photon at long distances @xmath10 . to accomplish this goal",
    ", we apply the approach of lcsrs @xcite that effectively accounts for the effects of the long - distance interactions of the real photon by making use of a dispersion relation in @xmath11 and applying quark - hadron duality in the vector channel @xcite . taking the limit @xmath12",

    "for instance , for the twist - four contribution we use the effective description @xcite @xmath18 with @xmath19 gev@xmath15 @xcite . here",
    "we used the abbreviations @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the effective threshold in the vector channel .",
    "the leading twist - two contribution has the perturbative expansion ( @xmath24 ) @xmath25 the corresponding contributions from ( [ eq : t_exp ] ) to the spectral density ( [ eq : r_twists ] ) have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "for the term @xmath26 we employ the corrected version computed in @xcite .",
    "the `` bunch '' of the admissible twist - two pion das @xmath27 was determined in @xcite within the framework of qcd srs with nonlocal condensates ( nlc)s . this da `` bunch '' ( shown graphically in fig .  [ fig:2d ] in the form of a rectangle ) can be effectively parameterized in terms of the first two gegenbauer coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 to reduce the expansion to @xmath30 .",
    "$ ] our next goal is to extract a pion da that provides best agreement with all sets of the existing data by performing a fit procedure of the gegenbauer coefficients @xmath31 within the basis of lcsrs , cf .",
    "( [ eq : lcsr - ff ] ) .",
    "the results for the combined set of data from cello&cleo&belle  termed ccbe  will be contrasted to those from the cello&cleo&babar set  called ccbb .",
    "in fig .  [ fig:2d ] , we present the confidence region of the @xmath32 values in the form of error ellipses in the @xmath33 plane , obtained by fitting different sets of data . we take into account only statistical errors and exclude theoretical uncertainties  in contrast to our previous work in @xcite . using lcsrs with the pion das obtained in qcd sr nlc @xcite ,",
    "one arrives at the predictions shown in terms of the ( green ) rectangle in comparison with the error ellipses pertaining to the different sets of data defined in the previous section .     and taken at @xmath34  gev scale .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath35 are shown at the centers of the ellipses , while differences between data sets are displayed along the links in units of 1@xmath36 .",
    "the vertical lines show the range of values computed on the lattice : dashed line@xcite ; dashed - dotted line@xcite .",
    "[ fig:2d ] , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the best - fit values of the @xmath35 goodness criterion @xmath37 ( ndf = number of degrees of freedom ) are shown as centers of the ellipses , with the deviations from one data set to another with reference to the rectangle being displayed along the links and expressed in units of one standard deviation ( 1@xmath38 ) .",
    "we conclude that the inclusion of the babar data to those obtained before by cello&cleo leads to an approximately 3@xmath36 shift @xcite of the confidence region away from the ( black ) ellipse at the bottom .",
    "the result is represented by the ( red ) dotted ellipse at the top accompanied by a significant increase of @xmath39 from 0.4 to 2 ( for the ccbb data set ) . if we include to the cello&cleo data only the belle data set ccbe , then the shift of the confidence region is only moderate giving rise to a slight increase of @xmath39 from 0.4 to 0.6 ( ellipse in the middle ) .",
    "goodness criterion for the considered experiments as being the sum of the individual @xmath35 values associated with each experiment .",
    "] we quantify the deviations of these data sets from our theoretical estimates , encoded in the rectangle , in terms of @xmath36 values shown along the links which connect the central data values with the bms model ( ) inside the rectangle . here , and in the next figure , the vertical broken lines denote the constraints from two different lattice simulations : dashed lines  @xcite ; dashed  dotted lines  @xcite .     and @xmath40 at the lattice scale @xmath41  gev@xmath15 . the lower stretched ellipse  solid ( blue ) line  corresponds to a 2d fit to the ccbe data , while the upper one ( red line ) represents the ccbb one .",
    "in contrast to fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] , we also include here the uncertainty related to the twist - four coefficient @xmath42 .",
    "the vertical lines show the range of values computed in two lattice calculations using the same designations as in fig.[fig:2d ] .",
    "[ fig : moments],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    an immediate conclusion from these considerations is that ( i ) the bms da is inside the 1@xmath36 ccbe and inside the 0.6@xmath36 region of the cello&cleo set , whereas the bms `` bunch '' greatly overlaps with both of these error ellipses . at the same time , the central point of ccbb is 6.2@xmath36 away and has no overlap with the ccbe ellipse .",
    "( ii ) the asymptotic da ( ) and the chernyak - zhitnitsky ( cz ) da ( ) are both more than @xmath43 away from ccbe .",
    "( iii ) the existing lattice calculations of @xmath28 , shown as vertical lines in figs .  [ fig:2d],[fig : moments ] , are not restrictive enough to narrow down the interval of @xmath28 , though the narrower band @xcite supports both the ccbe data and our theoretical results but not the ccbb data . on the other hand ,",
    "the previous lattice simulation @xcite is compatible with all sets of data and with our theoretical predictions as well .",
    "with all these data in our hands , we may attempt to extract values of the moment @xmath44 by combining the real data from ccbe and ccbb with the results of lattice simulations . the combined constraints from ccbe ( lower ( blue ) error ellipse in fig .  [",
    "fig : moments ] ) and the lattice constraints from @xcite ( dashed - dotted vertical lines ) lead to the following predictions for @xmath40 : @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "in contrast , the constraints extracted from the ccbb data ( upper ( red ) ellipse ) do not allow a reliable determination of the @xmath44 range in the background of the lattice results from @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the constraints from @xcite are not stringent enough to differentiate these sets of data .",
    "we step up from a 2d to a 3d analysis of the data , by including the next coefficient @xmath47 .",

    "+ to conclude : ( i ) the description of the ccbe data provides a better @xmath57 relative to @xmath58 following from ccbb .",
    "( ii ) the ccbe and ccbb ellipsoids are significantly separated from each other , so that a qcd description of these sets of data requires substantially different das .",

    "[ sec:3d ] , can be linked to other characteristics of the pion da .",

    "analogous results obtained with the set ccbb . [ fig : pida ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]    the main difference between the two graphics in fig.[fig : pida ] stems from their distinct behavior near the endpoints that are concentrated inside the interval @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , one observes that the da ( including uncertainties )  shaded area in the right panel  providing best - fit to the ccbb data deviates significantly from the bms `` bunch '' .",
    "a mathematical tool to quantify the endpoint characteristics of the pion da is @xmath62 , i.e. , the average derivative of @xmath63 in the interval @xmath64 , that was invented in @xcite and possesses the following properties : @xmath65 , while @xmath66 .",
    "the quantity @xmath67 can be used @xcite to probe the endpoint behavior of these different sorts of das : @xmath68 we see that the slope in the endpoint region of the best - fit da to ccbb is much stronger than for ccbe .",
    "while the ccbe - based da profile agrees with the bms `` bunch '' , it is incompatible with the ccbb shape .",
    "we presented here an analysis of all experimental data on the pion - photon transition form factor and compared in detail the results obtained with two different sets of data : cello , cleo , babar  ( ccbb ) vs. cello , cleo , and belle  ( ccbe ) .",
    "our analysis is based on lcsrs at nlo , also taking into account the twist - four term .",
    "the nnlo@xmath69 radiative correction was included into the theoretical uncertainties together with the twist - six contribution @xcite .",
    "the key results can be summarized as follows : ( i ) we performed a 2d ( parameters @xmath32 ) and a 3d ( parameters @xmath70 ) analysis , fitting both the ccbe and the ccbb data sets .",
    "we found that in both cases the fit to ccbe provides a significantly better @xmath39 value .",
    "( ii ) the ccbe 2d fit agrees well within error bars with the previous findings from the cello and cleo fits and the predictions derived from qcd sr nlc@xcite with the bms `` bunch '' and the bms model da .",
    "the fits are also compatible with the constraints on @xmath28 extracted from lattice computations .",
    "in contrast , the ccbb 2d fit has no overlap with the ccbe result and it also does not comply with the qcd sr nlc predictions .",
    "( iii ) the results of the 3d fit to the ccbe and ccbb data sets do not intersect at the level of a 1@xmath36 accuracy . at the same time the ccbe result is much closer to the bms `` bunch '' , but still outside the 1@xmath36 area .",
    "( iv ) the qualitative features of the 3d fit to the ccbe and ccbb data can be differentiated in terms of the behavior of the corresponding profiles of the pion das near the endpoints : the ccbe has a less pronounced slope and is close to the bms `` bunch '' , whereas the slope of ccbb is larger and gives no support to the bms das .",
