    "recent cosmological observations support that the universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion , and that the transition to the accelerated phase has been realized in the recent cosmological past @xcite . in order to explain this remarkable behavior , and despite the intuition that this can be achieved only through a fundamental theory of nature , physicists can still propose some paradigms for its description , such are theories of modified gravity @xcite , or `` field '' models of dark energy .",
    "the field models that have been discussed widely in the literature consider a canonical scalar field ( quintessence ) @xcite , a phantom field , that is a scalar field with a negative sign of the kinetic term @xcite , or the combination of quintessence and phantom in a unified model named quintom @xcite .    in field",
    "dark energy models one can find potential - independent solutions @xcite , but in general the cosmological evolution depends significantly on the potential choice . in the quintessence case , one well studied potential is the inverse - power law one @xcite .",
    "this potential exhibits `` tracker '' behavior , that is for a large class of initial conditions the cosmological evolution converges to a common solution at late times @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in such models the quintessence energy density remains small at early and intermediate times and thus the known cosmological epochs are not affected .",
    "finally , a theoretical justification of power - law potentials can arise through supersymmetric considerations @xcite .    the cosmological evolution in such quintessence models at early times ,",
    "is dominated by the matter - fluid and one can obtain the tracker solutions analytically @xcite . at intermediate times",
    "the quintessence field is still small , but non - negligible , and one has to rely on perturbative analytical expressions @xcite .",
    "however , such an extension to low redshift is very useful , since observations like supernovae ia , wmap and sdss ones , are related to this period @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are interested in investigating the phantom scenario in power - law potentials , both at high and low redshifts , and provide the tracker solutions and the perturbative analytical expressions respectively . due to the `` inverse '' kinetic behavior of phantoms in potential slopes , we expect that we have to consider normal power - law potentials instead of inverse power - law ones . indeed , starting with an arbitrary power law , we find that physically meaningful cosmological evolution excludes negative exponents",
    ".    the plan of the work is as follows : in section [ zeroord ] we construct phantom models in power - law potentials and we present the matter - dominated solutions . in section [ firstord ]",
    "we derive the cosmological solutions at intermediate times , that is when the phantom dark energy is non - negligible , but still sub - dominant comparing to the matter content of the universe . in section [ analnum ]",
    "we compare our analytical expressions with the exact numerical evolution of the phantom scenario .",
    "finally , in section [ discuss ] we provide some applications of the model discussing its cosmological consequences , and we summarize our results .",
    "let us construct the simple phantom cosmological scenario in a flat universe .",
    "the action of a universe constituted of a phantom field @xmath3 is @xcite : @xmath4 , \\label{actionquint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the phantom field potential and the term @xmath7 accounts for the ( dark ) matter content of the universe , considered as dust . finally ,",
    "although we could straightforwardly include baryonic matter and radiation in the model , for simplicity reasons we neglect them since we are interested in @xmath8 era .",
    "the friedmann equations are @xcite : @xmath9 @xmath10 while the evolution equation for the phantom field is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hubble parameter and @xmath13 the scale factor . in these expressions",
    ", @xmath14 is the dark matter density , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the density and pressure of the phantom field given by : @xmath17 therefore , we can equivalently write the evolution equation in field terms as : @xmath18 the system of equations closes by considering the evolution of the matter density , which in the case of dust reads simply @xmath19 , with @xmath20 its value at present .",
    "finally , the dark energy equation - of - state parameter is given by @xmath21    as mentioned in the introduction , in the present work we study phantom evolution in power - law potentials .",
    "that is we consider : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant with units of @xmath24 .",
    "note that we prefer to insert the minus sign in the exponent in order to coincide with the usual notation of the literature .",
    "a priori we do not restrict the value of @xmath25 .",
    "however , as we are going to see , energy positivity will force @xmath25 to be negative and bounded , that is potential ( [ pot ] ) will be a normal ( and not inverse ) power law .",
    "it proves convenient to express the aforementioned cosmological system using the scale factor @xmath26 as the independent variable , since it is straightforwardly related to the redshift @xmath27 which is used in observations .",
    "following @xcite we define @xmath28 and thus the first friedmann equation gives @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for @xmath6 .",
    "thus , one can simply write : @xmath31 comparing to the quintessence case , and apart from the obvious expectation that @xmath32 is now negative , we observe , that it is also bounded .",
    "in particular , requiring phantom total energy positivity ( @xmath33 ) we obtain @xmath34 . finally , using expressions ( [ rhox])-([hx ] )",
    ", the field evolution equation ( [ phiddot ] ) becomes @xmath35 with prime denoting the derivative with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "this equation is exact and accounts for the complete dynamics of the phantom scenario .    in this section",
    "we desire to present the tracker solutions during the matter - dominated era .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath36 , or equivalently @xmath37 . in this case equation ( [ eomx ] ) is simplified as : @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the zero subscript in parentheses denotes just this zeroth - order solution in terms of @xmath32 , or equivalently in terms of the phantom energy density , and must not be confused later on with the subscript @xmath40 without parentheses which stands for the present value of a quantity .",
    "equation ( [ eomxzero ] ) can be easily solved analytically in the case of power - law potentials .",
    "for @xmath41 we acquire : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constants determined by initial conditions . for @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( which is the trivial case of a constant potential ) ,",
    "the general solution of ( [ eomxzero ] ) is @xmath47 where the function @xmath48 is related to the potential parameters through @xmath49^{\\frac{1}{2+\\alpha}}.   \\label{calpha}\\ ] ] in ( [ solphizero ] ) we have kept only the solution part that remains small ( together with its derivative ) for small @xmath26 s , in order to be consistent with the matter - dominated approximation ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "that is why initial - condition dependent constants are absent ( which is just the central idea of tracker solutions ) .",
    "in addition , it is easy to see that this solution remains regular for @xmath50 .",
    "the zeroth - order solution for @xmath51 can be calculated from ( [ rhox ] ) under @xmath52 , that is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "the result is : @xmath55 from this expression we educe the physically interesting result that @xmath56 in order for @xmath57 to be positive ( additionally in this case the @xmath48-definition in ( [ calpha ] ) is unambiguous ) .",
    "the restriction of @xmath25 to negative values , that is the consideration of normal power - law potentials instead of inverse power - law ones ( contrary to quintessence case ) , was expected due to the `` inverse '' kinetic behavior of phantoms in potential slopes .",
    "the additional lower bound of @xmath25 values , which breaks this form of symmetry between phantom and quintessence models , arises from the extra and necessary assumption of positivity of the total phantom energy , which is not present in quintessence case @xcite where one can always obtain it ( the potentials can always be shifted to positive values in cosmology ) .",
    "in other words , if the potential is too steep ( large @xmath58 ) , then at early times ( where the field value @xmath59 , i.e it is close to the potential minimum ) the phantom potential energy will be very small ( @xmath60 ) and thus unable to make the total energy positive . on the other hand ,",
    "if the potential is smooth ( small @xmath58 ) then positivity is obtained .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath41 separates the two regions , and indeed one can see that the energy density arising form ( [ solalpha2 ] ) is negative unless @xmath61 , in which case it is exactly zero . but @xmath61 is implied by the requirement @xmath62 at small @xmath26 . therefore , for the limiting case @xmath41 , the matter - dominating condition leads to @xmath63 , and thus this exponent value bounds the two aforementioned regions .",
    "the corresponding zeroth - order solution for @xmath16 is @xmath64 , which leads to : @xmath65 therefore , for the zeroth - order solution of the equation - of - state parameter we obtain : @xmath66 that is @xmath67 is constant .",
    "note that @xmath56 leads to @xmath68 , which is a self - consistency test of our calculations since it is the basic feature of phantom cosmology .",
    "finally , we can calculate the zeroth - order behavior of the phantom density parameter as @xmath69 , with @xmath19 , acquiring @xmath70^{-1}\\label{om0tilde}.\\ ] ]    expressions ( [ solphizero ] ) , ( [ rhophizero ] ) , ( [ wzerosol ] ) and ( [ om0tilde ] ) are the tracker solutions for phantom cosmology in power - law potentials .",
    "equivalently they can be expressed as a function of time , considering @xmath71 since we are in the matter - dominated era , as : @xmath72 with the equation - of - state parameter given by ( [ wzerosol ] ) .",
    "these expressions provide an excellent approximation to the behavior of the phantom field as long as @xmath73 .",
    "as cosmological evolution continues , the phantom field increases and phantom energy density becomes non - negligible , although still dominated by the dark matter one .",
    "thus , we expect that the various quantities will progressively start diverging from the expressions obtained above . in this section",
    "we are interested in studying analytically this intermediate evolution stage , and thus we perform a first - order perturbation to the zeroth order solutions of section [ zeroord ] . the corresponding quantities are denoting by the subscript @xmath74 in parentheses , and the total ones by tilde , i.e : @xmath75 this perturbation is equivalent with keeping terms up to first order in @xmath32 ( i.e keeping only @xmath76 ) and in @xmath77 , in the exact evolution equation ( [ eomx ] ) .",
    "in addition , one can also expand the potential as @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , inserting the expansions ( [ firstorder ] ) in ( [ eomx ] ) , we obtain @xmath79 + { 3a\\phi_{(0)}'v\\over 2 \\rho_{m}}+ \\nonumber \\\\ + { 3\\rho_{\\phi ( 0)}\\over   { ( \\rho_{m})}^{2 } } { dv\\over d\\phi}- { 3 \\over \\rho_{m}}{d^2 v \\over d\\phi^2}\\phi_{(1 ) } = 0 , \\label{eomxfristord }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 . thus ,",
    "for the power - law potential ( [ pot ] ) we acquire @xmath80 + { 27 \\kappa a^{3 } \\phi_{(0)}^{1-\\alpha}\\over 2(2+\\alpha)\\rho_{m0}}- \\nonumber \\\\ & - & { 3\\alpha(1+\\alpha)\\kappa a^{3 } \\phi_{(0)}^{-2-\\alpha}\\phi_{(1)}\\over \\rho_{m0 } } = 0 .",
    "\\label{eomxfristord2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the general solution of ( [ eomxfristord2 ] ) , for @xmath56 , is @xmath81 where we have kept only the part that remains small ( together with its derivative ) for small @xmath26 s , in order to be consistent with the matter - dominated approximation .",
    "the perturbation of @xmath51 can be calculated from ( [ rhox ] ) keeping the corresponding terms , thus : @xmath82 where @xmath83 as it arises from @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , using also ( [ solphizero ] ) , ( [ rhophizero ] ) and ( [ phifirstorder ] ) in order to express the result in terms of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we acquire @xmath87 similarly , the perturbation of @xmath88 can arise form ( [ wx ] ) as @xmath89 since @xmath90 . therefore , the final result writes @xmath91 expressions ( [ rhophifirstordersolna ] ) and ( [ wfirstorder ] ) coincide with the corresponding one for quintessence in inverse power - law potentials @xcite , however @xmath92 and @xmath93 has a sign difference and in addition @xmath25 is negative and bounded . thus , @xmath86 is negative and , contrary to quintessence , @xmath94 is negative while @xmath95 is positive .    in conclusion ,",
    "the total solutions for intermediate times , that is at low redshifts , read : @xmath96,\\ \\ \\label{phitilde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath97,\\ \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath98,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is given by ( [ calpha ] ) .",
    "finally , @xmath99 can be easily calculated as @xmath100 , giving lastly , note that since we have these quantities as a function of the scale factor , it is straightforward to express them as a function of the redshift @xmath27 through @xmath101 , with @xmath102 the present value .",
    "in the previous two sections we extracted analytical expressions for phantom evolution in power - law potentials , when the universe is dominated by the dark matter sector , and we argued that these solutions are valid at early and intermediate times , that is at both high and low redshift . in order to test the precision of our formulae , we evolve numerically the exact cosmological system calculating the exact quantities @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and then we examine their divergence from the zeroth and first order expressions by investigating the corresponding ratios .",
    "we choose initial conditions consistent with initial matter domination ( if this requirement is fulfilled then the results do not depend on the specific initial conditions ) , and we fix @xmath23 in order to acquire @xmath106 and @xmath107 at present .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1phi ] we present the ratios of the zeroth ( tracker ) and first order field solutions to the exact numerical value , that is @xmath108 and @xmath109 , as a function of the redshift .",
    "the calculations have been performed for three potential cases , namely @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . as we observe , @xmath108 is very close to @xmath74 for @xmath1 , that is the tracker solution is a very good approximation at this early evolution stage . for @xmath113",
    "the zeroth order solution is not a good approximation ( with error @xmath114 ) but the first order one remains within @xmath115 accuracy ( with even better results for larger @xmath116 values ) .",
    "however , after that stage , the phantom cosmological effects become significant and our approximation breaks down rapidly .",
    "similarly , in fig . [ fig2om ] we present @xmath117 and @xmath118 versus z.    the divergence of the zeroth order solution from the exact one starts at @xmath119 .",
    "however , as we observe , the first order solution is very accurate ( with error less than @xmath0 ) up to @xmath120 .",
    "after that point , the first order solution starts diverging rapidly from the exact one and our approximation is not valid .",
    "the fact that at @xmath121 in some cases ( large @xmath116 ) the zeroth order solution seems to be closer to the exact evolution comparing to the first order one , is a result of the signs of the corresponding terms ( namely positive @xmath85 and negative @xmath86 ) , but it has no meaning since our approximations are not valid in that regime .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig3w ] we depict @xmath122 and @xmath123 as a function of the redshift .    as we see , the tracker solution is very accurate up to @xmath124 , while the first order one agrees with the exact evolution within @xmath0 up to @xmath125 .    in summary , we observe that the tracker ( zeroth order ) solution is accurate within an error of @xmath0 at early times and up to @xmath119 . at intermediate times",
    "we have to use the first order analytical solution , which agrees with the exact cosmological evolution within an error of @xmath0 up to @xmath2 .",
    "after that point , the phantom dark energy sector enhances , it dominates the cosmological evolution , and our approximation breaks down rapidly .",
    "since we have tested the accuracy of our analytical expressions and we have determined their applicability region , one can use them to describe an arbitrary phantom evolution in power - law potentials up to @xmath126 . here",
    "we will present some additional applications concerning observable quantities .",
    "having extracted expressions for @xmath105 and @xmath104 which are valid up to low redshifts , we can derive the corresponding @xmath127 relation .",
    "indeed , using ( [ rhophizero ] ) , ( [ wtilde ] ) and ( [ omtilde ] ) we result to @xmath128 thus , at early times , where phantom energy density ( that is @xmath129 ) is negligible , @xmath88 is equal to a constant value , namely @xmath67 . at intermediate times",
    "it increases linearly with @xmath129 . comparing with the corresponding result for quintessence in inverse power - law potentials",
    "@xcite there are two differences .",
    "firstly , @xmath127 is an increasing function instead of a decreasing one .",
    "secondly , since @xmath25 lies now in the interval @xmath130 , the slope is not a slowly - varying function of @xmath25 but it ranges from @xmath131 at @xmath132 to @xmath133 at @xmath134 .",
    "finally , one can examine the accuracy of expression ( [ womega ] ) by comparing it to the exact evolution .",
    "indeed , we find that it is very satisfactory ( with an error of less than @xmath0 ) up to @xmath2 ( or equivalently up to @xmath135 ) , and then the error grows reaching to @xmath136 at @xmath121 .    additionally , and similarly to @xcite , we can use expression ( [ wtilde ] ) for @xmath137 in order to acquire a parametrization for @xmath138 for redshifts up to @xmath2 , where our approximation is still valid .",
    "indeed we find the same result with @xcite , namely : @xmath139 with the obvious difference that now the undetermined parameter @xmath140 , which is just the present value of @xmath88 , is smaller than @xmath141 .",
    "this fit for phantom evolution in power - law potentials proves to be satisfactory within an error of @xmath142 .",
    "finally , one can examine ( [ wfit ] ) in parallel with the phenomenological parametrization @xmath143 of @xcite , where he finds that the two expressions have a comparable level of accuracy @xcite .",
    "in this work we have investigated phantom models with power - law potentials .",
    "we have extracted the tracker solutions under the assumption of matter domination , that is the general solution and common behavior of all such models at early times , that is at high redshifts . due to the nature of phantom fields , which present an `` inverse '' kinetic behavior in potential slopes , we find that total energy positivity requires normal power - law potentials instead of inverse power - law ones ( contrary to quintessence case ) , with the potential exponent being bounded by the quadratic form .",
    "furthermore , we have extracted the general cosmological solution at intermediate times , that is at low redshifts , which is the period during the transition from matter to dark - energy domination .",
    "such a solution can be very useful in dark energy observations , since these ( supernovae ia , wmap and sdss ones ) are related to this cosmological period @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the analytic expressions with the exact evolution arising from numerical elaboration , shows that the tracker solution agrees with the later within @xmath0 for redshifts @xmath1 , while the first order solution is accurate within @xmath0 up to @xmath2 .",
    "in the aforementioned analysis we have not used observations in order to further restrict the potential form , desiring to remain general .",
    "however , from the @xmath105 expression derived in ( [ wtilde ] ) we conclude that smaller values of @xmath116 are favored if we want to acquire a @xmath88 at @xmath126 which is not too negative , consistently with observations within 2@xmath144 .",
    "note also that smaller @xmath116-values facilitate and enhance the total energy positivity .",
    "finally , we have to make a comment about the quantum behavior of the examined model . as it is known , the discussion about the construction of quantum field theory of phantoms is still open in the literature .",
    "for instance in @xcite the authors reveal the causality and stability problems and the possible spontaneous breakdown of the vacuum into phantoms and conventional particles . on the other hand ,",
    "there have also been serious attempts in overcoming these difficulties and construct a phantom theory consistent with the basic requirements of quantum field theory @xcite , with the phantom fields arising as an effective description .",
    "the present analysis is just a first approach on phantom fields in power - law potentials . definitely , the subject of quantization of such models is open and needs further investigation .",

    "<S> we investigate phantom models with power - law potentials and we extract the early - time , `` tracker '' , solutions under the assumption of matter domination . contrary to quintessence case , we find that energy positivity requires normal power - law potentials instead of inverse power - law ones , with the potential exponent being bounded by the quadratic form . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we analytically present the general cosmological solution at intermediate times , that is at low redshifts , which is the period of the transition from matter to dark - energy domination . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with the exact evolution , arising from numerical elaboration , shows that the tracker solution agrees with the later within @xmath0 for redshifts @xmath1 , while the intermediate solution is accurate within @xmath0 up to @xmath2 . </S>"
