    "spin - orbit coupling has long been known to be essential to account for the band structure of semiconductors , say , semiconductors with the zink - blende crystalline structure .",
    "monographs have been dedicated to reviewing the effects of the spin - orbit coupling on the bloch bands of conductors and semiconductors @xcite .",
    "electronic transport properties of metals and semiconductors in which impurities are coupled to the conduction electrons by the spin - orbit coupling , i.e. , when the impurities preserve the time - reversal symmetry but break the spin - rotation symmetry , are also well understood since the prediction of weak antilocalization effects @xcite .",
    "hence , the prediction of the quantum spin hall effect in two - dimensional semiconductors with time - reversal symmetry but a sufficiently strong breaking of spin - rotation symmetry is rather remarkable in view of the maturity of the field dedicated to the physics of semiconductors @xcite . the quantum spin hall effect was observed in hgte/(hg , cd)te quantum wells two years later @xcite .",
    "even more remarkably , this rapid progress was followed by the prediction of three - dimensional topological insulators @xcite and its experimental confirmation for bi - based compounds @xcite .",
    "the quantum spin hall effect , like its relative , the quantum ( electric charge ) hall effect , can be understood either as a property of the two - dimensional bulk or as a property of the one - dimensional boundary .",
    "the bulk can be characterized by certain integrals over the brillouin zone of berry connections calculated from bloch eigenstates .",
    "these integrals are only allowed to take discrete values and are examples of topological invariants from the mathematical literature .",
    "as is well known , the topological number @xmath1 takes integer values for the quantum ( electric charge ) hall effect @xcite .",
    "by contrast , it takes only two distinct values ( @xmath2 or 1 ) for time - reversal invariant , @xmath3 topological band insulators @xcite .",
    "because they are quantized , they can not change under a small continuous deformation of the hamiltonian , including a perturbation that breaks translation invariance , i.e. , disorder .",
    "the bulk topological quantum numbers are closely connected with the existence of stable gapless edge states along the boundary of a topological insulator , or more precisely along the interface between two insulators with different topological numbers .",
    "the number of gapless edge modes is determined by the difference of the topological numbers . on the edge of a two - dimensional @xmath0 topological band insulator with @xmath4 ,",
    "there exists helical edge states , a kramers pair of counter propagating modes , which interpolates between the bulk valence band and the bulk conduction band .",
    "if one changes the fermi energy from the center of the band gap to lower energies through the conduction band , one should observe a transition from a @xmath0 topological insulator to a metal , and then from a metal to a trivial band insulator ( @xmath2 ) without helical edge states .",
    "since both helical edge states and a metallic phase are stable against ( weak ) disorder ( due to the quantized topological number and to weak anti - localization , respectively ) , the same sequence of phases should appear as the fermi energy is varied even in the presence of disorder , as confirmed recently by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "a question one can naturally ask is then whether there is any difference between the critical phenomena at the metal - to-@xmath0-topological - insulator transition and those at the metal - to - trivial - insulator transition .",
    "this is the question which we revisit in this paper , extending our previous studies @xcite .",
    "it will become clear that one needs to distinguish between bulk and boundary properties in the universal critical phenomena .    for the quantum ( electric charge ) hall effect",
    ", the chalker - coddington network model serves as a standard model for studying critical properties at anderson transition between different quantum hall states  @xcite .",
    "the elementary object in the chalker - coddington network model is chiral edge states .",
    "these edge states are plane waves propagating along the links of each plaquette which represents a puddle of a quantum hall droplet formed in the presence of spatially slowly varying potential .",
    "they are chiral as they represent the mode propagating along equipotential lines in the direction determined by the external magnetic field .",
    "the chalker - coddington network model is a unitary scattering matrix that scales in size with the number of links defining the network , and with a deterministic parameter that quantifies the relative probability for an incoming mode to scatter into a link rotated by @xmath5 or @xmath6 . by tuning this parameter through the value @xmath7",
    ", one can go through a transition from one insulating phase to another insulating phase , with the topological number @xmath1 changed by one .",
    "this remains true even when the phase of an edge state along any link is taken to be an independent random number to mimic the effects of static local disorder .",
    "the chalker - coddington model is a powerful tool to characterize the effects of static disorder on the direct transition between two successive integer quantum hall states .",
    "it has demonstrated that this transition is continuous and several critical exponents at this transition have been measured from the chalker - coddington model @xcite .",
    "the present authors have constructed in @xcite a generalization of the chalker - coddington model that describes the physics of the two - dimensional quantum spin hall effect .",
    "we shall call this network model the @xmath0 network model , which will be briefly reviewed in section 2 . as with the chalker - coddington model ,",
    "edge states propagate along the links of each plaquette of the square lattice . unlike the chalker - coddington model",
    "there are two edge states per link that form a single kramers doublet , which corresponds to helical edge states moving along a puddle of a quantum spin hall droplet .",
    "kramers doublets undergo the most general unitary scattering compatible with time - reversal symmetry at the nodes of the square lattice .",
    "the @xmath0 network model is thus a unitary scattering matrix that scales in size with the number of links defining the network and that preserves time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0 network model supports one metallic phase and two insulating phases , as we discussed earlier .",
    "the metallic phase prevents any direct transition between the insulating phases and the continuous phase transition between the metallic and any of the insulating phases belongs to the two - dimensional symplectic universality class of anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that bulk properties at metal - insulator transition in the @xmath0 network model are the same as those at conventional metal - insulator transitions in the two - dimensional symplectic symmetry class @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can understand this result from the following general argument based on universality .",
    "the non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) description is a very powerful , standard theoretical approach to anderson metal - insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "a nlsm can have a topological term if the homotopy group of the target manifold , which is determined by the symmetry of the system at hand , is nontrivial .",
    "interestingly , in the case of the symplectic symmetry class , as is called the statistical ensemble of systems ( including quantum spin hall systems ) that are invariant under time reversal but are not invariant under su(2 ) spin rotation , the nlsm admits a @xmath3 topological term @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nlsm in the symplectic symmetry class with a @xmath0 topological term can not support an insulating phase .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that this nlsm describes surface dirac fermions of a three - dimensional @xmath0 topological insulator which are topologically protected from anderson localization @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that any two - dimensional metal - insulator transition in time - reversal - invariant but spin - rotation - noninvariant systems should be in the same and unique universality class that is encoded by the nlsm without a topological term in the ( ordinary ) symplectic class .    whereas bulk critical properties at the transition between a metal and a @xmath0 topological insulator do not depend on the topological nature of the insulating phase , there are boundary properties that can distinguish between a topologically trivial and non - trivial insulating phases .",
    "boundary multifractality is a very convenient tool to probe any discrepancy between universal bulk and boundary properties at anderson transition  @xcite . to probe this difference ,",
    "the present authors performed a multifractal analysis of the edge states that propagate from one end to the other in a network model at criticality with open boundary condition in the transverse direction  @xcite .",
    "it was found that boundary multifractal exponents are sensitive to the presence or absence of a helical kramers doublet propagating along the boundary .",
    "the goal of this paper is 2-fold :    1 .",

    ", we shall characterize the @xmath0 insulating phases in the @xmath8 dirac hamiltonian by a @xmath0 topological invariant .",

    ", this should remove any lingering doubts that the metal - insulator transition between a two - dimensional metallic state and a two - dimensional @xmath0 insulator that is driven by static disorder is anything but conventional .    for item  ( [ enu 2 ] )",

    "second , we consider the case of figure [ fig : geometry_mix](b ) in which there are again two point contacts , however each lead between the @xmath0 network model and the reservoir now supports two instead of one kramers doublets .",
    "the two point - contact scattering matrices connecting the @xmath0 network model to the reservoirs are now @xmath8 matrices , which leads to a non - vanishing probability of backscattering .",
    "hence , this even channel two - point - contact conductance is expected to decay as a function of the separation between the two attachment points of the leads to the network .    to test whether the two - point - contact conductance in figure [ fig : geometry_mix](a ) and figure [ fig : geometry_mix](b ) do differ as dramatically as anticipated , we have computed numerically the two - point - contact conductance at the quantum critical point @xmath365 for a _ single realization _ of the static disorder .",

    "it is evidently @xmath367 independent and unity , as expected .",
    "figure [ fig : delta_corner_mix](a ) also shows with the symbol @xmath369 the dependence on @xmath367 of the dimensionless two - point conductance @xmath368 for leads supporting two kramers doublet as depicted in figure [ fig : geometry_mix](b ) . although it is not possible to establish a monotonous decay of the two - point - contact conductance for a single realization of the static disorder , its strong fluctuations as @xmath367 is varied are consistent with this claim .",
    "we turn our attention to the closed geometry shown in figure [ fig : geometry_mix](c ) .",
    "we recall that it is expected on general grounds that the moments of the two - point conductance in a network model at criticality , when the point contacts are far apart , decay as power laws with scaling exponents proportional to the scaling exponents @xmath307 @xcite . consequently , after tuning the @xmath0 network model to criticality , the anomalous dimensions at the node ( corner ) where the boundary condition is changed must vanish , @xmath370 since the two - point - contact conductance in figure [ fig : geometry_mix](a ) is @xmath367 independent . (",
    "[ eq : delta(0,t|o)=0 ] ) is another signature of the nontrivial topological nature of the insulating side at the anderson transition that we want to test numerically .",
    "thus , we consider the geometry figure [ fig : geometry_mix](c ) and compute numerically the corner anomalous dimensions .",
    "this is done using the amplitudes of the stationary wave function restricted to the links connecting the two corners where the boundary conditions are changed .",
    "figure [ fig : delta_corner_mix](b ) shows the numerical value of the corner anomalous dimension @xmath371 .",

    "we observe that @xmath371 is zero within the error bars , thereby confirming the validity of the prediction ( [ eq : delta(0,t|o)=0 ] ) at the metal - to-@xmath0-topological - insulator transition .",
