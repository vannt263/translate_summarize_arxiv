    "this article examines propagating nonlinear localized modes in crystalline materials .",
    "these modes are commonly referred to as propagating discrete breathers , i.e.  waves contained within a bell - shaped envelope exhibiting internal oscillations of frequencies outside the phonon band .",
    "there is strong interest in such breather solutions , as they provide possible mechanisms underpinning physical phenomena , for example the formation of long decorated dark lines in muscovite mica @xcite , a possible mechanism for high temperature superconductivity @xcite , and the development of next generation plasma fusion reactors @xcite .",
    "laboratory and numerical experiments provide evidence for such coherent localized phenomena @xcite .",
    "the existence of dark lines in muscovite mica crystals was first highlighted by russell some twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "although some of these lines were thought to be formed by cosmic rays , the fact that many of the lines follow crystallographic axes was puzzling .",
    "russell was unable to find a suitable linear theory for such phenomena and suggested the possibility of nonlinear localized modes .",
    "he called these `` quodons '' as they appeared to be connected to a symmetry feature of the axes which he called quasi - one - dimensionality , for which displacement of an atom along the axis direction was met by a force acting along the same line ( technically this is @xmath0 symmetry ) . in this paper",
    "we use the term quasi - one - dimensional to refer both to this type of symmetry and to the fact that the observed mobile pulses seem to be highly localized along one of the crystallographic axes .",
    "the two effects are believed to be related @xcite , although the exact mechanism is not clear .",
    "the active component in the mica case seems to be the 2d hexagonal layer of k atoms sandwiched between two relatively rigid silicate layers .",
    "such a symmetry feature may be also associated with many of the materials having high @xmath1 superconductivity properties @xcite , although in this case the underlying 2d layers have a higher cubic rather than hexagonal symmetry .",
    "more tenuous suggestions that localized modes could lead to enhanced fusion rates in deuterated crystals have also been put forward @xcite .",
    "more generally , there is increasing interest in single 2d hexagonal crystals such as graphene @xcite and other layered structures that could be built from the two - dimensional atomic crystals based on graphene geometries @xcite .",
    "an open question is what role both stationary and mobile localized modes can play in such structures .    due to advances in computer power and better understanding of molecular dynamics algorithms @xcite ,",
    "we are now well equipped for numerical study of discrete breathers in higher dimensional dynamical lattices .",
    "there is a good theoretical and numerical understanding of existence of stationary discrete breathers @xcite , that is , spatially localized time - periodic excitations .",
    "the same can not be said about mobile discrete breathers in 1d and higher dimensional dynamical lattices @xcite .",
    "there are still open theoretical questions regarding the existence of propagating discrete breathers in general nonintegrable lattices .",
    "there are a few exceptions such as the ablowitz - ladik chain @xcite , which is an integrable model .",
    "thus we must rely on numerical studies of propagating localized modes , the main focus of this paper .",
    "in addition , we propose here a 2d model with a lower level of complexity for future analytical investigations .    in their work , marn et al .",
    "@xcite showed numerically for the first time the existence of propagating localized modes ( discrete breathers ) in a 2d dynamical hexagonal nonlinear lattice .",
    "they extended their results to a 2d cubic lattice in @xcite .",
    "their lattices were subject to a nearest neighbour anharmonic interparticle interaction potential and an on - site potential .",
    "their model represents a 2d nonlinear lattice when embedded in a surrounding 3d lattice and as such can be thought of as a 2d layer model of a 3d layered crystal lattice .",
    "examples of such crystals are cuprates , the copper - oxide based high temperature superconductors , with cubic symmetry , and muscovite mica , a potassium based silicate insulators , with hexagonal symmetry .",
    "the study @xcite was limited by available computer power and hence only to models of @xmath2 and @xmath3 lattices sizes ( i.e. @xmath4 lattice sites ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this numerical study confirmed the existence of propagating highly localized quasi - one - dimensional discrete breathers propagating in crystallographic directions .",
    "the quasi - one - dimensional nature of the discrete breathers suggests that they may exist in crystals containing any 1d chains with @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the present paper explores the hexagonal model in much greater detail , using a much larger computational domain to simulate a system of up to @xmath6 lattice sites .",
    "using somewhat smaller 2d domains but with periodic boundary conditions , we are able to track a breather traversing one million lattice sites . our study shows frequency sharpening effects in both 1d and 2d , which were not observed in the paper of marin et al .",
    "moreover , we obtain a better understanding of the 2d qualitative nature of these quasi - one - dimensional propagating breathers .",
    "for the theory stated above to be a proper representation of physical reality , discrete breathers must travel long distances , i.e.  one or more millimeters , if we are to associate them with the creation of dark lines in mica and to give numerical support for sputtering experiment carried out by russell et al .",
    "@xcite . in this experiment , a specimen of muscovite mica of size @xmath7 mm .  in thickness and @xmath87 mm .  across",
    "the @xmath9-face was subject to low energy alpha particle bombardment at one end of the crystal .",
    "the experiment showed that particles were emitted at the opposite face of the specimen in the crystallographic directions of the potassium layer of muscovite .",
    "the potassium layer is thought to be the layer where discrete breathers could have propagated @xcite . in general discrete breathers are not _ a priori _ expected to be long - lived since the lattice models considered are likely to be nonintegrable . in addition , their lifespan is subject to interactions with defects and with the phonon background , which may be viewed as thermal noise .",
    "the experiment by russell et al .",
    "@xcite showed the transport of energy over more than @xmath10 lattice sites at about @xmath11k ( room temperature ) .",
    "an obvious challenge is to demonstrate the existence of long - lived propagating discrete breather solutions using a theoretical model to understand their role in the transport of energy in sputtering experiments and formation of the dark lines in mica .",
    "the simulations of marn et al .",
    "@xcite were done on small lattices with periodic boundary conditions : the longest distance of breather travel was reported to be @xmath12 lattice sites ( i.e.  traversing the periodic lattice many times ) before the wave collapsed .",
    "their results suggest that the discrete breathers are sensitive to small scale interactions with phonon background , i.e.  thermal noise may turn propagating modes into stationary ones , or scatter their energy into the lattice , and thus lifetimes were insufficient to support the experimental results of russell et al @xcite . on the other hand",
    "this does not preclude the existence of long - lived propagating breather solutions when the right conditions are met , since the study by cretegny et al.@xcite showed that phonons may turn stationary breathers into a mobile one .",
    "the paper @xcite used a lattice configuration in its dynamical equilibrium state for the initial conditions , while additionally exciting three atoms in one of the crystallographic direction with positive - negative - positive or vice versa initial velocity conditions . with these initial conditions they were able to create a propagating breather solution together with low amplitude phonons which spread into the domain and continued to interact with the propagating breather",
    "thus these interactions could be responsible for the collapse of propagating discrete breather .    the model in @xcite",
    "was highly restricted in that it incorporated only nearest neighbour interactions between potassium atoms , with the atoms confined to their unit cells .",
    "thus they were not able to study kink solutions in a 2d hexagonal lattice .",
    "the objective of this paper is to eliminate this constraint , to allow short and long range interactions between potassium atoms and perform a conceptual numerical study of long - lived breather solutions .",
    "the current approach also allows us to study kink solutions in a 2d hexagonal lattice .",
    "the paper is organised in the following way . in section [ sec : mathmod ] we consider in detail the theoretical model we use in our study .",
    "we derive a dimensionless set of equations in sec.[sec : dimsyst ] , and in sec .  [",
    "sec : lineq ] we investigate the linearised system and derive the linearised dispersion relation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numsim ] we report on a number of numerical simulations of long - lived breathers in our model system .",
    "section [ sec : kinks ] is devoted to a brief discussion of simulations of kink solutions , which do not appear to travel long distances in the present model .",
    "some mathematical details are presented in two appendices .",
    "in this section we describe a 2d mathematical k - k sheet layer model of muscovite mica crystal .",
    "we model the potassium layer of mica of @xmath13 potassium atoms by classical hamiltonian dynamics with the hamiltonian : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the kinetic energy , @xmath16 is the on - site potential energy encompassing forces from the silicate layers of atoms above and below the potassium k - k sheet , and @xmath17 is the radial interaction potential between the potassium atoms . in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) , @xmath18 is the 2d position vector of the @xmath19 potassium atom with mass @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is its time derivative .",
    "the symbol @xmath22 refers to the euclidean two - norm of a vector @xmath23 , i.e.  its length .",
    "the potassium k - k sheet of muscovite mica crystal is compactly sandwiched between rigid layers of silicon - oxygen tetrahedra which enforces hexagonal lattice symmetry on potassium atoms @xcite .",
    "marn et al .",
    "@xcite considered the rigid silicon - oxygen layer approximation and anharmonic interaction morse forces between free potassium and fixed oxygen atoms to obtain an on - site force as a superposition of these forces for each site . in this paper",
    "we adopt a simpler approach and consider a periodic smooth on - site potential with hexagonal symmetry from @xcite .",
    "this can be thought of as a generalization of a discrete 1d sine - gordon lattice to a two dimensions with hexagonal symmetry .",
    "the on - site potential function resembles an egg - box carton and can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the lattice constant , i.e.  the equilibrium distance between potassium atoms , and @xmath26 is the maximal value of the on - site potential .",
    "note that a simple product of cosine functions would not provide the required hexagonal symmetry . in figure",
    "[ fig : onsitea ] , we plot the on - site potential function ( [ onsitefunc ] ) with sixteen sites , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in figure",
    "[ fig : onsiteb ] we show potassium atoms in their dynamical equilibrium states together with their labels in @xmath29 coordinates .",
    "we will adopt these labels and notation in secs .",
    "[ sec : lineq ] and [ sec : numsim ] .    for further reference and analysis",
    "we write down the harmonic approximation to an on - site potential well @xmath30 where @xmath31 are any local minima , equilibrium states , of the on - site potential ( [ onsitefunc ] ) , see fig .  [",
    "fig : onsite ] .    for small atomic displacements , each potassium atom k will remain in each particular site .",
    "this was imposed as a global constraint in @xcite with nearest neighbour interactions . in our approach",
    "we can allow atoms to move from one site to another .",
    "in addition , the on - site potential ( [ onsitefunc ] ) provides a simpler implementation , since function ( [ onsitefunc ] ) is periodic and defined on all of @xmath32 . in the 1d approximation , i.e.  @xmath33constant ,",
    "this on - site potential ( [ onsitefunc ] ) reduces to the cosine function which is the on - site potential of the discrete sine - gordon equation and a periodic potential of the 1d model considered in @xcite . the model in @xcite could be thought as a 1d approximation of the 2d model ( [ hamilt ] ) . to see that , without loss of generality , consider @xmath34 in the equation ( [ onsitefunc ] ) which leads to the cosine function in the 1d approximation .",
    "the same holds true for other two crystallographic lattice directions .",
    "the hexagonal lattice , as demonstrated in fig.[fig : onsiteb ] , has three crystallographic lattice directions which can be prescribed by the direction cosine vectors : @xmath35 and @xmath36 .      in this section",
    "we describe an empirical interaction potential to model the atomic interactions of potassium atoms in the k - k sheet of mica .",
    "essentially , from a modelling point of view , we are concerned with anharmonic radial interaction potentials @xmath37 parametrized by @xmath38 , the depth of the potential well , i.e.  @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , the equilibrium distance , i.e.  @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , we require that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are monotonically increasing functions for @xmath44 and @xmath45 such that @xmath46 as a first step to understanding the properties of the crystalline solids in this model , it is natural to consider the short - ranged scaled lennard - jones interaction potential @xmath47 where @xmath25 coincide with the lattice constant in the on - site potential ( [ onsitefunc ] ) , @xmath48 for all @xmath49 and @xmath50 . recall that the term @xmath51 describes long range attractive van der waals force and the term @xmath52 models pauli short range repulsive forces .",
    "other possible models are the morse potential and the buckingham potential , among others .",
    "the lennard - jones potential ( [ ljpot ] ) has the asymptotic properties ( [ properties ] ) . to increase the efficiency of the numerical computations , and to provide a suitable model for nearest neighbour interactions , we introduce an additional parameter in the potential ( [ ljpot ] ) , that is , a cut - off radius @xmath53 . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with a close range interaction model , i.e.  @xmath54 , which resembles but is not restricted to the fixed nearest neighbour interaction model .",
    "we compared our numerical results to longer ranged interaction simulations , that is , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and did not observe any qualitative differences in our results .",
    "we attribute this to the asymptotic properties ( [ properties ] ) of the lennard - jones potential ( [ ljpot ] ) .",
    "to incorporate the cut - off radius , we set potential and forces to zero for all atomic distances larger than @xmath53 .",
    "for smooth cut - off computations we proceed in a similar manner as presented in @xcite . instead of only two polynomial terms",
    ", we add five additional even order polynomial terms to the interaction potential @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 where the cut - off dimensionless coefficients @xmath59 when @xmath60 and are determined from the following five conditions : @xmath61    in the definition of the cut - off potential ( [ cutpot ] ) , we only consider even power polynomial terms of the atomic radius @xmath62 such that we do not need to compute square roots of atomic distances in the simulations .",
    "the particular choice of conditions ( [ cond ] ) implies that the harmonic approximation of the cut - off potential ( [ cutpot ] ) is equal to the harmonic potential approximation of @xmath57 : @xmath63 thus the linear analysis of the system for the nearest neighbour interactions with potential @xmath64 is equivalent to the linear analysis of the system with the original potential @xmath57 .    in [ app :",
    "a ] , we give exact formulas for the cut - off coefficients @xmath65 of an arbitrary potential @xmath57 satisfying the following properties : @xmath66 and @xmath67 when @xmath68 .",
    "the lennard - jones potential ( [ ljpot ] ) satisfies these two properties . in figure",
    "[ fig : interacta ] we compare the lennard - jones potential ( [ ljpot ] ) with the lennard - jones potential with cut - off radius @xmath54 computed by ( [ cutpot ] ) .",
    "due to the construction , the potential well is very well preserved despite the additional polynomial terms in the potential . with figure [ fig : interactb ]",
    "we confirm that the cut - off coefficients @xmath65 tend to zero when the cut - off radius @xmath53 tends to infinity .",
    "thus in the limit we recover the original lennard - jones potential ( [ ljpot ] ) .",
    "in this section we derive a dimensionless system of equations .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) with the on - site potential ( [ onsitefunc ] ) and the interaction potential ( [ cutpot ] ) , that is , a system with total energy @xmath69 where @xmath70 and the potentials are represented with their set of parameters and variables .",

    "dropping the bars over the variables , except for the parameter @xmath83 , the dimensionless dynamical system of equations is @xmath84 for all @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the momentum . in the following we consider the dimensionless system ( [ systm ] ) in our analysis and computations .",
    "the dimensionless system of equations ( [ systm ] ) contains two dimensionless parameters @xmath83 and @xmath53 , and cut - off coefficients @xmath65 which depend on cut - off radius @xmath53 . independently from the value of @xmath53 , when @xmath87 there is no interaction forces between potassium atoms and the system ( [ systm ] ) decouples into a system of nonlinear oscillators .",
    "when the value of @xmath83 tends to infinity , interaction forces dominate over the forces from the on - site potential , and in this case the equations describe a lennard - jones fluid . to find a suitable range for parameter @xmath83 values such that both potentials have relatively equal strength , we compute and compare unrelaxed potentials seen by a potassium atom moving in any of the three lattice directions . in other words",
    "we fix all neighbouring atoms of a particular k atom and compute potential energies for small atomic displacements of the atom in any of three lattice directions , see fig .",

    "we find fig .",

    "in this section we derive a nearest neighbour elastic spring interaction model of ( [ systm ] ) and its dispersion relation . recall that the cut - off coefficients @xmath65 are chosen such that @xmath96 , see conditions ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "we consider the atom @xmath97 with labels @xmath98 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : onsiteb ] , and its six neighbouring atoms with labels @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "note that @xmath115 and @xmath116 are constant when only nearest neighbour lennard - jones interactions are considered and recall that the harmonic approximation of the on - site potential ( [ onsitefunc ] ) is given by ( [ onsitefuncappr ] ) . by dropping index @xmath98 from matrix @xmath117 and replacing index @xmath103 with the six neighbouring labels of atoms with labels @xmath118 from fig.[fig : onsiteb ] , we obtain a system of dynamical linear equations @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the displacement vector from the equilibrium state of atom @xmath118 and @xmath121 after time rescaling @xmath122 . in [ app : b ] we give exact expressions for matrices @xmath123 and system ( [ linsyst ] ) in component - wise form , which are in exact agreement with the linearised equations of the morse hexagonal lattice with an on - site harmonic potential presented in @xcite .",
    "we argue here that the equation ( [ linsyst ] ) with linear interaction forces together with the egg - box on - site potential ( [ onsitefunc ] ) , instead of a harmonic on - site potential ( [ onsitefuncappr ] ) is a 2d model with lower level of complexity and could be used as a starting point for analytical investigations .",
    "in particular , it may be possible to develop an existence proof for propagating localized modes in this model .",
    "the proposed model can be thought as a natural extension of the discrete sine - gordon equation in two dimensions with hexagonal symmetry .",
    "similarly a square lattice could be considered .",
    "following the approach of @xcite , we derive a dispersion relation from the simple wave solutions @xmath124 where @xmath125 is an amplitude , @xmath126 is the wave number , and @xmath127 is a frequency in the @xmath128 time scale .",
    "explicit calculations give the linear system matrix for @xmath129 in ( [ linsyst ] ) @xmath130 see [ app : b ] .",
