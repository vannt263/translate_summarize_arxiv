    "<S> violation of the slow - roll condition by these mass terms is known as the @xmath5-problem . from this viewpoint , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-term inflation is an attractive scenario , because the inflaton field does not gain such a large mass if the @xmath0-term is dominant during inflation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term plays a role as the potential energy in @xmath0-term inflation models .    </S>",
    "<S> the fi term is generated through anomalous @xmath1 symmetries in four - dimensional string models . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , most of four - dimensional string models have anomalous @xmath1 s for both heterotic string models @xcite and type i string models @xcite . these anomalies can be cancelled by the green - schwarz ( gs ) mechanism @xcite , where certain fields transform non - linearly under anomalous @xmath1 symmetries . in heterotic string models , </S>",
    "<S> the gauge kinetic function @xmath6 is obtained by the dilaton field s as @xmath7 up to kac - moody levels , that is , the gauge coupling @xmath8 is determined by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath9 as @xmath10 . under the anomalous @xmath1 transformation , </S>",
    "<S> the dilaton field @xmath9 transforms nonlinearly as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a parameter of the anomalous @xmath1 transformation and the anomaly coefficient @xmath13 is obtained as symmetries . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 with the summation of anomalous @xmath1 charges , tr @xmath15 . that generates the dilaton - dependent fi term @xmath16 in the unit of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the first derivative of the klher potential @xmath19 with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath20 denotes the reduced planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter we use the unit @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , it seems possible to embed the @xmath0-term inflation scenario in string models . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have problems . </S>",
    "<S> one of problems is due to the fact that the fi term @xmath22 and anomalous @xmath1 gauge coupling @xmath8 depend on @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the tree - level khler potential of @xmath9 is obtained as @xmath23 with this form of the khler potential , the @xmath0-term scalar potential @xmath24 during inflation behaves @xmath25 . only with this term </S>",
    "<S> , the dilaton rolls down rapidly the potential to infinity , @xmath26 , and the potential energy goes to zero , @xmath27 . the slow roll condition or the @xmath0-term inflation can not be realized . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the first problem is how to stabilize the dilaton field during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the dilaton can be stabilized by adding the @xmath4-term scalar potential due to dilaton - dependent nonperturbative superpotential terms @xcite .- </S>",
    "<S> term inflation of type i models , one can stabilize twisted moduli , which determine fi terms @xcite . ]    the second problem is concerned about the magnitude of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the gs coefficient @xmath13 is model - dependent , and explicit models lead to @xmath28 @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the magnitude of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) requires @xmath29 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , explicit heterotic string models seem to have much larger value of the fi term @xmath22 . until now </S>",
    "<S> , just a few models leading to effectively small @xmath22 have been studied @xcite , this seems still an open question . </S>",
    "<S> another way out of this problem is to consider @xmath0-term inflation in type i string models @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another problem is the generation of cosmic strings in the true vacuum after inflation . </S>",
    "<S> its string tension is estimated as the fi term @xmath22 in the true vacuum . if @xmath30 gev in the true vacuum , cosmic strings besides inflaton lead to the density perturbation , which is not consistent with the cmb observation @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we will study these problems in models with nonperturbative khler potential of the dilaton field , in particular , the stabilization problem and how to reduce the magnitude of the fi term . in the true vacuum </S>",
    "<S> , the dilaton stabilization has been studied in models with its nonperturbative khler potential in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in ref . @xcite it has been shown that one can stabilize @xmath9 with nonperturbative khler potential in the true vacuum such that @xmath31 and @xmath18 is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> that corresponds to a suppressed value of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , here we investigate the possibility for stabilizing @xmath9 such that @xmath18 and @xmath22 are suppressed during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we will also comment on the cosmic strings .    </S>",
    "<S> first , let us review briefly on the @xmath0-term inflation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a simple model with @xmath1 gauge symmetry and the non - vanishing fi term @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this model includes three matter fields , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and @xmath33 have @xmath1 charges @xmath34 and @xmath32 has no @xmath1 charge . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 @xmath0-term is written as @xmath35 here we take the charge normalization such that @xmath36 . in addition , we assume the following superpotential , @xmath37 then , the scalar potential is written as @xmath38    the true vacuum corresponds to @xmath39 in order to analyze the minimum of @xmath40 for a value of @xmath32 fixed , we define @xmath41 , @xmath42 for @xmath43 , the minimum corresponds to @xmath44 on the other hand , for @xmath45 , the minimum corresponds to @xmath46 in the latter case , the potential energy is obtained as @xmath47 and drives the inflationary expansion of the universe , where the radial part of @xmath32 is identified with the inflaton . at the tree level , the inflaton @xmath32 has the flat potential . </S>",
    "<S> the supersymmetry ( susy ) is broken during inflation because of the non - vanishing @xmath0-term and the scalar components of @xmath33 have masses squared , @xmath48 here the second term is the susy breaking mass squared by non - vanishing @xmath0-term , while the first term is the supersymmetric mass squared , which fermionic partners also have . </S>",
    "<S> these mass splitting generates the one - loop effective potential , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the renormalization scale . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the potential for @xmath32 is slightly lifted , and the inflaton @xmath32 slowly rolls down the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the inflation ends when @xmath32 reaches at @xmath41 or @xmath51 , @xmath52 where the slow roll condition is violated .    </S>",
    "<S> next , let us consider the @xmath0-term inflation scenario from the viewpoint of 4d effective theory of string theory . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use the tree - level khler potential ( [ tree - k ] ) and the gauge kinetic function ( [ gauge - fn ] ) . since the fi term and the gauge coupling are replaced with @xmath9-dependent fi term ( [ fi - s ] ) and @xmath53 respectively , the scalar potential during inflation ( [ vd - inf ] ) is rewritten as @xmath54 now </S>",
    "<S> , two problems we mentioned above become clear . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is that only with this potential the dilaton rapidly runs away to infinity , @xmath26 , and the inflation can not be realized . in ref.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the dilaton stabilization has been studied by adding the @xmath4-term scalar potential generated by gaugino condensation as well as non - vanishing flux of the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the second problem is that the scale of the potential energy is too high to produce the density perturbation with an appropriate magnitude as long as @xmath31 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> these problems will be studied in our models with nonperturbative khler potential .    in ref.@xcite , the possibility for suppressing @xmath18 has been studied by taking account of nonperturbative effects on khler potential . </S>",
    "<S> actually , if we have additional terms in the khler potential @xmath19 other than the tree - level term @xmath57 , the potential minimum of eq.([vd - ks ] ) can correspond to the point @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> however , that implies vanishing fi term and that is not good , because we can not realize the @xmath0-term inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we need another contribution to lead to a suppressed , but non - vanishing value of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> hence we will consider models with nonperturbative corrections and study the dilaton stabilization in order to lead to a suppressed , but non - vanishing fi term .    </S>",
    "<S> the khler potential must also have the perturbative correction @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect @xcite @xmath60 with @xmath61 , because of @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case with @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is expected that the perturbative correction would be irrelevant . for the moment , we neglect @xmath59 , but we will consider its effects after examining explicit models .    </S>",
    "<S> nonperturbative effects in the khler potential are still unknown . following refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we use the following ansatz for the nonperturbative term , @xmath64 where @xmath65 . we also include the over - all moduli field @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the total khler potential is written as @xmath67 where the fourth term in the right hand side is the khler potential of @xmath32 . only with this khler potential , the scalar potential during inflation </S>",
    "<S> is written as @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> its minimum corresponds to @xmath69 other than the runaway vacuum , that is , we can not obtain a finite vacuum energy deriving the inflation . </S>",
    "<S> hence , another contribution is necessary to realize the dilaton stabilization leading to a suppressed , but finite value of @xmath18 .    as a such contribution , here we assume a nonperturbative superpotential . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two types of nonperturbative superpotentials . </S>",
    "<S> one is written as @xmath70 here the first term is due to the gaugino condensation with the 1-loop beta - function coefficient @xmath71 , and the second term is due to the non - vanishing flux . </S>",
    "<S> the second type of superpotential is written as @xmath72 this superpotential is generated by double gaugino condensations with 1-loop beta - function coefficients @xmath73 , that is , the so - called racetrack type @xcite . for simplicity , we have assumed that either @xmath74 or @xmath75 does not include @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the total scalar potential during inflation is written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 .    in order to realize the @xmath0-term inflation </S>",
    "<S> , we have to stabilize @xmath9 such that @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath24 does not include @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if @xmath9 is stabilized satisfying @xmath78 , the potential for the moduli @xmath66 would be insignificant and its dynamics also could be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we are interested in the model leading to a suppressed value of @xmath24 compared with @xmath79 , which is the vacuum energy in the model only with the tree - level khler potential . </S>",
    "<S> concerned about a stabilized value of @xmath80 , we are interested in models with @xmath81 , but we do not restrict ourselves to some specific values , e.g. @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the stabilization we are discussing happens in the false vacuum , and in the true vacuum the dilaton potential and its stabilized value would be different from those of false vacuum .    here </S>",
    "<S> we show examples of the dilaton stabilization with @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the density perturbation generated by the inflaton is same as that in a simple model by the condition , @xmath78 . for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath83 in the following analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the case using the superpotential @xmath74 with the parameters , @xmath84,@xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the almost flat light line corresponds to @xmath24 , and the dotted one corresponds to @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the bold one corresponds to the total potential @xmath91 . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the dilaton is stabilized at @xmath92 , where we have @xmath78 . around this minimum </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath90 is very steep , while @xmath24 is very flat . </S>",
    "<S> such situation plays a role in realizing @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the total potential value is obtained as @xmath93 , and that is comparable to @xmath94 , which is the potential value derived only by the tree - level khler potential @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , the non - perturbative khler potential does not contribute to suppress the fi term .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.7    in order to obtain more suppressed fi term , we take another different parameters . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the case using @xmath74 with the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the dilaton is stabilized at @xmath96 , where we have @xmath78 . at this minimum , </S>",
    "<S> the total potential is obtained as @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> now the potential value @xmath97 is suppressed compared with @xmath94 . in this case , the nonperturbative khler potential plays a role in suppressing the fi term . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the non - perturbative khler potential is useful to lead to a suppressed fi term when we take proper parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the value of minimum potential depends linearly on @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> when we take more suppressed value of @xmath98 , we obtain much smaller potential value .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.7    similarly , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 shows the case using the superpotential @xmath75 with the parameters , @xmath99,@xmath85 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the dilaton is stabilized as @xmath105 , where we have @xmath78 . at this minimum </S>",
    "<S> , the total potential is obtained as @xmath106 , which is very suppressed compared with @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the form of potential is steeper .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.7    in the literature , another form of nonperturbative khler potential has been used like @xmath107 for this type , we can study similarly . </S>",
    "<S> for example , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 shows the case using this khler potential and the superpotential @xmath74 with the parameters , @xmath108 , @xmath85 , @xmath109 , @xmath87 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> the dilaton is stabilized at @xmath112 , where we have @xmath78 . at this minimum , </S>",
    "<S> the total potential @xmath113 is very much suppressed compared with @xmath94 . therefore , it is possible to stabilize the dilaton such that @xmath114 when we take suitable values of parameters . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the potential value @xmath91 depends linearly on @xmath98 , again . </S>",
    "<S> when we take smaller values of @xmath13 , we obtain more suppressed value of @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.7    we have neglected the perturbative khler term @xmath59 . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate its effects on our results . </S>",
    "<S> we replace @xmath115 as follows , @xmath116 in the above models . </S>",
    "<S> then we repeat the above potential analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the results , the stabilized values of @xmath117 and the potential values , are the same for @xmath118 in all of the above models except the model shown in fig .  3 . in the model of fig </S>",
    "<S> .  3 , the stabilized value of @xmath117 does not change , but the potential value changes , that is , the total potential value @xmath91 at the minimum is obtained as @xmath119 , e.g. for @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> this potential value @xmath119 is still suppressed compared with @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the nonperturbative khler potential contributes to suppress it . </S>",
    "<S> however , the perturbative term in the khler potential is important in this model . </S>",
    "<S> its reason is that the stabilized value @xmath117 is small , while the dilaton is stabilized at larger values in the other models . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we have to take into account effects due to the perturbative khler term , in particular the models with a small value of @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is a possibility that the perturbative khler term plays a role to lead to suppressed fi term by cancelling the contribution due to @xmath57 in models with little contribution due to @xmath121 . in such case </S>",
    "<S> , the stabilized value of @xmath117 would be quite small like @xmath122 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we give a brief comment on the cosmic string problem . </S>",
    "<S> after inflation , in the true vacuum the cosmic strings are generated ,- </S>",
    "<S> term inflation model without generating cosmic strings has been studied @xcite . ] and that leads to the density perturbation , which is inconsistent with the cmb observation for @xmath123 if the fi term @xmath22 in the true vacuum is obtained as @xmath124 gev . </S>",
    "<S> one way to avoid this problem is to take a suppressed value of @xmath125 like @xmath126 @xcite . in string theory , </S>",
    "<S> the coupling @xmath125 also depends on the dilaton and other moduli fields . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in orbifold models , it is obtained as @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is a constant factor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that implies that a large value of @xmath66 , e.g. @xmath129 , leads to a small value of @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> also depends on continuous wilson lines similarly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> large value of continues wilson lines lead to a suppressed value of @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> ] however , the inflaton must take a large expectation value of order @xmath130 in a model with such a extremely small @xmath125 . in this sence </S>",
    "<S> , this option might not be a excellent solution .    </S>",
    "<S> the second possibility is that the fi term @xmath22 is suppressed through the above mechanism both in the false vacuum during inflation and in the true vacuum like @xmath131 gev . in this case , the density fluctuation generated by cosmic strings is suppressed sufficiently . however , at the same time , the density fluctuation due to the inflaton is also suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> we need another source of the density fluctuation to be consistent with the cmb observation , e.g. the curvaton .    </S>",
    "<S> we have another possibility , that is , the dilaton is stabilized through the above mechanism leading to @xmath132 gev during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> after inflation , the superpotential can change e.g. the vev of @xmath133 in the true vacuum can make mass terms of hidden matter fields relevant to nonperturbative superpotential . in this case , the stabilized value of @xmath117 in the true vacuum would be different from one in the false vacuum during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the true vacuum can correspond to more suppressed values of @xmath18 and @xmath22 than those during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of such possibility in explicit models is beyond our scope . </S>",
    "<S> it will be studied elsewhere . here </S>",
    "<S> we would like to mention that the nonperturbative khler potential may solve not only the problem of the magnitude of the fi term but also the problem of cosmic string in d - term inflation .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the possibility for suppressing the fi term in the @xmath0-term inflation scenario . that is possible when we consider the nonperturbative khler potential of the dilaton field . that is an interesting possibility . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it would be important to study its implications in detail by investigating evolutions of dilaton and other moduli after inflation , a concrete model of gaugino condensation , and so on . </S>"
