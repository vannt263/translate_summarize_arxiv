    "the notion of a trapped surface was introduced by penrose @xcite . in @xmath0-dimensional spacetime the spacelike boundary , @xmath1 , of a @xmath2-dimensional spatial region is called a future trapped surface if gravity is so strong there that even the future and ` outwards ' directed normal null rays starting at @xmath1 are dragged back so much that their expansion is non - positive everywhere on @xmath1 .",
    "careful analysis justified that trapped surfaces necessarily occur whenever sufficient amount of energy is concentrated in a small spacetime region @xcite .",
    "intuitively a black hole region is considered to be a part of a spacetime from which nothing can escape .",
    "therefore a black hole region is supposed to be a future set comprised by events that individually belong to some future trapped surface .",
    "the boundary of such a black hole region , referred to usually as the `` apparent horizon '' , @xmath3 , is then supposed to be comprised by marginal future trapped surfaces . as one of the most important recent results in black hole physics",
    "the existence of an `` apparent horizon '' was proved in @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it was shown there that given a strictly stable _ marginally outer trapped surface _ ( mots ) @xmath4 in a spacetime with reference foliation @xmath5 , then , there exists an open _ tube _ , @xmath6 , foliated by marginally outer trapped surfaces , with @xmath7 , through @xmath8 .",
    "let us merely mention , without getting into details here , that the applied strict stability assumption is to exclude the appearance of future trapped surfaces in the complementer of a black hole region .    hawking s black hole topology theorem @xcite is proven by demonstrating that whenever the dominant energy condition ( _ dec _ ) holds a mots @xmath1 can be deformed , along the family of null geodesics transverse to the apparent horizon , yielding thereby  on contrary to the fact that @xmath1 is a mots  a future trapped surface in the complementer of the black hole region , unless the euler characteristic @xmath9 of @xmath1 is positive .",
    "whenever @xmath1 is a codimension two surface in a @xmath0-dimensional spacetime the euler characteristic and the `` genus '' , @xmath10 , of @xmath1 can be given , in virtue of the gauss - bonnet theorem , via the integral of the scalar curvature @xmath11 of the metric @xmath12 induced on @xmath1 as @xmath13    the main difficulty in generalising hawking s argument to the higher dimensional case originates from the fact that whenever @xmath1 is of dimension @xmath14 in an @xmath15-dimensional spacetime , the integral of the scalar curvature @xmath16 by itself is not informative , as opposed to the case of @xmath17 , therefore the notion of euler characteristic has to be replaced by the yamabe invariant .",
    "the latter is known to be a fundamental topological invariant and it is defined as follows .",
    "denote by @xmath18 $ ] the conformal class of riemannian metrics on @xmath1 determined by @xmath12 .",
    "it was conjectured by yamabe , and later proved by trudinger , aubin , and schoen that to every conformal class on any smooth compact manifold there exists a metric @xmath19 of constant scalar curvature so that @xmath20)\\cdot \\left(\\int_{\\mathscr{s}}\\eeepsilon_{\\tilde    q}\\right)^{-\\frac{2}{s-2}}\\,,\\ ] ] where the yamabe constant @xmath21)$ ] , associated with the conformal class @xmath18 $ ] , is defined as @xmath22)= \\inf_{\\hat q\\in[q]}\\frac{\\int_{\\mathscr{s}}r_{\\hat      q}\\,\\eeepsilon_{\\hat q } }   { \\left(\\int_{\\mathscr{s}}\\eeepsilon_{\\hat q}\\right)^{\\,\\,\\frac{s-2}{s } } } = \\inf_{u\\in c^{\\infty}(\\mathscr{s}),u>0}\\frac{\\int_{\\mathscr{s}}\\left [   4\\frac{s-1}{s-2}(d^au)(d_au)+r_qu^2 \\right]\\,\\eeepsilon_{q } }   { \\left(\\int_{\\mathscr{s}}u^{\\frac{2s}{s-2}}\\eeepsilon_{q}\\right)^{\\,\\,\\frac{s-2}{s } } } \\,.\\ ] ] in the later case , the metric @xmath23 $ ] can be given as @xmath24 , and , moreover , @xmath25 and @xmath11 denote the covariant derivative operator and the scalar curvature associated with the metric @xmath12 on @xmath1 .",
    "the yamabe invariant is defined then as @xmath26}y(\\mathscr{s},[q]).\\ ] ]    some of the recent generalisation of hawking s @xcite black hole topology theorem , and also that of gibbons @xcite and woolgar s @xcite results , proved by galloway , schoen , omurchadha and cai , that are covered by refs.@xcite may be formulated",
    "then as .    [ gs ] let @xmath27 be a spacetime of dimension @xmath28 satisfying the einstein equations @xmath29 with cosmological constant @xmath30 , and with matter subject to _ dec_. suppose , furthermore , that @xmath1 is a strictly stable mots in a regular spacelike hypersurface @xmath31 .    * if @xmath32 then @xmath1 is of positive yamabe type , i.e. , @xmath33 . * if @xmath34 and @xmath35 then for the `` area '' @xmath36 of @xmath1 the inequality @xmath37 holds .    the significance of these results get to be transparent if one recalls that in the first case , i.e. , when @xmath33 , @xmath1 can not carry a metric of non - positive sectional curvature which immediately restricts the topological properties of @xmath1 @xcite . whereas , in the second case the a lower bound on the `` entropy '' of a black hole , that is considered to be proportional to the area @xmath38 , is provided by ( [ gib ] ) .    before proceeding we would like to stress on an important conceptual point .",
    "most of the quoted investigations of black holes , see refs.@xcite , starts by assuming the existence of a reference foliation @xmath5 of the spacetime by ( partial ) cauchy surfaces @xmath39 . in this respect",
    "it is worth recalling that by a non - optimal choice of @xmath5 one might completely miss a black hole region as it follows from the results of @xcite where it was demonstrated that even in the extended schwarzschild spacetime one may find a sequence of cauchy surfaces which get arbitrarily close to the singularity such that neither of these cauchy surfaces contains a future trapped surface .",
    "hence , one of the motivations for the present work  besides providing a reduction of the complexity of the proof of theorem[gs ] , and also a simultaneous widening of its range of applicability  was to carry out a discussion without making use of any reference foliation .",
    "as it will be seen below the simplicity of the presented argument allows the investigation of black holes essentially in arbitrary metric theory of gravity .",
    "thereby , we do not restrict our considerations to either of the specific theories .",
    "accordingly , a spacetime is assumed to be represented by a pair @xmath27 , where @xmath40 is an @xmath15-dimensional ( @xmath41 ) , smooth , paracompact , connected , orientable manifold endowed with a smooth lorentzian metric @xmath42 of signature @xmath43 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath27 is time orientable and that a time orientation has been chosen .",
    "the only restriction , concerning the geometry of the allowed spacetimes , is the following generalised version of _",
    "dec_. a spacetime @xmath27 is said to satisfy the _ generalised dominant energy condition _ if there exists some smooth real function @xmath44 on @xmath40 such that for all future directed timelike vector @xmath45 the combination @xmath46 $ ] is a future directed timelike or null vector , where @xmath47 denotes the einstein tensor @xmath48 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that in einstein s theory of gravity , where @xmath42 is subject to ( [ ein ] ) , the generalised dominant energy condition , with the choice @xmath49 , is equivalent to requiring the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath50 , to satisfy _ dec _ @xcite .    to restrict our considerations to black hole spacetimes",
    ", we shall also assume the existence of future trapped surfaces in @xmath27 which are defined as follows .",
    "let us consider a smooth orientable @xmath51-dimensional compact manifold @xmath1 with no boundary in @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath53 be smooth future directed null vector fields on @xmath1 scaled such that @xmath54 , and that are also normal to @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 for any vector field @xmath57 tangent to @xmath1 .",
    "consider then the null hypersurfaces generated by geodesics starting on @xmath1 with tangent @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "these null hypersurfaces are smooth in a neighbourhood of @xmath1 , and , by making use of the associated synchronised affine parametrisations of their null generators , the vector fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be , respectively , extended to them .",
    "the level surfaces of the corresponding synchronised affine parametrisations do also provide foliations of these null hypersurfaces by @xmath51-dimensional compact manifolds homologous to @xmath1 .",
    "denote by @xmath58 the volume element associated with the metric , @xmath12 , induced on these @xmath51-dimensional surfaces .",
    "then the null expansions @xmath59 and @xmath60 with respect to @xmath52 and @xmath53 are defined by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denotes the lie derivative with respect to the null vector fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    the @xmath51-dimensional surface @xmath1 is called future _ trapped surface _ if both of the null expansions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are non - positive on @xmath1 . in the limiting case ,",
    "i.e. , whenever either of these null expansions ( say @xmath59 ) vanishes on @xmath1 identically , @xmath1 is called future _ marginally trapped surface_.    in case of a generic @xmath51-dimensional surface the quasi - local concept of outwards and inwards directions is undetermined .",
    "nevertheless , these concepts get to be well - defined for non - minimal marginally trapped surfaces .",
    "it will be said that @xmath52 and @xmath53 point _ outwards _ and _ inwards _ , respectively , provided that @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and that @xmath60 is not identically zero .",
    "( if both @xmath59 and @xmath60 vanish identically @xmath1 is a minimal surface and the notions outwards and inwards become to be degenerate . )    to see that this , quasi - local , concept of `` outer '' direction is not counter intuitive , consider the null hypersurface @xmath66 generated by null geodesics starting at the points of @xmath1 with tangent @xmath67 ( see fig.[mots ] ) .    since @xmath66 is smooth in a neighbourhood @xmath68 of @xmath1 it can be smoothly foliated by @xmath51-dimensional surfaces , @xmath69 , defined as the @xmath70 cross - sections of @xmath66 , where @xmath71 is the affine parameter along the generators of @xmath66 such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 on @xmath1 . then",
    ", it seems to be natural to consider @xmath53 as inward pointing if the `` area '' @xmath74 of the cross - sections @xmath69 is non - decreasing in the direction of @xmath75 which , in the case under consideration , follows from @xmath65 as @xmath76    accordingly , @xmath1 is called future _ marginally outer trapped surface _ ( mots ) if @xmath64 and @xmath65 on @xmath1 .",
    "in deriving our results we shall also apply a stability assumption . before formulating it",
    "let us recall first that the above imposed conditions do not uniquely determine the pair of null vector fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 on @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , together with @xmath52 and @xmath53 any pair of null vector fields @xmath77 and @xmath78 that is yielded by the boost transformation @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an arbitrary smooth function on @xmath1 , will be suitable .",
    "it is well - known , however , that the signs of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are invariant under such positive rescaling of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "suppose then that @xmath1 is a future mots with respect to a null normal @xmath52 .",
    "then , @xmath1 will be called _ strictly stably outermost _ if there exists a rescaling of the type ( [ boost ] ) so that @xmath81 for the yielded vector fields @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and also @xmath82 somewhere on @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , this definition is independent of the use of any sort of reference foliation .",
    "moreover , as it will be indicated below , it can be seen to be equivalent to the corresponding criteria applied in @xcite .",
    "the main argument of the present paper can then be given in the following simple geometric setup .",
    "we have already defined @xmath67 to be a smooth past directed null vector field on @xmath1 that is also normal to @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , the smooth null hypersurface @xmath66 , spanned by the @xmath51-parameter congruence of null geodesics starting at @xmath1 with tangent @xmath75 , and the affine parameter @xmath71 along the geodesics , synchronised such that @xmath73 on @xmath1 , have already been introduced .",
    "denote by @xmath75 the tangent field @xmath83 on the null hypersurface @xmath66 , that is foliated by the smooth @xmath70 cross - sections , @xmath69 .",
    "then , there exists a uniquely defined future directed null vector field @xmath52 on @xmath66 such that @xmath84 , and that @xmath52 is orthogonal to each @xmath69 .",
    "denote by @xmath85 the affine parameter of the null geodesics determined by @xmath52 which are synchronised such that @xmath86 on @xmath66 .",
    "since @xmath52 is , by construction , smooth on @xmath66 the null geodesics starting with tangent @xmath52 on @xmath66 do not meet within a sufficiently small open `` elementary spacetime neighbourhood '' @xmath68 of @xmath1 .",
    "extend , then , the function @xmath71 from @xmath66 onto @xmath68 by keeping its value to be constant along the geodesics with tangent @xmath52 .",
    "then the vector fields @xmath75 and @xmath52 , defined so far only on @xmath66 , do also extend onto @xmath68 such that the relations @xmath72 and @xmath87 hold there which do also imply that @xmath75 and @xmath52 commute on @xmath68 . note that @xmath68 is smoothly foliated by the @xmath88-parameter family of @xmath51-dimensional @xmath70 , @xmath89 level surfaces @xmath90 .",
    "the spacetime metric in @xmath68 can then always be given ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a justification ) as @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are smooth fields on @xmath68 such that @xmath93 and @xmath94 are orthogonal to @xmath75 and @xmath52 .",
    "recall also that @xmath94 and the positive definite metric @xmath12 on the @xmath51-dimensional surfaces @xmath90 are related as @xmath95 this latter relation implies that @xmath96 on @xmath66 , represented by the @xmath86 hypersurface in @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath94 is the metric on the cross - sections @xmath97 of @xmath66 .    since the vector fields @xmath75 and @xmath52 are null and normal to the cross - sections @xmath97 the expansions of the associated null congruences at @xmath97 can be given as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath62 denote the lie derivative with respect to the vector fields @xmath75 and @xmath52 , respectively , and ( here and elsewhere ) all the indices are raised and lowered with the spacetime metric @xmath42 .",
    "the second equalities in ( [ exp ] ) follow from the fact that @xmath93 and @xmath94 are orthogonal to @xmath75 and @xmath52 and also that @xmath75 and @xmath52 commute in @xmath68 .    by making use of ( [ metric ] ) , and the definition of the einstein tensor , it is straightforward to see that @xmath100= -\\frac12 \\gamma^{ef}r_{ef}\\ ] ] holds on @xmath66 .",
    "then , in virtue of equation @xmath101 of @xcite , and by the coincidence of @xmath12 and @xmath94 , and also of the projectors @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 on @xmath66 ( for the definition of @xmath104 see @xmath105 of @xcite ) we also have that on @xmath66 @xmath106\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath11 denote the covariant derivative operator and the scalar curvature associated with the metric @xmath96 on the @xmath51-dimensional surfaces @xmath97 on @xmath66 . by making use of the fact that the vector fields @xmath75 and @xmath52 commute in @xmath68 and that they are orthogonal to @xmath94 a direct calculation justifies then the relation @xmath107    since @xmath75 and @xmath52 commute we also have that @xmath108 in @xmath68 , where the expansion @xmath109 is defined with respect to the volume element @xmath110 associated with the metric @xmath12 on the surfaces @xmath90 as in ( [ exp ] ) . similarly , it can be verified that @xmath111 on @xmath66 , i.e. , whenever @xmath86 , where @xmath53 denotes the unique future directed null extension @xmath112\\ ] ] of @xmath113 on @xmath1 onto @xmath68 which is normal to the surfaces @xmath90 and is scaled such that @xmath54 in @xmath68 .",

    "this justifies then that the strict stability conditions applied here and in @xcite ( see , e.g. , definition 5.1 and the discussion at the end of section 5 of @xcite for more details ) are equivalent .    in returning to the main stream of our argument note that whenever @xmath1 is a strictly stable mots and the generalised _",
    "dec _ holds then , in virtue of ( [ gdec2 ] ) , @xmath128 so that the inequality is strict somewhere on @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath12 is positive definite we also have that for any smooth function @xmath71 on @xmath1 @xmath129 thus , multiplying ( [ gdec3 ] ) by @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is arbitrary , we get , in virtue of ( [ gdec4 ] ) , that @xmath132 so that the inequality is strict somewhere on @xmath1 .    to get the analogue of the first part of theorem[gs ]",
