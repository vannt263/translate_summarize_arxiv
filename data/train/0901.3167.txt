    "several of the different current approaches to algebraic geometry over the  field with one element \" are based on identifying a class of additional data to be imposed over a ring , or a scheme over @xmath2 , for it to be defined over the  underlying \" @xmath1 . among these approaches ,",
    "the one developed by soul @xcite is based on finiteness and universality conditions on the structure of cyclotomic points , whereas another approach recently developed by borger @xcite is based on the structure of @xmath0-ring as a descent condition from @xmath2 to @xmath1 . in the recent work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that , in the soul approach to @xmath1-geometry , the tower of extensions @xmath3 with their galois action are nicely encoded by a noncommutative space , the bost  connes ( bc ) endomotive .",
    "endomotives are a class of noncommutative spaces introduced in @xcite based on projective limits of artin motives with semigroup actions , and morphisms given by correspondences .",
    "the bc algebra of @xcite is a natural example in this class .    in this paper",
    "we show that the bc endomotive , and some direct generalizations , are also natural objects from the point of view of borger s approach to geometry over @xmath1 , since the endomorphism action that defines the structure of endomotive is also a consistent lift of frobenius morphisms in the sense of @xmath0-rings .    the results obtained in this paper fall under the common theme of comparing different models of noncommutative algebras associated to the cyclotomic tower with the action of the positive integers by endomorphisms .",
    "as argued in @xcite , @xcite , and  3 of @xcite , the bost  connes algebra can be regarded as the noncommutative ring of functions of a noncommutative space naturally associated to the zero - dimensional shimura variety ( the cyclotomic tower ) , when one considers on it the action of the semigroup of positive integers by endomorphisms .",
    "the latter corresponds to imposing the equivalence relation of commensurability on 1-dimensional @xmath4-lattices up to scaling , in the formulation given in @xcite .",
    "here we also consider another noncommutative algebra of functions associated to the same geometric object , which instead of using the group algebra of @xmath5 , or equivalently the algebra of continuous functions on @xmath6 , to describe functions on roots of unity , is based on the habiro ring of `` analytic functions of roots of unity '' and on the same family of endomorphisms .",
    "both the habiro ring and the abelian part of the bost - connes algebra describe different aspects of the same underlying geometry and this serves as a very useful guideline to obtain various results on generalizations of the bc endomotive . for instance",
    ", the multivariable generalizations of the habiro ring constructed by manin in @xcite also give rise to a family of noncommutative algebras related to actions of endomorphisms of higher dimensional algebraic tori .",
    "the resulting noncommutative spaces also admit a description in terms of endomotives in the sense of @xcite and this leads to the construction of multivariable bc endomotives .",
    "we show that these multivariable bc algebras are closely related to the theory of @xmath0-rings , in the formulation given in @xcite , as another approach to the theory of geometry over the `` field with one element '' .",
    "we show that the ( multivariable ) bc endomotives are universal ( torsion free ) @xmath0-rings , in the sense that any such @xmath0-ring that is of finite rank over @xmath2 and has no nilpotents can be embedded in a product of bc endomotives , compatibly with the frobenius action .    in order to construct quantum statistical mechanical systems for the multivariable bc endomotives",
    ", one needs to correct for the fact that the natural time evolution that generalizes the one - variable case has infinite multiplicities in the spectrum of the hamiltonian coming from the presence of an @xmath7-symmetry .",
    "the problem is completely analogous to the one encountered in @xcite in the case of 2-dimensional @xmath4-lattices , and one can use essentially the same method used in @xcite to circumvent the problem by using the trace of a type ii@xmath8 factor associated to the @xmath7-action . we show that multiple zeta values of cones define classes of states on the multivariable bc algebras .",
    "the habiro ring of functions was originally introduced ( see @xcite and @xcite ) as the natural receptacle for a universal invariant of integral homology 3-spheres that specializes to the witten  reshetikhin ",
    "turaev invariant @xmath9 at each root of unity @xmath10 and whose taylor expansion at @xmath11 gives the ohtsuki series @xmath12 . in view of the relation between the habiro ring and the noncommutative geometry of the cyclotomic tower , it is then natural to try to relate the universal witten ",
    "turaev invariant itself to quantum statistical mechanics and noncommutative geometry , on one side , and to the geometry of gadgets over the `` field with one element '' in the sense of @xcite , on the other .",
    "we concentrate on these questions in the last part of the paper , where we consider the question of constructing convolution algebras associated to surgery presentations of 3-manifolds with actions of @xmath13 by endomorphisms , and of possible relations to endomotives via the wrt invariants",

    "as argued in @xcite , @xcite , the bc algebra is ( up to morita equivalence ) the algebra of functions on the noncommutative zero - dimensional shimura variety @xmath36 , whose set of classical points is the usual zero - dimensional shimura variety @xmath37 associated to the cyclotomic tower .",
    "this classical space is recovered from the noncommutative space as the set of low temperature extremal kms states of the bc quantum statistical mechanical system .",
    "the action of @xmath38 on the finite adeles @xmath39 corresponds to a partially defined action on @xmath6 , which in turn corresponds to the semigroup action .",
    "this point of view based on towers and shimura varieties was generalized to 2-dimensions in @xcite and @xcite , @xcite , and to more general shimura varieties in @xcite .",
    "the quantum statistical mechanical procedure of associating to a noncommutative space with a natural time evolution a classical space given by the set of low temperature extremal kms states was formulated in greater generality in @xcite in the context of a theory of _",
    "endomotives_. the latter are noncommutative spaces obtained from towers of artin motives and semigroups of endomorphisms .",
    "they carry a galois action and a time evolution to which quantum statistical mechanical techniques can be applied .",
    "the original case of the bc system is obtained in @xcite as a particular case of a general procedure that constructs endomotives from self maps of pointed algebraic varieties , via a projective system of artin motives obtained as inverse images of the fixed point under the given family of self - maps . in the case of the bc endomotive ,",
    "the variety is @xmath40 , the multiplicative group , and the self maps are the semigroup @xmath41 of morphisms @xmath42 on @xmath43 $ ] .",

    "it is useful to recall here more in detail the properties of the endomorphisms @xmath56 , @xmath53 , and the idempotents @xmath54 , because this will constitute an important difference between the model of the noncommutative geometry of the cylotomic tower based on the bc algebra and the one based on the habiro ring .",

    "we also recall one more property of the bc algebra , namely its hilbert space representations associated to embeddings in @xmath61 of the roots of unity , which we need in the following .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the choice of an element @xmath62 determines a representation @xmath63 of the bc algebra as bounded operators on the hilbert space @xmath64 with @xmath65 on the canonical basis @xmath66 of @xmath64 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the root of unity obtained using the chosen @xmath62 to embed the abstract roots of unity @xmath5 in @xmath61 .",
    "finally , we also recall the fact that an integer model for the bc algebra was constructed in @xcite , as the ring @xmath69 generated by elements @xmath23 , with @xmath26 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 , subject to the same relations , but with the relations replaced by the analogous relations @xmath72 the endomorphisms @xmath56 of are still defined on @xmath73 $ ] and they satisfy relations replacing and , in the form @xmath74.\\ ] ] the @xmath70 can be realized as bounded operators on @xmath64 acting by @xmath75 they no longer are adjoints to the @xmath71 but they satisfy @xmath76 .",

    "the @xmath79 are no longer ring homomorphisms , but only correspondences , so that @xmath80 is not a semigroup crossed product ring .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that the bost ",

    "we now recall the basic properties of the habiro ring of  analytic functions on roots of unity \" constructed in @xcite .",

    "a first question is the following : if @xmath331 and @xmath1198 in @xmath1167 represent the same link type , do the corresponding elements @xmath1208 and @xmath1209 also represent the same link type ?",
    "notice that a positive answer to this question would follow , if we knew that two equivalent @xmath331 and @xmath1198 will have the same length .",
    "this is certainly not the case if one is allowed to use markov de / stabilizations .",
    "however , it is a well known conjecture of jones ( see @xcite p.357 ) that the algebraic crossing number ( or writhe ) of a minimal braid ( with braid index @xmath257 equal to the minimum value for the given knot type ) is a link invariant , hence if @xmath331 and @xmath1198 in @xmath1167 are braid representatives with @xmath257 minimal , then @xmath1210 . evidence for this conjecture is given , for instance , in @xcite .    if we assume the jones conjecture that minimal braids have a unique writhe , then it is clear that , if @xmath331 and @xmath1198 are two such braid representatives of a given link type , then the transformed @xmath1211 and @xmath1212 also represent the same link type , where @xmath1213 is the writhe of both @xmath331 and @xmath1198 . in fact , both are obtained from equivalent braids by composing them with the same number @xmath1214 of full twists of the @xmath257 strands , which still yields equivalent braids .",
    "minimal complexity braid representatives are in particular minimal braids , so if we apply our transformation to these elements only and we assume the jones conjecture holds , we do get a positive answer to the question above , which in turn implies that the link type of the image is well defined regardless of which minimal complexity representative we choose among the finitely many available for a given link type .",
    "we can then ask the next question , which is needed in order to be able to iterate the transformation we defined by applying the braid group endomorphism @xmath754 to braids that are of minimal complexity in the sense of @xcite .      to understand the answer to this question one needs to understand how inserting full twists in a given minimal complexity braid diagram alters the properties of the seifert surface @xmath1101 and of the braid foliation determined on it by the fixed fibration @xmath446 . notice that neither the choice of the axis @xmath768 nor the number @xmath257 are changed by the operation above . however ,",
    "the fact that @xmath257 is unchanged does not a priori imply that it will still be minimal for the new link type .",
    "we do not at present know of an answer to question [ quescomplexity ] .",
    "thus , we can , for the sake of this discussion , define @xmath1216 to be the class of link types that admit a minimal complexity braid representative for which the answer to the question is positive .",
    "notice that the set @xmath1216 is non - empty .",
    "in fact , it contains at least the torus knots @xmath1217 , which have a unique minimal braid conjugacy class , which is determined by the braid @xmath1218 . on these minimal braids",
    "the action described above is of the form @xmath1219 which has the effect of transforming @xmath1217 into @xmath1220 .",
    "thus , modulo obtaining a better answer to question [ quescomplexity ] , we will be restricting our attention to the subring @xmath1216 of @xmath1221 .",
    "one can use the complexity arguments of @xcite to check that the ring multiplication , which is given by the disjoint union of links , is well defined on this subset .",
    "notice then that if we have two endomorphisms of the same type @xmath1222 they satisfy @xmath1223 thus , upon choosing an endomorphism @xmath1224 for each generator @xmath762 of the multiplicative semigroup @xmath13 one obtains an action of the abelian semigroup @xmath13 on the links of @xmath1216 .",
    "we are then left with the question of implementing the surgery equivalence of links .",
    "since we are working with closed braid representatives , it is best to think of the equivalence relation generated by the fenn ",
    "rourke moves ( let us restrict to the original case of integer framings for simplicity here ) in terms of braid groups .",
    "this was done in @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we give here the formulation of @xcite , which is closer to the form we need . in this form ,",
    "the set of surgery equivalence classes of @xmath257-strand braid representatives is the quotient of the braid group @xmath1167 by its normal subgroup @xmath1225 , which is the third term in the lower central series of the pure braid group @xmath1226 defined by the exact sequence @xmath1227 which maps the braid group to the symmetric group acting as permutations of the endpoints of the braid .",
    "this point of view has the advantage of formulating the equivalence relation in a way that is manifestly compatible with the braid group structure and compositions of braids .",
    "thus , in particular , if our transformation is given by the braid group endomorphism @xmath1228 , then if @xmath331 and @xmath1198 are surgery equivalent so that @xmath1229 , we have @xmath1230 . in particular , if @xmath331 and @xmath1198 are surgery equivalent and have @xmath1210 then @xmath1231 , so their images under @xmath1232 are also surgery equivalent .",
    "this only takes care of implementing surgery equivalence among representatives with the same number of strands and with the same writhe .",
    "since @xmath331 and @xmath1198 here belong to different link types , the jones conjecture for their minimal braid representatives need no longer imply that @xmath1210 even if they have the same @xmath257 .",
    "thus , this argument alone does not suffice to implement surgery equivalence . a more refined argument along these lines",
    "may be obtained , in the case of algebraically split links , in terms of the milnor invariants obtained from triple intersections of seifert surfaces as in @xcite .    a different way to approach",
    "the question of implementing the surgery moves is to proceed as in @xcite , where one works with multiplicative invariants of links and obtains from these invariants of 3-manifolds only after a suitable averaging over repeated cabling operations and a thermodynamical limit .",
    "we only make some preliminary observations on what questions one needs to address for this approach to be indeed compatible with the action on links defined using the braid group endomorphisms and the minimal complexity braid representatives .",
    "essentially , we are again asking a question similar to question [ quescomplexity ] above , on whether certain operations , in this case cabling , preserve the minimal complexity property .",
    "there are some indications to this effect , at least for what concerns the first entry of the complexity function of @xcite , that is , the braid index .",
    "in fact , it is shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the braid index of the @xmath106-cabling of a link @xmath743 is @xmath106-times the braid index of @xmath743 , so the @xmath106-cabling of a minimal braid for @xmath743 is a minimal braid for the @xmath106-cabling of @xmath743 .",
    "also , by @xcite , if the jones conjecture holds for @xmath743 , it also holds for its cabled versions .",
    "the question of whether this property of the braid index extends to the rest of the complexity function of @xcite depends on the seifert surface of the cabled link and its braid foliations .",
    "since this will locally look like @xmath106 copies of the original seifert surface and foliations , it seems likely that the rest of the complexity function should also behave well under the cabling operations , but this requires a more careful investigation . if one can indeed extend in this way the action from a link to all its @xmath106-cabled version",
    ", one can take the resulting action as being the one that induces the action on the 3-manifold invariants , when the latter are constructed according to the procedure of @xcite .",
    "one can also , in this approach based on braid representatives of links , introduce the same kind of categorical constructions discussed in the first part of this section , with categories of braid representatives , 1-morphisms given by surgery equivalences and and 2-morphisms by markov de / stabilizations and conjugations . for a categorical framework using",
    "braid representatives of links see for instance @xcite .    at this stage",
    "it is not clear how far one can develop this point of view",
    ". it would be interesting to interpret the universal wrt invariant as a morphism from a suitable  endomotive of homology 3-spheres \" , which means a crossed product @xmath1233 by an action of @xmath13 on an algebra @xmath1234 of admissible links and hoste moves implementing the surgery equivalence between them , to the endomotive constructed out of the one - variable habiro ring earlier in this paper .",
    "such a construction would make it possible to import the techniques of noncommutative geometry developed in @xcite for the theory of endomotives to the context of 3-manifold invariants ."
