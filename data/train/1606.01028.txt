    "define now , for any @xmath25 , @xmath35 it is a vector in which each entry tells us , for any player , the total value that she derives from the given allocation @xmath36 .    we are going to search for an allocation @xmath37 which simultaneously satisfies    ( strong ) pareto optimality ( po ) : :    there is no other allocation @xmath38    such that [    @xmath39    with strict inequality for at least one player .",

    "we are now going to review two geometric structures that are useful for the analysis of po and po - eq allocations .",
    "first of all we characterize the po allocations .",
    "( theorem 1 , @xcite , proposition 4.3 @xcite ) under mac , an allocation is po iff , for some @xmath43 the following holds : @xmath44 we denote with @xmath45 any allocation satisfying      we consider the individual pieces set @xmath46 ( see @xcite ) , also known as partition range , defined as follows @xmath47    [ chullp ] @xmath48 .",

    "the argument can be replicated to other goods to conclude that holds . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume @xmath61 an consider two other allocations .",

    "mac implies that no pareto face is parallel to any of the coordinate axes .",
    "if we consider the partition range from above , finding the po - eq allocation amounts to finding the face of the pb that contains the egalitarian ray ( actually more than one face may be involved if the egalitarian ray `` hits '' an edge , or coincides with an integer allocation ) , and then find the allocation of the pareto face which yields the optimal value ( figure [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "consider , for any @xmath69 , the normalizing operator @xmath70 and define the normalized pareto boundary , thereon npb , as a @xmath71 simplex such that @xmath72 then , the pareto faces partition the set npb , and finding the po - eq allocation amounts to finding the allocation corresponding to the center @xmath73 on npb ( figure [ fig1](b ) ) .        to find the po - eq allocations we will employ the following result valid for general fair division problems ( any number of players , completely divisible and non - homogeneous goods ) .

    "an algorithm that returns the leximin allocation is described .",

    "figure [ fig1](b ) shows that the pb can be represented as a 2-dimensional simplex .",
    "we will now consider another 2-dimensional simplex , due to weller @xcite and extensively investigated by barbanel @xcite , that enables us to represent the items , the efficient partitions and the faces of pb into a single geometric figure .",

    ", we derive the following * pareto allocation rule * after @xmath90 , thereon @xmath92 , which delivers one or more po allocations under mac ( see theorem 10.9 in @xcite ) .",

    "the objects in each neighborhood are assigned to the player associated to the vertex .",
    "denote as @xmath93 any such allocation . in case",
    "the allocation is integer we will use @xmath94 .",
    "it is important to notice that the allocation rule may not be unique : in case an object lies on one of the disputing segments of @xmath90 , it can be considered on both sides of the segment , and therefore it can be assigned to any of the corresponding players , or it can be split between the interested players .",
    "every pareto allocation lies on the upper border of the convex set @xmath49 , and a hyperplane supports @xmath49 at this point . a more precise account of the relationship between supporting hyperplanes and the pareto allocation rule is given by the following result .",
    "( theorem 2 in @xcite ) assume mac .",
    "if , for any @xmath95 , we denote @xmath96 then , for any @xmath97 , the allocation @xmath76 satisfies @xmath92 with @xmath98 .",
    "conversely , for any @xmath99 , the allocation rule @xmath94 supports @xmath100 through the hyperplane @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "when , given @xmath99 , one or more objects lie on disputing segments , the associated hyperplane supports all the integer allocations and their convex hulls .",
    "this fact plays a crucial role in how the pareto faces are generated ; a detailed explanation will be provided in proof of theorem [ facesth ] .    for any item @xmath103",
    "we denote the segments joining @xmath104 to each of the three vertices the _ supporting segments_. two items , @xmath105 are _ support independent _ , or s - independent , if none of @xmath104 and @xmath106 lie on the supporting segments of the other item .    in figure [ fig - a ] we illustrate dividing and supporting segments of one or more items .",
    "the supporting segments of two items intersect exactly once if and only if the two items are s - independent .",
    "suppose two items , @xmath107 are @xmath108-independent",
    ". then @xmath109 lies in the interior of one of the triangles that the supporting lines of @xmath110 form in the rns , and does not lie on any of the disputing lines of the same item .",
    "the supporting line of @xmath109 with the vertex on the other side of the triangle , will intersect a supporting line of @xmath110 once , and this is the only possible intersection .",
    "conversely , if two items are @xmath108-dependent , a supporting line of one of them will be a subsegment of the supporting line of the other , yielding an infinite number of intersections .",

    "a face is formed when goods are located on the disputing segments of a hyperplane in a way that three or more different goods allocations generate unaligned points on the pareto surface of the partition range . moreover , according to lemma [ edgeslemma ] , when several goods lie on a disputing segment ( given a fixed common pareto rule for the remaining goods ) an edge on the pareto surface is produced and it is equivalent to the one that we obtain replacing all those disputed goods with a single one by summing up utilities for each player .    based on these simple remarks , we notice that different faces are formed depending on whether ( a ) the hyperplane coincides with a good in @xmath166 and ( b ) other items lie on one , two or all the disputing segments originated by the same hyperplane",

    "this corresponds to a slight tilt of the supporting hyperplane on the pareto surface , so that the single edge becomes the only supporting region for the hyperplane .",
    "we obtain edges that are connected to each other and form a cycle . moreover , every time we consider the hyperplane moving in opposite directions in the rns diagram ( actually all cases but * ( f1 ) * ) we consider goods that are contested between players with constant utility ratio",
    ". this yields parallel edges of the faces .",
    "we distinguish between two cases :    * in cases * ( f2 ) * and * ( f3 ) * , when moving the hyperplane in opposite directions , the contested good remains the same .",
    "in such cases the opposite sides are not only parallel , but also of equal length . case * ( f2 ) * corresponds to the situation in which any @xmath167 lying at the intersection of the supporting segments of two s - independent items @xmath168 with @xmath159 , and no other goods in that intersection .",
    "looking at the geometrical representation in the simplex , we are able to identify four directions ( shown by black arrows and labeled by a , b , c and d ) that correspond to a slight tilt of the supporting hyperplane on the pareto surface , so that the single edge becomes the only supporting region for the hyperplane .",
    "they are opposite two by two ; namely , a is opposite to b and c is opposite to d. moving towards a ( see figure [ subfig-2:f2 ] ) , the initial allocation changes as follow : item 1 ( in blue ) ends to be disputed and is assigned to player iii ; item 2 ( in red ) is still disputed between players i and ii .",
