    "binarity is relatively common among brown dwarfs ( bds ) and recent work on these objects has shown that their properties differ from those of stellar binaries on many levels ( see the review by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "their binarity fraction ( 10 - 30% ) is lower than for solar - type stars ( @xmath5 , @xcite ) and follows the overall trend of decreasing binarity fraction with decreasing mass .",
    "field brown dwarf binary systems are tighter than their more massive cousins , with few known systems with separations beyond 20au ( @xmath62.3% of m7-l8 dwarfs have wide , 40 to 1000 au , companions ; @xcite ) .",
    "their mass ratios are also closer to unity ( 77% of systems have a mass ratio @xmath7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these different properties contain valuable information regarding their mechanism of formation .",
    "the dearth of wide bd binaries might be a signature of relatively violent formation processes : accreting proto - stellar cores that are ejected from the cluster before reaching a stellar mass @xcite or photo - evaporation of pre - stellar cores by nearby massive stars @xcite .",
    "alternative processes have been proposed : gravitational collapse within a circumstellar disk @xcite and collapse of very low mass molecular cloud cores @xcite .",
    "observations of disks @xcite and outflows around young bds suggest that they undergo a t - tauri - like phase , which points to a star - like formation mechanism @xcite .",
    "each of these formation mechanisms leads to different bd binary frequency , separation distribution , and mass ratio distribution .    beyond the interest in constraining bd formation models ,",
    "binary bds are natural benchmark objects to test atmosphere and evolutionary models .",
    "their equal metallicity , coevality , and common distance put strong constraints when estimating these parameters from models by fitting both objects simultaneously @xcite .",
    "binaries that challenge evolutionary models have been found , most notably the 2mass j05352184 - 0546085 system discovered by @xcite that shows a temperature reversal ( the least massive object being the warmer one ) that has tentatively been explained by widely different magnetic activity in the two components @xcite .",
    "binary bds overlapping with the @xmath1-band brightening ( roughly late - l to mid - t ) are of particular interest as theoretical models can not easily reproduce the observed evolution of bds in this interval .",
    "the @xmath1-band brightening is partially explained by the presence of increased binarity at the l / t transition @xcite .",
    "this is particularly the case for objects with the strongest brightening .",
    "however , even taking into account confirmed and suspected binaries , a smaller , but still significant , brightening is observed .",
    "this is also confirmed by the existence of binaries with flux reversals @xcite .",
    "this brightening is probably best understood as resulting from the disappearance of dust - bearing clouds from the photosphere , but this temperature interval has proved challenging to describe with a self - consistent atmosphere model ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "binaries , especially those amenable to spatially resolved spectroscopy , provide unique constraints to these models .",
    "tighter binaries have orbital periods short enough for orbital monitoring and provide further constraints on models through dynamical masses @xcite .    in 2006 , we have undertaken a near - infrared proper motion survey ( _ sondage infrarouge de mouvement propre _ - simp ; @xcite ) with the wide - field near - infrared camera cpapir @xcite at the ctio 1.5 m and omm 1.6 m @xcite telescopes and have covered @xmath8 of the sky up to now .",
    "bd candidates were found using both the simp and 2mass database obtained at different epochs to identify high proper motion sources .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of high proper motion candidates has been done with gnirs @xcite , spex @xcite and niri @xcite in 2006 , 2007 and 2008 .",
    "more than 80 new l dwarfs and 14 new t dwarfs ( artigau et al .",
    ", in prep . ) were confirmed .",
    "we did not expect to detect any resolved binaries in our sample given that the binary bds separation distribution peaks at @xmath9au @xcite and that all of our observations were seeing - limited .",
    "we nevertheless searched systematically through our spectroscopy acquisition images and found two partially resolved binaries : a pair of mid - l dwarfs separated by @xmath10 ( simpj1501530 - 013506 , hereafter simp  j1501 - 0135 ) and a pair of mid - ts separated by @xmath11 ( simpj1619275 + 031350 , hereafter simp  j1619 + 0313 ) . following these discoveries",

    "finally , the spectral typing of all components is discussed in  [ typing ] and  [ discussion ] details the properties of both systems .",
    "following the discovery of the binary nature of simp  j1501 - 0135  and simp  j1619 +",
    "0313 we obtained a set of observations to characterize their resolved far - red and near - infrared ( 0.7 - 2.45@xmath14 m ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "these observations were aimed at putting both systems in the broader context of the existing sample of resolved bd binaries , as they both showed peculiarities worthy of further study . the large contrast ratio of simp  j1501 - 0135  ( @xmath15mag ) suggested a mid - l / mid - t binary , of which we know only a handful of examples .",
    "simp  j1619 + 0313 , with a @xmath16t3 blended spectral type , lies at the cooler end of the @xmath1-band brightening and was seen as likely to provide useful constraints to models attempting to reproduce this interval .",
    "the characterization was done through resolved optical and near - infrared photometry , resolved infrared spectroscopy , high - angular resolution imaging , and accurate near - infrared blended photometry .",
    "these observations resulted in detailed portraits of the individual components of both systems .",
    "a log of all observations is provided in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "all measurements available at hand , both from archives and from the observations presented here , as well as derived quantities , are compiled for simp  j1619 + 0313  and simp  j1501 - 0135  in tables  [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-2 ] respectively .",
    "when applicable , these measurements are given for the individual components of both systems .",
    "seeing limited spectroscopy was obtained at the gemini north telescope with niri for both binaries under excellent seeing conditions ( @xmath17 ) . for both binaries ,",
    "the slit was aligned with the binary axis to include both components in the slit .",
    "the 4-pixel ( 0.409 ) wide slit in the blue setup was used in combination with the f/6 @xmath1 , f/6 @xmath18 and f/6 @xmath19 grisms for a resolving power of 650 to 825 . for each grism setup ,",
    "a set of 10 120-s exposures was taken with a 5  nod along the slit between exposures .",
    "telluric correction was performed using a0-a1 star spectra ( hip 75230 and hip 79463 for simp  j1619 + 0313 and simp  j1501 - 0135 , respectively ) .",
    "spectroscopic flats were obtained as part of the standard calibrations with the gcal calibration unit .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed by registering bright telluric emission lines .",
    "the spectra were reduced by first pair subtracting two dithered spectral images .",
    "the resulting positive and negative traces showed the spectra of both components with little overlap .",
    "we extracted the individual spectra by using a linear inversion method where , for each spectral pixel , we represented the trace along the spatial direction by the sum of two 1-d gaussians of identical widths , with the same separation as the binary .",
    "this linear inversion correctly handles the overlapping spectra .",
    "once extracted , the final spectrum of each component was obtained by taking the median of all individual exposures and corrected for telluric absorption .",
    "the @xmath1 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 spectra were scaled by adjusting synthetic fluxes to the niri and cpapir photometry (  [ niri_photometry ] and  [ cpapir_photometry ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the resolved spectra of both components of both binaries compared to archival spectra of l4.5 , l5.5 , t3 and t4 dwarfs .",
    "in addition to the spectroscopic observations , we obtained resolved @xmath1 , @xmath18 , photometry with niri for both binaries under excellent seeing conditions ( 0.45 - 0.52 ) .",
    "in addition , these observations confirm the differential photometry obtained from ao observations (  [ lgs ] ) .",
    "resolved photometry is necessary to accurately reconstruct the near - infrared spectrum of each binary component as the niri spectra were obtained piecewise with separate @xmath1 , @xmath18 and @xmath19-grism setups .",
    "the images were reduced in a standard manner .",
    "a sky image was obtained by median combining all images obtained over 5 dither positions , then , all science images were sky subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "we obtained accurate flux ratios by performing simultaneous psf fitting on the two resolved components of the pairs for each individual science frame .",
    "the photometric accuracy was estimated from the standard deviation of the flux ratio measurements .",
    "we did not attempt to obtain absolute photometry measurements with this dataset as only a handful of field ( calibration ) stars are present in each @xmath20 niri field of view .",
    "we obtained far - red photometry for both binary systems to further constrain their physical properties , especially in view of their peculiar near - infrared photometry .",
    "the shape of the far - red ( @xmath12 to @xmath21 ) sed of l and t dwarfs is dominated by the pressure - broadened ki resonance doublet centered at @xmath22@xmath14 m @xcite .",
    "the sed in this wavelength interval varies with surface gravity , metallicity and the dust grain content of the atmosphere and is thus complementary to near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "a 200-s @xmath12-band snapshot of each target was obtained at cfht with megacam @xcite .",
    "simp  j1501 - 0135 was observed on 2006 july 20 with a seeing of @xmath23 while simp  j1619 + 0313  was observed on 2006 august 29 with a seeing of @xmath24 .",
    "simp  j1619 + 0313 was further observed in @xmath21 band on 2009 june 1 ; an exposure of 100s was used and the seeing was @xmath25 .",
    "the photometry is reported in the ab system and was calibrated using standard stars observed during the same observing run , without color - term corrections .",
    "the simp  j1619 + 0313ab components are marginally resolved in the megacam imagery ( i.e. separation of about one fwhm ) ; the flux measurements for both components listed in table[tbl-1 ] have been derived through psf fitting using a field star as a reference psf .",
    "the binary simp  j1501 - 0135  is unresolved in the @xmath12-band image .",
    "while the flux ratios of the components can be obtained through high resolution imaging , absolute photometry of the pairs needs calibration using numerous field stars .",
    "the unresolved 2mass photometry of both binaries only has a 7 - 9% precision in the three near - infrared band - passes , resulting in large ( i.e. @xmath26 ) color measurement errors , poorer by an order of magnitude than the component flux ratio measurements . to improve the blended photometry of the pairs",
    ", we obtained @xmath1 , @xmath18 and photometry at the observatoire du mont - mgantic ( omm ) using the cpapir @xcite wide - field imager on 2009 february 17 , 2009 march 3 , 2009 march 4 and 2009 march 9 .",
    "near - infrared colors of brown dwarfs can potentially vary by up to @xmath27mag depending on the photometric system used @xcite .",
    "this needs to be taken into account when comparing the photometric properties of our targets to these of other field brown dwarfs .",
    "the cpapir filters match those of the mauna kea ( mko ) system @xcite .",
    "the unresolved photometry measurements were performed through aperture photometry ( radius of one fwhm ) and are reported in tables  [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the zero points were set by using all 2mass stars in the point source catalog within an @xmath28 radius around the targets .",
    "we converted the 2mass magnitudes into the mauna kea system using the @xcite polynomial relations .",
    "the uncertainties on the zero points ( typically @xmath29 ) were determined from the dispersion of differences to the median divided by the square root of the number of calibration stars .    for comparison with bds in the literature , the mauna kea system magnitudes determined for both binaries were converted back into the 2mass system using the niri spectra and the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the corrections derived from this procedure match those given by the polynomial relations of @xcite to within 2% for the @xmath1 and @xmath18 bands .",
    "remarkably , the @xmath19-band correction differs by @xmath30 for both simp  j1501 - 0135 components as the @xmath19-band portion of their spectra peaks at a slightly bluer wavelength compared to field objects of similar spectral types ( see in particular simp  j1501 - 0135b in figure[fig3 ] ) .",
    "both objects are therefore brighter in the slightly bluer @xmath31 compared to @xmath32 .    the cpapir discovery ( 2006 ) and",
    "follow - up ( 2009 ) datasets were used to measure the proper motion of both pairs . the proper motion of field stars",
    "@xcite has been taken into account and , for both binaries , we corrected the proper motion measurement for the parallax estimated from the photometric distance .",
    "these corrections are smaller than 5 mas / yr in both spatial directions and smaller than the astrometric accuracy",
    ". tables  [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-2 ] report the measured proper motions .",
    "a search for common proper motion stars within a 30  radius was performed using the nltt @xcite catalog .",
    "no object was found to have a common pm with either binary .",
    "we note that nltt39039 lies 15.8  from simp  j1501 - 0135 and has a similar pm , but our analysis rules - out a common pm .",
    "the relatively wide physical separation of either binary ( exceeded only by the sdss1416 + 13ab system , @xcite ) leaves room for higher - order multiplicity for both systems . the case for a higher - order multiple",
    "is further strengthened for simp  j1501 - 0135  by its large flux ratio .",
    "furthermore , adaptive optics observations provide accurate differential photometry that can be combined with unresolved photometry for absolute flux measurements of individual components .",
    "both targets are too faint at visible wavelengths for natural guide star ao observations and neither has a bright enough nearby star for that purpose .",
    "however , they do both have nearby guide stars that are sufficiently bright to enable lgs ao operation .",
    "we obtained @xmath1 , @xmath18 and imaging of simp  j1501 - 0135 at the gemini north telescope using the niri imager in its f/32 configuration with the altair ao system operated in lgs mode .",
    "altair was used with its field lens that significantly reduces the anisoplanatism effects . the tip - tilt star (",
    "usno - b1.0  0884 - 0256280 , @xmath33 ; @xcite ) was located 37  from our target , at the workable limit of the system .",
    "we therefore had to offset simp  j1501 - 0135 from the center of the field .",
    "the images were reduced in a standard manner : a sky image was constructed from the median combination of the dithered science sequence , then science images were sky subtracted and divided by a dome flat .",
    "the images were then registered to a common center and median combined . for each filter , a set of 9 45-s images dithered over a @xmath34  pattern was taken . the separation and position angle of the binary",
    "were taken to be the mean of the values measured in the individual  frames and the uncertainty was derived from the standard deviation of the individual values .",
    "note that the niri altair plate scale has not been fully characterized , we assumed a pixel scale of 21.5mas / pixel , hence the 21.5mas / pix scale used here . ] and adopted a rather conservative 1% uncertainty in the separation of the binary .",
    "the resulting image of the pair is shown in figure[fig1 ] .",
    "the psf elongation is due to the sub - optimal lgs configuration .",
    "simp  j1619 + 0313  was observed on 2008  april  01 and may  29 using the sodium lgs ao system of the 10-meter keck ii telescope on mauna kea , hawaii @xcite .",
    "conditions were photometric for both runs . the facility nirc2 ir camera was used both in narrow ( 10  on a side ) and wide ( 40  on a side ) field - of - view modes .",
    "the lgs provided the wavefront reference source for ao correction , with the exception of tip - tilt motion .",
    "tip - tilt aberrations and quasi - static changes in the image of the lgs as seen by the wavefront sensor were measured contemporaneously with a second , lower - bandwidth wavefront sensor monitoring monitoring a nearby ( @xmath35 ) faint star ( usno - b1.0  0932 - 0296004 , @xmath36  mag ; @xcite ) .    at each epoch , simp  j1619 + 0313  was imaged in a variety of near - ir filters .",
    "we used the @xmath1 ( 1.25  ) , @xmath18 ( 1.64  ) , and @xmath13 ( 2.15  ) broadband filters .",
    "we also used the ch@xmath37s medium - band filter , centered at 1.592  ( bandwidth of 0.126  ) around the @xmath18-band flux typical of t dwarfs . for each filter , a series of dithered images was obtained , offsetting the telescope by a few arc - seconds between every 12 images .",
    "the sodium laser beam was pointed at the center of the nirc2 field - of - view for all observations .",
    "the images were reduced in a standard fashion , first by constructing a flat field from the differences of images of the telescope dome interior , with and without continuum lamp illumination . a master sky frame",
    "was then created from the median of the bias - subtracted , flat - fielded images which was subtracted from individual frames . the results described here",
    "were based on the analysis of individual images and uncertainties were derived from the dispersion of individual measurements .",
    "an analytic model of the point spread function ( psf ) as the sum of three elliptical gaussians was used for estimating the flux ratio and relative positions of simp  j1619 + 0313 s components .",
    "the flux ratio , separation , and position angle of the binary were fitted to individual images in all filters .",
    "the averages of the results were adopted as the final measurements and the standard deviations as the errors .",
    "the relative astrometry was corrected for instrumental optical distortion , based on analysis by b. cameron ( priv .",
    "comm . ) of images of a precisely machined pinhole grid located at the first focal plane of nirc2 .",
    "after applying this distortion correction , the 1@xmath38 residuals of the pinhole images are at the 0.6mas level over the detector field of view .",
    "since the binary separation and the dither steps are relatively small , the effect of the distortion correction is minor .    to convert the instrumental measurements of the binary s separation and pa into celestial units , we used a weighted average of the calibration from @xcite , with a pixel scale of @xmath39mas / pixel and an orientation for the detector s + y  axis of @xmath40 east of north for nirc2 s narrow camera optics @xcite , and @xmath41mas / pixel and @xmath42 for nirc2 s wide camera optics .",
    "these values agree well with keck observatory s notional calibrations of @xmath43mas / pixel ( narrow camera ) , @xmath44  mas / pixel ( wide camera ) , and @xmath45 , as well as the @xmath46  mas / pixel and @xmath47 reported by @xcite for the narrow camera and @xmath48mas / pixel and @xmath49 from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis was performed for simp  j1501 - 0135 ; the uncertainties on separation are dominated by the 1% plate - scale uncertainty ( @xmath16@xmath50mas ) and not by the uncertainties derived from the image - to - image dispersion ( @xmath16@xmath51mas ) .",
    "the astrometric and photometric measurements for simp  j1501 - 0135  and simp  j1619 + 0313  are reported in tables  [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-2 ] , respectively .",
    "reassuringly , the @xmath1 , @xmath18 and @xmath13 contrast ratios measured for simp  j1619 + 0313  obtained with nirc2 ( lgs ao ) and niri ( seeing limited ) are in full agreement despite the very different observational setups .",
    "we derived spectral types for simp  j1501 - 0135a and simp  j1501 - 0135b ( respectively l@xmath52 and l@xmath53 ) using the @xcite and @xcite spectral indices .",
    "for simp  j1619 + 0313a and simp  j1619 + 0313b ( respectively t@xmath54 and t@xmath55 ) we used the @xcite spectral indices . for the former binary , we chose not to use the more recent @xcite indices as they are defined over narrower wavelength intervals and provide little constraint on the spectral type for a noisy spectrum such as that of simp  j1501 - 0135b . in all cases ,",
    "the spectral type was taken to be the mean value derived from all the indices listed in tables [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "for each object , the uncertainty on its spectral type is defined as the dispersion of the measured indices .",

    "the unresolved , far - red , photometry of the simp  j1501 - 0135 system by sdss and megacam is consistent with a mid - l spectral type @xcite , but provides no further constraint on the nature of this binary .",
    "the @xmath18-band spectrum of simp  j1619 + 0313b is nearly identical to that of 2massj2254 + 31 ( t4 ) and its @xmath1- and @xmath19-band spectra also closely match those of this t4 after re - normalization of each band .",
    "simp  j1619 + 0313a has shallower ch@xmath56 absorption in both @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands compared to 2mass1209 - 10 , confirming its slightly earlier spectral type . the spectroscopic indices for both simp  j1619 + 0313a and simp  j1619 + 0313b are representative of objects of their spectral class .",
    "the only spectroscopic index where they fall outside of the bulk of the distribution for early ts is the k / j index ( similar to the @xmath57 color ) .",
    "both simp  j1619 + 0313 and simp  j1501 - 0135 join the short list of l and t dwarfs binaries amenable to spatially resolved observation without the aid of adaptive optics .",
    "this is particularly important as @xmath58@xmath14 m spectroscopy and photometry are useful for characterizing brown dwarfs and ao systems can not , yet , reliably work blueward of @xmath59@xmath14 m .",

    ", the spectral types of both components of a binary can be deduced from their @xmath68 and @xmath69 flux ratio using predetermined @xmath70 and @xmath71 versus spectral type relations ( e.g. : @xcite ) .",

    "we used the mean of the magnitude versus spectral type relations with and without binaries given by @xcite as this is in very good agreement with parallax measurements on a large sample of single l and t dwarfs ( liu , personal communication ) . note that for early and mid - t dwarfs , as is the case for simp  j1619 + 0313 , a fainter secondary in the @xmath1-band could in principle have an earlier spectral type than its primary .",
    "as visible in figure  [ fig5 ] , neither simp  j1501 - 0135 nor simp  j1619 + 0313 fall within the intersect region defined by this diagram ; both systems are challenging to explain with standard models .",
    "for simp  j1501 - 0135 , the l4.5 primary and @xmath1-band flux ratio of 1.79mag would imply a late - t secondary based on @xmath70 versus spectral type relations .",
    "this can readily be discarded from the available spectroscopy .",
    "the strong @xmath18-band ch@xmath56 absorption , the hallmark of t dwarfs , would readily be detected in the resolved niri spectroscopy , but it is absent .",
    "assuming that simp  j1501 - 0135a is itself an unresolved equal - luminosity binary reduces the flux ratio of either component of simp  j1501 - 0135a to simp  j1501 - 0135b by 0.75mag and moves the system to the edge of the allowed region in the diagram shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",

    "the ratio of periods in triple systems with components of similar masses is limited by stability constraints . in stellar systems , this ratio is never less than 5 @xcite , which would correspond to a maximum separation of @xmath73 here . by putting an upper limit to a separation of @xmath74 , using lgs ao observation , allowed us to test period ratios ranging from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "we nevertheless argue that it is the most simple explanation for the odd properties of this system .",
    "one other peculiarity of the simp  j1501 - 0135 system is that it forms one of the widest known field brown dwarf binary , second to the l6+t7.5 system sdss j1416 + 1348ab @xcite .",
    "if the system is indeed a triple , the inner pair , as yet unresolved , could have dynamically excited the outer companion .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy could help to test this hypothesis by verifying if simp  j1501 - 0135a is a double - lined binary .",
    "higher resolution imagery , for example ao on a 30m - class telescope , could also be an observational mean of testing this hypothesis .",
    "the simp  j1501 - 0135 system is similar to the recently reported late - l binary 2mass j0850 + 1057 @xcite .",
    "the resolved photometry of this latter system suggests that the components are l7 for the brighter ( @xmath77mag ) primary and l6 for the secondary .",
    "the possibility that the brightness reversal of this object ( brighter later - type component ) is due to an unresolved primary is explored by @xcite and could be tested through long - term orbital monitoring of the resolved pair or radial velocity .      the spectral type versus @xmath57 diagram for l and t dwarfs shows a mild ( @xmath78mag ) reddening of objects through the l dwarf sequence , followed by a progressively bluer @xmath57 color through the t dwarf sequence ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this overall behavior is understood in terms of the evolution of dust grains through the l dwarfs and their subsequent settling below the photosphere of t dwarfs . however , for any given spectral type , a significant scatter ( @xmath79mag ) remains that is unaccounted for by the observational uncertainties .",
    "this scatter is thought to largely arise from differences in surface gravity , metallicity and dust clouds properties : low gravity and high metallicity accounting for the reddest objects . in that context",
    ", one would expect the two components of a binary to roughly lie at the same location relative to the distribution of field objects of similar types ( see right panel of figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "for example , both components of the l7+t7.5 binary sdss1416 + 1348 @xcite are significantly bluer than field late - ls and late - ts , which could mean the system is relatively old and thus has a high gravity and a low metallicity .",
    "other binaries such as sdss2249 + 0044 , and to a lesser extent 2m1404 - 3159 @xcite , have components that are noticeably redder than field objects and likely to be relatively young and/or metal rich .",
    "the simp  j1619 + 0313  components are remarkable as they straddle the distribution , simp  j1619 + 0313a being bluer than similar - type objects while simp  j1619 + 0313b being redder .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows that simp  j1619 + 0313 falls within the region defined by its flux ratio but it is significantly off from what is expected from its @xmath1 flux ratio .",
    "this is also clearly seen in the spectroscopy shown in figure[fig3 ] .",
    "simp  j1619 + 0313a closely matches the reference t3 , 2mass1209 - 10 , over the whole near - infrared domain . between 1.4@xmath14 m and 2.45@xmath14 m ,",
    "simp  j1619 + 0313b is basically identical to 2massj2254 + 31 , but it is about 0.8mag brighter in the 1.0 - 1.3@xmath14 m interval , as expected from its very blue @xmath80 color .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig2 ] shows the difference between the @xmath2 color of both components of all published binaries that have resolved @xmath1 and to the @xmath2 for mean field dwarfs .",
    "the mean color of field dwarfs as a function of spectral type was calculated from a fourth order polynomial fit to the field l and t dwarfs plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] : @xmath81 , where l0 corresponds to @xmath82 and t8 to @xmath83 .",
    "the figure shows a clear one - to - one correlation between the @xmath2 color offsets of the primary and secondary components .",
    "all published l and t binaries fall within @xmath84@xmath85@xmath38 of the scatter ( 2m1404 - 3159 does so only marginally ) .",
    "simp  j1619 + 0313 is the only known outlier to this distribution , with simp  j1619 + 0313a being 0.25mag redder than a typical t2.5 and simp  j1619 + 0313b being 0.6mag bluer than a typical t4.0 color .",
    "one noteworthy point from the simp  j1619 + 0313 spectroscopy is that the @xmath1-band ki doublets of both components are significantly narrower than for field t dwarfs ( i.e. the @xcite sample ; see figure [ fig7 ] )",
    ". a smaller equivalent width of the ki doublet is generally related to low metallicity @xcite and/or low surface gravity @xcite .",
    "it is unclear how this property relates , if it does , to the peculiar photometric properties of the system .",
    "we propose that the photometric properties of simp  j1619 + 0313  can be explained if the atmosphere of both components is described as a superposition of regions with and without dust - bearing clouds , with very different fractional coverage for simp  j1619 + 0313a and simp  j1619 + 0313b .",
    "this idea has been proposed to explain the photometric properties of l / t transition objects @xcite and the photometric variability of a t2.5 dwarf @xcite .    as a toy model",
    ", we supposed that the emerging flux of each component was the weighted sum of the flux from two types of atmosphere : dust settling or dust - free ( respectively _ cloudy _ and _ clear _ by @xcite ) .",
    "we caution that this description must be seen as a toy model only ; a complete physical description is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "clouds directly impact the pressure - temperature profile of the atmosphere compared to cloud - free models , and only a superposition of two types of regions with the same underlying structure can accurately represent a real atmosphere .",
    "recent models by @xcite address this question in an attempt to explain the l / t transition self - consistently .",
    "simp  j1619 + 0313 would be an interesting test case for such patchy cloud models .    the properties of the pair can be reproduced to first order if simp  j1619 + 0313a is covered by similar fractions of _ clear _ and _ cloudy _",
    "( respectively @xmath86% and @xmath87% ) atmosphere while simp  j1619 + 0313b has a similar temperature with only about @xmath88% of its surface covered by _",
    "clear _ regions .",
    "the derived uncertainties in the filling factors only account for the effects of the accuracy of near - infrared photometry and do not include uncertainties in the models . for both objects we assumed that the _",
    "clear _ phase was 100k warmer than the _ cloudy _ phase . determining the exact temperature difference depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere and requires a detailed physical simulation .",
    "a @xmath76k temperature difference between these two phases has been derived for an early - t dwarf displaying photometric variability @xcite .",
    "figure[fig6 ] shows the best fit superposition of _ clear _ and _ cloudy _ spectra for both components .",
    "these fits predict a @xmath19-band flux difference of 0.06mag between these two components , compared to the observed @xmath89mag .",
    "the lower contrast in the toy model may point toward a slightly larger temperature difference between _ clear _ and _ cloudy _ regions .",
    "it is noteworthy that the derived effective temperature difference between both objects determined from the simplistic model fit done here ( t=@xmath90k and t@xmath91k , for @xmath92t@xmath93k ) is very close to the temperature difference found through the @xcite polynomial fit ( @xmath92t@xmath94k , see table[tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the disappearance of dust in the atmosphere of a t dwarf increases the relative importance of the pressure - broadened ki doublet at @xmath22@xmath14 m , leading to redder @xmath95 and @xmath96 colors for dust - free objects .",
    "the far - red colors of simp  j1619 + 0313ab therefore contain additional constraints to the toy model proposed here , wherein variation of the dust content is the key to explain the odd near - infrared color inversion of this binary .",
    "an interesting result from the far - red photometry is the difference in color @xmath95 and @xmath96 of the two components ; in both colors , the warmer simp  j1619 + 0313a is redder ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) than the cooler simp  j1619 + 0313b ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) .",
    "this is opposite to the overall trend of early - to - mid - t dwarfs which become redder with later spectral types .",
    "it is also opposite to what either _ clear _ or _ cloudy _ models alone would predict .",
    "the toy model proposed earlier provides a natural explanation for this color reversal in far - red colors ; _ cloudy _ models are in both colors bluer than _ clear _ models 100k warmer . for the fractional coverage given earlier , a 1200k _ cloudy _ phase and 1300k _ clear _ phase",
    ", one would expect simp  j1619 + 0313a to be redder than simp  j1619 + 0313b in @xmath96 ( @xmath101mag ) and in @xmath95 ( @xmath102mag ) .",
    "these values are in rough agreement with the differences observed between the components , although in the toy model the two components are bluer in @xmath95 than observed by @xmath103mag .",
    "this could be accounted for by a higher gravity ( @xmath104 ) for both object .",
    "however , it is not possible to fit the near - infrared sed with such a high gravity .",
    "high surface gravity models are bluer in @xmath105 due to an increase in collision - induced absorption by molecular hydrogen in @xmath19 and can not reproduce objects as red as simp  j1619 + 0313b .",
    "lower metallicity , as suggested by the low ki doublet equivalent widths observed for both components of the system ( see figure[fig7 ] ) further increases the @xmath95 and @xmath96 color discrepancy .",
    "models with z=0.3 are bluer in @xmath96 by @xmath106mag compared to solar metallicity ones .",
    "we reported the discovery and characterization of two widely separated brown dwarf binaries : simp  j1501 - 0135 and simp  j1619 + 0313 . based on photometric measurements ,",
    "simp  j1501 - 0135 is most likely to be a triple system , with simp  j1501 - 0135a being a near - equal luminosity mid - l dwarf and simp  j1501 - 0135b a slightly later mid - l .",
    "this system has not been resolved as a triple in ao observations .",
    "this could be due to small physical projected separation at the time of observations and hope remains that future observations may resolve the suspected inner binary .",
    "it is also be possible that the semi - major axis is too small ( @xmath1072au ) to be resolved with current systems . in that case the system s binarity could be tested through very - high resolution spectroscopy to detect double lines or through still higher spatial resolution observation with either non - redundant mask imaging on 10-m class telescopes or future larger observatories .",
    "simp  j1501 - 0135 is expected to have a @xmath108yr orbital period ( total mass @xmath109m@xmath110 ) .",
    "if simp  j1501 - 0135a proves to be an unresolved binary , then the expected orbital period for the outer component will be even larger ; @xmath111yr for a total system mass of @xmath112m@xmath110 .",
    "the simp  j1619 + 0313  components also display odd relative photometric properties : a near - infrared color reversal unlike anything seen in known l or t binaries .",
    "the toy model we presented shows that this inversion can be explained by the two components of the binary having very different dust content .",
    "this scenario may be tested with a more complete characterization of the sed through mid - infrared imaging and far - red spectroscopy .",
    "the relatively wide separation of the system implies that under good observing conditions ( i.e. seeing better than about @xmath113 ) , resolved spectroscopy can be obtained without the aid of adaptive optics , simplifying follow - up work .",
    "simp  j1619 + 0313 is expected to have a @xmath114yr period ( total mass @xmath109m@xmath110 ) .",
