    "another relevant conclusion is that the @xmath66-peak solitons may be clearly considered as bound states of @xmath66 fundamental ones , as suggested by the fact that , as obvious in fig .",
    "2 , the respective powers are related by @xmath67 .    in fact , dependences @xmath59 and shapes of the solitons in the sdf model with @xmath35 are very similar to those known for ordinary gss in the standard model with the kp potential and uniform repulsive nonlinearity , cf",
    "@xcite . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the fundamental and multi - peak gss in the first bandgap are close to their counterparts displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath35 . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , they are essentially different in the second bandgap of the model with @xmath68 ( hence , different from the ordinary gss too ) , showing a trend to flattening .",
    "as said above , a new feature found in the second bandgap of the sdf model with @xmath68 is destabilization of all branches of the gss ( fundamental and multi - peak ones alike ) . as seen in fig .",
    "2(b ) , this happens at small positive values of @xmath39 .",
    "exactly at the stability border ( and close to it , on both sides ) all the solitons feature a flat - top shape , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "deeper into the instability region , the higher - order gss develop _ inverted _ _ shapes _ , with respect to their stable counterparts , see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] : on top of the flat - top background , peaks emerge in empty spaces between the waveguiding channels . in this case",
    ", the fundamental soliton tends to keep a nearly flat - top shape ( although its instability is not essentially weaker than that of its higher - order counterparts ) , featuring a shallow depression in the central guiding channel .",
    "thus , each localized mode that had @xmath66 peaks , and @xmath69 troughs between them , in the stable configuration , develops @xmath69 inverted peaks , in locations of the former troughs , after passing the destabilization threshold ( which corresponds to the flat - top configuration ) .",
    "in fact , this shape transformation suggests that , with the increase of total power @xmath70 , the effective repulsive nonlinear potential becomes stronger than the trapping linear one , pushing the wave into the empty space and destabilizing the trapped state .",
    "when the flat - top fundamental gs becomes unstable , direct simulations demonstrate that growing perturbations slowly destroy it , see fig .",
    "8(a ) . as for unstable flat - top counterparts of stable multi - peak solitons ,",
    "the perturbation first splits them back into a multi - peak structure , and then gradually destroys them .",
    "a typical example of this scenario of the instability development is shown , for the gs of the @xmath63-peak type , in fig . [ fig8](b ) .    at small values of @xmath3 , such as @xmath6 , gss of all types",
    "are found only in the first bandgap .",
    "a peculiarity of the soliton families in this case is that they feature peaks in empty layers , being , nevertheless , _ completely stable _ , on the contrary to their unstable counterparts in the second bandgap found at @xmath36 , which demonstrate a similar structure , as described above .",
    "examples of these stable solitons are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "in addition to the two - peak states displayed above , which may be considered as symmetric bound states of fundamental gss , a family of their antisymmetric (  twisted \" ) bound states can be readily found too .",
    "these bound states turn out to be stable in the first finite bandgap , but unstable in the second , both for @xmath35 and @xmath4 . in the case of @xmath71 , the second bandgap stays empty , as shown above , therefore bound states do not exist in that bandgap either , while twisted bound states of fundamental gss exist and are stable in the first bandgap .",
    "these findings are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] .",
    "an example of the evolution ( gradual destruction ) of an unstable antisymmetric bound state in the second bandgap is shown ( for @xmath36 ) in fig . [ fig12](a ) .",
    "it is known that the combination of a periodic potential and spatially uniform sdf nonlinear term ( whose power may be different from cubic ska ) gives rise to an additional family of weakly unstable _ subfundamental solitons _",
    ", in the second bandgap only .",
    "the solitons were given this name because their total power is smaller than that of the fundamental solitons found in the same bandgap @xcite .",
    "each subfundamental soliton is an antisymmetric one , but it is _ not _ a bound state of fundamental gss , as it is localized as tightly as fundamental solitons ( i.e. , it is a twisted state squeezed , essentially , into a single guiding channel ) .",
    "subfundamental solitons can also be found in the second bandgap of the present model , for @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( they do not exist at @xmath6 , as in that case the second bandgap is empty , as shown above ) . for @xmath36 ,",
    "dependence @xmath59 for the family of subfundamental solitons is shown by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "fig10(a ) , and an example of the subfundamental soliton is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig12](b ) .",
    "similar to the ordinary model , the subfundamental solitons in the present model are weakly unstable , and spontaneously transform themselves into fundamental gss belonging to the first bandgap .",
    "in model with sf the sign of the nonlinear term , solitons can be readily found in the semi - infinite gap .",
    "as might be expected , they are quite similar to solitons previously found in the model with the kp periodic potential and uniform nonlinearity @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , we display a set of respective curves @xmath72 for different values of @xmath3 , and a typical example of a stable soliton , for @xmath6 .",
    "the stability of the entire soliton family complies with the prediction of the vk criterion @xcite , according to which the positive slope of the curve , @xmath73 , is a necessary stability condition ( this criterion is irrelevant to sdf models ) . as concerns the example of the soliton displayed in fig .",
    "fig13 , it is worthy to note that the soliton remains trapped almost entirely within a single waveguiding channel , even when it is narrow ( corresponding to @xmath6 ) . the same feature has been observed in all other cases .     and",
    "@xmath74 , trapped in a narrow channel corresponding to @xmath6.,width=384 ]    in the parameter region investigated in the framework of this work , we have not found multi - peak solitons in the semi - infinite gap .",
    "solitons in finite bandgaps of the sf model were not found either ( unlike the models combining a periodic potential and spatially uniform cubic - quintic nonlinearity , which realizes the competition between sf and sdf terms @xcite ) .",
    "the objective of this work was to develop a systematic analysis of spatial solitons in the model of 1d photonic crystals , built as the periodic alternation of nonlinear waveguiding channels , of width @xmath0 , and empty layers between them , of width @xmath1 .",
    "the main parameter of the model is the structural  duty cycle \" , @xmath75 .",
    "we have concentrated , chiefly , on the model with the sdf ( self - defocusing ) sign of the nonlinearity in the channels , as this setting makes it possible to study new effects due the competition between the linear trapping potential and its effective repulsive nonlinear counterpart .",
    "various types of solitons in this model have been found in the first two finite bandgaps ( alias bragg - reflection gaps ) of the sdf model .",
    "the family of fundamental solitons has been constructed too in the semi - infinite gap ( alias the one accounted for by the total internal reflection ) of the system with the sf ( self - focusing ) nonlinearity . in the sdf model with @xmath35 ,",
    "andalso in the sf one , the solitons are quite similar to their counterparts in the respective models with the uniform nonlinearity . on the other hand ,",
    "the solitons residing in the second bandgap of the sdf model with @xmath76 strongly differ from the ordinary gss : both fundamental solitons and their spatially symmetric bound states pass a destabilization point , with the increase of the total power . at this point ,",
    "the solitons feature a flat - top shape , while beyond it the shape is inverted , with local maxima emerging in empty layers . the shape inversion and destabilization of the solitons",
