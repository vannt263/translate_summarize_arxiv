    "<S> the eternal inflation paradigm posits that bubbles occupied by different vacua continuously nucleate , expand , and collide with each other amid an eternally inflating false vacuum . in the thin wall approximation @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> a nucleation event is described by a saddle point of the euclidean action @xmath0 with a single negative mode . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is the energy density and @xmath2 denotes the tension of a thin wall , whose contribution is confined to the world - volume selected by the @xmath3-function . </S>",
    "<S> generically , more than one generation of bubbles is expected to occur : starting in a false vacuum , typically a ( first generation ) bubble of intermediate vacuum will host a number of ( second generation ) bubbles of true vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> such histories are associated with saddle points of ( [ action0 ] ) with two negative modes , one for each nucleation .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper points out that the cylindrically symmetric saddle points discovered in @xcite mediate a novel class of second generation nucleation events  the formation of `` barnacles . '' </S>",
    "<S> these objects are loci of different wall tension that are adjacent to regions filled with a third vacuum ; they can nucleate on walls of first generation bubbles . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows i explain how to compute the rate of barnacle formation . </S>",
    "<S> i also point out that barnacle production leads to the same observational consequences as the extensively studied bubble collision scenario @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , but is far more generic : the expected number of barnacles in our past lightcone is exponentially larger than the expected number of collisions when these quantities can be meaningfully compared .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a potential landscape containing at least three nondegenerate vacua : a false vacuum a , an intermediate vacuum b and a true vacuum c. denote the respective vacuum energies @xmath4 etc . and vacuum energy differences @xmath5 etc . </S>",
    "<S> working in the thin wall approximation , one defines three wall tensions @xmath6 and writes down action ( [ action0 ] ) . when the vacua b and c decouple , that is when @xmath7 , the euclidean partition function for a false vacuum region of volume @xmath8 is simply : @xmath9 when transitions to vacuum b are turned on but c remains inaccessible ( @xmath10 ) , the partition function includes contributions from saddle points with a single negative mode . </S>",
    "<S> these are the familiar spherical instantons portrayed in the left column of table  [ saddles ] . </S>",
    "<S> summing over all @xmath11-instanton sectors , one gets : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is a determinant factor coming from a saddle point evaluation of the path integral . </S>",
    "<S> it is imaginary , because the saddle point has a single negative mode . </S>",
    "<S> the action of the instanton is given by @xmath14 with the volumes of the four - dimensional ball and three - dimensional sphere evaluated at the critical radius @xmath15 overall , the net effect of nucleations of b - bubbles is to shift the effective vacuum energy density of a by an imaginary term , interpreted as the rate of decay of vacuum a : @xmath16    .saddle points of the thin wall action , which appear as successive wall tensions are set to finite values , organized by the number of negative modes , i.e. the generation to which the corresponding decay channel belongs . </S>",
    "<S> closed regions drawn in black / white are filled with intermediate ( b ) / true ( c ) vacuum ; the outside region is the false vacuum ( a ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     barnacles of types iii and iv ( see table  [ allsols ] ) may also pop up on walls separating the true and the false vacuum ( as opposed to true and intermediate , discussed above ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , they are filled with the intermediate vacuum and therefore their walls accelerate away from the center of the true vacuum bubble . indeed , for an observer living in the true vacuum c , the only instabilities of the world around her are ( a ) barnacles on the walls surrounding her bubble , and ( b ) nucleations of new bubbles in the mother vacuum , which may subsequently collide with her bubble . </S>",
    "<S> the observational consequences of the latter scenario ( if we live in a bubble of vacuum c ) have been studied in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as we realize the importance of barnacles , the first question is : how do the observational signatures of barnacle formation differ from a bubble collision ?    </S>",
    "<S> the answer is that they do not differ at all . </S>",
    "<S> the analyses of @xcite rely on a single starting point : that the wall surrounding our bubble contains an @xmath17-invariant patch of different wall tension , which accelerates away from the center of our bubble . </S>",
    "<S> all observational consequences of bubble collisions  from a cmb cold / hot spot @xcite and its associated polarization pattern @xcite to galaxy flow @xcite , follow from this single input . </S>",
    "<S> but this input is shared by the barnacle : it also leads to an @xmath17-invariant patch of different wall tension , which accelerates away from us whenever a collision - formed domain wall would . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the hitherto reported observational signatures of bubble collisions apply in their entirety to barnacle formation .    </S>",
    "<S> this motivates the next question : which is more generic ? </S>",
    "<S> the existence of barnacles relies on there being at least one extra vacuum , in addition to the two vacua inside and outside the observer s bubble . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , bubble collisions occur also in the absence of other vacua in the landscape  in which case the colliding bubbles are filled with the same vacuum and no domain wall forms between them .    </S>",
    "<S> i now argue that if a third vacuum exists , a barnacle scenario is far more generic than the bubble collision scenario . </S>",
    "<S> i need two preliminaries for this discussion . </S>",
    "<S> the first is that consistency with observations requires all domain walls to accelerate away from us , so our vacuum must be the true vacuum c. the second is that for any given choice of landscape parameters , precisely one of the four types of barnacles displayed in table  [ allsols ] exists @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> i begin by focusing on the part of parameter space , where barnacles are of types iii or iv . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to think of barnacles as populating the surface of the wall of our spherical , c - vacuum bubble . </S>",
    "<S> it is then meaningful to ask how many barnacles are expected to be visible in our past lightcone and how that number compares with the expected count of visible collision events .    </S>",
    "<S> ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite computed the expected number of bubble collisions in our past lightcone . in terms of quantities defined in the present paper , </S>",
    "<S> their result reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 is newton s constant . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath20 denotes the two - dimensional cross - sectional area of wall intersecting our past lightcone ( ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite approximated the wall as null ) . in a particular cosmological model </S>",
    "<S> , the area @xmath20 will be determined by the energy density in the vicinity of our vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> if a bubble nucleated in false vacuum is to hit the area @xmath20 , it must form no farther away than the false vacuum horizon length @xmath21 , both in space and time . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath22 measures the four - volume of false vacuum where bubble nucleations ( of either type ) lead to collisions .    in the case of the barnacle </S>",
    "<S> , one can make a similar estimate . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant decay rate is @xmath23 , the rate per wall three - volume . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we must write down the three - volume of wall that is contained within our past lightcone . in particular , we must recognize that the wall is not null . indeed , recall that its lorentzian evolution is given by a three - dimensional hyperboloid @xmath24 if @xmath20 denotes the same cross - sectional area as above , it is easy to show that the desired three - volume is proportional to @xmath25 ( consistently with dimensional analysis ) . using @xmath26 , the expected number of barnacles in our past lightcone is : @xmath27 comparing eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ collisioncount ] ) and ( [ barnaclecount ] ) , we see that barnacles dominate over bubble collisions if @xmath28 hold . on the left hand sides , the exponents are large and positive , generically of the same order as @xmath29 itself @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , violating ( [ condition ] ) would be tantamount to stipulating that the magnitudes of the decay rates @xmath30 are controlled as much by the determinant factors @xmath31 as by the exponentials . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that in models where barnacles are of types iii or iv , they are more abundant than bubble collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> barnacles of types i and ii cover half or more of the wall surrounding the region occupied by the true vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> thus , models that give rise to these types of barnacles can not realize a scenario wherein the walls of our initially spherical bubble create multiple barnacles that produce azimuthal anisotropies in the cmb . instead , in such models the observable universe is the barnacle itself . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmology inside a barnacle is axisymmetric and gives rise to azimuthal features without the need of any collisions . </S>",
    "<S> if planck and other experiments detect the azimuthal signatures discussed in @xcite , should we infer that we live in a type i / ii barnacle or that we have seen a bubble collision ? as an inference problem , </S>",
    "<S> the answer depends on the prior probability of each of these scenarios  i.e. a choice of cosmological measure .    in any case </S>",
    "<S> , it would appear that barnacles are a more robust mechanism for producing axisymmetric cosmological signatures than are bubble collisions . </S>",
    "<S> if the underlying parameters place us in a type iii / iv scenario , barnacle nucleations are more frequent than collisions . in a type </S>",
    "<S> i / ii scenario , barnacles guarantee the presence of azimuthal effects while bubble collisions require the occurrence rate ( [ collisioncount ] ) to be sufficiently high .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of possible extensions could place barnacle - related cosmologies on a firmer footing . </S>",
    "<S> the barnacle saddle points involve junctions  </S>",
    "<S> loci where three types of walls coalesce . ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite does not contain a proof that the requisite solutions to microscopic field equations exist . </S>",
    "<S> further , the analysis of @xcite does not include gravity , which significantly affects nucleation rates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in lorentzian signature barnacles grow on the surface of the host wall </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to understand what happens when two barnacles collide .    on the other hand , the finding that barnacles are more generic than , but observationally indistinguishable from , bubble collisions is intriguing . </S>",
    "<S> i discussed above the relevance of barnacles to the program of using cosmological observations to extract evidence for the string landscape . beyond that </S>",
    "<S> , barnacles should be important for a conceptual understanding of eternal inflation . because barnacles contain regions where three vacua and three walls coalesce , they lead to nontrivial correlations between which vacua occupy spacelike - separated points . </S>",
    "<S> this should have a bearing for qualitative and quantitative studies of eternal inflation such as @xcite .    on a more formal level , to my knowledge </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents the first exposition of the role of euclidean saddle points with two or more negative modes . </S>",
    "<S> prior studies @xcite have specifically emphasized that only saddle points with a single negative mode are relevant to instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> this statement holds for decay channels of _ empty vacua _ , but it does not apply to instabilities of other objects , such as walls created in prior nucleations . </S>",
    "<S> the main conclusion of the present paper is that at least in the context of vacuum decay , all saddle points correspond to decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> for saddle points whose components can not be taken arbitrarily far apart , the number of negative directions corresponds to the generation , in which the decay occurs . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a saddle point with @xmath32 negative modes represents a decay channel of a metastable configuration , which is itself a product of @xmath33 prior decay events . </S>"
