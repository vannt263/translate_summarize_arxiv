    "atmospheric surface layer motions are a source of many challenging problems .",
    "the issue of designing a faithful statistical model of spatio - temporal wind speed fluctuations has been addressed in various fields like boundary layer turbulence phenomenology , meteorology , wind power control and prediction or climatology . from turbulent gusts to hurricanes , breezes to geostrophic wind , the wind process is characterized by a wide range of spatio - temporal scales and all the above mentioned disciplines mainly focus on a specific subrange of scales .",
    "the modeling of wind speed behavior in the mesoscale range is of great interest for example in wind power generation or in order to control polluant dispersion . in this range of scales extending from few minutes to few days ( @xmath0 1 - 1000 km )",
    ", the properties of wind velocities are less known than in the range of planetary motions ( synoptic scales ) or turbulent motions ( microscales ) @xcite . from a physical point of view , because of the importance of boundary conditions , the heterogeneous and non - stationary nature of the processes involved , it is well admitted that mesoscale wind regimes strongly depend upon various factors like atmospheric conditions , the nature of the terrain and may involve periodic variations ( caused by diurnal temperature variations ) . unlike microscale kolmogorov homogeneous turbulence , mesoscale fluctuations are therefore not expected to possess any degree of universality @xcite . however , during past few years , some papers have been devoted to the analysis of scaling laws and intermittency features at large scales in many geophysical signals like temperature , rainfall or wind speeds @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors showed that surface layer wind velocities recorded at low frequency using a cup anemometer display multiscaling properties very much like in the high frequency turbulent regime .",
    "moreover , they claimed that random cascade models could be pertinent to reproduce the observed intermittent fluctuations .",
    "along the same line , in @xcite , a multifractal detrended analysis was performed on four different hourly wind speed records and revealed some multiscaling properties of the series . even if these studies did not go beyond simple scaling exponent estimation and did not consider problems related to the statistical significance of the obtained results , they had the merit to address questions about the possible intermittent nature of wind variations in the mesoscale range .",
    "as reviewed below , one of the consequences of multiscaling and intermittency is that small scales fluctuations are strongly non gaussian and characterized by `` bursty '' behavior . in refs .",
    "@xcite , such features have been precisely observed on wind variations statistics at largest microscales ( or at smallest mesoscales ) and have been shown to be related to a `` fluctuating '' log - normal turbulent intensity .    in this paper",
    "we suggest that this  fluctuating turbulent intensity  results from a random cascading process initiated at a time scale of few days . our aim is to show that , in some sense ,  turbulent  cascade models are likely to be pertinent at larger scales , in the so - called mesoscale regime .",
    "as compared to the previously cited papers , our analysis relies upon the use of magnitude ( i.e. logarithms of velocity increments amplitudes ) correlation functions . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", long - range correlated magnitudes have been shown to be at the heart of the construction of continuous cascade processes @xcite .",
    "for a practical point of view , magnitude covariance possesses interesting properties as far as statistical estimation problems are concerned @xcite .",
    "we show that these correlation functions can be reliably estimated and are very similar to those associated with longitudinal velocity time series of laboratory turbulent experiments .",
    "moreover we observe some universal features among the various analyzed series .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s_ma ] , we make a brief review of intermittency and the related notion of random cascade models .",
    "we emphasize on the interest of studying magnitude correlations and discuss its relationship with multiscaling properties .",
    "we then compare , on an empirical ground , the relative performances of intermittency estimators relying upon scaling and magnitude covariance .",
    "this section ends with a review of a recent work of b. castaing that has shown how intermittency in lagrangian and eulerian frames is `` observed '' on time series recorded at a fixed spatial position .",
    "our main experimental results are then presented in section [ s_sa ] . after a rapid description of various wind data",
    "we have studied , we show that wind surface layer variations in mesoscale range have intermittent properties and possess `` universal '' magnitude covariance similar to laboratory turbulent fluctuations . discussions and prospects are reported in section [ s_cp ] .",
    "small scale intermittency is one of the most challenging problems in contemporary turbulence research .",
    "it is generally associated with two distinctive features : the first one is that at small scales the probability density functions ( pdf ) of velocity variations are strongly leptokurtic ( with  stretched exponential \" tails ) while they are almost gaussian at larger scales .",
    "the second one is that the so - called structure functions display multiscaling properties .",
    "as we shall see , these two properties are in fact equivalent within the multiplicative cascade picture .",
    "let us make a brief overview of these notions .",
    "we denote @xmath1 a continuous process ( for instance the time variations of a velocity field component at a fixed location ) and let @xmath2 be its increments over a scale @xmath3 : @xmath4 .",
    "one usually defines the order @xmath5 structure function of @xmath6 as @xmath7 and the @xmath8 spectrum as the scaling exponent of @xmath9 : @xmath10 if the function @xmath8 is non - linear one says that @xmath1 is a multifractal process or an intermittent process . in that case , as shown e.g. in @xcite , @xmath8 is necessarily a concave function and the previous scaling holds in the range of small @xmath3 ; @xmath11 means precisely @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a coarse scale called the integral scale in turbulence ( in general associated with the injection scale ) .",
    "the intermittency coefficient is a positive number that quantifies the non - linearity of @xmath8 and can be defined as , e.g. , @xmath14 the most common example of non linear @xmath8 function is the so - called _ log - normal _ spectrum which is a simple parabola : @xmath15 in that case @xmath16 corresponds to the constant curvature of @xmath8 .    in order to estimate the multiscaling properties and/or the intermittency coefficient",
    ", one can directly estimate partition functions from the data and obtain the exponent @xmath8 from a least square fit of @xmath9 in log - log representation .",
    "however this method suffers from various drawbacks .",
    "first , from a fundamental point of view , one has to distinguish temporal ( or spatial ) averages from ensemble averages .",
    "for instance , in the case of a log - normal multifractal , rigorously speaking , only the `` ensemble '' average @xmath17 behaves as a power law with an exponent @xmath8 as given by eq . .",
    "the temporal or spatial average has an exponent spectrum @xmath8 that becomes linear above some value of @xmath5 and is no longer parabolic @xcite . in order to estimate @xmath8 from moment",
    "scaling over a wide range of @xmath5 one has to use the so - called `` mixed '' asymptotic framework @xcite .",
    "but the main problem remains that high order moment estimates require very large sample size .",
    "moreover the scaling behavior can also be altered by finite size effects , discreteness and non stationarity effects like periodic perturbations or periodic modulations of the data ( see below ) . a more reliable method first introduced in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) relies upon the so - called magnitude cumulant analysis .",
    "it simply consists in focusing on the scaling behavior of partition functions around @xmath18 . according to this approach",
    ", the structure function is written as : @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the k - th cumulant associated with the random variable @xmath21 .",
    "the logarithm of the increment will henceforth be referred to as the _ magnitude _ of velocity increments .",
    "note that @xmath22 is simply the mean value of @xmath23 while @xmath24 is its variance .",
    "thanks to the scaling relationship , one deduces that all cumulants behave as : @xmath25 where the constants @xmath26 account for both the integral scale and the prefactors in the scaling relationship . the function @xmath8 can therefore be expressed in terms of a cumulant expansion : @xmath27 in particular one sees that the intermittency coefficient is directly involved in the behavior of the magnitude variance as : @xmath28 eq . has been successfully used to estimate the intermittency coefficient of longitudinal velocity fields in 3d fully developed regime under various experimental conditions .",
    "a common value close to @xmath29 has been obtained .",
    "it is remarkable that this intermittency value appears to be universal @xcite .",
    "let us end this brief review by discussing the relationship between intermittency and the small scale `` bursty '' behavior of velocity increments .",
    "indeed , it is well known in turbulence laboratory experiments that large scale increment pdf are close to be normal while small scales have larger tails .",
    "the flateness strongly increases when one goes from large to small scales .",
    "we focus only on the log - normal case , i.e. , a parabolic @xmath8 , extension of our considerations to other laws being straightforward .",
    "thanks to the structure function multiscaling interpreted as a moment equality , by simply performing a time scale contraction , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 )",
    ", one can write : @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a gaussian random variable of variance @xmath34",
    "which law is denoted as @xmath35 . by simply assuming that for @xmath36 ( @xmath13 being the integral scale ) , the increments of @xmath6 are normally distributed ,",
    "one obtains the small scale pdf of @xmath37 by the well known castaing formula @xcite : @xmath38    this means that , at scale @xmath3 , the pdf of the increments of the process @xmath1 are obtained as a superposition of gaussian distributions of variance @xmath39 where @xmath40 is itself a gaussian random variable of variance increasing at small scales like @xmath41 . the smaller the scale , the larger the variance of @xmath40 and therefore the larger the tails of the increment pdf @xmath42 .",
    "the continuous deformation from gaussian at large scales towards stretched exponential like shapes at small scales , observed in laboratory turbulence experiments , has been shown to be well accounted by the transformation .",
    "a natural question that arises after the previous analysis is how can we explicitely build models that possess multiscaling properties ?",
    "in other words , since multiscaling is equivalent to intermittency , how can the variance of the magnitude increase as a logarithm of the scale as described by eq . ?",
    "the answer comes from the self - similarity eq .",
    "that can be iterated and interpreted as a random cascade : when one goes from large to small scales , one multiplies the process by a random variable @xmath43 .",
    "usually one starts by building a non - decreasing ( i.e. with positive variations ) cascade process , denoted hereafter as @xmath44 , which is often referred to as a multifractal _ measure _ though its variations are not bounded .",
    "more general multifractal processes ( or multifractal `` walks '' ) can be simply obtained by considering a simple brownian motion @xmath45 ( or any self - similar random process ) compounded with the measure @xmath44 considered as a stochastic time : @xmath46 $ ] . in finance literature @xmath44",
    "is often referred to as the trading time while in turbulence @xmath44 can be associated with the spatial or temporal distribution of energy dissipation .",
    "the statistical properties of @xmath1 can be directly deduced from those of @xmath44 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "random multiplicative cascades measures were originally introduced as models of the energy cascade in fully developed turbulence .",
    "after the early works of mandelbrot @xcite , a lot of mathematical studies have been devoted to discrete random cascades @xcite .",
    "let us summarize the main properties of these constructions , set some notations and see how these notions extend to continuous cascades .",
    "the simplest multifractal discrete cascades are the dyadic cascades defined by the following iterative rule : one starts with some interval of constant density and splits this interval in two equal parts .",
    "the density of the two sub - intervals is obtained by multiplying the original density by two ( positive ) independent random factors @xmath47 of same law .",
    "this operation is then repeated _",
    "ad infinitum_. the integral scale corresponds to the size of the starting interval .",
    "a log - normal cascade corresponds to @xmath48 where @xmath40 is normally distributed .",
    "peyrire and kahane @xcite proved that this construction converges almost surely towards a stochastic non decreasing process @xmath49 provided @xmath50 .",
    "the multifractality of @xmath49 ( hereafter simply denoted as @xmath51 ) and of @xmath52 ( @xmath45 being a brownian motion ) has been studied by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) and it is straightforward to show that the spectrum of @xmath1 is @xmath53 the self - similarity eq . for dilation factors",
    "@xmath54 can also be directly deduced from the construction .",
    "because the discrete cascade construction involves dyadic intervals and a top - bottom construction it is far from being stationary . in order",
    "to get rid of theses drawbacks , continuous cascade constructions have been recently proposed and studied on a mathematical ground @xcite .",
    "they share exact multifractal scaling with discrete cascades but they display continuous scaling and possess stationary increments @xcite . without entering into details , we just want to stress that these constructions rely upon a family of infinitely divisible random processes @xmath55 .",
    "the process @xmath44 is obtained as the weak limit , when @xmath56 , of @xmath57 . in the log - normal case ,",
    "@xmath58 is simply a gaussian process defined by a covariance function that mimics the behavior of discrete cascade . indeed , as shown in @xcite , if @xmath52 where @xmath44 is a discrete cascade as defined previously with intermittency coefficient @xmath16 , then correlation function @xmath59 of the magnitude @xmath60 decreases slowly as a logarithm function : @xmath61 \\simeq -\\lambda^2 \\ln(\\frac{\\delta t}{t+\\tau } ) ~~{\\mbox{for lags}}~ \\delta t \\leq t.\\ ] ] the integral scale @xmath13 where cascading process `` starts '' can therefore be interpreted as a _ correlation length _ for the variation log - amplitudes of @xmath1 .",
    "the so - called multifractal random walk ( mrw ) process introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite consists in constructing a log - normal multifractal process @xmath52 where @xmath45 is a brownian motion and @xmath62 where the @xmath63 is a gaussian process with a logarithmic covariance as given in eq . .",
    "in fig . [ fig_est](a ) and [ fig_est](b ) are plotted respectively a sample of a log - normal measure @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) and a path of a mrw process @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    the studies devoted to continuous versions of discrete cascades have mainly shown that multifractal processes are related to exponential of logarithmic correlated random processes . the magnitude covariance function has been proven to be at the heart of the notion of `` continuous cascade '' . as we shall see below , it also allows one to estimate the intermittency coefficient in a more reliable way than methods based on scaling properties .",
    "as far as the problem of the estimation of the intermittency coefficient is concerned , it results from previous discussion that this coefficient , originally defined as the curvature of @xmath8 ( eq . ) , can be estimated either from the behavior of magnitude variance across scales ( eq . ) or from the slope of the time magnitude covariance in lin - log coordinates ( eq . ) .     and @xmath67 .",
    "in ( c ) are plotted the magnitude covariance ( @xmath68 ) and magnitude variance ( @xmath69 ) as a function respectively of the logarithm of the lag and the logarithm of the scale .",
    "the slope of both curves provides an estimation of @xmath16 .",
    "one can see that for measure @xmath64 , the errors in the estimation are comparable . in ( d ) are displayed the same plots as in ( c ) but for the magnitude of the mrw process .",
    "because of the additive noise and the small number of independent points at large scales , the estimation relying upon the magnitude variance turns out to be much more altered .",
    ", width=377 ]    let us show that this latter definition is much more reliable than former one .",
    "the precise computation of the properties of estimators relying upon eqs and is a difficult task . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that a generalized method of moments relying on the magnitude correlation function provides an unbiased and consistent estimator of @xmath16 .",
    "estimators relying on eq . have been precisely discussed within the context of atmospheric turbulence in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors showed that it allowed one , by means of a bootstrap method called `` surrogate analysis '' , to estimate @xmath16 and distinguish intermittent from non intermittent time series .",
    "a simple argument allows us to understand why magnitude covariance based estimation ( eq . ) is better than scale magnitude cumulant analysis ( eq . ) in the case of multifractal random walks .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_est ] where both estimators are compared for a sample of a multifractal random measure constructed from a log - normal continuous cascade ( fig . [ fig_est](a ) ) and a mrw process ( fig . [ fig_est](b ) ) .",
    "one sees in fig .",
    "[ fig_est](c ) , that in the case one handles directly the random cascade measure , both estimators are roughly equivalent .",
    "however , in the case of a mrw process , the measure is not directly observed since it represents the stochastic variance of the random walk . in this situation ,",
    "the estimates based on magnitude covariance are better than those obtained from the magnitude variance scaling ( fig . [ fig_est](d ) ) .",
    "this feature can be explained as follows : if one considers that for continuous cascades processes , eq .",
    "is an equality in law for all finite dimensional distributions ( f.d.d . ) , by taking the logarithm , one gets : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a log - correlated gaussian random variable ( eq . ) which variance behaves like in eq . while @xmath72 is a standardized normal white noise independent of @xmath73 .",
    "note that in the case of a multifractal measure , there is no noise term @xmath74 ) and the estimation error is small as compared to the situation of mrw when this term is present .",
    "one can then assume that the estimation error mainly comes from the presence of @xmath74 .",
    "this error is thus expected to decrease , in both cases , as @xmath75 if @xmath76 is the number of effective independent samples of the considered signal .",
    "this effective number is proportional to the overall sample size but decreases with the scale @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , since at scale @xmath3 , the effective number of independent points is @xmath77 , if one fits eq . over the range of scale extending from @xmath78 to @xmath79 ,",
    "the mean error is roughly proportional to @xmath80 . on the other hand , by fitting eq . at scale @xmath81 from lags @xmath82 to @xmath83 ,",
    "one expects an approximately constant error of @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , the error in the computation of the variance is proportional to the square root fourth moment of @xmath85 while the error in the covariance is proportional to the second moment .",
    "since the ratio between these two quantities is 3 , the ratio of errors between the two methods is of order : @xmath86    let us notice that , rigorously , the error also depends on the overall range of values used to apply the linear regression and thus one expects , in the case of an estimation relying upon eq .",
    ", there is an optimal range of scale to perform the fit .",
    "this optimum results , on the one hand , from a reduction of the error when one increases the fitting range of scales and , on the other hand , from the increasing of the error associated with the small number of independent points at large scales ( see ref .",
    "@xcite where such a problem is considered in details ) .",
    "we have performed extensive monte - carlo estimations using synthetic log - normal continuous cascades and we have checked that for parameters , sample sizes and range of scales close to the experimental values considered below ( see section [ s_sa ] ) , the observed ratio between the errors is @xmath87 in agreement with previous considerations . the intermittency coefficient of a random cascade is thus estimated in a much more reliable way using magnitude correlation functions .",
    "in most fluid mechanics experiments , one usually records one or several components of the velocity field using an anemometer , so one has only access to the values of the field at a fixed spatial position as a function of time . in order to make inferences on the spatial properties of the velocity , i.e. , the eulerian field , one generally invokes the taylor frozen hypothesis or , when the turbulence rate is large , the tenekes sweeping argument according to which small scale velocity fluctuations are mainly caused by eulerian variations advected by large scale random motions @xcite .",
    "however , as explained below , for some functions , single point measurements can not be linked so easily to their eulerian counterpart .",
    "hereafter , we reproduce the argument of b. castaing @xcite in order to understand the shape of the single point magnitude covariance if one supposes that both eulerian and lagrangian velocity fluctuations are given by a continuous cascade as described previously .",
    "let us denote @xmath88 the magnitude at time @xmath89 and position @xmath90 .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath88 is a local field that does not depend on any spatial or time scale ( for example in turbulence , @xmath88 can be considered as the logarithm of the dissipation field or of the velocity increments at a scale smaller than the kolmogorov dissipation scale ) .    our goal is to compute @xmath91\\ ] ] as a function of the time lag @xmath92 for a fixed value of @xmath90 .    if one supposes that both eulerian and lagrangian fields @xmath40 are log - correlated , i.e. , well described by a continuous cascade model , then @xmath93 & = & \\lambda^2 \\ln(\\frac{l}{r+\\eta_e } ) \\\\",

    "these data have been measured and collected by the french meteorological service of climatology ( meteo - france ) using a cup anemometer and wind vane at @xmath122 meters above ground level .",

    "we assume that all seasonal effects have been removed from the estimated field @xmath124 .",

    "[ fig_corr1 ] , when one plots @xmath131 as a function of @xmath132 one observes , for all series , a decreasing linear function that becomes zero above some lag @xmath13 .",

    "the framework of intermittent statistics and random cascade models can be applied to address problems related to wind resources assessing , extreme events characterization or to design a simple stochastic model in order to perform short term wind predictions @xcite .",

    "<S> we study various time series of surface layer wind velocity at different locations and provide evidences for the intermittent nature of the wind fluctuations in mesoscale range . by means of the magnitude covariance analysis , which is shown to be a more efficient tool to study intermittency than classical scaling analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we find that all wind series exhibit similar features than those observed for laboratory turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest the existence of a  universal  cascade mechanism associated with the energy transfer between synoptic motions and turbulent microscales in the atmospheric boundary layer . </S>"
