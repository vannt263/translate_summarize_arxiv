    "despite their proximity , the stars within 10  pc of the sun remain an incompletely characterized population .",
    "this assessment is especially true for very - low - mass ( vlm ; @xmath2 ) dwarfs , whose low luminosities ( @xmath3 ) retard comprehensive studies of their intrinsic properties and numerical abundance .",
    "for example , the empirical mass  luminosity relation ( mlr ) for late - m dwarfs is only sparsely sampled @xcite , and its extension to the cooler l and t dwarfs is completely uncharted . also ,",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) of the nearest vlm stars is unsettled , as m dwarfs within 10  pc continue to be identified as companions ( @xcite ; this paper ) and in isolation @xcite . only by exhaustively searching for faint nearby stars and closely - separated companions can the mlr and lf be sufficiently well determined to yield a definitive mass function of vlm stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "since july 1997 , we have conducted a `` snapshot '' search for vlm companions to all known stars within 10  pc using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) .",
    "our search spans the circumstellar region 02@xmath4 from each target star , which corresponds to 2100  au for the most distant stars in our sample .",
    "this region bridges the 010  au search - spaces of speckle - interferometry and radial - velocity surveys @xcite and the 1001000  au search - spaces of deep , near - infrared imaging surveys @xcite . with ultimate detection limits of @xmath5 and @xmath6 at 10  pc @xcite ,",
    "our nicmos search is sensitive to companions that are at least 10 magnitudes fainter than the empirical end of the hydrogen - burning main sequence @xcite and at least 6 magnitudes fainter than the archetypal t dwarf , gj  229b @xcite .",
    "the targets in our nicmos snapshot program have been observed sporadically over seven years in order to fill small ( @xmath7  min ) gaps in the _ hst _ observing schedule . to date , single - epoch images of 239 stars in 191 systems have been recorded .",
    "these observations represent 72% of the _ hst _ pointings required to survey all the stars and brown dwarfs within 10  pc identified astrometrically before 1 january 2004 .",
    "( we treat known systems with separations less than @xmath8 as individual _ hst _ targets . ) in this paper  the ninth of the `` the solar neighborhood '' series produced by the research consortium on nearby stars ( recons )  we report the discoveries of vlm companions to three nearby m and l dwarfs ( g  23925 , gj  1001b , and lhs  224 ) and we confirm companions to two other m dwarfs ( gj  54 and gj  84 ) .",
    "all but one of these binary dwarfs have projected separations less than 5  au .",
    "we discuss the potential impact of these companions on the mlr , and we update the state of multiplicity among presently known members of the recons `` 10  pc sample . ''",
    "table  1 contains basic information about the five m and l dwarfs to which we report newly discovered or confirmed vlm companions .",
    "information about gj  1001a ( also known as lhs  102a ) is also included to provide a full description of the gj  1001 system .",
    "table  2 is a log of initial and follow - up observations of each dwarf conducted with nicmos , the _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and fine guidance sensor 1r ( fgs1r ) , and the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) 3.5  m telescope at apache point observatory .",
    "we now describe these observations in detail .",
    "each dwarf was observed at a single epoch with nicmos camera  2 ( nic2 ) , which has a pixel scale of 0076 and a field - of - view ( fov ) of 195  @xmath9  195 @xcite .",
    "the dwarfs were acquired as close to the center of the nic2 field as the uncertainties in their coordinates and proper motions allowed .",
    "images were recorded in fine - guidance mode through the f110w , f180 m , f207 m , and f222 m filters ( table  3 ) , which alternately sample the 1@xmath10 m spectra of putative brown - dwarf companions outside and inside the ch@xmath11 absorption bands at 1.6@xmath12 m and 2.2@xmath13 m . figures  [ golimowski.fig1]a and [ golimowski.fig1]b show that this combination of filters permits easy discrimination of late - m , l , and t dwarfs from most background stars .",
    "we use this color discrimination and expectations based on galactic latitude to identify candidate vlm companions among the many faint sources often imaged in a target field .",
    "images through each filter were recorded using nicmos s multiple - accumulate ( multiaccum ) mode , which allows the detector to be read nondestructively in predefined sampling sequences .",
    "two sets of exposures totalling 64  s were recorded through each of the f110w and f180 m filters , and two sets of exposures totalling 128  s were recorded through each of the f207 m and f222 m filters .",
    "all sets of exposures were recorded using a logarithmic sampling sequence that provides large dynamic range among the constituent images .",
    "the images were reduced using the standard nicmos calibration software @xcite and appropriate reference images and tables .",
    "the calibration software combines the constituent images of each sampling sequence so that values of pixels ultimately affected by cosmic - ray impacts or saturation are replaced by appropriately scaled values of those pixels sampled before the contaminating event .",
    "consequently , the lost data in the reduced images are limited to instrinsically bad pixels and/or pixels that were saturated before the first nondestructive read of the detector ( i.e. , within the first 0.303  s of the exposure ) .",
    "figure  [ golimowski.fig2 ] shows the set of reduced and calibrated images obtained for a typical target , namely , the binary m dwarf gj  84ab .",
    "to facilitate the detection of faint companions in the reduced images , we subtracted the point - spread functions ( psfs ) of the target stars in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "first , we selected reference psfs for each target and filter from the large collection of single - star images recorded during our snapshot survey .",
    "the reference psfs for a given target were those that best matched not only the brightness , spectral type , and field position of the target , but also the location of nic2 s migratory cold mask at the time of the observation .",
    "the reference psfs were then iteratively shifted , scaled , and subtracted from the target images until the residuals were visually minimized .",
    "figure  [ golimowski.fig3 ] shows the results of this technique for the images of gj  84ab shown in figure  [ golimowski.fig2 ] .",
    "our imaging and processing strategies yield sensitivities to faint companions that are dependent on the brightness of the target , the quality of the psf subtraction , and the field position .",
    "@xcite reported our detection limits at various angular distances from representative targets whose psf - subtracted images are of average quality .",
    "we measured the apparent magnitudes of unsaturated and well - separated targets and field sources using conventional aperture photometry . to convert instrumental count rates to vega - based magnitudes , we used aperture corrections computed for our selection of nicmos filters @xcite and the conversion recipe described in the _ hst _ data handbook for nicmos @xcite :    @xmath14^{-1 } ) + zp({\\rm vega}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the bandpass - averaged flux density for a source producing a count rate of 1  dn  s@xmath16",
    ", @xmath17 is the count rate ( in dn  s@xmath16 ) of the observed source measured for an infinite aperture , @xmath18(vega ) is the flux of a zero magnitude star with a vega - like spectrum , and @xmath19 is the magnitude of vega in all nicmos bandpasses @xcite .",
    "table  3 lists the values of @xmath15 and @xmath18(vega ) adopted for images obtained before and after the installation of the nicmos cooling system ( ncs ) in march 2002 .",
    "we computed the magnitudes of closely - separated point sources from model nic2 psfs that were generated using the tiny tim software package @xcite and then fitted to each overlapping image . to verify the fidelity of this method , we compared the four - band magnitudes of 3580 single stars obtained from fitted tiny tim psfs with those of the same stars obtained via conventional aperture photometry .",
    "the fitted f207 m and f222 m magnitudes were , on average , indistinguishable from those obtained via aperture measurements .",
    "the fitted f110w and f180 m magnitudes , however , differed from the aperture magnitudes by an average of @xmath20 and @xmath21  mag , respectively .",
    "we therefore corrected the f110w and f180 m magnitudes of closely - separated sources by subtracting these average offsets .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) deviations between the model and aperture magnitudes of our single - star sample were @xmath22  mag for f110w and only @xmath23  mag for the other filters .",
    "this consistency encouraged us to estimate the magnitudes of overexposed targets using model psfs fitted to the unsaturated parts of their images .",
    "we investigated this procedure using artificially saturated images of a well - exposed star .",
    "we found that the fitted psfs yielded progressively fainter magnitudes as the numbers of saturated pixels increased .",
    "consequently , we adjusted the model magnitudes of actual saturated images to compensate for the deficiencies noted from our simulations .",
    "these adjustments ranged from 0.01  mag for images with one saturated pixel to 0.10  mag for images saturated within one airy radius .",
    "the uncertainties of the magnitudes of overexposed stars estimated in this manner are @xmath240.25  mag .",
    "the locations of sources in the reduced images were determined from either the centroids of the photometric apertures or the pixel coordinates of the fitted model psfs .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainties of the former method are 0.1  pixel per axis , and those of the latter method are 0.2  pixel per axis for the undersampled f110w images and 0.1  pixel per axis for the other filter images .",
    "( we double these uncertainties for images affected by saturation or bad pixels . ) to determine the angular separations and position angles of the binary dwarfs , we adopted the @xmath25-axis and @xmath26-axis pixel scales for nic2 derived by the space telescope science institute around the times of our observations .",
    "we estimate that the nominal @xmath27 uncertainty in the coordinates of _ hst _ guide stars contributes a negliglible error of @xmath286 to our computed position angles .",
    "figure  [ golimowski.fig4 ] shows representative nic2 images of the five dwarfs to which we have detected new or suspected companions .",
    "the insets show magnified contour plots of the four systems separated by less than 05 .",
    "gj  1001bc , gj  54ab , and lhs  224ab are only marginally resolved .",
    "the images of lhs  224ab in all four bands are affected by bad nic2 pixels , and the f110w images of gj  54ab and gj  84a are saturated .",
    "the faint object located 174 to the southeast of gj  1001bc is an extended source , presumably a background galaxy .",
    "table  4 lists the nicmos magnitudes and relative positions of the components of the five systems , which we determined in the manners previously described .",
    "the magnitudes and colors of these dwarfs are depicted as filled circles in figures  [ golimowski.fig1]a and [ golimowski.fig1]b so that they may be readily compared with the nicmos photometry of other main - sequence stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "our nicmos snapshot program is designed to be a single - epoch , multiband survey of all stars within 10  pc .",
    "determining whether these stars and any candidate companions have common proper motion ( cpm ) technically exceeds the scope of our program .",
    "nevertheless , second - epoch observations of candidate companions may be planned at the expense of unobserved targets .",
    "only 50% of snapshot observations are likely to be executed during an _ hst _ observing cycle , however , so these second - epoch observations are not guaranteed .",
    "consequently , we sought more reliable means of confirming our candidates .",
    "we have confirmed four of the five candidate companions identified in this paper using two telescopes and three instruments , none of which are nicmos .",
    "we now describe these confirmatory observations in chronological order .",
    "the apparent separations and brightnesses of gj  54ab and lhs  224ab ( table  4 ) make them ideal targets for astrometric monitoring with _",
    "hst s _ fgs , which features white - light shearing interferometers capable of measuring the positions of close - binary systems with @xmath29  0001 precision @xcite .",
    "gj  54ab was observed with fgs1r in transfer ( trans ) mode on 2000 september  24 and 2003 june  13 .",
    "the trans scans were recorded through the wide - band f583w filter .",
    "lhs  224ab was observed with the same instrument configuration on 2000 january  7 and 2003 october  30 .",
    "the first fgs observation of lhs  224ab , which predates our nicmos observation by three years , was conducted as part of an independent fgs search for multiplicity among nearby m dwarfs and white dwarfs ( _ hst _ program 8532 ) .",
    "both binary systems continue to be monitored with fgs as parts of _ hst _ programs 9408 , 9972 , and 10104 .",
    "the complete results of these monitoring programs will be presented in subsequent papers . in the meantime , we present two - epoch results that support the duplicity of gj  54 and lhs  224 inferred from our nic2 images .    the trans - mode observations of each binary star were calibrated and processed in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ golimowski.fig5 ] shows the transfer functions of gj  54ab , lhs  224ab , and the single star hip  28355 , measured along orthogonal axes of fgs1r .",
    "these @xmath30 and @xmath31 transfer functions track the visibility of the broadband fringes as the stars are scanned across the koester s prism @xcite .",
    "the transfer functions of a single star ( left panels of figure  [ golimowski.fig5 ] ) are generally antisymmetric about the zero scan position that denotes alignment between the incoming wavefront and the optical axis .",
    "the transfer function of a binary star along a given fgs axis is the superposition of the individual stars transfer functions , offset by their projected separation along that axis .",
    "the transfer functions of lhs  224ab recorded on 2003 october  30 ( right panels of figure  [ golimowski.fig5 ] ) show that the binary star s orientation was nearly parallel to the @xmath31-axis of fgs1r and its separation was @xmath32 .",
    "likewise , the middle panels of figure  [ golimowski.fig5 ] show that , on 2003 june  13 , gj  54a and b were separated by @xmath33 and were oriented obliquely to fgs1r s @xmath30 and @xmath31 axes .",
    "decomposing the @xmath30 and @xmath31 transfer functions of gj  54ab and lhs  224ab into their constituent transfer functions allows us to determine the relative positions and f583w magnitudes of their components @xcite .",
    "table  5 lists our preliminary results .",
    "the differences between the f583w magnitudes can be transformed to johnson @xmath34-band magnitude differences ( @xmath35 ) in the manner described by @xcite . employing this technique , we estimate @xmath36 and @xmath37 for gj  54ab and lhs  224ab , respectively .",
    "these values reflect the averages of the measurements obtained along each fgs axis at two epochs of observation .",
    "their errors include those associated with the deconvolution of the transfer functions , the photometric transformations , and the published parallaxes and composite @xmath34 magnitudes of each system .      because the components of g  23925 are relatively bright and widely separated ( table  4 ) , follow - up observations of the system were possible using conventional ground - based imaging .",
    "we observed g  23925ab on 2003 may  06 using the arc 3.5  m telescope and the seaver prototype imaging camera ( spicam ) , which features a @xmath38-pixel ccd with an unbinned image scale of 0141  pix@xmath16 . exposures of 1  s , 10  s , and 60  s were recorded using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath39 filter and @xmath40 pixel binning .",
    "the 1  s image of g  23925a was unsaturated and indicated a seeing - limited image resolution of 125 .",
    "the sky transparency was variable , so no photometric calibration was possible .",
    "the images were reduced conventionally by subtracting the electronic bias and dividing by a flat - field image .",
    "figure  [ golimowski.fig6 ] shows a @xmath41 section of the the reduced 1  s image centered on g23925a .",
    "part of the star s seeing - limited psf has been subtracted to reveal g23925b more clearly .",
    "[ lacking a comparably exposed reference star , we subtracted artificial background values that were interpolated from radial profiles of the psf at azimuths @xmath42 from the position angle ( pa ) of g23925b . ]",
    "the companion is located @xmath43 from g  23925a at pa  @xmath44 .",
    "the errors in these values include a 0.5  pixel uncertainty in each coordinate of g  23925b s centroid and a possible @xmath45 error in the alignment of spicam s detector with the celestial axes ( r.  mcmillan 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "the integrated signals of each star within circular apertures of radius 085 ( 3 pixels ) indicate a magnitude difference of @xmath46 .      a follow - up observation of the gj  1001 triple system was performed on 2003 august  20 using the high resolution channel ( hrc ) of the _ hst _ acs @xcite .",

    "its @xmath50 fov allowed simultaneous imaging of all three components of the system .",
    "two sets of 2  s , 60  s , and 300  s exposures were recorded through the f850lp ( sdss @xmath39 ) filter to allow unsaturated imaging of each component . between exposures ,",
    "the telescope was offset by @xmath51 pixels along each ccd axis to diminish the possibility of image corruption by bad pixels .",
    "likewise , two sets of 2  s and 300  s exposures were recorded through the f625w ( sdss @xmath52 ) and f775w ( sdss @xmath53 ) filters .",
    "all exposures were recorded using an analog - to - digital conversion gain of @xmath54  dn@xmath16 .",
    "the digitized images were bias - subtracted and flattened using the standard acs calibration software @xcite and appropriate reference images and tables .",
    "the flattened images were then processed with the acs pipeline science investigation software ( apsis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to remove cosmic - ray contaminants , correct the images for geometric distortion , and combine the dithered pairs of images .",
    "the reduced and resampled hrc images have rectified pixel scales of 0025 along each axis .",
    "figure  [ golimowski.fig7 ] shows the resultant @xmath55  s f775w image of gj  1001abc .",
    "although gj  1001a is overexposed in this image , it is suitably exposed in our 2  s f775w images .",
    "these levels of exposure are also characteristic of the images obtained with the f625w and f850lp filters",
    ". the binary l dwarf is clearly resolved , and its photocenter lies @xmath562 from gj  1001a at pa  @xmath57 .",
    "these values are consistent with the relative positions of gj  1001a and b reported by @xcite from lower resolution , ground - based images in which gj  1001a is overexposed .",
    "although the angular resolution of the hrc at @xmath58 m is @xmath59 times better than that of nic2 at @xmath60 m , the hrc images of gj  1001b and c overlap sufficiently to preclude the use of aperture photometry . consequently , we generated model psfs for each component using tiny tim @xcite and a reference spectrum of the l4 dwarf 2mass  j03454316 + 2540233 @xcite . because tiny tim produces only geometrically distorted psfs , we fitted model psfs to the flattened but distorted ( i.e. , pre - apsis ) images of gj  1001b and c. tiny tim does not fully simulate the diffuse halo of scattered light that is superposed on point - source images longward of @xmath61 m @xcite , so we derived approximate corrections for this effect in the f775w and f850lp bandpasses for each dwarf .",
    "in doing so , we normalized the integrated pixel values from the psfs fitted to the images of gj  1001a with those obtained directly from the apsis - processed images using circular apertures with radii of 05 and the aperture corrections for m dwarfs reported by @xcite .",
    "we then applied the same normalization to the psfs fitted to the images of gj  1001b and c along with additional corrections of @xmath62 and @xmath63 to compensate for the spectral differences between gj  1001a and gj  1001bc @xcite .",
    "we also applied small ( @xmath64% ) corrections for photometric losses caused by ccd charge - transfer inefficiency @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainties of these corrected count rates are @xmath18% .",
    "we converted the count rates to ab and vega - based magnitudes using the photometric calibration recipe of @xcite , which specifies that vega has zero magnitude in all bandpasses .",
    "table  6 lists the resulting magnitudes and errors of gj  1001abc in each bandpass .    to determine the relative separations and orientations of the system components , we transformed the pixel coordinates of the fitted psfs ( which are measured from the geometrically distorted images ) to angular coordinates measured along the v2 and v3 axes that define _ hst s _ principal focal plane . in doing so",
    ", we used the latest image - distortion correction table ( idctab ) for the hrc , which has an rms residual error of 0.030.05  pixels per axis for the filters used in our study @xcite .",
    "the errors in the measured centroids of our fitted psfs are @xmath65  pixel , and the uncertainty in the orientation of the hrc fov due to the @xmath66 inaccuracy of _ hst _ guide star coordinates is @xmath677 .",
    "columns 68 of table  6 list the apparent and projected separations and position angles of the gj  1001 system , based on the average measurements from individual hrc images and the parallax given in table  1 .",
    "the first set of values pertains to the separation and orientation of the photocenter of gj  1001bc with respect to gj  1001a .",
    "the second set of values pertains to components b and c separately .",
    "the psf - subtracted nic2 images of each dwarf reveal no sources other than the five companions and the single galaxy in the field of gj  1001bc .",
    "the paucity of background sources is not suprising given the generally high galactic latitudes of the dwarfs ( col .",
    "4 of table  1 ) and nic2 s small fov .",
    "thus , the dwarfs high latitudes raise the likelihood that any apparent companions are true companions .",
    "indeed , the high latitudes of these dwarfs prompted their inclusion in this paper announcing the first confirmed companions of our nicmos survey .",
    "we now discuss the evidence confirming these companions and the implications for our future understanding of vlm multiple systems .",
    "we begin with gj  1001bc , which is arguably the most significant of the newfound binaries from the perspective of constraining the mlr in the substellar regime .      assuming that gj  1001c is always the fainter of the close - binary components seen in our nic2 and hrc images , then gj  1001c moved @xmath68 at pa  @xmath69 relative to gj  1001b during the 313 days between our epochs of observation .",
    "this motion is much less than that expected from the annual proper motion of the gj  1001 system ( 1618 at pa  @xmath70 ; @xcite ) . however , the nic2 magnitudes of gj  1001b and c differ by amounts similar to their combined uncertainties , so their identities at each epoch are somewhat ambiguous .",
    "if we switch their identities in the nic2 images , then gj  1001c moved @xmath32 at pa  @xmath71 relative to gj  1001b between our nicmos and acs observations .",
    "this motion is also much smaller and differently oriented than the annual proper motion of the gj  1001 system .",
    "conversely , the photocenter of gj  1001bc moved 141 at pa  @xmath72 relative to the galaxy labeled in figure  [ golimowski.fig7 ] , which is consistent with the annual proper motion .",
    "we therefore conclude that gj  1001a , b , and c have cpm regardless of how the components are labeled , and that the relative motion of gj  1001b and c is orbital in nature .    using the observed separations of gj  1001bc , a distance to the triple system of @xmath73  pc @xcite , and the statistical relation between the observed angular separation ( @xmath74 ) and the semimajor axis of the relative orbit ( @xmath75 ) ,      @xcite",

    "the age of gj  1001a is loosely constrained to 110  gyr @xcite , so we infer from evolutionary models @xcite that its coeval l4.5 dwarf companions have masses of 0.060.075  @xmath78 .",
    "if so , then the period of gj  1001bc s orbit is @xmath79  yr , which is the shortest estimated period of any known binary l or t dwarf ( table  7 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath80 ( clockwise ) difference between the position angles of gj  1001c in the nic2 and hrc images suggests either that the orbital period is actually much longer than 3  yr , or that gj  1001b and c are not consistently identified in the nic2 and hrc images .",
    "if the identities of gj  1001b and c in the nic2 images are switched , then gj  1001c s position angle changed by @xmath81 ( anticlockwise ) , which is more compatible with a @xmath82  yr period than the motion inferred from our adopted designations of gj  1001b and c.    since its discovery in 1999 , gj  1001b has been well studied photometrically and spectroscopically @xcite . as a companion to an m dwarf of known distance",
    ", it has frequently been used to study the relationships between the luminosities , colors , and spectral types of l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "none of these studies describes gj  1001b as overluminous for its color or spectral type , as would be expected for a non - eclipsed binary system with components of equal luminosity .",
    "the fact that gj  1001bc is binary indicates that either its components are underluminous or its inferred trigonometric parallax is incorrect .",
    "the composite optical and near - infrared spectra of gj  1001bc show that the components are typical mid - l dwarfs and reveal no cause for underluminosity in any optical or near - infrared bandpass . applying the sdss color  magnitude relation of @xcite to our acs photometry of each component ( table  6 ) , we compute an average photometric parallax of @xmath83 , or a distance to gj  1001bc of @xmath84  pc . similarly applying the spectroscopic parallax relations of @xcite for l4.5 dwarfs , we obtain distance moduli of @xmath85@xmath86 to @xmath87 , or @xmath8814  pc . although these estimated photometric and spectroscopic distances agree only marginally , both suggest that the only published trigonometric parallax of gj  1001a @xcite is too large . indeed",
    ", preliminary astrometric results for gj  1001a from the cerro tololo parallax investigation indicate that the star s distance is closer to 15  pc than to 10  pc ( t.  henry et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "assuming a revised distance of @xmath89  pc to gj  1001bc , we estimate that its relative orbit has a semimajor axis of @xmath90  au and a period of @xmath91  yr .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties associated with these estimates prevent us from identifying gj  1001b and c in the nic2 images unambiguously .",
    "regardless of the components designations , gj  1001bc offers a superb opportunity to determine the orbit and dynamical masses of two probable brown dwarfs in a small amount of time .",
    "our hrc images show that _ hst _ can provide the high - resolution images necessary for such pioneering measurements , if its lifetime is extended by a fifth servicing mission .",
    "gj  1001bc s faintness and small separation pose a challenge for ground - based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics ( ao ) , but the image resolution achieved during recent ao observations of the binary t dwarfs @xmath92  indi  bc @xcite indicate that long - term monitoring of gj  1001bc s orbit should be possible with the latest ground - based imaging technology .",
    "the suspected duplicity of gj  54 was first reported by @xcite , who visually observed a `` very close double star of nearly equal components in the 40-inch reflector '' at siding spring observatory .",
    "they provided no information about the separation of the double star or the epoch of their observation , but the lack of other stars of comparable brightness within several arcminutes of gj  54 suggests that @xcite did observe the same pair of stars seen in our nic2 images .",
    "the @xmath34-band diffraction limit of a 40-inch telescope is comparable to the separation of gj  54ab measured from our nic2 and fgs data , so @xcite may have seen the pair during instances of excellent atmospheric seeing . therefore , we credit @xcite with the initial discovery of gj  54ab , and reserve for ourselves the pleasure of confirming and quantifying that discovery .",
    "the fgs trans scans of gj  54 recorded on 2000 september  24 and 2003 june  13 ( figure  [ golimowski.fig5 ] ) show two components separated by @xmath93 ( table  5 ) .",
    "this separation is similar to that measured from our nic2 images obtained on 1998 november  9 , and it is much less than gj  54 s annual proper motion of @xmath94 @xcite . we therefore conclude that gj  54a and b exhibit cpm and are physically bound .",
    "figures  [ golimowski.fig1]a and [ golimowski.fig1]b show that the nic2 magnitudes and colors of gj  54a and b are consistent with other stars in our 10  pc sample having spectral types m2.0m2.5 and m3.0 , respectively .",
    "using our computed value of @xmath35 for gj  54ab (  2.2.1 ) and published measurements of the stars composite @xmath34 magnitude and parallax ( table  1 ) , we obtain @xmath95 and @xmath96 for gj  54a and b , respectively . employing the @xmath34-band mlr of @xcite",
    ", we compute masses of @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the two stars .    using our _ hst _ measurements ,",
    "a distance to gj  54ab of @xmath99  pc ( table  1 ) , and equation  ( 2 ) , we estimate a semimajor axis of @xmath100  au and a period of @xmath101  yr for gj  54ab s relative orbit .",
    "after deconvolving the individual components of the fgs transfer functions and transforming them to celestial positions , we find that the position of gj  54b relative to gj  54a on 2000 september  24 was nearly coincident with the position observed in the nic2 images recorded 1.87  yr before .",
    "in fact , a preliminary fit of a keplerian orbit to our three - epoch astrometric measurements yields a highly inclined orbit with a semimajor axis of @xmath102 ( @xmath103  au ) , a period of @xmath104  yr , and masses of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , our crude photometric and astrometric estimates of the orbits and masses of gj  54ab are mutually consistent .",
    "@xcite reported 11 radial - velocity measurements of gj  84 obtained at the 10  m keck  i observatory from 1998 february to 2001 july that indicate the presence of a low - mass companion .",
    "they reproduced the velocity variations by fitting a partial keplerian orbit with a period of @xmath107  yr , a semiamplitude of @xmath108  km  s@xmath16 , and an eccentricity of @xmath109 .",
    "they also estimated for the companion a minimum mass of @xmath110 and a minimum semimajor axis of 5.6  au .",
    "these values are consistent with the luminosity and projected separation of the faint companion seen in our nic2 images ( table  4 ) .",
    "our images thus confirm the duplicity of gj  84 , and are useful for further constraining the parameters of the binary orbit .",
    "figure  [ golimowski.fig1]b shows that the values of @xmath111 and f110w  f222 m  @xmath112 measured for gj  84b lie between those of the m7 dwarf gj  105c ( @xmath113 , f110w ",
    "f222 m  @xmath114 ; revised from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the m8 dwarf gj  752b ( @xmath115 , f110w ",
    "f222m@xmath116 ) .",
    "the anomalous location of gj  84b s colors in figure  [ golimowski.fig1]a is likely due to a singularly large error in our f180 m measurement caused by the coincidence of gj  84b s image and a diffraction spike from gj  84a ( figures  [ golimowski.fig2 ] and [ golimowski.fig3 ] ) .",
    "as the magnitudes and colors of gj  84b generally match those of gj  105c within their combined uncertainties , we tentatively assign a spectral type of m7 to gj  84b . to estimate the masses of gj  84a and b from current near - infrared mlrs",
    ", we loosely equate our measured values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 for each star with its conventional @xmath119- and @xmath120-band absolute magnitude , respectively . employing the mlrs of @xcite",
    ", we obtain masses of @xmath121 and @xmath122 for gj  84a and b , respectively .",
    "using these masses , a distance to gj  84ab of @xmath123  pc ( table  1 ) , the observed binary separation ( table  4 ) , and equation  ( 2 ) , we estimate a semimajor axis of @xmath124  au and a period of @xmath125  yr for gj  84ab s relative orbit .    we can investigate the consistency between the orbital characteristics estimated from our nic2 images and those derived by @xcite from the keplerian fit to their measured radial velocities .",
    "kepler s third law may be expressed as      @xcite , where @xmath127 is the semimajor axis of the primary star s orbit about the barycenter in units of arcsec , @xmath128 is the absolute parallax , @xmath129 is the orbital period expressed in years , and @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the primary and secondary masses in units of @xmath78 . using our estimated masses of gj  84a and b and the fitted radial - velocity period of @xcite , we obtain @xmath132 .",
    "an equation relating orbital parameters derived astrometrically and spectroscopically @xcite can be expressed as      where @xmath53 is the inclination of the orbit with respect to the line of sight , @xmath134 is the semiamplitude of the primary star s radial - velocity orbit in units of km  s@xmath16 , @xmath135 is the eccentricity of the orbit , and @xmath136 . inserting the values of @xmath127 , @xmath129 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 derived by @xcite and us ,",
    "we obtain @xmath137 .",
    "only the values of @xmath138 deviating by more than @xmath139 from 1.49 are physical , which indicates that the keplerian fit to the radial velocity data is only marginally compatible with our observed luminosities ( masses ) of gj  84ab .",
    "clearly , more spectroscopic and astrometric observations are needed over the next decade to better constrain the orbit of gj  84ab .",
    "the duplicity of lhs  224 was first suspected by @xcite , who noted a possible astrometric perturbation with a period of @xmath140  yr from photographic plates produced by the united states naval observatory from 1969 to 1980 .",
    "after another decade of astrometric monitoring , @xcite could neither confirm nor deny this suspicion . in 1999 , lhs  224 was included in our ongoing fgs survey of nearby and possibly binary red and white dwarfs .",
    "the trans scans of lhs  224 recorded on 2000 january  7 and 2003 october  30 ( figure  [ golimowski.fig5 ] ) show two components separated by @xmath32 ( table  5 ) .",
    "this separation is similar to that measured from our nic2 images obtained on 2003 march  13 , and it is much less than lhs  224 s annual proper motion of @xmath141 @xcite . we therefore conclude that lhs  224a and b exhibit cpm and are physically bound .    figures  [ golimowski.fig1]a and [ golimowski.fig1]b suggest that the nic2 f110w magnitudes and f110w  f222 m colors of lhs  224ab are brighter and bluer , respectively , than those of other m5 dwarfs . such anomalous behavior is not seen in other color  magnitude and color  color diagrams constructed from our f180 m , f207 m , and f222 m photometry of nearby stars .",
    "we therefore suspect that our f110w measurements are adversely affected by the undersampled f110w images of lhs  224ab and by the unfortunate proximity of bad pixels to those images ( figure  [ golimowski.fig4 ] ) .",
    "the magnitudes and colors of lhs  224a and b measured in the other bandpasses are consistent with those of several nearby dwarfs having types m4.5m5.0 and m5.0m5.5 , respectively .",
    "using our computed value of @xmath35 for lhs  224ab (  2.2.1 ) and published measurements of the stars composite @xmath34 magnitude and parallax ( table  1 ) , we obtain @xmath142 and @xmath143 for lhs  224a and b , respectively . employing the @xmath34-band mlr of @xcite , we compute masses of @xmath144 and @xmath145 for the two stars .    using our nic2 measurements , a distance to lhs  224ab of @xmath146  pc @xcite , and equation  ( 2 )",
    ", we estimate @xmath147  au and @xmath148  yr for lhs  224ab s orbit .",
    "a preliminary fit of a keplerian orbit to our three - epoch astrometric measurements yields @xmath149  au , @xmath150  yr , and masses of @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "these dynamic masses exceed our photometric estimates by @xmath153 , but we expect these discrepancies to diminish greatly as more fgs measurements are obtained over a broader range of orbital phases .      during the 4.5 years between our nic2 and spicam observations , g  23925a s proper motion was 142 toward pa  @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "the magnitude and direction of this motion are inconsistent with the small differences between the relative positions of g  23925a and b at each epoch .",
    "we therefore conclude that g  23925a and b have cpm and are gravitationally bound .",
    "moreover , we believe that the observed motion of g  23925b relative to g  23925a ( @xmath155 toward pa  @xmath156 ) is orbital in nature .    figures  [ golimowski.fig1]a and [ golimowski.fig1]b show that the nic2 magnitudes and colors of g  23925b are similar to those of the m8 dwarf gj  752b and the spectroscopically unclassified late - m dwarf gj  1245c .",
    "the latter dwarf is the least massive m dwarf ( @xmath157 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for which a mass has been computed exclusively from dynamical elements . for the two dwarfs .",
    "lacking a dynamical measurement of the components mass ratio , they inferred a value of 0.89 from their relative near - infrared photometry of the pair . ]",
    "we assume for our present purpose that g  23925b has the same spectral type and mass as gj  752b and gj  1245c , respectively . liberally applying our f110w , f207 m , and f222 m photometry of g  23925a to the near - infrared mlrs of @xcite  ( 2000 ;",
    "see  3.3 of this paper ) , we estimate a mass of @xmath158 for the m3 dwarf . using these masses , a distance to g  23925ab of @xmath159  pc @xcite , the observed binary separations ( table  4 and  2.2.2 ) , and equation  ( 2 ) , we estimate @xmath160  au and @xmath161  yr for g  23925ab s orbit .",
    "if our estimates of the physical and dynamical characteristics of g  23925ab are correct , then g  23925a s radial velocity should vary periodically with an amplitude of @xmath82  km  s@xmath16 .",
    "@xcite reported that the radial velocity of g  23925a ( hip  71898 ) was stable to within 0.1  km  s@xmath16 of 18.704  km  s@xmath16 over 864 days distributed about a mean calendar date of 1999 january  5 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite reported that the star s radial velocity increased from 17.51 to 21.17  km  s@xmath16 ( with an average uncertainty of @xmath162  km  s@xmath16 ) over 68 days in mid-1994 .",
    "this trend is hard to explain in the face of the more precise measurements of @xcite and our estimated period of @xmath163  yr .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ and tycho catalogues note that the large error associated with the g  23925a s parallax ( table  1 ) is consistent with the effects of a short - period astrometric binary @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent reanalysis of the _ hipparcos _ measurements yielded a `` more likely '' single - star parallax solution of @xmath164  mas @xcite .",
    "thus , the results of @xcite are probably not caused by unresolved duplicity .",
    "the companions described in this paper increase the number of known binary systems within 10  pc by 8% and the number of known systems within 10  pc having three or more components by 6% ( t.  henry et al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ". these new and confirmed systems can be grouped in several ways :    * orbital periods @xmath165  yr ( gj  1001bc , gj  54ab , and lhs  224ab ) * component masses @xmath166 ( gj  1001bc , gj  84b , lhs  224ab , and g  23925b ) * secondary / primary mass ratios @xmath167 ( gj  84ab and g  23925ab ) * secondary / primary mass ratios @xmath168 ( gj  1001bc , gj  54ab , and lhs  224ab )    astrometrically monitoring the first group will quickly yield dynamic masses needed to constrain the mlr at well - spaced intervals between 0.50 and @xmath169 . monitoring the second group will extend the presently known mlr beyond its lower limit of @xmath170 , where the effects of varying metallicity and age are pronounced @xcite . as members of the first two groups , gj  1001bc and lhs  224ab merit immediate and comprehensive follow - up study .",
    "indeed , gj  1001bc offers one of the best opportunities to date for determining empirically the masses of binary brown dwarfs . for the l0+l1.5 binary 2mass  j07464256 + 2000321ab from its relative orbit . using photometric and astrometric data and theoretical evolutionary tracks , they estimated masses of @xmath171 and @xmath172 for the l0 and l1.5 dwarfs , respectively . ] gj  84ab provides an opportunity for determining the mass of an m dwarf near the hydrogen - burning limit , but the system s comparatively long period ( @xmath89  yr ) requires a greater commitment of resources and patience than is needed for monitoring gj  1001bc , gj  54ab , and lhs  224ab .",
    "unfortunately , an accurate measurement of the mass of the candidate brown dwarf g  23925b probably will not be obtained within the lifetimes of current generations of astronomers .    comparing the masses of gj  1001bc with those of other short - period binary brown dwarfs having different spectral types ( table  7 ) will be the first steps toward empirically mapping the cooling tracks of brown dwarfs with various masses .",
    "moreover , by assuming that gj  1001bc and other suspected substellar members of close - multiple systems [ such as gj  1245c @xcite , the m8.5m9.5 dwarfs lhs  1070bc @xcite and gj  569bc @xcite , the l dwarfs gj  417bc @xcite and gj  564bc @xcite , and the t dwarfs @xmath92  indi  bc @xcite ] are coeval with their primary stellar companions , constraints can be placed on the often cited  but empirically untested  evolutionary models of brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the estimated mass ratios of the four binary m dwarfs are evenly distributed into low ( @xmath167 ) and high ( @xmath168 ) bins .",
    "we can hardly draw statistical inferences from such a small sample , but it is interesting that the first identifications of binary m dwarfs from our nicmos survey have a bimodal distribution of mass ratios .",
    "such a distribution defies the noted tendency for binary m dwarfs to have components of approximately equal mass @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the nearly identical components of gj  1001bc conform to the strong trend toward equal masses observed among binary l and t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we defer to a later paper a complete discussion of the systemic statistics ( i.e. , multiplicity fraction , secondary luminosity function , and distribution of mass ratios ) of the recons `` 10  pc sample '' once our nicmos survey is complete and fully analyzed .",
    "the authors thank kuenley chiu and wei zheng for obtaining the spicam images of g23925ab on our behalf .",
