    "observations indicate that roughly 70% of the total energy density in the universe is in the form of dark energy , which has negative pressure and drives the late - time acceleration of the universe ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review , and references therein ) .",
    "the simplest model for this dark energy is a cosmological constant , but many other alternatives have been put forward .",
    "one possibility , dubbed quintessence , is a model in which the dark energy arises from a scalar field @xcite . in another class of models ,",
    "the dark energy is simply taken to be barotropic fluid , in which the pressure @xmath6 and energy density @xmath7 are related by @xmath8 the prototype for this sort of model is the chaplygin gas @xcite , which can be considered a special case of the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite . although originally proposed as unified models for dark matter and dark energy , the chaplygin gas and generalized chaplygin gas models have also been examined as models for dark energy alone @xcite .",
    "interest in barotropic fluids as dark energy has not been confined to the generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "many other models have been proposed , including , e.g. , the van der waals model @xcite and the wet dark fluid model @xcite .    obviously , it is important to determine whether these models can be distinguished by their observational consequences . in this vein , caldwell and linder @xcite examined the behavior of quintessence models in the plane defined by the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the dark energy . here",
    "@xmath0 is the ratio of pressure to density for the dark energy : @xmath9 and @xmath1 is the derivative of @xmath0 with respect to the logarithm of the scale factor @xmath10 : @xmath11 caldwell and linder showed that quintessence models in which the scalar field potential asymptotically approaches zero can be divided naturally into two categories , which they dubbed  freezing \" and  thawing \" models , with quite different behavior in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "here we extend and generalize these results . in the next section",
    ", we determine the behavior of general non - phantom barotropic fluids with positive squared sound speed in the @xmath4 plane , and we show that these models occupy a region of phase space which is disjoint from that occupied by quintessence models . in section 3 , we re - examine the lower bound on @xmath1 from ref .",
    "@xcite ; we derive a new bound for a more general class of quintessence models , and sharpen the bound from ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of tracker potentials .",
    "these results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "our results support the argument that the behavior of dark energy models in the @xmath4 plane provides a useful discriminator for such models .",
    "as noted in the previous section , a barotropic fluid is one for which the pressure is purely a function of the density , @xmath13 . for such models",
    ", we have @xmath14 the factors in this equation are given by @xmath15 and @xmath16    then the expression for @xmath1 becomes @xmath17 in order to derive useful constraints from equation ( [ baro ] ) , we need to assume something about the behavior of @xmath18 and @xmath0 .",
    "we will assume first that we are not dealing with phantom models , so that @xmath19 .",
    "second , we note that @xmath20 , and we will assume further that @xmath21 , to avoid instabilities in perturbation growth .",
    "these constraints are satisfied by most barotropic fluids of interest , although it is also possible to construct models which violate both assumptions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with these assumptions , equation ( [ baro ] )",
    "gives the limit @xmath22 this limit is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where have used the same scale as ref . @xcite for easy comparison .",
    "= 3truein    note that this is the exact opposite of the limit derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for  freezing \" quintessence models : @xmath23 thus , barotropic fluids and freezing quintessence models occupy non - overlapping regions in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "the bound in equation ( [ barobound ] ) is saturated when @xmath24 , which corresponds to the case @xmath25 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath26",
    ". models of this kind are particularly interesting , since they correspond to a barotropic fluid that behaves exactly like a mixture of dark matter ( dust ) and a cosmological constant . such models can be constructed in the context of either the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite or @xmath27-essence @xcite .",
    "now consider several illustrative special cases .",
    "for the generalized chaplygin gas , the equation of state is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constants .",
    "( the chaplygin gas corresponds to the special case @xmath31 ) .",
    "then it is straightforward to use equation ( [ baro ] ) to derive @xmath32 this behavior is displayed in fig . 1 for several values of @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath33 case saturates the upper bound on @xmath1 , as it corresponds to the previously - noted @xmath25 model , while the original chaplygin gas model ( @xmath34 ) gives @xmath35 .",
    "another barotropic model is the wet dark fluid model of ref .",
    "@xcite , with equation of state @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are constants .",
    "again , it is straightforward to use equation ( [ baro ] ) to derive the result @xmath39 which is displayed in fig . 1 for several values of @xmath37 .",
    "while we have assumed that the fluid characterized by @xmath1 and @xmath0 acts strictly as dark energy , all of the results derived here can also be applied to unified dark energy models , in which the barotropic fluid serves as both dark matter and dark energy ( indeed , this is one of the main motivations for the chaplygin gas model and its variants ) .",
    "however , in the case of unified dark energy , @xmath0 and @xmath1 refer to the entire fluid , not just to the dark energy component .",
    "the equation of motion for the quintessence field @xmath40 is @xmath41 where the hubble parameter @xmath42 is @xmath43 and @xmath7 is the total density .",
    "( we assume an @xmath44 universe and take @xmath45 throughout ) . since we are interested in the late - time evolution of the dark energy , we assume that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the density of the matter , scaling as @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the scalar field energy density , given by @xmath50 the pressure of the scalar field is @xmath51    caldwell and linder @xcite examined models in which @xmath40 evolves toward the state @xmath52 .",
    "they distinguished two cases :  thawing \" models , in which @xmath53 initially , but @xmath0 increases as @xmath40 rolls down the potential , and  freezing \" models , in which @xmath54 initially , but @xmath0 approaches @xmath55 as the field rolls down the potential .",
    "the bounds derived in ref .",
    "@xcite are based on a combination of plausibility arguments and numerical simulations . for the  thawing \" models , these limits are @xmath56 while for the  freezing \" models , @xmath57    as noted in the previous section , the allowed region for barotropic fluids in the @xmath4 plane lies adjacent to the lower bound on @xmath1 for quintessence models proposed in ref .",
    "therefore , it is the lower bound in equation ( [ freeze ] ) which is of greatest interest here .",
    "we first generalize the caldwell - linder lower bound to a wider range of potentials .",
    "consider a scalar field evolving in an arbitrary monotonic potential @xmath58 , not necessarily asymptotically zero .",
    "we will take @xmath59 , but of course the argument is identical in the opposite case .",
    "now , following steinhardt et al .",
    "@xcite , we note that the equation of motion for @xmath40 can be rewritten as @xmath60,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is defined as @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the derivative of @xmath61 with respect to @xmath64 , so that @xmath63 and @xmath1 are related via @xmath65    now we note that for a scalar field rolling downhill in a monotonically decreasing potential , the left - hand side of equation ( [ motion1 ] ) is always positive .",
    "this , in turn , implies that @xmath66 , which translates into the following bound on @xmath1 : @xmath67 while not as tight as the caldwell - linder bound , equation ( [ bound1 ] ) applies to a more general class of models ; it assumes nothing about tracking behavior or  freezing \" of the scalar field , nor is it confined to potentials for which @xmath68 asymptotically .",
    "this bound is saturated by a scalar field rolling on the constant potential @xmath69 . for this case",
    ", @xmath0 evolves from @xmath70 to @xmath53 , with @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the bound in equation ( [ bound1 ] ) , along with the lower bound on @xmath1 from ref .",
    "@xcite , are shown in fig .",
    "= 3truein    we can tighten this bound considerably for the case of  tracker \" models , i.e. , models for which @xmath0 is initially constant when @xmath72 , but which evolve toward @xmath73 when @xmath74 .",
    "again , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define @xmath75 to be given by @xmath76 if @xmath77 is the equation of state parameter for the background fluid , then tracking behavior with @xmath78 occurs when @xmath75 is roughly constant with @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath75 is exactly constant for power law and exponential potentials .",
    "in particular , for the potential @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 .",
    "taking the derivative of equation ( [ motion1 ] ) with respect to @xmath40 gives @xmath82 note that this equation differs from the corresponding equation in ref .",
    "@xcite because we do not take the limit @xmath83 ; all of the interesting evolution occurs when @xmath49 becomes significant compared to @xmath47 .",
    "it does however , agree with the expression previously derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in the limit where @xmath84 , equation ( [ motion2 ] ) reduces to the corresponding equation in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the tracker solution is reached , and the background fluid dominates , @xmath0 is a constant",
    ". we will be interested in the late - time evolution of the quintessence field , so we assume that the background fluid is cold dark matter , with @xmath85 .",
    "then for the tracker solution , taking @xmath86 and @xmath87 in equation ( [ motion2 ] ) gives @xmath88 in this regime , @xmath89 increases with time ; when @xmath89 is no longer negligible with respect to @xmath90 , the tracker solution no longer applies . at this point",
    ", @xmath0 decreases , asymptotically approaching @xmath73 .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the evolution in this regime ) .",
    "since @xmath91 for these tracker solutions , we have @xmath92 .",
    "initially , @xmath93 , but as @xmath89 becomes nonnegligible , @xmath63 decreases .",
    "it reaches some minimum value , @xmath94 , but then increases back to a value near zero as @xmath95 .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , in which we show the evolution for @xmath63 as a function of @xmath89 for several power - law potentials .",
    "= 3truein    the value of @xmath94 is the key to our calculation , since it gives a lower bound on @xmath1 through equation ( [ xprime ] ) .    to find this minimum value for @xmath63",
    ", we simply take @xmath96 in equation ( [ motion2 ] ) , where we assume also that @xmath97 and that @xmath75 is nearly constant .",
    "this gives @xmath98 on the right - hand side of this equation , @xmath0 , @xmath89 , and @xmath75 are to be evaluated at the point at which @xmath99 .",
    "in general @xmath89 and @xmath0 evolve in a complex fashion ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so equation ( [ xmin ] ) does not have a simple solution . however , since we seek a lower bound on @xmath63 , it is sufficient to use equation ( [ xmin ] ) to find a lower bound on @xmath94 .",
    "we first note that @xmath100 ; applying this limit ( with @xmath101 ) to equation ( [ xmin ] ) yields @xmath102 the right - hand side of equation ( [ xmin2 ] ) increases with decreasing @xmath0 , so a lower bound on the right - hand side is achieved by assigning the maximum allowed value to @xmath0 . in tracker models , @xmath0 decreases from the initial value given by equation ( [ wtrack ] ) , so substituting the value for @xmath0 given by equation ( [ wtrack ] ) into equation ( [ xmin2 ] ) gives a lower bound on @xmath94 : @xmath103 taking @xmath104 , and using equation ( [ xprime ] ) to convert from @xmath63 to @xmath1 , we obtain the limit @xmath105 this is obviously a model - dependent result , since it depends on the value of @xmath75 for which tracking behavior is achieved",
    ". however , we can use it to derive a more general limit by noting that , since @xmath106 , we have @xmath107 < 1 $ ] , giving @xmath108 equation ( [ wprime2 ] ) gives a lower bound on @xmath1 for tracker models .",
    "this bound is shown in fig .",
    "this is clearly a very conservative limit ; for example , it is obvious from fig .",
    "3 that the value of @xmath94 is often obtained for a value of @xmath89 larger than is consistent with observations . however , equation ( [ wprime2 ] ) does give a tighter bound than that derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , further separating quintessence models from the barotropic fluid models discussed in the previous section .",
    "our results illustrate the usefulness of the @xmath4 plane as a means for observationally distinguishing dark energy models",
    ". non - phantom barotropic fluid models with positive squared sound speed and  tracker \" quintessence models occupy disjoint regions in this plane . even our less stringent general limit on quintessence models with monotonic potentials is inconsistent with a wide class of barotropic fluid models , as can be seen by comparing figs . 1 and 2 .    supernova ia measurements @xcite have narrowed the range of possible values for @xmath0 ; in particular , they are consistent with @xmath53 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is less well constrained ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that the resolution on a measurement of @xmath1 must be of order @xmath109 in order to distinguish  freezing \" and  thawing \" quintessence models .",
    "we reach a similar conclusion with regard to barotropic fluids and quintessence models : observationally distinguishing between these two classes of models also requires that @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we note that there is a relation between the @xmath4 parametrization of ref . @xcite and the  statefinder \" pair introduced in ref .",
    "the statefinders @xmath110 and @xmath111 are defined by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "then @xmath110 and @xmath111 are related to @xmath0 and @xmath1 via @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the fraction of the total energy density contributed by the dark energy .",
    "note , however , that the mapping between @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath110 , @xmath111 is non - trivial because of the factor of @xmath115 in equation ( [ r ] ) . for non - constant @xmath0 , the evolution of @xmath115 depends in a complicated way on both @xmath10 and @xmath116 .",
    "hence , the statefinder parameters encode somewhat different information about the behavior of the dark energy than do @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the statefinder parameters are more directly related to observable quantities , while the @xmath3 parametrization describes more directly the physical properties of the dark energy .",
