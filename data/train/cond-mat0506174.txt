    "the differential conductance measurements are made in the presence of a finite applied bias voltage @xmath2 , which is a situation for which there are few theoretical predictions .",
    "there are calculations based on the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) @xcite .",

    "this approach should reliably describe the trends in the approach to the strong correlation limit , as the interaction strength is increased , but can not fully describe the kondo regime , where there is an exponential renormalization of the kondo resonance width as a function of @xmath0 .",

    "more accurate methods @xcite for the kondo regime exist for calculations in an applied magnetic field , which have been used to interpret the experimental results @xcite , but they are restricted to the linear response ( equilibrium ) regime . it is not clear that using the equilibrium response for @xmath1 in the presence of an applied bias voltage will lead to reliable predictions . in this paper",
    "we examine the effect of a finite applied bias voltage in the small bias regime . in the limit of a small magnetic field @xmath7",

    "the hybridization weighted density of states , @xmath15 , can be taken as a constant @xmath16 .",
    "taking this limit justifies the neglect of any magnetic field term acting on the conduction electrons in ( [ ham ] ) ( clogston - anderson compensation theorem @xcite ) .",
    "any polarization of the conduction electrons only affects the impurity via the hybridization function @xmath17 and any change to the conduction band density of states due to an applied magnetic field is only at the band edges ( @xmath18 ) , and hence negligible if @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath17 is independent of @xmath20 the magnetic field does not need to be included in the electron band .",
    "the single impurity model can be applied to a quantum dot which is equally coupled via leads to left and right reservoirs . in this situation",
    "the charge on the quantum dot is coupled only to an even combination of states from the left and right channels by an effective hybridization @xmath21 , so it can be mapped into a single channel model .",

    "it is not clear that this will constitute a reasonable approximation at the finite bias voltages used in the experiment . to examine this question",
    "we have derived an expression for the differential conductivity through a quantum dot , described by a symmetric anderson model , for small bias voltages and arbitrary magnetic field .",
    "this has enabled us to estimate the effect of the voltage dependent terms from the non - equilibrium dot green s function .",
    "our estimates of the shifts of the component resonances for small magnetic field values differ significantly from the values obtained using the equilibrium green s function .",
    "we conclude that it is important to take this voltage dependence into account and use the non - equilibrium green s function for a meaningful comparison with experiment .",
    "though our calculations are restricted to the small voltage regime we have also been able to estimate the value of the critical field @xmath8 for the emergence of two distinct peaks in the total differential conductance .",
    "our approach is applicable in all ranges of the interaction @xmath0 from the weak coupling to the strong coupling kondo regime for @xmath75 .",
    "they complement the perturbation calculations in @xmath0 of fuji and ueda @xcite for the same model .",
    "it is difficult to make a comparison with their results , however , because the interaction simultaneously modifies the renormalized parameters , such as @xmath59 , and introduces a dependence on @xmath2 , both directly and through the @xmath20 dependence in the self - energy .",
    "these three effects of the interaction can be clearly distinguished within our formulation and taken separately into account .",
    "it should be possible to extend our calculations to larger values of @xmath2 using a renormalized version of the perturbation theory , and this approach is currently being investigated .",
