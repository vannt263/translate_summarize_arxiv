    "the figure shows two regimes : below 10  ev , low - fip elements have about the same abundances and are close to the solar photospheric values . above 10  ev",
    ", the abundance ratios increase with increasing fip , as observed in several other rs cvn binaries @xcite .",
    "figure  11 of @xcite shows a similar pattern , although these authors preferred to interpret it as an absence of fip - dependent pattern .",

    "it shows that abundance ratios are very similar for the three sets . on the other hand ,",
    "the absolute abundances are systematically higher in our fits than those by @xcite by a factor of about 1.5 .",
    "although two different observations ( e.g. , at two different epochs ) could , in principle , yield different abundances because the dominant x - ray emitting regions are not the same and the observed , average , coronal composition could be different , it is far more probable that different analysis techniques could lead to different best - fit abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the spectral inversion problem being an ill - posed problem , small statistical variations can lead to discrepant results via the dem inversion @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , difficult to estimate which set of abundances is preferred . on the other hand , it is worthwhile to stress the robustness of abundance ratios which show ( whatever the technique and the data set ) that a complex fip - dependent abundance pattern is present in @xmath0 crb s corona .",
    "the use of a solar photospheric set of abundances to compare with stellar coronal abundances is naturally problematic , since stars can have a photospheric composition at variance from the sun s .",
    "magnetically active stars are difficult objects to derive accurate surface abundances in view of their rapid rotation and surface spots .",
    "@xcite have , however , obtained estimates of the photospheric abundances of the low - fip elements fe and ca , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( with the usual @xmath24 notation ; they estimate an uncertainty of @xmath25  dex ) .",

    "in contrast , @xcite obtain a slightly depleted coronal fe abundance .",
    "it seems safe to conclude that the coronal fe abundance in @xmath0 crb   is close to the photospheric value , in contrast to the solar case where the coronal fe abundance is enhanced by a factor of a few .",
    "this situation is also different from that in several magnetically active stars that show a similar u - shape abundance pattern but a net fe depletion in their corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is difficult to discuss the case of ca since we derived large uncertainties and @xcite did not obtain a ca abundance .",
    "nevertheless , a scenario appears to emerge in which low - fip elements are depleted in very active stars that show an inverse fip effect .",
    "the abundances of the lowest - fip elements in intermediately active stars rise up to be quasi - photospheric while the intermediate - fip elements still have their abundances depleted , thus the abundance pattern shows a u shape .",
    "finally , in the less active stars , low - fip elements have their abundances further increased to become superphotospheric and intermediate - fip elements have their abundances quasi - photospheric .",
    "such stars show an abundance pattern similar to the solar fip effect .",
    "our methodological approach to the _ xmm - newton _   data ( i.e. , multi-@xmath15 components ) differs significantly from the approach by @xcite ( i.e. , separate treatment of continuum and lines , reconstruction of a differential emission measure [ dem ] distribution based on extracted fe line fluxes ) .",
    "we focus this section on comparing their model with ours .",
    "specifically , we test whether their _ chandra _   model can provide an adequate fit to our _ xmm - newton _   data , and vice versa .",
    "some caveats should be mentioned : i ) @xcite use the apec 1.10 version whereas we use the more recent apec 1.3 version ; ii ) @xmath0 crb s x - ray luminosity was @xmath30 times higher during the _ xmm - newton _   observation ( @xmath31  erg  s@xmath32 ) than during the _ chandra _   observation ( @xmath33  erg  s@xmath32 ) . in our comparison",
    ", we will take this correction factor into account .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether this factor should be applied to all temperature components or only part of them .",
    "iii ) it is possible that real changes in the x - ray spectrum ( e.g. , due to em or abundance variations ) occurred between the two observations .",
    "we will assume in this study that this was not the case .",
    "we have used @xcite s quiescent dem ( realization # 2 ) together with the quiescent abundances reported in their table 5 ( we set the c and ca abundances equal to the fe abundance , and we set ni=0.1 times solar photospheric , as described by @xcite ) . however , after iterations with dr .",
    "osten , we discovered that their quiescent dem ( as shown in their fig .",
    "10a ) is accurate from @xmath34 to @xmath35 for the continuum and that the last point at @xmath36 was used only for the emission lines .",
    "however , this temperature bin essentially contributed a few tens of percent to the flux in the fe k@xmath20 complex .",
    "this oversight plays no significant role for our comparison exercise with the _ xmm - newton _   data .",
    "thus , in practice , we constructed in xspec a multi-@xmath15 model with 15 components at temperatures at @xmath34 to @xmath35 with intervals of @xmath37  dex .",
    "we used @xcite s dem values , multiplied them by the original dem bin width ( @xmath37  dex ) to obtain the total em for each temperature component , and further divided by 2 since @xcite accounted for the fact that half the radiation is absorbed by the star .",
    "we have then convolved the model of @xcite in xspec over an interval [ @xmath38 , @xmath39 subdivided into @xmath40 subintervals [ @xmath41 , @xmath42 of widths @xmath43 ( thus @xmath44 for @xmath45 ) .",

    "osten ) overlaid with the _ xmm - newton _   model .",
    "we find surprisingly good agreement , despite different absolute abundances .",
    "there are , however , some discrepancies . in fig",
    "[ fig : xmmwchan2 ] , the @xmath47     line is overestimated compared to the _ xmm - newton _   data . but this is no different from the analysis of @xcite which overestimated the _ chandra _   line flux as well ( see their fig .  10a , center panel ) .",
    "in addition , the @xcite model overestimates the rgs continuum level by about 40% at wavelengths longer than 25     ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xmmwchan3 ] ) . a few possible explanations can be put forward : i ) the _ chandra _   hetgs wavelength range ends around 25   , therefore the @xcite model had no possibility to accurately take into account the flux beyond this instrumental limit .",
    "@xcite reported a similar situation in which the model of @xcite , based on hetgs data , could reproduce the general properties of the rgs spectrum of mcg -6 - 30 - 15 below 23   , but it overestimated the flux for @xmath48   ; ii ) calibration problems at long wavelengths are possible ; however , the 40% overestimate is larger than the current calibration knowledge ; iii ) it was inadequate to multiply the ems of @xcite s model by a constant value of @xmath30 to account for the x - ray luminosity difference of @xmath0 crb   between the _ chandra _   and _ xmm - newton _   observations .",
    "it is possible that the variation is due to some part of the dem only ( e.g. , at high temperatures ) .",
    "however , the long - wavelength continuum level is essentially determined by the high - temperature components ( which describe the short and mid - wavelength ranges accurately ) , and , therefore we find this possibility less probable .",
    "instead we propose that the lack of spectral coverage in the range @xmath49     by _ chandra _ hetgs slightly biased the emd of @xcite to overestimate the long - wavelength flux .",
    "we note that , although @xcite used _",
    "line fluxes to determine their dem , these authors did not make use of the continuum level in the _ euve _ wavelength range ( which is about 5 times lower than the continuum level at 30   ) .",
    "our _ xmm - newton _   model ( whose ems were divided by @xmath30 ) shows generally excellent agreement with the _ chandra _  data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chanwxmm1]-[fig : chanwxmm3 ] ) .",
    "however , the flux in the triplet near @xmath50    was underestimated ; it suggests that ar abundances obtained from simultaneous epic+rgs fits might be underestimated generally .",
    "the @xcite model , however , predicts l - shell fluxes of ar and s lines at long wavelengths which are consistent with the rgs data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xmmwchan3 ] ) , despite the long - standing problem of the lack of atomic data of l - shell lines of low - z elements or their inaccuracy in current atomic databases @xcite . with a few exceptions , we find , therefore , excellent agreement among different models derived with different techniques from different data sets , but which show very similar abundance ratios but different absolute abundances .",
    "this exercise casts some doubt on the preference of one method over the other to determine coronal abundances , and it demonstrates that the determination of true absolute abundances remains a challenge .",
    "crb s corona compared to the solar photospheric fe abundance . ]",
    "other studies support this interpretation .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the bright fk com - type giant yy men using different methods and found that , for a given data set ( either _ chandra _   or _ xmm - newton _ ) , slight differences in absolute abundances were derived .",
    "however , they found excellent agreement for the abundance ratios relative to fe . in parallel , @xcite studied the _ xmm - newton _   data of a sample of solar analogs with different methods as well .",
    "they also observed the robustness of abundance ratios and demonstrated the presence of a transition from a solar - like fip effect in inactive stars to an inverse fip effect in active stars .",
    "@xcite used one method but different sets of emission lines to derive the coronal abundances in ab dor ( and v471 tau ) and found similar abundances .",
    "they further compared their results with those in earlier studies and found good agreement in the general trend , albeit with some significant differences .",
    "thus , in brief , despite the use of various methodologies , abundance patterns as a function of the fip appear robust and look dependent on the magnetic activity level .",

    "finally , we obtained an upper limit of the coronal density based on the triplet ( @xmath69  @xmath3 ) which is consistent with other measurements in @xmath0 crb   @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite found higher densities ( @xmath70  @xmath3 ) from spectral lines formed at higher temperatures than . however , due to the lower spectral resolution of the rgs ( compared to _",
    "chandra _",
    "hetgs ) , we could not confirm such coronal densities .    in conclusion",
    ", this study has confirmed that the abundance ratio pattern in @xmath0 crb s coronae does not follow that of a simple inverse fip effect or of a solar - like fip effect , but appears to be more complex .",
    "however , the lack of data on photospheric abundances in @xmath0 crb   to compare with still casts doubt on whether such a pattern is real or mirrors the stellar composition .",
    "nevertheless , the underabundance of fe in @xmath0 crb s coronae ( compared to the solar photospheric fe abundance ) appears robust and is consistent with its abundance found in the stellar photosphere .",
