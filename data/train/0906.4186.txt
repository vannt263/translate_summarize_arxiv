    "a fundamental objective of ocean circulation theory is to characterise and quantify the relative importance of the mechanical and thermodynamical forcing in driving and stirring the oceans .",
    "although the oceans are highly nonlinear a system , ocean circulation theory nevertheless historically evolved under the assumption that separate theories for the wind - driven and buoyancy - driven circulation could be developed , as it the two kind of circulation could be regarded as somehow decoupled . from a thermodynamic viewpoint , this is somehow justified from the fact that mechanical forcing , unlike the buoyancy forcing , does not modify the fluid parcels buoyancy , suggesting that distinct effects should be observable . in the thermodynamic engineering literature ,",
    "mechanical forcing is commonly regarded as `` shaft '' work , which alters the energy of the fluid without altering its total entropy . in oceanographic textbooks ,",
    "wind - driven circulation theories usually occupy a more prominent place that buoyancy - driven circulation theories .",
    "indeed , it turns out to be relatively easy to link the near surface transport ( ekman theory ) or the vertically - integrated transport ( sverdrup theory ) to the wind stress or its spatial derivatives in a quantitative relatively accurate way .",
    "theories for the buoyancy - driven circulation , on the other hand , are often more qualitative , and at best offer only tentative scaling arguments to relate the strength of the large - scale overturning cell taking place in the meridional / vertical plane , e.g. @xcite . from a physical viewpoint ,",
    "the two main salient ingredients of the buoyancy - driven circulation have been traditionally associated with high - latitude cooling , envisioned as the destabilising mechanism setting up the meridional overturning circulation into motion , and turbulent diapycnal mixing , envisioned as the process required to carry heat from the surface at the depths cooled by deep water formation , thus precluding the oceans to fill up with dense and salty waters .",
    "physically , however , the buoyancy - driven circulation can only be regarded as independent of the mechanical forcing if one can establish that the stirring required to maintain turbulent diapycnal mixing is predominantly sustained by the work rate done by the surface buoyancy fluxes @xmath1 ( i.e. , the rate of available potential energy production , see @xcite ) .",
    "a crucial question , therefore , is how large is @xmath1 ? in their observational analysis of ocean energetics , @xcite found @xmath7 , and concluded that the buoyancy forcing was as important as the wind in forcing and stirring the oceans .",
    "this result , however , was challenged by @xcite ( mw98 thereafter ) , who contended that the so - called @xcite s theorem forbids @xmath1 to be significant , and hence that turbulent diapycnal mixing must be primarily be sustained by the work rate done by the mechanical forcing due to the wind and tides , leading to the idea that the buoyancy - driven circulation is actually mechanically - driven .",
    "mw98 furthermore sought to quantify the magnitude of the mechanical sources of stirring required to sustain diapycnal mixing in the oceans .",
    "their main result is the following formula : @xmath8 where @xmath2 is the work rate done by the mechanical sources of stirring , @xmath9 is the rate at which the background gravitational potential energy @xmath10 decreases as the result of high - latitude cooling , and @xmath3 is the so - called mixing efficiency , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "mw98 estimated @xmath11 from assuming the deep water formation rate to be known , and used the canonical value @xmath12 for the mixing efficiency to conclude that @xmath13 was required to sustain the observed rate of turbulent diapycnal mixing and its associated poleward heat transport of about @xmath14 . since the wind forcing provides no more than about @xmath15 , this result suggests an apparent shortfall of about @xmath15 of mechanical stirring that mw98 argued must only come from the work rate done by the tides , spawning much research over the past decade on the issue of tidal mixing .",
    "mw98 s study prompted much debate over the past decade about the relative importance of the surface buoyancy forcing , and about whether sandstrom s theorem really implied for @xmath1 to be negligible .",
    "recently , @xcite revisited a number of misconceptions about the nature of energy conversions in turbulent stratified fluids by extending the available potential energy framework of @xcite to the fully compressible navier - stokes equations ( cnse thereafter ) .",
    "one of the main result was to demonstrate from first principles that : @xmath16 which physically states that the production rate of @xmath17 is approximately equal to the rate at which @xmath10 decreases as the result of high - latitude cooling .",
    "this result is extremely important , because it rigourously proves that it is inconsistent to assume @xmath9 to be large while simultaneously assuming @xmath1 to be negligible , as done in mw98 . as a result , rather than establishing that the work rate done by surface buoyancy forcing is small , mw98 s study actually establishes precisely the contrary , since their estimate @xmath18 implies @xmath19 , which turns out to be very close to @xcite s lower bound for @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , @xcite was able to show that a generalisation of mw98 s eq .",
    "( [ mw98_constraint ] ) for a non - boussinesq fluid can be rigourously derived from first principles by combining the mechanical energy budget for @xmath17 and @xmath10 separately , the final result taking the form : @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a non - boussinesq nonlinearity parameter which is such that @xmath23 for water and seawater , @xmath3 is the mixing efficiency , and @xmath24 is the so - called flux richardson number , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "mw98 s eq .",
    "( [ mw98_constraint ] ) is recovered in the limiting case @xmath25 describing a boussinesq fluid with a linear equation of state , by using the above result that @xmath26 .    the fact that the generalisation of mw98 s result can be written as a formula linking @xmath2 and @xmath1 rather than @xmath2 and @xmath9 raises the question of whether it is really appropriate to interpret eq .",
    "( [ general_constraint ] ) ( and hence eq . ( [ mw98_constraint ] ) ) as a constraint on the amount of @xmath2 required to sustain diapycnal mixing in the oceans , as suggested by mw98 .",
    "indeed , it seems that such an interpretation implicitly assumes that both @xmath1 and @xmath3 can be regarded as fixed in some sense , but whether this is the correct way to interpret eq .",
    "( [ general_constraint ] ) is unclear , given that the latter can be rewritten in the two following ways : @xmath27 or as : @xmath28 i.e. , under the form of a constraint either on @xmath1 or on @xmath29 .",
    "note that from observations , plausible numbers for the wind and buoyancy forcing are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which , if inserted into eq .",
    "( [ xirf_constraint ] ) yields : @xmath32 another way to pose the problem initially formulated by mw98 would be to ask the question of whether the above value for @xmath29 can be ruled out from what we know about mixing efficiency ( and the role played by the nonlinearity of the equation of state , but we know less about the latter ) . although the value @xmath33 is often assumed , it is important to realize that such value mostly pertains to mechanically - driven turbulent mixing , as occurs in relation with shear flow instability for instance .",
    "indeed , mixing efficiency values as high as @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) have been reported by @xcite for buoyancy - driven mixing associated with rayleigh - taylor instability . since @xmath1 is comparable to @xmath2 , values of @xmath3 intermediate between those for mechanically- and buoyancy - driven mixing should be expected .    in trying to figure out the exact physical meaning of eq .",
    "( [ general_constraint ] ) , it is important to discuss the nature and structure of @xmath2 and @xmath1 in more details .",
    "thus , the work rate done by the wind stress is given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the wind stress at the ocean surface , and @xmath38 is the ocean surface velocity .",
    "the important point about @xmath2 is that it is a correlation between the external forcing ( the wind stress ) and a parameter depending upon the particular state of the system ( the surface velocity ) . in other words , it is essential to realize that @xmath2 can not be determined from the knowledge of the external forcing alone .",
    "this is important , because eq . ( [ wind_work ] ) expresses the possibility for the wind - driven circulation to be controlled by the buoyancy forcing , to the extent that the latter is able to influence the surface velocity . in order to gain insight into the potential importance of the buoyancy control of the wind - driven circulation",
    ", it would be interesting to compute @xmath2 for a purely wind forced homogeneous ocean model .",
    "doing so , however , is beyond the scope of this paper . for the present purposes",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath2 is primarily determined by the wind forcing , and that buoyancy forcing only alters it as a second order effect , which seems plausible on the basis that the near surface circulation in the oceans is usually thought to be the signature of the wind forcing rather than the buoyancy forcing .",
    "with regard to the work rate done by surface buoyancy fluxes , it was shown by @xcite to be given by the following expression : @xmath39 in the case of a compressible thermally - stratified fluid forced by surface heat fluxes , where @xmath40 is the surface temperature of the fluid parcels , and @xmath41 the temperature the surface parcels would have if displaced adiabatically to their level in @xcite s reference state , while @xmath42 is the diabatic rate of heating cooling / heating due to the surface heat fluxes .",
    "useful approximations for @xmath1 can be obtained by expanding @xmath40 as a taylor series expansion around the surface pressure @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the adiabatic lapse rate , leading to : @xmath46 @xmath47 by using the approximation @xmath48 , the latter expression being actually the boussinesq approximation of @xmath1 derived by @xcite provided that one regards the thermal expansion @xmath49 and specific heat capacity @xmath50 as constant ( the suffix @xmath51 means that the variables have to be estimated in @xcite s reference state ) . as for @xmath2 , @xmath1 also takes the form of a correlation between the external forcing ( the heating / cooling rate at the surface ) and a parameter depending on the particular state of the system , namely @xmath52 . eqs . ( [ gape_exact ] ) and ( [ gape_formula ] )",
    "make it possible , therefore , for the buoyancy - driven circulation to be mechanically - controlled .",
    "physically , this is expected , because mechanical forcing is widely agreed to increase diapycnal mixing , which should produce a deeper thermocline , thereby allowing dense plumes to penetrate deeper , thus increasing @xmath1 and hence the buoyancy - driven circulation .",
    "interestingly , this appears consistent with the laboratory experiments by @xcite which provide evidence that the lateral motion of a stirring rod can greatly enhance the strength of horizontal convection ( see @xcite for a review on this topic ) .",
    "this paper examines the possibility of interpreting this result as the consequence that @xmath1 , and hence the buoyancy - driven circulation , is increased by the work rate done by the stirring rod . to that end , section 2 seeks to extend eq .",
    "( [ general_constraint ] ) to also describe the purely buoyancy - driven case for which it is not valid .",
    "the physical meaning of the extended formula is then explored by means of idealised numerical experiments in section 3 .",
    "finally , section 4 presents a discussion of the results .",
    "our starting point is the theoretical description of the energetics of mechanically and thermodynamically forced turbulent stratified fluids recently derived by @xcite pertaining to a thermally - stratified fluid governed by the fully compressible navier - stokes equations ( ncse thereafter ) , which builds upon the available potential energy framework previously introduced by @xcite for a boussinesq fluid with a linear equation of state . in @xcite s",
    "description , the energetics is described at leading order by means of the following five evolution equations : @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the volume - integrated kinetic energy , @xmath17 is @xcite s volume - integrated available potential energy , @xmath10 is the volume - integrated gravitational potential energy of @xcite s reference - state , @xmath59 is the volume - integrated of a subcomponent of internal energy @xmath60 that we call the dead part of @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the volume - integrated of another subcomponent of @xmath61 called the exergy .",
    "physically , variations in @xmath59 are associated with variations in the equivalent thermodynamic equilibrium temperature @xmath63 of the system , whereas variations in @xmath62 reflect variations in the reference temperature profile @xmath64 .",
    "the other important conversion terms are @xmath65 , the so - called buoyancy flux that represents the reversible conversion between @xmath58 and @xmath17 ; @xmath1 , the production rate of @xmath17 that physically represents a conversion between @xmath59 and @xmath17 ; @xmath4 and @xmath66 represent the laminar and turbulent rate of exchange between @xmath62 and @xmath10 due to molecular diffusion ; @xmath67 is the dissipation rate of @xmath58 into internal energy @xmath59 by molecular viscous processes ; @xmath68 is the dissipation rate of @xmath17 into internal energy @xmath59 by molecular diffusive processes .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 plays the role of a thermodynamic efficiency that is very small for a nearly incompressible fluid , and which controls how much of the net surface heating rate @xmath70 splits between @xmath62 and @xmath59 .    as previously shown by @xcite , a number of conversion terms appear to be strongly correlated to each other .",
    "this is the case for @xmath68 and @xmath66 , owing to both terms : 1 ) being controlled by molecular diffusion ; 2 ) being controlled by the spectral distribution of the @xmath17 density , see @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of the latter concept . for a compressible thermally - stratified fluid",
    ", @xcite showed that this correlation between @xmath68 and @xmath66 can be written under the general form : @xmath71 where @xmath22 is a parameter that measures the importance of the nonlinearity of the equation of state , such that @xmath25 for a boussinesq fluid with a linear equation of state , but @xmath23 for water or seawater .",
    "the second type of conversion terms that are correlated to each other are @xmath1 and @xmath9 owing to both terms being controlled by the surface buoyancy forcing .",
    "@xcite shows that to a good approximation , one usually has : @xmath72 for the sake of brevity , the reader is referred to @xcite for the details about the explicit forms of all the terms entering the above energy equations , as they are unimportant for the arguments developed in this paper .",
    "( [ gper_budget ] ) schematically illustrates the energetics of a mechanically and thermodynamically forced stratified fluids associated with the above equations .",
    "for all practical purposes , @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the work rate done by the buoyancy and mechanical forcing respectively , whereas @xmath68 and @xmath67 represent the two terms dissipating the `` available '' mechanical energy @xmath73 .",
    "a fundamental question posed by this paper is what controls the magnitude of the buoyancy - driven circulation , that is , the circulation drawing its energy from @xmath1 , with and without mechanical stirring acting on the fluid . in order to answer this question ,",
    "we first need to introduce a couple of parameters that are traditionally used to measure the efficiency of turbulent mixing , the so - called mixing efficiency @xmath3 and the flux richardson number @xmath74 , which are defined here as follows : @xmath75 @xmath76 the physical rationale for such definitions , as well as their connection to other existing definitions , was discussed in details in @xcite to which the reader is referred to for details . from a practical viewpoint ,",
    "the differences in existing definitions is unimportant , as least in the context of a boussinesq fluid , as then all definitions are then numerically equivalent , even if based on different physical assumptions . in particular , the present definitions allow to recover mw98 s eq .",
    "( [ mw98_constraint ] ) , as discussed below . to distinguish them from existing definitions , @xcite refer to the above @xmath3 and @xmath74 as the  dissipative  mixing efficiency and flux richardson number respectively .",
    "in a second step , the mechanical energy balance is constructed by summing the steady - state version of the @xmath58 and @xmath17 equations , which yields : @xmath77 now , by combining this equation with the definition of the flux richardson number ( i.e. , eq .",

    "using the definition of @xmath22 above , the @xmath10 budget provides the following relationship : @xmath83 which after some algebra eventually yields : @xmath84 eq .",
    "( [ general_constraint2 ] ) is one of the most important result of this paper , as it represents one way to demonstrate the interconnection of the work rate done by the wind and buoyancy forcing in general .",

    "( [ general_constraint2 ] ) shows that in absence of mechanical forcing , the work rate done by the surface buoyancy fluxes is given by : @xmath88 or , for a boussinesq fluid : @xmath89 the latter two results are interesting , because they show that although @xmath4 is small by construction , it does not forbid in principle @xmath1 to be large provided that @xmath90 or @xmath91 can become small enough .",
    "the problem , however , is that the latter conditions require @xmath74 to be close to unity for a boussinesq fluid , or equivalently @xmath5 , which is much larger than the widely used canonical value @xmath92 .",
    "on the other hand , we are not aware of any published value for @xmath3 pertaining to horizontal convection , so that sufficient empirical evidence to be really conclusive .",

    "this theoretical result suggests therefore that @xmath1 can be dramatically enhanced by the presence of mechanical stirring , provided that the latter provides positive work to the system ( i.e. , such that @xmath94 ) .",

    ", there is a tendency to regard the mixing efficiency @xmath3 as some kind of universal parameter whose value is relatively constant and uniform throughout the oceans .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , to examine whether this is the case in the present numerical experiments . to that end , the viscous dissipation @xmath67 and diffusive dissipation @xmath68 were estimated for all experiments , the values being reported in table 1 .",
    "as it turns out , @xmath3 is found to vary widely across the different experiments .",
    "its maximum value is achieved in the purely buoyancy - driven case , for which @xmath122 .",
    "interestingly , this value is significantly larger than the value @xmath123 reported by @xcite in the context of rayleigh - taylor instability , and which represents so far the highest value of mixing efficiency ever reported . the rayleigh - taylor instability , however , is known to have the peculiar property that the @xmath17 driving the instability is not entirely available for turbulent mixing . for this reason",
    ", @xcite suggested that higher values of mixing efficiency could in principle be achieved for buoyancy - driven turbulent mixing events if the above constraint could be relaxed .",
    "as it turns out , horizontal convection does not suffer from the limitations attached to the rayleigh - taylor instability , making it possible to achieve values of @xmath3 significantly large than unity .",
    "the addition of mechanical stirring , however , is seen in table 1 to systematically reduce @xmath3 , the largest reduction occurring for the strong anti - clockwise mechanical forcing . in that case , a value of @xmath124 is reached , which is much closer to the value @xmath12 commonly used in the literature .",
    "the present numerical experiments therefore suggest that the mixing efficiency of a fluid forced both mechanically and thermodynamically is likely to be potentially highly sensitive to the particular configuration considered .",
    "this challenges the notion that @xmath12 should be used in the oceans , given that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are comparable in magnitude in reality .",
    "another interesting question is what is the effect of the mechanical stirring on the heat transport , which was also raised in mw98 s study .",
    "the last column of table 2 provides insight into this issue by providing the maximum value of the heat transport for each experiment .",
    "the most striking result is that the heat transport appears to be drastically increased when the mechanical forcing supports the thermally - direct circulation , but decreased when the mechanical forcing opposes the latter . in the actual oceans ,",
    "the wind forcing creates surface ekman cells that are alternatively helping or opposing the large - scale thermally direct cell in the atlantic ocean responsible for the atlantic heat transport .",
    "it seems therefore difficult to conclude at this stage whether the overall net effect of the mechanical forcing in the oceans is to directly contribute to the strength of the overturning circulation by being a net source of vorticity of the right sign , or if its contribution is only indirect and limited to its increase of @xmath1 and hence of the strength of the buoyancy - driven component of the overturning .",
    "in this paper , the effect of mechanical stirring on buoyancy - driven flows was investigated both theoretically and numerically .",
    "the most important theoretical result are the formula eqs .",
    "( [ general_constraint2 ] ) and ( [ general_constraint_boussinesq ] ) linking the work done by the mechanical stirring to the work rate done by the surface buoyancy fluxes via the bulk mixing efficiency of the system , valid for the compressible navier - stokes equations and for the boussinesq model respectively .",
    "these formula are a further generalisation of that derived by @xcite , which extends @xcite s previous result on the energy requirement on the mechanical sources of stirring to sustain diapycnal mixing in the oceans .",
    "the actual physical meaning of the formula eqs .",
    "( [ general_constraint2 ] ) and ( [ general_constraint_boussinesq ] ) is not entirely clear , however .",
    "physically , the formula only seem to express the existence of a mechanical control on buoyancy - driven flows and vice - versa , rather than a true constraint on @xmath2 , in contrast with the interpretation put forward by @xcite .",
    "this idea is further re - enforced by the structure of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , which demonstrate that the work rate done by the mechanical and buoyancy forcing does not simply depend on the external forcing ( i.e. , the wind and surface buoyancy fluxes ) , but also on the actual state of the system . in other words , the work rate done by either the wind and buoyancy forcing depends sensitively on the work rate done by the other kind of forcing . in this paper , this idea is examined from the viewpoint of the buoyancy - driven circulation , by demonstrating that the presence of mechanical stirring can have dramatic effects on the value of @xmath1 owing to its direct effect on diapycnal mixing and hence on the structure of the thermocline . the other way that mechanical forcing can affect @xmath1 is by modifying the near surface temperature , thereby modifying the net flux into the system , since the flux is also to be determined as part of the solution when a surface temperature boundary condition is imposed .    in the purely buoyancy - driven case ,",
    "( [ general_constraint2 ] ) demonstrates that large values of @xmath1 are in principle achievable provided that the `` dissipative '' mixing efficiency @xmath125 defined in @xcite is large enough .",
    "the particular numerical experiment considered in this paper suggests that this is possible , since the value @xmath126 was reached in the purely buoyancy - driven case , which is one order of magnitude larger than the value @xmath12 currently assumed in most studies of turbulent mixing .",
    "although the result is only tentative , since a more systematic investigation is required to ascertain the robustness of the results , it is important to note that this appears to be consistent with the numerical results of @xcite that show entropy production in horizontal convection to increase with the rayleigh number . according to our theoretical results ,",
    "this is indeed only possible if @xmath68 and hence @xmath1 also increase with the rayleigh number . on the other hand , @xcite s `` anti - turbulence theorem ''",
    "states that the viscous dissipation of kinetic energy is bounded from above by a bound that is independent of the rayleigh number .",
    "if @xmath68 increases with @xmath127 with no corresponding increase in @xmath67 , then one can infer that the dissipative mixing efficiency @xmath3 must also increase with the rayleigh number .",
    "testing this hypothesis further will be an important future research goal .    as shown by @xcite , the `` anti - turbulence theorem ''",
    "places a stringent constraint on the magnitude of the viscous dissipation rate of kinetic energy that can be sustained by buoyancy forcing alone . as a consequence , mechanical forcing appears critical to produce significant amount of viscous dissipation of kinetic energy @xmath67 .",
    "however , because of the relatively low mixing efficiency of mechanically - driven mixing , it is usually the case that the addition of mechanical forcing to horizontal convection results in relatively modest increase in @xmath68 compared to that in @xmath67 .",
    "the overall consequence is to decrease the mixing efficiency @xmath3 of the system as compared to the purely buoyancy - driven case , as verified in the numerical experiments considered here for which @xmath94 .",
    "the decrease in mixing efficiency resulting from mechanically stirring horizontal convection does not preclude an increase in @xmath1 however , as expected from the theoretical formula , and verified in the numerical experiments . in our opinion , this is the fundamental reason why the strength of the overturning circulation in @xcite s laboratory experiments appears to be greatly enhanced by the action of the stirring rod .",
    "depending on the particular circumstances , it appears possible for the mechanical forcing to contribute directly to the observed overturning increase , in addition to the indirect effect it has on the increase of @xmath1 , as in the particular case of the clockwise mechanical forcing experiment . in the cases where the mechanical forcing acts anti - clockwise",
    ", however , only the increase in @xmath1 appears to be directly responsible for the increase in the overturning .",
    "the latter case is likely to be the one pertaining to @xcite s laboratory experiments , as it seems difficult to see how the lateral motions of the stirring rod could contribute to the vorticity source required to drive a thermally direct cell .",
    "the present results make it hard to regard eq .",
    "( [ general_constraint2 ] ) as a constraint on the mechanical sources of stirring , as proposed by @xcite , given that @xmath1 is likely more sensitive to a change in the mechanical forcing than @xmath2 to a change in the buoyancy forcing , although this has not been directly verified .",
    "the other main difficulty in interpreting eq .",
    "( [ general_constraint2 ] ) as a constraint on @xmath2 comes from the fact that the value of @xmath3 , far from having the value of @xmath128 commonly affixed to it , appears to be extremely sensitive to the details of the mechanical and buoyancy forcing . with the present experiments ,",
    "values were found to range between 0.6 and 1.78 . the fact that buoyancy forcing is as important as the mechanical stirring due to the wind and tides has important consequences for the value of mixing efficiency one should use in the oceans .",
    "we note that if one uses @xmath35 in @xcite s paper , the requirement on the mechanical sources of stirring reduces drastically to @xmath129 , which is easily achieved by the wind alone .",
    "future research , therefore , should aim at understanding the physical mechanisms controlling the value of mixing efficiency in mechanically- and thermodynamically forced stratified fluids .",
    "we note that to date , mixing efficiency is traditionally studied in the context of freely decaying turbulence , not in the context of forced / dissipated systems .",
    "interestingly , @xcite suggest that coarse resolution numerical ocean models behave as predicted by the present theory , as they found no overturning circulation cell in the total absence of wind forcing in the atlantic ocean .",
    "another issue of interest are the consequences of mechanical control for the multiple equilibria of the thermohaline circulation , recently discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed , such a problem is usually studied under the assumption that the turbulent mixing parameters can be somehow regarded as fixed .",
    "the present results suggest , however , that the overall value of @xmath3 might differ for different equilibria .",

    "<S> the theoretical analysis of the energetics of mechanically - stirred horizontal convection for a boussinesq fluid yields the formula : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the work rate done by the buoyancy and mechanical forcing respectively , @xmath3 is the mixing efficiency , and @xmath4 is the background rate of increase in gravitational potential energy due to molecular diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the formula shows that mechanical stirring can easily induce a very strong buoyancy - driven overturning cell ( meaning a large @xmath1 ) even for a relatively low mixing efficiency , whereas this is only possible in absence of mechanical stirring if @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the buoyancy - driven overturning becomes mechanically controlled when @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this result explains why the buoyancy - driven overturning cell in the laboratory experiments by @xcite is amplified by the lateral motions of a stirring rod . </S>",
    "<S> the formula implies that the thermodynamic efficiency of the ocean heat engine , far from being negligibly small as is commonly claimed , might in fact be as large as can be thanks to the stirring done by the wind and tides . </S>",
    "<S> these ideas are further illustrated by means of idealised numerical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> a non - boussinesq extension of the above formula is also given . </S>"
