    "understanding the finite temperature effects of correlated quantum systems is a complicated problem . even at zero temperature",
    "the complex interplay of different interactions can lead to a wide range of interesting phenomena , such as bound states , fractionalization , quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) or bose - einstein - condensation @xcite .",
    "even more , at finite temperature , interesting features emerge from the interplay of thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "especially dynamic correlations are directly affected by microscopic interactions as well as by thermal effects .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", it is often advantageous to describe the low - energy physics of quantum systems by an effective model which includes the motion and interactions of quasi - particles of which the number is conserved or almost conserved .",
    "there are numerous ways to derive effective models , an incomplete list comprises renormalization approaches @xcite , continuous unitary transformations ( cuts ) @xcite , and variational approaches , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite for variational approaches based essentially on intuition and refs .",
    "@xcite for variational approaches based on matrix product states ( mps ) .",
    "variational approaches and cuts generically provide effective models at zero temperature .",
    "thus they do not address the thermal effects directly which renders quantitative comparisons with experiments difficult .",
    "but if the effective model is formulated in second quantization it can be evaluated also at finite temperatures by additional theoretical tools .",
    "such tools are for instance exact diagonalization , thermodynamic bethe ansatz , or diagrammatic approaches .",
    "hardcore bosons are one generic type of elementary excitations in quantum lattice systems @xcite .",
    "they behave like normal bosons on different lattice sites , but at one site only a single excitation is allowed at maximum .",
    "in contrast to free bosons or free fermions , the thermal properties of hardcore bosons are unknown and not trivial even if they are not subject to further interactions .",
    "the motivation to study hardcore bosonic excitations originates from quantum magnets @xcite .",
    "a variety of elementary hardcore bosonic excitations exist in quantum magnets , e.g. , spin - flip excitations in polarized systems , domain walls in one - dimensional systems with degenerate ground states , or triplon excitations in strongly dimerized systems .",
    "experimentally , inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) provides a convenient tool do study the effects of finite temperatures on dynamic correlations @xcite , namely by probing the spin dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of sites .    in this article",
    "we focus on gapped hardcore boson systems .",
    "quantum antiferromagnets built from dimers of @xmath2 spins on the lattice are of special interest .",
    "examples include spin chains @xcite , spin ladders @xcite , coupled ladders @xcite and dimers coupled in several spatial directions @xcite .",
    "this underlines that the topic of the present article is of current interest and relevant to experiments although it focuses on conceptual issues and benchmarks of the approach .    for gapped quantum magnets",
    "the generic dsf spectrum consists of a dominant single quasi - particle peak and weaker multi - particle continua . at finite temperature",
    ", the single - particle peak is broadened due to thermal scattering . in recent years ,",
    "the energy resolution of ins experiments improved significantly .",
    "this makes it possible to investigate the position and the shape of the response as function of temperature .",
    "various theoretical approaches have been applied to describe the effects of finite temperature on the dynamics in quantum magnets .",
    "one of them is complete diagonalization to compute the lehmann representation of the dsf @xcite . for one - dimensional systems , essler and",
    "co - workers developed a variety of approaches based on integrability , bethe - ansatz equations and fermionization in refs .",
    "certain thermal effects such as the narrowing of the dispersion and shifts of spectral weight can already be captured by mean - field approaches @xcite .",
    "the combination of integrability and density - matrix renormalization is a very useful strategy where applicable @xcite .",
    "an advanced numerical approach is based on density - matrix renormalization formulated in matrix product states in the frequency space @xcite .",
    "the above listed methods rely essentially on the one - dimensionality of the system under study . in principle",
    ", the complete diagonalization can be applied to any dimension .",
    "but the tractable system size measured in the linear extension becomes very small for dimensions higher than one .",
    "thus , recent finite temperature experiments on 3d materials @xcite can not be described by these approaches . a @xmath3 expansion with @xmath4 being the coordination number by jensen @xcite agrees remarkably with the experimental data .",
    "the underlying idea relies on a description of the scattering of the elementary excitations with an effective medium @xcite .",
    "the caveat of the approach is that it is unclear how it can be systematically extended beyond the linear order in @xmath3 .",
    "already in this linear order , non - physical double poles have to be eliminated by a plausible assumption in order to preserve causality .      in 2014 , we introduced a diagrammatic perturbative approach based on a low - temperature expansion which does not require a particular dimensionality @xcite .",
    "the systematic control parameter of the approach is the low density of thermally excited hardcore bosons which is proportional to @xmath5 in a gapped system where @xmath6 is inverse temperature and @xmath7 the energy gap .",
    "the method works conceptually in any dimension ; it directly addresses frequency and momentum space in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore finite size effects and the ill - defined continuation from imaginary matsubara frequencies to real frequencies are avoided .",
    "furthermore the approach lends itself for effective models at @xmath8 derived by other methods .",
    "a key ingredient for the applicability of the advocated approach is that the system conserves the number of quasi - particles ( elementary excitations ) , i.e. , there are no finite anomalous green functions and the vacuum is the ground state of the system .",
    "the method is motivated by the since long known brckner theory in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "but it has also been employed for spin systems at zero temperature by sushkov and co - workers @xcite . in these applications , however , the quantum fluctuations were treated diagrammatically since the brckner idea was not applied to a particle - conserving model @xcite which makes its application non trivial even at zero temperature .",
    "the brckner approach takes into account that the elementary excitations in quantum paramagnets are hardcore bosons , i.e. , a site can be occupied at maximum by a single excitation .",
    "this is enforced by an infinite on - site repulsion .",
    "note that at zero temperature the hardcore constraint is irrelevant for the single - particle dynamics if the hamiltonian is particle conserving .",
    "at finite temperature , however , the hardcore scattering provides the primary source for the loss of coherence of the elementary excitations .",
    "then , the single particle is scattered from the thermally excited background of particles .    in a first article",
    "@xcite we introduced the brckner approach at finite temperatures and tested it for hardcore bosons with a single flavor in one dimension .",
    "the advantage of this model was that it can be solved using the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the brckner approach based on ladder diagrams works very well .",
    "in particular , we empirically found that the intricate sum rules of hardcore bosons were conserved even at high temperatures at and beyond the energy gap @xmath7 within numerical accuracy .",
    "furthermore , the approach yielded a very good approximation for the exact thermal occupation for all temperatures .",
    "this has been recently confirmed and quantified even down to vanishing gaps @xcite . the asymmetric line - shape broadening and bandwidth narrowing found in other theoretical studies @xcite and in experimental studies , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , are retrieved .    in the present paper , we extend the finite - temperature brckner approach to systems with multiple flavors , i.e. , there are hardcore bosons of different kinds . but",
    "each single site can still only be occupied by a single boson .",
    "this situation is relevant wherever the local site is represented by a more complex quantum system with a hilbert space dimension larger than two .",
    "a generic example are systems built from coupled dimers , each consisting of two spins @xmath2 . in these systems",
    "the elementary excitations are mobile @xmath9 triplets , which we call triplons to distinguish them from magnons in ordered magnets @xcite . for full su(2 ) symmetry",
    "the triplons are threefold degenerate , i.e. , they are hardcore bosons with three flavors .",
    "the goal of our study is to investigate the multi - flavor extension of the brckner approach and to gauge the method against exact results .",
    "note that a benchmarked method to calculate finite temperature correlations applicable in any dimension is essential to describe and to explain experimental observations in quantum magnets .",
    "we study the performance of the method with a special focus on sum rules and discuss to which extent our approach represents a conserving approximation for hardcore particles .",
    "we stay here with the one - dimensional case because it allows us to compare the diagrammatic approach to rigorous results .",
    "but it must be emphasized that there is no conceptual obstacle for the application of the diagrammatic approach in higher dimensions as well .    in order to have rigorous results at our disposal",
    "we derive the thermal occupation function for hardcore bosons in one dimension exactly for a nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec.model ] we introduce the multi - flavor hardcore boson model and discuss some of its properties . in the following section [ sec.thermal_occupation ] we derive the exact thermal occupation for a special case of hardcore bosons in one dimension with nearest - neighbor hopping . in section [ sec.diagramm ]",

    "next , in section [ sec.results ] we evaluate the results of the diagrammatic brckner approach on the basis of the findings of the preceding sections . in section [ sec.finite_u ]",
    "we perform various calculations at finite repulsion , i.e. , the bosons repel each other only with a finite energy cost , to clarify to which extent conserving approximations exist for hardcore bosons . finally we conclude in section [ sec.conclusion ] .",

    "in contrast to the situation in our previous work @xcite the scattering amplitude depends on two flavor indices @xmath76 and @xmath77 denoting the different flavors of the propagators @xmath78 in eq .  .",

    "if the flavors are degenerate , i.e. , the propagator @xmath84 does not depend on the index @xmath76 , one can simply replace the sum over the flavor index @xmath77 in by a factor @xmath85 once the self - energy is calculated , one determines the spectral function @xmath86 we conclude that the main difference to the case of hardcore bosons of a single flavor is the factor @xmath87 in eq .   for degenerate flavors .",
    "we emphasize that the spectral function is computed self - consistently , i.e. , we use the bare propagators @xmath88 only as initial guess for the dressed green function @xmath89 in the diagrams . after the first computation of the self - energy we iterate all following calculations with the full propagator @xmath90 with the previously obtained self - energy until we reach self - consistency within numerical tolerance .    for normal bosons ,",
    "i.e. , without infinite interactions , the self - consistent approximation based on ladder diagrams is a conserving approximation as introduced by kadanoff and baym @xcite .",
    "such approximations are derived from a generating functional @xmath91 depending on the dressed propagators .",
    "the self - energy diagrams are obtained from @xmath91 by functional derivation with respect to the propagators .",

    "the integration over all frequencies from @xmath92 to @xmath93 does not commute with the limit @xmath63 because the latter shifts weight to infinity .",
    "this weight is lost in the integration explaining why the weight of the spectral functions of hardcore bosons is reduced as expressed by the right hand side of eq .  .",
    "the other sequence , namely integrating first and then having @xmath66 tend to infinity describes normal bosons and does not alter the sum rule which remains unity .",

    "the fraction of the brillouin zone with low - lying excitations in the range of @xmath108 is smaller than for a narrow band so that the total number of thermally excited particles is significantly lower .",

    "since the spectral lines at finite @xmath66 converge to the result at @xmath136 on increasing @xmath66 , there must be additional weight somewhere in the spectral function to explain the difference to the spectral weight in the @xmath136 case .",

    "[ fig.high_frequency1 ] displays the spectral function @xmath146 over the whole energy range . for finite @xmath66",

    "the signature of this anti - bound state is found in the spectral function of the scattering amplitude resulting from the bethe - salpeter equation ( not shown ) .",

    "we deduce our second key conclusion that the concept of conserving approximations in the sense of baym and kadanoff does not carry over to hardcore bosons in general .",
    "the fundamental questions remains why hardcore bosons with multiple flavors behave differently from single - flavor hardcore bosons in one dimension .",
    "answering this question is beyond the scope of this article although we formulate a hypothesis in the conclusions [ sec.conclusion ] , but further studies are called for .",
    "in this paper , we extended the brckner approach from the single - flavor case to the multi - flavor case of hardcore bosons .",
    "such multi - flavored excitations are for instance experimentally relevant in coupled spin dimers systems where the excitations are threefold degenerate triplons .",
    "we found that the required modifications in the ladder diagrams for degenerate flavors are minimal .",
    "only the prefactor in the self - energy is modified .",
    "the focus of the present work is to gauge the diagrammatic approach in the multi - flavor case against exact results and to study conceptual issues concerning conserving approximations for hardcore bosons .",
    "rigorous results were derived for this purpose for the thermal occupation of hardcore bosons in the case of a one - dimensional chain with nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "the established rigorous relation is of interest in itself because it can be used as benchmark for many approximate analytic or numeric treatments .",
    "it could be derived by observing that the particle degree of freedom and the flavor degree of freedom represent two independent subsystems for _ fixed _ number of bosons .",
    "this helps to treat the thermodynamics .",
    "but the dynamic correlations , for instance the hardcore boson propagator , can not be dealt with because they involve changes of the particle number .",
    "our first key results consists in the benchmarks which clearly showed that the multi - flavor approach based on ladder diagrams works very well for low temperatures .",
    "this is expected from the construction of the approach as the leading linear order of an expansion in powers of @xmath62 .",
    "thus it can be used up to @xmath150 for narrow bands and up to @xmath151 for wide bands . for bosons of a single flavor it worked even better as established previously @xcite . at present",
    ", we can only speculate why the single flavor case is more easily tractable .",
    "the conceptual issue of conserving approximations consists in the question whether the construction of conserving approximations by baym and kadanoff for normal bosons and fermions @xcite carries over to hardcore bosons . in the present article ,",
    "we confirmed and verified for _ finite _ @xmath66 that our choice of self - consistent ladder diagrams represents a conserving approximation in the baym - kadanoff sense .",
    "this holds true independent of the flavor number @xmath30 .",
    "our previous empirical finding @xcite in the single - flavor case @xmath135 , indicated that the hardcore boson sum rules are fulfilled _ as well _ within the numerical accuracy .",
    "thus one could speculate that the baym - kadanoff construction carries over to hardcore bosons .",
    "but the results of the present article for multi - flavor bosons @xmath121 unequivocally show that this is generally not the case .",
    "this constitutes the second key result of our study . for several flavors",
    "the sum rules are not conserved by the ladder diagram .",
    "we stress , however , that the deviations only become sizable at higher temperatures .",
    "we presume that the qualitative difference @xmath135 and @xmath121 is due to the fact that the case of a single hardcore boson in one dimension can be exactly mapped to normal fermions for which conserving approximations exist . in the case of multiple flavors",
    "the corresponding jordan - wigner mapping to multi - flavor fermions does not lead to normal fermions because the ensuing fermions are still hardcore particles repelling each other infinitely strongly if they are of different flavor .",
    "we can still use this mapping to describe the thermodynamics of multi - flavored hardcore bosons for a fixed number of particles .",
    "but dynamic correlations changing the number of particles in the system are not trivially accessible in this way .",
    "we summarize that the brckner approach based on self - consistent ladder diagrams also works for multi - flavor excitations in the interesting low - temperature regime though it is less powerful in comparison to the single - flavor case .",
    "in particular for wider bands , the approach works very well and we argued that the approximation should perform even better in higher dimensions , where the diagrammatic approach can be used as well without conceptual obstacle .",
    "the presented analysis paves the way for the treatment of more realistic models , i.e. , models closer to experimentally relevant systems .",
    "obviously , the dispersion can be straightforwardly generalized .",
    "but also further interactions beyond the hardcore repulsion need to be included .",
    "the analysis of higher dimensional models is called for and first results in the single - flavor case have become available very recently @xcite .",
