    "the determination of the masses ( or equivalently mass - to - light ratios ) of gas - poor galaxies has been an important issue since the discovery that galaxies are stellar systems like the milky way , with mass being a strong driver of many of their properties .",
    "dynamical modelling methods of increased sophistication have been developed over the past decades , all based on the assumption that galaxies can be described as stationary systems .",
    "the first attempt at measuring dynamical masses of galaxies were based on the spherical virial equations @xcite .",
    "these methods have the disadvantage that , for accurate results , they need to assume self - similarity in the galaxy light and mass distribution .",
    "more accurate methods allow for axisymmetry and take the galaxy light distribution into account .",
    "the first detailed axisymmetric models of real galaxies were based on the @xcite equations and assumed a distribution function that depends on two ( out of three ) integrals of motion ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but special classes of three - integral models were also used .",
    "axisymmetric methods were developed to allow for a general orbital distribution , based on @xcite numerical orbital superposition method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "currently the most general available models assume galaxies can be approximated by a stationary triaxial shape ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the above modelling techniques were developed under the assumption that gas - poor galaxies can be well described by stationary axisymmetric or triaxial spheroidal systems . however a key initial result of the atlas@xmath9  survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) is the fact that nearby gas - poor galaxies are actually dominated ( 86 per cent of them ) by fast rotators ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii and paper  iii ) , often with significant disk components and resembling spiral galaxies with the dust removed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper vii ) , 30% of which at least are barred .",
    "the presence of these bars is a difficult problem for all modelling methods and therefore motivates the present study .",
    "bars are density waves which results in a tumbling potential : this figure rotation is often ignored in the popular dynamical modelling methods described above . dynamical models of barred galaxies have been constructed in the past ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the existence of intrinsic degeneracies in the dynamical modelling of bars make the determination of mass quite uncertain even for such models .",
    "in fact even the full amount of information one can obtain today for external galaxies , namely the full line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) at every position on the sky , is not sufficient to uniquely constrain the two free parameters ( @xmath0 and inclination ) of a simple self - consistent axisymmetric model @xcite .",
    "a barred model requires at least two extra parameters ( the position angle ( pa ) and pattern speed of the bar ) and dramatically increases the complexity of the orbital structure and the associated degeneracy of the problem , instead of improving the accuracy of the mass estimate : a broad range of parameters space may well fit the data equally well .",
    "moreover , assuming a galaxy is barred also increases the degeneracy in the mass deprojection problem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is already mathematically non unique in the simple axisymmetric case @xcite .",
    "the application of sophisticated barred models to large samples would be computationally challenging , but feasible exploiting the trivial parallelism of the problem .",
    "however , this brute - force approach does not remove the intrinsic degeneracies so it is not expected to increase the accuracy of the mass determinations , and for this reason does not seem justified .",
    "an alternative approach consists of using some a priori information on the galaxy structure and make empirically - motivated restrictive assumption on the models .",
    "this is the approach we are using in the systematic determination of the masses of the 260 early - type galaxies of the atlas@xmath9  survey @xcite .",
    "we are applying the multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) technique @xcite to accurately describe the photometry of all galaxies in the survey ( scott et al . in prep ) and use the jeans anisotropic mge ( jam ) modelling method @xcite to measure masses .",
    "the jam method is based on a simple and very efficient solution of the jeans equations which allows for orbital anisotropy @xmath10 .",
    "this approach provides good descriptions of the integral - field kinematics of the fast rotator early - type galaxies @xcite , which constitute the large majority of the atlas@xmath9  sample ( see paper  ii and paper  iii ) .",
    "a key motivation for our use of the jam method is that it was shown , using 25 real galaxies @xcite , to agree well within the model uncertainties in the mass determination obtained with the more general axisymmetric schwarzschild approach .",
    "the use of an axisymmetric dynamical modelling method to measure the mass of barred galaxies raises the obvious question of what errors in the mass determination are introduced by the approach .",
    "answering this question is the goal of this paper .",
    "our work is in its spirit an extension to barred disk galaxies of the work by @xcite , which explored the biases introduced by the use of axisymmetric models , when extracting masses of triaxial and prolate simulated spheroidal galaxy remnants .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we briefly describe the multi - gaussian expansion parametrization from @xcite , the semi - isotropic jeans equations and the method used to create the n - body galaxy models . in section  [ sec : jammodel ] , we give an overview of the input models used for the jam modeling in our investigation , and in section  [ sec : results ] we compare the original and recovered values of the corresponding dynamical parameters .",
    "section  [ sec : sum ] summarizes all results .",
    "we use in our study the multi - gaussian expansion method described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the technique basically consists of decomposing the luminosity into a number of concentric two - dimensional ( 2d ) gaussians . by fitting the detailed surface brightness distribution",
    ", the mge formalism provides a description of the intrinsic luminosity density , which converts to the mass distribution via the assumed constant @xmath0 . from galaxy images this formalism allows us to generate realistic initial conditions for our n - body simulations using the method explained in sec  [ sec : nbody ] .",
    "the mge parametrization is also the first and crucial step of the jam modeling .",
    "thus , a rigorous and robust approach is needed when producing the mge model of a galaxy , as the predicted kinematics may significantly depend on the obtained mass distribution ( see sec  [ sec : jam ] ) .",
    "the method and software we adopt in our study to produce mge parametrization is fully described in @xcite .",
    "once the best fit has been found , we have a description of the galaxy surface brightness distribution given as a sum of two - dimensional gaussians which we can attempt to deproject .",
    "the deprojection of a galaxy surface brightness distribution is formally non - unique for all but edge - on cases , and the degeneracy can become severe at low inclinations @xcite .",
    "the mge method provides just _",
    "one _ solution for the deprojection , in terms of a sum of three - dimensional gaussians .",
    "this method has been intensively used and usually provides luminosity distributions consistent with observed photometry of existing galaxies , but the mge method obviously does not remove the existing intrinsic degeneracy .",
    "the deprojection of an mge model can be done analytically once the viewing angles are known ( see * ? ? ?",
    "when the system is assumed to be axisymmetric , only one viewing angle , the inclination @xmath11 ( @xmath12 for an edge - on system ) , is sufficient to retrieve the full three - dimensional luminosity distribution @xmath13 ( if the galaxy is not face - on ) .    in a coordinate system @xmath14 centered on the galaxy nucleus with _",
    "z _ pointing toward us and @xmath15 being the plane of the sky , the mge surface brightness can be written as : @xmath16}\\ ] ] where n is the number of adopted gaussian components , each having an integrated luminosity @xmath17 , an observed axial ratio @xmath18 , a dispersion @xmath19 along the major axis , and a position angle ( pa ) @xmath20 measured counter - clockwise from @xmath21 to the major - axis of the gaussian , with @xmath22 being the associated rotated coordinate system .",
    "then , the deprojected mge luminosity distribution in cylindrical coordinates can be expressed as :    @xmath23}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath24-th gaussian has the total luminosity @xmath17 , intrinsic axial ratio @xmath25 and dispersion @xmath26 ( in the present study @xmath27 ) the intrinsic axial ratio @xmath25 can then be written as    @xmath28    where @xmath11 is the galaxy inclination .",
    "the fitting of the mge to the photometry follows the procedure applied by @xcite ( see their fig .  2 ) to deal with the presence of bars . this same approach is being applied to the mge fits of the atlas@xmath9  sample ( scott et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the procedure allows to find the best fit to the photometry , maximizing the minimum @xmath29 and minimizing the maximum @xmath29 , while still being consistent with the projected galaxy image within the errors . for near face - on cases ,",
    "a small deviation in the observed axis ratios implies an important change in the flatness ( or roundness ) of the mass distribution .",
    "as the previous procedure frequently ends with very similar lower and upper limits for @xmath29 , we force a common axis ratio for all gaussians for such cases to keep an acceptable global shape for our mge model .",
    "when the bar clearly affects the projected photometry of our models ( i.e. , when it is easily detected ) , the method adopted for the mge parametrization consists in forcing the lower and upper limit of the gaussian axis ratios . in this context",
    ", a bar can be considered as a perturbation of a disk structure .",
    "bars , if fully fitted by mge components , appear as gaussians elongated along the apparent long axis of the bar .",
    "the presence of a bar tends to significantly affect the @xmath29 values of a few gaussians depending on its position angle , strength and length ( the position angle of the bar pa@xmath30 being measured counter - clockwise from the projected major - axis of the galaxy ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath29 could thus make the system look flatter ( or rounder ) than the corresponding axisymmetric case if the bar is seen end - on ( resp .",
    "side - on ) .",
    "previous tests made in @xcite showed that the best fitting mge parametrization of a barred galaxy is usually not the one which allows the best fit to the observed kinematics ( using jam models ) .",
    "the kinematic fit is significantly improved when the gaussians have constrained axial ratios such that the systems is forced to an axisymmetric  bar - less  mge parametrization . as bars often only affect the photometry within a restricted radial range , we use the outer disk of each galaxy to constrain the imposed value of the gaussian flattening .",
    "figure  [ fig : mges ] gives two examples of the resulting mge fits for an axisymmetric simulation and a barred simulation , both including large - scale disks .",

    "the jam technique allows for a different m / l and anisotropy for each individual mge gaussian component .",
    "however , the measurement of a global mass for real galaxies does not seem to require this extra generality , at least within 1@xmath38 , where good quality integral - field data are available ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and paper  i ) .",

    "we also made static realisations of a few ( hernquist and one typical axisymmetric lenticular ) mass models , and thus only used the initial realisation of the n - body distribution .",

    "starting from the mge parametrization of a mass distribution ( after taking into account the mass - to - light ratio @xmath0 ) , the initial positions of the particles can be computed easily .",

    "values for these ratios can be set individually for each gaussian component , but in this study all gaussians share the same geometry of its velocity dispersion ellipsoid .",

    "the number of particles and the time evolution of each model are given in table  [ tab : model_simu ] .",

    "the inclination was recovered within an error of less than @xmath66 ( besides the case of @xmath62 , for which the inclination is meaningless ) , the global anisotropy was accurately recovered within an error of @xmath67 and the error on @xmath0 never exceeded @xmath68    we then considered a more realistic numerical test , using the mge parametrization of the sdss @xmath69-band image of the real galaxy ngc4754 and a constant anisotropy and we label this model @xmath45 .",
    "when computing the particle velocities , we forced @xmath70 for all gaussians .",
    "in contrast to the above - mentioned hernquist models , @xmath45 represents a complex multi - component object in terms of its mass distribution and kinematics , and is therefore expected to be more challenging for the jam modeling method .",
    "we also built two simulations , respectively based on the mge parametrizations of ngc4570 and ngc4179 , which were evolved via n - body simulations during 1.5gyr ( the face - on and edge - on projections of the final state are illustrated in [ fig : simu_final ] ) .",
    "these two simulations can be considered as fully relaxed , and contrarily to @xmath45 and the hernquist models , the resulting @xmath43 is measured not to be constant with radius .",
    "one important difference between @xmath71 and @xmath72 is that , while the initial conditions for @xmath71 were fixed as isotropic ( @xmath73 ) , the ones for @xmath72 were those of a dynamically cold disk as described in table  [ tab : model_simu ] .",
    "no bar formed either for @xmath72 or @xmath71 .    projected velocity and velocity dispersion maps of our two axisymmetric simulations with variable @xmath43 are presented in figure  [ fig : panel ] .",
    "the second velocity moment is dominated by the dispersion in the central region , and by the velocity in the outer parts .",
    "the profile of @xmath37 also shows a central depletion .    figure  [ fig : betamap ] present the local anisotropy @xmath43 as measured in the meridional plane and the equatorial plane , computed on a cylindrical grid with linearly spaced cells in @xmath74 , in @xmath75 and in angle @xmath76 where ( @xmath74,@xmath76,@xmath75 ) are the standard cylindrical coordinates , including a central cylindrical cell with a radius of @xmath77kpc .",
    "this highlights the fact the anisotropy is not constant in our axisymmetric simulations and that the central parts are more isotropic than the outer regions . in figure",
    "[ fig : br ] , we show that the radial anisotropy profile ( which is simply the azimuthal average of the equatorial computation ) generally increases outwards for these axisymmetric simulations .        .",
    "we also developed bar simulations , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , based on the initial mge parametrizations of ngc4442 and ngc4754 , respectively : these are the final state of two n - body simulations after 1.5  gyr of evolution ( face - on and edge - on projections of the final state can be found in [ fig : simu_final ] ) . to generate a bar ,",
    "we force a cold dynamical structure in the initial particle realisations by setting in the initial conditions @xmath80 .",

    "@xmath78 presents the biggest bar ( in size ) of our simulations : we estimate a semi - major axis of 3.0kpc .",
    "the size of the bar is determined using the radial flattening ( @xmath81 ) and the position angle ( @xmath82 ) of isophotes as done in @xcite .",
    "basically we define the end of the bar as the radius where isophotes are nearly round ( @xmath83 ) combined with an important change in the position angle . using the same method we determine the semi - major axis of the bar for @xmath79 to be 2.2  kpc . outside of the bar regions ,",
    "our two simulations are characterized by a rotation pattern consistent with an axisymmetric disk - like system .",
    "the velocity fields of our barred simulations are shown in the two lower panels of figure  [ fig : panel ] .",
    "as for the axisymmetric cases , the @xmath37 maps are dominated by velocity dispersion in the central parts and by the mean velocity in the outer parts .",
    "but in contrast to the @xmath72 and @xmath45 simulations , the barred simulations all show a peak in the center of the @xmath37 maps .",
    "this apparent difference between the barred and unbarred cases has important consequences , since this will condition the fit of the projected second velocity moment via a jam model .",
    "figure  [ fig : betamap ] and figure  [ fig : br ] show that the local anisotropy starts from a central value of 0.3 , reaching a minimum of nearly 0.2 close to the end of the bar , then increasing in the outer parts of the model up to 0.7 .",
    "the derivation of @xmath43 in the equatorial plane confirms the presence of a drop in @xmath43 in the outer parts of the bar .      as input for the jam modeling , we simulated observations by projecting our simulations first with four different inclinations : @xmath84 ; @xmath85 ; @xmath86 and @xmath87 , ( @xmath88 corresponding to the face - on projection , and @xmath12 to the edge - on projection ) .",
    "the choice of a near edge - on projection instead of an exact edge - on projection was motivated by the goal of checking the accuracy of the inclination recovery .",
    "indeed the edge - on projection does not allow an overestimation of @xmath11 and then limits the range of possible uncertainty .",
    "when a bar is present , we also used four different position angles for the bar , and this for each value of the inclination : pa@xmath89 ; pa@xmath90 ; pa@xmath91 and pa@xmath92 .",
    "the position angle of the bar is measured counter - clockwise from the galaxy projected major - axis to the bar major - axis , so that pa@xmath92 is close to having the bar end - on and pa@xmath89 close to side - on .",

    "then , the jam modeling was fit on a @xmath96 pixels map ( @xmath97  arcsec ) of the second velocity moment with the simulated galaxy centered on its nucleus , as this roughly corresponds to the setup for a single sauron exposure .    ) for axisymmetric simulations ( @xmath72 and @xmath71 ) and barred simulations ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",

    "the difference between all profiles is too small to allow a good recovery of @xmath43 at such low inclination .",
    "[ fig : betadeg ] ]",
    "the recovery of @xmath11 , @xmath43 and @xmath0 with jam is done on @xmath37 maps only .",
    "the prediction of @xmath36 and @xmath99 require an extra assumption on the constancy of the tangential anisotropy of the jam models .",
    "this assumption may not be well verified in the simulations , especially in barred ones . however , the accuracy in the determination of the above parameters only depends on the ability of jam to reproduce the @xmath37 , and not the @xmath36 and @xmath99 fields separately .",
    "details of the method to calculate @xmath36 and @xmath99 can be found in @xcite .      as shown in figure  [ fig : br ]",
    "the anisotropy varies significantly when going from the inner to the outer parts of our simulations .",
    "the jam modelling method allows for a different anisotropy @xmath43 for every individual mge gaussian . here",
    "we limit ourselves to the simple case where @xmath43 is constant for the whole model .",
    "tests using 25 real galaxies @xcite have shown that even with constant anisotropy the recovered @xmath0 agrees with the one derived with schwarzschild models , which allow for a general anisotropy distribution .",
    "the extra generality of jam is therefore not required in this case .",
    "thus , for comparison , we compute a global anisotropy for our simulations by doing a luminosity - weighted average of the local anisotropy for all of our simulations . in the following",
    "we discuss the issue of the inclination - anisotropy degeneracy intrinsic to galaxy dynamics and also the important influence of the mge parametrization on the recovery of the global anisotropy .",
    "the global anisotropy recovered with the jam modeling method is noted @xmath100 and the one computed directly from the simulation @xmath101 .      as shown in @xcite and with more galaxies in @xcite",
    "there is an intrinsic degeneracy in the dynamical problem between the recovery of the inclination and the anisotropy : given the observed photometry , the observed kinematics can be reproduced in detail for a wide range of inclinations , by varying the orbital make up of the models .",
    "this degeneracy persists even in the restricted case in which the anisotropy is assumed to be constant for the whole galaxy @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy can only be broken by making empirically - motivated assumptions on the anisotropy .",
    "this was the approach adopted by @xcite , who showed using a small sample of galaxies that , if @xmath43 is assumed to be positive , as determined using general models on large samples of galaxies @xcite , the correct inclination can be recovered from the observed integral - field kinematics .",
    "here we test the inclination recovery via jam using n - body simulations of both unbarred ( i.e. @xmath72 and @xmath71 ) and in particular barred galaxies ( i.e. @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) , for which the inclination is known .",
    "we confirm the fact that , despite the inclination - anisotropy degeneracy the inclination can be recovered in axisymmetric simulations , and we additionally find that the inclination can be recovered even in barred simulations .",
    "the influence of @xmath11 on the second velocity moment map is important at low inclination .",
    "a slight change in the inclination implies a significant change in @xmath37 ( which is more directly related to the change in the axis ratio ) , and then allows a good recovery of the inclination value @xmath11 . at higher inclination , the change in ellipticity is milder and @xmath37 is less influenced by small variations . in all cases ,",
    "the uncertainty never exceeds a few degrees , even when the fit can be considered difficult due to the presence of non - axisymmetric features such as a bar .",
    "we also confirm that at low inclinations ( @xmath102 ) there is a degeneracy in anisotropy in the @xmath37 fit , essentially preventing any information on the anisotropy from being extracted from the data in that case .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : betadeg ] , changes induced by the anisotropy parameter on the @xmath37 profiles are not significant for @xmath103 .",

    "is recovered within 3% for a pa@xmath119 , which represents the average for random orientations .",
    "however the bias in the recovery can reach up to 15% in our tests cases .",
    "but the main point is that the recovered @xmath0 is correlated with the position angle of the bar , pa@xmath30 .",
    "the more the bar is seen end - on , the larger the overestimation , due to the larger velocities of the stars moving along the bar , and towards the line - of - sight , with respect to the other directions in the disk plane .",

    "( see fig  [ fig : mge_deproj_bis ] ) , following the axisymmetric assumption , the jam model is unable to reproduce the global shape of the @xmath37 map ( see fig  [ fig : jam_4442_45]-  [ fig : jam_4442_87 ] , fig  [ fig : jam_4754_45]-  [ fig : jam_4754_87 ] top left panel ) .",
    "the error on the recovered mass - to - light ratio can be up to @xmath121 . in fact the global shape of the @xmath37 map is dictated by the global anisotropy .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio essentially adjusts the fit to the global level of the second velocity moment .",
    "the position of the bar pa@xmath90 is a useful reference , as it represents the average value for random orientations .",
    "as previously mentioned in this case the mge parametrization is hardly affected by pa@xmath30 . in this configuration",
    "the error on @xmath0 does not exceed 3% , although the @xmath37 map is not reproduced . basically for projections with pa@xmath122 @xmath0",
    "is expected to be underestimated while for projections with pa@xmath123 it is overestimated .",
    "then for pa@xmath91 and pa@xmath92 , the bar produces a vertically elongated structure in projection and an artificially round bulge when deprojected as an axisymmetric system .",
    "however the reproduction of the @xmath37 shape is still a hard task for the jam model ( see fig  [ fig : jam_4442_45]-  [ fig : jam_4442_87 ] , fig  [ fig : jam_4754_45]-  [ fig : jam_4754_87 ] right column ) .",
    "a brief investigation pertaining to the influence of the mge parametrization on @xmath120 , illustrated by figure  [ fig : mlqbounds ] , shows that forcing the flattening of the mass distribution in the jam model does not really affect @xmath120 , except for pa@xmath92 . for this bar position the accuracy in @xmath120",
    "is increased , but at the same time , as previously mentioned in section  [ sec : beta ] , the accuracy on the recovered global anisotropy is decreased .",
    "the prediction of the @xmath36 and @xmath99 fields , are however significantly improved , when forcing @xmath25 , is as already shown in figure  3 of @xcite .    to sum up , when a bar is present the @xmath0 overestimation or underestimation with the jam modelling method are clearly due : ( i ) to the fact that the mass is incorrectly deprojected as too flat or too round , when the bar is edge - on or side - on respectively ; and ( ii ) to the fact that the projected second moments are lower or higher when the bar is edge - on or side - on respectively .    ]    to reduce the effect of the bar , one possible solution is to fit the jam model only to regions where the bar has little or no influence .",
    "we therefore investigated the effect of the size of the field of view ( fov ) on @xmath120 .",
    "one could expect that when increasing the fov further we could minimize the effect of the bar on the fit and thus reach a better accuracy in the recovering operation . to test this ,",
    "we increased the fov of our mock data and repeated the jam fitting procedure ( the mge parametrization was not affected as it is anyway done on a projection of the simulations with a very large field of view ) . figure  [ fig : fov ] illustrates @xmath120 as a function of the size of one side of the fov normalized by the size of the bar for @xmath79 .",
    "we find that , as expected , the fov plays a role in the recovered values .",
    "when the size of the fov exceeds the bar size @xmath124 decreases and seems to tend to a limit value .",
    "this is expected as we can not totally get rid of the effect of the bar in the @xmath37 maps . in our study , the typical fitted field of view is quite comparable to the size of the bar itself , meaning that our previous results are close to the worst case scenario .",
    "the relative size of the bar with respect to the size of the field of view is an important ingredient for the recovery of the mass - to - light ratio .    to conclude , when modeling a barred galaxy assuming an axisymmetric mass distribution , the @xmath0 is on average ( at pa@xmath119 ) still well recovered .",
    "it can , however , be overestimated , when the bar is parallel to the line - of - sight , or overestimated , when the bar is orthogonal to the line - of - sight , by up to 15% ( in our tests ) .",
    "the amplitude of these errors mainly depend on the position angle of the bar pa@xmath30 , but also on the size of the fov . excluding the most central parts and increasing",

    "this paper focuses on the study of the possible biases in the @xmath0 and anisotropy determination for barred simulations , when using axisymmetric dynamical models .",
    "this extends previous studies @xcite of triaxial and prolate merger remnants to axisymmetric and barred simulated disk galaxies that better resemble observed fast early - type rotators which constitute the large majority of the gas - poor population in the nearby universe ( see paper  ii and paper  iii ) .",
    "we do this by generating n - body simulations of objects with properties similar to observed galaxies , both with and without bars .",
    "these are projected at various viewing angles and used to generate mock observations that closely resemble real data .",
    "these data are then fed into the jam modeling machinery as for real data , the difference being that the intrinsic values of the free jam model parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath43 , @xmath0 ) are known for the simulated data set .    the errors in the recovered inclination increase with inclination due to the fact that , as previously noticed , the models predictions are sensitive to the intrinsic axial ratio of the mge models .",
    "this implies that for nearly face - on inclinations , where the intrinsic axial ratio of the models change rapidly , the inclination is formally constrained to a fraction of a degree .",
    "this formal accuracy is , however , compensated by a broader degeneracy in the mass deprojection , leading to a small _ negative _ bias in the inclination . in practice ,",
    "for the four simulations we constructed ( 40 different projections in total ) , the errors never exceeded 5@xmath126 .",
    "we confirm previous results that the @xmath0 can be recovered within a few percent when the simulated galaxies are nearly axisymmetric , except for nearly face - on view ( @xmath127 ) , for which the @xmath0 can be significantly overestimated .",
    "the global anisotropy @xmath43 can be difficult to recover , especially at low inclination ( near face - on ) due to the inclination - anisotropy degeneracy .",
    "this degeneracy implies a significant uncertainty on @xmath43 at low inclination , but a smaller error at high inclination .",
    "the global anisotropy is primarily influenced by the flattening ( or the roundness ) of the mge parametrization of the projected luminosity . in the case of regular axisymmetric objects ,",
    "the main issue is the intrinsic mathematical degeneracy of the luminosity deprojection at low inclination , which affects any axisymmetric deprojection method , including the adopted mge one .",
    "this results in small deviations of the recovered global anisotropy from the value computed from the numerical simulations : @xmath43 is well recovered .    when a bar is present , the mass deprojection becomes the main uncertainty in the models .",
    "the deprojected axisymmetric model will be naturally different from the true non - axisymmetric barred distribution and will change as a function of the observed pa .",
    "consequently the predicted @xmath37 of the models , as well as the corresponding best fitting @xmath43 will change as a function of the pa and can be quite different from the true axially - averaged value .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is less sensitive to the mge parametrization than the global anisotropy , but it is biased due to the intrinsic dynamics of the system we want to model .",
    "we find that @xmath0 is mainly influenced by the position of the bar and the size of the field of view .",
    "the error depends upon the position angle of the bar pa@xmath30 and can be up to 15% . including only regions",
    "far from the bar allows a reduction of the error , but can not generally avoid it completely .",
    "our study provides an estimate of the @xmath0 error that can affect the determination of dynamical @xmath0 via axisymmetric models , and in particular using the jam method .",
    "the large variety of possible shapes , sizes and orientations of bars in galaxies , each with specific dynamics , prevents us from quantifying the exact errors made for individual galaxies .",
    "one should also keep in mind that our study is done on simulations of relatively weak bars .",
    "therefore , the error on the estimated @xmath0 when modelling galaxies exhibiting stronger bars is expected to be larger .",

    "<S> we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barred galaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by trying to recover the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath0 ) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxy simulations using the jeans anisotropic multi - gaussian expansion ( jam ) method . however , given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of an axisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non - axisymmetric system and in particular to inaccuracies in the de - projected mass model , our results are relevant for general axisymmetric modelling methods . </S>",
    "<S> we run n - body collisionless simulations to build a library with various luminosity distribution , constructed to mimic real individual galaxies , with realistic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the final result of our evolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the jam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution , and we adopt a spatially constant @xmath0 and anisotropy @xmath1 distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the models are fitted to two - dimensional maps of the second velocity moments @xmath2 of the simulations for various viewing angles ( position angle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the inclination is generally well recovered by the jam models , for both barred and unbarred simulations . for unbarred simulations </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 is also accurately recovered , with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just @xmath3% when the galaxy is not too close to face on . </S>",
    "<S> at very low inclinations ( @xmath4 ) the @xmath0 can be significantly overestimated ( 9% in our tests , but errors can be larger for very face - on views ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with previous studies . for barred simulations </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 is on average ( when pa@xmath5 ) essentially unbiased , but we measure an over / under estimation of up to @xmath6% in our tests . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the @xmath0 bias depends on the position angle of the bar as expected : overestimation occurs when the bar is closer to end - on , due to the increased stellar motion along the line - of - sight , and underestimation otherwise . for unbarred simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the jam models are able to recover the mean value of the anisotropy with bias @xmath7 , within the region constrained by the kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> however when a bar is present , or for nearly face - on models , the recovered anisotropy varies wildly , with biases up to @xmath8 .    </S>",
