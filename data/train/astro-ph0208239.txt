    "the variability of sagittarius ( sgr ) a * at x - ray wavelengths @xcite has bolstered the case for associating this source with the suspected 2.6 x 10@xmath0 m@xmath1black hole at the center of our galaxy @xcite . in two chandra observations separated by almost a year and having a total of 76 ksec of exposure time ,",
    "sgr a * was detected at x - ray wavelengths for the first time and was also seen to flare in intensity over a time scale of 3 hours @xcite . while the flare s short duration implied a small region of origin , @xmath4400 r@xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the schwarzschild radius = 2gm@xmath8/c@xmath9 ) , its large amplitude , a factor of 50 , has raised the possibility of detecting corresponding intensity enhancements at wavelengths outside the x - ray regime .",
    "existing models for sgr a * s flared state make very disparate predictions for the emission at wavelengths between the x - ray and radio regimes @xcite .",
    "the wide differences between these models are a result of assuming different geometries ( disk vs. jet ) and emission mechanisms for the flaring process ( e.g. , enhanced accretion rates vs. magnetic reconnection ) . in some models ,",
    "the predicted emission in the flared state , at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths , dramatically exceeds that of existing detection limits @xcite .",
    "for example , the preferred model of @xcite predicts an observed 2  flux density of @xmath513 mjy , or a dereddened flux density of @xmath5300 mjy , during the flared state .",
    "unlike the situation at radio wavelengths , where long - term monitoring campaigns have been used to constrain the flared state of sgr a * @xcite , the limited time coverage and spatial resolution of published ir experiments prevent meaningful constraints on the flared state s ir emission from being inferred and , thus , the reported limits are assumed to be associated with sgr a * s quiescent state .",
    "the w. m. keck observatory dynamical study of stars in the central stellar cluster @xcite provides a rich source of high angular resolution 2  data between 1995 and 2001 . in this paper",
    ", we present 2  flux density limits from maps that were each composed of data from a single night .",
    "the elapsed time of 3 - 4 hours in each map is approximately the same as the time scale of the observed x - ray flare , making this data set ideally suited for possibly detecting a flare of this type .",
    "given the quantity of these observations , our non - detections establish a robust upper limit for the flared state s 2  emission intensity .",
    "high resolution , near - infrared observations of the galactic center were conducted from 1995 june to 2001 july using both speckle and adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging techniques on the keck 10-m telescopes . the speckle observations were obtained in the k - band ( @xmath10 = 2.2 , @xmath11=0.4 ) using the keck i facility near - infrared camera ( nirc ; @xcite ) with external re - imaging optics .",
    "this resulted in a pixel scale of 00203 and a field of view ( fov ) of 512@xmath12512 @xcite . during each night of observations several thousand short exposures ( t@xmath13= 0.137 sec )",
    "were taken in sets of @xmath5200 .",
    "a more limited set of data was collected using two different science cameras behind the keck ii ao system @xcite .",
    "the first ao data set was collected in the k-band ( @xmath10 = 2.1 , @xmath11=0.35 ) in early 1999 with the near - infrared engineering camera ( kcam ; @xcite ) , which had a pixel scale of 00175 , a fov of 44@xmath1244 .",
    "each image had an exposure time of 5 sec .",
    "the slit - viewing camera of nirspec ( scam ; @xcite ) provided a second set of ao images for this study .",
    "these images , like the speckle images , were made in the k - band and have a pixel scale of 00170 and a fov of 44@xmath1244 , and exposure time of 10 sec .",
    "usno 0600 - 28579500 served as the natural guide star for all of these ao observations . since this guide star is both faint ( r = 13.2 ) and distant from the target ( r@xmath530 ) , the ao performance was non - optimal .",
    "table [ datesobs ] provides a summary of all observations .",
    "three basic steps constitute the data analysis process in this program .",
    "first , high angular resolution maps are generated from the individual short exposure frames (  [ construction ] ) .",
    "second , all point sources in the fov are identified and a direct detection of sgr a * is ruled out (  [ i d ] ) .",
    "third , limits for sgr a * are derived from the residual maps , in which all identified point sources have been removed (  [ limits ] ) .",
    "image processing proceeds similarly to that carried out for the dynamical experiment with one exception .",
    "rather than combining all the data from the duration of an observing run , typically 2 - 3 nights , we synthesize the data over each night to produce 27 maps , each of which is limited to an elapsed time of 3 - 4 hours .",
    "since the details of this method are described elsewhere @xcite , only a brief summary is provided here .",
    "standard image reduction techniques are applied to all the individual speckle and ao frames . for the speckle data , a two",
    "stage shift - and - add ( saa ; @xcite ) analysis then produces the final high resolution maps .",
    "in the first stage , the 200 frames in each set are combined to form an intermediate saa image .",
    "then , these multiple intermediate saa images ( from throughout the night ) are combined to form one final saa map .",
    "this allows each intermediate image to be examined for seeing quality . in combining the intermediate images ,",
    "a seeing cut is established so as to exclude those images with the worst seeing from the final map . for the ao data ,",
    "this cut is also carried out on the individual ao images before they are registered and averaged together .",
    "figure [ maps ] displays representative final nightly speckle and ao maps .      in all maps ,",
    "stars are identified using starfinder , an idl package developed for astrometry and photometry in crowded stellar fields @xcite .",
    "this package iteratively generates estimates of the point spread function ( psf ) from a few selected bright stars and then identifies point sources over the entire fov through cross - correlation of the map with the psf model . for the psf extraction",
    ", we found that the most reliable psf models are obtained with a support size of @xmath52 , which represents a compromise between needing to accommodate the large psf halos and yet having a limited fov .",
    "this choice limits our analysis to images with psf halo sizes of 04 or less , as the psfs of the remaining two images are poorly characterized by this process .",
    "the psf model is based on four of the five brightest stars in the fov ( irs 16ne , 16c , 16nw , and 29n ; see figure [ maps ] ) ; irs 16sw is avoided as a psf model star , since it is surrounded by relatively bright stars in its immediate vicinity . for point source identification , a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 between the psf model and the actual stellar image",
    "is required to avoid spurious detections .",
    "this process results in the identification of @xmath5100 point sources in each map .",
    "the speckle and ao images have significantly different psfs .",
    "nonetheless , both psfs are composed of a compact core on top of a broader halo .",
    "table [ datesobs ] provides the characterization of the psf in each map based on the radial profile of the psf model .",
    "while the speckle images have psf core fwhm that are nearly diffraction limited ( @xmath5005 ) and @xmath540% smaller than that of the ao images ( @xmath5008 ) , the ao psf core contains @xmath530% of the total energy , @xmath512 times more than the typical speckle psf .    at this stage in the analysis , it is possible to look for direct detections of sgr a*. we use proper motion acceleration vectors @xcite to pinpoint the central black hole s position relative to the nominal radio position of sgr a * @xcite to within 004 ( 1@xmath14 ) . within 008 of this location , 4 sources ( 13.9  @xmath15  k  @xmath15  16.5 ) are identified , all of which were previously detected in `` monthly '' maps made from all data in a single observing run @xcite and , furthermore , have significant proper motions .",
    "this high stellar density emphasizes the need for improved accuracy in sgr a * s position in the ir reference frame in order to measure or constrain its emission . with no stationary source identified in this region , we conclude that sgr a * has not been detected .      in order to determine an accurate detection limit at the position of sgr a * , it is necessary to remove the contaminating seeing halos from nearby sources .",
    "a ` stars only ' map is created using the psf model and list of stars generated by starfinder .",
    "this is then subtracted from the original map , producing a residual map . with the residual map , a 3@xmath14 point source detection limit for sgr a *",
    "is established based on three times the rms of 25 aperture photometry values , which are calculated using @xmath560 mas radius apertures and sky annuli extending from @xmath560 mas to @xmath590 mas .",
    "the 5@xmath125 grid of apertures in the residual map corresponds to an area of @xmath506@xmath1206 , more than two orders of magnitude larger than the uncertainty in the location of sgr a*.    zero points are obtained through carrying out the same aperture photometry in the original maps ( prior to the ` stars only ' subtraction ) on all known non - variable sources brighter than k=10.5,using the flux densities reported in @xcite , and that occur in more than 30% of the frames for each night .",
    "the photometric calibration sources used are irs 16nw , 16c , 16cc , and 16ne , when the fov allows its inclusion ; irs 29n is omitted as it is found to be marginally variable at the 2@xmath14 level .",
    "typical photometric zero point 1@xmath14 uncertainties of @xmath50.04 mag result from this procedure .",
    "table [ datesobs ] and figure [ magvstime ] contain the resulting 3@xmath14 point source detection limits for sgr a*. the lowest of these upper limits gives an observed limit for the quiescent state of sgr a * of 0.09@xmath30.005 mjy , or , equivalently , a dereddened value of 2.0@xmath30.1 mjy , while the highest limit constrains our analysis of the variable state of sgr a * to @xmath40.8 mjy ( observed ) or 19 mjy ( dereddened ) .",
    "although these upper limits vary significantly from epoch to epoch ( due to variable observing conditions and/or a variation in the number of contaminating sources detected and removed ) the lowest of them is lower than the best previously reported limits at 2   for sgr a * s quiescent state ( dereddened 4 mjy ; @xcite ) by a factor of 2 .",
    "using the coverage of the x - ray and near - infrared experiments and assuming random 3-hr flaring events that produce both enhanced x - ray and near - infrared emission , we consider the likelihood that a near - infrared flare in excess of our weakest limit occurred over the course of the ir experiment .",
    "the probability of seeing such a flare is given by the following binomial distribution : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the probability of detecting a flare in one trial and @xmath18 is the probability of no detection ( 1-@xmath17 ) . here",
    "we will refer to @xmath17 as the duty cycle and note that in our context , this quantity describes what fraction of a set of 3-hr images should contain a flare .",
    "figure [ duty_cycle ] shows the probability distributions as a function of underlying duty cycle for both the x - ray experiment , in which @xmath19=1 and @xmath20=7.6 ( obtained by dividing the total time , 76 ksec , by the length of the observed x - ray flare , 10 ksec ) and the near - infrared experiment , in which @xmath19=0 and n=25 . the x - ray and near - infrared probability distributions",
    "have only a small overlap , which suggests that if the flaring activity at x - ray and near - infrared wavelengths are coupled , a flare most likely occurred during the near - infrared experiment .",
    "the joint probability distribution quantifies this and suggests there is , at most , a probability of 9% of a random 3-hr near - infrared flare in excess of 19 mjy ( dereddened ) .",
    "we therefore assume that at the 2@xmath14 confidence level , a flare occurred during our experiment and use our limits to constrain the variability models .",
    "while only a limited amount of modeling of the recent 3-hr x - ray flare detected at sgr a * has been carried out , existing models predict 2  dereddened emission as high as 300 mjy in the model preferred by @xcite but as small as 0.4 mjy in @xcite .",
    "the former model explains the elevated x - ray emission , produced by synchrotron self - compton , by an enhanced temperature for the relativistic electron population , as might arise in a magnetic reconnection event . on the other hand ,",
    "liu & melia present a flare model in which the flare arises due to an enhanced accretion rate and bremsstrahlung emission is dominant at both near - infrared and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the lack of a near - infrared detection of sgr a * makes the @xcite model and any other mechanism that produces flared 2  emission in excess of 19 mjy ( dereddened ) unlikely .",
    "this paper summarizes a search for a near - infrared counterpart to sgr a * in the flared state . from the length of our observations , this search was sensitive to variability on time scales of 3 hours .",
    "no such counterpart was detected .",
    "however , by identifying and removing all the stars in the crowded inner @xmath506@xmath1206 of the galactic center , an upper limit for the emission from sgr a * has been inferred for each observation epoch .",
    "these limits constrain the quiescent emission from sgr a * to @xmath40.09 mjy ( 2.0 mjy , dereddened ) and the variable component to @xmath40.8 mjy ( 19 mjy , dereddened ) at the 2@xmath14 confidence level .",
    "more x - ray data will improve the estimated flaring duty cycle and is likely to increase the confidence level of our limits for the near - infrared component of the flared emission .",
