    "as mentioned earlier this similarity is , probably , due to the fact that the potential @xmath0 can be considered in one dimension as a relatively short ranged.@xcite    to obtain equilibrium ( static ) density and velocity profiles we assume no time dependence in ( [ eq : forced_rh_main ] ) and obtain , @xmath39 which is the equation of a `` circle '' in the phase space ( @xmath40 ) plane @xmath41    the constant in ( [ eq : circle_eq ] ) depends on @xmath42 and can be easily determined using ( [ eq : rho1h],[eq : rho2h ] ) along with ( [ eq : m12def ] ) .",

    "the analytical expressions for momenta ( [ eq : k1c],[eq : k2c ] ) and the analytical expressions for charge density ( [ eq : rct ] ) and spin density ( [ eq : rst ] ) are the main results of this section .",
    "we see that in terms of phase space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - space - picture - for ] ) the system can be described by two circles of different radii .",
    "the radii depend on the coupling strength @xmath8 and the numbers of particles @xmath37 and @xmath38 as can be seen from ( [ eq : k1c],[eq : k2c ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with an exclusion statistics picture@xcite so that the particle with spin up occupies the area @xmath65 in the phase space while in the domain where both spin up and spin down particles are present the area is @xmath64 per @xmath66 particles . in the limit @xmath67 ( free fermions ) the inner circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - space - picture - for ] is filled with double density compared to the annulus region between the inner and outer circles .",
    "this is reflected as a bump feature for the charge density ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : charge ] ) . in the limit of a very strong repulsion @xmath68 the particles are mutually exclusive with the phase - space area",

    "we notice here that the size of the cloud @xmath70 given by the support of ( [ eq : rct ] ) grows with @xmath8 ( 1d gas expands when @xmath8 increases ) . we have taken this main dependence into account by plotting density as a function of re - scaled coordinate @xmath51 .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the bump in charge density profile disappears in the limit of a very strong repulsion , the analogous feature in the spin - density profile is present for any @xmath8 .",

    "indeed , the physical origin of the bump feature is transparent for noninteracting fermions .",
    "it comes just from a superposition of densities of clouds of different size .",
    "we expect that the repulsive interaction smears the bump feature making sure that the particles of different species avoid each other similarly to the pauli exclusion of particles of the same species . indeed ,",
    "recent calculations of charge density profiles for fermions with contact interactions by ma and yang @xcite give results very similar ( qualitatively ) to the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : charge ] . it would be interesting to check whether the dip in the spin density profile does not disappear with an increase of the repulsion strength in the model of ref . .",
    "the following comment is in order . as the origin of the bump feature in the equilibrium charge density profile",
    "can be traced to the model of noninteracting fermions , this feature is generic and should be observed also in three - dimensional harmonic traps which are widely used in cold atom experiments .",
    "indeed , the superposition of two ellipsoid - like clouds of spin - up and spin - down particles will give the bump in the overall number density of atoms .",
    "the repulsive interaction will smear the feature while the attractive one will amplify it .    to manipulate cold atom systems experimentally additional external potentials",
    "are often used .",
    "the gas is cooled in the presence of a harmonic trap and an additional external potential .",
    "the latter is usually created by optical means and referred to as `` knife '' .",
    "it is possible to create an external potential different for different particle species ( spin up and spin down here ) . in the following we concentrate on the potential acting only on `` charge '' degrees of freedom .",
    "we choose a knife potential of the form @xmath71 .",
    "then the static equation ( [ dt0 ] ) is modified as @xmath72 due to the inclusion of the knife ( [ dt0knife ] ) the circles in phase - space acquire peaks ( attractive knife @xmath73 ) or dips ( repulsive knife @xmath74 ) .",

    "although the solution of ( [ eq : forced_rh ] ) is not well defined beyond some time ( gradient catastrophe time ) the parametric solution ( [ eq : par_x_main],[eq : par_u_main ] ) can be formally extended beyond that time and produces multiply - valued solutions .",
