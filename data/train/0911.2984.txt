    "viruses have optimized the feat of packaging genome molecules and delivering them to the appropriate cells . in its simplest form ,",
    "a virus consists of a rigid protein shell ( capsid ) that surrounds and protects the genetic material ( either rna or dna ) from chemical and physical assaults @xcite .",
    "a viral capsid contains several copies of either one type of protein or of a few slightly different kinds . a number of _ in vitro _",
    "self - assembly experiments reveal that the protein subunits of many rna viruses can assemble spontaneously not only around their own genome but the genomes derived from other viruses and various non - viral anionic polymers .",
    "all these features in addition to their extraordinarly highly symmetric shape and monodisperse size distributions make viruses ideal structures for gene therapy , drug delivery and various nanotechnology and material science applications @xcite . to this end ,",
    "the number of experiments and theoretical research aimed at understanding the physical basis of assembly of viruses and the factors influencing the structure and size of viral capsids is amazingly soaring @xcite .    the majority of viral capsids have either spherical or elongated structures .",
    "most spherical viruses have structures with icosahedral symmetry and contain @xmath0 protein subunits where @xmath1 is the structural index of viral shells and is determined from the relation @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 nonnegative integers @xcite . while the capsid protein of some viruses can form only one structure with a specific size , the capsid protein of many others are more flexible and adopt various structures with different sizes .",
    "for example , tobacco mosaic virus ( tmv ) capsid proteins assemble into tubular structures regardless of the shape and size of their cargo @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the shape of the virus is solely dictated by the intrinsic property of protein subunits . in the other end of the spectrum , many experiments show that the capsid proteins of cowpea cholorotic mosaic virus ( ccmv ) , a spherical rna virus , are able to form capsid of various size and shapes @xcite .",
    "over 35 years ago , adolph and butler@xcite and more recently lavelle _",
    "@xcite performed a series of _ in vitro _",
    "experiments with ccmv capsid proteins in the absence of rna and found that depending on the ph and ionic strength several different structures assembled . a notable feature of the constructed shape `` phase '' diagram based on these experiments is the change from an icosahedral @xmath5 structure to a cylindrical shape upon a decrease in ionic strength and an increase in ph revealing the important role of electrostatic interaction on the size and shape of empty viral shells .",
    "there have been a number of different experiments and theoretical studies @xcite to investigate the impact on the structure of capsids of the shape and length of genome . to explore the effect of cargo on the morphology of viral capsid , zlotnick and coworkers examined the assembly of capsid proteins of ccmv around heterogeneous dna longer than 500 base pairs and found that tubular structures spontaneously formed @xcite .",
    "note that ccmv has at @xmath5 icosahedral structure in its native form .",
    "quite remarkably , almost half a century ago , bancroft and coworkers ( see e.g. ref . ) demonstrated the important role of stoichiometry ratio of capsid proteins and genome in the structure of viral shells .",
    "according to their experiments ccmv capsid proteins could encapsidate tmv rnas which is about 6000 nucleotides in viral particles of various sizes . depending on the ratio of rna - protein concentrations , @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 structures can form .",
    "more recent experiments with pss ( polystyrene sulfonate , a highly flexible polyelectrolyte chain ) and ccmv capsid proteins indicate the significance of length of genome in that the size of ccmv viral shells encapsidating pss vary from 22 nm to 27 nm when the molecular weight of pss varies from 400kda to 3.4 mda @xcite .",
    "the impact of the size of cargo on the diameter of capsid is quite transparent in the experiments of dragnea and coworkers in which they found that the capsid proteins of bromo mosaic virus , another spherical plant virus , are able to package the functionalized gold nano - spherical particles of diameters of 6 , 9 and 12 nm to form virus like particles ( vlp ) with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or @xmath5 structures , respectively @xcite .",
    "all the aforementioned experiments focus on the important role of size and structure of genome and stoichiometric ratio of genome to protein in determining the structure of viral shells .",
    "however , several experimental and theoretical studies reveal that electrostatic interaction is the driving force for the assembly of capsid proteins around anionic cargos , and thus it is crucial to study the impact of cargo charge density on the structure of capsids .",
    "in fact , a careful study of several single stranded rna viruses show that there is a linear relation between the number of charges on the capsid inner surface and on their genome @xcite .",
    "an important question , then , naturally arises : could we change the size of a capsid by changing the net charge of its cargo ?",
    "more specifically , in the experiments of dragnea and coworkers with nano - spheres , does a @xmath5 structure form , if one increases the charge density of the 9 nm cores which normally form `` pseudo '' @xmath9 structures ?    in this paper , we investigate the interplay between the charge density and size of nano - cargos in virus assembly .",
    "similar to the experiments of dragnea and coworkers , we consider negatively charged nano - spheres which interact with positively charged capsid inner surface , under physiological condition and find that in addition to the diameter of the encapsidated nano - spheres , the total net charges on cargos have a significant impact on the size of viral capsids .",
    "an important feature of several rna viruses , including ccmv and bmv mentioned above , is the presence of cationic polypeptide chains that form the n - termini of the capsid protein .",
    "rich in basic amino acids , there is a total of thousands of charges on the n - terminal tails which extend into the capsid interior and are responsible for the absorption of rna to the inner capsid surface .",
    "very recent in vitro studies of aniagyei _ et al .",
    "_ reveal that a mutant of ccmv coat proteins lacking most of the n - terminal domain , @xmath10 , assemble around negatively charged 12 nm spherical cores to form @xmath9 structures @xcite .",
    "note that native ccmv proteins form a @xmath5 structure around 12 nm spherical cores .",
    "our calculations also show that the n - terminal arms can have a major impact on the virion structure and ( as shown in fig . 3 and 4 ) , they can significantly modify the free energy landscape of viral structures .",
    "one also has to consider that the deletion of the n - terminal tails might change the preferred angle between the protein subunits , an effect which is not taken into account in the present study .",
    "according to our studies , depending on the cargo charge density and the presence of n - terminal tails it might be advantageous for capsid proteins to form relatively smaller or bigger shells compared to their native structures .",
    "the effect of n - terminal on the free energy of viral capsids has been investigated previously @xcite .",
    "here we take another approach that enables us to study the energetics of complexation of proteins and core in more details .",
    "our emphasis is also on different aspects of the assembly , in particular the formation of differently sized structures depending on the conditions .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our model to calculate the free energy between capsid inner surface and a rigid sphere including the interaction of positively charged n - terminal tails with the spherical cargo . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our numerical results and in sec .",
    "iv we discuss our findings and their implications , and summarize our conclusion .",
    "here , we consider encapsidation of charged nano - particles ( whose number is @xmath11 ) within the virus capsid and the dependence of the formation free energy on the parameters describing the system .",
    "we assume that the solution consists of monovalent salt ( of bulk concentration @xmath12 ) , dissolved protein monomers ( or , more generally , basic protein subunits , which may be e.g. protein dimers as is the case for hepatitis b virus - their number is assumed to be @xmath13 ) and spherical cores that are perfectly monodisperse with respect to radius @xmath14 and surface charge density @xmath15 .",
    "all the particles are dissolved in a medium whose dielectric constant is @xmath16 ( we shall take @xmath17 , i.e. water ) .",
    "an assembly problem of this type involves many parameters , including the concentrations of cores ( @xmath18 ) and proteins ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the volume of the solution ) .",
    "these two parameters importantly influence the assembly phase diagram , in addition to the energy of the assembled complex , which is a fairly complicated quantity in itself .",
    "one can expect formation of variously sized protein capsids ( described by different caspar - klug @xmath1 numbers ) around the core , depending both on the properties of the core but also on particle concentrations ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "we shall first , however , examine the energetics of the formed complex ( capsid + core ) .",
    "in general , we shall assume that the protein charge is distributed along the flexible n - tails .",
    "we treat the tails as generic polyelectrolytes with intermonomer bondlength @xmath23 , partial charge @xmath24 per monomer , and non - electrostatic excluded volume interactions characterized by the excluded volume @xmath25 .",
    "our approach is quite similar to that exposed in ref . .",
    "the free energy of the complex in the subspace of fixed total number of polyelectrolyte monomers , @xmath26 , can be calculated from @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the lagrange multiplier enforcing the condition of fixed number of monomers , and    @xmath29 + e c^{+}(r ) \\phi(r ) - e c^{-}(r ) \\phi(r ) + p",

    "the complex free energy also depends on the salt concentration fields ( @xmath32 ) whose chemical potentials are denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "one can assume that in addition to the charge located on mobile protein tails , there is also a static density of charge , @xmath34 , which could in principle be located on the immobile parts of the capsid proteins ( outside tails ) . in the further calculations , we shall neglect the fixed charge on the capsid and assume that the static charge in the system resides exclusively on the core surface , so that @xmath35 where @xmath15 is the charge density at the core surface",
    ". the contribution of such localized charges to the electrostatic part of the free energy can be easily separated ( if required ) from the functional in the form of the boundary term as it was done in ref . .",
    "[ fig : ilustracija ] for the illustration of the system that we consider and the relevant parameters characterizing it .",
    "the variation of the free energy functional with respect to fields @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 yields two coupled partial differential equations .",
    "the first one is the generalized polyelectrolyte poisson - boltzmann equation , @xmath39 - e p \\psi(r)^2 + \\rho_p(r ) .",

    "the electrostatic boundary conditions are the same as in the standard pb theory . in particular",
    ", there is a boundary condition at @xmath44 , reflecting the finite charge density , @xmath15 at the surface of the core .",
    "there are two additional conditions that need to be specified for the density field @xmath45 .",
    "we simply take the core to be impenetrable and thus presume that @xmath46 on the inner part of the capsid one could assume that @xmath47 which means that there must be some density of the tails at the capsid wall since they are fixed or grafted .",
    "this is the only way that grafting enters our calculation .",
    "this condition signifies that in the volume @xmath48 of the spherical shell , touching the interior of the capsid with its larger radius , there should be _ one _ monomer per each of the tails in the structure . in the continuum limit",
    ", this means that the polyelectrolyte anchors to the capsid perpendicularly ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ilustracija ] ) .",
    "the procedure presented thus far is based on the mean - field description of the electrostatics of the problem and ground - state dominance ansatz for the polyelectrolyte field , see ref . for details .",
    "furthermore , the finite extensibility of the polyelectrolyte is not taken into account . while that was of no essential importance for the problem studied in ref .",
    ", it may become of importance in our case , since the protein tails are assumed to be grafted to the capsid . to take the geometrical constraints regarding the polyelectrolyte density field into account",

    "( [ eq : defin1 ] ) , one sees that we can no longer put @xmath61 , so we will be necessarily stuck with finite density of monomers at the core radius .",
    "we choose @xmath62 as the appropriate boundary conditions implying that the n - tails are _ normal _ to the surface of the inner core as well as outer capsid wall at @xmath14 and @xmath63 .",
    "in other words we assume that the chains have no overhangs at @xmath14 and @xmath63 , so that they touch both the core and the capsid only once and perpendicularly .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : anchor ] ) is automatically satisfied with such a choice .",
    "the complex free energy that we have constructed thus far accounts approximately for electrostatic energy of the system , the entropic and excluded volume effects of the confined polyelectrolyte ( protein tails ) , but also for entropic contributions of the salt ions ( on the mean - field level ) .",
    "it does not contain , however , the attractive component ( non - electrostatic ) of protein - protein interactions .",
    "these interactions consist of hydrophobic and van der waals contributions @xcite and we denote their value per protein in the complex as @xmath64 .",
    "it is this part of the energy that keeps the dominantly positively charged _ empty _ capsids together @xcite .",
    "the parameter space for assembly that we are interested needs to be at least four - dimensional ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) , presuming that the properties of the capsid proteins are kept fixed .",
    "analysis of assembly in such a high - dimensional parameter space would be highly involved .",
    "@xcite it is of interest thus to try to extract the relevant information on the assembly _ solely _ from the complex free energy , as we have defined it .",

( [ eq : condit1 ] )",
    "says that , concerning the ",
    "final  ( assembled ) state , there is no big difference with respect to the @xmath1 number of the dominantly assembled structures .",
    "the final state will always consist of all cores complexed with certain number of proteins , and the rest will be , more or less the same number of proteins that may remain isolated in the solution or perhaps form empty capsids .",
    "there will be no free ( uncomplexed ) cores in the assembled state .",
    "let us assume that prior to the assembly , the solution contains isolated charged cores and individual viral proteins ( or protein dimers or whatever the basic subunit of the assembly might be ) - this is the  initial  state . in the  initial  state ,",
    "the free energy of the system is @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the free energies per isolated protein and core in the inital state , respectively .",
    "these may in principle contain also the translational entropy contributions .",
    "after the assembly , the free energy is (  final  state ) @xmath71 the first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalf ] ) is what we can calculate - this is the free energy of the complex ( note , however , that we do not calculate the entropic term regarding the translational freedom of the assembled structures ) .",
    "the number of complexes is exactly @xmath11 since we assumed that _ all _ cores are complexed with the proteins .",
    "the second term on the rhs of eq . ( [ eq : finalf ] ) is the part of the attractive energy of proteins assembled in the complexes that is difficult to calculate .",
    "it contains the hydrophobic and van der waals protein - protein interactions , and per protein , the corresponding free energy is @xmath64 . the third term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalf ] ) is the free energy of the proteins in the final state that are _ not _ assembled in the complexes with cores ( @xmath72 of them ) .",
    "they may , however , be assembled in empty capsids .",
    "thus , in general , free energy per such protein in the final state ( @xmath73 ) is not the same as the free energy per _ isolated , individual _ protein in the initial state ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "if the proteins that do not complex with the cores indeed form aggregates ( e.g. empty capsids ) then one can expect that @xmath74 .    the system will proceed from state @xmath75 to state @xmath76 if @xmath77 .",

    ", we shall construct the quantity @xmath85 this quantity should contain the biggest part of the assembly free energy , assuming eq .",
    "( [ eq : assumption ] ) holds . in the following ,",
    "we shall term @xmath86 as the assembly free energy , and we shall refer to @xmath49 ( also denoted as @xmath87 ) as the complex free energy or the free energy of the complex .",
    "as already discussed , a prominent feature of the virus proteins assembled in a capsid are the n - tails that protrude into the capsid interior .",
    "this feature is typical for many viruses and can influence both the energetics of the protein - genome assembly @xcite and its speed .",
    "the tails are typically very positively charged , and they are thus expected to play a prominent role in the assembly of proteins with negatively charged cores . the possibility of spatial redistribution of the tails is also expected to influence the assembly , so that one can expect an interplay between the electrostatics of the tails and their configurational entropy . all of these effects are included in our free energy functional , at least approximately . in this section",
    ", we shall emphasize the electrostatic aspect of the capsid proteins and effectively neglect the tail positional degrees of freedom . in order to do so",
    ", we treat the n - tails as infinitely rigid with the vanishing intermonomer bondlength @xmath23 .",
    "the problem then reduces to electrostatic interactions only since the entropy of the n - tails is quenched . omitting the hydrophobic , vdw etc .",
    "energy of the capsid proteins , one is left with a purely electrostatic part of the total free energy .    as a first approximation one",
    "can smear the charge of the @xmath43 proteins uniformly over the external sphere of radius @xmath63 , so that its surface charge density is @xmath88 .",
    "the problem as described by this model system is stil not completely trivial as the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation describing it is of course nonlinear @xcite .",
    "however , some insight can be obtained by linearizing the pb equation and solving it in this approximation ( debye - hckel , dh ) .",
    "the details are elaborated in the appendix and the final result for the electrostatic free energy is equation ( [ eq : horrible ] ) .",
    "one can further simplify it by using @xmath89 , which is a condition typically met for the experiments done on viruses at physiological salt concentrations ( @xmath90 100 mm)@xcite . in this case , @xmath91 one should note here that the salt resides only in compartments iii and ii ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ilustracija ] ) , so there is no symmetry in the formula regarding @xmath15 , @xmath88 and @xmath14 and @xmath63 .",
    "the first term in eq . ( [ eq : fvirlim ] ) is the electrostatic self - energy of the core , and the third term is the self - energy of the protein shell .",
    "note that the self - energy of the core has a prefactor of 2 with respect to the analogous term for the protein shell .",
    "this is due to the fact that the shell is screened by the salt both from the inside and the outside , which is not the case for the impenetrable core ( note also that the dielectric constant of the core does not figure in the final equations ) .    the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : fvirlim ] is the electrostatic interaction free energy between the core and the protein shell .",
    "one easily sees that it will be minimized when @xmath15 and @xmath88 have different signs .",
    "we see that it decreases quickly as the distance between the shell and the core increases , i.e. it decreases as @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "though the dh solution enables us to study the energetics of the assembly in more details , at least numerically one needs to check its validity vs. the complete non - linear poisson - boltzmann theory , see ref . .",
    "by comparing it to the exact solution of the poisson - boltzmann equation one simultaneously checks the numerical results and the analytical formula for the dh solution .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figcomp1 ] .",
    "we have chosen the capsid parameters to approximately represent the t=3 capsid of the bmv ( brome mosaic virus ) with capsid radius @xmath63 = 16 nm .",
    "the surface charge density of the capsid @xmath88 = - 0.504 @xmath93/nm@xmath94 was obtained by smearing the 18 charges per each of the @xmath95 dimeric tails over the capsid surface .",
    "note that the absolute signs of the charge do nt matter ; what is important is that the charge on the core is of the opposite sign from the charge on the capsid .",
    "the core radius @xmath14 = 15.125 nm was chosen to be in the regime when the attractive interaction is not completely screened by salt - one can see this effect as a minimum in the free energy for some core charge density @xmath15 .",
    "this minimum disappears when the distance between the core and the capsid is larger than @xmath96 . in the chosen case ,",
    "the minimum is at @xmath97 @xmath93/nm@xmath94 .    as in the case studied in ref .",
    ", the dh results always produce larger free energies than the exact poisson - boltzmann calculation .",
    "they are of course better when the potentials in the solution are small enough , so that the linearization approximation holds - this is the case for not too large surface charge densities , and it can be clearly seen that the dh approximation fails worse as @xmath15 ( or @xmath88 ) increases , again in complete agreement with the results of ref . .",
    "having established some confidence in the dh results , we can scrutinize them a bit more closely .",
    "if one takes @xmath98 and @xmath99 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fvirlim ] ) , one obtains the _ absolute minimum _ of the complex free energy in the whole @xmath100 and @xmath88 space . at that point in the parameter space",
    "the free energy is exactly _ zero _ which is the absolute minimum .",
    "this is due to the fact that the core charge exactly neutralizes the protein charge yielding effectively the uncharged shell ( @xmath101 ) of radius @xmath102 .",
    "note , however , that the assembly free energy is not bounded from below .",
    "we now insert eq .",
    "( [ eq : fvirlim ] ) in eq .",

    "fig : figexnotails ] .",
    "these were obtained by solving full pb equation , without linearizing it .",
    "we see that the phase diagram in this case is totally ",
    "flat  - the smallest possible @xmath1-number structure will always be the one with smallest complex energy , irrespectively of the core charge and its radius ( at least in the range of values considered here , and the conditions summarized in [ subs : thermod ] ) .",
    "thus , the phase diagram is governed solely by simple geometry .",
    "the same result comes out also in the dh approximation .",
    "note also how the assembly free energy shows practically no dependence on @xmath15 and @xmath14 when @xmath104 .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this regime , the assembly free energy is simply the ( positive ) electrostatic self - energy of the capsid which depends only on @xmath63 , i.e. the @xmath1 number of the capsid ( see also eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltfdh ] ) for the debye - hckel description of this situation ) . when @xmath105 ( i.e. about 1 nm in our case , @xmath106 mm ) , the electrostatic attraction between the core and the capsid becomes only partially screened by salt ions , and the free energy of the assembly , @xmath86 , becomes negative suggesting that the assembly is thermodynamically preferrable , releasing extra energy in the solution .",
    "the assembly is also more efficient for larger core charge densities .    we still need to consider what happens in the case when the protein charges are delocalized on the flexible polyelectrolyte tails . in particular , the decrease of the volume of the space between the core and the capsid when @xmath107 would importantly confine the polyelectrolyte tails .",
    "we can thus expect their entropic and self - interaction contributions to become of the largest importance in the region where the assembly free energy of the tailless monomers shows the most negative values .",
    "we now assume that the protein charge is distributed along the flexible n - tails , i.e. we take all the details of the model developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] into account .",
    "first , we calculate the free energies of the complex without the account of the finite extensibility of the tails , i.e. we solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pbe ] ) and ( [ eq : polyel ] ) with boundary conditions for the polyelectrolyte amplitude as specified in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : impen1 ] ) and ( [ eq : anchor ] ) . from the",
    "thus obtained free energy , we subtract the electrostatic self - energy of the core .",
    "the ensuing assembly free energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freentail ] .",
    "we see that although the assembly free energies are of the same order of magnitude as in the case of tailless capsomeres , the shape of the free energy landscape is quite different and the assembly is now governed both by the core charge and by its radius .",
    "this is most easily seen by the complicated shape of the regions denoted by @xmath8 , @xmath108 , and @xmath5 in the @xmath109 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : freentail ] , which correspond to capsids with the lowest free energy .",
    "we also see that when the two radii are close to each other , the free energy steeply rises .",
    "this is easy to understand , since in this case , the tails are forced to redistribute in a small volume in between the capsid and the core , so the contribution of entropic confinement to the free energy becomes significant .",
    "interestingly , in the case of an infinitely thin capsid studied in the previous section , it was in these regions that the assembly free energy sharply _ dropped _",
    ", exactly the opposite from the case we have here .",
    "it is thus clear at this point that the tails do introduce different physics into the problem .",
    "the assembly free energy in general also decreases with @xmath15 which is an effect that we saw in the previous subsection and is due solely to electrostatics .",
    "we also observe that the values of the free energy are mostly smaller from the ones obtained in the model of an infinitely thin charged capsid , which essentially means that the tails can adopt such conformations that reduce the electrostatic part of the free energy to a significant extent , especially in the electrostatically unfavorable regime .",
    "note also how the structure with the lowest assembly free energy increases its radius ( and total charge ) as the core charge increases ( e.g. for @xmath110=8.25 nm one can see the progression from @xmath8 , @xmath9 to @xmath5 structures as @xmath15 increases ) .",
    "this can be simply explained by the screening of the core by the capsomer tails - the more charged the core , the more capsomeres ( i.e. larger @xmath1 numbers ) are needed to screen it efficiently . but",
    "note here that the tails are assumed to be maximally flexible and can thus easily stretch from practically arbitrary distances ( capsid ) to the core in order to screen it . for given core radius , @xmath14 ,",
    "the assembly free energy is positive when @xmath111 , and it decreases as @xmath15 increases , becoming negative for some  critical  core charge density , whose typical values in the range of parameters considered are @xmath112 e / nm@xmath94 .",
    "thus , in order for the assembly to proceed spontaneously , the cores need to be sufficiently charged .    to see whether the results are influenced by the maximal extensibility of the tails , in fig .",
    "[ fig : freentailansatz ] we plot the assembly free energy using the maximal extensibility ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxstretch ] ) together with boundary conditions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ubound ] ) .",
    "again , the assembly free energies are of the same order of magnitude , but the borders between the different regions in the @xmath109 plane are quite different with respect to those obtained without the maximal extensibility ansatz . in order to better understand the results obtained thus far , it helps to plot the spatial distribution of the protein monomers , i.e. @xmath113 , within the space between the core and the inner capsid radius . a solution for the case when @xmath114 ( 1620 monomers in total ) , @xmath115 nm ( @xmath1=3 ) , @xmath116 nm , @xmath117 @xmath93/nm@xmath94 is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : conc1 ] .",
    "what this figure nicely illustrates is that the tails stretch out from the capsid surface towards the core so that they accumulate around the oppositely charged core .",
    "there are still some monomers in the space between the core and the capsid , but the dominant density is situated in a shell around the core .",
    "one can also see how the constrained solution stays above the maximal extensibility limit in eq.([eq : maxstretch ] ) .",
    "one should keep in mind that the boundary conditions for the two solutions are different , so one can not expect that the constrained variation will always yield larger energy .",
    "this is also the case for the displayed calculation where we find @xmath118 @xmath119 , and @xmath120 @xmath119 for the unconstrained and constrained values of the complex free energy , respectively .",
    "note how the constrained polyelectrolyte density in fact approaches closer to the charged core than the unconstrained density due to the different boundary conditions that the two satisfy .",
    "the noted effect results in the lowering of the free energy in the constrained case . however , this is not always the case , and it depends on the distance between the core and the capsid ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "when this distance is sufficiently large , the tails can not accumulate around the core even when they maximally stretch , so that they can not screen the core efficiently .",
    "this effect is not present in the calculation with the unconstrained polyelectrolyte amplitude .",
    "this is in fact the most important reason for the different look of boundaries in the @xmath109 plane for the two calculations .",
    "note how in the unconstrained case , the complex of core with @xmath5 capsid has the lowest energy for sufficiently large @xmath15 ( @xmath122 e / nm@xmath94 ) in a huge range of radii @xmath14 ( 8 - 16 nm , see fig .",
    "[ fig : freentail ] ) .",
    "however , the maximal length of the ( fully stretched ) tails is @xmath123 nm , so that for @xmath124 nm tails are very much extended and only a small part of the polyelectrolyte density can gather around the core . as the unconstrained results do not account for this effect , by breaking the maximal extensibility limit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxstretch ] ) the polyelectrolyte density screens the core efficiently and thus lowers the free energy of the @xmath5 structure with respect to the value obtained in the constrained calculation .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] for @xmath5 ( @xmath125 nm , @xmath95 ) , @xmath124 nm , @xmath126 e / nm@xmath94 . note how the maximal extensibility limit is severely broken in the unconstrained calculation .",
    "the free energies of the complexes are @xmath127 @xmath119 , and @xmath128 @xmath119 in the unconstrained and constrained calculations , respectively , demonstrating the effect discussed .",
    "it is of interest to examine the efficiency of core screening by the polyelectrolyte tails somewhat closer .",
    "we define the ratio @xmath129 which can be interpreted as a percentage of monomers in a shell of thickness @xmath23 ( monomer - monomer separation ) around the core .",
    "this can also be thought of as the percentage of monomers that cover ( are  in contact with  ) the core . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cover ] we display the coverage @xmath130 as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath14 for @xmath5 capsid ( @xmath125 nm ) .",
    "what can be easily seen from this plot is the gradual shift of the polyelectrolyte density from the space close to capsid to the shell surrounding the core as the core charge density ( @xmath15 ) increases . due to the maximal extensibility constraint",
    "that was included in these calculations , @xmath130 parameter saturates at a value smaller than 1 as @xmath15 increases .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that the polyelectrolyte must pass through the region between the core and the capsid in order to accumulate around the core , and so much of its density may remain in the space in between the capsid and the core .",
    "this effect becomes more important when @xmath131 becomes comparable to the tail length , @xmath132 .",
    "the charge density of the core at which one observes the significant accumulation of the monomers around the core ( @xmath133 e / nm@xmath94 ) is the same as the charge density at which the assembly free energy becomes negative , i.e. the assembly proceeds spontaneously .",
    "an intriguing feature of our results is that both the core charge and its radius determine the size of the capsid around the core .",
    "a particularly interesting case is when the core radius is close ( but somewhat smaller ) to the t=1 capsid , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath134 nm . for sufficiently small core surface charge density ( @xmath135 e / nm@xmath94 ) , @xmath8 structures around the cores shall form . however ,",
    "if the surface charge density increases over some critical value ( around 1.0 e / nm@xmath94 in the constrained model of the polyelectrolyte ) , @xmath1=``2 '' capsids shall form , in spite of the fact that the core radius is more than 5 nm smaller from the radius of @xmath1=``2 '' capsid ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : freentailansatz ] ) .",
    "this clearly shows that in addition to core radius , which dominantly influences the assembly process , one needs to have an adequate charge density in order to produce the structures of desired t - number .",
    "the same effect is present on the @xmath1=``2 '' and @xmath5 border when @xmath136 nm .",
    "we show this transition region in another way in fig .",
    "[ fig : transit ] .    note that although the free energy curves indeed cross for certain values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 , their magnitudes remain quite similar even deeply in the transition region .",
    "thus one could expect to observe a polydisperse distribution of @xmath1=``2 '' and @xmath5 structures in a solution with a monodisperse distribution of core size and charge density .",
    "an interesting effect is observed for @xmath137 nm in fig .",
    "[ fig : transit ] where there exists _ two _ intersections between the free energy curves for @xmath1=``2 '' and @xmath1=3 complexes as @xmath15 increases .",
    "if the charge density is lower than 0.3 , @xmath1=3 structures have the lowest assembly free energy .",
    "quite surprisingly , upon increasing the charge density , @xmath9 structures become the dominant ones , i.e. the size of thermodynamicaly preferred capsids decreases .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that with increasing the charge density , the monomers in the n - terminal tails prefer to sit next to the core , i.e .",
    ", the electrostatic interaction wins over the chain configurational entropy .",
    "however , as we increase the core charge density beyond 0.7 , it becomes more advantageous to have @xmath138 structures again as there will be more charges associated with the n - tails of @xmath1=3 structures .",
    "an even more interesting effect is illustrated in fig . 9 for @xmath139 cores .",
    "here , we observe three transition lines instead of two of the previous case .",
    "somewhat counter - intuitively , for the charge densities above 1.3 , @xmath1=``2 '' particles become free energy minima structures again .",
    "this indicates that under physiological conditions , if we increase the charges on the cores significantly , the lowest possible @xmath1 structures ( @xmath9 in this case ) form so that more charges on the n - tails can sit in the immediate vicinity of the core .",
    "this is due to the maximal extensibility constraint , and the effect is not present in the calculation with the tails that do not satisfy the constraint ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : freentail ] ) . for sufficiently charged cores ( @xmath140 e / nm@xmath94 )",
    ", it turns out to be better again to have smaller number of total charges ( i.e. the @xmath9 instead of @xmath5 capsid ) that can approach the capsid easily without any geometrical constraint .",
    "it is obvious from the previous discussion that the finite extensibility of the tails is important for determination of the lowest energy structures .",
    "one can see this most easily by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : freentail ] and [ fig : freentailansatz ] .",
    "this effect becomes particularly important for structures in which the core is significantly smaller than the capsid , i.e. when @xmath141 .    to test the theory of our previous paragraph",
    ", we repeated our calculations at lower salt concentrations .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : figphase ] as it is shown in the figure the transition line from @xmath1=3 to @xmath1=``2 '' is moved to very high @xmath142 as expected .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that the thermodynamics of the assembly nontrivially depends on the electrostatic and geometric constraints which include @xmath143 ( electrostatic screening ) , maximal possible stretching @xmath144 , and confinement @xmath145 of the protein tails .",
    "our study provides quantitative guidelines for experiments aiming to assemble  hybrid  structures , i.e. protein shells around charged and impenetrable cores , especially in the limit when the number of cores is much smaller than the number of proteins .",
