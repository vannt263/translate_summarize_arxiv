    "direct photons emerging from relativistic heavy ion collisions have long been considered an important probe of the entire evolution of the colliding system  @xcite . at almost all known or conjectured stages of the collision there are processes producing photon . unlike hadronic observables that mostly encode the state of the medium at kinetic freeze - out , photons are emitted at all times throughout the rapid evolution of the heavy ion collision and leave the interaction region unmodified .",
    "thus by measuring direct photons one has access to information about the properties and dynamics of the medium integrated over space and time .",
    "the measurement of direct photons is challenging due to a large background of photons from the vacuum decay of final state hadrons ( , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , etc . ) .",
    "the phenix experiment at rhic reported large direct and thermal photon yields  @xcite with strong centrality dependence  @xcite and significant azimuthal anisotropy or `` elliptic flow ''  @xcite .",
    "particularly surprising is the discovery of the large azimuthal anisotropy of direct photons at rhic  @xcite , which is comparable to that observed for hadrons  @xcite .",
    "preliminary results from the lhc  @xcite show the same effect .",
    "the observation of large azimuthal anisotropy combined with observations published earlier that the direct photon yields themselves are large  @xcite contradicts several existing interpretations where the large yields are provided at the very early production stage , when the temperature of the system is highest but the collective flow including azimuthal asymmetry is negligible .",
    "conversely , the observed large anisotropy suggests that photon production occurs at very late stages of the collision when the collective flow of the system is fully developed , while the temperature and the corresponding thermal photon emission rates are already lower .",
    "indeed , theoretical models have great difficulty to simultaneously describe the observed yields and anisotropy .",
    "this failure , colloquially called `` the direct photon puzzle '' , triggered a large amount of theoretical work , new models and insights @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present new , more precise results on the azimuthal anisotropy of direct photon emission from 200gev collisions recorded in 2007 and 2010 by the phenix experiment .",
    "results include second and third order fourier components of azimuthal distributions ( and , respectively ) measured over a transverse momentum range extended down to 0.4 . the new data , together with published results on yields , are compared to some of the more recent model calculations .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : expgeneral ] we describe the experiment , the data set , the way events are selected and categorized , and the two methods by which photons are measured . in sec .",
    "[ sec : expv2 ] the steps needed to determine the direct photon , , and their uncertainties are described , and the final results are presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec : modelcomp ] the results are compared to a few models treating yields and azimuthal asymmetries in a consistent framework . sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] summarizes our findings .",
    "in phenix photons are detected by two substantially different techniques .",
    "the first technique uses external conversion of photons as described in detail in ref .",
    "this method provides a high purity photon sample with good momentum resolution , but requires large statistics due to the few percent conversion probability and reduced acceptance .",
    "therefore the range is limited .",
    "the second technique is a traditional calorimetric measurement of photons similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , but with higher statistics . for photons identified by either technique ,",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy is extracted with the event plane ( ep ) method . here",
    "we give a brief summary of the phenix detector systems and a short description of the two analyses .",
    "data from 200gev collisions were recorded with a minimum bias ( mb ) trigger based on the signal in the beam - beam counters ( bbc  @xcite ) , which are located around the beampipe at @xmath8 and cover the full azimuth .",
    "the minimum bias trigger requires at least one hit in each of the two bbcs ( north and south ) as well as a reconstructed vertex from the time - of - flight difference between the two sides .",
    "the efficiency of the mb trigger is @xmath9% .",
    "collision centrality is calculated as percentiles of the total charge distribution in the north and south bbc .",
    "the centrality determination is based on percentiles of the total charge seen in the north and south bbc and takes into account small shifts in @xmath6 coverage due to variations of the collision @xmath10-vertex .",
    "external conversion photons are reconstructed from @xmath11 minimum bias = 200gev events recorded during the 2010 data taking period .",
    "the event vertex in this dataset was @xmath12 cm to ensure that the magnetic field is sufficiently uniform .",
    "the same sample was previously used in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine direct photon yield and its centrality dependence , where details of this analysis can be found . in the rest of this paper this sample",
    "is referred to as `` conversion photons '' .",
    "photons convert to @xmath13 pairs in the readout plane of the hadron blind detector ( hbd  @xcite ) , which is located at @xmath1460 cm radial distance from the collision vertex and corresponds to @xmath143% @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the radiation length .",
    "the electron and positron from the photon conversion are tracked through the phenix central tracking detectors @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal direction @xmath17 and the momentum @xmath18 are reconstructed from the drift chamber ( dc ) information , while the polar angle of each track is determined by a point measurement in the innermost pad - chamber ( pc1 ) and the collision vertex .",
    "high efficiency electron identification cuts are used to reduce the hadron contamination in the sample .",
    "light above a minimum threshold in the ring imaging erenkov detector ( rich  @xcite ) and a matching cluster of energy @xmath19 in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal  @xcite ) such that @xmath20gev and @xmath21 , where @xmath18 is the momentum , are required .",
    "the emcal comprises two calorimeter types : 6 sectors of lead scintillator sampling calorimeter ( pbsc ) and 2 sectors of lead glass erenkov calorimeter ( pbgl ) .",
    "the typical energy resolution of the pbsc is @xmath22 , and that of the pbgl is @xmath23 .",
    "all remaining tracks with @xmath24 , are combined to pairs .",
    "conversion photons are identified by analyzing the invariant mass of the pairs .",
    "the default tracking in phenix assumes that each track originates at the collision vertex .",
    "thus , if the @xmath13 pair comes from a conversion of a real photon in the hbd readout plane , the momenta will be mis - measured and a finite mass , in this case about @xmath2512mev/@xmath26 , is reconstructed .",
    "conversely , if the momenta are re - calculated assuming the hbd readout plane as origin , the invariant mass is close to zero . through a simultaneous cut on both mass calculations a sample of photon conversions with a purity of 99%",
    "is obtained down to = 0.4  @xcite .",
    "the remaining 1% of pairs are mostly from the dalitz decays .",
    "the phenix emcal is the principal detector in the calorimetric analysis , which is performed in a similar way as in ref .",
    "the and are measured simultaneously for inclusive photons and s. a total of @xmath27 mb events from the 2007 data taking period are analyzed .",
    "the event vertex in this sample was @xmath28 cm .",
    "photon candidates in the emcal are clusters above a threshold energy of 0.2gev that pass a shower shape cut as well as a charged particle veto cut by the pad chamber pc3 immediately in front of the emcal .",
    "the is measured via the 2@xmath29 decay channel , with a cut on the energy asymmetry of the two photons @xmath30 0.8 . for each bin",
    "the number of reconstructed sis taken as the integral of the two - photon invariant mass distribution , with the combinatorial background subtracted by the mixed event method  @xcite . the signal to background ratio at @xmath31is 0.1 , rapidly improving with increasing .    for the inclusive photon measurement",
    "it is important to restrict the measurement to a region where the residual contamination from misidentified hadrons is small .",
    "therefore , in the inclusive photon sample only clusters with @xmath32gev are considered .",
    "the systematic uncertainty from particle identification ( pid ) of photons is estimated by varying both the shower shape cut ( five different settings ) and , independently , applying or omitting the charged particle veto cut .",
    "all variations are then fully corrected , and the rms deviation of those fully corrected results is quoted as systematic uncertainty due to pid .",
    "phenix has different detector systems to establish the event plane ( ep ) .",
    "they cover various pseudorapidity ranges : the outer and inner reaction plane detector ( rxno , 1@xmath331.5 , rxni , 1.5@xmath332.8 ) , the muon piston calorimeters ( mpcs , -3.7@xmath34 - 3.1 , mpcn , 3.1@xmath343.9 ) , and the beam - beam counters ( bbc , 3.1@xmath333.9 ) .",
    "all these detectors cover the full @xmath35 azimuth and are sufficiently separated in pseudorapidity such that we do not expect auto correlations between the event plane determination and the photon production asymmetry measured .",
    "the rxn , inner and outer , are scintillation counter systems with a 2 cm pb converter that makes them sensitive to photons in addition to charged particles .",
    "the results in this paper are obtained using the event planes measured by the combination of the inner and outer rxn  @xcite . due to the large rapidity coverage",
    "this combination has the best resolution .",
    "the resolution @xmath36 is measured with the 2-subevent method  @xcite .",
    "the resolution for rxn and mpc is shown in figure  [ fig : eventplanereso ] .",
    "the final results are cross - checked by using the other detectors for the event plane determination . despite the significant difference in resolution",
    "the measured direct photon anisotropies are consistent , within the systematic uncertainties .",

    "we refer to these coefficients as inclusive photon @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the second step ( ii ) , the decay photon @xmath48 and @xmath49 are estimated , i.e. the anisotropy resulting from the decays of hadrons to photons .",

    "the quoted @xmath57 values come from the average cosine method , while in the calorimeter analysis the quoted @xmath57 values are the average of the results obtained with the two methods , and the systematic uncertainty is the deviation between the two .",

    "both measurements agree in the region where they overlap .",
    "about 80%90% of the inclusive photons come from decays of neutral mesons and exhibit an anisotropy with respect to the event plane that results from the anisotropy of the parent mesons  @xcite . to estimate this contribution we use measured yields and anisotropy for charged and neutral pions ; @xmath57 for heavier mesons is obtained by @xmath58 scaling as described below .",

    "the third curve , labelled `` semi - qgp , w / o viscous '' , shows the consequence of including the effect of confinement on the photon emission rate , as computed in the semi - qgp approach  @xcite .",
    "the utilization of the semi - qgp photon rates at high temperatures suppresses the spectrum , but does not change the @xmath57 significantly .",
    "this is a consequence of the small contribution of qgp photons to the thermal photon , which is dominantly produced at temperatures around and smaller than the confinement temperature .",

    "none of them describe the full systematics of the data adequately , but there has been progress in the last few years .",
    "the general trend of the models appears to be including sources from the earliest ( pre - equilibrium , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) or very late times in the evolution of the system , while giving less emphasis to photon production at intermediate times , when most of the expansion occurs .",
    "phsd includes new sources from the hadron gas and photon production even after the hadrons are decoupled from each other , which improves description of the yields but still under predicts .",
    "the model that best approximates the measured , including the region where reaches its maximum value , starts the evolution with a large initial boost even before thermalization  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that the microscopic transport model  @xcite is able to describe the anisotropies as well as the full - scale viscous hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "while the data are getting more differential and more accurate , and model calculations improve , the `` direct photon puzzle '' remains unresolved .",
    "high quality data of yields and and for different collision systems , including very asymmetric ones , and energies would help to further improve our understanding of direct photon production because robust models must be able to describe the data over a wide range of experimental conditions .",
