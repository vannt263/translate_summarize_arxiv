    "in recent years , the r - mode oscillations in rotating stars have been found to be significant implications .",
    "the axial oscillations are unstable by the gravitational radiation reaction ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism of the instability can be understood by the generic argument for the gravitational radiation driven instability , so - called cfs - instability , which is originally examined for the polar perturbations , ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "all rotating stars become unstable in the absence of internal fluid dissipation , irrespective of the parity modes .",
    "viscosity however damps out the oscillations , and stabilizes them in general .",
    "the polar f - mode instability is believed to act only in rapidly rotating neutron stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the axial instability is however found to set in even in much more slowly rotating cases , and to play an important role on the evolution of hot newly - born neutron stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the instability carries away most of angular momentum and rotational energy of the stars by the gravitational radiation . the gravitational wave emitted during the spin - down process is expected to be one of the promising sources for the laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of the estimates for the r - mode instability are based on the newtonian calculations .",
    "that is , the oscillation frequencies are determined by inviscid hydrodynamics under the newtonian gravity , and the gravitational radiation reaction is incorporated by evaluating the ( current ) multipole moments .",
    "relativity has great influence on stellar structures , redshift in oscillation frequencies , frame dragging , radiations and so on .",
    "it is important to explore the relativistic effects , which may not change the general features of the oscillations , but shift the critical angular velocity .",
    "the relativistic calculation is not so easy task , even using the linear perturbation method concerning the oscillation amplitude .",
    "both relativity and rotation complicate the problems considerably .",
    "as the first step toward a clear understanding of relativistic corrections , we have examined the r - mode oscillations with two approximations , the slow rotation approximation ( @xcite ) and the cowling approximation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rotation is assumed to be slow , and treated as small perturbation from the non - rotating case .",
    "we also assume that the perturbation of the gravity can be neglected in the oscillations .",
    "the accuracy of the cowling approximation are tested in the rotating relativistic system ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the calculations give the same qualitative results and reasonable accuracy of the oscillation frequencies , as in the newtonian stellar pulsation theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in section 2 ,",
    "we summarize the basic equations for the inviscid fluid in slowly rotating relativistic stars and the perturbation scheme to solve them .",
    "the r - mode solution is given at the lowest order with respect to the rotational parameter in section 3 .",
    "the mode can not be specified by a single frequency unlike in the newtonian r - mode oscillation , although the frequency is bounded to a certain range .",
    "the spatial function of the mode is arbitrary at this order . in order to determine the radial structure , we need the rotational corrections up to the third order in the background . in section 4",
    ", we include the rotational effects , and derive the equation governing the r - mode oscillations in non - barotropic region .",
    "the resultant equation becomes singular in the barotropic case , since the second - order differential term vanishes . in section 5 ,",
    "we separately consider for the barotropic stars the mode function and the correction to the leading order . in section 6",

    "the exceptional case is the incompressible fluid , in which @xmath194 is a constant since @xmath195 the correction in the frequency for @xmath196 is @xmath197 which should be the same value calculated by @xcite except a misprint in their expression ."
