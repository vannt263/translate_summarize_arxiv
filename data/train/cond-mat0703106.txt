    "the static and dynamical properties of macromolecules in solution are important for a variety of systems , commonly referred to as soft - matter , such as polymers , colloids , self - assembled structures , etc .",
    "such systems are heavily affected by the dynamical behaviour of their microscopic components@xcite , but not necessarily by their chemical details .",
    "this allows for a coarse - grained description of solute molecules which ignores molecular specificity@xcite .",
    "indeed , the coarse grained modelling of macromolecules in solution can be a challenge , as time and space scales involved in such processes can easily span a range between tens of femtoseconds and microseconds , i.e. eight orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , coarse - grained dilute systems can be computational overwhelming with the greater part of the computational effort spent resolving the solvent rather than the solute , as the ratio of the number of solvent particles to the number of solute particles can be very large .",
    "nonetheless solvent molecules , in which macromolecules are embedded , must be accounted for since long range correlations produced by hydrodynamic interactions contribute significantly to the dynamical behaviour of macromolecules . in these cases , it is not possible to approximate the solvent by a thermal bath ( langevin dynamics ) that disregards momentum transport .",
    "recently , various methods have been developed in order to avoid the explicit inclusion of solvent particles while still retaining the hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "this is achieved by coupling a fluctuating hydrodynamics ( fh ) solver to the macromolecular dynamics , which is solved using standard molecular dynamics ( md ) techniques .",
    "we refer to these approaches as hybrid methods since the resulting dynamics of the system is taken care of by two different solvers .",
    "ladd@xcite was the first to include hydrodynamic effects in solid - fluid suspensions while developing a method to couple colloidal particles with a fluctuating lattice boltzmann solver .",
    "sharma and patanakar@xcite later extended ladd s approach by including fluctuating navier - stokes equations in the study of brownian motion .",
    "these authors report good agreement between simulation results and analytical and experimental data@xcite .",
    "a second method was introduced by ahlrichs and dnweg@xcite to study polymer dynamics .",
    "they coupled the polymer chain dynamics to a fluctuating lattice boltzmann solver@xcite using a dissipative term @xcite .",
    "they were able to correctly capture the effects of hydrodynamic interactions on the chain dynamics , while usta et al.@xcite , using the same method , also studied the diffusion of polymer chains in a channel .",
    "a third method uses stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd ) , also known as multiparticle - collision dynamics ( mpcd ) as the fh solver .",
    "the chain dynamics is coupled to the solvent by including the monomers in the chain in the collision step@xcite .",
    "this method has been used to study many different systems , including polymer @xcite and colloid@xcite dynamics , block copolymers@xcite and shear thinning@xcite .",
    "both methods report a considerable computational speed up when compared to particle - based , explicit solvent md simulations but still retain the effect of hydrodynamics interactions .    in this work",
    ", we present an implicit solvent method based on the approach of ahlrichs and dnweg@xcite but using a recently developed solver@xcite for the fluctuating hydrodynamics ( fh ) equations .",
    "this solver provides an accurate description of the solvent from both hydrodynamic and thermodynamic points of view@xcite .",
    "in addition , the fluid properties such as the equation of state and transport parameters such as shear and bulk coefficients provide direct numerical input in this model , allowing us to inspect the dependence of macromolecular dynamics on fluid parameters .",
    "in the following , we give an exhaustive description of the model .",
    "in particular , we illustrate the fh equations ; we describe in detail the coarse - graining procedure used to model fully flexible polymers and how simulation parameters are directly calculated from fully atomistic simulation force fields . in section [ results ]",
    "we report the static and dynamical properties of fully flexible polymers , then we illustrate the effects of different solvent parameters on the chain dynamics .",
    "finally we investigate the role of fluctuations , providing an estimated length - scale beyond which they can be ignored when studying macromolecular diffusion .",

[ discretecorr ] ) . for volumes close to the molecular scale one would expect that fluctuations are not delta - correlated in a molecular system , limiting the minimum size over which a discrete fluctuating hydrodynamics description is valid . in practical terms , a box of size @xmath31 has already proved to give good agreement between molecular dynamics and continuum descriptions @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the fluctuations is also important in determining the integration step for the stochastic differential equations .",

    "due to the hybrid nature of our model , it is convenient to use the same units for md and fh .",

    ", we note that independently of the coarse graining scheme , numerical diffusion does not affect this type of microscopic simulation , as reynolds numbers are very low ( approximately zero ) and the fluid viscosity is dominant compared to the numerical one@xcite .",
    "we have presented in this paper a general hybrid model to simulate the dynamics of macromolecules in solution .",
    "the term hybrid refers to the fact that hydrodynamic forces are calculated by a separate fluctuating hydrodynamics solver coupled with the macromolecular dynamics . treating the solvent implicitly allows for a significant saving in computational time .",
    "we estimate a speed - up factor of 30 for the simulations performed here compared to particle - based simulations .",
    "we use a newly developed hydrodynamic solver that integrates the fluctuating hydrodynamics equations .",
    "fluctuations are included according to the landau formalism and are thermodynamically consistent .",
    "in addition , fluid characteristics such as transport parameters and equations of state are direct input parameters .",
    "we have studied fully flexible polymers in tip3p water at @xmath175 with our model .",
    "we show that static and dynamical properties for the polymer chain are correctly captured .",
    "in particular , the critical exponent @xmath176 is calculated using @xmath177 in the lj potential while the zimm model prediction for the scaling of monomeric diffusion is also obtained .",
    "this confirms that hydrodynamic interactions are quantitatively described in this simulations framework . in order to provide information on the much debated issue of the scaling behaviour of the autocorrelation functions of the rouse modes @xmath134",
    ", we calculate these and demonstrate that the p - dependent scaling formula suggested by ahlrichs and dnweg describes the simulation results well .",
    "moreover , our model relaxes the hypothesis of a non - fluctuating , incompressible hydrodynamic tensor assumed by the zimm model .",
    "moreover , as found by other authors with different methods@xcite , our results show the robustness and consistency of these hypothesis for the case of a polymer chain in a viscous and nearly incompressible fluid such as water .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of various solvent parameters on chain dynamics .",
    "we found the predicted direct proportionality between the diffusion coefficient of a polymer chain and the temperature of the solvent .",
    "as a consequence of working in a nearly incompressible regime and with the present coupling scheme , altering the equation of state and bulk viscosity have a negligible influence on chain diffusion .",
    "we tested the predicted zimm formula for the dependence of chain diffusion with viscosity for a range of viscosities .",
    "our data show a good agreement with zimm theory when the viscosity @xmath17 is greater than @xmath178 .",
    "we therefore estimate that the high schmidt number hypothesis starts to fail at @xmath179 , i.e. around a third of the viscosity of water",
    ". it would be interesting to test this prediction experimentally .",
    "we point out that our results for solvent effects should hold for a generic macromolecule diluted in solvent .",
    "we investigated the importance of fluctuations on the dynamics of a chain , confirming as expected that the importance of the fluctuating term in the navier - stokes equations decreases as system size increases .",
    "we suggest that a lattice size @xmath180 is a safe estimate to restrict the error introduced by the preaveraged approximation to a few percent . finally , we discussed the importance of the coarse - graining method that needs to be employed in order to achieve agreement between simulation results and experimental observations .",
    "we obtain a realistic diffusion coefficient for dna chains using a tailored coarse - graining procedure which can be used in future work concerned with the study of real systems .",
    "we also plan to use this model to investigate the dynamics of less theoretically well understood systems such as dendrimers , semi - flexible polymers and very dilute many - chains systems .",
