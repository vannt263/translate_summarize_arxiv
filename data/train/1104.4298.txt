    "[ figcurvedgabor3d],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    all aforementioned applications have in common that they use _ straight _ gabor filters , i.e. the x- and y - axis of the window underlying the gf are straight lines which are orthogonal . having the natural curvature inherent to fingerprints in mind , we propose _ curved gabor filters _",
    "( see figure [ figcurvedgabor3d ] ) for image enhancement @xcite .",
    "a gf can be regarded as an anisotropic diffusion filter which smooths along the orientation and performs inverse diffusion orthogonal to the orientation @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to adopt the gf to the curved structure and smooth along the bent ridges and valleys .",
    "while this paper focuses on fingerprint image enhancement , curved gabor filters might also be useful in other fields of application , e.g. for the enhancement of curved structures like muscle fibers , cell filaments or annual rings in tree discs .",
    "image quality @xcite has a big impact on the performance of a fingerprint recognition system ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . the goal of image enhancement is to improve the overall performance by optimally preparing input images for later processing stages .",
    "most systems extract minutiae from fingerprints @xcite , and the presence of noise can interfere with the extraction . as a result , true minutiae may be missed and false minutiae may be detected , both having a negative effect on the recognition rate . in order to avoid these two types of errors , image enhancement aims at improving the clarity of the ridge and valley structure . with special consideration to the typical types of noise occurring in fingerprints ,",
    "an image enhancement method should have three important properties :    * reconnect broken ridges , e.g. caused by dryness of the finger or scars ; * separate falsely conglutinated ridges , e.g. caused by wetness of the finger or smudges ; * preserve ridge endings and bifurcations .",
    "enhancement of low quality images ( occurring e.g. in all databases of fvc2004 @xcite ) and very low quality prints like latents ( e.g. nist sd27 @xcite ) is still a challenge .",
    "techniques based on contextual filtering are widely used for fingerprint image enhancement @xcite and a major difficulty lies in an automatic and reliable estimation of the local context , i.e. the local orientation and ridge frequency as input of the gf .",
    "failure to correctly estimate the local context can lead to the creation of artifacts in the enhanced image @xcite which consequently tends to increase the number of identification or verification errors .    for low quality images",
    ", there is a substantial risk that an image enhancement step may impair the recognition performance as shown in @xcite ( results are cited in table [ tabbz3 ] of section [ secresults ] ) .",
    "the situation is even worse for very low quality images , and current approaches focus on minimizing the efforts required by a human expert for manually marking information in images of latent prints ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the present work addresses these challenges as follows : in the next section , two state - of - the - art methods for orientation field estimation are combined for obtaining an estimation which is more robust than each individual one . in section [ secrf ] ,",

    "the paper concludes with a discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of this approach , as well as possible future directions in section [ secconclusions ] .",
    "in order to obtain a robust orientation field ( of ) estimation for low quality images , two estimation methods are combined : the line sensor method @xcite and the gradients based method @xcite ( with a smoothing window size of 33 pixels ) .",
    "the ofs are compared at each pixel .",
    "if the angle between both estimations is smaller than a threshold ( here @xmath1  ) , the orientation of the combined of is set to the average of the two .",
    "otherwise , the pixel is marked as missing .",
    "afterwards , all inner gaps are reconstructed and up to a radius of 16 pixels , the orientation of the outer proximity is extrapolated , both as described in @xcite .",
    "results of verification tests on all 12 databases of fvc2000 to 2004 @xcite showed a better performance of the combined of applied for contextual image enhancement than each individual of estimation @xcite .",
    "the of being the only parameter that was changed , lower equal error rates can be interpreted as an indicator that the combined of contains fewer estimation errors than each of the individual estimations .",
    "simultaneously , we regard the combined of as a segmentation of the fingerprint image into foreground ( endowed with an of estimation ) and background .",
    "the information fusion strategy for obtaining the combined of was inspired by @xcite .",

    "failures to estimate a rf , e.g. caused due to presence of noise , curvature or minutiae , are handled by interpolation and outliers are removed by low - pass filtering . in our experience , this method works well for good and medium quality prints , but it encounters serious difficulties obtaining a useful estimation when dealing with low quality prints .    in this section , we propose a rf estimation method following the same basic idea - to obtain an estimation from the gray - level profile - but which bears several improvements in comparison to @xcite : ( i )  the profile is derived from a curved region which is different in shape and size from the oriented window of the x - signature method , ( ii ) we introduce an information criterion ( ic ) for the reliability of an estimation and ( iii ) depending on the ic , the gray - level profile is smoothed with a gaussian kernel , ( iv ) both , minima and maxima are taken into account and ( v ) the inverse median is applied for the rf estimate .",
    "if the clarity of the ridge and valley structure is disturbed by noise , e.g. caused by dryness or wetness of the finger , an oriented window of @xmath4 pixels may not contain a sufficient amount of information for a rf estimation ( e.g. see figure [ figcomparisonrf ] , left image ) . in regions where the ridges run almost parallel ,",
    "this may be compensated by averaging over larger distances along the lines . however ,",
    "if the ridges are curved , the enlargement of the rectangular window does not improve the consistency of the gray - profile , because the straight lines cut neighboring ridges and valleys . in order to overcome this limitation , we propose _ curved regions _ which adapt their shape to the local orientation .",
    "it is important to take the curvature of ridges and valleys into account , because about 94 % of all fingerprints belong to the classes right loop , whorl , left loop and tented arch @xcite , so that they contain core points and therefore regions of high curvature .",

    "<S> gabor filters play an important role in many application areas for the enhancement of various types of images and the extraction of gabor features . for the purpose of enhancing curved structures in noisy images , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce curved gabor filters which locally adapt their shape to the direction of flow . </S>",
    "<S> these curved gabor filters enable the choice of filter parameters which increase the smoothing power without creating artifacts in the enhanced image . in this paper , curved gabor filters </S>",
    "<S> are applied to the curved ridge and valley structure of low - quality fingerprint images . </S>",
    "<S> first , we combine two orientation field estimation methods in order to obtain a more robust estimation for very noisy images . </S>",
    "<S> next , curved regions are constructed by following the respective local orientation and they are used for estimating the local ridge frequency . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , curved gabor filters are defined based on curved regions and they are applied for the enhancement of low - quality fingerprint images . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results on the fvc2004 databases show improvements of this approach in comparison to state - of - the - art enhancement methods . </S>"
