    "the @xmath4 expansion of @xmath5 gauge theories is a particularly useful tool for exploring the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd and related theories .",
    "applications can be found in many areas of research , including the dynamics of confinement , issues related to the phase diagram of qcd , and the relation of qcd to a possible string construction .",
    "while large-@xmath0 methods offer a route to approach certain qcd - related theories with some analytic control , the large-@xmath0 limit of qcd itself remains unsolved .",
    "this makes lattice studies of this limit quite useful , and indeed these have provided a substantial body of non - perturbative information about large-@xmath0 qcd .",
    "this information plays an important role in guiding and testing the approximate analytic approaches to large-@xmath0 qcd .",
    "one way to approach the large-@xmath0 limit on the lattice is to use a straightforward generalization of the methods used to simulate qcd .",
    "the continuum and infinite volume limits are taken for various values of @xmath0 , and the resulting physical quantities then extrapolated to the large-@xmath0 limit ( typical values of @xmath0 used are @xmath6 , but in some instances larger values , @xmath7 , have been used ) .",
    "in this paper we use a complementary approach commonly referred to as `` large-@xmath0 volume reduction '' .",
    "the original idea was proposed for lattice regulated theories in the seminal paper by eguchi and kawai @xcite .",
    "one considers a `` lattice - like '' matrix model that , under certain assumptions , can be shown to be equivalent to a corresponding ( infinite volume ) lattice gauge theory if @xmath2 in both theories . by `` lattice - like '' we mean a model whose degrees of freedom take values in the group , rather than in its algebra , and that depends on dimensionless couplings and bare masses",
    ". the equivalent lattice gauge theory has the same values for these dimensionless couplings and masses .",
    "the equivalence is thus to a theory with a fixed cutoff , and one must take the large-@xmath0 limit before tuning parameters to take the continuum limit .",
    "the idea of eguchi and kawai has spawned much interesting work demonstrating large-@xmath0 equivalences between different theories .",
    "the two equivalences that motivate our present work are the orientifold and orbifold equivalences of refs .",
    "@xcite . combining these leads to the following result  @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the large-@xmath0 limit of infinite - volume lattice qcd with @xmath8 dirac fermions in the antisymmetric representation is equivalent , for some observables , to the large-@xmath0 limit of qcd with @xmath9 dirac fermions in the adjoint representation defined on a lattice with a finite number of sites @xmath10 .",

    "the latter theory has considerable phenomenological interest because it reduces to physical qcd with @xmath8 fermions in the fundamental representation when @xmath12 .",
    "thus , using the equivalence above , we are able to study a large-@xmath0 limit of qcd that differs from the standard ",
    "t hooft limit .",
    "this alternate limit has the distinguishing feature that fermion loops are present at leading order in the large-@xmath0 expansion .    in order for the combined equivalence to hold several conditions",
    "must be fulfilled  @xcite :    1 .",
    "the ground state of infinite - volume large-@xmath0 qcd with @xmath9 dirac fermions in the adjoint representation must be translation invariant .",
    "2 .   the ground state of infinite volume large-@xmath0 qcd with @xmath8 dirac fermions in the antisymmetric representation must be charge - conjugation invariant .",
    "3 .   the ground state of the large-@xmath0 single - site qcd with @xmath9 dirac fermions in the adjoint representations must be @xmath3 invariant .",
    "this symmetry is the familiar center symmetry in which each of the four polyakov loops that wind around the four euclidean compactified directions is independently multiplied by a @xmath13 factor .",
    "( note that in the single - site model each polyakov loop is composed of a single link matrix . )",
    "it is also necessary that all theories obey cluster decomposition ; the ground state must not be linear combination of vacua that become disjoint at large @xmath0 .",
    "this then implies that multi - trace expectation values factorize at large-@xmath0 .",
    "we do not expect cluster decomposition to fail , but we mention this condition for completeness .",
    "clearly , a crucial question is whether the three conditions listed above actually hold .",
    "we have no reason to suspect that the first two conditions fail , and we assume here that they hold .",
    "the status of the third condition is less clear . in the following we give a brief summary of relevant results in the literature ,",
    "from which we conclude that , while there are some reasons to think that the condition holds , what is needed is a direct study of this issue .",
    "first we note that the third condition fails when the quark masses go to infinity . in that limit",
    "the single - site theory becomes the eguchi - kawai ( ek ) model , for which analytical and numerical results show that the center symmetry is spontaneously broken at weak coupling  @xcite .",
    "this is not necessarily a concern , however , because we are interested in small quark masses , and there are reasons to think that there will be a transition to a phase with restored center symmetry as the quark mass is lowered . in particular , in the limit of zero quark mass , an analysis of the continuum theory on @xmath14 , using weak - coupling techniques that are valid when the radius of the @xmath15 is small enough , finds that the center symmetry ( here just @xmath13 ) is unbroken for small radius  @xcite .",
    "the situation at non - zero quark mass has been discussed in refs .",
    "it appears to us that the conclusion from the last of these papers is that the center symmetry is broken for any non - zero mass when @xmath2 .",
    "we also note in passing that , for very heavy quark masses , the effect of the fermions is to induce extra interactions between polyakov loops wrapping around the compactified direction , and from this point of view , the emergent model is in the class of `` deformed ek models '' suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , for which the center symmetry is unbroken at weak coupling for a judicious choice of its parameters ( for a related study see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "very recently , the calculation in was extended in to lattice regularization using wilson fermions .",
    "the results were promising : the @xmath13 symmetric vacuum was seen to have a lower energy than that of the vacua breaking @xmath16 , for a range of lattice parameters that are physically relevant and that include the chiral point .",
    "the results of also suggest that the center symmetry may be intact even for quite heavy fermions , thus opening a path to study the pure - gauge theory on a lattice with one direction reduced to a point .",
    "we note , however , a caveat concerning the results of : the possibility of more elaborate center - symmetry breaking to nontrivial subgroups of @xmath13 was not considered .",
    "such symmetry - breaking has been found in a different , though similar , set up , in which one uses a continuum regulator in the @xmath17 directions and a lattice regulator in the @xmath15 direction  @xcite . in fact , in this set up the symmetry is found to break even at zero mass .    for completeness , we note that other approaches to large-@xmath0 reduction have been followed in the literature .",
    "most closely related to the present work is the study of ek reduction in the matrix model obtained by dimensional reduction of @xmath5 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( the @xmath18 case discussed below )  @xcite .",
    "this work differs , however , in using a non - compact representation of the gauge fields .",
    "nevertheless , the evidence found in ref .",
    "@xcite that reduction hold for a range of scales is encouraging .",
    "see also the related work in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition , for qcd with quarks in the fundamental representation , whose dynamics in the @xmath2 limit are those of the pure - gauge theory , it has been found that volume independence does hold as long as one does not reduce the length of the box below a fixed physical size of @xmath19  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . other approaches to repair the center - symmetry breaking problem of the ek model , such as the twisted @xcite and quenched @xcite ek models , have been found recently to fail for weak coupling  @xcite .    as can be seen ,",
    "there are no results that directly address our third condition for the single - site model . in principle",
    ", one could extend the perturbative calculation of to the case where all euclidean directions are reduced to a point , but this would require dealing with infrared divergences that arise in the single - site theory .",
    "in fact , even if such a weak - coupling calculation were done , it would not tell us the center - symmetry realization for moderate couplings , where actual lattice calculations are done .",
    "for example , we might find that a weak - coupling calculation points to a @xmath13 broken phase , but that the larger fluctuations in the gauge fields , which occur as the coupling increases , restore the symmetry . alternatively ,",
    "if a one - loop calculation tells us the symmetry is intact , then a sufficiently intricate vacuum manifold could lead to symmetry - breaking at strong enough coupling .",
    "these possibilities are not just academic exercises as both were observed in related models  for example see the phase diagram of the model studied in .    from the discussion above it is clear that a non - perturbative lattice monte - carlo analysis of the single - site model is required , and this is what we perform in this paper .",
    "in particular we focus here on the theory with @xmath20 , which is connected , through the equivalences mentioned above , to physical qcd with two flavors .",
    "our results suggest that the @xmath3 symmetry is intact for a broad range of quark masses including zero .",
    "thus we are studying a theory which is `` within @xmath4 '' of the infinite volume theories appearing in conditions ( 1)-(2 ) above : qcd at large @xmath0 with one dirac fermion in the adjoint representation , qcd at large @xmath0 with two dirac fermions in the antisymmetric representation , and , last but not least , qcd at @xmath12 with two degenerate flavors in the fundamental .",
    "it would also be of considerable interest to study whether reduction holds for other values of @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath18 , the equivalence is , in the massless limit , to the large-@xmath0 limit of @xmath21 susy ( and to qcd with a single dirac flavor ) . for two colors",
    "this susy theory was studied on the lattice by various authors  @xcite ( see also the review in ref .",
    "@xcite and the work noted above on the reduced model in the non - compact theory  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath22 case is of interest as a potential example of a nearly - conformal or conformal theory .",
    "again , for a small number of colors , these theories have been studied on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the following is the outline of the paper . in sec .",
    "[ adjoint ] we discuss qcd with @xmath9 adjoint fermions  the theory that our single - site model is potentially equivalent to .",
    "we define the theory and describe a conjecture for its phase diagram . in sec .",
    "[ small_volume ] , we discuss the corresponding volume - reduced single - site theory  again defining this theory and presenting a conjecture for its phase diagram .",
    "section  [ techniques ] provides some technical details of our lattice monte - carlo simulations of the single - site theory . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we define the observables we measure and use them to map the parameter space of our model , looking for regimes in which the center symmetry is intact .",
    "section  [ results_more ] includes a restricted set of results of physical interest , such as certain eigenvalue densities of dirac operators .",
    "we summarize our study in section  [ summary ] and discuss possible future directions of study .",
    "if reduction holds , the single - site matrix model discussed in the next section is equivalent , at large @xmath0 , to lattice qcd with fermions in the adjoint representation in ( arbitrarily ) large volumes .",
    "here we discuss the properties of the latter theory , so that we know what we should expect to find in the single - site model if reduction holds .    the orbifold construction that underlies this potential equivalence implies that the form of the lattice actions is the same in both the reduced and unreduced theories .",
    "we use the wilson gauge action and wilson fermions for the matrix model , and so discuss below the same action for the large - volume theory .",
    "we thus consider a gauge theory in four euclidean dimensions , with lattice spacing @xmath23 and @xmath24 sites , and whose path integral @xmath25 the gauge action is @xmath26 where @xmath27 labels plaquettes , @xmath28 is product of @xmath5 link variables around the plaquette , and @xmath29 is the inverse ",
    "t hooft coupling that is kept fixed as @xmath0 is increased @xmath30 the @xmath9 dirac fields @xmath31 carry implicit spatial , spinor and adjoint color indices .",
    "we use the lattice wilson - dirac operator @xmath32\\ , , \\label{dw}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 label sites , and @xmath35 is the usual hopping parameter , related to the bare quark mass by @xmath36 the boundary conditions on both gauge and fermion fields are taken to be periodic .    in a literal implementation , @xmath37 would be the adjoint representatives of the @xmath5 matrices @xmath38 appearing in the gauge action . thus @xmath39 would be a matrix of dimension @xmath40 , and @xmath31 an @xmath40-dimensional color vector . we find it simpler to place the fermions in the reducible @xmath41 representation , so that they have @xmath42 color components , and are acted on by @xmath43 matrices . as will be seen shortly , the additional singlet component decouples from the dynamics .",
    "we denote fundamental representation color indices by lower - case letters , e.g. @xmath44 $ ] , and @xmath45 indices by upper - case letters , e.g. @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "we choose a basis in which the latter index is composite : @xmath47 and , correspondingly , in which @xmath48 this acts on a fermion field with indices @xmath49 . by change of basis",
    "we can bring @xmath50 into block diagonal form , with a 1-d block for the singlet , and an @xmath51-d block for the desired adjoint part .",
    "the singlet part is , however , unity for all @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that @xmath53 showing that we obtain the path integral of the desired adjoint theory up to an irrelevant overall constant . to calculate fermionic expectation values",
    "one would , however , need to remove the singlet component .    at tree - level in perturbation theory ,",
    "the quarks become massless when @xmath54 , a result which holds for any representation . at higher order , and non - perturbatively",
    ", @xmath55 is additively renormalized , and the true chiral point occurs at @xmath56 .",
    "this is because wilson fermions break chiral symmetry explicitly for any nonzero lattice spacing .",
    "the physical mass is then given by @xmath57 with @xmath58 a multiplicative renormalization factor that depends on the scheme chosen to define the mass .",
    "this factor is finite and of @xmath59 as long as we consider lattice spacings that are not too small , as we do in practice .",
    "qcd with a single adjoint dirac fermion is asymptotically free ( and quite far from the conformal window explored in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and is expected to confine and spontaneously break its chiral symmetry .",
    "let us first consider the theory with a chirally symmetric regulator . because the fermion representation is real , its global symmetry group in the chiral limit is @xmath60 and not @xmath61 ( for example , see refs .",
    "this symmetry is conjectured to break spontaneously to the flavor group @xmath62 , generating @xmath63 nambu - goldstone bosons . for @xmath20",
    "we therefore expect two massless modes .",
    "the lattice theory , with wilson fermions , respects only the @xmath62 flavor symmetry ( which can be most easily seen by rewriting the action using majorana fermions ) .",
    "chiral symmetry is restored only in the continuum limit , and requires tuning @xmath35 appropriately .",
    "we discuss the situation at finite lattice spacing below when we sketch the phase diagram .",
    "the theory also has a @xmath3 center symmetry , each factor corresponding to multiplying all the link elements @xmath64 on a slice of fixed coordinate @xmath65 in the @xmath66 direction by an element of @xmath13 . since the fermions are in the adjoint representation , they are neutral under this symmetry .",
    "we expect this symmetry to be unbroken for large volumes , as it is in the pure - gauge theory .",
    "the key issue is whether it remains unbroken in small volumes . as discussed in the introduction , analytical arguments in the case of a single short direction",
    "indicate that it will remain unbroken at small volumes if the boundary conditions on all fields are periodic .",
    "this is in contrast to what happens when the fermions have antiperiodic boundary conditions , when we do expect the center symmetry to be broken when one passes through the finite - temperature deconfinement transition as the physical length of one of the directions is reduced .",
    "as far as we know , there have been no lattice studies of gauge theories with @xmath20 adjoint fermions , even for @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "there has been extensive work for @xmath22 , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , both for non - zero temperature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the latter theories are expected to be conformal or nearly conformal , and are not likely to provide useful guidance for the @xmath20 case .",
    "there has also been much work on the @xmath18 , @xmath67 theory with both wilson fermions ( as reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent progress ) and , more recently , domain - wall fermions  @xcite . here , again",
    ", the results do not obviously apply to @xmath20 theories , because the target @xmath18 theory is , in the chiral limit , supersymmetric .",
    "in fact , it may well be that qcd  physical qcd with fermions in the fundamental representation  is the theory whose dynamics is most similar to that of the @xmath20 adjoint theory .",
    "assuming so , we make the educated guess for the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "although we are particularly interested in the large-@xmath0 limit , we expect this sketch to hold also for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "plane for a qcd - like theory with a single dirac adjoint fermion .",
    "details are discussed in the text .",
    ", width=377,height=340 ]    let us explain the features of this diagram .",
    "the solid ( blue ) line labeled @xmath69 , and ending at @xmath70 is the `` critical '' line ( or possibly lines , as discussed below ) along which to the fermions attain their minimal mass .",
    "the continuum limit in which there are light fermions is obtained by approaching the end point of this line ( in a way which depends upon the desired fermion masses ) .",
    "close enough to the continuum limit ( i.e. for large enough @xmath29 ) , the theory in the vicinity of the critical line can be analyzed using chiral perturbation theory including lattice artifacts  @xcite .",
    "the analysis is similar to that for qcd , but must be generalized to the @xmath71 chiral - symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "in fact , the corresponding case for @xmath22 adjoints [ @xmath72 has been worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the generalization to our case is straightforward .",
    "one finds that , as in qcd , there are two possibilities : either there is a line of first - order transitions , at which the two degenerate pseudo - goldstone `` pions '' attain their minimal ( non - zero ) mass , or there are two lines of second - order transitions , at which the masses of both pions vanish . between these second - order lines",
    "lies an aoki - phase  @xcite , in which the @xmath73 flavor symmetry of the lattice theory is spontaneously broken , so that one of the pions is exactly massless , while the other is massive . as @xmath74 ,",
    "the non - zero pion masses in both scenarios go to zero linearly with @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , the width of the aoki - phase , if present , shrinks as @xmath75 .",
    "one can not predict which scenario applies without a non - perturbative calculation , and the result depends on the details of the action .",
    "the numerical results discussed below suggest that the transition is first order ( and thus that @xmath76 is a single line ) for @xmath77 ( which is the smallest value we use ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that , in either scenario , one can approach the continuum limit on either side of the transition(s ) , i.e. with @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",
    "the two sides have identical long - distance physics as @xmath80 .",
    "as one moves to stronger coupling , terms of higher order in @xmath23 become important , and it is possible that one changes from a first - order transition to having an aoki phase , or more exotic possibilities .",
    "once at very strong coupling , @xmath81 , one can show that there will be an aoki phase , and that @xmath82 when @xmath83 .",
    "this is because the analysis of lattice qcd in this limit carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite holds also for the theory with fermions in the adjoint representation .. for @xmath84 , the propagator for this diquark has , in a hopping - parameter expansion , both quarks hopping along the same path , so that gauge matrices completely cancel from the `` pion '' propagator , just as for quark - antiquark pair in qcd in this limit .",
    "one can furthermore show that the dirac - matrix factors are the same in the two calculations .",
    "thus the propagators in the two theories are proportional , and so the corresponding `` pion '' masses vanish at the same @xmath35 . ] because of this , we have shown a region ( solid [ blue ] shading ) of aoki - phase for @xmath85 .",
    "for @xmath86 there will be additional phase structure ( the aoki phase `` fingers '' ) , with additional critical lines along which the continuum theory has more than one light dirac fermions ( four or six , depending along which critical line one takes the continuum ) .",
    "these continuum theories are not asymptotically free , and are not interesting for our purposes of connecting to physical qcd .",
    "thus we have restricted our attention to @xmath87 .    the other feature shown in fig .",
    "[ aoki ] is the approximately horizontal ( red ) dashed line punctuated with question marks .",
    "this indicates a possible `` bulk '' transition , so we label it @xmath88 . for @xmath89 such",
    "a transition is known to be present at @xmath90 ( i.e. the pure - gauge theory ) and to be strongly first - order ( for lower values of @xmath0 it is a crossover ) .",
    "we therefore expect that it persists as a first - order transition line for some distance out into the @xmath91 plane .",
    "we emphasize that this transition is a lattice artifact and so the bare coupling at which it takes place approaches a non - zero ( and non - infinite ) @xmath92dependent value for infinite volume and infinite @xmath0 .",
    "for example , it occurs for @xmath90 at @xmath93 as indicated in the figure .",
    "was measured , for example , by hysteresis scans  @xcite .",
    "a result is also given in ref .",
    "@xcite , but using the simulations of the `` twisted ek '' model , a variation of the ek model that was recently invalidated for large enough values of @xmath0 @xcite . nonetheless , it is possible that reduction holds for the values @xmath94 used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and that the estimate for @xmath95 obtained there is reliable . ]",
    "this transition is also not associated with any symmetry breaking and so can end anywhere in the @xmath96 plane . in the absence of any data",
    "we do not know what happens and so decorate the dashed line by question marks . in any event",
    ", since the continuum limit is at @xmath97 , lattice simulations aiming to approach that limit should be made for @xmath98 .",
    "we now turn to the single - site theory which is the focus of the present work . it is defined simply as the @xmath99 version of the construction in , and is the generalization of the original ek model obtained by adding adjoint fermions .",
    "the degrees of freedom in the model are the four @xmath5 matrices @xmath100 , and the @xmath101-component grassmann variables @xmath31 and @xmath102 . the action of this adjoint ek ( aek ) model is @xmath103\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the purpose of monte - carlo simulations , we formally integrate over the fermions and evaluate expectation values with the following path integral @xmath104}. \\label{zaek}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the relevant symmetries of @xmath105 are the same as those of the original ek model .",
    "they are the remnant of the gauge symmetry @xmath106 as well as center transformations applied independently to the four link matrices @xmath107    as explained in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , large-@xmath0 equivalence holds as long as the @xmath3 symmetry in is unbroken .",
    "we recall here how this equivalence works in detail .",
    "this equivalence states that appropriate expectation values in the reduced theory become identical when @xmath2 to those in the infinite - volume theory defined by .",
    "appropriate expectation values in the large volume theory are the connected correlators of @xmath3-invariant and translation - invariant operators .",
    "these are mapped into operators in the reduced theory following the prescription of refs .",
    "for example , consider the large - volume expectation value of the plaquette , @xmath108 the notation @xmath109 means that we calculate expectation values in the ensemble defined by the partition function in .",
    "@xmath110 is the number of plaquettes , which in four dimensions is equal to @xmath111 .",

    "our conjecture is that this separates a center - symmetry broken phase to the left ( shown shaded ) from an unbroken phase to the right .",
    "this is based on what we know about the ek model , and the assumption that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite apply qualitatively to our model .",
    "( note that there can only be a phase transition when @xmath2 , while for finite @xmath0 this will be smoothed out into a crossover . )",
    "it is possible that this line actually has a non - zero width and contains intermediate partially broken phases .. ] we stress that we do not know the value of @xmath35 at which this line hits the @xmath97 axis , but our conjecture is that this value is smaller than ( likely significantly smaller than ) @xmath122 .    towards the right - hand side of the plot there is another solid ( black ) line which also separates the conjectured central center - symmetric phase from a shaded symmetry - broken phase or phases . here we actually expect a very complicated phase diagram , based on the fact that there are regions where the corresponding infinite volume theory has multiple light fermions ( as discussed above ) , and the results of ref .",
    "since this is not our region of interest , we have not tried to fill in the details .",
    "what is important here is the conjecture that this symmetry - broken region lies ( significantly ) to the right of the critical line ( consistent with the results for ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    given these conjectures ,",
    "we are left with a central `` funnel '' in which reduction holds , and thus have reproduced both the critical `` line '' @xmath69 and the possible bulk transition line from our conjecture for the infinite - volume theory , fig .",
    "the key question for our numerical investigation is whether this central funnel , and in particular its upper part ( where one can take the continuum limit ) is actually present .",
    "we stress again that the precise position of the boundaries of this funnel are supposed to represent only the conjecture that there is a generous region on either side of @xmath76 in the symmetry - unbroken phase .",
    "reduction does not hold in the regions where the @xmath3 is broken .",
    "for this reason we have changed the character of the dashed ( red ) @xmath88 line outside of the central funnel . in particular , we are not aware of numerical evidence for a bulk transition for @xmath90 beyond @xmath123 and did not ourselves observe one .",
    "thus , we end the line away from the @xmath29-axis .",
    "we stress that it is not _ a priori _ known whether there is a bulk transition at all for any value of @xmath35 .    in the next sections we study the theory defined by using non - perturbative monte - carlo simulations , and indeed find a phase diagram similar to that appearing in fig .",
    "[ sketch_pd ] .",
    "we study the path integral in using monte carlo simulations .",

    ", @xmath126 is real and positive , so that @xmath127 can be treated as a probability density .",
    "the reality of the determinant follows as usual from @xmath128 hermiticity ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "positivity follows because the fermion is in a real representation , which allows the action to be rewritten in terms of two majorana fermions , each of which gives a pfaffian when integrated out .",
    "the pfaffian is real , though of indeterminate sign , but its square is necessarily positive  @xcite .    to produce the field configurations we use a standard metropolis algorithm .",
    "following cabibbo and marinari  @xcite , our proposed changes are obtained by multiplying the links by matrices living in @xmath130 subgroups of @xmath5 . for each subgroup",

    "since the cost of calculating the determinant of an @xmath144 matrix scales like @xmath145 , the cost of each of the @xmath130 updates scales like @xmath146 , and the overall cost of a model update scales like @xmath147 .",
    "this means that , for a fixed number of model updates , a calculation with @xmath148 is 25 times more expensive than one with @xmath149 .",
    "our resources for this calculation were very modest  roughly an average of four intel(r ) 6700 @ 2.66ghz cpus .",
    "we did not attempt to parallelize our code , and since we have a single lattice site , it is not clear to us if this is possible . on a single cpu , an @xmath150 calculation including 50 thermalization model updates and 100 measurements ( 550 model updates altogether ) took around @xmath151 hours .",
    "we also found that the asymptotic @xmath147 scaling held to reasonable approximation ( so that gathering 500 model updates in @xmath142 takes about three days , explaining the modest data - set we collected for that gauge group ) .",
    "we note that it may not be necessary to update all the @xmath130 subgroups of @xmath5 in a single model update  such a procedure is perhaps more suitable for pure - gauge models whose computational scaling law is a moderate @xmath152 .",
    "nevertheless , because our calculation is first of its kind , we aimed to be conservative and to avoid auto - correlations between successive measurements to the extent possible .    in the following , all errors have been calculated using the jackknife procedure . in some measurements",
    ", we varied the bin size and chose a value for which the statistical error saturated .",
    "in other measurements , however , we worked with a fixed bin size , and in these cases , based on our experience with variable bin sizes , we multiplied the resulting statistical error by a factor of two .",

    "we observe that the linear and quadratic fits are of comparable quality , indicating that we need a wider range of @xmath0 to pin down the appropriate fitting form .",
    "one can perhaps use the difference between these fits as a crude estimate of the extrapolation uncertainty .",
    "the rather large @xmath162 values in the second row of the table reflect the scatter of our data around the fit lines ( see fig .  [ 2su_inf_figs ] ) and might indicate underestimated statistical errors or a competition between multiple terms in the @xmath161 expansion .",

    "it is argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the eigenvalue densities of the valence dirac operator of the ( partially ) reduced theory are legitimate quantities to be compared with those of rmt as long as @xmath0 is large enough .",
    "specifically , one should expect that the smallest eigenvalues are described by rmt once @xmath168 is large enough .",
    "this can be achieved either by increasing @xmath169 or by increasing @xmath0 .    a particularly useful quantity considered in ref .",
    "@xcite was the distribution , @xmath170 , of the ratio between the first and second eigenvalues of the overlap dirac operator .",
    "this has the advantage , compared to the distributions of individual eigenvalues , that the rmt prediction is parameter - free ( i.e. is independent of the value of the condensate ) .",
    "thus it can be used as a gauge of whether @xmath168 is large enough .",
    "indeed , using this quantity , ref .",
    "@xcite found that the measured @xmath170 agrees with the rmt prediction on an @xmath171 lattice only for @xmath172 . in our case",
    "we have @xmath99 and so we probably need even larger values of @xmath0 in order to see @xmath170 asymptote to the its rmt form .",
    "note that this expectation is justified only for values of @xmath35 that correspond to adjoint fermions heavier than the dynamical scale of the gauge theory .",
    "if the adjoint fermions become light , then their determinant will alter the expected distribution .",
    "we thus calculate @xmath170 for valence overlap fermions ( using the conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite , and taking @xmath173 ) .",
    "since the dimension of the dirac matrix of the fundamental fermions is modest , @xmath174 , we can construct it exactly , without approximating the sign function involved in its definition .",

    "one complication is that our fermion action , which uses the wilson - dirac operator , does not preserve chiral symmetry , so that we can not making a direct comparison with rmt unless we include lattice artefacts .",
    "it may be possible to use the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , to study the condensate .",
    "it also may be possible to use a valence overlap operator for the adjoint fermions .",
    "in this paper we have taken a step towards exploring large-@xmath0 qcd with fermions in two - index representations . in these theories the number of both gauge _ and _ fermionic degrees of freedom grows as @xmath183 , so that the latter contribute to the dynamics even when @xmath2 .",
    "we do not study these theories directly , but rather use large-@xmath0 equivalences to relate them to a much simpler theory , qcd with adjoint fermions defined on a single site .",
    "these equivalences follow from a combination of orbifold and orientifold projections  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we choose to work with a single dirac adjoint fermion which , through these projections , corresponds to a gauge theory with two dirac fermions in the antisymmetric representation .",
    "for @xmath12 the latter theory becomes physical ( @xmath68-color ) qcd with two degenerate dirac fermions in the fundamental representation , and this makes our study relevant phenomenologically .",
    "clearly , for our approach to work it is necessary that the above - noted equivalences hold .",
    "this in turn requires that the ground state of the reduced theory is symmetric under the @xmath3 center - symmetry of the theory .",
    "the present paper is focused on determining , using monte - carlo simulations , the regime in the parameter space of the single - site theory within which the center symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "our simulations were performed with @xmath184 at a variety of lattice spacings and quark masses .",
    "the observables we measure include order parameters for the breaking of @xmath3 symmetry , and in some instances we gather large data samples , allowing the calculation of @xmath185 different order parameters that probe many potential patterns of symmetry - breaking .",
    "we find strong evidence that the center symmetry is intact in an extended region of the lattice parameter space , a region that includes the `` critical '' line along which we expect that the fermions have their minimum mass .",
    "our results for the phase - diagram depend very weakly on @xmath0 , suggesting that they apply also when @xmath2 . in particular ,",
    "the relatively small values of @xmath0 that we use appear large enough to observe the first - order transition line at @xmath76 , despite the fact that this becomes a true transition only when @xmath2 .",
    "our results are consistent with the region of unbroken center - symmetry extending towards the continuum limit , so that the phase diagram is consistent with that conjectured in fig .",
    "[ sketch_pd ] , although we can not rule out that this region shrinks when @xmath186 .",
    "an important finding is that the center symmetry does not break until the physical fermion mass becomes very heavy , likely at the cut - off scale ( in approximate agreement with the analytic estimate ref .",
    "for example , at @xmath164 , where @xmath187 , the symmetry is unbroken for @xmath188 ( see figs .  [ ploop_b0.50 ] and [ ploop_b0.50_n15 ] ) , so @xmath189 \\approx ( z_m / a ) \\times 5 $ ] .",
    "since we expect @xmath190 , the fermion mass is of @xmath191 .",
    "thus there appears to be an overlap of the region in which reduction holds and that in which the long - distance physics of the corresponding large - volume theory is that of large-@xmath0 pure - gauge theory .",
    "this finding opens a window to the study of the pure - gauge theory using reduction , which was the original idea behind the proposal of eguchi and kawai  @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that what is happening here is that the heavy fermions would , if integrated out , induce a tower of interactions between polyakov loops that is similar to the tower of double - trace interactions proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to stabilize the center symmetry .",
    "as already noted , our evidence for the absence of center - symmetry breaking becomes less strong at the smallest coupling we consider , @xmath140 .",
    "this is an extremely small coupling , corresponding to @xmath192 if @xmath12 .",
    "it is much smaller than the values for which we envision performing useful measurements of physical observables ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "the issues that arise at @xmath140 are that there are large fluctuations in monte - carlo time histories , and long auto - correlation times , making it hard to unambiguously determine the equilibrium state .",
    "it is for these couplings that the use of the @xmath185 order parameters becomes particularly useful , allowing us to try and tease out evidence of symmetry - breaking .",
    "we find none .",
    "a general lesson we have learned is that , when shrinking more than one euclidean direction , the center - symmetry sometimes breaks in quite nontrivial ways .",
    "for example , in some parts of the lattice phase diagram we observed ground states for which the expectation values of the polyakov loop are consistent with zero , while other order parameters , which measure correlations between different euclidean directions , have non - zero averages .",
    "this is similar to the behavior we observed in the quenched eguchi - kawai model  @xcite , and shows that it is insufficient to measure only polyakov loops ( or any power thereof ) when studying center - symmetry breaking .    of course",
    ", finding that reduction holds is only the first step .",
    "our ultimate aim is to use the single - site theory as a tool for learning about physical quantities of large-@xmath0 qcd with one flavor of adjoint fermions , and large-@xmath0 qcd with two flavors of fermions in the antisymmetric representation .",
    "reduction allows one to calculate expectation values of wilson loops and connected correlation functions of certain fermionic operators , and thus to determine the string tension and certain `` hadron '' masses , as well as glueball-@xmath194 mixing , _",
    "etc._. from a practical point of view , however , the key question is this : what value of @xmath0 is needed to obtain results with controlled @xmath4 corrections ?",
    "we have made a first step at answering this question by looking at two variables  the average plaquette and the eigenvalue densities of a fundamental - representation massless fermion .",
    "the former is not itself a physical quantity , as it is dominated by ultraviolet fluctuations , but it is simple to calculate and can give an indication of the @xmath4 behavior . while our calculations using @xmath195 can not pin down the form of the @xmath4 dependence ,",
    "it does appear that the results at @xmath148 lie within a few percent of those at @xmath156 .",
    "the eigenvalue densities provide a test of whether the single - site gauge configurations can reproduce the long - distance physics of chiral - symmetry breaking . in particular , in their `` epsilon - regime '' , the low lying eigenvalues of the dirac operator have correlated distributions that are predicted by random - matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "we find distributions which differ significantly from the rmt predictions , and , based on the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , take this as evidence that our values of @xmath0 are too small to probe the epsilon - regime .",
    "it is important to stress that , although we find that @xmath195 are too small for this particular observable , these values of @xmath0 do appear to be sufficient to study the nature of the phase diagram , which is the main goal of this paper .    looking forward , the prospects for using reduction as a quantitative numerical tool clearly depend on developing or implementing algorithms with a less formidable @xmath0 dependence than the @xmath147 scaling of our method",
    "this will allow us to simulate much larger values of @xmath0 , and see if the phase diagram presented in this paper for @xmath196 is indeed indicative of its @xmath156 limit .",
    "we are considering implementing a hybrid - monte - carlo .",
    "it also is clear that to move forward one needs greater computing resources . in that regard ,",
    "one issue to be faced is the lack of any obvious way of parallelizing the code . here",
    "the advantage of reduction  packing as much information as possible into the link matrices  leads to a computational problem .",
    "a less ambitious direction of further study is to make more extensive and systematic measurements of observables on the lattices we already have at hand .",
    "we have in mind in particular studying the correlators of hadrons composed of adjoint representation fermions .",
    "this would allow us to check our hypothesis that the `` critical '' line corresponds to the minimal mass of the pions .",
    "we would also like to measure the eigenvalue densities for adjoint - representation fermions .",
    "these are expected to enter their epsilon - regime for values of @xmath0 that are parametrically smaller than those required in the fundamental fermions case .",
    "finally , we recall that using reduction is also of interest for other values of the number of dirac flavors . in particular , for @xmath18 ,",
    "the chiral limit of the theory is related to the @xmath21 susy gauge - theory , while , for @xmath22 , the theory is perhaps conformal .",
    "if reduction holds for these cases as well , then it provides a method to study the large-@xmath0 limits of these theories .",
