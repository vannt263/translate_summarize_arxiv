    "spin squeezing refers to the reduction of noise in one of the components of the effective spin associated with an ensemble of two - level quantum systems .",
    "there has been a great deal of interest in spin squeezing as a means for reducing the quantum noise that is intrinsic to any precision measurement @xcite .",
    "several methods for achieving spin squeezing have been proposed @xcite , including a recent one of ours involving atoms interacting with a classical field and a quantized , cavity field in a @xmath0 configuration @xcite .",
    "we have shown that , for a sufficiently large nonlinearity ( large cooperativity parameter @xmath4 ) , _ self - squeezing _ is obtained in such a @xmath6-level atomic medium when the input field driving the cavity mode is a coherent state of the radiation field .",
    "maximal squeezing occurs near the points of optical bistability in this system . with increasing cooperativity parameter @xmath4 , the maximum self - squeezing that can be obtained",
    "is about @xmath7 . in this paper , we show that it is possible to increase this limit by modifying the pumping scheme . in effect , we introduce a method for pumping the coherence between the two ground state levels using a double-@xmath0 scheme @xcite .",
    "the double @xmath0 scheme consists of a pair of @xmath0 systems sharing the same set of lower levels .",
    "one of the @xmath0 schemes is designed to produce maximum coherence , @xmath8 , between the ground state levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this _ pumping scheme _ involves equal intensity fields that are resonant with both the one and two - photon transitions of the @xmath0 system and leads to pumping of the dark - state , @xmath9   $ ] .",
    "there is no steady - state absorption of these fields , implying that the fields induce a type electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "the eit fields quantum correlations have been investigated in @xcite , but not the atom - field correlations .",
    "it is not difficult , however , to show that , if the input fields are in a coherent state , the spin associated with levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 resulting from these fields alone is at least as noisy that of a coherent spin state .",
    "hence , eit alone does not produce atomic spin squeezing . in order to squeeze the ground state atomic spin",
    ", we introduce an asymmetry in the system by considering an additional  pair of fields interacting with the second @xmath0 system @xcite . in the combined double-@xmath0 scheme ,",
    "our calculations predict that there is no limit to the spin squeezing that can be achieved ; the variance of one spin component approaches zero asymptotically as @xmath5 for @xmath10 .",
    "we provide analytical calculations of the atomic variance , allowing one to optimize the squeezing and also discuss the process leading to the creation of squeezing , which is new and different from squeezing originating from optical bistability @xcite .",
    "the eit interaction enables one to pump the coherence and increase the spin mean value while the cavity coupling keeps the fluctuations low .    in sec .",

    "note that when the eit interaction is absent ( @xmath124 ) , as well as when it is predominant ( @xmath125 ) , there is little or no squeezing .",

    "the qualitative dependence of spin squeezing can be understood as follows : one must have @xmath128 to produce significant pumping of the coherence @xmath129 ; however , the entanglement of the spins with the cooperativity parameter must be sufficiently large to dominate the fluctuations produced by the pumping fields - this translates into the conditions , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , which are violated for sufficiently large @xmath123 .",
    "note also that for @xmath132 ( eit interaction alone ) , the fluctuations are @xmath120 , and @xmath133 @xmath134 confirming our statement that eit alone does not produce atomic squeezing .",

    "it should be noted that the convergence of @xmath142 to @xmath80 with @xmath4 is rather slow because of the exponent @xmath147 ; increasing the atoms by a factor @xmath148 improves the squeezing by about @xmath6 db .",

    "@xcite , it is interesting to go into the fourier domain from ( [ deltasx])-([deltaeq ] ) and plot the contributions to the atomic spectrum .",

    "the frequency width of the spectra can be found by noticing that , if we are in the bad - cavity limit : @xmath161 , and one eliminates the field fluctuations in ( [ deltaep ] ) and rewrites ( [ deltasy ] ) , the effective time constant for @xmath103 is @xmath162 , which can be made much greater than @xmath163 ( as in fig . 5 ) .      if the cavity field mean value is non - zero , the fluctuations of @xmath99 are coupled to both @xmath164 and @xmath165 and eq .",

    "figure 6 shows the minimal variance versus the cavity field mean value for a given set of parameters .",
    "the squeezing is indeed destroyed when the field amplitude becomes too large .",
    "yet , there exists a substantial range of intracavity intensities that do not destroy the squeezing too much .",

    "in @xcite , the squeezing arose from the non - linear interaction between the fields and atoms in the vicinity of the lower turning point of the bistability curve .",
    "the atom - field system exhibits the analog of a first - order phase transition and that quantum fluctuations are important near the bistable point , allowing for either the field or the atoms to be squeezed .",
    "the critical parameter governing the behavior is the cooperativity parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the underlying mechanism responsible for spin squeezing considered in this paper is rather different from bistability squeezing . rather than originating in a regime where the amplitude of the fluctuations is either big or small , the squeezing can be traced to a region of parameter space where the fluctuations can be made small owing to the cooperative behavior of the atoms due to the cavity coupling . at the same time , the spin mean value increases faster than the fluctuations with increasing eit pumping rate . we can then say that the spin is pumped owing to the eit  interaction , while the fluctuations are kept low by the cavity coupling .",
    "the consequence of this novel effect is that the atomic squeezing no longer saturates at some constant value when one increases the number of atoms .",
    "we would like to point out that the origin of squeezing is rather complex , in the sense that both the cavity coupling and the eit pumping are necessary to produce squeezing , although each scheme , taken alone , does not yield squeezing ; hence our appellation of eit - assisted atomic squeezing .",
    "note that the squeezing can be easily controlled via the eit intensity , and the optimization provided by the rather simple analytical results of the effective system .",
