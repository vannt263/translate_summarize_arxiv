    "hydrodynamics is considered now as the basic part of a spatiotemporal picture of the matter evolution in the processes of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions ( see recent reviews @xcite ) . to complete the description of _ a+a _ collision processes , hydrodynamics must be supplied with a generator of an initial non - equilibrated state , pre - thermal dynamics which forms the initial near locally equilibrated conditions for hydro - evolution , and prescription for particle production during the breakup of the continuous medium at the final stage of the matter expansion .    as for the initial state , since it fluctuates on an event - by - event basis , monte carlo event generators are widely used to simulate it in relativistic @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the most commonly used models of initial state are the mc - glauber ( monte carlo glauber ) @xcite , mc - kln ( monte carlo kharzeev - levin - nardi ) @xcite , epos ( parton - based gribov - regge model ) @xcite , ekrt ( perturbative qcd + saturation model ) @xcite , and ip - glasma ( impact parameter dependent glasma ) @xcite . @xcite . ]",
    "the last model also includes non - trivial non - equilibrium dynamics of the gluon fields which , however , does not lead to a proper equilibration . to apply these models to data description",
    "some thermalization process has to be assumed .",
    "evidently , in order to reduce uncertainties of results obtained by means of hydrodynamical models , one needs to convert a far - from - equilibrium initial state of matter in a nucleus - nucleus collision to a close to locally equilibrated one by means of a reasonable pre - equilibrium dynamics . a relaxation time method @xcite , initially developed for the post - hydrodynamic stage ,",
    "is modified for applications to pre - thermal dynamics .    as for the post - hydrodynamic ( afterburner ) stage ,",
    "good progress was made in understanding and modeling the breakup of hadron matter into hadron gas at the late stage of expansion .",
    "typically , particlization , i.e. , the transition from the hadron ( or quark - gluon ) fluid to hadronic gas expansions , is described by means of the so - called cooper - frye prescription within hybrid models .",
    "in such an approach , the sudden conversion of the fluid to particles happens at a hypersurface of hadronization or chemical freeze - out .",
    "it has long been known that such a matching prescription has problems with the energy - momentum conservation laws when fluid is converted to particles at the hypersurface which contains non - space - like parts ( see up - to - date review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these problems can be avoided by using the hydrokinetic model ( hkm ) that was proposed in ref . @xcite and further developed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in basic hkm ,",
    "particlization is considered not as a sudden , as in hybrid models , but as a realistic continuous process .",
    "in such an approach the description of continuous particle emission from the fluid is based not on the distribution function but on the so - called escape function @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the method of escape probabilities , similar to that used in hkm formalism for post - thermal dynamics , is applied to the pre - thermal one .",
    "it makes it possible to describe the pre - thermal evolution of the energy - momentum tensor using three free parameters : the time of the initial ( non - equilibrium ) state formation , mean relaxation time , and time of thermalization , say , 1 fm / c .",
    "this phenomenological model allows one to provide initialization of the hydrodynamical evolution , and is a more general and simple alternative to the so - called `` anisotropic hydrodynamics '' @xcite , as discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the target energy - momentum tensor of the pre - thermal dynamics of _ a+a _",
    "collisions , which the initially created system reaches during evolution , is the tensor of viscous relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the further evolution is governed by the equations of the israel - stewart framework of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics until the lowest possible temperature when the system is still close to local thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "it defines the hypersurface which is often called the chemical freeze - out isotherm .",
    "the particlization procedure starts typically at this very hypersurface .",
    "the hypersurface contains non - space - like parts that formally enforce one to use the hkm continuous particlization procedure , to eliminate the problem with violation of the energy - momentum conservation .",
    "however , with almost smooth ( averaged ) initial conditions , the effects originated from these parts are quite small and do not affect significantly the observables @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional areas of non - space - like parts are small , and for large times the hydro - velocities at the corresponding parts are large .",
    "] moreover , in viscous hydrodynamics the effects of violation of local equilibrium , which is produced in hkm for an ideal fluid , are partially taken into account .",
    "therefore , summarizing all that and accounting for very time consuming calculations in hkm , we will use in this paper the sudden transition from hadron matter to hadron gas , similar to the hybrid models . in future studies we plan to include the option of continuous hkm particlization for situations when undesirable contributions from non - space - like parts are fairly large : it can be for @xmath3- geometry observables and event - by - event analysis .",
    "considering also that an important component of the full model is the pre - thermal evolution where the description is built on the same idea as the basic hkm formalism , we will call the complete model , which includes generation of the initial state , its thermalization , sudden ( with the possible option of `` continuous '' ) particlization , subsequent ultrarelativistic qmd ( urqmd ) hadronic cascade @xcite , and one- and multi- particle spectra formation , the integrated hydrokinetic model ( ihkm ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 includes subsections that describe the ingredients of the complete ihkm .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the results and discussions , while the section 4 summarizes the physical meaning of obtained results .",
    "as discussed in the introduction the integrated hydrokinetic model ( ihkm ) consists of five ingredients which we describe below .",
    "though prethermal dynamics is used to initialize hydrodynamics , it itself needs the initial state of the matter at the starting time @xmath4 , say @xmath5 or 0.5 fm / c , when one can speak about energy density distribution in non equilibrated matter .",
    "following ref .",
    ", an appropriate scale controlling the formation of gluons with a physically well - defined energy is roughly @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are dimensionless parameters , which is the variance of the gaussian weight over the color charges @xmath9 of partons .",
    "the estimate of this time gives @xmath5 fm / c for the top energy available at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and @xmath10 fm / c for the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) full energy @xcite .",
    "we will utilize @xmath5 fm / c as the default value for the lhc energy @xmath11 tev ; however , we will use also @xmath12 fm / c to analyze the corresponding variation of the results .",
    "we attribute the initial state to the time @xmath4 .",
    "the generation of the initial state is based on the glissando 2 @xcite package .",
    "this package works in the frame of the semiclassical glauber model . within this approach at the very initial stage of the collision , individual interactions between nucleons deposit transverse energy .",
    "each deposition of the transverse energy at a certain space - time point or region is called a source and each source has its weight which is called relative deposited strength , or rds .",
    "the normalization of rds can be treated as an insertion of the additional parameter .",
    "we choose its value in such a way that all charged - particle multiplicity distribution , obtained in ihkm for 5% most central collisions , fits its experimental value .",
    "the rds may be different for the wounded nucleons and the binary collisions , and it can fluctuate from source to source .",
    "we use a mixed model , amending the wounded nucleon model with some binary collisions . in this model",
    ", a wounded nucleon obtains the rds of @xmath13 and a binary collision has the rds of @xmath14 .",
    "the total rds , averaged over events , is then @xmath15 .",
    "of course , the result of simulations fluctuates from event to event . in this paper",
    "we do not study fluctuations of observables , and will simulate inclusive observables basing on the approximation of the averaged initial state for each centrality class .",
    "this approximation implies that for each selected centrality only the one hydro run is performed .",
    "the simulation of a single event is made in three stages :    1 .",
    "generation of the positions of nucleons in the two colliding nuclei according to the fluctuating nuclear density distribution .",
    "the form of the mean distribution depends on the mass of nuclei @xmath16 . for sufficiently large nuclei",
    "this distribution has a woods - saxon form with an account of nuclear deformations , the latter are small in our case of pb+pb collisions .",
    "generation of the transverse positions of the sources and their rdss .",
    "3 .   calculation of the physical quantities and writing the results in the output file .    in order to obtain the initial conditions from the rds",
    ", one can put the rds to be proportional to energy or entropy .",
    "we choose it to be proportional to energy because entropy is not created yet in a non - equilibrium initial state .",
    "then , for the initial state averaged over many events with a chosen centrality bin , one can write ( @xmath17 is the impact parameter associated with centrality ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a fitting parameter defining the maximal energy density of the initial state that is reached at minimal centrality , say 05% ( @xmath20 ) , at @xmath21 .",
    "the value @xmath19 and @xmath14 are the same for all centrality classes .",
    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath14 are fixed by the reproduction of the charged - particle multiplicity at different centralities .",
    "the generation of the initial energy density configuration with the help of glissando is supposed to be followed by a thermalization process . as we have already discussed in the introduction",
    "we describe the matter evolution at the pre - thermal stage with the relaxation model @xcite .",
    "we assume a longitudinal boost invariance , which is a good approximation for the central rapidity region of the fireball at high collision energies .",

    "[ fig : aproton1 ] ) , one can see that the basic scenario is not the best one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aproton1 ] ) . that is why",
    ", if one compares the mean values of @xmath128 over all observables in table 1 , this scenario brings slightly worse results than scenarios with an isotropic initial state and anisotropic one with larger relaxation time . at the same time",
    "the last two scenarios do not describe the enhancement of soft pions as we already discussed .",
    "let us apply ihkm to a description of elliptic flows .",
    "the elliptic flows in ihkm are associated with the reaction plane that is well - defined in glissando 2 .",
    "we compare the results with the experimental @xmath115-coefficients estimated with four - particle cumulants measured for unidentified charged particles as a function of transverse momentum for various centrality classes , @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : v2 ] demonstrates all charged - particle @xmath115-coefficients for the basic scenario in comparison with ihkm results with @xmath119 instead of @xmath92 and also with ideal hydro starting at @xmath136 fm / c .",
    "one can see that the two last scenarios lead to poorly described @xmath115-coefficients . at the same time",
    "the basic scenario , as well as the ihkm one with @xmath12 instead of @xmath5 fm / c and also the viscous pure hydrodynamics scenario with @xmath136 fm / c describe the data quite satisfactorily , see fig .",
    "[ fig : v2_2 ] .",
    "however , the two last scenarios describe the spectra worse : the one with @xmath12 , at fairly large @xmath133 ; the other , the pure viscous hydro , at both large and small momenta .",
    "coefficients for centrality classes 05% , 510% , 1020% , 2030% , 3040% , 4050% and 5060% , obtained in the ihkm basic scenario ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mult ] ) .",
    "the results are compared with those in ihkm at the other parameter dissipation condition , @xmath119 instead of @xmath140 and with ideal hydro with the starting time @xmath141 fm / c for centrality classes 510% , 1020% , and 2030% .",
    "the experimental data are from @xcite.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    , but the results are compared with those in ihkm at the other initial time , @xmath12 fm / c instead of @xmath142 fm / c and with viscous hydro at the starting time @xmath141 fm / c.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    an important observation for evolutionary models is the interferometry radii that reflect the space - time structure of the particle emission from an expanding fireball .",
    "the detailed study within ihkm shows that if a selection of some set of parameter values , such as @xmath4 , @xmath57 , @xmath110 , @xmath143 , is accompanied by the renormalization of the maximal initial energy density @xmath19 , similar to that in table 1 , to keep the ihkm charged - particle multiplicity to be equal to the experimental one , the interferometry radii change within a few percent only , which is a much smaller change than the one caused by a change in the centrality class of the collision .",
    "published results ( see , e.g. review @xcite ) have shown that the interferometry radii depend on particle species , multiplicity , and initial system size .",
    "the other details are not so important .",
    "dependence on transverse momentum for different centralities in the ihkm basic scenario under the same conditions as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mult].,scaledwidth=80.0% ]     dependence on transverse momentum for different centralities in the ihkm basic scenario under the same conditions as in fig .",

    "[ fig : rout][fig : rlong ] we present the pion interferometry radii in the ihkm basic scenario for three different centralities .",
    "in general the radii are described well except some small deviation for @xmath144 and @xmath145 from the central experimental points ; these deviations are oppositely directed for these transverse radii , which results in slight overestimation of the @xmath145 to @xmath144 ratio , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rors ] .",
    "the integrated hydrokinetic model ( ihkm ) of _ a+a _ collisions is developed .",
    "it includes the generation of the initial ( generally momentum anisotropic ) state , matter evolution at the pre - thermal stage leading to thermalization , subsequent viscous hydrodynamic expansion , particlization , and hadronic cascade urqmd .",
    "this model is applied to describe at different centralities the mid - rapidity charged - particle multiplicities , the pion , kaon , and antiproton spectra , the @xmath115 coefficients for all charged hadrons , and the pion interferometry radii in pb - pb collisons at lhc with @xmath94 tev .",
    "it is found that a quite satisfactory description of the bulk observables can be reached when the initial states are attributed to the very small initial time 0.1 fm / c , the pre - thermal stage ( thermalization process ) lasts at least until 1 fm / c , and the shear viscosity at the hydrodynamic stage of the matter evolution has its minimal value , @xmath1 .",
    "the requirement of satisfactory description of the soft pion enhancement phenomenon also leads to the further discrimination between the ihkm scenarios , namely , the initial state should be maximally momentum anisotropic and have a small mean relaxation time , @xmath146 . in this basic scenario",
    "the bulk observables are described in a wide @xmath133 region , including the pion and antiproton spectra , as well as their yields when annihilation processes at the afterburner ( urqmd ) stage are taken into account @xcite .",
    "it is worthy noting that while the found tendencies , which direction the changes of spectra and @xmath115 values go when changing the basic model parameters , are probably stable , an accounting of event - by - event fluctuations , as well as modification of such important factors as eos and particlization temperature , can change the numerical values of the model parameters , ensuring an optimal description of the observables .",
    "such an investigation is the subject of subsequent work .",
    "another important point which we would like to stress is the approximate similarity of the results at different reasonable values of the main parameters of the model , even including the pure hydrodynamic scenario starting from @xmath147 fm / c .",
    "the reason for such similarity is probably that each change of basic parameters is accompanied by a re - normalization of the maximal energy density of the initial state , to keep the agreement with the experimental multiplicity of all charged particles at midrapidity .",
    "then , at the same particlization temperature for all the scenarios , the main characteristics of the bulk observables are approximately preserved .",
    "of course , some details are different , as ihkm demonstrates , but the variations are not so dramatic .",
    "this observation explains satisfactory agreement of different variants of hydrodynamic and hybrid models with the experimental data for a+a collisions , especially when not all bulk observables are considered .    in this paper the monte carlo glauber model",
    "is used for the generation of the initial state . the profile from glissando",
    "is associated here with the one for energy density of the non - equilibrium and non - thermal initial state .",
    "note that the entropy density can not be used to characterize such a state at @xmath5 fm / c .",
    "the interesting point is that with such treatment of the monte carlo glauber model , the share of the binary collisions , contributed to the total energy density , is constant at about 1/4 for lhc energies at _ different _ ihkm parameters .",
    "we are planning to utilize other initial state models , such as epos and ip - glasma , which have other structures of the initial state and already fixed values of the maximal initial energy density , as the generators of the initial states in ihkm .",
    "the comparison of the models have to be done on an event - by - event basis and include besides spectra , their anisotropy and femtoscopic scales for different hadron pairs , as well as fluctuations of the observables .",
