    "the willingness to pay for a product is increased by advertisements @xcite .",
    "advertising is used to reinforce the brand image as it is used as an indicator of quality and makes services such as telecommunications more tangible to consumers . indeed , turnbull et al .",
    "@xcite found advertising to be quite an important source of information when purchasing a mobile phone , but not as important as family and friends . at the same time",
    ", mobile telephony is the most heavily advertised business in many countries @xcite .",
    "it seems that the operators are aware of the power of advertising . and",
    "since they can not influence social relations directly , they are doing the second best thing  advertising .    but what affects consumer decisions more ?",
    "is it social influence or advertising ?",
    "the aim of this paper is to build a model of the mobile telecommunications market in poland , where three major operators ( _ plus _ , _ era _ and _ orange _ ) fight an on - going battle for domination . to tackle this problem we introduce two models of opinion dynamics in oligopoly markets , which differ in the way the two forces influencing consumer choice  ( local ) social interactions and ( global ) advertising  interact .",
    "we study the general behavior of the models : steady states in terms of market shares for the entire space of parameters , as well as calibrate them to real data .",
    "hopefully , the obtained results will add to the understanding of oligopoly market behavior and help in answering the above question .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section we provide a short overview of the mobile phone market in poland . in section [ sec : themodel ] we discuss the factors influencing our choice of the mobile operator and introduce two opinion dynamics models .",
    "we conclude the section by presenting mean field equations for both models . in section [ sec : theresults ] we present the obtained results both in terms of monte carlo simulations and mean field approximations .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude and discuss possible follow - up research .",
    "mobile telephony in poland dates back to 1992 , when ptk ( brand _ centertel _ ) started offering services in the analog nmt450i system .",
    "the first mobile phones were the ` bricks ' ( nokia cityman 450 ) and the ` radiators ' ( motorola 2000 , talkman 900 ) .",
    "their price exceeded the average annual salary at that time . in the early 1990s mobile phones were the synonym of success in the rapidly developing polish economy .",
    "second generation services ( gsm 900 mhz ) were offered in 1996 by two new operators  ptc ( brand _ era _ ) and polkomtel ( brand _ plus _ ) . only then ,",
    "through competition and the policy of subsidizing mobile phones have they become more popular .",
    "centertel started loosing clients due to worser quality of transmission and bulkier handsets and in 1998 decided to launch a digital system of its own  _ idea centertel _ ( rebranded to _ orange _ in 2005 ) working in the gsm 1800 mhz system . in late 1998",
    "all three operators made a next major step forward and introduced prepaid services .",
    "this move eventually led to mobile phones becoming everyday appliances .",
    "in 2000 the operators received concessions for new frequencies and since then all three have used both the 900 and 1800 mhz systems .",
    "this was a great opportunity especially for _ idea centertel _ , which has been using the shorter range , city - concentrated gsm 1800 mhz system and had three times fewer clients than the two competitors . the next major technological change ",
    "introduction of the third generation umts telephony in 2004  did not have a noticeable impact on the market . even today there are not too many users of this system . in march 2007 a fourth player entered the market ",
    "p4 ( brand _ play _ ) , but by the end of 2007 its market share was still negligible ( @xmath1 in terms of the number of users and @xmath2 in terms of net revenues ) .    during the last 15 years the number of mobile phone users has been steadily increasing . in 2007",
    "the number of sold sim cards exceeded 40 million yielding a market penetration of 108.6% ; the penetration by active sim cards was estimated at 90.9% @xcite .",
    "compared to other european countries this is not a spectacular result .",
    "the mobile phone market is a typical example of an oligopoly .",
    "entry barriers ( including infrastructure and concessions ) are extremely high . as of end",
    "2007 there were four operators in the polish market @xcite :    * polkomtel s.a .",
    "( brand : _ plus _ , prepaid brands : _ simplus _ and _ sami swoi _ ) * polska telefonia cyfrowa sp .",
    "( brand : _ era _ , prepaid brands : _ tak tak _ and _ heyah _ ) * polska telefonia komrkowa centertel sp .",
    "( brand _ orange _ ; includes prepaid services ) * p4 sp .",
    "( brand _ play _ ; includes prepaid services )    there were also a few mobile virtual network operators ( mvno ) ",
    "brands _ mbank mobile _ , _ myavon _ , _ wpmobi _ , _ simfonia _ and _ ezo _  but their market share was negligible ( @xmath3 in terms of the number of users and @xmath4 in terms of net revenues as of end 2007 ) .",
    "in this paper we study the period from the end of year 2000 , when the technological constraints of the three major operators were leveled out , till the third quarter of 2007 , see figure [ fig : sim_income ] .",
    "we will only consider these three players ( and generally denote them later in the text by their main brands  _ plus _ , _ era _ and _ orange _ ) as the remaining operators have not played a visible role in the studied period .",
    "for a long time these three players have fought an on - going battle for domination in the polish mobile phone market . but",
    "despite the competition , they have sustained relatively high prices for their services and tempted new clients with cheap handsets instead ( similar strategies have been observed in other markets as well @xcite ) .",
    "only when the market has saturated ( 2004 - 2005 ) , the operators have started attracting the less rich clients .",
    "first , by lowering the prices for prepaid connections , next by lowering the prices for subscription ( postpaid ) services . the latter move has reversed the dominating trend  instead of offering cheap handsets",
    "the operators have started luring clients with cheap connections .",
    "apart from the service - handset price competition , the operators have always fought a war on the billboards and in radio , tv and internet commercials .",
    "in fact , in the last ten years the three major mobile market players have been the most heavily advertised companies in poland . nearly every week",
    "they make the top ten list , if not the top three .",
    "mobile phone ads are visible everywhere and it is hard to imagine a new market entry without an intensive advertising campaign .",
    "writing about the polish mobile telecommunications market we have to mention the controversial events related to the dispute over 48% of shares of ptc ( owner of the brand _ era _ ) .",
    "four companies were involved in this : elektrim , elektrim telekomunikacja , deutsche telekom and vivendi . the dispute started in 1999 , when elektrim bought 15.8% of shares from other shareholders ( kulczyk holding and bre bank ) . at the same time , another shareholder ",
    "deutsche telekom ( dt )  was convinced that it had the preemtion right to those shares and in december 2000 filed a case in the arbitrage court in vienna .",
    "legal actions ended in november 2004 .",
    "in the meantime , the shareholder structure changed and the sentence did not hurt electrim but a french company vivendi . in 1999",
    "vivendi bought 49% of shares of elektrim telekomunikacja ( et ) , a company to which elektrim transferred its ptc shares in 2000 . in 2001",
    "vivendi bought another 2% of shares of et gaining control not only over et but also over ptc .",
    "however , the arbitrage court ruled that the transfer of shares from elektrim to et was illegal .",
    "the provincial court in warsaw ( sad rejonowy w warszawie ) recognized this decision and 48% of ptc shares returned to elektrim .",
    "and then all the fuss began .    in february 2005",
    "the provincial court in warsaw made changes in the national company register ( krajowy rejestr sadowy , krs ) , including a new board of directors and a new supervisory board appointed by elektrim in cooperation with dt .",
    "et and vivendi did not accept this , which resulted in a blockade of ptc s headquarters by the former management .",
    "vivendi also filed a complaint to the polish government , backed by a bilateral agreement between france and poland on observance of international investments .",
    "after some time the new board of directors gained control over ptc s offices and elektrim started negotiations with dt and vivendi on the sale of ptc s shares . however , in august 2005 the roles changed : the district court in warsaw ( sad okrgowy w warszawie ; playing the role of the court of appeal for the provincial court ) reversed the decision of the lower instance and sent the case back to the provincial court in warsaw . in november 2005",
    "the provincial court made changes in krs in favor of et .",
    "this time the elektrim and dt appointed board blocked ptc s headquarters .",
    "a number of managing directors resigned .",
    "ptc started to have liquidity problems .    .",
    "the processes are not identical , however , contrary to some reports @xcite they are not that different ( the correlation for individual companies ranges from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) .",
    "_ right panels : _ market structure in terms of grp and advertising expenditures.,width=453 ]    it seems that the case was finally resolved in march 2006 , when the warsaw court of appeal ( sad apelacyjny w warszawie ) upheld the sentence of the arbitrage court in vienna from november 2004 .",
    "the situation of ptc stabilized , although courts of different instances were still processing the case for two more years . during this turmoil _",
    "era _ lost its pole position in the mobile phone market in poland ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_income ] ) .",
    "this happened despite the fact that advertising remained high , both in terms of advertising expenditures and gross rating points ( fig .",
    "[ fig : grp_invest ] ) . some authors @xcite consider the gross rating points ( grp ) , i.e. the percentage number of targeted viewers contacted times the average number of contacts per targeted viewer , to be much more representative of the actual advertising campaign . in our case",
    ", however , the advertising expenditures and grp numbers yield a very similar picture .",
    "also the correlation between these two variables is very high and for individual companies ranges from @xmath5 to @xmath6 in the studied period .",
    "a march 2006 survey performed by pbs ( www.pbsdga.pl ) , a polish market research company , sheds some light on the discord between ptc s market share and advertising expenditures .",
    "nearly 40% of respondents ( and over 55% of corporate respondents ) declare that news of an uncertain future of the company would make them change the operator .",
    "also over 30% of respondents would change the operator if serious charges were brought against the company s management .",
    "we generally prefer to make decisions consciously . in an attempt to make the best choice possible",
    "we study the operators offers : special deals , price plans , offered handsets , loyalty programs , network coverage and quality of transmission .",
    "especially subscription clients spend long hours on studying and weighting these factors . quite often , however , the offers are very similar when we take all factors into account and it is very hard to make a decision based only on simple statistical comparisons .",
    "economic and social studies suggest that the decision of a consumer to purchase a particular product depends not only on price and product quality , but also on social effects and advertising exposure @xcite .",
    "moreover , links in a social network and the stream of advertisements may lead to common actions of large groups of consumers and induce correlation between consumers decisions @xcite .",
    "on one hand , the social validation phenomenon is a powerful motivation for our actions .",
    "people listen to their family and friends experiences of network operators , price plans and brands of handsets .",
    "turnbull et al .",
    "@xcite found family and friends to be the main source of information used by uk consumers when purchasing a mobile phone .",
    "a similar effect was observed in the thai market @xcite .",
    "note that tariffs add to this clustering effect by giving preferences ( including lower prices ) to connections within a network or even within a group of friends .    on the other hand",
    ", according to becker and murphy @xcite the willingness to pay for a product is increased by advertisements .",
    "this implies that when a positive news arrive at a consumer , they raise his / her perception of utility of that brand .",
    "advertising is used to reinforce the brand image as it is used as an indicator of quality and makes services such as telecommunications more tangible to consumers .",
    "indeed , turnbull et al .",
    "@xcite found advertising to be quite an important source of information when purchasing a mobile phone in the uk ( but not as important as family and friends ) . at the same time",
    ", mobile telephony is the most heavily advertised business in many countries , see section [ sec : themarket ] and ref .",
    "it seems that the operators are aware of the power of advertising . and",
    "since they can not influence social relations directly , they are doing the second best thing  advertising .      from the previous section we know that social influence plays a major role in selecting a mobile phone company . but",
    "can we be more precise and say which type of influence is more and which is less important for the decision making process ?",
    "in the early 1950s solomon asch reported an ingenious series of experiments on social influence ( for a fascinating review see levine @xcite ) .",
    "asch used several measures of social influence but here we recall only two of his results @xcite , which help us answer the question ` which aspect of the influence of a majority is more important  the size of the majority or its unanimity ? '",
    "asch found that minority participants confronting a unanimous majority were often capable of resisting social influence .",
    "when a subject was confronted with only a single individual who contradicted his answers , he was swayed little : he continued to answer independently and correctly in nearly all trials . when the opposition was increased to two ,",
    "the pressure became substantial : minority subjects now accepted the wrong answer 13.6 % of the time . under the pressure of a majority of three , the subjects errors jumped to 32 % . but",
    "further increases in the size of the majority apparently did not increase the weight of the pressure substantially .",
    "clearly the size of the opposition is important only up to a point .",
    "asch also found that he could increase independence dramatically  the presence of a social supporter reduced the total number of yielding responses from 32% to 5.5% @xcite .",
    "the power of social support was further demonstrated in a study showing that participants were far more independent when they were opposed by a seven - person majority and had a partner than when they were opposed by a three - person majority and did not have a partner @xcite .",
    "a number of later experiments showed that an individual who breaks the unanimity principle reduces social pressure of the group dramatically @xcite .",
    "this observation was recently expressed in a simple one dimensional usdf ( ` united we stand , divided we fall ' ) model of opinion formation @xcite .",
    "the model was later renamed ` the sznajd model ' by stauffer et al .",
    "@xcite and generalized on a two dimensional square lattice .",
    "the crucial difference between the sznajd model and other ising - type models of opinion dynamics @xcite is that information flows outward from the center nodes to the surrounding neighborhood ( so called outflow dynamics @xcite ) and not the other way around .",
    "ising - type models with outflow dynamics have been successfully applied in marketing , finance and politics ; for reviews see @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to build a model of the mobile telecommunications market in poland , where three major operators ( _ plus _ , _ era _ and _ orange _ ) fight an on - going battle for domination .",
    "the market is represented by a two dimensional @xmath7 lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each site of the lattice is occupied independently by an individual ( a customer ) , who is characterized by a variable @xmath8 , that represents his / her mobile operator . in each time step ( @xmath9 )",
    "one of the @xmath10 customers is selected randomly ( random sequential updating ) and then together with his / her three neighbors forms a @xmath11 panel .",
    "we measure the time so that the speed of all processes remains constant when @xmath12 , and thus one update takes time @xmath13 .",
    "two forces influencing consumer choice are considered : ( local ) social interactions and ( global ) advertising .",
    "some empirical studies @xcite suggest that of the two forces social interactions play a greater role . following the unanimity principle discovered by social scientists",
    "we assume that only an unanimous panel ( all four customers in the panel use the same mobile network ) persuades all eight of its nearest neighbors to switch the operator to the one favored by the panel . in lack of unanimity",
    "the eight neighboring individuals make their choice based on advertisements : independently with probability @xmath14 each of them switches the operator .",
    "the choice of the operator is determined by the relative advertising level ( a kind of an external field @xcite ) . with probability @xmath15 he / she chooses company @xmath16 ( say , _ plus _ ) , with probability @xmath17 company @xmath18 ( _ era _ ) and with probability @xmath19 company @xmath20 ( _ orange _ ) .",
    "obviously , the customer may ` switch ' to the same operator , i.e. , stay with the original one . in this model conformity ( social influence )",
    "comes in first , then advertising affects the customers .",
    "hence , we will call the model  conformity first ( cf ) .",
    "a different idea of incorporating advertising in a duopoly setting was proposed by the social psychologist andrzej nowak at the giacs summer school ` applications of complex systems to social sciences ' @xcite .",
    "he suggested to generalize the usdf model by flipping each up opinion down ( @xmath21 ) with probability @xmath22 and each down opinion up ( @xmath23 ) with probability @xmath24 as a result of global effects like advertising through mass media .",
    "the traditional conformity rule was applied to each of the neighbors ( of the panel ) independently with probability @xmath25 . in this model ( called ` nowak - sznajd ' by wooszyn et al .",
    "@xcite ) conformity influences individuals parallel to advertising .",
    "we borrow nowak s idea to construct our second model and call it cap ( conformity and advertising parallel ) .    in the cap model , for each of the the eight nearest neighbors of the selected panel we independently apply either the social ( with probability @xmath26 ) or advertising ( with probability @xmath14 ) forces .",
    "all neighbors selected to be influenced by social interactions switch the operator to the one favored by the panel , but only if the panel is unanimous . in lack of unanimity",
    "the selected neighbors do not perform any action . the remaining neighbors ( selected to be influenced by advertising )",
    "are subdued to the same rules as in the cf model .",
    "namely , the choice of the operator is determined by the relative advertising level : with probability @xmath15 the individual chooses company @xmath16 , with probability @xmath17 company @xmath18 and with probability @xmath19 company @xmath20 .",
    "note , that in contrast to the cf model , in the cap model an unanimous panel does not guarantee conformity .",
    "let us denote by @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 the number at time @xmath30 of _ plus _ s , _ era _ s and _ orange _ s customers , respectively .",
    "further , define by @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 the respective market shares ( concentrations ) .",
    "of course , the normalization condition is fulfilled , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "we measure the time so that the speed of all processes remains constant when @xmath12 , and thus one update takes time @xmath13 .",
    "each basic time step @xmath35 consists of @xmath10 updatings , hence the balance ( evolution ) equation takes the form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the incremental and decremental changes are ( slightly ) different in the two models . for instance , in the cap model the number @xmath27 of _ plus _ s ( operator # 1 ) clients can increase in time due to the following events :    * an _ era _ client ( operator # 2 ) follows _ plus _ s advertising  the probability of such an event is equal to @xmath38 ; * an _ orange _ client ( operator # 3 ) follows _ plus _ s advertising  the probability of such an event is equal to @xmath39 ; * an _ era _ client subdues to the unanimous panel of operator # 1  the probability of such an event is equal to @xmath40 ; * an _ orange _ client subdues to the unanimous panel of operator # 1  the probability of such an event is equal to @xmath41 .    similarly , the number @xmath27 of _ plus _ s clients can decrease in time due to the following events :    * a _ plus _ client follows _ era _ s advertising  the probability of such an event is equal to @xmath42 ; * a _ plus _ client follows _ orange _ s advertising  the probability of such an event is equal to @xmath43 ; * a _ plus _ client subdues to the unanimous panel of operator # 2  the probability of such an event is equal to @xmath44 ; * a _ plus _ client subdues to the unanimous panel of operator # 3  the probability of such an event is equal to @xmath45 .",
    "now , we can put down the balance equation for the first operator : @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] dividing both sides of the equation by @xmath10 and denoting @xmath47 by @xmath48 and @xmath49 by @xmath50 , for @xmath37 , after simple algebraic transformations we obtain : @xmath51 applying the normalization conditions ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) we obtain the complete set of evolution equations for the cap model : @xmath54 , \\nonumber\\\\ c'_2 - c_2 & = & ( 1-p)(h_2-c_2 ) + pc_2 \\left[c_1(c_2 ^ 3-c_1 ^ 3)+c_3(c_2 ^ 3-c_3 ^ 3 ) \\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\ c'_3 - c_3 & = & ( 1-p)(h_3-c_3 ) + pc_3 \\left[c_1(c_3 ^ 3-c_1 ^ 3)+c_2(c_3 ^ 3-c_2 ^ 3 ) \\right ] .",

    "note also , that the sets of evolution equations ( [ eqn : mfa : cap ] ) and ( [ eqn : mfa : cf ] ) can be easily solved numerically , see the discussion in section [ sec : theresults ] .",
    "recall from section [ sec : themarket ] that back in year 2000 ( beginning of the study period ) three mobile operators were offering their services in the polish market : a ` new entrant ' ( _ orange _ ; until 2005 under the brand _ idea centertel _ ) was challenging two incumbents ( _ plus _ and _ era _ ) .",
    "the market shares of the two incumbents were nearly the same in terms of income ( ca .",
    "40% each ; see the bottom right panel in figure [ fig : sim_income ] ) , but not in terms of the number of sim cards sold .",
    "following woszczowska @xcite , in this study we use income as the measure of market share .",
    "there are two major reasons for this .",
    "first , the published data concern the number of sim cards sold , not the actual number of users of a given network . some of the cards are not active and some clients are using more than one sim card ( private , business , internet ) .",
    "second , different categories of clients use the phones with different intensities .",
    "this could be accounted for by assigning more lattice sites to some clients , but for the sake of parsimony we have decided not to execute this option .",
    "consequently , in our model one lattice node represents an average ( in terms of income ) client .",
    "the market state where a new entrant challenges two incumbents of the same size allows us to make further simplifications .",
    "we limit the rich parameter space ( @xmath57 ) to the situation where the initial concentrations of clients and the levels of advertisement of _ plus _ and _ era _ are equal , i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "for the sets of rules governing the behavior of mobile phone users ( see section [ ssec : buildingthemodel ] ) , we study the system via monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and compare the final steady states with those obtained from the mean field approach ( mfa ) , see equations ( [ eqn : mfa : cap ] ) and ( [ eqn : mfa : cf ] ) .      we present results for lattice size @xmath60 , although we have performed simulations for other @xmath61 s .",
    "in all simulations we took initially @xmath62 of _ plus _ customers , @xmath62 of _ era _ customers and @xmath63 of _ orange _ customers randomly distributed on the lattice .",
    "the level of advertisement @xmath64 is the same for _ plus _ and _ era _ and constant throughout the simulations . for _ orange",
    "_ the level is equal to @xmath65 .    during the simulations ,",
    "we have observed that after a transient ( ` termalization ' ) time @xmath66 the concentrations ( market shares ) reach a final level @xmath67 around which they fluctuate .",
    "due to these fluctuations , we define the final value of concentration as the mean value over a time interval @xmath68 : @xmath69 for both models ( cap and cf ) , the final steady state @xmath67 was reached in all performed simulations independently of the parameters ( @xmath70 ) and the initial conditions ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "moreover , averaging over different @xmath68 s ( 10 , 50 , 100 ) did not influence the results . for each set of parameters ( @xmath71 ) we performed @xmath72 independent monte carlo simulations and calculated @xmath73 by averaging over all samples .",

    "substantial differences between the studied models can be seen . for the cap model ( see the left panel in figure [ fig : fig_c_inf1_n ] ) , the dependence between final concentration @xmath67 and advertising level @xmath64 is almost linear , but generally @xmath75 is an s - shaped function of @xmath64 .",
    "deviations from linear dependence increase with @xmath26 .",
    "a different behavior is observed for the cf model ( see the left panel in figure [ fig : fig_c_inf1_s ] ) .",
    "a critical value @xmath76 of the advertising level exists : @xmath77 in the ` high conformity ' regime ( @xmath78 ) , the final steady state @xmath67 depends not only on conformity and advertising , but also on initial concentration @xmath62 .",
    "nevertheless , in the cap model the dependence between @xmath67 and @xmath64 is still an s - shaped function and no critical value of @xmath64 exists ( see figure [ fig : fig_c_inf2_n ] ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the cf model for which @xmath76 exists ( see figure [ fig : fig_c_inf2_s ] ) .",
    "for @xmath79 the dependence between the final and initial concentration grows with conformity level in both models .",
    "this is an understandable result , because for high values of @xmath26 interactions between individuals dominate over the external field ( advertising ) . on the other hand , for high values of @xmath26",
    "the dependence between @xmath67 and @xmath64 should decrease . in the limit ( @xmath56 )",
    "only interactions between customers exist and there is no external field , thus no dependence on @xmath64 is expected .",
    "this is confirmed by mc results ( see figures [ fig : fig_c_inf2_n ] and [ fig : fig_c_inf2_s ] ) .      in section [ ssec : mfa ]",
    "we have derived general sets of evolution equations describing how concentrations change in time for both models .",
    "these sets of equations can be easily solved numerically .",

    "then the mfa equations ( [ eqn : mfa : cap ] ) and ( [ eqn : mfa : cf ] ) lead to the final fixed point @xmath80 independently of the parameters ( @xmath81 ) . in agreement with mc simulations ,",
    "the mfa equations lead to two regimes depending on conformity level @xmath26 :    * for @xmath74 the final steady state @xmath67 does not depend on initial concentration @xmath62 , i.e. it is function of only two parameters @xmath75 , see figures [ fig : fig_c_inf1_n ] and [ fig : fig_c_inf1_s ] . * for @xmath78 the final steady state @xmath67",

    "this similarity indicates a mean field character , i.e. lack of spacial fluctuations , of the cap model . on the contrary , for the cf model mfa results",

    "most importantly , there is no critical value of @xmath64 within the mean field approach .",
    ", width=453 ]    monte carlo results show that , generally , the relationship between market share and advertising level is less straightforward for the cp model due to stronger clusterization caused by a greater role of social validation .",
    "fluctuations within the cp model were able to ` produce ' a critical phase transition in terms of advertising .",
    "below the critical value @xmath83 ( of incumbents advertising ) only the entrant survives .",
    "the existence of fluctuations is the reason why mfa for the cp model does not give as compatible results as for the cap model .",
    "it should be noticed that although a critical value of advertising does not exist within the mfa , mfa results still give more complicated dependences between market share and advertising for the cp model than for the cap model .",
    "up till now we have been investigating general features and differences between cap and cp models . we have found that generally the cf model is more interesting from a statistical physics point of view .",

    "the levels of advertising @xmath85 were set to the respective percentages of total advertising expenditures for the 27 consecutive quarters ( @xmath86 ) , see the bottom right panel in figure [ fig : grp_invest ] , with one important change .",
    "namely , due to the turmoil around _ era _ ( see section [ ssec : turmoilera ] ) , _ era _ s advertising levels @xmath87 were decreased in the years 2005 - 2006 ( @xmath88 ) by 10% , a value that was found to best represent the inefficiency of advertising in the turmoil period @xcite . finally , the time scale had to be set .",
    "we have decided to take such a number of time steps @xmath89 as to allow each client to change operator once every two years ( on average ) : @xmath90 .",
    "the rationale for this comes from the fact that in poland the standard agreement for subscription customers concerns a two year period . to simplify calculations",
    "the number 4219 was replaced by 4212 , which is divisible by 27 .",

    "in this paper we have introduced two models of opinion dynamics in an oligopoly market .",
    "we have applied them to a situation , where a new entrant challenges two incumbents of the same size .",
    "two forces influencing consumer choice were considered : ( local ) social interactions and ( global ) advertising . in the conformity first ( cf ) model , conformity  but only in the case of unanimity  comes in first , then advertising affects the customers . a different idea of incorporating advertising , borrowed from @xcite , was used to build the conformity and advertising parallel ( cap ) model , where conformity influences individuals parallel to advertising .",
    "we have studied the general behavior of the models : steady states in terms of market shares for the entire space of parameters , as well as calibrating models to real data . for studying the steady states we have used both the mean field approach and monte carlo simulations .",

    "it occurred that both techniques gave very similar results for the cap model , which indicated the lack of spacial fluctuation within this model .",
    "moreover , the dependence between the final value of market share @xmath67 and the level of advertising @xmath64 was relatively simple and for small values of conformity level @xmath26 it approached a linear function @xmath82 . on the contrary , for the cp model mfa gave qualitatively different results from mc simulations .",

    "existence of the critical value is very interesting from the social point of view  below a certain critical level of @xmath64",
    "the market approaches a lock - in situation , where one market leader dominates the market and all other brands disappear .",
    "groot @xcite associates such a market with a situation when consumers tend to copy the behavior of their neighbors ( high conformity level ) and want the best value for their money , while an open market arises when consumers ignore what their friends buy ( low conformity level ) . in our models",
    "the dependence between final market shares and the level of advertising becomes less straightforward with increasing conformity",
    ". for low conformity levels advertising becomes the main force of market changes .",
    "furthermore , robertson and gatignon @xcite point out that incumbents have an advantage over new entrants , but firms without a responsive defense strategy may forfeit that advantage ( this happens in the cf model below the critical advertising level ) .",
    "we have also calibrated the models to real data from the polish telecommunications market .",
