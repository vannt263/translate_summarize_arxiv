    "galaxies are not spherical objects .",
    "although it is difficult to measure the intrinsic shapes of astronomical bodies from their projected light distributions , inferences can be make from their observed ellipticities .",
    "many studies of the distribution of observed axis ratios of galaxies and galaxy clusters (  ryden , 1992 , 1996 ; tremblay & merritt 1996 ) have shown that they are well represented by a population of intrinsically triaxial objects . similar statistical analysis performed by alam & ryden ( 2002 ) with a much larger sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey early data release",
    "has strengthened the claim that the observed distributions of ellipticities can not be fit by projections of oblate or prolate spheroids .",
    "this type of analysis is only available in the cases where the mass distribution creates light .",
    "the shapes of dark matter halos , therefore , must be inferred from even more indirect means .",
    "proxy measures of the shape of our own halo offer widely varying results .",
    "the tidal stream of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy implies a nearly spherical halo ( ibata  2001 ) , in contrast to the results of star counts , which give a minor to major axis ratio of @xmath5 0.6 ( siegal  2002 ) .",
    "the dark matter halos created in numerical studies of structure formation are non - axisymmetric systems .",
    "@xmath0-body simulations of dissipationless collapse in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario by dubinski & carlberg ( 1991 ) showed that the resulting virialized halos deviated substantially from spherical symmetry and from axisymmetry , with average axis ratios @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the major , intermediate , and minor axes respectively .",
    "simulations of larger cosmological volumes , which more adequately reproduce the hierarchical nature of structure formation in cdm , have also shown that dark matter halos are triaxial ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; warren 1992 ) .",
    "analysis of the currently favored @xmath11cdm cosmology has shown similar results ( jing & suto 2002 ) .",
    "the simulations cited above consist only of a collisionless dark matter component and include no gas dynamics .",
    "the introduction of a gas and stellar disk in the equatorial plane of the halo would certainly have effects on the internal structure of the halo .",
    "fully self - consistent cosmological simulations of dissipational structure formation have problems reproducing more than general galactic attributes (  murali  2002 ) , and the resulting halo shape has not been the focus of these efforts .",
    "however , dubinski ( 1994 ) showed that the adiabatic growth of a disk - like potential in a triaxial halo did not influence @xmath12 , while the intermediate to major axis ratio was only slightly increased to @xmath13 .",
    "models and simulations of disk galaxies , however , usually employ spherical halos , which do not reflect these results from cdm simulations . the purpose of most current investigations of galaxy - scale simulations has been modeling transformations of galaxies through major mergers (  barnes 1992 ; dubinski , mihos , & hernquist 1999 ) , minor encounters (  struck 1997 ; thakar & ryden 1998 ) and gas - dynamical effects (  mihos & hernquist 1996 ; springel 2000 ) .",
    "the triaxiality of the halo does not immediately effect the results of these simulations and the implications of using triaxial halos have not been explored .",
    "early studies of the stability of disk galaxies ( e.g. ostriker & peebles 1973 ; hohl 1976 ; efstathiou  1982 ) demonstrated that a cold , rotationally supported disk is dramatically unstable to bar formation .",
    "this fact was used as justification for the existence of heavy , spherical , dark matter halos enveloping disk galaxies .",
    "this dynamically hot component of the galaxy inhibits bar formation .",
    "it has also been shown that a dense core gives a galaxy an inner lindblad resonance , which does not allow swing amplification of waves through the center of the galaxy and thus acts as a bar suppressant ( sellwood 1989 ) . in all cases",
    "the stabilizing mass component has been assumed to have spherical symmetry .",
    "if these galaxies were enveloped by triaxial halos , they would be more susceptible to bar instabilities .",
    "a systematic exploration of the stability of disks with non - axisymmetric halos has not been conducted .",
    "curir & mazzei ( 1999 ) presented fully self - consistent gas - dynamical simulations of disk galaxies with triaxial halos , but only used two halo models and did not employ bulges .",
    "the resolution in their simulations was severely limited ( @xmath14 ) , far less than the number of particles used by efstathiou  ( 1982 ) which sellwood ( 1989 ) found to be insufficient .",
    "the notion that the potential field of a galaxy may contain non - axisymmetric features is not a new one ; it is , in fact , readily apparent from the bars seen in many galactic disks .",
    "the effect of an oval distortion , like a bar , on a gas disk has been proposed as a driving mechanism for spiral density waves ( lin 1970 ) .",
    "this idea has been explored numerically as well ( sanders & huntley 1976 ; sanders 1977 ; huntley  1978 ) .",
    "these early simulations generally were limited to two - dimensional , massless disks driven by an analytic distortion to the symmetric potential , but were successful in creating significant spiral response in the disk . however , bar forcing does not reproduce tightly bound spiral patterns . and in comparison to sanders & huntley ( 1976 ) , the response of the outer disk is weak when a more realistic bar potential , one that drops off faster with radius , is used in the simulation ( sanders & tubbs 1980 )",
    "observationally spiral patterns are as common in barred galaxies as galaxies without bars . also , there is evidence that bars and spiral arms have different pattern speeds , showing that one feature may not drive the other ( sellwood & sparke 1988 ) .",
    "a triaxial halo would not be subject to these concerns since the potential of the dark matter would dominate the outer regions of the disk , especially low mass disks which are stable to bar formation .",
    "the bulge - to - disk ratio of a spiral galaxy , as well as the tightness of the spiral pattern , are two integral criteria of the hubble classification scheme . on the average , there exists a smooth increase in pitch angle with later hubble types ( kennicutt 1981 ) .",
    "such a correlation , however , is little more than a consistency check between classification parameters , and there exists significant scatter in the measured pitch angle for a given hubble type .",
    "even with this scatter , the correlation between arm pattern and galaxy type has prompted several theoretical studies on the origin of the this relation ( see kennicutt & hodge 1982 , and references therein ) .",
    "kennicutt ( 1981 ) found that the correlation between pitch angle and maximum rotational velocity of the disk was as good as the theoretical model predictions , suggesting that the mass distribution and its resulting rotation curve is an important determinant in producing the shape of spiral arms .",
    "a more massive or more concentrated bulge will induce higher rotation velocities and loosely follow the correlation with hubble type as well .",
    "our simulations include a collisionless stellar disk and a stiff , rotating halo .",
    "most simulations include a bulge , which is also stiff .",
    "our use of dissipationless simulations with halos which are not fully self - consistent allows us to cover a significant range of parameter space for all three galaxy components ; the disk , bulge , and halo .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows :  2 presents our initial conditions as well as the @xmath0-body techniques used in this study .",
    " 3 shows the analysis and results of our fiducial simulation .",
    " 4 describes our suite of different galaxy models . in  5",
    "we investigate the stability of our models with different halo and bulge masses , as well as different halo rotation rates .",
    " 6 presents our results for the spiral morphology of our simulations .",
    "we present results for models which follow the bulge - to - disk ratios of the hubble sequence and models which vary widely in rotation velocity .",
    "we compare our results to observations of spiral galaxies .",
    "the positions and velocities of the disk particles are initialized in the method outlined by hernquist ( 1993 ) .",
    "the density distribution of the disk is described by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are cylindrical coordinates , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the scale length and scale height of the disk , and @xmath20 is the total mass of the disk . the circular velocity and velocity dispersions are obtained from    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is radial acceleration , @xmath26 is the surface density of the disk , @xmath27 is the epicyclic frequency and @xmath28 is the angular rotation rate .",
    "the radial acceleration in equation ( 2 ) is the total acceleration contributed by the self - gravity of the disk , the dark matter halo , and a spherical bulge .",
    "the normalization of the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath29 , is obtained by requiring @xmath30 at a specified radius @xmath31 to be a multiple of the critical dispersion at that radius :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is toomre s parameter for gravitational stability in a rotationally supported disk . the disk models in this paper",
    "are defined to have @xmath34 at @xmath35 , which in the milky way galaxy would be approximately the solar radius .",
    "the rotational velocity of each particle is then given by    @xmath36    the different halo models used in this paper can be represented by dehnen s ( 1993 ) @xmath37-models ;    @xmath38    where @xmath37 is the interior logarithmic slope of the density profile and @xmath39 is the scale length of the halo .",
    "a model with @xmath40 corresponds to a model proposed by hernquist ( 1990 ) for bulges and elliptical galaxies .",
    "a spherical hernquist model is used here to represent the bulges of our galaxies .",
    "dubinski & carlberg ( 1991 ) showed that the hernquist model is a good fit for cdm halos , and is close to the general density profile for dark halos found by navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 ) , which also asymptotes to @xmath41 at small radii .",
    "the @xmath37-models can be generalized to triaxial systems by replacing the radial coordinate @xmath42 with @xmath43 , where    @xmath44    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are once again the principal axes of the system .    in practice ,",
    "the disk - particle positions are sampled from the density function in equation ( 1 ) , the accelerations on each particle from the different galaxy components are computed , and then the velocity dispersions and the rotational velocity of each particle are calculated .",
    "the peculiar velocities of each particle are sampled from gaussian probability distributions with dispersions given by equations ( 3)-(5 ) . because @xmath27 and @xmath28 in equations ( 5)-(7 ) are assumed to be azimuthally symmetric , the velocities for the disk particles are computed assuming that the halo is spherical ; therefore when the disk models are placed inside a triaxial halo they are initially out of equilibrium .      to compute the self - gravity of the disk particles , we have employed  ( springel , yoshida , & white 2001 ) , a tree code based on the hierarchical algorithm of barnes & hut ( 1986 )",
    ".  employs a spline - softened force calculation that is expanded to quadrupole order for particle - cell interactions .",
    "the timesteps are continuously varying and individual for each particle .",
    "the spatial and time resolutions are set by the smoothing length , @xmath45 , and the timestep accuracy parameter , @xmath46 . for simulations with @xmath47 , which are the majority of the simulations in this paper ,",
    "these parameters were set to @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the gravitational contribution of the halo is computed by the self - consistent field ( ) method of hernquist & ostriker ( 1992 ) .",
    "this method is based on the expansion of the galaxy potential in an orthonormal set of basis functions .",
    "the accuracy of the potential calculated is driven by the number of terms in the expansion .",
    "the numbers @xmath50 and @xmath51 determine the number of radial and angular basis functions used .",
    "the integration time , however , is a linear function of the number of terms as well .",
    "we found that the best balance of accuracy and speed was achieved with @xmath50=16 and @xmath51=10 , which were the values used in all the simulations .",
    "the zeroth - order basis function was chosen to be the hernquist profile , and the coefficients of the expansion were computed by monte carlo sampling of the halo density distribution , @xmath52 . since the coefficients only have to be calculated once for each halo model ,",
    "accurate calculations can be made by initially sampling a large number of particles from each halo profile , @xmath53 particles .",
    "the  method has been used frequently to model triaxial systems (  merritt & quinlan 1998 ; holley - bockelmann  2001 ) . when comparing the force on a set of test particles calculated from the  coefficients with the force calculated from direct summation over the particles used for the coefficients , the rms error was @xmath54 .",
    "this error level was maintained in models where @xmath37 was not equal to unity .",
    "the contribution to the potential of the galaxy from the bulge can be computed analytically .",
    "therefore , the total acceleration of each particle is given by    @xmath55    the first term is the acceleration returned by  from walking the tree of disk particles .",

    "if a bar is present , it is defined as existing within the rings that have phases which are coherent to within 10% .",
    "the bar strength is the maximum fourier component within this coherence and is denoted by the symbol @xmath3 .",
    "the rings are 0.1@xmath18 in width and contain several thousand particles each . to be considered a valid detection , the coherence must be at least 5 rings in length but does not have to begin at the center - most ring some simulations with obvious bars do not begin having coherent phases until @xmath118 . from this method",
    "we can determine the amplitude , length , and pattern speed of the bar .",

    "the bar pattern speeds do not appear to correlate with either  or 2max .",
    "the simulations that develop strong bars all have bar pattern speeds near 0.5 radians per unit time ( in the same units as ) . the pattern speeds do not change on average once the bar has reached its peak amplitude . since our simulations employ a static halo potential our results do not reflect the dynamical friction and angular momentum transfer that would surely occur in physical galaxies , reducing the pattern speed ( debattista & sellwood 2000 ; valenzuela & klypin 2002 ) .",
    "although in some simulations the peak in the fourier spectrum is well defined and narrow , in others a simple search for the maximum value of @xmath126 can vary significantly in time if there is more than one peak in the spectrum .",
    "pitch angles in spiral galaxies are known to vary with radius and are measured as an average value ( kennicutt 1981 ) . therefore , to quantify the morphology of the spiral structure in our simulations we calculate an average value of @xmath46 , summed from @xmath127 and weighted by the fourier amplitude at each value of @xmath46 .",
    "the simulations for which this quantity , , were calculated did not contain bars as defined in  5 , and so using @xmath87 as the starting point of the weighted average does not bias the results to smaller values of . only amplitudes greater than half the rms amplitude in that range are actually counted in the summation . the value of  varies in time about a mean value at a level of @xmath5 5 - 20% .",

    "the results show little difference between all four realizations , showing that one realization at the fiducial resolution , although not ideal , is adequate for our results .",
    "the clear trend in the top panel of figure[pave - t ] is that decreases with decreasing mass ratio .",
    "figure [ aave ] shows the value of  plotted against mass ratio for all the models listed in table 2 .",
    "the results for  = 0.09 have smaller error bars than those for  = 0.06 because of the higher amplitude of the fourier spectra for  = 0.09 . for both sets of simulations ,",
    "the value of  is maximum at the fiducial mass ratio of 0.76 and decreases as the mass ratio gets bigger or smaller . as expected from the results of figure [ om - results ] , the data for  = 0.09",

    "the caustic structures seen in the high - resolution run of the fiducial simulation are seen throughout the disk and are highly elliptical .",
    "differential rotation has caused the oval caustics to overlap and create a spiral pattern .",
    "the third set of models described in  4 , those with varying bulge mass , can be thought of as an ersatz hubble sequence , at least along one dimension of the required criteria .",

    "the arms themselves vary in thickness ; the larger the bulge mass , the narrower the spiral arms . for the model with @xmath132 ,",
    "the spiral arms can be traced to within one scale radius of the center .",
    "for @xmath133 , the arms do not begin until outside two scale radii ( although a high - resolution simulation could reveal structure inside this radius , as it did for the fiducial simulation ) .",

    "the plot shows a linear increase in  with @xmath137 .",
    "as the bulge mass increases , the spiral arms become tighter .",
    "the pitch angles for the simulations with = 0.105 are systematically higher than those with = 0.075 .",
    "plotted as well are data taken from kennicutt ( 1981 ) for the pitch angles of galaxies along the hubble sequence , from sa - type to sc - type .",
    "the bulge - to - disk ratios corresponding to these classifications were taken from kppen & arimoto ( 1990 ) .",
    "the scatter in the observations , mentioned at the top of this section , is easily apparent .",
    "the simulation data , however , follow the average trend of pitch angle with hubble type .",
    "the slopes of the simulation data are flatter than that of the observations .",
    "several explanations are viable for explaining this : the simulated hubble sequence created here is artificial since it only varies one parameter , the bulge mass",
    ". there could be systematic variations of total galaxy mass and length scales along the hubble sequence which could effect the spiral response of the disk .",
    "only two values of  were used , and the steeper slope of the observations could be reproduced if it were assumed that higher bulge mass correlated with lower halo rotation rates .",
    "lastly , our definition of , since it is an average over a range of @xmath46 , would tend to return values that are closer to the center of that range , reducing the slope of the correlation .",
    "the pitch angles in kennicutt ( 1981 ) were measured by obtaining the arm coordinates from h@xmath46 or blue continuum observations and plotting these coordinates on the log @xmath42 vs @xmath78 plane .",
    "a straight line was fitted to each arm and the results for the two main arms were averaged .      as noted above , a better predictor than hubble classification of spiral pitch angle",
    "is the rotational velocity of the galaxy ( kennicutt 1981 ) .",
    "the relation found in the kennicutt paper is plotted by the solid lines in figure [ vrot ] .",
    "these lines represent the mean and upper and lower bounds on his data .",
    "the slope and intercept of these lines were calculated by inspection , and are not meant to be quantitatively compared to our simulation results .",
    "qualitatively , however , it is obvious that our simulations follow the same relation",
    ". both sets of bulge simulations lie well within the bounds set by the observations .",
    "what is remarkable as well is that the simulations listed in table 2 also show this trend .",
    "the simulations with the lower rotation velocity generally have higher pitch angles .",
    "although the halo - dominated models do not return the same pitch angles as the disk - dominated models with the same rotation velocity , the trend is still preserved regardless of whether the mass dominating the kinematics is from the halo or the disk or the bulge .",
    "the scatter in our results lies within the scatter seen observationally .",
    "the lowest rotation velocity in the models listed in table 2 is d5 , with @xmath138 .",
    "to explore the response of systems with even lower velocities , we used the models described at the end of  3 with both low mass disks and halos .",
    "three different bulge masses were used : @xmath139 0 , @xmath123 and @xmath140 .",
    "the first two of these models developed a strong and a weak bar respectively .",
    "the method of bar detection used in  4 allowed us to eliminate the particles that contribute to the bar from being used in calculating .",
    "since the length of the bar is known , all particles with radii below the bar length were simply not counted in the summation in equation ( 12 ) .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ vrot ] , and they follow the observational relation",
    ".    a tighter correlation can be acheived by including what we know of the mass distribution and halo rotation .",
    "figure [ energy ] plots against the `` normalized '' rotational energy of the halo , a dimensionless quantity given by    @xmath141    where @xmath142 is energy , @xmath143 is the maximum rotation velocity of the disk also used in figure [ vrot ] , and @xmath144 is the total mass of the galaxy .",
    "the energy in the right hand side of equation ( 16 ) is the rotational energy of the halo , @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the moment of inertia of the halo .",
    "the subscript @xmath147 on the energy and the total mass represents the radius at which these two quantities are calculated .",
    "the four windows in figure [ energy ] plot  against  calculated at four different values of @xmath147 .",
    "the correlation is apparent in all four panels , but is excellent for @xmath148 .",
    "the choice of @xmath147 significantly influences the slope of the correlation , with smaller values of @xmath147 resulting in steeper slopes .",

    "the quantity  has a power - law dependence on @xmath147 , which is highest with the low - velocity models .",
    "thus the values of  for that set will be affected most by changes in @xmath147 .",
    "we have presented simulations of galaxy disks embedded in rigid , rotating , triaxial halos .",
    "we have constructed a suite of models in which the masses of the disk , bulge and halo have all been varied . with these models , the effects of changing the halo rotation rate and flattening have been investigated .",
    "our results have focused on the formation of bars and spiral structure .",
    "models with a mass ratio  @xmath149 and  @xmath150 develop a strong bar , even if a significant bulge is present .",
    "for all models , the torque created by the halo induces spiral structure in the disk .",
    "the average pitch angle of this structure , , is strongly anti - correlated with the maximum rotation speed of the model .",
    "it is clear that estimations of the stability of disk galaxies can not ignore the shape of the halo .",
    "models with significant amounts of dark matter and a significant bulge ( like d1 and d2 , which have rotational velocities of over 200  in our system of units ) can become bar dominated with halo rotation rates of  = 0.09 and greater .",
    "maximal disk models , like d5 , are very susceptible to bar instabilities if torqued by the halo . in all the simulations presented in  5 , the only set of halo and bulge parameters for which models d3d5 were stable against bar formation was @xmath2 and  = 0.06 .",
    "even with those parameters , model d3 still developed a low amplitude but persistent bar .",
    "a simple criterion for determining whether a disk galaxy will develop a bar , such as that determined by efstathiou  ( 1982 ) , is not readily apparent from the data . with more free parameters , @xmath58 , @xmath60 , and , in our simulations",
    ", it may be that a simple criterion can not quantify the stability of all our models used in our simulations .",
    "the correlation of rotational velocity and pitch angle in our models provides a physical explanation of the same correlation found in observations of spiral galaxies .",
    "the pitch angle of the arms induced by an external torque is related to the total mass of the system , loosely through @xmath151 , but more tightly to the dimensionless rotational energy parameter .",
    "the differences seen in our results for different halo rotation rates and flattenings fit well with the amount of scatter seen in the correlation of @xmath151 with  for real galaxies",
    ". this result does not have to be unique to the properties of a galaxy s halo ; it has been shown that encounters with satellite galaxies , which would also create a time - varying potential field in which to disrupt the disk , induce two - armed spiral structure in disk galaxies (  toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "but encounters with smaller galaxies are by their nature transient and it remains that spiral structure is a ubiquitous feature of disk galaxies both with and without satellite perturbers .    in kennicutt ( 1981 ) , and references therein",
    ", the properties of the spiral arms are measured through their blue light , usually from hii regions , dust lanes , or the blue continuum , all of which are associated with star formation .",
    "our collisionless simulations better represent the red stellar population which accounts for most of the mass in a galactic disk .",
    "images of spiral galaxies in the near infrared have shown that spiral structure is evident in old stellar populations ( eskridge  2002 ) . the arms observed are smoother and wider than those seen in blue light , but generally follow the same morphology .",
    "the fourier decomposition method used in this paper has been applied to observational data of hii regions in spiral galaxies ( puerari & dottori 1992 ; garca - gomz & athanssoula 1993 ) . the fourier spectra obtained resemble in many ways the spectra of our simulated galaxies , often with several distinct peaks inside one spectrum .",
    "the pitch angle was calculated by these authors from the value of @xmath46 for which the amplitude is highest .",
    "this definition of @xmath85 reproduces the general trend with hubble type as described by kennicutt ( 1981 ) but does not reflect the natural variations in pitch angle within a single galaxy seen both in the fourier spectra of the observations and in kennicutt s calculations .",
    "kennicutt noted that the variations of @xmath85 for a typical galaxy were significantly larger than the measurement error .",
    "an average value of the pitch angle better represents the multiple spiral components .",

    "their simulations contained a disk fully composed of gas particles and a halo 100 times more massive than the disk , effectively making the disk massless .",
    "our collisionless simulations show spiral structure in the inner regions of galactic disks",
    ". since gas fractions in disk galaxies are usually no higher than 30% , the gas should be gravitationally coupled to the stars and follow the spiral patterns seen in our simulations .",
    "the dissipation and subsequent star formation in the gas would lead to self - consistent spiral structure which would outlast a collisionless disk and work to preserve its structure as well .",
    "an open question is the correct value or range of values to use for .",
