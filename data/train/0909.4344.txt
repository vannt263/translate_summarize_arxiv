    "particle physics is now entering the era of the lhc : the experiments that will soon be running at this accelerator are expected to shed light on the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and establish whether new particles and interactions are present .",
    "however , the high center - of - mass energy utilized by the lhc is not the only method to access new physics ( np ) ; this can also be done at lower energies by studying decays of heavy flavors ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , and @xmath2 leptons ) with large data sets .",
    "the latter type of experiment is known as a `` flavor factory '' or often a `` @xmath1 factory '' due to the prominent role played by @xmath1 meson decays in understanding the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa weak mixing matrix . in the lhc era",
    ", there is a unique and complementary role played by a flavor factory , and currently two groups are proposing to build such facilities : belle - ii  @xcite in japan , which is an upgrade of the belle experiment  @xcite , and superb  @xcite in italy , which is an evolution of the babar experiment  @xcite .",
    "these proposed experiments will nominally record 20 - 50 times the amount of data recorded by belle and babar , with the goal of addressing the following issues : are there more than three generations ?",
    "why are quark masses so different ?",
    "why is there such an unusual pattern of ckm weak coupling strengths , and what causes the phase in the ckm matrix ? is this the only phase present ? given the small amount of   violation observed in @xmath3 and @xmath1 decays , why is our universe overwhelmingly matter - dominated ?",
    "a flavor factory can search for np in  asymmetries , inclusive decay processes , rare leptonic decays , absolute branching fractions , and other processes not easily accessible at the lhc .",
    "a flavor factory probes processes that occur at 1-loop in the standard model ( sm ) but may occur at tree level in np scenarios ; such sm - loop processes probe energy scales that can not be accessed directly at the lhc .",
    "if supersymmetry is in fact observed at the lhc , a crucial question will be : how is it broken ? by making detailed studies of flavor couplings , a flavor factory can address this .",
    "most scenarios of new physics can be classified as either supersymmetric theories , little higgs models , models with extra dimensions , left - right models , or strongly coupled models  @xcite .",
    "all of these have implications for flavor physics .",
    "for example , consider the @xmath4 gluino - squark diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : generic_loop ] .",
    "this diagram can give rise to neutral meson mixing .",
    "by dimensional considerations , the effective four - quark operators governing such mixing must have the form @xmath5 ^ 2 $ ] plus other possible chirality structure , where @xmath6 is the energy scale associated with np , and @xmath7 is a np wilson coefficient of @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding term in the sm , e.g. , for @xmath9-@xmath10 mixing , is @xmath11 ^ 2 & \\approx &   \\frac{(\\sin^3\\theta^{}_c)^2}{(2\\times 2.5~{\\rm tev})^2}\\ , [ \\bar{d}^{}_{l}\\gamma^{}_\\mu b^{}_{l}]^2\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : np}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since we do not yet observe np effects , the np operator must be less than the sm term  , or equivalently @xmath12  tev . the fact that this scale is much larger than the weak scale is a manifestation of the `` flavor problem : '' new physics needed at the tev scale to stabilize the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale must have a highly non - generic flavor structure .    for most np models , the coupling strengths across generations are not predicted . if one assumes that the only source of flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) is the yukawa couplings and there is no _ a priori _ reason why this should be so then the fcnc are ckm - suppressed .",
    "for example , for @xmath9-@xmath10 mixing @xmath13 ^ 2\\ , , \\label{eqn : mfv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies @xmath14  tev .",
    "this scenario is known as `` minimal flavor violation . ''",
    "although it substantially lowers the scale at which np could appear , the scale remains higher than what the lhc can comfortably probe .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we discuss five types of measurements for which a flavor factory has excellent potential for identifying np if present : _ ( a ) _ measuring mixing phases ; _ ( b ) _ measuring decay phases ; _ ( c ) _ detecting a charged higgs via leptonic decays ; _ ( d ) _ identifying new physics via @xmath15 transitions ; and _ ( e ) _ determining how supersymmetry is broken via measurements of @xmath16 ( a combination of weak and decay phases ) . here",
    "we limit our discussions to @xmath1 decays , but a flavor factory also produces prodigious amounts of @xmath0 and @xmath17 decays and will also use these to search for  np .",
    "a flavor factory can measure weak mixing phases , which is a phase that enters a @xmath9-@xmath10 `` oscillation '' amplitude . in the sm",
    "such amplitudes consist of @xmath18 loop diagrams and thus are especially sensitive to np .",
    "the original goal of belle and babar was to measure the phase @xmath19 , whose size is mainly determined by the mixing phase @xmath20 ) .",
    "the method is as follows : a @xmath9 oscillates to a @xmath10 and subsequently decays to a self - conjugate final state that a @xmath9 can decay to directly .",
    "this amplitude ( due to mixing ) , as compared to the direct amplitude , contains an additional weak phase ( that of mixing ) .",
    "the two amplitudes interfere , and the interference term in the decay rate is proportional to the sine of twice the overall weak phase .",
    "thus , measuring the decay time dependence allows one to fit for the interference term and determine this weak phase .    applying the method to high - statistics  and other @xmath21 decay channels",
    "measures the phase @xmath22 ; the result is @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "this method has been extended to @xmath24 and @xmath25 penguin decay modes , which should have the same overall weak phase  ( @xmath22 ) up to small corrections of @xmath26 .",
    "the results are tabulated in fig .",
    "[ fig : weakphase1 ] ; also shown for comparison is the world average value measured from @xmath21 decays .",
    "the table shows a systematic shift for @xmath27 to lower values , although the current statistical errors preclude drawing a firm conclusion . however , most theoretical predictions prefer a shift to _ higher _ values ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : weakphase2 ] ) ; this difference could be a sign of a new non - sm phase .",
    "a future flavor factory should clarify this , as the expected statistical improvement in measuring @xmath16 from @xmath27 decays is a factor of  510 .",
    "measured using various decay modes ( left ) , from the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 value is dominated by  decays . ]",
    "a flavor factory can also search for new physics ( np ) in _ decay _ phases , i.e. , phases that appear directly in a @xmath28 decay amplitude ( no @xmath9-@xmath10 mixing is needed ) .",
    "decay phases give rise to direct  violation , i.e. , a difference between @xmath29 and @xmath30 due to interference between two or more decay amplitudes ( e.g. , penguin and tree ) with different weak phases .",
    "explicitly , if @xmath31 proceeds via a tree amplitude @xmath32 and a penguin amplitude @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are weak and strong phases , respectively , then @xmath36 proceeds via @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "summing the amplitudes and squaring gives decay rates @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "taking the sums and differences of the decay rates gives @xmath42 thus a direct  asymmetry arises only if the two contributing decay amplitudes have different weak ( @xmath34 ) and strong ( @xmath35 ) phases .",
    "the charmless decays @xmath43 proceed via both tree and penguin amplitudes and , because the final states are self - tagging , are well - suited for measuring @xmath44 .",
    "the two amplitudes for the neutral decay @xmath45 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : kpi]a and [ fig : kpi]b ; the measured  asymmetry is @xmath46  @xcite . the analogous diagrams for the charged decay @xmath47 are shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : kpi]c and [ fig : kpi]d ; as these have the same weak and strong phases as those for @xmath9 decay , @xmath44 should be the same .",
    "however , the result for @xmath48 is @xmath49 away : @xmath50  @xcite",
    ". this discrepancy may indicate the presence of a new phase entering one of the decay amplitudes , e.g. , in an np - enhanced electroweak penguin  @xcite .",
    "a future flavor factory can clarify this .",
    "a flavor factory in fact has similar sensitivity to a charged higgs boson as does the lhc , but in complementary search channels .",
    "a charged higgs would manifest itself in inclusive @xmath51 decays , and in exclusive @xmath52 and @xmath53 decays .",
    "although these final states are challenging to reconstruct due to missing particles , both belle and babar have reconstructed first samples  @xcite and a flavor factory would increase these substantially .    for inclusive",
    "@xmath51 decays , one requires the presence of a high momentum photon and a charged kaon .",
    "the charged - higgs - mediated diagram for this decay is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams]a . various measurements are tabulated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsgamma_data ] ; the world average ( wa ) branching fraction is @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "an upper limit on the branching fraction sets a lower limit on @xmath55 ; this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsgamma_theory ] , which plots the limit as a function of the branching fraction central value and error .",
    "the plot corresponds to all values of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values for the two higgs fields and is an unknown model parameter . from the figure one reads that the current wa branching fraction corresponds to a 95% c.l .",
    "lower bound @xmath58 . at a future flavor factory , this bound may increase to more then 500 , depending on the branching fraction central value .    .",
    "]    a charged higgs also affects @xmath52 decays ; the relevant diagram is shown in fig .  [ fig : diagrams]b .",
    "the analysis is challenging because the signal side has two missing neutrinos and thus can not be fully reconstructed .",
    "the belle result is @xmath59  @xcite ; dividing by the sm prediction @xmath60  @xcite yields @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , in a two - higgs doublet model @xmath62  @xcite ; an upper limit on @xmath63 thus gives a lower limit on @xmath55 that depends on @xmath56 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgs_vs_tanb]a , where the shaded region is excluded . the allowed region ( light band ) in the middle of the shaded region results from a dip in @xmath63 near @xmath64 .",
    "this `` gap '' will be closed by measurements at a flavor factory of @xmath65 decays .",
    "the amplitude for this is governed by the @xmath66 transition shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams]c .",
    "the expected sensitivity of a flavor factory for 5  ab@xmath67 and 50  ab@xmath67 of data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgs_vs_tanb]b ; for large @xmath56 , most of the @xmath55 range accessible to the lhc is covered  @xcite .",
    "finally , we show that a flavor factory has suprisingly good sensitivity to supersymmetry . if the lhc observes signs of supersymmetry , measurements from a flavor factory could prove crucial for distinguishing among various theoretical models and determining the mechanism by which supersymmetry is broken .",
    "supersymmetric theories are challenging to experimentally confirm or exclude as there are many parameters to tune .",
    "for example , one way of calculating flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes in mssm is to parameterize squark mass matrices with flavor - off - diagonal mass insertion terms .",
    "the corresponding sparticles can mediate sm - suppressed fcnc transitions such as @xmath15 .",
    "thus , measuring @xmath15 observables such as @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 can nominally constrain such mass - insertion terms .",
    "these observables should be well - measured at a future flavor factory .",
    "the expected constraints as a function of gluino mass are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : supersymmetry1 ] .",
    "these plots correspond to 50  ab@xmath67 of data , and the measurement of @xmath72 from hadron collider experiments cdf and d0 has been included .",
    "the shaded areas show the regions of parameter space that would be measured non - zero with at least @xmath73 statistical significance .",
    "these shaded regions cover about half the parameter space . for the restricted case of a light gluino ( @xmath74 )",
    ", all values of mass insertions are covered .",
    "a flavor factory can discriminate among different susy - breaking mechanisms via the observables @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the results of a monte carlo calculation of @xmath77 and @xmath76 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : supersymmetry2 ] and [ fig : supersymmetry3 ] , respectively , for three models of susy - breaking : msugra , su(5 ) susy gut , and mssm+u(2 ) . for each case",

    "is the error bar expected from measurements at a flavor factory for 50  ab@xmath67 of data .",
    "one sees that , depending on the central values obtained , a flavor factory could distinguish among the models .",
    "for example , a central value of @xmath78 would essentially rule out msugra , and a large value @xmath79 would favor su(5 ) susy gut with a small gluino mass .",
    "( see text ) for three supersymmetric theories : msugra ( left ) , su(5 ) susy gut ( middle ) , and mssm+u(2 ) ( right ) .",
    "the data point shown illustrates the error expected from 50  ab@xmath67 of data  @xcite . ]     for three supersymmetric theories : msugra ( left ) , su(5 ) susy gut ( middle ) , and mssm+u(2 ) ( right ) .",
    "the data point shown illustrates the error expected from 50  ab@xmath67 of data  @xcite . ]",
    "a flavor factory running in the era of the lhc would make very large perhaps decisive contributions to our understanding of beyond - the - sm physics .",
    "such a facility would rigorously test our understanding of the sm ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : weakphase1 ] and [ fig : weakphase2 ] ) , constrain the mass of a charged higgs ( figs .",
    "[ fig : bsgamma_theory ] and [ fig : higgs_vs_tanb ] ) , measure the values of supersymmetric mass insertion terms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : supersymmetry1 ] ) , and possibly distinguish among different scenarios of supersymmetry breaking ( figs .  [",
    "fig : supersymmetry2 ] and [ fig : supersymmetry3 ] ) .",
    "if supersymmetry is discovered at the lhc , a flavor factory may be necessary to determine how it is broken .",
    "in addition , a flavor factory can study @xmath80-@xmath81 mixing and search for  violation in this system ; a signal for the latter at the percent level would be a strong indication of np .",
    "the clean environment of an @xmath82 flavor factory allows one to search for np in forbidden @xmath83 decays such as @xmath84 .",
    "a future flavor factory is needed to solve the flavor puzzles uncovered by the @xmath1-factory experiments belle and babar , e.g. , @xmath16 measured in @xmath27 loop processes is systematically lower than that measured in @xmath21 tree processes ; and @xmath44 measured in charged @xmath85 decays differs substantially from that measured in neutral @xmath86 decays .",
    "these measurements are complementary to those that will be made at lhc experiments , which are based on higher-@xmath87 triggers operating in high - multiplicity hadroproduction environments .",
    "measurements made at a flavor factory may greatly increase our understanding of results from the lhc .",
