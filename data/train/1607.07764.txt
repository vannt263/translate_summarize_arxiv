    "an appealing physical idea of the weak measurement tomography johansen , lundeen1,lundeen2,elefante , salvail offers a possibility of reconstruction of the wave function in a single experimental setup that involves a specific system - pointer coupling ; the so - called direct state tomography ( dst ) . basically , the scheme consists in successive measurements of two complementary observables of the system , where only the first one is weakly coupled to the measurement apparatus lundeen1,lundeen2,elefante , salvail .",
    "recently , this procedure was generalized to arbitrary coupling strengths @xcite , and it was argued that the strong measurements expectably outperform the weak ones both in precision and accuracy .    since in the framework of weak measurements",
    "the efficiency is traded for accuracy , the error estimation analysis becomes vital .",
    "typically , the experimental performance of dst in the case of weak measurements , is compared either with results of strong ( projective ) tomography @xcite .",
    "an alternative method of estimation of the fidelity of a reconstructed state was introduced in @xcite . however , non of the above - mentioned approaches analyzed the global intrinsic error estimation helstrom , englert , checos .    in this letter",
    "we show that conveniently reformulating the approach vallone as a mutually unbiased bases ( mub)-like reconstruction scheme in non - orthogonal bases @xcite one can carry out the mean square error ( mse ) analysis of dst , including the weak measurement limit , in the framework of measurement statistics @xcite .",
    "in particular , we exemplify on the single qubit case that non - orthogonal bases appear as effective projective states , in such a way that a weak coupling corresponds to projection into near - parallel bases .",
    "this allows us to reformulate the accuracy analysis in terms of measured probabilities . and",
    "thus , estimate the intrinsic statistical errors finding the minimum mse using the crmer - rao lower bound .",
    "following the general idea of dst we consider an unknown state @xmath0 of the system ( one qubit ) interacting with a pointer ( another qubit ) initially prepared in the eigenstate state @xmath1 of the pauli operator @xmath2 , according to @xmath3where @xmath4 $ ] is the measurement strength .",
    "after the interaction the system is postselected in the state @xmath5 , and the pointer is measured in the bases @xmath6 : @xmath7and the following probabilities are retrieved @xmath8where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the normalization constants . in the framework of dst @xcite ,",
    "@xcite the wave function is reconstructed in the basis @xmath11 of eigenstates of @xmath12 as a linear combination of the probabilities @xmath13 . on the other hand , the probabilities ( [ pik ] ) can be considered as projections of the initial state @xmath14 into the set    @xmath15    so that @xmath16it is worth noticing that similar effective projection states naturally appear in experiments @xcite .    explicitly , the effective projection states ( [ psiik ] ) have the form @xmath17where @xmath18 , and satisfy the condition @xmath19defining the so - called equidistant bases @xcite .",
    "introducing @xmath20 we rewrite elements @xmath21 as follows @xmath22for @xmath23 so that @xmath24 and the limit @xmath25 of almost parallel  states ( close to @xmath26 ) corresponds to the weak measurement case , @xmath27",
    ".    an important feature of the probabilities @xmath13 , @xmath23 is the relation @xcite @xmath28which reflects a statistical dependence on the measurements in the non - orthogonal and computational bases .",
    "the bases ( [ bases ] ) form an informationally complete set for @xmath29 ) according to @xcite @xmath30where @xmath31 , is the corresponding @xmath32-th biorthogonal basis , @xmath33 . in the limit @xmath34 ( @xmath35 )",
    "the expression above is converted to the standard ( orthogonal ) mub tomographic expression @xcite allowing the maximum information gain @xcite .",
    "each projector in the set @xmath36 can be considered as a single output channel of an effective measuring apparatus .",
    "an estimation procedure consists in a repetitive measurement on each of @xmath37 identical copies of the system , i.e. the pointer is postselected in every basis the same number of times , obtaining frequencies @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of projections into @xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding statistics of outcomes is binomial - like @xcite @xmath41where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the condition ( [ s ] ) is satisfied . for the computational basis , where @xmath45 , the statistics is obviously binomial .",
    "the expectation values corresponding to the probability distribution ( binomial ) are of the form @xmath46 .",
    "\\label{expectation}\\ ] ]    following general ideas @xcite , we compute the estimation error as the average squared of the hilbert - schmidt distance between the true @xmath0 and estimated @xmath47 system states , @xmath48\\rangle . \\label{e}\\ ] ] it depends on @xmath49 and the inner product between all the projectors appearing in ( [ reconstruccion ] ) .",
    "taking into account ( [ s ] ) we obtain for the difference between true ( @xmath13 ) and estimated ( @xmath50 ) probabilities , @xmath51 , the following relations @xmath52substituting the above relations into ( [ e ] ) and averaging for many repetitions , we obtain for the average quadratic error @xmath53where the  explicit form of the coefficients @xmath54 ( in matrix form ) is given in appendix . employing the cramr - rao lower bound we minimize the possible mean square error ( mse ) per trail @xcite @xmath55where @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 is the fisher matrix per trail , @xmath58being @xmath59 the likelihood . after straightforward but lengthy calculations ( see appendix ) we find that the lower bound for the estimation error per trial in terms of measured probabilities is given by @xmath60 .",
    "\\label{error2}\\end{aligned}\\]]it is easy to see that at @xmath34 ( corresponding to @xmath35 ) the mean hilbert - schmidt distance for mubs is recovered @xcite .",
    "the lower bound ( [ error2 ] ) can still be averaged over the space of quantum states .",
    "we will consider pure and mixed states separately .",
    "let us first consider an arbitrary pure state @xmath61 with projections @xmath62 and @xmath63 on the basis @xmath64 , that can be taken as @xmath65 due to invariance of the averaging procedure under unitary transformations .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath66thus , the averaged , over the space of pure states , mse takes the form @xmath67where the double brackets mean averaging both over the sample and over the space of states . for @xmath34 , corresponding to the standard mub tomography , @xmath68 checos , while in the limit @xmath69 the lower bound of the mse diverges as @xmath70 , which qualitatively coincides with results of @xcite .    in order to average over mixed states we use the eigenvalue distribution based on the bures metric @xcite , @xmath71making use of the spectral decomposition @xmath72 , where the eigenstates can be parametrized as @xmath73with @xmath74 $ ] , and @xmath75 $ ] we perform integration of ( [ error2 ] ) with the measure @xmath76 .",
    "the result of such integration can be found analytically in terms of special functions and studied in the limit cases . due to its cumbersome form",
    "we do not present the explicit expression , but instead plot it in fig .",
    "[ error1qb ] .     over a sample of @xmath77 random statesas a fucntion of @xmath78 : ( red ) dashed line for pure states , ( blue ) continuous line for mixed states .",
    "average error for sic - povm does not depend on @xmath79 and is represented as a constant ( red ) dashed line @xmath80 for pure states and ( blue ) continuous line @xmath81 for random mixed states . the vertical line at @xmath82 shows the bound where the @xmath83.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ error1qb ] we plot @xmath84 , where the average is taken for a sample of @xmath77 pure and mixed random states following the routine introduced in @xcite . for pure states",
    ", the plot of the square root of equation ( [ erroran ] ) perfectly coincides with the numerical results .",
    "the mixed states are produced according to the bures metric .",
    "as it is expected , the best estimation is obtained for mub tomography , with @xmath85 for pure states , and @xmath86 for mixed states .",
    "one can also clearly see that the stronger the measurements are , the smaller the estimation errors are .",
    "the performance of dst can be also compared with a tomographic scheme based on symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measure ( sic - pomv ) measurements @xcite . for a single qubit",
    "a set of projectors @xmath87 such that @xmath88 and @xmath89 span the density matrix@xmath90where the probabilities @xmath91 are the outcomes associated with measurement of the operator @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "the corresponding mse lower bound has the form ( [ mse ] ) , where the components of the matrix @xmath94 are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and the fisher matrix elements per trail are @xmath97 which leads to @xmath98 for pure states @xcite . in fig.[error1qb ] we plot @xmath99 for sic - povm tomography as ( red ) dashed constant line  for pure states and as a ( blue ) continuous constant line for mixed states , produced according to the bures metric , obtaining in this case @xmath100   by averaging over @xmath77 randomly generated states .",
    "one can observe that dst outperforms sic - povm qubit tomography for @xmath101 , which is indicated in fig .",
    "[ error1qb ] as a vertical ( magenta ) dotted - dashed line .",
    "we have shown that the performance of the dst protocol can be analyzed in a similar way as in the standard projection - based reconstruction schemes . in the framework of our approach",
    "we have been able to determine the estimation error for any measurement strength , including the weak measurement case . in addition , an explicit analytic form for the minimum square error have been found in the pure and mixed states .",
    "the proposed scheme can be extended to higher dimensions and composite many - particle systems .",
    "in this appendix we briefly deduce eq .",
    "( [ error2 ] ) . taking into account the overlaps @xcite @xmath102 , @xmath103 into ( [ e ] ) and ( reconstruccion ) one arrives to @xmath104    the fisher matrix ( per trial ) ( [ fisher ] )",

    "the main difference with the mub case consists in appearing elements in @xmath57 outside of the main diagonal , which is a consequence of the relation ( [ s ] ) : @xmath109for the non - orthogonal bases @xmath110 , the elements are similar to the mub case , normalized by the factor @xmath111 : @xmath112substituting the explicit forms of @xmath94 and @xmath57 into ( [ mse ] ) one obtains ( [ error2 ] ) .",
