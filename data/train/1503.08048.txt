    "vaccination is the most effective response to large - scale epidemic outbreaks , such as seasonal influenza and influenza like epidemics .",
    "vaccination both limits the extent of the outbreak and reduces morbidity and mortality  @xcite .",
    "however , electing to take vaccination brings certain side effects or inconveniences ; while protecting not only those who are vaccinated but also their neighbors , and leading to the so - called effect of `` herd - immunity '' .",
    "this scenario naturally leads to the problem of `` free - riding '' commonly observed in public goods studies  @xcite .",
    "recently , by incorporating evolutionary game theory into traditional epidemiological models , many researchers have demonstrated that a voluntary vaccination policy without incentives may be unable to eradicate a vaccine - preventable disease  @xcite .",
    "one possible way of solving the social dilemma with respect to vaccination is for the government or health organizations to offer some incentive programs , e.g. , subsidy and insurance policies  @xcite .    since many diseases spread through human populations by physical contact between infected individuals and susceptible individuals , the pattern of these disease - causing contact forms a network . in the past decades ,",
    "network - based epidemiological models have attracted myriad attention and many significant results have been achieved  @xcite . to control the epidemic spreading on complex networks ,",
    "many well - studied immunization strategies have been proposed , such as targeted immunization  @xcite and acquaintance immunization  @xcite . compared to a random immunization strategy",
    ", these two immunization strategies have been proven to be more efficient in controlling the spread of epidemic diseases on complex networks . however , the results were obtained by the two implicit assumptions : 1 ) there are enough public resources to vaccinate many individuals ; 2 ) the behavioral responses of the remaining individuals are not considered . in reality ,",
    "public resource limitations mean that government agencies can usually only freely vaccinate a small proportion of people .",
    "the remaining population decide whether or not to take vaccination according to a voluntary principle  and subject to an associated vaccination cost .",
    "in this case , the vaccination decision of the remaining people is dependent on the risk of infection , prevalence of infection , the cost of vaccination , public opinion and so on  @xcite .",
    "in particular , their vaccination decisions are sensitively influenced by the proportion of subsidized individuals as well as which kinds of individuals are subsidized .",
    "for example , if some hub nodes are freely immunized , the nodes with small degrees have small probability of being infected due to the herd immunity effect from these hub nodes , as a result , many nodes are unwilling to take vaccination , leading to an increase in the final epidemic size . therefore",
    ", we need to reconsider whether the classical targeted subsidy policy ( i.e. , targeted immunization under which certain individuals with the highest degree are freely immunized ) is still better than the random case  @xcite .    in this paper , a vaccination decision model with a preferential selection mechanism based on game theory is established to investigate the interplay of the subsidy policy , the voluntary vaccination decision and the spreading dynamics on networks .",
    "we then compare the effects of the targeted subsidy policy with the random policy on the vaccination and epidemic dynamics .",
    "we find that the preferential selection mechanism plays a vital role on whether the targeted subsidy policy yields ideal results .",
    "we show that the advantage of the targeted policy is greatly increased when the non - subsidized individuals prefer to select the subsidized individuals as imitation objects .",
    "however , the control effect of the targeted policy is even worse than that of the random policy when non - subsidized individuals randomly or preferentially select other non - subsidized nodes as their imitation objects .",
    "more importantly , we find that , for the targeted policy , increasing the subsidy proportion may increase _ rather than _ reduce the final epidemic size when non - subsidized individuals are preferentially selected , it is because that a small subsidy proportion may greatly reduce the vaccination willingness of the non - subsidized individuals .",
    "in addition , by defining the social cost as the sum of the costs of vaccination and infection , we find that the social cost non - monotonically depends on the subsidized proportion @xmath0 for both subsidy policies .",
    "our findings indicate that the effects of well - designed subsidy policies may be undermined or counter - productive if the policies are implemented without considering the intricate human behavioral responses , such as neglecting the non - subsidized individuals responses on the subsidy policies .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe our model of epidemic spreading on complex networks by integrating game theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we present our main results concerning the effects of the two subsidy policies on the vaccination coverage , the final epidemic size and the social cost . meanwhile , an example of influenza case is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : apendix ] to demonstrate the applicability of these results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we present conclusion and discussions .",
    "taking into account seasonal flu - like diseases and the limited effectiveness of vaccines and following previous studies  @xcite , we model the vaccination dynamics and the epidemic as a two - stage process : the first stage is the vaccination decision stage , which is implemented before each epidemic season ; the second stage is the epidemic season stage , where non - vaccinated individuals may be infected by diseases described by the standard susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model .",
    "specifically , at the vaccination stage , except for a proportion @xmath0 of individuals who are freely vaccinated ( according to either the targeted strategy or the random strategy ) , each individual needs to decide whether or not to take vaccination .",
    "choosing to take vaccination will incur a cost @xmath1 [ the cost of vaccination can account for the monetary cost of the vaccine , the perceived vaccine risks , side effects , long - term healthy impacts , and so forth ] regardless of the non - subsidized or subsidized individuals ( the vaccination cost of the subsidized individuals is @xmath1 though they need not pay the cost themselves ) .",
    "we also assume that the vaccine can perfectly protect vaccinated individuals from infection in the following epidemic season .",
    "the second stage is the epidemic season stage , during which each unvaccinated individual has a probability of being infected during the season . in this stage",
    "the epidemic strain infects an initial number @xmath2 of individuals , and the disease spreads according to sir dynamics with daily transmission rate @xmath3 and recovery rate @xmath4 .",
    "the epidemic continues until there are no more newly infected individuals .",
    "an individual who gets infected during the epidemic season pays a cost @xmath5 . without loss of generality",
    ", we set @xmath6 and let @xmath7 describe the relative cost of vaccination , whose value is restricted in the region of @xmath8 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "those individuals who are neither vaccinated nor infected pay no cost , so they are the free riders .",
    "let @xmath9 be the current payoff of individual @xmath10 at season @xmath11 . according to the above descriptions",
    ", @xmath10 takes one of the three cost values as follows    p_i(t)=[1 ] -c ,   ; + -1 ,  ; + 0 ,  .    after the last epidemic season , individuals can update their strategies again in the following vaccination decision stage based on their previous experiences . considering",
    "that imitation phenomena commonly exist in the real world  @xcite , many studies have investigated the impact of an imitation rule from the game theoretical perspective as well as in the vaccination decision - making epidemiological models  @xcite . hence , we also assume individuals update their strategies based on an imitation rule",
    ". specifically , if an individual @xmath10 updates her vaccination strategy , she _",
    "randomly _ chooses an immediate neighbor @xmath12 with which to compare their expected payoff , and then adopts @xmath12 s strategy with a probability dependent on their payoff difference  @xcite : @xmath13},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes the vaccination choice for individual @xmath10 : either vaccinated or not , where @xmath15 describes the rationality of the individuals .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we let @xmath16 in this paper , implying that better - performing individuals are readily imitated , but it is still possible to adopt the behavior of an individual performing worse .    when the subsidy policies from the governments or health organizations are included , it is difficult to be definitive over whether individuals choose to imitate subsidized or non - subsidized individuals .",
    "for example , some individuals may prefer to imitate the subsidized individuals strategies since these subsidized individuals are chosen by authoritative organizations .",
    "conversely , some individuals are willing to imitate non - subsidized individuals strategies since their strategies come from their self - choices but not from the external environments . in view of this , we introduce a selection parameter @xmath17 to differentiate the preferential selection rule . in detail , we first give a different weight value @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) for non - subsidized ( subsidized ) individuals , then the probability of node @xmath10 choosing neighbor @xmath12 is given as :    @xmath20    here @xmath21 denotes the neighborhood of node @xmath10 and @xmath22 is the weight of node @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath23 , non - subsidized neighbors are more likely to be selected as the potential strategy objects . on the contrary , for @xmath24 , individuals tend to select subsidized neighbors as potential imitation objects .",
    "neighbors are randomly selected as @xmath25 , which returns to the original model .",
    "our main aim is to explore how the value of @xmath17 affects the vaccination coverage , the final epidemic size and the social cost in regard with the two different subsidy policies .",
    "in our simulations , for targeted subsidy policy , a proportion @xmath0 of individuals with the highest degrees are freely vaccinated , for the random subsidy policy , a proportion @xmath0 of individuals of individuals is randomly selected and freely vaccinated",
    ". then equal fractions of vaccinated and non - vaccinated individuals are randomly distributed among a proportion @xmath26 of individuals to start the iterative process . meanwhile ,",
    "the number of initially infected individuals in each epidemic season is @xmath27 .",
    "the long run equilibrium results are obtained by averaging the last 1000 iterations of a total of 3000 iterations in 100 independent realizations .",

    "<S> suppose that public resources are finite and that only a small proportion of individuals can be vaccinated freely ( complete subsidy ) , for the remainder of the population vaccination is a voluntary behavior  and each vaccinated individual carries a perceived cost . </S>",
    "<S> we ask whether the classical targeted subsidy strategy is definitely better than the random strategy : does targeting subsidy at individuals perceived to be with the greatest risk actually help ? with these questions , we propose a model to investigate the _ interaction effects _ of the subsidy policies and individuals responses when facing subsidy policies on the epidemic dynamics on complex networks . in the model , a small proportion of individuals are freely vaccinated according to either the targeted or random subsidy policy , the remainder choose to vaccinate ( or not ) based on voluntary principle and update their vaccination decision via an imitation rule . </S>",
    "<S> our findings show that the targeted strategy is only advantageous when individuals prefer to imitate the subsidized individuals strategy . otherwise , the effect of the targeted policy is worse than the random immunization , since individuals preferentially select non - subsidized individuals as the imitation objects . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we find that under the targeted subsidy policy , increasing the proportion of subsidized individuals may increase the final epidemic size . </S>",
    "<S> we further define social cost as the sum of the costs of vaccination and infection , and study how each of the two policies affect the social cost . </S>",
    "<S> our result shows that there exist some optimal intermediate regions leading to the minimal social cost . </S>"
