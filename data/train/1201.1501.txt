    "in the lhc era there is hope to discover or rule out the existence of a light higgs boson responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry in the standard model of particle physics . recently ,",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations have discussed possible evidences of a higgs boson with mass around 125 gev  @xcite . if these results are confirmed one should understand the possibility to predict the properties of the higgs in different theories in order to explain the experimental results .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most appealing ideas for physics beyond the standard model which provides the possibility to understand why the higgs boson is light . in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "the higgs mass is predicted at tree level , @xmath0 , but at one - loop level the prediction depends mainly on the masses and couplings between the higgs and the third generation of fermions and sfermions . for excellent reviews on higgs phenomenology in susy",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that in order to satisfy the lep2 bound , @xmath1 gev  @xcite , the masses of the stops have to be large and/or one must assume a very large left - right mixing in the stop sector . the situation is worse if one thinks about the possibility to obtain a higgs mass around 125 gev , as it has been discussed by the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if one hopes to discover susy it is important to understand the scenarios where we can satisfy the collider bounds on the higgs mass without assuming a very heavy supersymmetric spectrum .",
    "the new results from atlas and cms have motivated several studies in the context of low - energy supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "in this letter we investigate the possible predictions for the light cp - even higgs mass and the constraints coming from the atlas and cms results in the context of a simple extension of the mssm , where the baryon and lepton numbers are local gauge symmetries spontaneously broken at the tev scale .",
    "we refer to this theory as the  blmssm \"  @xcite . in this theoretical framework",
    "we can understand the absence of the dangerous dimension four and five baryon number violating operators  @xcite present in the mssm .",
    "one uses a fourth generation that is vector - like with respect to the strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions to cancel anomalies and there is no need for large yukawa couplings to be consistent with the experimental limits on fourth generation quark masses .",
    "therefore , the model is free of coupling constants with landau poles near the weak scale .",
    "furthermore , there is a natural suppression of flavour violation in the quark and leptonic sectors since the gauge symmetries and particle content forbid tree level flavor changing neutral currents involving the quarks or charged leptons .",
    "we find that the existence of new charged and neutral leptons provides the possibility to satisfy the lep2 bound and achieve a higgs mass around 125 gev without assuming a very heavy spectrum for the supersymmetric particles even in the case where the left - right mixing in the stop sector is very small . in this case one",
    "has new one - loop leptonic contributions for the higgs mass which allows to increase the mass with light stops and we find an upper bound on the ratio between the vacuum expectation values of the mssm higgses .",
    "we discuss the possible implications of these results for the experimental test of supersymmetry and the unique leptonic signals at the lhc .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : in the first section we discuss the main features of the blmssm , while in the second section we investigate the predictions for the higgs mass and the impact of the new one - loop corrections .",
    "finally , we summarize the new results .",
    "recently , we have proposed a simple supersymmetric model where the baryon number ( b ) and lepton number ( l ) are local gauge symmetries  @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the gauge symmetry @xmath2 we refer to this model as the  blmssm \" . in this context b and l are spontaneously broken gauge symmetries at the tev scale and one can understand the absence of baryon and lepton number violating operators of dimension four and five present in the mssm .",
    "in this model we have the chiral superfields of the mssm , and in order to cancel the b and l anomalies we need a vector - like family : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "see table i for the superfields present in the blmssm .",
    "it is important to emphasize that one does not need large yukawa couplings to be consistent with the experimental limits on fourth generation quark masses and hence the models are free of coupling constants with landau poles near the weak scale .",
    "the baryonic and leptonic anomalies can be cancelled if one imposes the conditions  @xcite : @xmath15 in the quark sector and @xmath16 in the leptonic sector . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for baryon and lepton number for a given field , respectively .",
    ".superfields in the blmssm . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ default ]    the full superpotential of the model is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mssm superpotential and @xmath21 is the needed superpotential to give masses to the new quarks in the theory .",
    "notice that we have neglected the interactions of the new quarks with the mssm higgses since their contributions to the quark masses is not very relevant . in general the yukawa couplings between the new quarks and the mssm higgses",
    "can be large and modify the higgs mass at one - loop level .",
    "notice that these couplings can have a large impact on the production cross section , @xmath22 , and it is can be difficult to satisfy the experimental bounds . in this letter",
    ", we will stick to the most conservative scenario where these quark yukawa couplings are small and the higgs mass can be modified only by the yukawa couplings of the new leptons which have to be large in order to satisfy the collider bounds .",
    "the mssm higgs superfields are denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , while the new higgs chiral superfields , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , generate mass for the new leptophobic gauge boson , @xmath27 , and for the new heavy quarks . in the leptonic sector one",
    "has the following interactions @xmath28 here , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are chiral superfields which vacuum expectation values spontaneously break lepton number and give mass to the quark - phobic gauge boson @xmath31 . notice that we have an implementation of the seesaw mechanism for the light neutrino masses , while the new fourth generation neutrinos have dirac mass terms .",
    "the mass for the new leptons are given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 using the above equations and imposing the perturbative condition for the yukawa coupling , @xmath34 , one finds an upper bound on @xmath35 : @xmath36 when @xmath37 gev .",
    "this bound on @xmath35 will be crucial to understand the numerical results for the higgs mass in the next section because the upper bound on @xmath35 gives us the largest contribution to the higgs mass at tree level .    in order to complete our discussion",
    "we list the new superpotential in the higgs sector : @xmath38 now , we could ask the following question : what is the role of the new fermions beyond the anomaly cancellation ? if one takes a look at eq.([wlept ] ) we can realize that the new charged and neutral leptons can modify the predictions for the higgs masses at one - loop level .",
    "as we will show in the next section , their contributions are crucial to have light stops and sbottoms in the supersymmetric spectrum .    : as we have mentioned the symmetries @xmath39 and @xmath40 are broken at the tev scale since the masses of the new neutral gauge bosons are related to the susy breaking mass scale . in order to show this we give the dependence of the new gauge boson masses on the parameters in the model : @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are soft masses for the higgses @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "note that without the soft susy breaking mass terms one does not get a positive value of @xmath49 which implies that the lepton ( baryon ) number symmetry breaking scale is of order the susy breaking scale .",
    "it is important to mention that in order to break @xmath40 one does not need to introduce the superfields @xmath50 and @xmath51 since one could assume that the right - handed sneutrinos can get a vev . for the realization of this idea see for example  @xcite .",
    "the only problem here is that one could have fast contributions to proton decay  @xcite if the cutoff of the theory is not very large . using the equation below ,",
    "eq.(14 ) , and the lepton number violating interactions one gets contributions to nucleon decay .",
    "this scenario will be investigated in a future publication .    : for any values of the baryonic charges of the new fermions which satisfy the anomaly conditions the higgses @xmath52 and @xmath53 have charges @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "then , one can write the following dimension five operator which gives rise to baryon number violation @xmath56 after @xmath39 breaking at the tev scale one has the @xmath57 mssm interactions , @xmath58 , which violate baryon number . as it is well - known",
    ", these interactions render the lightest neutralino unstable .",
    "for example , the photino can decay to a quark and a virtual anti squark that then decays into two quarks .",
    "of course if @xmath59 is too small and/or @xmath60 is too large this decay will be not occur inside an lhc detector .",
    "these interactions can change the current lhc bounds on the supersymmetric particles since all constraints on channels with missing energy can be avoided .",
    "one interesting scenario is the case where the stop is the lsp and can decay into two jets .",
    "it is important to mention that there is no mixing between the sm fermions and the new fermions from renormalizable operators in the model .",
    "however , at the dimension five level we could write the following interactions which allow the lightest new quark to decay @xmath61 these interactions require @xmath62 . in this case",
    "the new quarks can decay and we can avoid a possible issue with big bang nucleosyntesis .",
    "in order to set our notation we define the neutral higgses as @xmath63 and @xmath64 using this notation and working in the basis @xmath65 the mass matrix for the mssm neutral cp - even higgs is given by @xmath66 with @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the pseudo - scalar higgs mass and @xmath69 . in the simplest case when we neglect the left - right mixing in the sfermion sectors , @xmath70 ,",
    "the one - loop radiative corrections read as @xmath71 and @xmath72 in our notation @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the mass for the sbottoms and stops , respectively .",
    "we use the same notation for the sfermions in the charged lepton sector . notice the presence of the last terms in the above equations due to new yukawa couplings between the mssm higgses and new charged and neutral leptons .",
    "in the above matrix we have neglected the contributions proportional to the left - right mixings in the top and bottom sectors in order to illustrate the impact of the new contributions . for more general expressions",
    "see for example  @xcite . in our numerical results",
    "we will take into account the left - right mixing and we use the most general expressions at one - loop level .    in order to set our notation",
    "we define the mass matrix for the sfermions as @xmath75 where @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the isospin , @xmath78 are the trilinear soft terms , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the soft masses and the mass for the physical states are given by @xmath81 notice that the contributions from the @xmath39 and @xmath40 d - terms to the sfermion masses can be absorbed in the soft masses . here",
    "we stick to this possibility for simplicity .",
    "now , it is easy to realize that the existence of new leptons in the theory will help to increase the mass for the light higgs in the model and allows for a light stop and sbottom in the spectrum .",
    "we have investigated this issue in detail and show our main results .    *",
    "minimal mixing scenario : @xmath70 + in fig.1 we show the predictions for the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs for different values of @xmath35 assuming a simple scenario where all soft sfermion masses are taken equal to 500 gev and we have neglected the left - right mixings in the stop , sbottom and heavy new slepton sectors . in blue",
    "we show the results in the context of the mssm , while the line in black shows the predictions in the blmssm . one can appreciate that it is possible to increase the mass of the higgs in more than 10 gev in the majority fraction of the parameter space .",
    "therefore , we can say that it is possible to satisfy easily the lep2 bound , @xmath1 gev , and achieve a mass around 125 gev due to the extra contributions .",
    "there results are relevant if one thinks about the possibility to discover a light susy spectrum where all squarks of the third generation are light enough to be discovered at the lhc and the possibility to explain the existence of a light higgs boson without having a lot of fine - tuning .",
    "+ in order to understand the possibility to have a higgs mass around 125 gev in this model , we show in fig.2 the allowed values for the masses of the new leptons using the same input parameters as in fig.1 . here",

    "3 . one can appreciate that the higgs mass can be as large as 127 gev and one can have several solutions where the higgs mass is the range @xmath87 gev .",

    "the higgs mass can be much larger in the region where @xmath35 changes between 2 and 7 .",
    "the upper bound on the higgs mass in this case is around 140 gev without assuming very heavy squarks .",
    "these results tell us that due to the existence of the new light charged and neutral leptons , which are needed to cancel the leptonic anomalies , the higgs mass can be much larger than in the mssm and one can satisfy the experimental bounds without assuming very heavy stops and sbottoms .",

    "the bounds on the heavy lepton mass are basically , @xmath103 gev , see for example  @xcite . in our case the bounds should be different because the heavy dirac neutrinos are stable and the charged leptons do not decay into the sm leptons .",
    "as we have mentioned , the new dirac neutrinos are stable since the extra generation of leptons never mix with the sm leptons .",
    "therefore , one expects different channels with missing energy .",
    "here we list three different channels :    * four jets and missing energy : the charged leptons , @xmath104 , can be produced in pair through the photon , the @xmath105 or the higgs boson .",
    "then , one can have the channels @xmath106 @xmath107 * two jets plus missing energy : one can have the associated production of a charged lepton and neutrino through the @xmath108 gauge boson @xmath109 * channels with missing energy : one can produce the heavy stable neutrinos through the @xmath105 or @xmath110 boson @xmath111 in this case one should use initial state radiation ( isr ) , a photon or a jet , in order to look for these events with missing energy .",
    "notice one can get the same signals for the leptons of the other generation .",
    "the cross sections above are much smaller than the cross section for squarks production , but one should be able to use the searches for multijets and missing energy to set bounds on the heavy lepton masses .",

    "it is not difficult to show that the branching ratio for the higgs into gamma gamma decay is not very different from the prediction in the standard model .",
    "this issue will be investigated in a future publication .",
