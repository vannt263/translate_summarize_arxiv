    "peacock , miller & longair ( 1986 ) point out that r@xmath56 can be used as a discriminating parameter only if the radio and optical luminosities are linearly correlated , which does not seem to be the case ( stocke et al .",

    "( 1996 ) definition to classify a source as radio loud .",
    "having the radio spectral indices of the two bright radio sources , j0836 + 0054 and j0913 + 5919 ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively ) , allows us to estimate their luminosity densities at a rest frame frequency of 1.4  ghz . for j0836 + 0054",
    "the value is @xmath61 w hz@xmath2 , while that for j0913 + 5919 is @xmath62   w hz@xmath2 .",
    "both these sources are radio - loud by any definition .",
    "the radio spectral indices for j0756 + 4104 and j0301 + 0020 are unknown , so we calculate luminosity densities using the spectral index of @xmath63 adopted in previous studies ( eg",
    ". stern et al .",
    "2000 , ivezic et al .",
    "the 1.4  ghz rest frame luminosities for these two sources are @xmath64 and @xmath65 w hz@xmath2 respectively , placing them below the radio - loud demarcation .",
    "three sources ( j0756 + 4104 , j0301 + 0020 and j1044 - 0125 ) are detected at ( sub)mm wavelengths at levels at least ten times above their 1.4 ghz flux densities , implying rapidly rising spectra from cm - to - mm wavelengths .",
    "note that an observing frequency of 250 ghz corresponds to a rest frequency of 1600 ghz (= 188 @xmath23 m ) for a source at @xmath66 , such that the mambo observations sample the rest frame far ir part of the spectra .",
    "benford et al . ( 1999 ) have performed multiwavelength observations of a number of mm - loud high redshift qsos , and in every case they find that the rest frame far ir seds are consistent with a gray body spectrum characteristic of thermal emission from warm dust . in the analysis below",
    "we will assume that the rapidly rising cm - to - mm spectra of the three mm - loud sources in our sample imply thermal emission from warm dust .",
    "however , we can not preclude more exotic explanations for the rapidly rising spectra , such as synchrotron self absorption at rest frame far ir wavelengths .    one possible method for addressing the question of dust heating is using the fact that star - forming galaxies at low redshift follow a very tight linear relation between radio continuum and fir luminosity ( condon & yin 1990 ; condon 1992 ; crawford , marr , partridge & strauss 1996 ; miller & owen 2001 ; yun , reddy , & condon 2001 ) .",
    "this correlation holds over four orders of magnitude in luminosity with only a factor of two scatter around linearity for galaxy samples selected in the optical , ir , and radio .",
    "while a general correlation is expected since the synchrotron radiation at centimeter wavelengths , and thermal dust emission at ir wavelengths , both relate to massive star formation , the tightness and linearity of the correlation remain puzzling .",
    "a further uncertainty in using the fir - radio correlation , to assess the significance of star - formation in heating the dust , is that lower luminosity radio quiet qsos at lower redshift also follow the standard radio  fir correlation for star forming galaxies ( sopp & alexander 1991 ) .",
    "whether the sources in the sopp & alexander sample also host active star formation remains unknown . also , there is the question of whether the radio - fir correlation holds in star forming galaxies at high redshift ( carilli & yun 1999 ; 2000 ; yun & carilli 2002 ; garrett 2001 ) . given these uncertainties",
    ", we feel that comparing centimeter and millimeter continuum luminosities is simply a consistency check for star formation , but not conclusive evidence for it .",
    "figure 3 shows the relationship between redshift and the 250-to-1.4 ghz spectral index ( @xmath67 ) for a star - forming galaxy taken from the study of carilli & yun ( 2000 ) .",
    "this model consists of the mean sed ( plus scatter ) of 17 low - redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "the far ir part of this model sed corresponds roughly to a modified blackbody spectrum with a dust temperature of 50k and emissivity index of 1.5 , and the centimeter part of the spectrum is constrained to follow the radio - to - fir correlation for star forming galaxies .",
    "a point located below the curve ( plus scatter ) on this diagram indicates a source that is radio loud relative to a star - forming galaxy .",
    "in such an object it is likely that the radio emission is due to the agn and not star formation ( yun et al .",
    "2001 ) .    for j0301 + 0020",
    "we find @xmath68 , well below the region defined by star forming galaxies . for j0756 + 4104",
    "we find @xmath69 , which is consistent ( within the errors ) with the low end of the range for star forming galaxies .",
    "for j1044 - 0125 we extrapolate to 250 ghz from the measured 350 ghz flux density ( section 3 ) .",
    "this source was not detected at 1.4 ghz , implying @xmath70 , which is at least consistent with star formation .",
    "a factor two deeper radio observations are required to test whether this source follows the radio - fir relationship defined by low redshift galaxies",
    ".      x - ray observations of the source j1306 + 0356 ( brandt et al . 2002 ) suggest a possible jet - like feature 23   from the qso position ( schwartz 2002 ) .",
    "schwartz ( 2002 ) argues that the emission may be due to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the cosmic background by relativistic electrons in a jet emanating from the qso .",
    "these same relativistic electrons would emit radio synchrotron radiation in the presence of a magnetic field , hence we have searched for radio emission from the location of the jet - like x - ray feature .",
    "we have not detected radio emission from the possible x - ray jet in j1306 + 0356 to a 3@xmath22 limit of 150 @xmath23jy at 1.4 ghz ( after convolving to the @xmath71 resolution corresponding to the box containing the x - ray jet ) .",
    "the flux density of the x - ray feature at 1 kev ( @xmath72 hz ) is @xmath73jy , assuming a spectral index of @xmath74 .",
    "a long standing and well documented technique for deriving magnetic fields in extragalactic radio sources is by comparing the radio synchrotron and x - ray ic flux densities ( harris & grindlay 1979 ) .",
    "the constraint on the magnetic field strength comes from the fact that the ic x - ray emissivity is a function of the relativistic electron density and the energy density in the dominant ambient photon field ( presumably the microwave background ) , and the synchrotron radio emissivity is a function of the relativistic electron density and the magnetic energy density .",
    "a recent simple parameterization of this calculation can be found in equation 4 in carilli & taylor ( 2002 ) . in the case of the jet - like x - ray feature in j1306 + 0356 , only a radio upper limit is available , such that we can only derive an upper limit to the magnetic field strength .",
    "using equation 4 from carilli & taylor ( 2002 ) , and the x - ray flux density and radio upper limits given above , we derive an upper limit of 3@xmath23 g to the magnetic field in the jet - like feature in j1306 + 0356 . note",
    "that this limit assumes the x - ray emission is ic , and that the relativistic electrons have a power - law energy distribution of index 3 over a wide range in energy ( see section 5.3 for more details ) .",
    "there has been considerable debate in the literature about the redshift evolution of the radio - loud fraction of qsos ( e.g. visnovsky et al . 1992 ; schneider , van gorkom , schmidt & gunn 1992 ; schmidt , van gorkom , schneider , & gunn 1995 ; hooper et al . 1995 ; goldschmidt et al . 1999 ; stern et al .",
    "most recently ivezic et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have investigated this question using large samples of qsos out to @xmath75 from the sdss .",
    "they conclude that about 8@xmath15 of qsos are radio - loud , independent of redshift .",
    "two out of the ten qsos at @xmath18 observed in our study are radio - loud , which is roughly consistent ( given the small number statistics ) with the fraction seen at lower redshift , eg .",
    "the poisson probability of seeing 2 radio  loud quasars when the expectation value is 0.8 is 14@xmath15 .",
    "as emphasized by ivezic et al ( 2002 ) , larger qso samples at high redshift are required to separate effects related to redshift - luminosity biases in flux limited samples .    the radio loud sources j0836 + 0054 and j0913 + 5919 are compact ( @xmath76  ) and have steep spectra ( 0.8 and 0.7 ) , classifying them as compact steep spectrum ( css ) objects .",
    "css objects are a mixed - bag of source types , ranging from steep spectrum core - jets ( size @xmath77 few pc ) , to small ( size @xmath78 kpc ) , double - lobed radio galaxies , ie .",
    "compact symmetric objects ( csos ; tzioumis et al .",
    "the csos are particularly intriguing since they are thought to be very young radio sources , and their ages can be measured through vlbi observations of the proper motions of the radio hot spots , with typical measured ages between 10@xmath79 and 10@xmath80 years ( polatidis & conway 2002 ) .",
    "recent vlbi imaging of j0836 + 0054 by frey et al ( 2003 ) at 1.6 ghz shows a marginally resolved source at 10 mas resolution , suggesting that this source is a steep spectrum core - jet , and not a cso .",
    "similar vlbi imaging has not been performed for j0913 + 5919 , but the lack of variability of this source ( section 3 ) makes it a prime candidate for a high redshift cso .    in either case , the fact that the radio - loud fraction of qsos appears to be relatively constant out to very high redshift , and that the two radio - loud qsos at @xmath18 discovered thus far have steep radio spectra , is encouraging from the perspective of studying the neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) during the epoch of reionization through observation of hi 21 cm absorption ( the 21 cm forest ) .",
    "calculations by carilli , gnedin , & owen ( 2002 ) , and furlanetto & loeb ( 2002 ) show that the next generation low frequency , large area radio telescopes , such as the lofar and the square kilometer array , will be able to study the neutral igm beyond the epoch of reionization ( eor ) in 21 cm absorption toward discrete radio sources as faint as a few mjy at frequencies below 200 mhz .",
    "both j0836 + 0054 and j0913 + 5919 would be easily adequate for such studies if they were placed beyond the eor .",
    "three of the ten sources in our study ( j0301 + 0020 , j0756 + 4104 , and j1044 - 0125 ) have been detected at ( sub)mm wavelengths with flux densities much larger than their 1.4 ghz flux densities .",
    "again , such steeply rising spectra provide strong evidence that the ( sub)mm emission is thermal emission from warm dust .",
    "we have considered these sources in the context of the radio - to - fir correlation for star forming galaxies , as quantified in the 1.4-to-250 ghz spectral index , @xmath81 ( figure 3 ) . for j0301 + 0020",
    "the @xmath67 value is clearly below that expected for a star forming galaxy . in this case",
    "it seems likely that the radio emission relates to the agn activity . for j0756 + 4104",
    "the @xmath67 value is within the range defined by star forming galaxies , while for j10440125 the lower limit to @xmath67 is at least consistent with a star forming galaxy .",
    "given the interest in co - eval massive black hole ",
    "spheroidal galaxy formation , it is instructive to consider what the properties of these sources would be if the 250 ghz emission were a result of dust heated by a starburst . using the relations between 250 ghz flux density , fir luminosity , and star formation rates , in omont et al .",
    "( 2003 ) based on typical spectra of low redshift ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( i.e. arp 220 ) leads to : @xmath82 l@xmath6 for j0301 + 0020 , @xmath83 l@xmath6 for j0756 + 4104 , and @xmath84 l@xmath6 for j10440125 , and massive ( @xmath85 m@xmath6 ) star formation rates of 200 , 1000 , and 500 m@xmath6 year@xmath2 , respectively . at these extreme star - formation rates",
    "most of the stars in a large spheroidal galaxy could form in a dynamical time of @xmath86  years .",
    "however , it should again be stressed that these rates assume the dust is heated by star formation , as opposed to being heated by the agn itself .",
    "we have not detected radio emission from the reported x - ray jet in j1306 + 0356 ( schwartz 2002 ) .",
    "the implied upper limit to the magnetic field ( 3@xmath23 g ) is more than an order of magnitude below typical magnetic field values in powerful radio jets .",
    "perhaps the simplest conclusion from these results is that the x - ray feature is not ic emission from a jet emanating from j1306 + 0356 .",
    "it is possible that such a jet could be inverse compton x - ray - loud and still be radio - quiet , even for strong magnetic fields , due to the different radiative lifetimes of the particles involved .",
    "the spectral peak of the cmb behaves as @xmath87(1+z ) hz , such that observations at 1 kev are sensitive to electrons with lorentz factors , @xmath88 , independent of redshift .",
    "the radiative lifetime of such electrons at @xmath3 is @xmath89 years . for comparison ,",
    "observations of a @xmath90 jet at 1.4 ghz probe electrons with @xmath91 , assuming a 50@xmath23 g magnetic field , corresponding to a radiative lifetime @xmath92 years .",
    "if particle acceleration ceased between 10@xmath93 and 10@xmath94 years ago , then the exponential cut - off at high energies in the relativistic particle population might lead to the situation observed , ie . an x - ray - loud but radio - quiet jet .",
    "more sensitive x - ray observations , and lower frequency radio observations , are required to test this interesting possibility .      for the highest redshift qso in our sample , j1030 + 0524 at @xmath9 ( figure  2 ) , we find four fairly bright radio sources ( @xmath95jy ) within 1   of the qso , one of which is an arcmin - scale powerful double ( frii ) radio source .",
    "note that for a 2   field one expects only 0.5 sources by chance with s@xmath96jy .",
    "it seems unlikely that the sources are at the redshift of the qso , since an arcmin - scale double radio galaxy has never been detected beyond @xmath97 ( carilli et al .",
    "interestingly , the highest redshift qso known , j1148 + 5251 at @xmath98 ( fan et al .",
    "2003 ) , also has two bright radio sources ( 8 and 70 mjy at 1.4 ghz ) within 1   of the qso position ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the excess radio source density in the fields of the two highest redshift qsos is that the radio sources are in a group or cluster that happens to lie along the line - of - sight .",
    "if this is the case , then gravitational lensing by the cluster could magnify the qso emission by a factor 2 or so without giving rise to arcsecond - scale distortions in the optical images of the qsos .",
