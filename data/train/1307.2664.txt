    "observations in the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) wavelengths ( 900 - 1750  ) provide a wealth of information regarding the physical and chemical processes in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "for example , many important ion emission lines associated with the cooling hot gas of t @xmath6 @xmath7-@xmath8k , such as @xmath5 977 , @xmath4 1032 , 1038 , and @xmath4 1548 , 1551 , exist in this wavelength range @xcite .",
    "the wavelength band also includes the fluorescence emission lines of the lyman transitions of molecular hydrogen , which arise in the photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the diffuse fuv continuum background radiation probes the dust scattering of starlight @xcite .",
    "hence , a variety of astrophysical targets have been analyzed based on fuv observations , such as supernova remnants ( snrs ; @xcite ) , superbubbles @xcite , diffuse and molecular clouds , and interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "fuv observations are also useful in the study of regions around bright stars .",
    "one example is the spica nebula .",
    "spica ( @xmath0 vir ) , located at ( _ l _ , _ b _ ) = ( 316@xmath9.11 , 50@xmath9.84 ) , is a binary system with a primary star of the b1 iii - iv type and a secondary star of the b2 v type , and is at the distance of @xmath680 pc from the sun in the direction toward the scorpius - centaurus ( sco - cen ) association .",
    "the spica nebula is relatively isolated , as revealed in the wisconsin h@xmath0 mapper ( wham ) image @xcite , and is characterized by a low gas density of 0.2  0.6 @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed its spectral images made for the * 1533 and 1671  lines and found enhancement of the * intensity in the southern region , a feature also seen in the h@xmath0 image .",
    "they attributed the feature to the density increase in the southern region .",
    "in contrast , the image of the 1671  line presented a broad central peak around the central star without significant enhancement in the southern region .",
    "the broad central peak was ascribed to the effect of multiple resonant scattering .",
    "an ambient dust cloud was also reported in the region from the analysis of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) 60 @xmath11 m and 100 @xmath11 m observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted the fuv halo around spica and attributed it to dust scattering of the central star spica .",
    "they tried to constrain the distance to the dust layers with a single scattering model .",
    "we will further discuss their results later for comparisons with our model .",
    "the spica nebula is located close to the so - called the `` interaction zone '' of the local bubble ( hereafter , lb ) and the loop i superbubble @xcite .",
    "the existence of the lb was inferred from the soft x - ray background observations @xcite .",
    "it is a low - density ( @xmath6 @xmath12 @xmath10 ) region with a radius of @xmath6 100 pc , inside which the solar system is embedded .",

    "the loop i is a large radio loop centered on ( _ l _ , _ b _ ) = ( 329@xmath9@xmath11@xmath9.5 , 17@xmath9.5@xmath13@xmath9 ) with an angular radius of @xmath658@xmath9 .",
    "it is believed to have been formed by multiple supernova explosions and/or strong stellar winds of the sco - cen ob association located at @xmath6170 pc from the sun .",
    "the boundary of loop i was observed to be expanding with a velocity of @xmath620 km s@xmath15 into the neutral ambient medium of density n @xmath6 0.6 @xmath10 , to form a dense neutral shell with column density _",
    "n _ ( ) of @xmath6@xmath16 @xmath14 at the terminal shock @xcite .",
    "there is a wealth of evidence that loop i consists of a low density ( @xmath6@xmath17 @xmath10 ) , hot ( @xmath6@xmath18 k ) and highly ionized x - ray emitting gas , generated by the interaction between the shock waves from the recent supernova explosions within the sco - cen association and the ambient neutral medium @xcite .",
    "the x - rays , together with the young ob stars of the sco - cen association , are believed to provide intense radiations that are responsible for the ionization of neutral gas at the loop i boundary , probably on the inner side of the boundary wall @xcite .",
    "the interaction zone is a huge ring - like feature of a dense neutral matter within the apparent boundary of the loop i shell , as identified by @xcite from the analysis of diffuse x - ray and 21 cm neutral hydrogen maps .",
    "the feature has been suggested to be a colliding structure of loop i with lb .",
    "@xcite predicted the ring - like feature using hydrodynamical simulations ; when a shock at the boundary of a bubble in a radiative stage makes contact with a shock of another bubble , a dense neutral wall of a ring - like shape with a density is 20  30 times higher than those of the ambient medium , would be formed at the intersecting points of the two bubbles .",
    "@xcite noted that the _",

    "@xcite set the upper limit of the distance of the interaction zone to be 80  100 pc since loop i , being still active with ongoing star formations , may have a higher pressure than the adjacent lb and push the interaction shell towards the lb .",
    "@xcite , using the strmgren photometry and column density measurements , estimated the distance to the interaction zone to be 120  150 pc . on the other hand , @xcite suggested that the ring - shaped interaction zone may be folded and warped as both the distance to the ring and the color excess values vary along the ring ; they estimated the distance to the interaction zone to be 110@xmath120 pc on the western side and 280@xmath150 pc on the eastern side .",
    "in this paper , we present the analysis results of the fuv observations of an extended region around the spica nebula that includes the interaction zone .",
    "the main goal of this study is to understand the morphological relationship between the spica nebula and the neighboring interaction zone as well as the scattering properties of the associated dust clouds using the fuv observations and radiative transfer models .",
    "we employed two datasets for this study : one is from the archival fuv data of galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ; @xcite ) , obtained as part of the all - sky imaging survey ( ais ) , and the other is the dataset used by @xcite , obtained from the far - ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ( fims ; @xcite ) aboard the korean microsatellite stsat-1 .",
    "both observations cover very similar fuv wavelength bands of 13501780  and 13301720  for galex and fims , respectively .",
    "they are complementary to each other in that the galex data have good statistics but no spectral information , while the fims data provides spectral information but with rather large statistical fluctuations due to relatively short exposure time and lower sensitivity .",
    "hence , we use the galex data for photometric analyses as it gives more reliable estimations of the diffuse fuv intensities than the fims data , and the fims data for spectral analyses as it can discriminate the fuv line emissions from the stellar continuum emissions .",
    "the galex sky background data ( with an extension of skybg ) , provided with a resolution of 16@xmath21 @xcite from the website http://galex.stsci.edu/gr6/ , were smoothed to obtain the final image with a resolution of 0.5@xmath9 .",

    "this conclusion accords well with the fact that the estimated distance to the interaction zone is @xmath670 pc , which is comparable to that of the spica nebula .",
    "there are two noticeable features in the fuv map : a halo around the central star @xmath0 vir and an extended feature that generally traces dust in the interaction zone .",
    "the fuv halo around @xmath0 vir is best seen in the northern region above the star and the halo is a dust - scattered feature of the @xmath0 vir starlight .",

    "the figure does show a general trend of increasing fuv intensity as _ e_(_b - v _ ) increases , except that the data points are severely scattered for the values of _ e_(_b - v _ ) from 0.04 to 0.08 while their intensities are limited to @xmath6 2000 cu .",
    "the severe scattering in the fuv intensity is clearly a distance effect as the fuv intensity depends strongly on the distance from the central star in this bright region close to spica , while the maximum value of @xmath6 2000 cu is a result of the brighter regions being excluded from the observations . nevertheless , excluding this large dispersion , we see an increasing dispersion of the fuv intensity with increasing _ e_(_b - v _ ) .",
    "@xcite & @xcite noted this property in the analyses of the fuv continuum background , and attributed it to the lognormality of the fuv intensity , caused by the turbulence property of ism .",
    "it is well known that the probability distribution functions of the ism density and column density are very close to lognormal @xcite . since",

    "it is remarkable that the results accord well with those of other independent observations .",
    "we also tried two - slab models , representing the lb and loop i boundaries , but the two slabs could not be separated effectively , perhaps because the density of the lb is similar to that of the ambient medium and thus the present models are not able to discriminate the shell of the lb from the ambient medium .     , title=\"fig:\",width=132 ]   , title=\"fig:\",width=132 ] +    , title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]",

    "the result shows that the emission comes mostly from the interface on the loop i side of the interaction zone while the emission is produced on the lb side of the interaction zone .",
    "as the fims wavelength band includes the doublet lines at @xmath61550  , we conducted a similar study for regions a and b in figure [ fig : spectrum](a ) , representing two distinct regions with different extinctions : region b , being part of the interaction zone , suffers more extinction for the emission originating from loop i than region a does .",
    "the average _ e_(_b - v _ ) for region a is @xmath60.015 after subtracting the background extinction of 0.015 , which is translated into the optical depth of 0.11 at 1565  , and the average value of _ e_(_b - v _ ) for region b is 0.075 after the background subtraction with a corresponding optical depth of 0.54 at 1565  . with the intensities",

    "the large error ranges are caused by the exponential factors associated with extinctions when the observed uncertainties of i@xmath49 and i@xmath50 are used to derived i@xmath47 and i@xmath48 .",

    "the following are the main findings of this study .    1 .",
    "the diffuse fuv radiation observed in the northern region above spica was mainly due to the dust - scattering of starlight originating from spica , while the diffuse fuv radiation in the southern region was attributed to scattering of photons originating from background stars by dust in the interaction zone .",
    "the fuv intensity showed a general correlation with the dust color excess _",
    "e_(_b - v _ ) .",
    "3 .   the ratio of neutral hydrogen to dust was about @xmath27 atoms @xmath14 , which is slightly higher than previous studies estimated for diffuse ism .",
    "diffuse emission was observed throughout the whole region , including the interaction zone . by considering the shadowing effect in the interaction zone",
    ", we found that a larger portion of the emission arises in the inner side of the shell boundary loop i than in the lb .",
    "molecular hydrogen fluorescence lines were also observed in the interaction zone .",
    "6 .   based on the dust scattering simulation using a monte carlo radiative transfer code , we estimated the optical parameters of dust scattering as follows : _ a _ = 0.38@xmath10.06 and _ g _ = 0.46@xmath10.06 , which are in agreement with previous radiative transfer studies as well as the theoretical dust grain models of the milky way .",
    "we found that the interaction zone is located @xmath6 70 pc away from the sun , with a thickness of @xmath640 pc , covering the southern neighborhood of the spica nebula .",
    "the central star spica is likely to be located between the two shells of lb and loop i.    fims / spear is a joint project of kaist and kasi ( korea ) and uc berkeley ( usa ) , funded by the korea most and nasa grant nag5 - 5355 .",
