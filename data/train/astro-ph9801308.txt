    "gravitational lensing of quasars by foreground galaxies provides us with a probe into the universe at high redshift .",
    "useful information may be gleaned from lensing systems including limits on the cosmological constant and the properties of high - redshift lens galaxies .",
    "lensing surveys also have the potential for detecting massive objects in the universe that might not otherwise have been located .",
    "radio surveys are particularly important for studying the population of lens systems as they are unbiased by extinction in the lens .",
    "mg0414 + 0534 was discovered in a survey for lenses conducted at the vla , and initial spectroscopy of this object marked it as unusual because of the extremely red optical continuum ( @xmath3 ) ( hewitt et al .",
    "it has a four - image geometry characteristic of lensing by an elliptical potential .",
    "the lens galaxy was first detected in @xmath4-band by schechter & moore ( 1993 ) .",
    "subsequently , ir images were obtained , and a redshift of 2.639 for the source was determined using near - ir spectroscopy ( lawrence et al .",
    "these ir images were not of sufficient resolution to detect the lens galaxy or to obtain separate photometry for components a@xmath5 and a@xmath6 .",
    "much improved optical photometry of the four images and lens galaxy and a detection of lensed arcs have been made with hubble space telescope ( falco , lehr , & shapiro 1997 , hereafter fls97 ) . to date , no redshift has been determined for the lens galaxy . because mg0414 is unusual in its redness , we have pursued further observations to understand the nature of the unusual quasar colors and their relation to the lens galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we present images of the system , which allow near ir photometry of all four images and the lens galaxy for the first time .",
    "we then present @xmath0-band spectra of the components of mg0414 which allow us to set limits on the amount of microlensing present .",
    "we conclude with implications that the galaxy colors have for the presence of dust in this and other galaxies .",
    "infrared images at @xmath7 ( 1.65@xmath8 m ) and @xmath0 ( 2.2@xmath8 m ) were obtained at the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) using a 128@xmath9128 nicmos2 array .",
    "@xmath0 images were taken on ut 1992 december 7 .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath0 images were taken on 1993 march 10 .",
    "one of the complications of observing at the mmt is the need to keep the images from the six telescopes coaligned .",
    "this drives the observing strategy , which is to stack the images on a bright star using the ir array , then to take three 60s exposures on source , and then to restack . before and after stacking , a 1s exposure of the bright star is recorded and is used as a photometric and psf reference .",
    "the seeing was typically 07 with 02/pixel .      because the resolution of the images is not much greater than the separations of the components , the only way to determine the brightnesses of the four quasar components and the lens galaxy is though psf fitting .",
    "we developed our own code that fits a model convolved with a psf image . in this case",
    "the model consists of four delta - functions and a devaucouleurs profile ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the general case has 18 free parameters ( x , y , and intensity for all 5 sources , plus the scale length ( @xmath11 ) , the ellipticity , and the position angle for the galaxy ) .",
    "we are able to reduce the number of free parameters to 9 by adopting hst values ( fls97 ) for the quasar locations and the galaxy location , ellipticity and position angle .",
    "we fit all 5 intensities , but reduce the positional data to solving for the x and y offsets , scale , and rotation of our coordinate system relative to the hst data .    ideally , for a psf",
    ", we would like to use a stellar image from the same frames that the lens data came from .",
    "unfortunately this is not possible as there are no suitably bright sources in the 26  field .",
    "instead we use the bright star that was observed before and after each realignment of the six telescopes .",
    "because telescope tracking errors are underestimated in the short exposures , the resulting psf images are slightly too narrow compared with the true psf",
    ". however , the amount of light in the wings of the psf should be correct . to correct for this error ,",
    "we additionally convolve the psf image with a small gaussian profile .",
    "the sigma of this gaussian is typically 01 , and is a 10th free parameter of the fit .",
    "figure  [ fig - kmarch ] shows the @xmath0 image from 1993 march .",
    "panels a - c show the observed image , model image , and the residual image , respectively .",
    "the final panel shows the lens galaxy , resulting from subtracting the four model qso images only . in table",
    "[ tab - photometry ] we tabulate the derived magnitudes of the components of the system . the galaxy magnitude represents the total magnitude of the devaucouleurs profile obtained from the fitting process . in table  [ tab - colors ] we list the colors of the components .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath4 data come from fls97 . for the galaxy ,",
    "fls97 measure the magnitude in a 182 diameter aperture . for a devaucouleurs profile with a 15 scale length ,",
    "35% of the total flux is in this size aperture .",
    "we use this correction factor of 1.14 mag to determine the optical - ir colors of the galaxy .",
    "we use the mean of the 1992 december and 1993 march @xmath0 data sets in computing the @xmath0 colors . a direct aperture measurement from figure  [ fig - kmarch]d yields the same galaxy magnitude to within 10% .",
    "the galactic extinction tabulated in ned for this line of sight is @xmath13=0.48 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath14 and @xmath15 = 0.23 ( savage & mathis 1979 ) .",
    "we ignore these comparatively small effects in the following discussions .",
    "uncertainties for the photometry have been estimated by making a set of ten simulated images .",
    "each of these images uses the derived model image obtained from fitting the original data .",
    "gaussian random noise is then added to match the noise level in the original data .",
    "we determine the random uncertainty in the fitted magnitudes by running the fit on each of the simulated images and computing the variance of the derived magnitudes . to allow for errors introduced by psf variations , in the @xmath16 column in table  [ tab - photometry ]",
    "we quote the larger of the uncertainties from the simulation and from taking half the difference between the two @xmath0 data sets . the uncertainties for components a@xmath5 and a@xmath6 are larger than for b because there is a substantial cross - correlation between the fluxes of the two close components .",
    "the noise properties of the @xmath7 and @xmath0 images are similar so we adopt the same uncertainties for the @xmath7 magnitudes .",
    "we have performed a number of checks to verify that our fitting procedure and psfs are robust . to verify that the a@xmath5/a@xmath6 ratio is not affected by psf errors we extract image b from the observed image by subtracting out the other model components .",
    "this image is used then as the psf and the data is refit . the resulting a@xmath5/a@xmath6 ratio changes by less than 10% in all three data sets .",
    "because the noise in the `` b '' psf image is quite large , it is not useful for estimating the flux in image c or the galaxy .",
    "we also have investigated the effect of changing the scale length of the galaxy , since fls97 quote an error bar of roughly 50% in this parameter .",
    "if we use @xmath17 , instead of 15 , ( a more drastic change than is required by the errors ) , we find that the galaxy flux measured in the 18 diameter aperture decreases by only 0.08 mag . the total flux integrated over the devaucouleurs profile does drop by a factor of two .",
    "the fluxes in the point sources change by roughly @xmath18 each .",
    "thus the derived point source photometry and the galaxy colors are independent of the assumed galaxy scale length .",
    "figure  [ fig - qsocol ] shows a color - color plot for the four images in mg0414 .",
    "also drawn is a reddening vector , showing that the differing colors can be naturally explained by variable amounts of extinction along the line of sight to the quasar .",
    "the length of the line corresponds to @xmath19 .",
    "the dusty galaxy explanation was previously argued by lawrence et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and is strengthened here with the separate a@xmath5 and a@xmath6 measurements at @xmath0 .",
    "if microlensing were taking place , we would expect that the continuum emission , emanating from the blackhole accretion disk , would be affected , but that the h@xmath2 line , coming from the larger , parsec - sized , broad - line region would be unaffected by microlensing .",
    "in other words , microlensing will change the h@xmath2 equivalent width . because microlensing affects each of the images independently",
    ", we would expect the equivalent widths of the four components to have different values if microlensing were significant .",
    "thus a single comparison of of the equivalent widths of the individual component is sufficient to set a limit on the amount of microlensing ; no time series is required .",
    "a @xmath0-band spectrum was obtained at the mmt on ut 1993 november 25 with fspec ( williams et al .",
    "1993 ) at a resolution of 800 .",
    "the slit location is shown in figure  [ fig - slit ] .",
    "the spatial fwhm was 11 with 04 pixels .",
    "the spatial resolution was good enough that we could extract two separate spectra for components a@xmath5/a@xmath6 and b. figure  [ fig - spectrum](a ) shows the spectrum of the a components , and ( b ) shows the ratio of the a and b spectra .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a single emission line , identified as h@xmath2 at a redshift of 2.639 ( lawrence et al .",
    "we compute that the equivalent width ratio between the two components is @xmath20 .    though we can not directly measure the line / continuum ratio between a@xmath5 and a@xmath6",
    ", we can obtain a limit for the close pair by measuring the change in spatial position of the spectrum as a function of wavelength .",
    "if the continuum is enhanced in image a@xmath5 , the centroid of the line will be biased towards a@xmath5 in the continuum region relative to the location in the line .",
    "figure  [ fig - spectrum](c ) shows a plot of the spatial position of the a@xmath5/a@xmath6 spectrum as a function of wavelength .",
    "the centroid in the line ( between the dashed lines ) compared with the surrounding continuum differs by @xmath21 . using 0017 as an upper limit",
    ", we derive an upper limit to the flux change between a@xmath5 and a@xmath6 of 0.22 .",
    "this is not as good a limit as for a vs. b , but could be improved with a higher s / n ratio spectrum",
    ". the technique could be useful for monitoring for microlensing in lenses with very close separations .",
    "witt , mao , & schechter ( 1995 ) ( hereafter wms95 ) , calculated histograms of the expected flux changes in the images of mg0414 due to microlensing for various source sizes sampled over time .",
    "they assumed the color differences among the components of mg0414 were due to microlensing and then derived an upper limit for the size of the continuum emission region .",
    "we can use the same distributions , combined with our upper limit on the microlensing effect on the line / continuum ratio , to derive a lower limit to the source size .",
    "note that it is is not appropriate to consider the wms95 lower limit and our upper limit as bracketing values for the correct source size as they originate from conflicting assumptions as to the amount of microlensing detected .    for a source size of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the average stellar mass of the lens galaxy , wms95 predict the the a@xmath5/a@xmath6 continuum ratio will have an rms scatter of 0.47 mag .",
    "the probability of observing @xmath24 is 0.33 .",
    "if we take their a@xmath5/a@xmath6 distribution as typical for a / b , then the probability of observing @xmath25 is 0.05 .",
    "this is an upper limit to the probability because the fluctuations in b are larger than those in @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the joint probability of observing both lower limits is 0.015 .",
    "thus , it is likely that either the source size is larger than stated , or the assumptions about the stellar population in the lens galaxy is incorrect .",
    "the microlensing models used in wms95 assume that all the galaxy mass is in stars , and for images a@xmath5 and a@xmath6 , the assumed mass density corresponds to @xmath28 , assuming @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . combining the galaxy profile in fls97 with the observed @xmath32 colors and the predictions of the stellar mass - light ratio from the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) models for an elliptical galaxy , we estimate the stellar density to be @xmath33 , at the location of a@xmath5/a@xmath6 . this model assumes a salpeter imf with stars ranging in mass from 0.1 to 125 @xmath34 .",
    "a resolution of the discrepancy between the predicted microlensing probability and the apparent lack of microlensing will require more detailed modeling , using the observed galaxy profile and knowledge of low - mass stellar populations from galactic microlensing experiments .",
    "based on figure  [ fig - qsocol ] we have argued that the different colors for the different components are due to differential extinction along the lines of sight and not likely due to microlensing .",
    "we can also rule out two other mechanisms which might cause apparent differing colors . if the source were varying intrinsically",
    ", we could infer different colors for the components since the observations were made at different times .",
    "however , the good agreement in the @xmath4-band photometry between schechter & moore ( 1993 ) and fls97 make fluctuations at the required 0.5 magnitude level extremely unlikely",
    ". the second possible mechanism for producing differential colors might be if the source size or geometry were a function of wavelength .",
    "this too can be excluded , via a simple model .",
    "if we consider the a@xmath5/a@xmath6 ratio as a function of source position , we find that for those source positions which produce images within 02 of the observed image locations , the flux ratio changes by less than 5% .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath12 positions agree to much better than this ; the flux ratios differ by much more . therefore source geometry can be excluded as a mechanism for the differential image colors .",
    "we can set a lower limit for the lens galaxy redshift using the fact that the ( unmeasured ) velocity dispersion ( or equivalently the mass ) of the lens galaxy is related both to the image separation and the galaxy luminosity as a function of redshift .",
    "redshifts where the velocity dispersion derived from the the image separation matches that derived from the galaxy photometry are viable lens redshifts . the faber - jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 )",
    "relates a galaxy s luminosity to its velocity dispersion .",
    "the relation we use , @xmath35 at @xmath36=0.023 , is derived from @xmath37-band photometry for the coma cluster ( dressler et al .",
    "we transform the relation from rest - wavelength @xmath37 to the observed @xmath0-band using the passively evolving spectral energy distribution for an elliptical galaxy described by mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) .",
    "this model was generated from the gissel galaxy evolution code ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "we prefer to use the observed @xmath0 magnitude rather than @xmath12 or @xmath4 for two reasons .",
    "first , at high redshift , the k corrections are better known than at shorter wavelengths , and second , if dust is responsible for the redness of the galaxy , the @xmath0 magnitude will better represent the true stellar luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the galaxy , @xmath16 , is related to the lens image separation , @xmath38 , via @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the distances from the lens and the observer , respectively , to the source ( e.g. blandford & narayan 1992 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - fj ] shows a plot of the expected velocity dispersion as a function of the lens redshift derived from the lens model ( dashed ) and the faber - jackson relation ( solid ) .",
    "the light lines represent 1@xmath16 errors due to the observed scatter in the faber - jackson relation .",
    "the point where the two curves cross is the best solution for the lens galaxy redshift .",
    "we can see that the relation is degenerate at high redshift so we can set only a lower @xmath42 limit of z=0.45 .",
    "we can set an upper limit for the lens redshift using the observed @xmath0 magnitude of the lens galaxy and assuming a bright limit for the absolute magnitude .",
    "there are a few known radio galaxies with @xmath43 with redshifts between 0.75 and 1.0 ( mccarthy 1995 ) . however , these are very rare objects and the lens galaxy is not a radio galaxy .",
    "a typical brightest cluster galaxy has @xmath44 ( sandage 1972 ) , i.e. , @xmath45 ( gardner et al . 1997 ) .",
    "such a galaxy would have the observed brightness of @xmath0=16 if it were at z=0.6 . because there is no apparent cluster surrounding mg0414 ( fls97 )",
    ", we view z=0.6 as a reasonable upper limit on the lens galaxy redshift .",
    "the lens galaxy is as red as any known galaxy of comparable magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig - ik ] shows a histogram of @xmath4-@xmath0 colors of field galaxies with @xmath46 from the hawaii field galaxy surveys ( gardner 1995 ) .",
    "the arrow marks the location of the mg0414 lens galaxy .",
    "a similar result can be seen for @xmath47 ( tyson 1988 ) .",
    "what could lead to such red colors",
    "? there could be at least two potential explanations : 1 ) the lens galaxy is at redshift z@xmath481 . in this case",
    "the k - corrections for a normal galaxy would give it approximately the correct colors .",
    "however , this would require the galaxy to be extremely luminous and we have argued above that the redshift is likely less than 0.6 .",
    "2 ) the galaxy is dusty ( lawrence et al .",
    "we prefer this explanation as it simply explains the unusual colors of both the galaxy and the quasar images simultaneously .",
    "figure  [ fig - galcol ] shows the observed @xmath47 and @xmath32 colors of the lens galaxy .",
    "the solid line is the expected track for the model elliptical galaxy as a function of redshift , showing that the observed colors are too red in both axes .",
    "the dashed line shows the effect of dereddening the galaxy assuming a uniform mixture of stars and dust . though the assumption of a uniform mixture is probably not quantitatively correct , it does qualitatively produce reasonable unreddened colors .",
    "this figure shows clearly the difference between redshift and dust reddening .",
    "we can see that the galaxy colors give z=0.6 and @xmath49 .",
    "the redshift is consistent with the upper limit derived above .",
    "the reddening matches reasonably well with lawrence et al.(1995 ) who argued that a@xmath50 in the galaxy is required to produce the observed qso colors , assuming a normal unreddened qso spectrum .",
    "another extremely red lens is mg1131 + 0456 , which has been studied in the ir by larkin et al .",
    "they derive @xmath51=5.3 for the lens galaxy , which is 0.5 mag bluer than mg0414 even after accounting for galactic extinction .",
    "they conclude that the lens galaxy of mg1131 is consistent with the spectrum of ngc4889 redshifted to 0.75 , but that the quasar colors require several magnitudes of @xmath52 .",
    "our elliptical evolution model predicts @xmath51=4.5 at z=0.75 , leading us to conclude that reddening in the mg1131 lens is also consistent with the galaxy colors .",
    "we note that although the ngc4889 colors are 0.4 mag redder in @xmath51 than our model , we would still argue that some reddening is required in mg1131 to match the ngc4889 colors .",
    "the colors of the mg0414 galaxy place it at the end of a red tail of the distribution of the colors of galaxies with similar brightness .",
    "in addition to the observed @xmath32 colors of field galaxies , figure  [ fig - ik ] shows the expected distribution of colors for @xmath46 galaxies using the evolving elliptical sed .",
    "a significant number of galaxies lie redward of the model , including the mg0414 lens galaxy .",
    "figure  [ fig - ik ] is qualitatively consistent with the analysis of lawrence et al ( 1995 ) which showed that two out of six radio selected lens systems showed large amounts of extinction .",
    "the large amounts of extinction in mg0414 suggest that the presence of dust in galaxies at z@xmath480.5 may be a dominant cause of the colors being redder than predicted by the models .",
    "near ir imaging and spectroscopy of mg0414 support the hypothesis that dust in the lens galaxy is responsible for the red colors of the qso images .",
    "the colors of the lens galaxy itself are consistent with large amounts of internal extinction .",
    "@xmath0-selected field galaxy surveys contain a significant number of galaxies that are redder than are predicted by stellar evolution models .",
    "the extinction seen through the red mg0414 lens galaxy suggests that dust may be the cause of red field galaxies .",
    "the lack of variation in the line / continuum ratios among the components argue against significant amounts of microlensing .",
    "this in turn argues against a small size for the qso accretion disk , or for problems in the stellar population assumptions used in the microlensing models ."
