    "@xmath1 as usual .",
    "everything of interest can be computed explicitly , and with surprising results .      consider the curve @xmath2 thought of as a point on a circle of radius @xmath3 turning at a rate @xmath4 in the clockwise direction as the centre of the circle rotates on a circle of radius @xmath5 rotating at a rate @xmath6 in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "for the small circle of radius @xmath3 to roll without slipping on the inside of the circle of radius @xmath7 requires the point @xmath8 to have velocity @xmath9 when @xmath10 , which is the relation @xmath11 because @xmath12 is rotationally invariant , without loss of generality we may take @xmath13      for our @xmath12 , the equations @xmath14 determining geodesics @xmath15 parameterized proportional to arclength are @xmath16 which can be expressed in terms of @xmath17 , as the single equation @xmath18 given the formula for @xmath8 it is straightforward to verify that @xmath8 satisfies ( [ z ] ) and moreover that @xmath19 , from which it follows that @xmath20 , meaning that the parameterization is by arclength .",
    "the closed geodesics ( i.e. keep rolling the generating circle of the hypocycloid until it closes up ) have length @xmath21 , and the number of geometrically distinct geodesics of length @xmath21 is given by the arithmetic function @xmath22 .    the function",
    "@xmath22 counts the number of different ways that the integer @xmath23 may be written as a product @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "values of this function are tabulated in sequence @xmath27 in the online encyclopedia of integer sequences @xcite .",
    "beginning at @xmath28 , the geodesic @xmath8 first returns to the boundary circle at @xmath29 returning again at points of the form @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding succession of cycloidal geodesic arcs winds clockwise around the origin if @xmath32 and counterclockwise if @xmath33 ; when @xmath34 , @xmath8 traverses back and forth along the @xmath35-axis .",
    "thus @xmath8 forms a once - covered closed geodesic precisely when @xmath36 for some relatively prime pair of positive integers @xmath37 , in which case the geodesic has length @xmath38 to count geometrically distinct closed geodesics we restrict to @xmath39 , in which case @xmath40 . given any relatively prime positive integers @xmath25 the geodesic of length @xmath41 occurs when @xmath42",

    "consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath46 for functions @xmath47 with the boundary value @xmath48 .",
    "this problem has a number of remarkable features .      1 .   the eigenvalues @xmath49 are precisely the positive integers @xmath50 .",
    "the eigenfunctions are polynomials .",
    "the dimension of the eigenspace for eigenvalue @xmath23 is the number of divisors of @xmath23 .",
    "( the number of divisors function is denoted by @xmath51 . )",
    "since the operator @xmath52 is analytic hypoelliptic , distributional solutions to the eigenvalue equation @xmath53 are necessarily real analytic , and representable near @xmath54 by absolutely convergent fourier series @xmath55 observing that @xmath56 has the form @xmath57 for some @xmath58 , it follows that @xmath47 is an eigenfunction of @xmath43 only if each summand @xmath59 is , so it suffices to consider just products of the form @xmath60 expressing @xmath61 in polar coordinates yields @xmath62 therefore @xmath63 is an eigenfunction of @xmath43 only if @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 assume for definiteness that @xmath66 and write @xmath67 , so that @xmath12 satisfies the hypergeometric equation @xmath68 where @xmath69 this has a unique non - singular solution ( up to scalar multiplication ) , the hypergeometric function @xmath70 which is zero at @xmath71 if and only if @xmath72 for some integer @xmath73 .",
    "this implies @xmath74 is a positive integer , proving part ( 1 ) of the theorem . if @xmath75 there are two corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath76 , making a total of @xmath77 eigenfunctions for each positive integer eigenvalue @xmath78 .",
    "that these are linearly independent ( part ( 3 ) ) , and that the eigenfunctions are polynomials ( part ( 2 ) ) can be verified using an explicit formula for the eigenfunctions , as follows .          in a more applied vein , consider a unit radius circular membrane fixed at the boundary ( i.e. a drumhead ) having constant tensile force per unit length @xmath84 and radially varying density @xmath85 .",
    "small transverse displacements of the membrane @xmath86 are governed by the equation @xmath87 so squared eigenfrequencies of the membrane correspond to eigenvalues of @xmath43 .    unlike the standard vibrating membrane whose eigenfrequencies are proportional to zeros of @xmath88 , for each eigenfrequency @xmath89 of ( [ harmonic ] ) , all the higher harmonics @xmath90 @xmath91 are also eigenfrequencies .",
    "supplemented by the sequence of monomials @xmath92 for @xmath93 , the eigenfunctions of @xmath43 are the special functions suited to acoustic imaging of layered media .",
    "a layered medium consists of a stack of @xmath94 horizontal slabs between two semi - infinite half spaces , where each slab and half space has constant acoustic impedance .",
    "thus impedance as a function of depth is a step function having jumps at the @xmath23 interfaces . to image the layers ,",
    "an impulsive horizontal plane wave is transmitted at time @xmath95 from a reference plane in the upper half space down toward the stack of horizontal slabs , and the resulting echoes are recorded at the reference plane , producing a function @xmath96 @xmath97 ( the boundary green s function of the medium ) .",
    "let @xmath98 denote the time required for acoustic waves to travel from the reference plane to the first interface and back , with @xmath99 denoting two - way travel time within each successive layer .",
    "when a wave travels downward toward the @xmath100th interface , it is partly reflected back , with amplitude factor @xmath101 , and partly transmitted , with transmission factor @xmath102 @xmath103 .",
    "expanding the binomial @xmath110 in the formula ( [ rodrigues ] ) , and then applying the derivative @xmath111 , yields @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 . switching to polar form @xmath115 , it follows that @xmath116 for @xmath117 , the latter coincide with the functions @xmath118 occurring in ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.4 , 4.3 ) .",
    "each term @xmath119 corresponds to the set of all scattering sequences that have a common arrival time @xmath120 , with each individual scattering sequence weighted according to the corresponding succession of reflections and transmissions .",
    "a scattering sequence may be represented by a dyck path as in figure  [ fig ] .",
    "the tensor products @xmath121 thus have a combinatorial interpretation in that they count weighted dyck paths having @xmath122 edges at height @xmath100 .",
