    "a hadamard matrix @xmath0 of order @xmath3 is an @xmath4 matrix with entries @xmath5 such that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the identity @xmath8 matrix .",

    "a circulant matrix is a matrix whose rows are cycle permutations as follows : @xmath15 and a circulant hadamard matrix is when it is additionally hadamard .",
    "a @xmath16 hadamard circulant matrix is one with first row containing three elements of the same sign and another element of a different sign , as for example in : @xmath17 we prove the _ circulant hadamard matrix conjecture _ , namely , that circulant hadamard @xmath11 matrices do not exist for @xmath18 .",
    "[ hada ] let @xmath0 be an @xmath8 hadamard circulant matrix",

    "the hadamard circulant conjecture appears to have been mentioned first in a book by ryser  @xcite but goes back further to obscure sources .",
    "what was known about their existence includes :    * turyn  @xcite proved that no circulant hadamard matrices of orders @xmath21 exist and excluded other orders of form @xmath22 .",
    "* a hadamard circulant matrix must either have order @xmath23 or @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "* there is no hadamard circulant matrix of order @xmath12 with @xmath24 with three possible exceptions  @xcite .    for connections between _",
    "ryser s conjecture _ , the circulant hadamard matrix conjecture and _ barker s conjecture _ see the monograph @xcite or paper  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : background ] provides the necessary background for the proof , which makes use of the connection between the group ring of the cyclic group and circulant matrices . when the multiplicative cyclic group @xmath25 with generator @xmath26 is listed in the ` natural ' order , namely @xmath27 , a circulant matrix is obtained .",
    "when a different listing is used this reduces the problem to working with certain block matrices . a different listing changes the corresponding matrix by interchanging rows and columns and thus if the original matrix is hadamard the matrix relative to the new listing is also hadamard .",
    "this new listing can be seen in retrospect to be more ` natural ' and shows why a circulant @xmath28 hadamard matrix when @xmath29 can not exist .",
    "as we explain later , they fail to be hadamard because of a certain ` twist ' that is introduced into the blocks formed . by avoiding this twist , hadamard matrices from group ring elements",
    "may be formed . using a listing in the group so that the corresponding matrix forms rows of @xmath30 blocks seems to be more natural",
    "this idea also leads to examples of hadamard _ almost circulant _ matrices ( section  [ gmatrix ] ) .",
    "the main part of the paper is the proof in section  [ sec : proof ] .",
    "the proof consists of the following steps :    * the re - derivation of the known result  @xcite , that @xmath12 must be a perfect square is initially derived . *",
    "the elements of @xmath31 are listed @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes @xmath34 .",
    "now form from the group ring @xmath35 the ( hadamard ) @xmath36-matrix relative to this listing .",
    "* this results in blocks @xmath37 which are either _ even _",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 or _ odd _",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "there are then an equal number of even and odd blocks .",
    "* for the matrix to be hadamard the odd blocks must occur in matching cancelling pairs ; this is shown to be impossible for @xmath18 .",
    "the natural question to then ask is if hadamard matrices can arise from other group rings .",
    "thus , in section  [ gmatrix ] , we provide examples of such matrices . these are formed within the group ring of @xmath42 and within the group ring @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the cyclic group of order @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the quaternion group of order @xmath47 .",
    "these can be extended to give hadamard group ring matrices over @xmath48 and over @xmath49 for any @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath50 can be replaced by @xmath51 to give similar examples .",
    "in this section , we introduce the necessary background in group rings , and related matrices .",
    "let @xmath52 denote a ring and @xmath53 a group .",
    "the _ group ring _ @xmath36 consists of all ( finite support ) @xmath54 with @xmath55",
    ". for further details on group rings see for example @xcite .",

    ". we shall be particularly interested in the case when @xmath53 is a cyclic group of order @xmath12 generated by @xmath26 .",
    "the matrix of @xmath53 , called the @xmath53-matrix , ( see for example @xcite ) , relative to this listing is @xmath57 suppose then @xmath58 .",
    "then @xmath59 gives an embedding of @xmath36 into the ring of @xmath60 matrices over @xmath52 relative to this listing of @xmath53 .",
    "call the above matrix the _",
    "@xmath36-matrix _ of @xmath61 relative to the given listing and call a matrix obtained from the group ring @xmath36 in this manner an @xmath36-matrix .",
    "@xmath36-matrix _ is used here as the methods are basically group ring methods .",
    "the structure of an @xmath36-matrix may clearly be seen in the following table : @xmath62 the first column is essentially _ labelled _ by @xmath63 , the second by @xmath64 etc . ;",
    "the first row is _ labelled _ by @xmath65 , the second by @xmath66 etc .",
    "as it aids in the calculation of an @xmath36-matrix relevant to a particular listing , this formulation will be called upon later .",
    "when @xmath67 is the cyclic group of order @xmath12 , we get a group ring @xmath68",
    ".    let @xmath69 denote the ring of circulant @xmath60 matrices which is a subring of @xmath70 , the ring of @xmath60 matrices over @xmath52 .",

    "the isomorphism makes it possible to move from the circulant matrices to the cyclic group ring and back , exploiting properties of both .",
    "let @xmath76 .",
    "then the @xmath36-matrix of @xmath61 relative to this natural listing is the circulant matrix @xmath77 suppose , in the general case , the listing is changed .",
    "any change of listing corresponds to a permutation of the elements of the group and a permutation is generated by transpositions .",
    "if the elements @xmath78 and @xmath79 are interchanged then the new matrix is obtained from the original matrix by interchanging the @xmath80 and @xmath81 rows and then interchanging the @xmath80 and @xmath81 columns .",
    "thus if an @xmath36-matrix relative to some listing is hadamard then the @xmath36-matrix relative to any listing , as one might expect , is also hadamard .",
    "for example , let @xmath53 be the cyclic group @xmath50 generated by @xmath26 with @xmath82 .",
    "then relative to the natural ordering @xmath61 has the hadamard circulant matrix @xmath83 .    when @xmath53 has the listing @xmath84 , @xmath61 has the hadamard matrix @xmath85 .",
    "the new listing is obtained by interchanging @xmath26 and @xmath86 in the original listing , and thus the new matrix is obtained from the original by interchanging the second and third rows and then the second and third columns .",
    "notice how the ` odd ' block @xmath87 of this new matrix gets ` twisted ' to a new type of ` odd ' block @xmath88 in the next row of blocks as indicated ; in this small case however this is not a problem as the even block still acts above and below the ` odd ' blocks .",
    "suppose now that @xmath0 is a circulant hadamard @xmath89 matrix .",
    "let @xmath31 be generated by @xmath26 and let @xmath61 be the element in the cyclic group ring @xmath90 corresponding to @xmath0 .",

    "there are then @xmath93 positive entries in each row and column .",
    "it is known that for any existing circulant @xmath89 hadamard matrix @xmath12 must be a perfect square  @xcite . for completeness",
    ", the following verifies this result and additionally provides information on the number of possible negative and positive entries .",
    "[ just ] @xmath94 .    the sum of the elements in any column is @xmath95 .",
    "the sum of the elements in a column except a positive element is thus @xmath96 and the sum of the elements in a column except a negative element is @xmath97 .",
    "the rows of the matrix are orthogonal to one another and thus the sum of the first @xmath98 rows is perpendicular to the last row .",
    "the last row has @xmath99 positive elements and @xmath92 negative elements .",

    "this implies that @xmath101 hence @xmath102 from which @xmath103 .",
    "solving this quadratic for @xmath92 gives : @xmath104 and so @xmath105 , as required .",
    "it then follows that the number of positive elements is @xmath106 , as expected from symmetry .",
    "the result of lemma [ just ] depends only on the fact that the same number of positive elements appears in each row and column . a hadamard matrix",
    "whose row and column sums are the same is known as a _",
    "regular hadamard matrix_. thus whenever @xmath36-matrices ( which include circulant matrices ) are hadamard , they are by necessity also regular hadamard matrices .",
    "the following may be proved along the lines of lemma [ just ] .",
    "[ just1 ] let @xmath107 be a @xmath28 matrix with orthogonal rows consisting of @xmath5 entries in which the same number @xmath108 of @xmath109 and the same number , @xmath92 , of @xmath110 appear in each row and column .",
    "then @xmath111 .",
    "the elements of the cyclic group @xmath112 are @xmath113 , listed in the ` natural ' ordering .",
    "write @xmath33 for @xmath34 so this listing is @xmath114 .",
    "now @xmath0 is a hadamard circulant matrix obtained from the @xmath36-matrix corresponding to an element of @xmath115 relative to this natural ordering .",
    "an interchange of rows or columns in a hadamard matrix results in another hadamard matrix .",
    "if two group elements are interchanged in the listing then the resulting @xmath36-matrix is obtained by interchanging two rows and then interchanging two columns and the result is thus a hadamard matrix .",
    "any new listing may be obtained by a succession of interchanges and thus if the listing is changed the new @xmath36-matrix obtained is still a hadamard matrix .",
    "list the elements of @xmath53 as follows : @xmath116 .",
    "using this ordering breaks the @xmath36-matrix into blocks of @xmath117 matrices and rows of these blocks .",
    "the inner product of any two ( different ) rows is @xmath91 as the matrix is hadamard .",
    "let @xmath118 denote the coefficient of @xmath34 in the @xmath36-matrix ; each @xmath118 is either @xmath119 or @xmath110 .",
    "consider now the @xmath36-matrix with this listing as constructed in of section [ grmatrices ] .",
    "the first two rows are then : @xmath120 the inner product of these two rows gives that @xmath121 . hence @xmath122 .",
    "thus one half of the products @xmath123 , @xmath124 , are @xmath109 and one half are @xmath110 .",
    "hence @xmath125 for @xmath126 consist of @xmath127 or @xmath128 for @xmath12 times and @xmath129 or @xmath130 for the other @xmath12 times .",

    "we now provide a couple of illustrations of these matrices , first from groups of direct products of cyclic groups , and then using a direct product of the quaternion group with cyclic groups .      in the cyclic ( circulant ) case a hadamard matrix is not obtained because of a ` twist ' in one of the pairs @xmath279 from the end of one block to the beginning of the next . by avoiding this ` twist ' a hadamard matrix that is ` almost ' circulant may be obtained .",
