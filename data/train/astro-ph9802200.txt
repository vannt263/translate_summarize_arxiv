    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) spectra often extend to very high energies with no indication of attenuation by photon - photon interactions .",
    "this implies substantial relativistic bulk motion of the radiating material with lorentz factors in the range of @xmath13 to @xmath14 . at cosmological distances ,",
    "grbs require an energy reservoir on the order of @xmath15 erg .",
    "the likely sources of such a reservoir would be the rest mass of a compact object released during a merger ( e.g. , either neutron star ",
    "neutron star or neutron star  black hole ) .",
    "however , most detailed calculations of mergers occur on time scales of less than 1 s , much less than the observed durations of grbs ( often @xmath13 s and sometimes @xmath14 s ) .",
    "two classes of models have arisen that explain various ( but not all ) aspects of the observations . in the `` external '' shock models ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the release of energy during the merger is very quick , and a relativistic shell forms that expands outward for a long period of time ( @xmath16 to @xmath17 s ) . at some point ,",
    "interactions with the external medium ( hence the name ) cause the energy of the bulk motion to be converted to gamma - rays . although the shell might produce gamma - rays for a long period of time , the shell keeps up with the photons such that they arrive at a detector over a relatively short period of time . if the shell has a velocity , @xmath18 , with a corresponding bulk lorentz factor , @xmath19 , then photons emitted over a period @xmath20 arrive at a detector over a much shorter period , @xmath21 .",
    "although this model is consistent with the short energy release expected for a merger and the observed long time scale of grbs , we have argued that it can not explain the long complex time histories except under extreme conditions ( @xcite ) . in particular , we argue from kinematic considerations that the long gaps often seen in grbs are inconsistent with local spherical symmetry , that the rapid time variability implies that only a small fraction of the shell becomes active , and that the observed average envelope of emission is inconsistent with that expected from a relativistic shell .",
    "these arguments are contained in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite argue from hydrodynamic considerations that the external shock model can not provide the energy or timescales observed in grbs .",
    "the alternative theory is that a central site releases energy in the form of a wind or multiple shells over a period of time commensurate with the observed duration of the grb ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gamma - rays are produced by the internal interactions within the wind ; hence these scenarios are often referred to as internal shock models .",
    "these models have two weaknesses : first , there is a concern that internal shocks are rather inefficient ( although , see @xcite ) , and second , the long , complex time history of a grb must be postulated at the central site . on the other hand , the free parameters associated with the multiple shells",
    "can probably explain any observed time history ( @xcite ) .",
    "the need to explain long time histories was further complicated by the discovery of the x - ray afterglows lasting hours ( @xcite ) , the optical afterglows lasting weeks to months ( @xcite ) , and the radio afterglows lasting many months ( @xcite ) .",
    "these extended time scales appear too long to have been produced by a lingering central site made by a merger .",
    "in addition , the observed power law decay is expected from many external shock models ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the initial gamma - ray phase is due to internal shocks from a relativistic wind ( or multiple shells ) that merge into a single relativistic shell which then produces the afterglows in a manner similar to the external shock models .",
    "this model avoids the difficulty of explaining the rapid variability of the gamma - ray phase with a single shell while retaining the long time scale capability of the single shell for the afterglows .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the external shock model can not utilize the full surface of shells .",
    "fundamentally , it arises because of the relatively rapid time variability of the gamma - ray phase .",
    "@xcite use this as an argument that external shock models would require too much energy .",
    "however , this should not be considered a strong argument that the grb phase is not external shocks since there are several scenarios that can utilize only a portion of the shell s surface .",
    "we also analyze the time variability recently observed by asca in the x - ray afterglow of gb970828 ( @xcite ) and show that its time variability implies low surface utilization in the x - ray afterglow phase as well .",
    "to understand the problem caused by rapid variability , one must emphasize the difference between arrival time at the detector ( which we denote with @xmath8 ) and coordinate time ( equivalent to laboratory time , the detector rest frame time , _ and _ the rest frame of the central explosion , denoted by @xmath20 ) .",
    "coordinate time is measured by clocks placed at all locations within the frame and can measure when the photons were produced .",
    "in contrast , a detector ( such as batse ) measures when the photons arrive at a single location .",
    "these two times are related as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angle between the direction of motion of the emitting material and the direction to the detector .",
    "the large bulk lorentz factor means that the shell is almost certainly moving directly at the observer s detector ( i.e. , we must be looking at the shell head - on rather than looking at the sides of a jet , so @xmath23 is small . when @xmath23 is 0 , @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , the lorentz transformation between the time in the rest frame of the detector ( @xmath20 ) and time in a frame moving with the shell ( @xmath25 ) , is @xmath26 .",
    "consider the early behavior of the shell .",
    "assume that clocks are placed along the path of the shell in the detector s rest frame .",
    "these clocks report coordinate time , that is , the time the shell passes the location of the clocks . consider an extreme case such as @xmath27 .",
    "clocks placed with a spacing of @xmath28 cm will see the shell pass their locations at times separated by @xmath29 s. because the shell is viewed by the detector head - on , its movement causes the shell to keep up with the photons it produces such that photons that were separated by @xmath29 in the detector s rest frame , arrive at the detector separated by a much shorter interval @xmath30 .",
    "if the shell expands in the detector rest frame for @xmath17 seconds , the photons all arrive at the detector within 5 s. note that this contraction of the photon arrival time is not the result of a lorentz transformation .",
    "rather , it reflects that a detector at a single location measures when photons arrive , not necessarily the relative time they were emitted .    in the early phase of the shell s expansion , @xmath3 is effectively constant ( @xmath31 ) such that @xmath32 .",
    "eventually , the shell begins to deaccelerate as it sweeps up the interstellar medium ( ism ) . without detailed knowledge of the physical process that generates the gamma rays ,",
    "it is not clear if the expansion is adiabatic or dominated by radiation losses .",
    "however , both solutions lead to a power law decay ( @xcite ) , and we will show that our conclusions only depend on the power law nature of the decay and not the exact index of the power law . for the sake of an example , we will assume that the expansion is adiabatic .",
    "the energy required to sweep up an ism mass of @xmath33 is @xmath34 ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath35 be the initial energy deposited into the shell such that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the original mass of the shell .",
    "if @xmath38 is the density of the ism , one can solve for the radius of the shell as a function of the coordinate time by solving @xmath39 here ,  is the angular size of the ejecta to account for the situation where the expansion is mechanically confined to a jet .",
    "the arrival time of the photons as a function of the coordinate time that the photons were emitted can be found from @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath20 as a function of @xmath8 for a typical situation ( @xmath42 erg , @xmath43 atom @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is unclear what fraction of the shell s energy is converted to gamma - rays .",
    "observations imply that the energy in gamma - rays _ if the explosion is isotropic _ is on the order of @xmath15 erg . if   is much less than @xmath45 , much less energy is required ( implying many more unseen events ) .",
    "the observations only limit the energy per @xmath45 steradian to be @xmath46 erg .",
    "we scale our solutions to @xmath42 erg which assumes that @xmath47 1% of the energy is converted to gamma - rays .",
    "there are three phases of the @xmath48 relationship : the initial constant-@xmath3 phase , a phase where @xmath49 , and a final phase when the shell becomes nonrelativistic where @xmath20 is @xmath8 plus a constant . here",
    ", @xmath50 is @xmath35 in units of @xmath51 erg and @xmath52 is the ism density in units of 1 atom @xmath44 .",
    "the second and third phase is only weakly dependent on the initial conditions .",
    "neither depends on the initial @xmath53 , and they depend on the other parameters to the 1/4 power . thus , except for the duration of the first phase , different bursts ought to have similar @xmath48 relationships . if one assumes the extreme nonadiabatic case that the momentum of the shell is conserved rather than the energy , then the 1/4 power becomes 1/7 .",
    "many other indexes as possible ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although the exact nature of the conversion of bulk motion to gamma - rays is unclear , we argue that the gamma - ray phase must be contained in the first phase where @xmath54 .",
    "we note that many grbs show a similar time of arrival structure ( e.g. , observed subpeak widths ) at the end of the burst and at the beginning of the burst . in the first phase , the observed arrival time structure ( @xmath7 )",
    "is related to the emission time as @xmath55 such that a constant subpeak width can occur if the emission time is constant in coordinate time . in the second phase , @xmath56 such that constant subpeak width can only occur if the emission time ( @xmath57 ) scales as @xmath58 .",
    "this is consistent with our scaling of @xmath42 erg , which allows the first phase to last 200 s ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the afterglows probably occur in the @xmath59 phase where @xmath3 is more modest .",
    "as one can see from figure 1 , our view of grbs becomes quite distorted because we only measure arrival time at the earth rather than the time of emission in the earth s rest frame ( remember , no lorentz transformations are involved ) .",
    "it is often said that grbs are quite quick , say 30 s. actually , in the external shock models , they occur longer by @xmath60 or , perhaps , up to @xmath61 s if @xmath3 is @xmath14 .",
    "the afterglow period seems to cover a very large dynamic range from @xmath14 s to @xmath17 s. actually , because @xmath59 , the dynamic range is only a factor of 10 .",
    "in the external shock model , there is a single shell , and the rapid variability we observe can only be accounted for by a nonuniform production of gamma - rays by the shell .",
    "consider batse bursts 1883 and 2993 shown in figure 2 .",
    "they have very similar overall envelopes of emission and similar intensities . burst",
    "2993 , however , has stronger deviations from the envelope in the form of multiple peaks .",
    "presumably this structure arises because various patches ( or emitting `` entities '' ) on the shell randomly become active . in the case of burst 1883 , so many entities become simultaneously active that the overall envelope appears quite smooth , whereas in the case of burst 2993 , fewer entities become active so random fluctuations in the number of simultaneously active entities cause the peak structure to be spiky . in this view , each observed peak in not necessarily caused by a single entity , but the peak structure is caused by random variations in the number of active entities ( see @xcite ) .    in @xcite and @xcite , we showed that the expected envelope of the grb phase has a `` fred '' like shape ( fast rise , exponential decay although the decays are often just slower , not necessarily exponential ) .",
    "the expected envelope is a power law , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the spectral number index ( typically @xmath64 ) .",
    "( note that this power law refers to the grb phase in constrast to the well observed power law decay found in the afterglows . ) in @xcite , we showed that the volume that contributes to a set period of time , @xmath7 , is constant .",
    "the @xmath65 envelope comes from the beaming .",
    "thus , if the entities form randomly , one can expect that the rate of entities causing peaks is effectively constant during the decay phase .",
    "indeed , the presence of long gaps in grbs is one of our key arguments that the grb phase is not due to a simple single shell .",
    "gaps require large causally disconnected regions to coordinate their lack of emission ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we define the `` surface filling factor '' as the fraction of the shell s surface that becomes active .",
    "let @xmath66 be the area of an entity and @xmath67 be the number of entities that ( randomly ) become active during the interval @xmath68 . if @xmath69 is the area of the shell that can contribute during @xmath68 , then the surface filling factor is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the fraction of the visible area of the shell ( @xmath72 ) that contributes during the interval @xmath68 .",
    "the number of entities can be determined from the observed fluctuations in the time history .",
    "the overall envelope is due to the beaming , so the residue variations about the overall envelope are due to a combination of the poisson variations in the number of entities and the poisson variations associated with the count statistics .",
    "assume for the moment that the contribution due to the count statistics are small such that the variations come from the poisson variations in the number of contributing entities .",
    "we first remove the envelope by fitting a polynomial function to it .",
    "the observations are divided by the polynomial function , so the result is a flat envelope with variations due to the number of entities that , on average , are active simultaneously .",
    "the rate of occurrence of the entities , @xmath73 , can be found directly from the variations because the observed mean level is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is some constant and the variance is @xmath76 .",
    "we define @xmath77 to be the observed mean level of the flattened envelope and @xmath78 to be the root mean square of the flattened envelope . in the case of no contribution from the counting statistics ,",
    "@xmath73 would be @xmath79 . here",
    ", we have implicitly assumed that all entities are identical .",
    "this is supported by the fact that peaks within grbs usually are similar to each other .",
    "the actual root mean square of the flattened envelope is a combination of the variance due to the entities and the variance due to the counting statistics , @xmath80 .",
    "we assume they add in quadrature , that is , @xmath81 .",
    "we estimate @xmath82 to be root mean square of many monte carlo realizations of the flattened envelope .",
    "the rate of occurrence of entities is @xmath83 this rate is the number of events per the time scale of the entities .",
    "thus , the total number of entities that occur within a period @xmath68 is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the time scale for a single entity .",
    "we have consider several scenarios that relate the size of an entity causing a peak to an observed peak duration , @xmath85 ( see table 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "here , we consider the two most likely scenarios for the formation of a peak : regions that grow and regions formed by the interaction with the ism .",
    "consider a gamma - ray producing region that grows at the speed of sound , @xmath86 , for a period @xmath87 in the rest frame of the shell where presumably the region is symmetric .",
    "this growth might be associated with a developing shock .",
    "let @xmath88 be the radius of the region in the rest frame along the direction of the motion and @xmath89 be the radius in the perpendicular direction such that @xmath90 the sizes in the rest frame of the detector are related to the sizes in the rest frame of the shell as : @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "combining the effects of the movement of the shell during the growth with the maximum size that the entity can grow in time @xmath57 , we find that the duration in arrival time is ( see table 1 of @xcite ) : @xmath93^{1/2}~. \\eqno(\\neweq)\\ ] ] the size of the emitting entity is @xmath94}~~. \\eqno(\\neweq)\\ ] ]    the alternative cause of a peak resulting from the shell is that the shell interacts with an ambient object such as an ism cloud .",
    "presumably , the object is symmetric such that @xmath95 .",
    "( we use lower case @xmath96 for an object that grows in a shell and upper case @xmath97 for an ambient object . )",
    "we assume the case of a `` collapsible '' object ( such as an ism cloud , cf .",
    "the contribution to the peak duration from time the shell takes to move through the cloud ( i.e. , @xmath98 $ ] ) is negligible compared to the time the shell takes to engage the perpendicular size of the object .",
    "this engagement time is caused by the curvature of the shell . at an angle @xmath23 from the line of sight , the time to engage the object is @xmath99 . note",
    "that table 2 of @xcite was incorrect for @xmath100 ; see @xcite .",
    "at a typical angle of @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 thus , both the case of shocks that grow from a seed and the case of shells running into ambient objects are similar . if @xmath104 , then @xmath66 from equation ( ) is 16/13 times larger than from equation ( ) .",
    "these two scenarios only differ by a constant the order of unity .",
    "the final ingredient for the calculation of the surface filling factor is the area of the shell visible to the observer : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is either the angular width of the shell [ i.e. , @xmath107 ) ] or it is @xmath108 , whichever is smaller . before the shell starts to deaccelerate , presumably @xmath106 is larger than @xmath109 . using @xmath110 ,",
    "the above was derived for the adiabatic case .",
    "more generally , equation ( b ) becomes @xmath119 where @xmath120 is 1 for the adiabatic case and 0 for the radiative ; @xmath121 is a parameter that varies from 0 to 1 depending on whether most of the energy or most of the mass is concentrated at low @xmath3 s ; and @xmath122 is a parameter that varies from 0 to 1 depending on whether the emitting electrons are radiatively efficient or adiabatic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more involved power laws are possible when one includes variations in the ambient material ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the surface filling factor from equation ( ) depends on @xmath123 . for a power law relationship between @xmath20 and @xmath8 , @xmath124 . assuming that each entity is similar in the rest frame , different deaccelerations ( i.e. , various values of @xmath120 , @xmath122 , @xmath121 ) only modify the equation for @xmath5 by a numerical factor on the order of @xmath125 .",
    "we conclude that surface filling factors found in the next section are roughly what one would find for any deacceleration scenario as long as @xmath126 .",
    "the consistency of the peak duration throughout the gamma - ray phase implies that @xmath3 is rather constant . in this case , the surface filling factor is a function of @xmath71 ( from eq . [ ] ) , and the direct observables ( @xmath127 , and @xmath8 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath116 is either 16 or 13 depending on whether the source of the entity is due to ambient objects or shocks that grow , respectively .",
    "if ambient objects were involved , we would expect to see peaks with a wide range of durations , perhaps a power law distribution .",
    "in fact , most grb peaks are about the same size ( @xcite ) , so we will use @xmath128 for the gamma - ray phase . to estimate @xmath71 , one needs to estimate the fraction of the visible shell ( i.e. , @xmath72 , the area within a beaming angle of @xmath2 ) that contributes to the signal during time @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know how , in general , to map the amount of active area of a shell to the observed time history . only in the particular case of a fred - like burst",
    "can we reliably estimate @xmath71 . for a fred - like burst",
    ", the curvature of the shell delays the photons from the region of the shell at angle @xmath2 by @xmath129 where @xmath129 is the time that the shell expands before producing gamma - rays . from @xcite and @xcite",
    ", one can find @xmath129 from the shape of the profile .",
    "given that the profile shape is @xmath130 , @xmath129 is @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the duration of the burst that contains 50% of the event counts ( see batse catalog , @xcite ) .",
    "here , @xmath63 is the spectral number index , typically @xmath64 .",
    "thus , if one uses @xmath133 , then the profile is from the region of the shell out to an angle of @xmath2 , and @xmath134 .    for long complex bursts",
    ", we can not easily detect a fred - like shape . in lieu of an exact estimate",
    ", we will use the rule found for fred - like bursts : @xmath135 . in table 1 , we list 6 fred - like bursts and 46 long complex bursts that were bright and had sufficient time structure for estimating parameters . the first column gives the batse trigger number .",
    "the second column gives @xmath73 as found from equation ( ) .",
    "the third column gives an estimate of @xmath85 , the temporal width of a single entity .",
    "in most cases , this was estimated from the width of the autocorrelation function . for four of the fred - like bursts ,",
    "the profiles were rather smooth ( presumably due to a larger number of entities being simultaneously active ) so we used a typical value for @xmath85 ( i.e. , 0.5 s ) .",
    "the 4-th column is @xmath132 and the next two columns are , respectively , the surface filling factor and its propagated error based on equation ( ) .    in figure 3",
    "we show the distribution of surface filling factors as a function of burst duration @xmath132 .",
    "the solid squares are the fred - like bursts , and the open squares are the long complex bursts .",
    "although some of the smooth fred - like bursts can have surface filling factors near unity , most bursts have values on the order of @xmath136 .      in figure 4 , we show the time history of burst gb970828 observed by the asca satellite , from 28.9 to 48.9 hours after the gamma - ray phase ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . at about 36.1 hours",

    "@xcite also reported variations from a simple power law decay in the x - ray afterglow of gr970508 .",
    "these two examples of deviations from a power law decay are quite different . in the case of the @xcite observation ,",
    "the flare is relatively narrow ( i.e. , @xmath137 is small ) . in the case of the @xcite observation",
    ", the deviation could be a step function increase in the intensity ( i.e. , @xmath138 , although there is a data gap from 22 to 65 hr after the grb that obscures the nature of the deviation ) .",
    "we will emphasize the @xcite observation because the narrow nature of the flare gives much stricter limits on the relativistic shell ( see   5 ) . except for earth occultations ,",
    "asca continuously observed the afterglow from 28.9 to 48.9 hr after the grb .",
    "the observations have been prorated into samples of equal duration in figure 4 .",
    "consider how case c in equation ( ) applies to gb970828 .",
    "we must estimate the fraction of the shell that contributes to the 20 hours of observations , @xmath71 . we can estimate a lower limit on @xmath71 , and therefore , an upper limit on @xmath5 . in case c",
    "we assume that the whole shell was active , but only a fraction ( @xmath71 ) of it contributed during the asca observation .",
    "the narrowest annulus that contributes during any particular observation is one with a width equal to the size of a single entity . at a typical angle of @xmath2",
    ", @xmath71 can be as small as @xmath139 at smaller angles , @xmath71 would be smaller , but that is counteracted by the fact that the peak in the asca observation is clearly much smaller than the whole observation , such that the annulus responsible for the observation must be larger than we used in equation ( ) .",
    "we only have observations covering a small range of time , so we can not use equations ( ) and ( ) to estimate @xmath67 .",
    "however , there are probably only a few active entities because we see only one peak in figure 4 . hence",
    ", we will use @xmath140 as the maximum number of entities involved in the asca flare .",
    "thus , using case c , @xmath5 is , at most , @xmath141 , a value very similar to what is obtained in the gamma - ray phase . in figure 3",
    ", the asca flare for case c is represented by the solid triangle .    in the situation of case",
    "b , we do not know   or @xmath71",
    ". however , the smallest @xmath71 when the shell s angular size is limited to   is @xmath142 such that @xmath143^{-1/4 }   { \\gamma \\delta t_p \\over t^{1/4 } } = { 1.6 \\times",

    "is @xmath147 which implies a filling factor of @xmath9 .",
    "the x - ray afterglow suffers from the same time history problems that the gamma - ray phase has : peaks do not have the value of @xmath137 expected from a shell whose surface quasi - uniformly emits photons .",
    "the rapid variations in grb time histories imply emitting entities the size of @xmath148 . assuming a _ single _ expanding shell , these entities must form on a much larger surface , @xmath149 .",
    "we have defined @xmath5 ( given by eq . [ ] ) to be the fraction of the surface of the shell which becomes active , that is , generates emitting entities . a crude estimate of @xmath5 is @xmath150 . because both the classic gamma ray burst phase and the recently discovered x - ray afterglow phase can have flares with @xmath151",
    ", both time periods can suffer from an inefficient utilization of a single relativistic shell .    in the case of the gamma - ray phase",
    ", there is a simple explanation : the gamma - ray source is not a single relativistic shell , but rather , reflects activity at some central site that produces @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 for up to several hundred seconds .",
    "other observations , particularly gaps seen in the gamma - ray time histories ( @xcite ) , also argue for a central engine .",
    "the x - ray afterglow , however , is widely interpreted as being a single relativistic shell ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we will concentrate our discussion on how to accommodate flares during the x - ray afterglow .",
    "these arguments could also be applied to the gamma - ray phase .",
    "of the two examples of deviations from a power law in the x - ray afterglow , the @xcite event ( gb970828 ) is much more restrictive than the @xcite event ( gb970508 ) .",
    "gb970828 has a narrow flare whereas gb970508 appears to be roughly a step function .",
    "a step function is similar to a fred - like deviation which is approximately what one would _ expect _",
    "if most of the observable surface of a relativistic shell interacts with a large ism cloud ( i.e. , @xmath137 should be @xmath152 , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , gb970828 might be an afterglow with a low surface filling factor whereas gb970508 has a high surface filling factor .",
    "a common misconception is that one can just use an ism cloud that covers most of the shell s surface and , therefore , make a flare that substantially changes the emission .",
    "this does not work because the curvature of the expanding shell prevents the shell from engaging the cloud instantaneously .",
    "rather , the portion of the shell at @xmath153 requires a time @xmath154 longer to reach the cloud . even if the cloud happens to have a concave shape such that the shell reaches the cloud simultaneously over a wide range of angles , the resulting photons at @xmath101 must travel further to the detector resulting in emission that is delayed by @xmath155 .",
    "indeed , the delay of the photons due to the curvature is identical to the scenario of a shell that expands without producing photons for a long time and then emits only over a small range of times ( the @xmath156 case in @xcite ) .",
    "the result is a fred - like flare ( like gb970508 ) whose duration , @xmath7 , is about @xmath8 , rather than a small fraction of @xmath8 as indicated by the asca observations for gb970828 .",
    "the shell will have well - defined curvature because all points on it are moving at nearly the same speed , that is , the speed of light . in any case , there is no reason to believe that variations in the ambient material would cause the shell to develop into a plane wave oriented towards the observer such that the photons produced by an interaction with an ism cloud or a shock would arrive as a short flare . _",
    "only the instantaneous interaction between two plain parallel surfaces oriented perpendicularly to our line of sight can produce a short peak from large surfaces .",
    "_    we see six possible explanations for flares with small @xmath137 that produce large changes in the observed intensity .",
    "these explanations are explained below and represented in figure 5 .",
    "a key issue is the size of the corresponding energy reservoir required in each case . to intercompare these energy requirements",
    ", we use that a typical peak corresponds to an isotropic luminosity , @xmath157 , equal to @xmath158 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the total energy reservior is required to have @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the average duration of the event ( say , 30 s ) and @xmath161 is the fraction of the total energy that is converted into gamma - rays ( say @xmath162 ) . if the emission is isotropic , then the total energy is about @xmath163 erg .",
    "since we can not observe the energy released at angles much greater than @xmath164 , any model can reduce the required energy reservior to @xmath165 . although the energy requirement can be made small , a single shell that emits nearly uniformly over  ( see fig .",
    "5a ) is not consistent with the observed time structure since a uniform shell always results in a fred - like shape .",
    "the following scenarios can produce bursts with peaks with small @xmath137 :    1 .",
    "the simplest way to have short powerful flares is to invoke a central engine . in a central engine , there are multiple releases of energy at the central site over a time scale commensurate with the observed duration of the grb .",
    "each release makes a peak in the time history .",
    "indeed , small @xmath137 and gaps are the key kinematic reasons why the grb phase is likely to be a central engine ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible for a large fraction of the surface of the shell to be active , and the flare region might still be small , because @xmath161 or the energy content of the shell varies strongly as a function of position on the shell .",
    "that is , the photons @xmath166 s@xmath1 at the flare site must be larger than the rest of the shell by a factor of @xmath167 ( see fig .",
    "5b ) . for example",
    ", some photon production rates scale as @xmath168 , so a single region with a @xmath3 that is 10 times larger than other regions could produce emission that doubles the overall count rate",
    ". this would give the appearance that @xmath5 is @xmath169 . if the energy content of the shell is constant as a function of angle and @xmath161 varies",
    ", then the required total energy is about @xmath170 .",
    "if @xmath161 is constant , and the energy content of the shell varies , then the total required energy is @xmath165 .",
    "the third explanation is that the local spherical symmetry of the shell is broken into many emitting regions on a scale much smaller than @xmath2 where only a fraction @xmath5 of the surface converts its energy into photons .",
    "the regions are small enough ( @xmath171 ) to make peaks with small @xmath137 ( see fig .",
    "5c ) . here",
    "it is assumed that all regions of the shell has equal energy content but much of it is wasted because most regions do not produce gamma - rays .",
    "thus , this scenario requires an energy reservoir of @xmath170 , that is , @xmath172 _ more _ energy than a simple shell . if  is large , this scenario could require @xmath173 to be as large as @xmath174 erg .",
    "@xcite invoke this explanation and the resulting need for more energy to argue against a single relativistic shell .",
    "that arguement should not be considered particularly strong since we have several scenarios that do not waste the energy and/or  could be small .",
    "the fourth explanation is that the local spherical symmetry is broken because the outflow of material is in narrow fingers that occupy only a fraction @xmath5 of the shell s surface ( see fig .",
    "this is basically the same geometry as the previous case except those regions that do not emit gamma - rays do not have energy content .",
    "since no energy is wasted in non - emitting regions , this scenario requires an energy reservoir of only @xmath165 , that is , about what one would expect from a simple shell .",
    "the fifth explanation is that  is very small , so small that the emission lasts only @xmath85 even if the entire  region is gamma - ray active .",
    "this requires  to be @xmath175 .",
    "the requried total energy is correspondingly small : @xmath176 erg .",
    "this explanation has one narrow ejecta that needs to go through a gamma - ray emitting phase for each peak in the grb time history . in the above explanation ( number 4 ) , there are many narrow ejecta , so each one only has to become gamma - ray active only a few times to make a grb time history with hundreds of peaks .",
    "the last explanation attributes the duration of the grb to the spreading out in time of the emission because of different conditions as a function of @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "this is what we called a `` thick shell with substructure '' in @xcite .",
    "it would have been better to call it a `` thick emitting region with substructure '' since the actual emitting shell must always be thin ( cf .",
    "effectively , @xmath5 is unity but it appears to be small because the assumptions involved in equation ( ) are not valid .",
    "let @xmath177 be the time that the @xmath178-th section of a shell at @xmath179 expands before becoming active .",
    "let @xmath180 be the speed of the material at @xmath179 .",
    "the relative time that the emission from two different regions ( @xmath178 and @xmath181 ) arrive at our detector is @xmath182 explanations 3 and 4 , above , assume that all @xmath177 s and @xmath180 s are equal such that we can estimate the size of the shell from it s fred - like appearance and peaks arrive at different times because they come from different @xmath179 s .",
    "of course , most bursts are not fred - like . in this explanation ,",
    "all @xmath179 regions become active ( so @xmath5 = 1 ) , but the peaks that would have added up to make the fred - like envelope are scattered in time because of the different @xmath177 s and @xmath180 s . to disrupt the fred - like shape ,",
    "@xmath183 s must vary by a factor of at least 2 from what they would be if everything was constant with @xmath23 .",
    "consider the effect of different times of emission ( i.e. , different @xmath177 s but similar @xmath180 s ) . the @xmath177 s would have to vary by about a factor of 2 to change @xmath183 s by a factor of 2 . consider constant @xmath177 s but different @xmath180 s . to spread out out the emitting regions so their distance from us varies by about @xmath8 requires that @xmath184 or that the radius of the shell is @xmath185 the @xmath186 and @xmath187 would have to vary by about @xmath188 .",
    "such differences could arise from different baryon loading as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "there are two observations that argue against this explanation .",
    "first , even the bursts with fred - like envelopes show low filling factors ( see the solid squares in fig .",
    "second , if the @xmath186 s differ by @xmath188 , then peak near the end of the burst should have widths that are at least a factor of 2 wider .",
    "bursts normally do not appear to have such a trend .",
    "this explanation requires an energy reservoir like a uniform shell : @xmath165 .    in conclusion , both the gamma - ray phase and the x - ray afterglow show similar rapid variability , both have values of @xmath189 that are similar .",
    "such variability implies that either grbs are central engines , or that the local spherical symmetry is broken on a scale much smaller than @xmath2 . in the last case",
    ", the structure can either be due to variations in @xmath3 as a function of @xmath23 ( perhaps due to small scale variations in the baryon loading , explanation 6 above ) , or due to only a fraction @xmath5 of the shell becoming active ( explanations 3 , 4 , 5 above ) .",
    "the required total energy is @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 for explanations 3 , 4 , and 5 , respectively .",
    "using typical values , the total energy can vary from @xmath174 to @xmath193 erg .",
    "we note that explanation 5 ( a jet much narrower than @xmath2 ) is the only explanation that can also easily explain gaps in the time history .",
    "we thank cheng ho and chuck dermer for useful comments .",
    "jay norris provided the time histories analyzed for figure 3 .",
