    "<S> we report studies of the magnetospectroscopy of graphite into a new regime of high energies and ultra - high magnetic fields which allows us to perform the first spectroscopic studies of the interlayer split off bands , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these bands can be well described by an asymmetric bilayer model and have only a small interlayer band gap asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we show that all of the properties of the electrons and holes can be described by a simple relativistic behaviour determined by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent surge in interest in two dimensional electronic systems formed from monolayer @xcite and bilayer graphene@xcite , is based on the properties of bulk graphite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the many exciting properties of bilayer graphene are crucially dependent on understanding the interlayer coupling that originates in bulk graphite . </S>",
    "<S> there is mounting evidence@xcite that the majority of the properties of graphite can be described quite simply at the high symmetry points of the brillouin zone by a combination of a single layer graphene ( slg ) model for massless dirac fermions at the @xmath4-point and a bilayer ( blg ) model for massive particles at the @xmath5-point . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic and theoretical estimates of the band parameters still remain controversial however , particularly around the @xmath5-point , as only very limited experimental evidence exists of the properties of the interlayer split off bands , @xmath0 and @xmath1 formed by the interlayer coupling which is dominated by the matrix element @xmath3 in bernal stacked layers . by using ultra - high magnetic fields </S>",
    "<S> we now extend the magnetospectroscopy of graphene and graphite into a new regime of high energies which allows us to perform the first magnetospectroscopy of the interlayer split off bands and show that their behaviour can be modelled very well by the analogue of relativistic behaviour predicted by the blg model .    </S>",
    "<S> traditionally the band structure of graphite has been described by the slonczewski - weiss - mcclure ( swm ) tight binding model@xcite which requires the use of seven tight binding parameters @xmath2 .... @xmath6 determined by interlayer and intralayer matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a description of the dispersion relations all around the brillouin zone edge from the hole pocket centered at the @xmath4-point to the electrons around the @xmath5-point . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the slg / blg model uses @xmath2 with only a single interlayer matrix element , @xmath3 , and is found to provide a remarkably accurate @xcite description of the magneto - optical properties of graphite by assuming that this is dominated by the @xmath4- and @xmath5-points . even at low energies where </S>",
    "<S> the band structure is known to be more complex@xcite , the slight modification of introducing an asymmetric velocity for the @xmath5-point fits the data very well@xcite and can describe most of the behaviour predicted in the swm model . in the simplified bilayer picture </S>",
    "<S> the band structure is shown in fig.[schema]b , with the k - point having two touching symmetric massive bands and split off bands at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> introduction of the asymmetric bilayer model ( abm ) ( as occurs due to the presence of @xmath8 in the swm ) means that @xmath1-@xmath9 and @xmath0-@xmath10 become symmetric pairs of bands each with their own respective fermi velocity , @xmath11 and @xmath12 which are predicted to differ by @xmath1310% in both the swm model and density functional theory .     </S>",

    "<S> measurements were made of the transmission of thin ( @xmath1320 nm ) exfoliated natural crystalline graphite up to magnetic fields of 160 t at 300k . </S>",
    "<S> fields were generated using a semi - destructive single - turn coil technique shown schematically in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the transmission of a series of lasers in the region 1550 - 630 nm was detected using high speed photodiodes and a 200 mhz low noise amplifier to follow complete cycles of the pulsed magnetic field , allowing the rising and falling parts of the magnetic field cycle to be compared and averaged . </S>",

    "<S> the strongest high frequency series are assigned to the ( @xmath15 ) transitions between the @xmath16 @xmath5-point landau levels , by extrapolation from previous work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lower frequency resonances are , however , previously un - reported , and are due to transitions from and to the split - off bands .    </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the magneto - optical response by introducing a fourier analysis procedure which allows us to isolate the in - plane quantization effects and separate out the contributions from the different bands when working at fixed photon energy . </S>",
    "<S> the periodicity of the transitions in reciprocal magnetic field can be seen from an analysis starting from the bilayer approach for the @xmath5-point@xcite , where we write    @xmath17^{1/2 } ,    \\label{e1 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the magnetic energy for the graphene - like in - plane motion    @xmath19    where @xmath20 ( with different values for the electrons and holes in the abm ) , s = @xmath21 for the electrons and holes , and @xmath14 = @xmath22 corresponds to the fundamental and split - off bands . </S>",

    "<S> the values for @xmath29 predicted by equation [ e5 ] are within @xmath35 of the values predicted by the full bilayer model for @xmath36 , using the same values for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , suggesting that the observed behaviour should be very accurately periodic in 1/b and can be used to determine these parameters without the need for qualitative judgements of the fitting accuracy for multiple peaks .    for transitions involving the layer split - off bands we have a similar expression with similar accuracy .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37    where @xmath38 = @xmath39 for transitions between the layer split - off bands and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) and @xmath38 = @xmath43 for transitions directly between the two layer split - off bands ( @xmath44 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these simple expressions are a consequence of the intermediate energy zero field result @xcite for a bilayer :    @xmath45    where the momentum @xmath46 has been quantized at @xmath47 and the transition energy e=2@xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is an exact analogy of the relativistic energy momentum relationship where @xmath3 plays the role of the particle rest mass@xcite . including the split off bands </S>",
    "<S> gives the set of relativistic dispersion relations :    @xmath49    the pairs of bands are asymmetric which is a feature of both the swm and ab initio calculations using density functional theory@xcite which predict @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> both types of theory also predict that the @xmath51 and @xmath52 interlayer gaps should be asymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the swm model predicts for example that ( @xmath53 ) = 2(@xmath54 ) = 2@xmath55 , with typical fitting parameter values from the literature suggesting a wide range of values for 2@xmath55 in the region 0.06 to 0.3 ev @xcite and tight binding models predicting 0.1 - 0.2 ev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of the transition energies plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ periodicity ] can then be calculated from the differences of the energies in eq.[e8 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online)transition energies as determined from the fourier filtered plots shown in fig.[absorptionft ] and calculated from the abm . ]    for a fixed photon energy the magnetic field values for the transitions are thus expected to show a very well defined periodic dependence on 1/b with a periodicity ( @xmath56=1/@xmath57 ) given by equations [ e5 ] , [ e7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results demonstrate that this prediction holds extremely well </S>",
    "<S> . plots of 1/b values for the absorption minima show ( fig . [ absorptionft]c ) a very accurate harmonic series and fourier transforms of the traces in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ absorptionft]a as a function of 1/b ( fig [ absorptionft]b ) show well defined peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the highest periodicity peak ( 300 - 1300 t ) corresponds to the the well known @xmath5-point @xmath16 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the transforms show the appearance of two new peaks for energies more than 1 ev ( 1220 nm ) ( 100 - 400 t ) and 1.8 ev ( 690 nm ) ( 50 - 200 t ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the new series correspond to transitions involving the split off bands , the first from a combination of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and the second directly from @xmath1-@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the periodicities of all three transitions are used to give the k - vector ( = @xmath60 ) and then plotted as energy - k - vector dispersions in fig.[periodicity ] with the periodicities determined both from 1/b plots and from the fourier transforms . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath61 transitions show excellent agreement with eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ e5 ] using typical values for @xmath2=3.18 ev ( @xmath32=1.03 @xmath3310@xmath34 m/s ) and @xmath3=0.39 ev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since these transitions correspond to high quantum numbers , @xmath28 , they measure the average of the values for @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( which we later show to be : @xmath64=1.14 @xmath3310@xmath34 m/s and @xmath65=0.92 @xmath3310@xmath34 m/s ) and it is impossible to resolve any electron - hole splitting . fitting the periodicities for the @xmath1-@xmath0 transitions with eq.[e7 ] </S>",
    "<S> also gives good agreement with the same parameter values for the average @xmath32 and a total gap of 4@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the @xmath66 transitions are more surprising , however , as these require a significantly higher value for @xmath32 and a reduced value for the band gap of 0.725 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that transitions from @xmath67 are dominant , where both bands have the higher fermi velocity and the band gap is reduced due to the asymmetric interlayer coupling@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a well defined periodicity in 1/b allows us to examine the split - off band transitions in more detail by using a fourier blocking filter in 1/b to remove the higher frequency oscillations from the ( e@xmath68 ) transitions , as shown in figure [ absorptionft ] . for each recording a second trace </S>",
    "<S> is shown where the data has been processed with a fourier blocking filter over the range ( @xmath69 ) which removes the oscillations associated with the @xmath16 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we first analyse the @xmath70 transitions which are compared directly with the exact abm predictions for low quantum numbers as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ e1e3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to make an accurate fit for @xmath3=0.39 ev , since this is the only parameter which enters into the @xmath70 separation , even in the full swm model .    </S>",
    "<S> as already suggested above , the second series of transitions from @xmath71 require an increased value of @xmath2=3.63 ev ( @xmath72=1.14 @xmath3310@xmath34 m/s ) when fitted with either eq.[e7 ] or the full asymmetric bilayer model eq.[e3 ] , with a suitably reduced value of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that at high fields the transitions are dominated by the symmetric pair of bands @xmath1 and @xmath9 , which have a higher electron velocity due to the band asymmetry associated with the @xmath8 term and the free electron contribution @xcite in the swm model . the two velocities are slightly more asymmetric than observed previously in low field measurements on graphite@xcite and for monolayer@xcite and bilayer @xcite graphene , which is not unexpected given that our measurements use a larger range of energies . </S>",
    "<S> another potential explanation is that coulomb many - body interactions are becoming larger at higher energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[e1e3 ] illustrates the exact transition energies calculated using the asymmetric bilayer model for all of the layer split band transitions with a value for ( @xmath53 ) = 0.11 @xmath21 0.04 ev . </S>",
    "<S> there are very few direct measurements of the asymmetry but a value of 0.13 ev was observed by bellodi et al@xcite from thermoreflectivity measurements at zero field . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements study transitions which are strongly influenced by the fermi level occupancy of the states around the @xmath5-point which makes their interpretation difficult@xcite but they are nevertheless in good agreement with our measurements , which suggests that the layer split band gaps @xmath73 and @xmath74 are significantly less asymmetric than often thought and should provide a good constraint for values used in fitting theoretical models of graphite . </S>",
    "<S> our value for @xmath74 of 0.725@xmath75 is also in good agreement with that reported from arpes measurements ( 0.71@xmath76)@xcite , although this method could not observe the upper band . </S>",
    "<S> split off band transitions have been observed with bilayer graphene where electroreflectance measurements@xcite measure split off bands at half the energy for graphite due to the single sided coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the resonances at 0.363 and 0.393 ev are slightly less asymmetric than our graphite values where considerably more interlayer coupling is occurring .    </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most remarkable conclusion is that the dispersion relation for all of the interband excitations can be deduced from the simple quasi - relativistic dispersion relations eq.[e8 ] with slightly more asymmetric velocities than reported previously@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in the visible region of the spectrum </S>",
    "<S> all of the excitations can be considered to be in the relativistic region of the dispersion relation . </S>"
