    "the discovery of a possible accelerated expansion of our present universe from type ia supernovae ( @xcite ) , is perhaps the most remarkable cosmological finding of recent years .",
    "furthermore , the flatness of the universe ( @xmath0 ) determined by cosmic microwave background observations ( @xcite ) , togheter with the low matter density ( @xmath1 ) inferred from large scale structure ( @xcite ) are suggesting the presence of a cosmological constant with high statistical significance .",
    "however , the cmb+lss result relies on the assumption of a particular class of models , based on adiabatic primordial fluctuations , cold dark matter and a cosmological constant as dark energy component . in the following",
    "we will refer to this class of model as @xmath2-cold dark matter ( @xmath2-cdm ) .",
    "this weak point , shared by most of the current studies , should not be overlooked : it might be possible that a different solution to the dark energy scenario than a cosmological constant can affect the cmb+lss determination .",
    "it is therefore timely to investigate if the actual cmb data is in complete agreement with the @xmath2-cdm scenario or if we are losing relevant scientific informations by restricting the current analysis to a subset of models .    here",
    "first we check to what extent modifications to the standard @xmath2-cdm scenario are _ needed _ by current cmb observations with a model - independent analysis obtained fitting the actual data with a phenomenological function and characterizing the observed multiple peaks through a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) algorithm , which allows us to investigate a large number of parameter simultaneously ( @xmath3 in our case ) .",
    "we found a very good agreement between the position , relative amplitude and width of the peaks obtained through the model independent approach with the same features expected in a @xmath4-parameters model template of @xmath2-cdm spectra .",
    "second , since the @xmath2-cdm is a good fit to the cmb data , we then move to other possible candidates for the dark energy component to see what kind of constraint we can obtain .",
    "the common characteristic of alternative scenarios to a cosmological constant , like quintessence or domain walls , is that their equations of state , @xmath5 , might differ from the value for a cosmological constant , @xmath6 .",
    "observationally finding @xmath7 different from @xmath8 will therefore be a success for the alternative scenarios .",
    "we found that the present cmb and lss data can put strong constraints on the values of @xmath7 assumed as a constant .",
    "we model the multiple peaks in the cmb angular spectrum by the following function :    @xmath9    where , in our case , @xmath10 . we use this formula to make a phenomenological fit to the current cmb data , constraining the values of the @xmath3 parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for the cmb data",
    ", we use the recent results from the boomerang-98 , dasi , maxima-1,cbi , and vsa experiments .",
    "the power spectra from these experiments were estimated in @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 bins respectively ( for the cbi , we use the data from the mosaic configuration ) , spanning the range @xmath19 .",
    "for the dasi , maxima - i and vsa experiments we use the publicly available correlation matrices and window functions .",
    "for the boomerang and cbi experiments we assign a flat interpolation for the spectrum in each bin @xmath20 , and we approximate the signal @xmath21 inside the bin to be a gaussian variable . the likelihood for a given phenomenological model is defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the gaussian curvature of the likelihood matrix at the peak .",
    "we consider @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath26 gaussian distributed calibration errors for the boomerang-98 , dasi , maxima-1 , vsa , and cbi experiments respectively and we include the beam uncertainties by the analytical marginalization method presented in ( @xcite ) .",
    "the phenomenological fit is operated through a mcmc algorithm .",
    "the mcmc approach is to generate a random walk through parameter space that converges towards the most likely value of the parameters and samples the parameter space following the joint likelihood , the posterior probability distribution .",
    "a description of the method used can be found in @xcite .",
    "as reported in @xcite we found an excellent agreement between the @xmath2-cdm scenario and the model - independent fit .",
    "this result is evident in figure 1 where we plot the best - fit phenomenological model with the best - fit obtained under the assumption of a @xmath4 parameters @xmath2-cdm template .",
    "since the present cmb data is in wonderful agreement with the @xmath2-cdm scenario , we can now try to extend the set of theoretical models , allowing for values of the dark energy equation of state different from @xmath8 .",
    "however , as already stressed by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) it is necessary to combine the cmb data with different data sets in order to obtain reliable constraints , since each dataset suffers from degeneracies with the remaining cosmological parameters .",
    "even if one restricts consideration to flat universes and to a value of @xmath7 constant in time then the sn - ia luminosity distance and position of the first cmb peak are highly degenerate in @xmath7 and @xmath28 , the energy density in quintessence . in fig .",
    "2 we report the @xmath29 and @xmath30 likelihood contours in the @xmath31 plane @xcite with the inclusion of the new cbi , vsa and archeops datasets .    the equation of state parameter is constraied to be @xmath32 at @xmath30 c.l . , in agreement with the @xmath33 cosmological constant case and giving no support to a quintessential field scenario with @xmath34 . a frustrated network of domain walls or an exponential scaling field are excluded at high significance .",
    "in addition a number of quintessential models are highly disfavored , like , for example , power law potentials with @xmath35",
    ". however dark - energy phantom models with @xmath36 ( see e.g. @xcite ) can be in agreement with the data we considered .",
    "the result is consistent with other recent independent analyses ( see @xcite in these proceedings and references therein ) .",
