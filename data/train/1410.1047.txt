    "the devices are then released in hydrofluoric acid ( @xmath76 aqueous hf solution ) and cleaned in a piranha solution ( @xmath77-to-@xmath78 h@xmath79so@xmath80:h@xmath79o@xmath79 ) before a final hydrogen termination in diluted hf . in fabrication ,",

    "[ sfig : setup ] .",
    "a fiber - coupled , wavelength tunable external cavity diode laser is used as the light source , with a small portion of the laser output sent to a wavemeter ( @xmath82-meter ) for frequency stabilization .",
    "the remaining laser power is sent through an electro - optic phase modulator ( @xmath83-m ) , used to generate optical sidebands for locking the filter cavities , and a variable optical attenuator ( voa ) to allow control of the input power to the cavity .",
    "the signal is then sent into an optical circulator which sends the optical probe to the a lensed fiber tip for end - fire coupling to the device .",
    "the cavity reflection can then be switched to one of two detection setups .",
    "the first allows the signal to be switched to a power meter ( pm ) for measuring the reflected signal power or to an erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) followed by a high - speed photodetector ( pd ) .",
    "the resulting photocurrent can be sent to a real - time spectrum analyzer ( rsa ) in order to measure the noise power spectral density ( npsd ) of the optical signal or to a vector network analyzer ( vna ) which can be used to measure the full complex response of the optical cavity .",
    "the second detection setup sends the cavity reflection through a series of narrowband tunable fabry - perot filters ( @xmath84  mhz bandwidth , @xmath85  ghz free - spectral range ) in order to reject the pump frequency .",
    "the signal then travels through a variable coupler ( vc ) and is sent to the dilution refrigerator where is is detected by two superconducting single photon detectors ( spd ) .",

    "since the pump laser is tuned to a motional sideband during the phonon counting measurement , the two fabry - perot filters used in this work must be tuned to the optical cavity resonance via an initial lock and stabilization procedure .",
    "this procedure is as follows .",
    "first , the pump wavelength is tuned to the blue or red omc sideband by optimizing the mechanical transduction signal on a spectrum analyzer .",
    "since the power of the radiated stokes- or anti - stokes - scattered light is too low to provide a feedback signal for filter stabilization , we then bypass the omc and phase - modulate the pump at frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the filters are then locked to maximize transmission of the sideband which is resonant with the cavity . after a stabilization period of a few seconds , the filter positions are held without further feedback while the pump modulation is turned off , pump power is adjusted for the desired @xmath21 , and the omc is switched back into the optical path . once locked , the transmission of the filters is observed to be stable to within @xmath86 for several minutes in the absence of active feedback locking .    in order to avoid pile - up artifacts  @xcite in the acquired @xmath24 histograms presented in the main text ,",
    "the photon count rate incident upon the spds is kept at or below @xmath87  khz .",
    "this is accomplished with a variable optical attenuator on the output of the filters , and is sufficient to maintain a flat histogram background over a @xmath49  @xmath88s window . the absolute count rate reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : count_rate]a takes the variable attenuation into account .",

    "consequently , the complex response of the cavity is measured by locking the laser off - resonance from the cavity and using a vector network analyzer ( vna ) to drive an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) and sweep an optical sideband across the cavity . by detecting the reflected power on a high - speed photodetector connected to the vna input , the phase response of the cavity",

    "the operating range of the detector lies between a lower cutoff current and an upper switching current @xmath110 , above which the nanowire switches to a non - superconducting state .",
    "the choice of quiescent operating current @xmath109 for each detector was made to roughly maximize the ratio of the quantum efficiency @xmath111 to dcr while operating within the `` plateau '' region where both @xmath111 and the dcr are nearly constant as @xmath109 is adjusted slightly .",
    "the spds are mounted on the still stage of a @xmath112he/@xmath113he dilution refrigerator at 700 mk .",
    "single - mode optical fibers ( corning smf-28 ) are passed into the refrigerator through vacuum feed - throughs and coupled to the spds via a fiber sleeve attached to each spd mount .",
    "proper alignment of the incoming fiber with the @xmath114 @xmath88 m @xmath115 @xmath114 @xmath88 m square area of the spd nanowire is ensured by a self - aligned mounting system incorporated into the design of the spd  @xcite .",
    "the radio - frequency output of each spd is amplified by a cold - amplifier mounted on the @xmath39  k stage of the refrigerator as well as a room - temperature amplifier , then read out by a triggered picoquant picoharp 300 time - correlated single photon counting module .",
    "the counting module is triggered by input pulses reaching a voltage above a fixed discriminator value @xmath116 .",
    "amplified photon - detection pulse heights of @xmath117  mv are typical , and corresponding discriminator values in the range @xmath118  mv were chosen for each spd by measuring nominal count rates as a function of @xmath116 and choosing an operating value of @xmath116 to be near the center of the plateau region in which the observed count rates are independent of small changes in the discriminator setting .",
    "initial characterization of the spds was centered on measuring dark count rates and the quantum efficiencies of the detectors .",
    "the measured dcrs are sensitive to various channels by which stray light may couple into the fiber - detector system , including ambient laboratory lighting and thermal radiation both inside and outside the refrigerator . by tightly spooling ( @xmath119  inch diameter ) the optical fiber within the fridge to filter out long wavelength blackbody radiation and systematically isolating the optical fiber from environmental light sources we have achieved dcrs of @xmath120  c.p.s .",
    "quantum efficiency measurements of the spds were made using laser light of @xmath121  nm attenuated to an input power of @xmath122  fw at the input to the fridge , corresponding to @xmath123 incoming photons per second .",
    "we calculate @xmath111 by referring the detected photon count rate ( less the corresponding known dcr ) to the nominal input flux @xmath124 .",
    "this efficiency incorporates the intrinsic detection efficiency of the spds as well as any losses in the fiber run within the fridge and in the coupling between the fiber and the spd itself . at just below the respective switching currents of the detectors , we find @xmath125 , with this result depending on photon polarization ( @xmath126 variability )",
    "for sufficiently weak optomechanical coupling ( @xmath127 ) and small mechanical amplitude , the equations of motion for the optomechanical system can be linearized about a large steady state optical field amplitude . for a sideband resolved system ( @xmath128 ) and a red - detuned pump ( @xmath129 ) the output optical field",
    "may then be written in the fourier domain ( in a frame rotating at the pump frequency ) as  @xcite    @xmath130    where @xmath131 ( @xmath132 is the steady - state optical field at the pump frequency , @xmath133 is the vacuum noise of the pump ) , @xmath134 is the intrinsic loss rate of the optical cavity , @xmath135 is additional vacuum noise admitted via the intrinsic loss channels , and @xmath136 is the annihilation operator for the acoustic resonator .",
    "note that @xmath137 takes the place of @xmath136 for a blue - detuned pump ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "as @xmath136 is sharply peaked around @xmath139 , we can spectrally filter out the strong optical pump at @xmath140 .",
    "the additional optical noise , assumed to be white gaussian noise , can not be filtered out in this way .",
    "however , in the case that the optical noise is pure vacuum noise it will not contribute to any photon counting events .",
    "thus , for the purposes of photon counting the output optical field can be written post - filtering as    @xmath141    which shows explicitly that in this linearized regime photon counting is equivalent to phonon counting ( @xmath142 ) .    as can be seen in the above equation ,",
    "the optically induced acoustic damping rate @xmath102 physically represents the per - phonon rate of sideband photon emission , corresponding to phonon absorption ( emission ) for @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . of the sideband photons emitted into the optical cavity ,",
    "a fraction @xmath143 are subsequently emitted into the detection channel and detected with overall system efficiency @xmath44 , including both the system efficiency of the spds as well as insertion loss along the path from cavity to detector .",
    "the count rate per phonon is thus given by @xmath144 , and the total count rate is given by    @xmath145    where @xmath47 is the average phonon occupancy of the acoustic resonator , @xmath146 is the count rate due to residual pump transmission through the filters , and @xmath38 is the intrinsic dark count rate of the spd .    to assess the sensitivity of the phonon counting measurement , the noise count rate can be divided by the per - phonon sideband count rate to obtain a noise - equivalent phonon number    @xmath147    the dark count rate @xmath38 is simply a measured constant , while @xmath148 , where @xmath45 is the transmission of the filters at the pump frequency relative to the peak transmission , and @xmath149 is the input photon flux of the pump , which is nearly perfectly reflected from the cavity when the pump is far off - resonance .",
    "for a pump detuning from the cavity of @xmath2 , the input photon flux can be related to the intracavity photon number @xmath21 by @xmath150 .",
    "thus , we can write the total noise - equivalent phonon number as    @xmath151",
    "the classical equation of motion for the optical cavity field @xmath132 is given in the frame rotating at the pump frequency by      where @xmath153 is the position of the acoustic resonator , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 is the optical input power at the device .",
    "in the regime of parametrically driven self - oscillation , the amplitude of the acoustic oscillator can become large enough that the usual linearization approximation becomes invalid .",
    "however , using the ansatz that the mechanical oscillation amplitude is given by @xmath156 ( note that @xmath157 is given in units of the zero - point amplitude , so that @xmath158 ) , an exact solution for the optical cavity field can be written as a sum of sidebands .                where @xmath166 .",
    "note that if we are only interested in the total energy in the cavity , @xmath167 , the final expansion of the global phase factor in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sideband_deriv ] is unnecessary and a simpler form for @xmath168 involving no sums may be used  @xcite .",
    "however , for the case considered here where a specific frequency component of the cavity output is filtered before detection it is necessary to use the full expression given in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sideband_expr ] . in the regime of self - oscillation",
    ", the oscillation amplitude @xmath157 is determined by balancing the optically induced mechanical gain with the intrinsic mechanical loss      the presence of the filters at the cavity output ensures that the spd count rate is proportional to the number of intracavity photons in the first stokes sideband at @xmath170 , which is given by @xmath171 . for the lowest input power , below threshold , @xmath172 is given by the simple linear approximation @xmath173/\\kappa$ ] , where @xmath48 is the thermal occupancy of the mechanical resonator . near and above threshold , @xmath172 can be determined from the ratio of the above and below threshold spd count rates and the known value of @xmath172 below threshold . for a given input power with",

    "this amplitude is small enough that the linear approximation ( @xmath178 ) is still valid . in particular , in the linear regime the relation @xmath179 should hold . for the largest value of @xmath180 in our measurements",
    ", we find that @xmath181 differs from @xmath182 by only about @xmath183 . the shift in detuning , and the concomitant reduction in oscillation amplitude , is expected due to the thermo - optic effect which will tend to shift the cavity resonance to lower frequencies as the total intracavity photon population is increased by the amplified stokes scattering  @xcite .",
