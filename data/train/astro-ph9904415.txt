    "observations of spatial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation are fundamental to our understanding of structure formation in the universe as they mark the earliest observable imprints of massive gravitational structures ( see e.g. review by white , scott & silk 1994 ) . the distribution and amplitude of anisotropies in the cmb sky over scales from degrees to arcminutes can be used to discriminate between competing cosmological theories . on scales of 0.2- 2",
    ", inflationary models predict that increased power should be seen in the cmb sky due to scattering of photons during acoustic oscillations of the photon - baryon fluid at recombination .",
    "detection and study of these acoustic or ` doppler ' peaks in the power spectrum is one of the primary goals of cmb astronomy .",
    "furthermore , the amplitudes and angular scales of the acoustic peaks provide powerful constraints on basic cosmological parameters including @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the first clear indication of a downturn in the power spectrum on sub - degree scales was provided by the detection of cmb power by the cambridge cosmic anisotropy telescope ( cat ) on scales of about half a degree ( scott et al .",
    "1996 ; paper i ) .",
    "the cat is a three - element interferometer operating at frequencies between 13 and 17  ghz ( robson et al .",
    "it is sensitive to structure on angular scales of about @xmath11 to @xmath12 over a field of view covering 2@xmath0  ( primary beam fwhm ) .",
    "this paper describes observations of a second field observed with cat and the detection of cmb anisotropies within it , at levels consistent with measurements in the first field .",
    "observations have been made with the cat of a blank field centred at the position 17  00  00 @xmath13  30  00 ( b1950 ) , which we call ` cat2 ' .",
    "the field was chosen to be relatively free from strong radio sources at frequencies up to 5  ghz ( condon , broderick & seielstad 1989 ) , lie at high galactic latitude ( @xmath14 ) and away from known galactic features ( e.g. the north polar spur ) .    in periods during the interval 1995 march  1997 june , cat observed the cat2 field at three frequencies , 13.5 , 15.5 and 16.5 ghz .",
    "the three baselines of the array were scaled with frequency to achieve the same resolution at each frequency .",
    "the resulting synthesised beams measured @xmath15 fwhm in right ascension and @xmath16 in declination .",
    "the primary beam of the telescope , due to the symmetric nearly - gaussian envelope beams of the three horn - reflector antennas , has a fwhm of 1.96  at 15.5  ghz , scaling inversely with frequency .",
    "the telescope observes in two orthogonal linear polarisations ( which rotate on the sky as it tracks ) , and has a system noise temperature of 50  k. an observing bandwidth of 500  mhz was used .",
    "amplitude and phase calibrations were carried out daily with observations of cas  a ( using the flux scale of baars et al .",
    "1977 ) , and cross checked periodically by observations of other 15-ghz calibrators from the vla list ( perley 1982 ) .",
    "typical uncertainties in flux scaling are less than 10% .",
    "observations were generally carried out at night ( about 80% of the data ) or pointing @xmath17 away from the sun to avoid possible solar interference ; no extra emission from the moon was detected at this declination .",
    "the cat2 data were reduced using the same method as for the first field , cat1 , as described in detail by osullivan et al .",
    "phase rotation and flux calibration were applied first , and the data were then edited and analysed using standard tasks in aips . excessively noisy data ( reflecting periods of poor weather ) were excised  the visibility amplitudes were all checked by eye for periods where they regularly exceeded the mean value by more than 3@xmath18 and then these data ( @xmath19 hour ) were removed from all baselines . across the remaining dataset , individual visibilities with amplitudes exceeding the 3@xmath18 threshold",
    "were also excluded . in total , about 40% of the data were excluded by this process leaving 370 , 310 and 1340 hours of good data at 13.5 , 15.5 and 16.5  ghz respectively .",
    "since the atmospheric coherence time is very short ( 10s ) compared with the total integration time , any remaining atmospheric signals will be distributed uniformly across the synthesised map as noise , unlike true sky signals which will be modulated by the envelope beam pattern .",
    "the efficacy of atmospheric filtering for the cat interferometer has already been demonstrated ( robson et al . 1994 ) .",
    "cat s sidelobe response and lack of crosstalk and correlator offsets are discussed in osullivan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . no radio interference was seen .",
    "radio sources contributing significantly to the cat2 image were identified and monitored at 15  ghz using the ryle telescope ( rt ) .",
    "five rt antennas were used in a configuration giving a synthesised beam of @xmath20 fwhm .",
    "the rt has an instantaneous field of view of @xmath21 fwhm , but for these observations is used in a rastering mode which covers @xmath22 in 12 hours to a typical flux sensitivity of 1.5  mjy / beam . to detect sources within the the cat2 field ,",
    "the central 2@xmath0  area was scanned with the rt in raster mode in sixteen days . a source list",
    "was then compiled , including sources listed in the green bank 4.85-ghz survey ( condon et al .",
    "1989 ) . pointed observations with the rt were then made , and repeated regularly to check for variability over the whole period of the cat observations . in all , twenty - nine sources were detected , the faintest having a flux density of 4.5  mjy at 15  ghz .",
    "flux densities at 13.5 and 16.5  ghz were extrapolated using spectral information obtained from lower frequency surveys ( i.e. 4.85  ghz , condon et al .",
    "1989 , and 1.4  ghz , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) where available .",
    "a flat spectrum between 13.5 and 16.5  ghz was assumed for three sources without other data . after correcting for cat primary beam attenuation ,",
    "the corresponding flux densities were subtracted as point sources from the visibility data .",
    "totals of 33mjy at 13.5 , 27mjy at 15.5 and 20mjy at 16.5 ghz were subtracted .",
    "the robustness of the source - subtraction procedure is illustrated in osullivan et al .",
    "the strongest source in the field , at position 16  45  32  + 63  35  29 ( b1950 ) , was highly variable ( by factors of up to two over periods of a few days ) and so was monitored regularly with the rt ; no residuals at the source position remain after subtraction of the variable source .",
    "the successful subtraction of this source , 1away from the pointing centre and clearly visible at the same position in all three maps , shows that cat phase calibration and pointing are accurate .",
    "the resulting source - subtracted images each show excess signal in the central 2@xmath0 falling away at larger radii as expected from the antenna envelope beam .",
    "these are displayed in figure [ cat2ss ] .",
    "the instrumental noise levels ( measured directly from the visibilities ) for each source - subtracted image are 6.1 , 6.5 and 3.5 mjy / beam rms for 13.5 , 15.5 and 16.5 ghz respectively . at the three frequencies , excess powers above the intrinsic noise level in the central 2@xmath0  area of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "mjy / beam rms were found for the source - subtracted 13.5 , 15.5 and 16.5  ghz images respectively .",
    "checks were made by splitting the data in time ( consistent excesses were seen ) , polarisation ( no excess power was visible on polarisation difference maps ) and cross - correlating the source - subtracted image with a reconstructed map of the radio sources as in osullivan et al .",
    "( no correlation was found ) ; most importantly , maps were made by correlating orthogonal polarisations and these gave the _",
    "same _ noise levels as those above .    to attempt to remove the instrumental response and thereby illustrate the distribution of features on the sky",
    ", we have co - added the data from the three frequencies weighted as @xmath26 and cleaned the final image .",
    "this is shown in figure [ cat2cln ] and shows the presence of significant features in the central region as well as the diminution of the telescope sensitivity in accordance with the envelope beam .",
    "the strongest feature in the cat2 images is a negative one centred at position 17  05  29  + 64  47  37 ( b1950 ) reaching @xmath27 mjy at 16.5 ghz ( i.e. 5@xmath18 , relative to the rms excess power in the sky ) . for comparison ,",
    "the strongest positive feature in the 16.5-ghz dirty map has a peak flux density of 26 mjy at position 16  55  55 + 63  49  47 ( b1950 ) .",
    "the negative feature can be seen at all three frequencies ( most clearly in the 13.5 and 16.5-ghz images in figure [ cat2ss ] ) , both before and after source subtraction and in different time cuts , and its spectrum is consistent with that of cmb radiation .",
    "for example , even before source subtraction the hole reaches @xmath28 mjy in the 16.5-ghz image , and only three weak sources ( @xmath29 mjy ) lie within @xmath30 of it .",
    "no obvious galactic structures at the position of the negative feature were visible in iras 100@xmath31 m ( wheelock et al . 1994 ) or hi 21-cm sky survey images ( lockman & dickey 1995 ) or the @xmath32 m map of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 .",
    "indeed , there is no resemblance at all between any of these images of the cat2 region and the cat2 image itself .    on the scales sampled by cat ,",
    "the negative feature is unlikely to have been caused by a sunyaev - zeldovich ( s  z ) effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ; rephaeli 1995 ) towards a single massive cluster .",
    "any cluster which might produce such an effect would have to be nearby ( subtending a large angle on the sky , filling the cat beam ) and/or very massive to produce such a strong signature . the strongest s  z decrements measured towards nearby clusters at 15  ghz with the rt ( grainge et al .",
    "1996 ; jones et al .",
    "1993 ) are about @xmath33mjy on arcminute scales .",
    "observing a similar cluster at @xmath34 ( e.g. gas mass @xmath35 , with a king profile of core radius @xmath36 kpc , truncated at about ten core radii ) with the larger cat beam of @xmath12 would produce a similar decrement amplitude , due to the balance between the effects of beam dilution and sampling cluster gas out to a larger radius . in order to maximise the s  z signal in a @xmath12 beam with the minimum gas mass , a nearby cluster ( @xmath37 ) with @xmath38 of gas",
    "would be required , which is patently not observed . a system at any higher redshift would require an even higher mass because of beam dilution .",
    "a central portion of the cat2 field has been observed serendipitously with rosat .",
    "the direction of the negative cmb feature lies close to the edge of the pspc field ( @xmath39 off axis ) and is partially shadowed by the support structure of the pspc detector .",
    "an x - ray source ( heavily distorted by the pspc point spread function ) is found nearby ( at the position 17  05  49 + 64  45  50 , b1950 ) but its x - ray spectrum does not fit a thermal model for any reasonable temperature , and is fit much better by a power law , implying it is not a cluster ( but perhaps an agn or galactic source ) .",
    "four clusters ( abell 2246 and two others at @xmath40 plus one at @xmath41 )  and an optically luminous qso ( hs  1700 + 6416 )  have been detected by rosat and lie within the central @xmath11 of the cat2 field ( reimers et al .",
    "1997 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "all four clusters are fainter than @xmath42 ergs@xmath43 at x - ray energies 0.42.0 kev and none is apparent in the cat images .",
    "finally , we emphasise that the presence of a 5@xmath18 feature in a single cat field should not be construed as evidence for non - gaussianity of the cmb fluctuations : the sidelobe structure of the synthesised beam of the three - element cat is significant , and analysis should be carried out in the aperture plane  see section [ analysis ] . as a check , we have simulated cat images given standard cdm - based realisations of cmb structure ( using the actual cmb and galactic mean power measured by cat ) , and find that features which appear as strong as @xmath44 occur in about 10% of cases .",
    "we return to this point in section [ analysis ] .",
    "due to the limited range of baselines and resulting sparse sampling of the @xmath45 plane by cat , a statistical likelihood analysis was employed to estimate the relative contributions of cmb and galactic components given the three - frequency cat data .",
    "a bayesian likelihood method was used , as in paper i , as described by hobson , lasenby & jones ( 1995 ) .",
    "this method uses the complex visibility data directly in the calculation of the likelihood function to avoid the problem of the long - range correlations present between different resolution elements in the image plane .",
    "as described in paper i , power was estimated in two independent annular bins centred on spherical harmonic multipole values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 and with widths equivalent to the diameter of the antenna function , thus together spanning the range @xmath48 .",
    "the noise - weighted centroid positions for data in each bin are @xmath49 and @xmath5 .",
    "cmb and galactic signals were modelled as independent gaussian distributions with a power - law spectrum ( @xmath50 ) , the cmb with a fixed spectral index of @xmath51 in flux density and the galactic spectral index variable between 0 and @xmath52 ( as expected for galactic free - free and synchrotron emission ) .",
    "after marginalising over the galactic parameters , this analysis confirmed that the bulk of the power in the 16.5  ghz map ( fig .",
    "[ cat2ss ] ) arises from cmb fluctuations .",
    "the cmb component was clearly distinguished from possible galactic contamination in the @xmath49 bin ; @xmath53 was estimated for the cmb signal , compared with only @xmath54 for any galactic component .",
    "the uncertainties quoted are @xmath8 values .",
    "the cmb  galaxy separation was less certain in the @xmath5 bin  a galactic contribution of @xmath55 was given by the likelihood analysis , which is equivalent to an upper limit for the marginalised cmb power of @xmath56 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "these values are plotted in figure [ deltat ] .",
    "the average values of @xmath57 in the cat2 field agree with the cat1 result ( paper i ) within @xmath8 ; for comparison the measured cmb powers in the cat1 field were @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we have also investigated how much of the cmb power is not associated with the strong negative feature discussed in section 4 .",
    "we removed the dip as a point source from the visibilities and repeated the above analysis .",
    "significant power remained , at around half of the level with the negative feature included .",
    "the cat2 points , taken in conjunction with the results from the saskatoon experiment @xcite , provide further evidence for a downturn in the cmb power spectrum for @xmath62 . to assess the implications for cosmological parameters using current cmb data sets , we have extended the analysis presented previously by hancock et al .",
    "this analysis used a statistically independent subset of the current data and carried out @xmath63 fitting for a range of cosmological models and parameters .",
    "the extensions carried out for the present work were ( a ) the inclusion of the cat2 point at @xmath64 ; ( b ) the inclusion of new points from experiments python ( python iii , platt et al .",

    "( see also rocha 1997 ; rocha et al .  in preparation ) .",

    "open models with @xmath65 and open - bubble inflation spectrum @xcite .    in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , nucleosynthesis constraints , with @xmath68 @xcite were assumed .",
    "theoretical power spectra from seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) were used in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , and kindly provided by n. sugiyama for case ( iii ) . the parameters fitted for ( unless fixed ) were the hubble constant @xmath69 ( in units of @xmath70 ) , the spectral tilt @xmath71 , the cosmological constant @xmath72 and the matter density @xmath73 in units of the critical density .",

[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     in common with other recent work on fitting to current cmb data ( e.g. lineweaver & barbosa 1998 ) a tendency to low @xmath9 values ( except in the case of open models ) is found , although it is clear from the marginalised ranges that the statistical significance of this is not yet high .",
    "for comparison with the results of webster et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who worked jointly with recent cmb and iras large - scale structure results , we note that a flat @xmath79 model with normalization fixed to the cobe results and @xmath80 yielded a best fit of @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in conjunction with the cat points , new results forthcoming from the python , viper and qmap to @xmath83",
    "consistent with the saskatoon results ( de oliviera costa et al .",

    "recent ovro results at @xmath84 ( leitch , private communication ) agree well with the values found by cat .",
    "the joint cat and ovro results will clearly be very significant in constraining the latest cosmic string power spectrum predictions , which now include a cosmological constant ( battye et al .",
    "these predictions succeed in recovering a significant ` doppler peak ' in the power spectrum , but have peak power for @xmath85 in the range 500 to 600 , at variance with the trend of the current experimental results .",
    "* we have imaged a 2@xmath0  patch of sky at 13 - 17 ghz with the cat ; this is the second field observed by cat . *",
    "significant cmb anisotropy is detected in the cat2 field with an average power of @xmath53 for the @xmath49 bin , and with an upper limit of @xmath56 for @xmath5 ( due to galactic contamination ) . *",
    "this new result is consistent with the first detection made by cat in a different area of sky . * together with other cmb data over a range of angular scales , the inclusion of the new cat2 detection restricts the likely values of cosmological parameters .",
