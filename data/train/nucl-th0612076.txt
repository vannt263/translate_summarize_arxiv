    "measurements of low relative - velocity correlations yield access to the size and shape of relative emission sources in reactions with multiparticle final states @xcite .",
    "this information plays an especially important role in in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the duration of emission , which is linked to the nuclear equation of state , can be also inferred from those measurements . perhaps the most startling",
    "finding , during the first years of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) program , was the disagreement between the features of experimentally determined emission sources @xcite and predictions of hydrodynamic models @xcite incorporating an anticipated phase transition , which would yield a long emission duration .",
    "a long emission duration would have resulted in an elongated shape ( @xmath0 in the usual rhic nomenclature ) of the emission source for particles of a specific momentum . in the literature",
    ", the most exhaustively studied correlation has been that produced by interference for identical mesons .",
    "for pure interference , the correlation expressed as a function of the relative particle momentum is related to the relative emission source through a simple fourier transformation , principally yielding direct access to the source shape . in the measured charged - meson correlations , the coulomb effects competing with interference had been normally compensated for with cumbersome corrections .",
    "however , as we demonstrate , the correlations induced by the coulomb and further by the strong interactions can also provide information on the source shapes .",
    "for any type of correlation , the analysis is facilitated by the use of spherical harmonics , either the standard complex tesseral harmonics or the real cartesian harmonics @xcite .",
    "the harmonics allow for a straightforward faithful representation of the three - dimensional correlation data , and also better facilitate isolating and focusing on specific physical properties of the source .",
    "different source parameterizations will be employed for illustration of our discussions .",
    "for example , the @xmath1 harmonic expansion coefficients , characterizing quadrupole deformation , provide information on the ratio of radii @xmath2 in the common gaussian source representation .",
    "the correlation , associated with the final - state effects at low relative velocities within a subsystem of the particles @xmath3 and @xmath4 , can be linked to a source function @xmath5 through the relation : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the deviation of the l.h.s.correlation function from unity , @xmath8 is the total momentum of the pair and @xmath9 is the relative momentum measured in the two - particle rest frame .",
    "the factor @xmath10 represents the relative wavefunction squared , in the two - particle rest frame , with asymptotic condition imposed on the outgoing wave .",
    "the square of the wavefunction is averaged over spins .",
    "the function @xmath11 represents the probability density that the particles @xmath3 and @xmath4 , moving with the same velocity @xmath12 corresponding to the total momentum @xmath8 , are emitted from the reacting system a distance @xmath13 apart in their rest frame .",
    "since at large @xmath9 , the emission in multiparticle final states becomes uncorrelated , i.e.  @xmath14 while @xmath10 averages to 1 as a function of @xmath13 , it follows that @xmath5 is normalized to 1 , @xmath15 . a detailed derivation of eq.([eq : corrmaster ] ) can be found in @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the probability density of emission at the relative distance may be expressed in terms of single - particle probability densities @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the density for emitting particles of type @xmath3 with momentum @xmath19 from space - time point @xmath20 .",
    "the spatial arguments are for the frame moving at the center - of - mass velocity @xmath12 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrmaster ] ) , the correlation data access the probability distribution in the relative rest - frame separation only . information on emission duration can only be inferred from the influence of that duration on the relative spatial distribution @xcite .",
    "similarly , single - particle distributions @xmath16 can be deduced only indirectly from data ( [ eq : corrmaster ] ) because of the folding in ( [ eq : sss ] ) with an integration over the average particle position . for a set of investigated particles , the constraining of single - particle distributions",
    "may be enhanced by an analysis of correlations ( [ eq : corrmaster ] ) of all possible particle pairs .    in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on what might be directly determined from data , i.e. , the determination of @xmath11 given measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "since each individual value of @xmath8 nominally represents a different problem , we suppress the @xmath21 arguments in the functions . as access to @xmath5",
    "is conditioned on any deviations of @xmath22 from unity , we subtract unity from both sides of ( [ eq : corrmaster ] ) arriving at @xmath23 { \\mathcal s}({\\pmb r } ) \\equiv \\int { \\rm d}^3r \\ , { \\mathcal k } ( { \\pmb q},{\\pmb r } ) \\ , { \\mathcal s}({\\pmb r } )   \\ , , \\ ] ] where we have utilized the normalization of @xmath11 . here ,",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath13 are evaluated in a frame where @xmath24 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath25 is related to @xmath5 through an integral transform where @xmath26 plays the role of the kernel @xmath27 of transformation .",
    "the determination of @xmath28 from @xmath29 amounts then to the inversion of the integral transform , often referred to as imaging @xcite .",
    "imaging has already been extensively performed for angle - averaged correlation functions , @xmath30 , which can provide angle - averaged distributions @xmath31 .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to describe how one might extract the angular information in @xmath28 by decomposing @xmath29 in terms of surface - spherical tesseral and cartesian harmonics .",
    "a  parallel effort , employing tesseral harmonics in the case of pure interference , is described in @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction squared @xmath32 depends , after summation over spins , only on the magnitudes of @xmath33 and @xmath34 and on the angle @xmath35 between @xmath9 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the square is invariant under rotations . as a consequence , the coefficients of expansion in terms of spherical harmonics , for the correlation and source functions ,",
    "are directly related to each other  @xcite , @xmath36 here , the expansion coefficients and expansion for the correlation function are defined by the relations : @xmath37 with analogous expressions for the source function .",
    "the partial kernel @xmath38 encodes the information from the wavefunction , @xmath39 coefficient of the correlation function is tied to the coefficient of the source function with the same @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the source restoration can be reduced to a series of one - dimensional inversions of the integral transformations for individual @xmath40 , employing kernels for specific @xmath41 .",
    "this sequence of one - dimensional inversions is computationally simpler than a single three - dimensional inversion .",
    "the angular resolution of data would determine how far the restoration can proceed in @xmath41 .",
    "one problem with the above is the emergence of complex coefficients for the real - valued correlation and source functions , lacking direct geometric interpretation .",
    "the last issue is circumvented by introducing an alternate real - valued basis in the space of spherical angles , surface - spherical cartesian harmonics @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "cartesian harmonics @xmath43 are linear combinations of @xmath44 with different @xmath45 but the same @xmath46 . in terms of the directional unit vector @xmath47 pointing in the @xmath48 direction , the cartesian harmonics are explicitly given by @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "just the existence of the cartesian harmonics and their properties justify representing a function of the spherical angle in the second series in ( [ eq : cartesianmaster_exp ] ) .    since @xmath43 is a combination of @xmath44 with @xmath56 , the coefficients of expansion in terms of cartesian harmonics for the source and correlation function are related to each other in the same way as the coefficients of expansion in terms of tesseral harmonics in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ylmmaster ] ) , @xmath57    in the next section , the structure of the kernel @xmath38 in eqs.([eq : ylmmaster ] ) and ( [ eq : cartesianmaster ] ) is investigated for the cases of pure identical - particle interference and for strong and coulomb interactions within a pair .",
    "we find that all three classes of final - state effects provide significant resolving power for different @xmath41 .",
    "section [ sec : cartesian ] provides a detailed discussion of the properties of cartesian harmonics .",
    "the subsequent section presents a discussion of the utility of higher @xmath41-moments and their relation to specific geometric features of the source .",
    "in particular , we show that the @xmath58 moments can reveal an offset between the probability clouds for two different species , that the @xmath1 moments can reveal the magnitude and orientation of axes in the ellipsoidal approximation for a source , while the @xmath59 moments can reveal the `` boomerang '' nature of a source . in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] , the cases of gaussian and blast wave sources are studied , as examples , in quantitative detail . in the final section ,",

    "data on @xmath25 are obtained at a certain resolution in @xmath33 and suffer from errors . the theoretical relation ( [ eq : corrmaster ] )",
    "involves approximations  @xcite , in assuming that the relative momentum @xmath33 is small compared to the scales characterizing the rest of the system and in ignoring final - state effects other than those between the two studied particles moving slow relative to each other .",
    "if the kernels @xmath38 drop rapidly as @xmath41 increases , for typical @xmath33-values and for values of @xmath34 characteristic to the source function , there will be no chance to determine details of the shape of @xmath28 . in the following",
    "we analyze the situation for different types of final - state interactions at different @xmath41 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    in the process of source restoration , the values of @xmath61",
    "would be known at discrete values of @xmath33 . in parallel ,",
    "the source @xmath62 might be discretized in @xmath34 or decomposed in some basis .",
    "the source restoration would then amount to the inversion of a matrix out of @xmath60 , cf .",
    "an inability to extract source features might be signalled by the proximity of matrix eigenvalues to zero , resulting in an instability of the inversion .",
    "such a situation could be encountered when extracting details of @xmath63 in an @xmath34-region where @xmath38 lacks resolving power .",
    "practical experience in matrix - inversion strategy , in analyzing data , has been gained for @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "importantly , this strategy has revealed non - gaussian features in @xmath65 , which were especially significant for proton sources in intermediate energy collisions .",
    "more common in the literature than the source discretization , has been a parameterization of the source which is then fit to @xmath25 .",
    "when parameterizing the source in three - dimensions , the benefit regarding angular moments can be in understanding a  systematic of the moments , @xmath66 and @xmath63 , as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "with regard to the fit strategy , the features of @xmath60 determine what parameters of @xmath5 may be potentially constrained by data .    in the first subsection",
    "we discuss kernels for the case of pure identity interference between spin-0 bosons .",
    "the two subsequent subsections are dedicated to the coulomb and the strong interactions . before launching into a detailed discussion of specific classes of interactions",
    ", we emphasize a general observation that a three - dimensional source @xmath68 , expanded in a taylor series around @xmath69 , behaves as @xmath70 for small @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , there is not much to be discerned about the source at small @xmath34 for @xmath71 , particularly for large @xmath41 , and the structure of @xmath72 at small @xmath34 will not be overly important .",
    "on the other hand , much could be learned about the angular structure of the source at large @xmath34 .",
    "however , when the large-@xmath34 region gets mapped onto small @xmath33 , the ability to gain angular information becomes limited by the experimental resolution capabilities .",
    "thus , in practice , the most important features of @xmath73 are those at moderate @xmath33 combined with moderate to high @xmath34 .",
    "the naive expectation regarding strong interactions may be that when an @xmath16-wave dominates the interaction , there is no possibility to discern source shapes .",

    "a few points need to be kept in mind . in an infinite system with a hubble - like expansion along the longitudinal direction , the associated relative source should fall off exponentially at large @xmath34 in the longitudinal direction , rather than falling in a gaussian fashion , see e.g.  eq .",

    "these tendencies are to an extent associated with the source tails .",
    "since the emission region region is wider in the case of pions than kaons , the larger - scale geometry of the emitting region is explored more stringently in the case of pions .",
    "in addition , the pions become relativistic at lower @xmath469 than do kaons . the finite transverse extension of the emission zone most strongly suppresses the tail of the relative source in the negative @xmath20-direction . in terms of angular coefficients",

    "further sign changes are seen for the blast - wave @xmath59 coefficients , while there are no such changes for the corresponding gaussian coefficients .",
    "these sign changes reflect the more complex nature of the blast - wave sources of a crescent - like shape in the @xmath458 and @xmath471 directions .",
    "the latter shape results from the relativistically noninstantaneous nature of the boost - invariant blast - wave emission , mentioned already in the preceding section .",

    "particularly well suited for investigating the high-@xmath41 correlations should be the high - statistics data from the 2004 run at rhic .",
    "eventually , the reach of the analysis may be limited by systematics rather than by statistics .",
    "correlation measurements are a crucial tool for understanding the dynamics of central nuclear reactions .",
    "one of the forefront tasks before the correlation analysis is to decipher the mire of rhic data . without carrying out a multidimensional correlation analysis ,",
    "there is little chance for a detailed understanding of the impact of dynamics on correlations in those reactions and for understanding of the role played by the equation of state . to date ,",
    "correlation analyses at rhic have focused on identical pions . in identical - pion correlations ,",
    "strong interactions play little role . in the analyses to date , coulomb interactions have been normally corrected for in a shape - independent manner , leaving off correlations induced by identical - particle interference .",
    "the latter are related to the source through fourier transformation allowing for easy modelling with specific sources such as gaussian .",
    "the decomposition of correlations in terms of cartesian coefficients offers an alternative way of carrying out a multidimensional correlation analysis for identical pion pairs and it provides possibility for carrying out multidimensional analysis for other classes of final - state effects .",
    "one of the benefits of decomposing information with angular harmonics is that the correlations induced by coulomb and strong interactions carry , on their own , some shape information that can be exploited in the correlation analysis .",
    "the representation of the correlations in terms of the cartesian or tesseral coefficients carries the full three - dimensional information in terms of a set of one - dimensional functions .",
    "data represented in this fashion can be then be compared to models visually , one harmonic at a time , providing the means to better identify which shape characteristics of the data are being described by the model .",
    "the ability to discern information about source shapes from correlation measurements depends on the structure of the kernels , @xmath478 , for different spherical ranks  @xmath41 . in section [ sec : kernels ] , it was demonstrated that the identical - particle interference , coulomb and strong interactions all produce effective kernels .",
    "the resolving power of coulomb interactions was shown to rise with mass and charge within the interacting pair .",
    "strong interactions are most effective in the resonance region and , otherwise , for large cross sections .",
    "even purely @xmath16 wave interactions can produce kernels of good resolving power at higher @xmath41 .",
    "while expansions employing tesseral harmonics nominally provide as powerful means for storing information in correlation functions as cartesian harmonics , they do not provide as transparent or as intuitive means for understanding the shapes as expansions done using the cartesian harmonic basis .",
    "cartesian harmonics have a variety of useful properties which can be exploited in manipulating the angular information as was shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : cartesian ] .",

    "detailed examples of sources and correlations have been presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] .",
    "using gaussian sources , it has been , in particular , demonstrated that the @xmath482 and @xmath364 correlations can realistically be expected to provide shape information on emission sources . the strengths of correlations characterizing shape anisotropies can reach the magnitude of few percent . while the upcoming rhic data sets will provide sufficient statistics to assess correlations between different particles at the level of one percent or better",
    ", the true challenge may turn out to the subtraction of competing correlations , such as those produced by jets .",
    "the proton - charged meson correlations are dominated by coulomb interactions .",
    "the strong interactions in baryon - baryon systems can also , though , provide good means for discerning shape anisotropies at low relative momenta , yielding correlations of the same order or larger than the proton - meson correlations .",
    "one common feature of all pairs and sources examined here is that the variation of the correlation with angle is comparable in magnitude to the angle - integrated correlation .",
    "consequently , if one has sufficient statistics to measure a one - dimensional correlation , only a modest enhancement in statistics would suffice to find , or constrain in a meaningful manner , the higher angular moments . in the context of the blast - wave sources , opportunities for detecting more complex shapes",
    "have been discussed , such as boomerang shapes .    in conclusion ,",
    "a treasure trove of potential information lies largely ignored in the huge volumes of data from high - energy collisions .",
    "this information can address what is the perhaps the greatest surprise of the first several years of rhic experiments , the source sizes and shapes inferred from identical - pion correlations .",
    "the main difficulty with the proposed new class of correlation analyses is the fact that they rely on observables that are quantitatively small , of the order of a percent .",
    "this will require a careful analysis of competing correlations from jets and collective flow , but we believe that the objectives will indeed prove feasible .",
    "in arriving at the cartesian harmonics , an important role has been played by the cartesian projection operator @xmath266 which projects out the symmetric traceless portion of any cartesian tensor . as a projection operator ,",
