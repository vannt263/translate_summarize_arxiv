    "@xcite . compared to the potential used in that work ,",
    "our rabi frequency is much smaller and our detuning much closer to zero , and we have confirmed that the shift changes sign for larger @xmath150 and large negative detunings .",
    "as noted in the main text , we shift the data by a fixed detuning for display in fig .  3 .",
    "despite the discrepancy between the calculated and measured values of the detuning , the data matches the gpe in terms of the shape of the curves and the slope of the population oscillation frequency as a function of @xmath151 . for this reason",
    ", we are satisfied that the shift we are applying is acting to account for an unknown systematic uncertainty in the determination of the trap bottom value @xmath152 .    after taking into account all known systematic shifts , which include the beyond - rwa effect described above and calibrations in measuring the trap bottom @xmath152 , we fit the experimental data to the gpe simulation data using a single - parameter least - squares fit , where the fitting parameter acts to slide the data along the detuning axis .",
    "we find that a shift of @xmath153  khz accounts for the difference between the experiment and the gpe .",
    "this shift is in the opposite direction to the beyond - rwa corrections .",
    "possible sources of this discrepancy include systematic errors in determining the static trap bottom @xmath152 , or imperfections in the polarization of @xmath154 due to the proximity of the fields to the chip and its copper support .",
    "to calibrate the atom number , we use standard absorption imaging to measure the thermal fraction of clouds above and below the condensate temperature .",
    "we determine the total atom number by measuring the total absorption of the cloud , and the thermal number by fitting the wings to a bose - einstein distribution and integrating under the entire curve to extract thermal atom number .",
    "the temperature of each condensate is determined by fitting the wings to a gaussian .    to find @xmath155 , the condensation temperature , we plot the condensate fraction as a function of temperature .",
    "we determine the temperature at which the condensate fraction is first non - zero , and find the number of atoms to which this corresponds . using the relationship between condensation temperature and atom number , including finite size and interaction effects [ s1 ] , we can determine the condensation temperature to @xmath389% ( @xmath156  nk ) . propagating this error through to atom number",
    ", we arrive at a calibration factor @xmath157 , which accounts for the systematic uncertainty in our atom number , @xmath158 .    the number , @xmath159 was chosen for the calculations because this is the number within the systematic uncertainty for which the best agreement is found for mode amplitudes ( fig .",
    "the same @xmath159 is used in the josephson model and hydrodynamic approximations .",
    "to analyze the time series data , as in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we use a fourier transform ( ft ) . to prepare the data , we eliminate the offset from @xmath160 components by subtracting from each point the mean , where the mean might be non - zero due to a small equilibrium imbalance in the system .",
    "we smooth the transformed data by padding the time series with zeros to a total of 1024 points .",
    "when extracting the peak locations from the ft , we eliminate the points below the frequency given by @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the longest hold time .",
    "we then find the two peaks with the maximum height and use these are our data points in fig .",
    "we plot the amplitudes - squared of the fts in the color - map in fig .  3 behind the data .",
    "the data are linearly interpolated numerically between the values of @xmath116 ( @xmath41 ) at which the data were measured .",
    "the uncertainty in the frequency measurement is found by simulating data with the same level of noise as the original time series .",

    "the standard deviation of the residuals from this fit gives the noise level .",
    "we simulate data 100 times with the same parameters as those given by the fit , with the same total time and density of points , but with different randomized instances of gaussian noise whose standard deviation is the same as that measured .",
    "taking the frequency measurements from each of these trials , we determine the smallest range inside of which 68% of the measurements lie .",
    "this confidence interval is used as the uncertainty in the frequency measurement .",
    "the noise floor in the ft is established in a similar fashion . using the result for the noise level from the time series",
    ", we simulate pure gaussian noise and take the ft of this .",
    "the noise floor we show is the mean plus one standard deviation of the maximum peak amplitudes found in 100 such simulations .",
    "the amplitudes used in determining the ratio @xmath69 , shown in fig .  4 , are given by the values determined by the fit ( eq .  ( [ eq:2freq ] ) ) .",
    "the uncertainties in these values are determined in a similar way to those in the frequencies ; we use the noise level in the residuals of the fit , simulate and fit 100 sets of data with similar parameters , and use the 68% confidence interval of these results to represent our uncertainty .",
    "one significant difference between the calculated and measured quantities is that the calculated amplitudes display no decay .",

    "<S> when the barrier is raised from zero , the higher mode is at first more easily excited due to an increased anharmonicity along @xmath26 as the trap bottom becomes flatter . by further increasing the barrier </S>",
    "<S> , the higher - frequency mode disappears from the population oscillation spectrum due to the vanishing excitation of transverse modes . as the wavefunctions in each individual </S>",
    "<S> well are increasingly localized to the effectively harmonic minima , the linear bias no longer excites intrawell transverse motion . furthermore , in the linear perturbation regime , the interwell josephson plasma oscillation , like all bogoliubov modes , can not itself trigger any other collective mode .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the quantum transport of a bec in a double - well potential throughout the crossover from hydrodynamic to josephson regimes . </S>",
    "<S> apart from fundamental interest , knowing and controlling the nature of superfluid transport is crucial for technological applications of weak - link based devices , such as double - slit interferometers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the adiabatic transformation of a bec from a single- to a double - well trapping potential has been discussed in recent experimental works @xcite in the context of the josephson model , valid at high barriers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our work demonstrates that for @xmath70 , the lowest mode frequency will lie below that estimated by the josephson model . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the higher - lying mode we observe approaches the lowest collective mode as @xmath71 @xcite and may be important to the dynamics of splitting in strongly anisotropic double wells @xcite . whether using splitting to prepare entangled states @xcite , or recombination @xcite to perform closed - loop interferometry @xcite , an improved understanding of double - well dynamics provides a foundation for controlling mesoscopic superfluids .    </S>",
