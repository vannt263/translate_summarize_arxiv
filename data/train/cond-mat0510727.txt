    "the presence of quenched randomness leads to many differences in the statistical behavior if compared to `` pure systems '' .",
    "this is true in many phenomena as transport properties in , for instance , superconductors , or in a rather wide range of cases in magnetism .",
    "consider a domain wall in a magnet , which gets pinned due to impurities .",
    "the scenario may vary according to the symmetries of the system and to the character of the disorder , but is described , in most general terms , by an `` energy landscape '' which develops a rich structure due to the the presence of pinning defects @xcite .",
    "the most usual and convenient example of such magnets is given by the ising model -universality class .",
    "disorder is normally introduced as frozen random bond  and `` random field '' impurities , which can change dramatically the nature of the phases of the model and the character of the phase transition .",
    "strong enough bond disorder creates a spin glass -state , while the random fields couple directly to the order parameter , the magnetization .",
    "the criticality in such models is usually studied by finite size scaling , to extract the thermodynamic behavior . however ,",
    "real ( experimental ) systems are finite and have boundaries . these break the translational invariance and create differences in the critical behavior between the boundary region and the bulk .",
    "the related phenomenon is called `` surface criticality '' , and essential is that a whole set of new critical exponents arises , to describe the behavior of various quantities at and close to surfaces @xcite . here , we investigate by scaling arguments and exact numerical methods this phenomenon in the case of the random field ising model ( rfim ) , in three dimensions ( 3d ) . in this case , the rfim has a bulk phase transition separating ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states .",
    "the central question that we want to tackle is : how do disorder and the presence of boundaries combine , in a system where the critical bulk properties are already different from pure systems ?",
    "though disordered magnets have been investigated earlier for the case of weak bond - disorder @xcite , both spin - glasses - a possible future extension of our work - and the rfim have not been studied @xcite .",
    "one general problem of the 3d rfim has been how to observe the critical behavior , and understanding the boundary critical behavior provides an independent , novel avenue for such purposes @xcite .",
    "such experiments are done on a number of systems from diluted antiferromagnets in a field , @xcite , to binary liquids in porous media , @xcite , and to relaxor ferroelectrics @xcite .",
    "the particular characteristics of the rfim is a complicated energy landscape , which manifests itself e.g. in the violation of the usual hyperscaling relation of thermodynamics , and in the existence of an associated violation exponent @xmath3 and several consequences thereof .",
    "this is analogous to , for instance , spin glasses , and furthermore for surface criticality presents the question how the broken translational invariance combines with the energy scaling .",
    "our results imply that this can be understood by scalings that include both the bulk correlation length exponent @xmath4 and the bulk @xmath3 and novel surface exponents .",
    "moreover , though the bulk rfim 3d phase transition has been notoriously difficult experimentally , the boundary order parameter , say , should be quite sensitive to the control one ( temperature , in experiments and disorder here ) and promises thus to make the surface criticality experimentally observable .    in the next section we overview the theoretical picture , as applied to the rfim .",
    "section 3 presents the numerical results , where the emphasis is two - fold .",
    "we discuss the surface criticality on one hand , and on the other hand the decay of a surface field induced perturbation is analyzed , since it has characteristics peculiar to a disordered magnet , in contrast to pure systems . finally , section 4 finishes the paper with a discussion of the results and future prospects .",
    "the rfim hamiltonian with a free surface @xmath5 reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the bulk ( nearest neighbour ) interaction strength while @xmath8 describes the strength of the _ surface interaction _ , in general different from @xmath7 . @xmath9",

    "one might have also external fields such as a bulk magnetic field @xmath14 and a surface magnetic field @xmath15 at @xmath5 .",
    "being governed by a zero temperature fixed point , the phase transition of the 3d rfim can also be studied at @xmath16 , where it takes place at a critical @xmath17 .",
    "the transition is of second order though it also exhibits some first - order characteristics : the order parameter exponent @xmath18 is very close to zero @xcite .",
    "the surface criticality of the 3d rfim is simplified by the fact that the lower critical dimension is two @xcite , thus in the absence of a surface magnetic field @xmath15 just an _ ordinary transition _ can take place .",
    "the surface orders only because the bulk does so , and the transition point is the bulk critical point .    even in this case",
    ", there is a wide variaty of surface quantities .",

    "free boundary conditions are used in one direction ( the free surface under study ) while in the remaining ones periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the maximal statistical error in what follows is of the order of the symbol size used , so the error bars are omitted .",

    "in this work we have studied with combinatorial optimization and scaling arguments surface criticality in a random magnet , the 3d rfim . the surface layer magnetization exponent @xmath0 is more than an order of magnitude larger than the extremely small bulk value @xcite .",
    "experimentalists have reported much larger values for @xmath18 @xcite , which in fact are rather close to our estimate for @xmath0 .",

    "( [ pure_scaling ] ) . the numerically obtained description of the ordinary surface transition uses the bulk correlation length exponent as in pure systems .",
    "all this would merit further theoretical considerations and could also be checked in the four - dimensional rfim @xcite , whose phase diagram is also more complex due to the 3d surfaces which have independently phase transitions .",

    "it would be interesting to investigate this aspect in more detail , but in our numerics the most transparent features are due to the two - peaked magnetization distribution of the groundstates , without a perturbing field .    on a final note , the observations here concerning surface criticality in a disordered magnet - with a complicated energy landscape - extend directly for instance to spin glasses @xcite and to a wide class of non - equilibrium systems ( see @xcite , also for experimental suggestions ) .",
