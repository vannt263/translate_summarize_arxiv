    "in the field of finance , the efficient market hypothesis ( emh ) proposed by fama has had a great influence on theory and practice @xcite .",
    "the emh is based on whether newly generated information is instantaneously and sufficiently reflected in stock prices .",
    "based on the point of time of generation , information can be classified into three types : historical information , public information , and future ( or internal ) information .",
    "depending on the reflection of each information in stock prices , the emh can be divided into three types : weak - form emh of historical information , semi strong - form emh of public information and strong - form emh of future information .",
    "recent research in the field of econophysics examining properties and phenomena of financial time - series through interdisciplinary studies are mostly related to weak - form emh .",
    "the fact that weak - form emh is supported by financial time - series means that historical information such as similar price change patterns is not useful for predicting future price changes . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that weak - form emh is not supported means that similar price change patterns in the past have information values useful for predicting future price changes .    of the interdisciplinary studies in the fields of finance and econophysics , research on long - term memory properties",
    "have been of particular interest @xcite .",
    "many researchers are interested in this research topic because the results of the existence of long - term memory properties not only serves as negative evidence of weak - form emh but also is closely related to the predictability of stock prices .",
    "the hurst exponent has been widely used as a method to measure long - term memory properties @xcite .",
    "this measurement quantifies the degree of persistence of similar price change patterns , and it is closely related to weak - form emh .",
    "also , there are studies that have proposed that the hurst exponent could be used as an efficiency measurement of stock markets @xcite .    however , it is difficult to find studies that have empirically observed the relationship between the existence of long - term memory properties and the predictability of future prices . to investigate such research ,",
    "it is necessary to establish a prediction model which can examine the practical relationship with the hurst exponent , which represents a quantitative measurement of the degree of efficiency .",
    "such a prediction model should be based on the use of similar price change patterns , which are common components between weak - form emh and the hurst exponent .",
    "accordingly , we used the nearest - neighbor prediction ( nn ) method , which uses similar price change patterns of the past for the prediction of future price changes @xcite .",
    "this method first sets the past price changes of a specific time period from the previous date , @xmath0 , of a future trading date , @xmath1 , to be predicted as the target price change pattern .",
    "next , it selects a price change pattern of the past period similar to the target price change pattern .",
    "finally , in order to predict the price of the future trading date , it uses the price change information generated by following the date of the selected price change pattern of the past .",
    "this nn method is known to be useful for short - term prediction .",
    "accordingly , we empirically investigated the relationship between the predictability calculated from the nn method and the degree of efficiency calculated from the hurst exponent in financial time - series .",
    "the test hypothesis is that the relationship between the degree of efficiency and the predictability is positive .",
    "this is due to the fact that we do not support the weak - form emh , which means that similar price change patterns appear frequently in financial time - series .",
    "as the frequency of similar price change patterns increases , the hurst exponent has a higher value , @xmath2 .",
    "that is , as the degree of efficiency decreases , the hurst exponent will become greater .",
    "meanwhile , as the similarity of the price change patterns in financial time - series data increases , the predictability using similar price change patterns will increase .",
    "in other words , as the degree of efficiency decreases , the predictability increases . in sum , there will be a positive relationship between the degree of efficiency of the hurst exponent and the predictability of the nn method . in order to empirically investigate this hypothesis",
    ", we used 60 stock market indexes of various countries .",
    "we found that there is a strongly positive relationship between the degree of efficiency of the hurst exponent and the predictability of the nn method .",
    "that is , a market index with a lower degree of efficiency ( a higher hurst exponent ) has a higher level of predictability .",
    "these results were commonly observed regardless of data and period .",
    "in addition , we discovered that the degree of efficiency of the hurst exponent and the predictability of the nn method were useful as deterministic factors that can empirically distinguish emerging capital markets from mature capital markets .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the data and methods of the test procedures used in this paper . in section [ sec:3 ] , we present the results obtained according to our established research aims",
    ". finally , we summarize the findings and conclusions of the study .",
    "in this study , we used 60 representative stock market indexes of 56 countries ( from datastream ) .",

    "further , the return time series , @xmath3 , of the market index used in this paper was calculated by the logarithmic change of the price , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the stock price on day @xmath0 .      in order to quantify the degree of long - term memory property",
    ", we used the hurst exponent . in previous works ,",
    "the dfa method @xcite was the efficient method for accurately calculating the hurst exponent @xcite .",
    "therefore , we used the hurst exponent calculated by the dfa method as a measurement to quantify the degree of efficiency in a financial time series . the hurst exponent calculated by the dfa method",
    "can be explained by the following steps .",
    "first , after the subtraction of the mean , @xmath6 , from the original time series , @xmath7 , one accumulates the series , @xmath8 , as defined by    @xmath9 , \\label{eq:1a}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the number of the time series .",

    "we estimated the trend lines , @xmath12 , by using the ordinary least square ( ols ) in each window .",
    "we eliminated trends existing within the window by subtracting from the accumulated time series in each window .",
    "this process was applied to every window and the fluctuation magnitude , @xmath13 , was defined as    @xmath14 ^ 2}. \\label{eq:1b}\\ ] ]    the process mentioned above was repeated for every scale , @xmath11 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , we investigated whether the scaling relationship exists for every scale .",
    "that is , the scaling relationship is defined by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the constant and @xmath21 is the hurst exponent .",
    "based on @xmath22 , if @xmath23 , the time series will have a short - term memory .",
    "if @xmath24 , it will have a long - term memory .",
    "we used the hurst exponent as the measurement of the degree of efficiency of a stock market in each country .",
    "that is , as the hurst exponent increases , the persistence of similar patterns in past price changes is high .",
    "that means that the pattern of past price changes is useful information when predicting future price change .",
    "in addition , in order to estimate and use the robust hurst exponent regardless of the time variation , we used the average hurst exponent , @xmath25 .",
    "this was estimated repeatedly until june 2006 , @xmath26 , by estimating a period of 60 months and rolling 12 months for a whole period until june 2007 , @xmath27 .",
    "the reason why we omitted the data from july 2006 to june 2007 when calculating the mean hurst exponent is that we needed an out - of - sample of the 12 months prediction period not included in the estimated period of the nn method .      in order to investigate the relationship between degree of efficiency of the hurst exponent and predictability of future price change",
    ", we used the hit rate calculated by the nn method .",
    "the process of the nn method can be expressed as follows . in the first step , we reconstructed the pattern series , @xmath28 , with the embedding dimension , @xmath29 , and the time delay , @xmath30 , from the financial time series , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath17 , @xmath33 , and defined as    @xmath34,\\\\ n=(m-1)\\tau + 1 , \\ldots , t. \\label{2a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , the structure of the reconstructed time series can be explained as follows .",
    "the length of the reconstructed pattern series , @xmath28 , is @xmath29 in a time series of @xmath10 length , and this creates the @xmath35 data points . in order to predict price change at time @xmath1",
    ", we have to find price change patterns similar to the target price change pattern @xmath36 at time @xmath0 among a @xmath35 past price pattern series @xmath37 . the criteria to select the similar patterns in the price change",
    "is the distance between both vectors ,    @xmath38    that is , if the distance is 0 , both price change patterns are completely identical .",
    "as the distance increases , it will not have a similar pattern of price change .",
    "we chose the @xmath39 number of similar pattern , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , which has the smallest distance , among the whole pattern series . to confirm",
    "whether the chosen similar patterns of past price changes are true , we selected the chosen similar patterns , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , for the embedding dimension,@xmath44 .",
    "the future price change , @xmath45 , can be predicted by the next price change , @xmath46 , of the chosen patterns of the price change , @xmath47 , and defined as    @xmath48    we calculated the hit rate by using the degree of consistence as the prediction power by comparing the direction of actual price change with the direction of predicted price change . in order to employ the instinctive method in the estimation of prediction power",
    ", we determined the direction by comparing it to the frequency of direction of past price change patterns .",
    "that is , the direction of future price , @xmath45 , is determined by the direction having a higher frequency using the number of direction frequency .",
    "in addition , this depends on whether the next day price change of the chosen past patterns in the equation [ eq:2c ] is in an upward direction or downward direction .",
    "we used the same period described above to calculate the hurst exponent .",
    "that is , the period to reconstruct is 60 months .",
    "the prediction period is 12 months of out - of - sample , not including the reconstruction period . as in previous studies ,",
    "the prediction day is one day . that is , using the first reconstruction period , @xmath49 , we predicted the direction ( up or down ) of price change for the first trading day , @xmath50 , for the prediction period ( 12 months ) .",
    "next , we valuated the consistency between actual price change and that estimated by the nn model .",
    "to predict the direction of price change on the second trading day , @xmath51 , we used the pattern series by removing the farthest trading day ( 1 day ) and including the new trading day ( 1 day ) .",
    "this process was repeated for the prediction period ( 12 months , @xmath52 ) .",
    "after the prediction period closes , the prediction power can be calculated by the frequency ratio , @xmath53/fq_t[t_p]$ ] , of the number of consistent direction trading , @xmath54 , with the number of trading day , @xmath55 , for the prediction period .",
    "next , according to the above process after the moving period ( 12 months ) as the process for the hurst exponent , we calculated the hit - rate @xmath56 of future price change using the second reconstruction period , @xmath57 .",
    "this process was repeated until the reconstruction period , @xmath26 , of the last day of the prediction period .",
    "we used the average hit - rates , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , in terms of the consistent direction between actual price changes and those estimated by the nn model as the prediction power in order to observe the relationship with the degree of efficiency of the hurst exponent .",
    "the purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between the degree of efficiency and the predictability in financial time - series data ; that is , the test hypothesis is whether the relationship between the degree of efficiency and the predictability is positive .",
    "the hurst exponent was used as the measurement of the degree of efficiency and the nn method was used for the prediction of the directions of future price changes .",
