    "nevertheless , detections remain rare with only 77  21-cm absorption systems known at @xmath4  35 _ associated _ with the quasar host galaxy ( @xmath5 ) , in addition to 42 systems located at some intermediate redshift along the sight - line to the quasar ( @xmath6 ) .",

    "the velocity integrated optical depth of the 21-cm absorption , @xmath8 , is related to the total neutral hydrogen column density via @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 [ k ] is the mean harmonic spin temperature of the gas , @xmath11 is the depth of the line ( or r.m.s .",

    "this latter parameter accounts for the possibility that the absorbing gas may not fully cover all of the background radio emission pc in diameter , whereas radio sources can exceed @xmath14 pc ( see @xcite ) . ] and so all of the measured flux , @xmath12 , may not be intercepted , decreasing the sensitivity of the observation .    in both the associated and intervening cases",
    "the detections occur overwhelmingly at @xmath15 . for the associated systems , @xmath16 is generally not known , although @xcite attribute the lack of absorption at high redshift to the traditional optical selection of targets biasing searches towards the most luminous objects at these large distances , where the ultra - violet luminosity ionises the neutral gas .    in the optically thin regime ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "[ enew ] reduces to @xmath18 , thus giving a degeneracy in the spin temperature / covering factor ratio ( @xmath19 ) , for the dlas where the column density is known . therefore , since there is a mix of detections and non - detections in dlas at @xmath20 , whereas at @xmath21  21-cm tends not to be detected , @xcite suggest an evolution in the spin temperature of the gas , where this is exclusively high at high redshift .",
    "this has direct bearing on the relative proportions of the cold and warm neutral media ( e.g. @xcite ) and thus the reservoir of raw material available for star formation in the early universe .",
    "however , the conclusion that the spin temperature evolves with redshift relies on the assumption of a covering factor for each dla , and @xcite have shown that , if the degeneracy is left intact , @xmath19 is not the order of magnitude larger at @xmath21 , as suggested by the @xmath10 distribution of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggest that geometry effects introduced by an expanding universe could contribute to the distribution , indicating that the covering factor may actually be the dominant parameter .",
    "since then there have been further high redshift searches @xcite .",
    "this takes the number of confirmed dlas and sub - dlas searched for 21-cm to 25 at @xmath22 , the same number as at @xmath23 , thus allowing us to adequately address the spin temperature versus covering factor issue .",
    "although there are now equal numbers of 21-cm searches above and below @xmath24 , the detection rate at @xmath1 remains considerably lower ( 5 out of 25 ) than for the lower redshift sample ( 14 out of 25 ) . since the velocity integrated optical depth of the 21-cm absorption , normalised by the total neutral hydrogen column density , is proportional to @xmath25 ( sect .",
    "[ intro ] ) , this suggests that either @xmath10 is generally higher at @xmath1 or that @xmath13 is generally lower , or a combination of both , elevating the ratio at high redshift ,    in order to obtain limits to the line strengths for the non - detections we must assign a profile width to each absorber .",

    "when neither the mgii equivalent width nor metallicity are available , we assign a fwhm of @xmath29 , the mean of the detections .    given the fwhm of the putative line , in order to obtain the best signal - to - noise ratio , based upon the detection of a single channel we would smooth the data to a spectral resolution of @xmath30fwhm .",
    "this has the effect of improving / degrading the measured r.m.s noise , and thus the optical depth , by a factor of @xmath31 .",

    "this has the overall effect of scaling the previously published integrated optical depths , where these are calculated per channel , by @xmath34_{\\rm new}/\\left[\\int\\tau dv \\right]_{\\rm previous}$ ]",
    "@xmath35        we therefore recalculate the limits from the published r.m.s .",

    "[ comp - spin ] show the effect this has on the @xmath19 limits compared to the previous values . for the method prescribed above ( shown as circles ) ,",
    "the largest change is for the @xmath36 absorber towards pks0118272 , for which the limit climbs from @xmath37  k @xcite to @xmath38 k and , on average , the scaled values are 160  k `` warmer '' than those published .",
    "as seen from the figure , however , the new limits are mostly concentrated close the @xmath34_{\\rm new } = \\left[\\int\\tau dv \\right]_{\\rm previous}$ ] line , with equal numbers of points to either side .",
    "@xcite attribute the correlation between the velocity spreads of the 21-cm and mgii profiles to the neutral and singly ionised gas being spatially coincident in 21-cm detected dlas .",

    "[ toverf ] we show the newly derived limits against the absorption redshift .",
    "applying a survival analysis to the @xmath39 lower limits in @xmath19 , via the asurv package @xcite , we obtain mean values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 . that is , the mean value of @xmath19 at @xmath1 is double that at @xmath42 ( 3600 cf .",
    "this is considerably less than the ratio of 8.0 between the two redshift regimes ( 8100 cf .",
    "1020 k ) found by applying the survival analysis to the spin temperatures of @xcite . since our recalculation of the limits has actually slightly increased the mean value of the spin temperature / covering factor degeneracy , we attribute this significant difference to the covering factor being left as a free parameter .",
    "the addition of the new data , together with our treatment of the non - detections , indicates that a factor of only @xmath43 in the spin temperature / covering factor ratio between the two redshift regimes need be accounted for .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether @xmath10 or @xmath13 is the dominant factor .",
    "there have been several attempts to quantify the covering factor through very long baseline array ( vlba ) imaging of the background quasar , in which @xmath13 is estimated as the ratio of the compact unresolved component s flux to the total radio flux ( e.g. @xcite ) . from this , @xcite conclude that for the 21-cm searches , @xmath44 and hence low covering factors can not explain the dearth of detections at high redshift .",
    "however , this method gives no information on the extent of the absorber nor on how effectively it covers the emission .",
    "neither does it give information on the depth of the line when the extended continuum emission is resolved out .",
    "so although an evolution in spin temperature with redshift is implied , this method invokes several crucial assumptions which could even lead to unphysical results ( e.g. the @xmath45 pc obtained for the extent of pks 0405331 at 398 mhz , @xcite ) . on the other hand , due to the effects of an expanding universe , objects at @xmath46 are always close to a single angular diameter distance ( @xmath47  mpc ) , irrespective of redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) . beyond @xmath48 , the angular diameter distance",
    "_ decreases _ with increasing redshift , which will lead to a natural imbalance between the low and high - z dla samples . in the small angle approximation",
    "the covering factor can be defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the angle subtended by the background emission and @xmath51 and @xmath52 the linear sizes of the cool absorbing gas and background 21-cm emission , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ dla_schem ] ) .",
    "since absorbers at @xmath53 are always at a similar angular diameter distance as the background quasar ( @xmath54 ) , these will therefore , for a given system , always have a lower coverage than a counterpart with @xmath55 @xcite , an inequality which can only exist at @xmath15 .    in fig .",
    "[ distance - z ] we show the angular diameter distance ratio , @xmath56 , versus the absorption redshift for the 21-cm searches .        note that this distribution is free from any assumptions ( including our own with regard to the fwhms of the non - detections ) . from this",
    "we see a mix of @xmath56 at low redshift ( the low values are due to @xmath15 dlas towards much higher redshift quasars ) , whereas values at @xmath53 are exclusively high .",
    "that is , a reproduction of the `` spin temperature '' distribution of @xcite .",
    "at least the pattern if not the magnitude , given that @xcite suggest that the average spin temperature at @xmath1 is eight times that at @xmath2 , which is clearly not reproduced in fig .",
    "[ distance - z ] .    referring to sect .",

    "[ f ] , for a given absorber and emitter size , @xmath57 , and we find mean values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , a ratio of 1.6 .",
    "it is therefore apparent that the distribution in angular diameter distance ratios , and their effect on the covering factor , is close to that required to account for the observed @xmath19 distribution .",
    "updating the statistics with the new results , we find a binomial probability of @xmath60 of obtaining at least 9 out of 11 detections at @xmath61 and 29 out of 39 non - detections at @xmath62 , by chance .",
    "is the cut used by @xcite and , although arbitrary , this is the lowest ratio which gives an appreciable enough sample size in the lower bin .",
    "when a ratio of 0.9 is used there are 38 dlas with @xmath63 and 12 with @xmath64 , which increases the significance of the correlation to @xmath65 . ]",
    "that is , a significance of @xmath66 , lending weight to the argument that large angular diameter distance ratios are correlated with the non - detection of 21-cm absorption .",
    "since there is no physical link between the spin temperature and angular diameter distance ratio , this suggests that , in the absence of any knowledge of the absorption cross - section in relation to the emitter extent , the covering factor plays a much more major rle than the spin temperature in the detection of 21-cm absorption .",
    "with the advent of 21-cm absorption searches in high redshift dlas there has been much debate on whether an evolution in spin temperature or lower covering factors are responsible for the relatively low number of detections at @xmath1 .",
    "new searches of sdss dlas , which occult the sight - lines to radio - loud quasars , take the number searched at these redshifts to the same as at @xmath2 , giving much needed data with which to address this issue . by giving the 21-cm non - detections a more thorough analysis than in other studies , through estimating the fwhms of the non - detected profiles from the observed optical properties and applying a survival analysis to the lower limits in @xmath19 , we find :    1 .",
    "that mean the spin temperature / covering factor ratio at @xmath1 is only double that found at @xmath2 .",
    "this is significantly lower than the factor of eight in spin temperature , determined from previous estimates of the covering factor .",
    "this reduced factor can be accounted for by the effects of an expanding universe , where the angular diameter distance at @xmath67 is always close to , and sometimes exceeds , that of the background radio source .",
    "that is , the high redshift dlas are _ always _ disadvantaged in how effectively they can intercept the background radio flux for a given dla ",
    "3 .   since the non - detections tend to be associated with high ratios in the dla  qso angular diameter distances ( @xmath68 ) , whereas the detections are associated with low ratios ( @xmath69 ) , at _ all _ redshifts , this strongly suggests that the coverage of the background radio source by the absorber is the dominant factor .",
    "this runs contrary to previous studies which estimate the covering factor via vlba imaging , which support an evolution in the spin temperature .",
    "however , these estimates are based upon several pivotal assumptions , whereas the angular diameter distance ratios are not .",
    "we therefore suggest that there is no evidence for the spin temperature to increase with redshift , which implies no evolution in the fraction of the warm neutral gas content of dlas .",
    "@xcite find a @xmath19metallicity anti - correlation .",
    "if the spin temperature does not evolve with redshift , as does the metallicity @xcite , this may imply that the metallicity is proportional to the covering factor , which could be due to the larger absorbing cross - sections of the larger galaxies , as evident through the spirals which have the largest metallicities and the lower values of @xmath19 @xcite .",
