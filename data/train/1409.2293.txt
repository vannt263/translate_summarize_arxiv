    "the nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd)@xcite factorization approach is widely used to describe the production and decay of heavy quarkonium and acquires significant achievements since it was proposed .",
    "the surplus production of @xmath0 and @xmath7 in the large transverse momentum region at the tevatron and the lhc seems to be a powerful evidence in favor of nrqcd@xcite . in particular , the complete next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections ( including the contributions from the color - octet and color - singlet channels ) were introduced which illustrate an identical set of long distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) can satisfy all the @xmath0 yield data at hadron colliders@xcite .",
    "additionally , @xmath8 production at hadron colliders are proved to be a successful case for the nlo nrqcd calculations@xcite . for the long - pending polarization puzzle of @xmath0 production",
    ", it seems also to be understood naturally using the nlo calculation@xcite .",
    "subsequently , the nlo analysis is also made for the @xmath9 production at hadron colliders and fit the data well using a set of compilable ldmes with the @xmath0 polarization@xcite .    however , the puzzles are still remained .",
    "the university of the ldmes is one of the most important things .",
    "the color - octet ldmes extracted from the @xmath0 yield data by the different theoretical groups were incompatible with each other .",
    "for the @xmath0 polarization and @xmath9 production , there are also different views in which nlo nrqcd calculations can not explain the data@xcite .",
    "the entirely difference conclusions are caused by the different selections of the ldmes .",
    "it seems the there color - octet ldmes ( @xmath10 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) can not be determined only by the present hadroproduction data of @xmath0 production independently . in the work of chao s group , they introduce two linear combination of the there color - octet ldmes .",
    "only the two new ldmes are extracted from the data and the @xmath11 will be reduced substantially .",
    "it may imply the higher order corrections should be considered to determine the exact magnitude of the three color - octet ldmes .",
    "meanwhile , the analysis combined with the data at other colliders @xcite or the data of other charmonium ( @xmath9)@xcite production may help to determine the magnitude of there color - octet ldmes .    the inclusive @xmath0 production in @xmath1 annihilation is a probe to check the color - octet mechanism and will provide a way to place restrictions on the color - octet ldmes .",
    "the color - octet channels in the inclusive @xmath0 production only involve @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels . in the pervious work@xcite , a constraint of the color - octet ldmes",
    "was obtained using the data of the inclusive @xmath0 production at b - factory . meanwhile",
    ", some data of the exclusive @xmath0 production near the @xmath0 mass threshold had been released . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to give a constraint of the color - octet ldmes within the inclusive @xmath0 production in @xmath1 annihilation including the energy region at b - factory and the near - threshold region .",
    "at b - factory , the large gaps between the lo predictions and the experimental data in the exclusive and inclusive production of @xmath0 have been greatly alleviated with the nlo corrections in the color - singlet frame@xcite .",
    "it leaves little room for the color - octet mechanism . in the previous work@xcite ,",
    "the authors gave a limit superior of the combined color - octet matrix elements ( @xmath14 ) using the nlo results in @xmath15 .",
    "in this paper , the relativistic corrections are also considered besides the radiative corrections , then the constraint will be revised as @xmath16 with the following input parameters @xmath17 the above matrix element @xmath18 is defined as the ratios of the nlo ldmes in @xmath19 to the lo ldmes , @xmath20 the strong - coupling constant @xmath15 is evolved by the two - loop formula , @xmath21 where @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the one - loop and two - loop coefficients of the qcd beta function , respectively .",
    "@xmath26 is the renormalization scale and @xmath27 is the active quark flavors which is set to @xmath28 for charmonium just as the case in this paper . in eq.([eq : me_limit ] ) , we choose two cases for the renormalization scale as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , to show the uncertainties from renormalization scale .",
    "the values of ldmes of @xmath0 extracted from the experimental @xmath31 hadronic production by five theory groups are shown in tab.([tab : matrix ] ) @xcite .",
    "these values illustrate the difficulties to determined the color - octet ldmes .",
    "the series of works by chao s group imply a wide range of values for @xmath32 can satisfy the yield and polarization data of the @xmath0 production .",
    "the polarization puzzle can be understood in two different ways : the contributions from @xmath33 and @xmath34 channels should cancel to each other or be small .",
    "the latter way requests very small values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding values of the combined matrix elements are also listed in the table .",
    "most of the sets of ldmes do not satisfy the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ eq : me_limit ] ) except the set of ldmes fitted by butenschoen s group .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the theoretical calculations , the reliable predictions can not be obtained at the region extremely near the threshold .",
    "therefore , our calculations will concentrate on the energy regions of @xmath2 in which the non - perturbative effects are suppressed .",
    "the short - distance cross sections are shown in tab.([tab : sd_nearthresold ] ) .",
    "the relativistic and radiative corrections are included for the color - octet channels .",
    "for the color - singlet channel , we give only the leading order results but one will find their numerical values are smaller in comparison with the color - octet channels even the higher corrections are considered ( we argue that the nlo corrections may enhance the color - singlet short - distance cross sections by a factor of about 2 ) . from the table , one can see that the short - distance cross sections of @xmath38 channel are three order of magnitude larger than that of color - singlet channel .",
    "the short - distance cross sections of @xmath39 channel are about two order of magnitude lager than that of color - singlet channel .",
    "the total cross sections are sensitive to the selections of the color - octet ldmes .",
    "the large short - distance coefficients shown in tab.([tab : sd_nearthresold ] ) imply the values of the ldmes should be small .",
    "the negative cross sections may be obtained for the large negative @xmath40-wave ldmes .",
    "for example , using the ldmes fitted by butenschoen s group , the total cross sections in the energy region of @xmath2 will be negative . for the @xmath12 ldmes in order of @xmath41 , the contributions from @xmath12 channel may saturate or overshoot the data .",
    "next , we try to give a constraint of ldmes using the above calculations in the energy region of @xmath2 . as mentioned above",
    ", the numerical values of the total inclusive cross sections must be larger than that of the cross sections in the process of @xmath42 and may be above @xmath43 as the below expression , @xmath44 considering the color - singlet matrix element @xmath45 is at the order of @xmath46 and referring to tab.([tab : sd_nearthresold ] ) , the color - singlet cross sections would be less than @xmath43 .",
    "therefore we consider a looser constraint for the co ldmes as , @xmath47 but , we note that the color - singlet channels may contribute to the total cross sections for the color - singlet ldme is one or two orders of magnitude larger than the color - octet ldmes .",
    "the results of the constraint are shown in fig.([fig : lems ] ) .",
    "the gray area shows the constraints to ldmes combined the data at b - factory and in the energy region of @xmath2 .",
    "as shown in fig.([fig : lems ] ) , all the ldmes fitted at hadron colliders are incompatible with the constraint .",
    "it brings challenges to the university of the nrqcd ldmes .",
    "the dependence of the renormalization scale can be seen in the figure in which both the cases with @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given .",
    "the upper limit constrained by b - factory data seems to little heavily depend on the renormalization scale compared with the lower limit by near - threshold data . the inclusive production in the @xmath48 annihilation",
    "restrict the ldmes to a extremely small area .",
    "the @xmath40-wave ldmes @xmath35 are restricted into the region of about @xmath49 .",
