    "this paper contains a portion of the material presented by lee lindblom in the talk `` relativistic instabilities in compact stars '' at the fourth amaldi conference on gravitational waves .",
    "most of the material presented in that talk has already been published , and so we limit our discussion here to that material which has not previously appeared in print .",
    "we direct those readers who might be interested in the wider range of subjects covered in the talk to the recent review lindblom ( 2001 ) , and the recent papers lindblom , tohline and vallisneri ( 2001b ) and lindblom and owen ( 2001 ) .",
    "gravitational radiation ( gr ) is a de - stabilizing force on the @xmath0-modes of rotating neutron stars ( andersson 1998 , friedman and morsink 1998 ) .",
    "the first estimates of the timescales associated with this instability ( lindblom , owen and morsink 1998 ) showed that the gr driving force is much stronger than the stabilizing effects of the simplest forms of viscous dissipation in neutron stars . as a consequence",
    "there has been a great deal of interest in this instability as a potential source of observable gr , and as a mechanism for removing angular momentum from rapidly rotating neutron stars . during the past several years the effects of a number of additional dissipation mechanisms on the @xmath0-mode instability",
    "have been studied in some detail .",
    "a number of these mechanisms are much more effective in suppressing the @xmath0-mode instability than the simple viscosity considered in the initial estimates .",
    "in particular the effects of a solid crust ( bildsten and ushomirsky 2000 , lindblom , owen and ushomirsky 2000 , wu , matzner and arras 2001 ) , the effects of magnetic fields ( rezzolla , 2001a , 2001b , mendell 2001 ) , the non - linear effects of mode - mode coupling ( schenk , 2001 ) , and the effects of hyperon bulk viscosity ( jones 2001a , 2001b , lindblom and owen 2001 ) make it appear less likely that the gr instability in the @xmath0-modes will play an interesting role in astrophysics .",
    "however , at the present time none of these mechanisms is understood well enough for us to conclude absolutely that the @xmath0-mode instability will never play a role in any neutron stars .",
    "thus for the purposes of the present paper , we assume that the instability will occur in some rapidly rotating neutron stars . our aim here is to present the best estimate of the gr that might be emitted during such an instability . to do this we analyze the gr emitted by the best currently available numerical simulation of the non - linear evolution of the @xmath0-mode instability .",
    "this paper is an update of the initial estimates of the gr emitted by the @xmath0-mode instability given by owen , ( 1998 ) .",
    "we base our estimates of the gr produced by the non - linear evolution of an unstable @xmath0-mode , on the numerical simulations by lindblom , tohline and vallisneri ( 2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "the evolution of a small amplitude @xmath7 @xmath0-mode subject to the current - quadrupole gr reaction force was studied numerically in a @xmath8 polytropic neutron star rotating at about 95% of its breakup angular velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the evolution of the current quadrupole moment @xmath9 ( in cgs units ) of this model as the simulation evolves .",
    "the current quadrupole moment is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the density and velocity of the fluid in the star , and @xmath13 is the magnetic type vector spherical harmonic ( thorne 1980 ) .",
    "the time displayed along the horizontal axis of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is given in units of the initial rotation period of the star : @xmath14ms . during the first part of the evolution",
    "gr drives the growth of the @xmath0-mode , leading to the exponential growth in @xmath15 illustrated here .",
    "once the amplitude of the mode becomes sufficiently large , however , non - linear hydrodynamic processes also become important . these lead to large surface waves which break and shock ( see lindblom , tohline and vallisneri 2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "the dissipation in these shocks damps the @xmath0-mode and leads to the rapid decrease in @xmath15 following its peak .",
    "0.6 cm evolution of the current quadrupole moment @xmath15 ( in cgs units ) from the numerical simulation of the gr driven growth of the @xmath7 @xmath0-mode.,title=\"fig:\",height=192 ]    the timescale of the gr instability in the @xmath0-modes is much much longer than the hydrodynamic timescale . to perform the numerical simulation illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] it was necessary to increase artificially the strength of the gr driving force so that the instability could proceed more rapidly .",
    "fortunately tests have shown ( see lindblom , tohline and vallisneri 2001b ) that the maximum amplitude which the @xmath0-mode achieves ( and hence the maximum value of @xmath15 ) is relatively insensitive to the strength of the gr driving force .",
    "the amplitude grows until the velocities in the mode reach some critical value before the waves break and shock .",
    "the value of this critical velocity appears to be relatively insensitive to how rapidly the fluid velocity is increased to this critical level .    to determine the gr signal that would be emitted by the growth of an unstable @xmath0-mode , it is necessary to re - scale the time in the simulation .",
    "the early part of the simulation has been designed to proceed more rapidly than the physical case by the factor @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents the gr growth timescale of the instability .",
    "this ratio has the value 4488 in the simulation used here .",
    "thus the early exponential growth phase of a physical @xmath0-mode evolution will last longer than this phase of the simulation by this factor .",
    "the late stages of the simulation are dominated by hydrodynamic forces which damp the @xmath0-mode within a few rotation periods .",
    "this final stage of the evolution therefore proceeds at the same rate in both the physical and the simulation cases .",
    "we ( somewhat artificially ) choose the dividing time between the early and late stages of the evolution to be the time at which the value of @xmath9 is maximum .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath15 is found in the simulation to be nearly sinusoidal with a time dependent amplitude , @xmath18 , ( with @xmath19 constant ) because @xmath15 is dominated by the unstable @xmath0-mode in this case .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath9 is illustrated in fig .",
    "the frequency of the sinusoidal time dependence is conveniently determined numerically using the formula @xmath20 this approximation introduces errors of order @xmath21 in our simulation . figure  [ fig2 ] illustrates the evolution of the frequency , @xmath22 , determined numerically in this way .",
    "here we plot the frequency as a function of the re - scaled physical time ( in seconds ) .",
    "we note that the frequency changes by only a few percent during the course of the evolution in which about 40% of the angular momentum of the star is radiated away as gr .    0.6 cm evolution of the `` frequency '' of the @xmath0-mode .",
    "the time parameter used here ( in seconds ) is scaled from the simulation to reflect the physical case until the formation of shocks .",
    "noise early in the simulation is due to contamination of the current quadrupole @xmath15 by other modes.,title=\"fig:\",height=192 ]    in general relativity theory an isolated object with time dependent current quadrupole moment radiates gr .",
    "the expression for the dimensionless gr amplitude @xmath23 ( averaged over possible source and detector orientations ) is given by @xmath24 are newton s constant and the speed of light , and @xmath25 is the distance to the source .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] illustrates the time dependence of this dimensionless gr amplitude as a function of time as determined by the simulation .",
    "since the frequency of these @xmath0-mode oscillations is essentially constant , the gr amplitude just grows in proportion to @xmath15 . once the amplitude peaks , non - linear hydrodynamic forces ( i.e. shocks ) quickly damp the mode and",
    "this is reflected in the sharp drop in @xmath23 ( as a function of physical time ) illustrated in fig .",
    "we have chosen @xmath26mpc , the distance to the virgo cluster of galaxies , for the purposes of the illustration .",
    "optimistic estimates of the event rate for these objects suggests that the nearest events expected during the time frame of the ligo observations will be at this distance .",

    "the optimal signal to noise ratio ( @xmath4 ) for detecting a gr signal can be achieved with the use of an optimal filter , consisting of a template that matches the waveform of the signal .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the fourier transform of the gr signal : @xmath29 the discrete fourier transform of the gravitational wave signal from our numerical simulation is shown in fig .",
    "here we have smoothed the resulting @xmath30 with a windowing function of width @xmath31hz .",
    "we see that the spectrum of the gravitational radiation is confined essentially to the band @xmath32hz , which corresponds well with the evolution of the frequency of the @xmath0-mode as shown in fig .",

    "when a function such as @xmath33 involves a rapid oscillation together with a much slower evolution of its amplitude and frequency , the fourier transform @xmath68 is well approximated by the stationary phase approximation , @xmath69 for a complex signal @xmath33 .",

    "we note that this argument can easily be extended to signals composed of multiple harmonics and multipoles so long as their frequencies are well - defined : time - averaging of eq .",
    "( [ e : sphase ] ) eliminates cross - terms , so eq .  ( [ e : sn3 ] ) is simply summed over each harmonic and @xmath65",

    "( [ e : sphase ] ) to express eq .",
    "( [ e : sn ] ) as an integral over time and dividing @xmath76 into piecewise monotonic parts .",
    "it is not unreasonable to think that a realistic data analysis strategy could come within a factor of 2 of the optimal @xmath4 . due to the complexity of the physics",
    "involved it seems unlikely that matched filtering will ever be a viable option .",
    "however , cross - correlation of the output of two aligned interferometers ( ligo hanford and ligo livingston ) can in principle achieve @xmath77 of optimal @xmath4 if the detectors noise is of comparable strength and uncorrelated  including non - gaussian noise bursts ( anderson 2001 ) .",
    "this strategy relies on the supernova associated with the @xmath0-mode having been observed optically , allowing the appropriate time delay to be inserted between the interferometer data streams . narrowing the search to a few minutes after the supernova ( instead of continuous operation )",
    "also has the effect of greatly reducing the @xmath4 threshold for detection with reasonable false alarm statistics .",
    "thus a cross - correlation with @xmath78 might be considered enough for detection , implying a realistically detectable distance for @xmath0-modes of 5  mpc for even the least optimal ( for this type of source ) ligo ii configuration  and up to 50  mpc for the most optimal .",
