    "asymptotic giants branch ( agb ) and post - agb stars are the principal suppliers of heavy metals and important suppliers of carbon and nitrogen to the interstellar medium .",
    "it is currently believed that about half of metals heavier than iron are synthesized in the s - process in deep layers of agb  stars with initial masses @xmath0 .",
    "newly synthesized nuclei are moved to surface levels of the star by mixing ( the socalled third mixing , tdu ) and , under the influence of the stellar wind , into the circumstellar medium .",
    "a detailed description of these processes and additional references can be found in reviews by @xcite and @xcite . by supplying heavy metals and carbon to the interstellar medium ,",
    "agb stars participate in the chemical evolution of their galaxies as a whole .",
    "however , although observations have enabled the identification of numerous evolved stars with carbon - enriched envelopes , the ejection of heavy metals into the circumstellar medium has not been directly detected .",
    "on the hertzsprung  russell diagram stars with initial mass approximately @xmath1 undergoing the short - lived protoplanetary nebulae ( ppn ) stage evolve from the agb toward the planetary nebula ( pn ) stage at almost constant luminosity , getting increasingly hotter in the process .",
    "these descendants of agb stars are low - mass cores with typical masses of @xmath2 surrounded by an extended and often structured gaseous envelope , which formed as a result of substantial mass loss by the star during the preceding evolutionary stages .",
    "the internal structure of an agb  star is very specific .",
    "a degenerate c / o core is surrounded by thin helium and hydrogen shells nuclear processing in which become in turn active .",
    "thus final phase of agb evolution is characterized by recurrent thermal pulses in helium shell .",
    "each thermal pulse causes an increase in convection and dredge - up of fresh synthesized carbon and heavy metals to surface stellar layers . in the case of more massive stars with initial masses",
    "@xmath3 hot - bottom burning ( hbb ) provides a synthesis of lower - mass chemical elements from ne to si ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have carried out numerous spectroscopic observations of supergiants with ir excesses using the 6-m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory over the past two decades .",
    "the initial aim of the program was to determine the fundamental parameters of the program stars and to study chemical abundance anomalies in their atmospheres .",
    "the combined information we have obtained can be used to reliably identify a star evolutionary stage . in the course of this program ,",
    "we recognized the need for additional studies aimed at identifying spectral peculiarities and time variations of the spectral features .",
    "studies of the velocity fields in the atmospheres and envelopes of the program stars were also required .",
    "spectral data were mainly obtained at the nasmyth focus of the 6-meter telescope with the nes spectrograph developed by @xcite using a 2048@xmath42048-pixel or 2048@xmath44096-pixel ccd chip and an image slicer , providing a spectroscopic resolving power of r=60000 within a wide wavelength range to be observed simultaneously .",
    "the spectra of faint stars ( the optical counterparts of the ir sources iras04296 + 3429 and 20000 + 3239 ) were obtained with the pfes echelle spectrograph designed by @xcite at the primary focus of the 6-m telescope . with a 1024@xmath41024-pixel ccd chip ,",
    "this spectrograph provides a resolving power of r=15000 .",

    "these objects are found to exhibit a great variety of peculiarities in the optical spectra of their central stars , the chemical composition of their atmospheres and envelopes , and the morphology and kinematic state of their circumstellar envelopes .",
    "we should point out , in particular , that supergiants with infrared excess include rvtau type variables .",
    "these variable stars with near - infrared excesses undergo the post ",
    "agb evolutionary stage , and , as it was shown by @xcite , most of them are binaries .    besides some stars of the program were identified as belonging to massive stars far evolved .",
    "most known objects with unclear status are high luminous stars v1302aql ( = irc+10420 ) and hd179821 ( = iras19114 + 0002 ) .",
    "their properties ( high luminosity , spectral peculiarities , presence of circumstellar envelopes ) are similar to that observing for ppn . but",
    "thanks to the reinforced research during last decades ( see @xcite and numerous references therein ) both stars are now considered to be the most unambiguous massive stars with a highest mass loss rate which undergoes a short - term evolutionary transition from a red supergiant to a wolf - rayet star .",
    "predecessors of the yellow hypergiants are massive ( initial mass @xmath23 m@xmath24 ) and the most luminous stars , which lose a significant part of their mass after leaving main - sequence , become red supergiants , and later proceed to yellow supergiants .",
    "quite opposite conclusions were obtained for the star bd@xmath251178 which was considered to be a candidate to ppn according to the observed excess of radiation in the 1260@xmath26 m wavelength region and its position on the ir colour  colour diagram . but @xcite based on the high - resolution spectra are shown for the first time that bd@xmath251178 is a spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) .",
    "their components have close spectral types and luminosity classes : f5iv  iii and f3v .",
    "the classification of bd@xmath251178 as a supergiant in the transition stage of becoming a planetary nebula does not confirm .",
    "bd@xmath271178 probably is a young pre - ms stars .",
    "moreover it is possibly a member of the 1c subgroup of the oriob1 association .",
    "the next important results of our study is the formation of a small homogeneous subsample of ppne whose atmospheres are enriched in carbon and heavy metals synthesized during the agb evolution .",
    "all these objects are listed in table[ppn ] .",
    "their ir spectra contain an unidentified emission feature at 21@xmath26 @xcite which arises in the circumstellar medium .",
    "the large excesses of carbon and heavy metals in the atmospheres of these post - agb stars in table[ppn ] were found for the central stars of iras04296 + 3429 @xcite , 07134 + 1005 @xcite , 23304 + 6147 @xcite ; 20000 + 3239 @xcite ; rafgl 2688 @xcite ; and for iras 22272 + 5435 @xcite .",
    "the chemical abundances for five of the stars from table[ppn ] were also determined by @xcite .",
    "in addition to objects with carbon - enriched atmospheres , table[ppn ] also contains the poorly studied ir source iras 08005@xmath102356 .",
    "data on the atmospheric elemental abundances of its central star or the presence of the 21@xmath26 band in its ir spectrum are not available .",
    "however , @xcite consider iras 08005@xmath102356 to be related to the other sources in table[ppn ] , because its optical spectrum contains swan bands of c@xmath5 and emissions of neutral hydrogen , with some metal lines displaying emission ",
    "absorption profiles , and its circumstellar envelope was detected by @xcite in co emission .",
    "thus , we may suspect that iras 08005@xmath102356 a full member of this small sample .",
    "we tried to consider additional manifestations of circumstellar envelopes in the optical spectra of post - agb stars , concentrating on an analysis of this uniform sample of stars whose atmospheric chemical abundances have been shown in earlier former studies to have changed in the course of their evolution .",
    "attempts to find an interconnection between the morphology of the envelope and the peculiarities of the chemical composition of the central star revealed no strict correlation .",
    "it may nevertheless be concluded that objects with enriched atmospheres ( iras02229 + 6208 , 04296 + 3429 , 19500@xmath101709 , and 23304 + 6147 ) mostly have structured ( bipolar , quadrupole , etc ) envelopes .",
    "however , objects with enriched atmospheres also include iras05113 + 1347 , whose envelope even the hst failed to resolve , as well as iras05341 + 0852 and 07134 + 1005 with envelopes in the form of elongated haloes .",
    "one should also pay attention to iras19475 + 3119 , which has a structured envelope , whereas the atmosphere of its central star hd331319 is not enriched in either carbon or heavy metals .",
    "however , strong helium lines were found by @xcite in the spectrum of hd331319 .",
    "the presence of these lines in the spectrum of a star with t@xmath28k results in a significant helium overabundance was detected by @xcite in its atmosphere .",
    "it should be mentioned here about detection of large lithium and sodium overabundance for the star v2324cyg ( = iras20572 + 4919 ) ( see more details @xcite ) .",
    "results for these two stars permit us to propose that their initial mass was more than @xmath29 and hbb and dredge - up were effective at their agb stage .",
    "further , we concentrate on new properties of the optical spectra of a small subsample of post - agb stars , from the table[ppn ] whose circumstellar envelopes of these stars have complex morphologies , and are also enriched in carbon , manifest in the presence of c@xmath5 , c@xmath30 , cn , co and other molecular bands . we analyze in detail main features of the optical spectra that form in extended gas and dust envelopes and atmospheric radial velocity pattern measured on all spectral features .",
    "the circumstellar envelopes of these stars contain extended halos , arcs , tori , etc .",
    "some stellar envelopes display combinations of these features , and they can possess bipolar or quadrupole circumstellar structures .",
    "optical spectra post - agb supergiants differ from those of classical high - mass supergiants in the presence of molecular bands overlying the spectrum of the f  g supergiant , anomalies of the hi , nai , and hei absorption and emission profiles , and emission lines of some metals ( for details see @xcite ) . moreover",
    ", all these spectral properties vary with time .    in general , we see the following types of features in the optical spectra of post - agb supergiants : 1 ) symmetric absorption lines with low or moderate intensities , without obvious anomalies ; 2 ) complex neutral - hydrogen line profiles containing time - variable absorption and emission components ; 3 ) absorption or emission bands of molecules , often those containing carbon ; 4 ) shell components of the nai and ki resonance lines ; and 5 ) narrow forbidden or permitted emission lines of metals formed in the envelope .      our many - year spectroscopic monitoring of post - agb stars has enabled us to detect a previously unknown characteristic of the spectra of selected post - agb stars : splitting ( or asymmetry ) of the strongest absorptions of heavy metals ions ( srii , baii , laii , yii ) .",
    "this peculiarity has now been detected in the five stars presented in table[ppn ] : cycmi @xcite , v354lac @xcite , v448 lac @xcite , v5112sgr @xcite , and cgcs6918 @xcite .",
    "the strongest effect is for baii ions ( see fig.[v5112 ] ) , whose lines with excitation potentials of the lower levels @xmath31ev can be split into two or three components .",
    "infrared and radio spectroscopy data are used to show that the stable individual components of split absorptions are formed in structured circumstellar envelopes .",
    "thus , this effect reveals efficient enrichment of the envelope in heavy metals synthesized during the agb evolution .",
    "we suggest that nature of the strong absorption profile ( split or asymmetric , number of components ) could be related to the morphology and kinematical and chemical properties of the envelope .",
    "the splitting of the profiles of the strongest absorptions of heavy metals detected in the spectra of the supergiants v5112sgr , v354lac , and cgcs6918 , whose extended envelopes have complex structures , suggests that the formation of a strong , structured envelope in the agb stage is accompanied by the ejection of stellar nucleosynthesis products into the circumstellar medium . attempts to find a direct connection between the characteristics of the optical spectrum and the morphology of the circumstellar medium",
    "are hindered by the fact that the observed structure of the envelope depends strongly on the inclination of the symmetry axis to the line of site , and also on the spectral and angular resolution of data and images used .",
    "recall that the so called diffuse bands ( dibs ) well known in the spectroscopy of the interstellar medium are present in the optical spectra of numerous post - agb stars .",
    "but it should be here emphasized that in the spectrum of v5112sgr we found several dibs whose accurate mean ( from three spectra ) radial velocity is in excellent agreement with the velocity derived from the circumstellar component of the nai  d lines .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the diffuse bands are formed in the circumstellar envelope @xcite .",
    "we plan to continue in future our spectral research focusing on the fainter post - agb stars with strong circumstellar envelopes .",
    "complex morphology of envelopes suggests that these stars suffered in the past several events of mass loss due to stellar winds of different rates .",
    "it means that we may expect manifestations of stellar nucleosynthesis in their atmospheres and circumstellar environment . for observations of such faint objects we need to improve the efficiency of our observational methods",
    "i thank the organizers for the possibility to present this review .",
    "i am grateful to all co - authors of my articles .",
