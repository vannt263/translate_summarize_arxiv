    "a larger class of heusler alloys has such peculiar electronic and magnetic properties  @xcite , which -in combination with large magnetic moments and high curie temperatures- makes these materials attractive for the design of single - spin electron sources  @xcite and spin injectors  @xcite in the field of magnetoelectronics and related technological applications .    within the series of co@xmath0msi compounds ( for m = ti , v , cr , mn , fe ,",
    "co , ni ) , co@xmath0fesi and co@xmath0mnsi were studied to some extent . for co@xmath0mnsi a curie temperature of t@xmath1 = 985 k and a total magnetic moment of about 5 @xmath2  @xcite were measured . for co@xmath0fesi , the measured curie temperature of t@xmath1 = 1100 k is the highest for all known heusler alloys reflecting the large total magnetic moment of about 6 @xmath2  @xcite .",

    ", the half - metal ferromagnetic property could be recaptured , as it is claimed by experiment .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , by means of a dft approach we examined the series of heusler alloys co@xmath0msi ( with m = ti , v , cr , mn , fe , co , ni ) assuming they crystallize in the typical l2@xmath3 structure .",
    "for all these compounds we derived magnetic and electronic properties as well as thermodynamical stabilities and elastic properties . in the seven compounds , only for m = ti , v , mn , fe compounds with the l2@xmath3 structure were synthesized .",
    "@xcite the experimentally claimed structure of co@xmath0cosi ( or co@xmath4si ) is of the d0@xmath5 type at temperatures of about 1200   whereas below 1192  the compound could not be stabilized .",
    "@xcite concerning co@xmath0crsi and co@xmath0nisi , no experimental data are available in literature .",
    "nevertheless , for the sake of completeness and comparison , co@xmath0crsi , co@xmath0cosi , and co@xmath0nisi with the l2@xmath3 structure are included in our study .",
    "our dft calculations were performed by application of the plane wave vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite in its projector augmented wave formulation for the potentials . the exchange - correlation potential and energy were described within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew and wang  @xcite in combination with the parametrization of vosko et al .",

    "local properties ( such as projected densities of states and local magnetic moments ) were determined within suitably chosen spheres centered at the atomic positions .",

    "= ti , v , cr , mn the fermi energy e@xmath7 lies in the pronounced gap of the minority - spin states ( left side panels ) , determining the half - metal character of these compounds . according to fig.[fig1]b the width of the band gap has values in the range of 0.6 to 0.7  ev .",
    "the heusler alloy co@xmath0fesi , however , is not a half - metal anymore , because e@xmath7 falls into an uprising peak of the minority - spin states .",
    "the -now indirect- band gap is only 0.1 ev wide , being strongly reduced due to a flat tail of the mentioned peak ( see corresponding left side panel ) . for the half - metal compounds , however , this pronounced peak is totally unoccupied . for m",
    "= co , ni the gap vanishes , because all the d - bands are nearly filled and the separation of the co - d and m - d band center is now too small for the formation of a gap .",
    "the crucial gap for the half - metal compounds , as discussed by galanakis et al . for co@xmath0mnsi @xcite , is due to a strong hybridization between co - d and m - d states , combined with large local magnetic moments and a sizeable separation of the d - like band centers .",
    "we found that a related strong hybridization feature ( a small gap for m = ti , v or a deep valley for m = cr , mn , fe ) occurs already in the non - spin polarized dos , for which e@xmath7 cuts through a pronounced peak indicating instabiliy . when allowing for ferromagnetic spin polarization the fermi energy",
    "is then pinned in the gap of the minority - spin dos as long as there are not too many states to be filled and the gap is sufficiently large , which is the case for the compounds with m = ti , v , cr , mn . in these cases , the local magnetic moments @xmath12 of the m - atoms increase",
    "linearly , whereas @xmath13 remains rather constant ( see fig.[fig1]c ) .",
    "it should be noted , that the numerical values of the local moments depend on the choice of the localization criterion ( e.g. on the choice of radii of atomic spheres in our case ) , and therefore -in general- they are not integer numbers .",
    "however , the total magnetic moments @xmath14 are exactly integer numbers for the true half - metal compounds , as shown by table  [ tab1 ] .    .results of vasp calculations with gga potentials : magnetic moments ( total moment @xmath14 in @xmath2/f.u .",

    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparing co@xmath0mnsi to co@xmath0fesi , the local moment @xmath19 is now smaller than @xmath20 , and the linear trend for @xmath12 ( for m = ti , v , cr , mn ) is now destroyed , as shown by fig.[fig1]c .",
    "the reason is that according to a conventional dft gga calculation co@xmath0fesi is not a half metal .",
    "this is consistent with a recent dft study by wurmehl _ et .",
    "@xcite , who also found that the fermi level is not in the band gap of the minority - spin dos when applying gga or the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation potential . treating the d - states as strongly localized states by means of an lda+u approach and choosing suitable parameters for u - j  @xcite , the compound co@xmath0fesi became a half - metal with a local moment of 6  @xmath2 in agreement to experiment .",
    "we reproduced the lda+u results which can also be obtained from conventional gga calculations for a volume which is expanded by 5% compared to the calculated equilibrium value .",
    "it should also be mentioned that in the case of co@xmath0mnsi , our results agree well with earlier dft studies.@xcite    according to our results , amongst the three predicted half metals co@xmath0msi ( m = ti , v , cr ) the cr compound is the most interesting one , because of its large density of states of the majority spins at fermi energy of n(@xmath15,e@xmath7 ) = 0.80 states ev@xmath17 spin@xmath17 atom@xmath17 .",
    "this is the largest value for all known ferromagnetic half - metals .",
    "the reason for this large value is that the fermi energy cuts through strongly localized states of mostly cr - d like character , as illustrated by the band structure and d - like dos in fig .",
    "the contribution of co d - states to n(@xmath15,e@xmath7 ) is very small , because e@xmath21 falls into a deep minimum of e@xmath22 as well as t@xmath23 states .",
    "according to this finding , co@xmath0crsi is a half - metal which offers 100% spin - selectivity combined with a pronounced site selectivity of strongly localized cr states at e@xmath21 .",
    "this is in contrast to the well - known half - metals co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0fesi , for which the states at e@xmath21 are of more delocalized character .",
    "the curie temperatures @xmath24 for co@xmath0msi ( m = ti , v , cr ) were estimated similar to a model presented in ref .   by applying the relation @xmath25 , which is linear in the total magnetic moment @xmath14 per unit cell .",
    "the results are 385 , 566 , and 747 k for co@xmath0tisi , co@xmath0vsi , and co@xmath0crsi , respectively .",
    "again , the cr compound is of special interest , now because of its rather large @xmath24 , making it interesting for technological applications .",
    "because the cr d - states at e@xmath21 are strongly localized one might argue that these states have to be treated in a more suitable way e.g. in terms of the lda+u approach as described previously for the study of co@xmath0fesi . in our case",
    ", we applied the approach of dudarev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which needs only the difference @xmath26 of the on - site coulomb and exchange parameters .",
    "similar to the study wurmehl _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite we chose @xmath27  ev for co , whereas for cr @xmath28 was varied between 0 and 3  ev .",
    "( the choice of @xmath29 corresponds to the conventional gga calculation . ) for @xmath30  ev , co@xmath0crsi is still a half - metal with a strongly increased gap for the minority spin states of 1.9  ev however , for @xmath31  ev the fermi energy cuts through minority spin states , and the half - metal character is destroyed .",
    "the main effects of the localization enforced by the lda+u treatment are an increased gap width and the occupation of more majority spin states than for the conventional gga or lda approaches which lowers the fermi energy .",
    "this lowering effect could be so strong ( i.e. for larger @xmath28 ) , that finally e@xmath21 cuts through minority spin states below the gap .",
    "the applied lda+u approach has the advantage , that only one unknown parameter needs to be introduced , namely the difference of u minus j. most of the other lda+u approaches ( e.g. ref  ) rely on the two independent parameters u and j. a suitable choice of these parameters is -however- at present not possible , because no experimental information is yet available . for co@xmath0crsi",
    "being a half - metal or not , more elaborate calculations might be necessary to determine either the unknown parameters , or to go beyond the limitations of the lda+u approaches .",
    "crsi : spin polarized band structure ( upper panel ) and projected density of states ( lower panel ) .",
    "[ fig2],title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] +    measurements of the magnetic and electronic properties of co@xmath0crsi would give the answer .",
    "however , the preparation of suitable samples is not straightforward , because co@xmath0crsi is thermodynamically metastable .",
    "( in contrast to co@xmath0tisi and co@xmath0vsi , which are even known to exist thermodynamically . )",
    "according to our _ ab initio _ calculations of the enthalpy of formation , the compound co@xmath0crsi is unstable against a thermodynamical separation into the phases co@xmath0si , cr and si by 3  kj ( mol of atoms)@xmath17 . on the other hand , co@xmath0crsi is stable against decompositions into co@xmath4si , cr and si ( by 23  kj ( mol of atoms)@xmath17 ) , cosi , cr and si ( by 6kj ) , and co , cr , si ( by 29.7 kj ) . obviously , co@xmath0crsi might be stabilized by advanced experimental techniques for synthesizing metastable states .",
    "elastically , however , the cr compound is very stable as demonstrated by the calculated elastic constants of c@xmath32=297  gpa , c@xmath33=193  gpa , and c@xmath34=145  gpa , and the bulk modulus of b=227  gpa ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the calculated lattice parameters listed in table [ tab3 ] for the known ti- , v- , mn- , and fe - based half - metals are -as expected- in good agreement to experiment .",
    "@xcite in this table , enthalpies of formations are also given .",
    "in particular , non spinpolarized ( nm ) calcualtions are compared to ferromagnetic ( fm ) calculations , which result in significant energy gains , in particular for the cr- , fe- , and mn - based alloys .",
    "the calculated elastic constants are given by table [ tab2 ] , which show no anomolous behaviour .",
    "in particular , the co@xmath0crsi alloy fits in the trend of the other compounds , and is certainly elastically stable .",
    "( for co@xmath0cosi and co@xmath0nisi with their assumed artificial structures the derived shear moduli @xmath35 are negative , indicating elastic instability ) .",
    "summarizing , based on density functional calculations we predict three ferromagnetic half - metals , namely co@xmath0tisi , co@xmath0vsi , and co@xmath0crsi .",
    "the cr compound is of particular interest because of its high density of states of 100% polarized states at fermi energy together with a strong selectivity of cr - d states and an elevated curie temperature .",
    "we hope that our work stimulates experiments on co@xmath0crsi once this metastable phase could be synthesized .",
