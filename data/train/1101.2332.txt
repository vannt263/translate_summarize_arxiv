    "infinite periodic structures do not support wave propagation in certain frequency intervals known as stop bands ( band gaps ) @xcite . for finite arrays of periodically arranged scatterers , referred to as sonic crystals , the stop bands correspond to the frequency intervals of very low transmission @xcite .",
    "the position of the stop bands can be tuned to selected frequency intervals by changing the spacing between the scatterers .",
    "this makes sonic crystals attractive for applications as noise barriers particularly for narrow band sources .",
    "the performance of the sonic crystals can be improved by increasing the filling fraction @xcite , varying the arrangement of the scatterers @xcite and also by replacing the scatterers with the resonant elements @xcite .",
    "the latter allows increasing insertion loss in the low - frequency range if the resonant frequencies of the scatterers lie below the first stop band associated with the array periodicity .",
    "the most obvious choice for such resonant elements are split ring resonators @xcite which essentially are 2d helmholtz resonators .",
    "alternatively an array of thin elastic shells in air has been shown to possess strong multiple resonances in the low - frequency range @xcite .",
    "arrays of composite scatterers such as concentric split ring resonators @xcite are shown to support band gaps generated by the multiple resonances of each scatterer in the array . in this paper",
    "we investigate the concentric arrangement of two types of the resonant elements i.e. thin elastic shells and split ring resonators with multiple slits , referred to as n - slit cylinders .",
    "these composite scatterers , referred to as composites , serve a double purpose .",
    "first , they support multiple resonances including helmholtz and annular cavity resonances and also axisymmetric resonance of the elastic shells .",
    "the latter is defined by the geometry of the shell and not by the area of the cavity that therefore gives advantage in tuning of the composite multiple resonant behaviour compared to that for the concentric split ring resonators .",
    "it is also shown that the coupling between two resonators leads to the shift of the axisymmetric shell resonance to the lower frequency range . the analogous effect for coupled mechanical oscillator ( multiple degree of freedom system )",
    "is well known @xcite .",
    "second , for the purpose of creating a noise barrier an array of elastic shells exposed to the environment would not be practical . a simple solution is to protect the shells by using outer cylinders containing slits surrounding inner elastic shells arranged concentrically .",
    "the scattering problem for the hollow cylinder with non - uniform boundaries has been solved semi - analytically in @xcite and references therein .",
    "this involves solving the linear algebraic system of equations derived from the analytical evaluation of the integral equations .",
    "an alternative approach has been developed in grating theory @xcite where solution of the studied partial differential equations is subject to the boundary conditions dependent on the coordinates .",
    "three configurations involving the n - slit cylinder are studied in this paper ( a ) alone , ( b ) concentric with an inner rigid cylinder and ( c ) concentric with an inner elastic shell . to solve the scattering problem for n - slit cylinders we use boundary conditions dependent on polar angle @xcite . in section [ ss ] this approach is employed to solve a single composite scatterer problem that is similar to that solved for an electromagnetic case @xcite .",
    "however in the present model the finite thickness of the wall of the n - slit cylinder is taken into account .",
    "this avoids the use of adjustable parameters introduced for numerical stability @xcite and provides a more accurate description of the real structure used in the experiments reported later . the solution inside slits is replaced by jump conditions @xcite that describe the slit interface as a moving piston .",
    "it should be noted that use of jump conditions to replace the slits makes it possible to accurately predict the total wave field in the low- and mid - frequency range .",
    "it is also shown that in the low - frequency range the slit cylinder can be replaced by an equivalent fluid layer .",
    "the approximations are based on the results derived for the perforated plate @xcite .",
    "the developed approximations are of particular interest for studying the low - frequency resonant behaviour of the single composite arrangement and a finite periodic array of them .",
    "this behaviour is attributed to the helmholtz - like resonances with wavelength much bigger than the characteristic sizes of the cylinder ( i.e. radius and width of the slits ) .",
    "experimental validation of the analytical and numerical predictions has been carried out .",
    "in particular the results obtained with the grating theory are compared with the low - frequency approximations for the cylinders with different number of slits and various inner structure ( n - slit cylinder alone , rigid core and elastic shell core ) .",

    "the versatility of the proposed method can be applied to various type of 2d resonators with concentric multilayered / solid cylinder inner .",
    "it has been found theoretically and experimentally that increasing the number of slits in an empty pipe causes an increase in the frequency of the helmhotz - type resonance . a low frequency approximation which models",
    "the slit cylinder by an equivalent fluid layer predicts that the frequency increase is proportional to the square root of the number of slits and this has been confirmed experimentally .",
    "the concentric arrangements result in resonances associated with both circular and annular cavities . with an inner elastic shell ,",
    "an additional axisymmetric resonance of the shell is preserved but modified by the presence of the outer 4-slit pipe .",
    "coupling between the components of the concentric arrangement results in shifts in the resonant frequencies corresponding to each element of the composite configuration .",
    "this is similar to the effect that is observed in mass - spring systems with multiple degrees of freedom .",
    "a low frequency approximation for the acoustical properties of the concentric arrangement with an elastic shell inner correctly predicts the observed frequency shift in the axisymmetric resonance .",
    "when used in periodic arrays the concentric arrangements with inner elastic shells and outer 4-slit cylinders result in additional sound attenuation in the low - frequency range below the first bragg band gap while still preserving the bragg band gaps .",
    "this arrangement is more practical that the use of unprotected elastic shells so is potentially useful basis for a sonic crystal barrier design .",
