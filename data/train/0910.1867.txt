    "we first present a short introduction to the soft gluon @xmath0-resummation technique , then the main features of our eikonal model based on qcd - minijet cross section and soft gluon resummation , after which we compare our results with data from @xmath4 and @xmath5 processes .",
    "finally , we show how the @xmath0-resummation affects the asymptotic rise which , while respecting the fm bound , does not necessarily saturate it .",
    "to compute the total cross - section one has to integrate over large values of the impact parameters @xmath6 , which gets linked to the ir regions of the underlying partonic processes .",
    "here we are considering ( within a semiclassical approach ) soft gluon emissions from the colliding partons and their @xmath0-resummation , whose fourier transforms we assume to describe the matter distribution within the colliding hadrons .",

    "@xcite one splits this expression in two terms @xmath9 with the first term parameterizing the infrared behavior and the second term which is calculable in the perturbative regime defined as @xmath10   { { dk_t}\\over{k_t } }    \\ln {    { { 2m}\\over{k_t}}}.\\ ] ] since this integral only runs down to a scale @xmath11 , one uses the asymptotic freedom expression for @xmath3 and one assumes that @xmath12 oscillates to zero . in the range",
