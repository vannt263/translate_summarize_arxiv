    "<S> we review the basic field - theoretic and phenomenological features of the recently introduced minimal nonminimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mnssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the introduced model is the simplest and most economic version among the proposed nonminimal supersymmetric models , in which the so - called @xmath0-problem can be successfully addressed . </S>",
    "<S> as opposed to the mssm and the frequently - discussed nmssm , the mnssm can naturally predict the existence of a light charged higgs boson with a mass smaller than 100  gev . </S>",
    "<S> such a possible realization of the higgs sector can be soon be tested at the upgraded run ii phase of the tevatron collider .    </S>",
    "<S> mc - th-2002 - 08 + hep - ph/0210266 + october 2002    it is known that minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mssm ) suffers from the so called @xmath0-problem . </S>",
    "<S> the superpotential of the mssm contains a bilinear term @xmath1 involving the two higgs - doublet superfields @xmath2 and @xmath3 , known as the @xmath0-term . </S>",
    "<S> naive implementation of the @xmath0-parameter within supergravity theories would lead to a @xmath0 value of the order of the planck scale @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a successful higgs mechanism at the electroweak scale , the @xmath0-parameter is actually required to be many orders of magnitude smaller of order @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> many scenarios , all based on extensions of the mssm , have been proposed in the existing literature  @xcite to provide a natural explanation for the origin of the @xmath0-term .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a minimal extension of the mssm has been presented  @xcite , called the minimal nonminimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mnssm )  @xcite , in which the @xmath0-problem can be successfully addressed in a rather minimal way . in the mnssm the @xmath0-parameter </S>",
    "<S> is promoted to a chiral singlet superfield @xmath6 , and all linear , quadratic and cubic operators involving only @xmath6 are absent from the renormalizable superpotential ; @xmath6 enters through the single term @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the superpotential of the mssm without the presence of the @xmath0 term . the crucial difference between the mnssm and the frequently - discussed next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( nmssm )  @xcite lies in the fact that the cubic term @xmath10 does not appear in the renormalizable superpotential of the former .    the key point in the construction of the renormalizable mnssm superpotential </S>",
    "<S> is that the simple form  ( [ wren ] ) may be enforced by discrete @xmath11-symmetries , such as @xmath12  @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these discrete @xmath11-symmetries , however , must be extended to the gravity - induced non - renormalizable superpotential and khler potential terms as well . to communicate the breaking of supersymmetry ( susy ) </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the scenario of @xmath14 supergravity spontaneously broken by a set of hidden - sector fields at an intermediate scale . within this framework of susy - breaking </S>",
    "<S> , we have then been able to show  @xcite that the above @xmath11-symmetries are sufficient to postpone the appearance of the potentially dangerous tadpole  @xcite  @xmath15 at a loop level @xmath16 higher than 5 , where @xmath17 from this last expression , one can estimate that the size of the tadpole parameter @xmath18 is in the right ballpark , i.e.  @xmath1910  tev@xmath20 for @xmath21 , such that the gauge hierarchy does not get destabilized . to be specific , the tadpole @xmath15 together with the soft susy - breaking mass term @xmath22 lead to a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , of order @xmath25  tev . </S>",
    "<S> the latter gives rise to a @xmath0-parameter at the required electroweak scale , i.e.@xmath26 thus , a natural explanation for the origin of the @xmath0-parameter can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> finally , since the effective tadpole term @xmath27 explicitly breaks the continuous peccei  </S>",
    "<S> quinn symmetry governing the remaining renormalizable lagrangian of the mnssm , the theory naturally avoids the presence of a phenomenologically excluded weak - scale axion .    </S>",
    "<S> = 19.5 cm    in addition to the tadpole @xmath18 of the physical scalar @xmath23 , an effective tadpole for its auxiliary component @xmath28 is generated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , depending on the underlying mechanism of susy breaking , the effective tadpole proportional to @xmath28 could in principle be absent from the model . </S>",
    "<S> such a reduction of the renormalizable operators does not thwart the renormalizability of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting renormalizable low - energy scenario has one parameter less than the frequently - discussed nmssm with the cubic singlet - superfield term @xmath29 present ; it therefore represents the most economic , renormalizable version among the non - minimal supersymmetric models proposed in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> as opposed to the nmssm , the mnssm satisfies the tree - level mass sum rule  @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the three cp - even and two cp - odd higgs fields , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the tree - level mass sum rule  ( [ sumrule ] ) is very analogous to the corresponding one of the mssm @xcite , where the two heavier higgs states @xmath33 and @xmath34 are absent in the latter . </S>",
    "<S> this striking analogy to the mssm allows us to advocate that the higgs sector of the mnssm differs indeed minimally from the one of the mssm , i.e.  the introduced model truly constitutes the minimal supersymmetric extension of the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> in the nmssm , the violation of the mass sum rule  ( [ sumrule ] ) can become much larger than the one induced by the one - loop stop / top effects , especially for relatively large values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    in the non - minimal supersymmetric standard models , the upper bound on the lightest cp </S>",
    "<S> - even higgs - boson mass @xmath38 has a tree - level dependence on the coupling @xmath39  @xcite , i.e. @xmath40 where the angle @xmath41 is defined by means of @xmath42 , the ratio of the vevs of the two higgs doublets . </S>",
    "<S> since in the mnssm @xmath39 can take its maximum allowed value naturally corresponding to the nmssm with @xmath43  @xcite , the value of @xmath38 is predicted to be the highest . in particular , a renormalization - group - improved analysis  @xcite of the effective mnssm higgs potential leads to the upper bound : @xmath44  gev , for large stop mixing ( see also fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , such a scenario can only be decisively tested by the upgraded run ii phase of the tevatron collider at fermilab and by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .    </S>",
    "<S> = 19.5 cm    = 19.5 cm    the mnssm can comfortably predict viable scenarios , where the mass of the charged higgs boson @xmath45 is in the range : 80  gev  @xmath46  3  tev , for phenomenologically relevant values of @xmath47 gev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as can be seen from  fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , there is an absolute upper bound on @xmath48 for fixed values of @xmath39 and @xmath49 .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> charged higgs - boson masses smaller than 100  gev can naturally be obtained within the mnssm , while the sm - like higgs boson @xmath50 , with dominant coupling to the @xmath51 boson , can be heavier than about 115  gev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> instead , both in the mssm and the nmssm  @xcite , such a higgs - boson mass spectrum is theoretically inaccessible , if the phenomenologically favoured range @xmath52 gev is considered . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , we display numerical values for the masses of the lightest and next - to - lightest higgs bosons , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and their couplings to the @xmath51 boson as functions of @xmath0 , for a number of versions of the mnssm that predict light charged higgs bosons . in the mnssm versions under study , </S>",
    "<S> the sm - like higgs boson @xmath50 ( mainly @xmath54 ) can have a mass larger 110  gev , compatible with the present experimental bound . </S>",
    "<S> the generic prediction is that the first cp - even higgs boson @xmath53 is lighter than @xmath54 and has a suppressed coupling to the @xmath51 boson in agreement with lep2 data . from figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] , we observe that the charged higgs boson can be as light as the present experimental upper bound , i.e.  @xmath55  gev . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important phenomenological feature of the mnssm , which is very helpful to discriminate it from the nmssm . </S>",
    "<S> it is a reflection of a new non - trivial decoupling limit due to a large tadpole @xmath56 , which is only attainable in the mnssm  @xcite . in this limit , </S>",
    "<S> the heavier higgs states @xmath57 and @xmath58 can both decouple from the higgs spectrum as a heavy singlets . the upcoming upgraded run  ii phase of the tevatron collider has the physics potential to probe the viability of a light - charged - higgs - boson realization .    for scenarios with @xmath59 gev , the distinction between the mnssm and the nmssm becomes more difficult . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , additional experimental information would be necessary to distinguish the two susy extensions of the mssm , resulting from a precise determination of the masses , the widths , the branching ratios and the production cross sections of the cp - even and cp - odd higgs bosons . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , if the tadpole parameter @xmath60 becomes much larger than @xmath61 with the remaining kinematic parameters held fixed , the higgs states @xmath33 and @xmath34 will be predominantly singlets . as an important phenomenological consequence of this , the complementarity relations between the @xmath62- and @xmath63- couplings </S>",
    "<S> will then hold approximately true in the mnssm , i.e. @xmath64 in addition , the couplings of the two heaviest states @xmath33 and @xmath34 to the gauge bosons will vanish . here , we should stress that the relations  ( [ compl ] ) are not generically valid in the nmssm . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is a consequence of the absence of the aforementioned large tadpole decoupling limit , such that the states @xmath33 and @xmath34 could decouple as singlets . </S>",
    "<S> future next linear @xmath65 colliders have the capabilities to experimentally determine the @xmath62- and @xmath63- couplings to an accuracy even up to 3% and so test , to a high degree , the complementarity relations  ( [ compl ] ) which are an essential phenomenological feature of the mnssm .    as has been discussed in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the mnssm also predicts the existence of a light neutralino , the axino . </S>",
    "<S> the axino is predominantly a singlet field , for @xmath66 gev . </S>",
    "<S> lep limits on the @xmath51-boson invisible width lead to the additional constraint : @xmath67 gev , for @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> . however , such a constraint disappears completely for smaller values of @xmath39 , namely for @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the axino may become the lightest supersymmetric particle , which is very long - lived in the mnssm , and hence it potentially qualifies as a candidate for cold dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we feel that a dedicated study in this direction needs to be done .    </S>",
    "<S> let us summarize the basic field - theoretic and phenomenological features of the mnssm : ( i ) the mnssm minimally departs from the mssm through the presence of a gauge - singlet superfield whose all self - couplings are absent . </S>",
    "<S> on the basis of discrete @xmath11 symmetries , such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the quadratically divergent harmful tadpoles first appear at the 6- and 7-loop levels , thereby avoiding to destabilize the gauge hierarchy . by the same token , </S>",
    "<S> the mnssm can minimally account for the origin of @xmath0-term ; </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) since the loop - induced tadpoles break any continuous or discrete symmetry , the model does not suffer from problems  @xcite related to visible weak - scale axions and domain walls ; ( iii ) as a consequence of a new decoupling limit due to a large tadpole , the mnssm can naturally predict viable scenarios in which the charged higgs boson @xmath45 is much lighter than the neutral higgs boson with a sm - type coupling to the @xmath51 boson . </S>",
    "<S> the planned colliders , i.e.  the upgraded tevatron collider  @xcite and the lhc , have the potential capabilities to test such interesting scenarios with a relatively light @xmath45 ; ( iv ) unlike the frequently - discussed nmssm , the higgs sector of the mnssm exhibits a much closer resemblance to the one of the mssm , by means of the tree - level mass sum rule  ( [ sumrule ] ) and the complementarity relations  ( [ compl ] ) of the higgs - boson couplings to the @xmath51 boson </S>",
    "<S> .    in conclusion , all the above facts point to a single perspective : the only truly minimal supersymmetric extension of the mssm is the minimal nonminimal supersymmetric standard model . </S>"
