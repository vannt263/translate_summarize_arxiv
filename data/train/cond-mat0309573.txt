    "for a long time , it has been believed that the spin glass ( sg ) phase is realized in three dimensions ( @xmath9 ) for the ising model@xcite but not for the xy and heisenberg models.@xcite thus the sg phases observed in experiments were suggested to be realized due to anisotropy.@xcite however , numerical studies in the last decade have revealed that the sg phase might be more stable than what has been believed so far . in a long - range ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky )",
    "model , it was shown that the sg susceptibility exhibits a divergent singularity at a finite temperature , even when the anisotropy is absent.@xcite this behavior has been attributed to the randomness of the spin position ( site random model ) rather than the long - range nature of the rkky interaction .",
    "in fact , a short - range site random model composed of ferromagnetic spins and antiferromagnetic spins was shown to exhibit a long - range order phase characterized by the co - existence of a ferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic orders.@xcite on the other hand , for the xy and heisenberg bond sg models , kawamura and his coworkers took notice of chiralities of the spins and showed that a chiral glass ( cg ) phase transition occurs at a finite temperature @xmath10 , but the spin glass phase is still absent.@xcite they insisted that an anisotropy mixes the chiral freedom and the spin freedom and the sg phase transition occurs at @xmath11 .",
    "this view of the sg phase transition is quite attractive , because it gives a novel picture of the sg phase .",
    "that is , in the picture , the cg phase realizes in the real world , not the sg phase .",
    "however , their bases of the absence of the sg phase are obscure . moreover , since the chirality is described by the spin variables , then the origin of the cg phase transition might be the usual sg phase transition .",
    "in fact , recent studies of the aging effects of the spin and the chirality autocorrelation functions@xcite and the developments of the sg and the cg susceptibilities@xcite by means of a nonequilibrium relaxation method suggested that , if the cg phase transition occurs , the sg phase transition occurs at the same transition temperature @xmath12 .",
    "quite recently , lee and young presented the same conclusion using a finite size analysis of the correlation length of the spins and chiralities.@xcite    during the last decade , new algorithms for simulating the complex systems have developed and available computer power has increased enormously .",
    "it is therefore possible to reexamine in detail the sg phase transition of the heisenberg model on the base of usual analyses .",
    "here we consider heisenberg models with and without random anisotropy on a simple cubic lattice described by @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the heisenberg spin of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is its @xmath17-component @xmath18 , and @xmath19 runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs .",
    "the exchange interaction @xmath20 takes on either @xmath21 or @xmath22 with the same probability of 1/2 .",
    "we assume that the anisotropy comes from pseudo - dipolar couplings and impose the restriction @xmath23 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath24 are uniform random values between @xmath25 and @xmath1 .",
    "evidences of the absence of the sg phase in the heisenberg sg model which have been believed so far are the following two points .    1",
    ".   negative stiffness exponent @xmath3 at @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite 2 .   scaling plots of the sg susceptibility @xmath27 and absence of the crossing of the binder ratio @xmath28.@xcite    then we reexamine these two points to consider the possibility of the sg phase transition of the heisenberg sg model",
    ". we will consider stiffness exponent @xmath3 at @xmath26 and @xmath29 in section 2 , and properties of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in section 3",
    ". we will give a special attention on the effect of the anisotropy , because it has been believed that the anisotropy brings the sg phase transition .",
    "so if it is true , we will find different properties between the models with and without the anisotropy .",
    "the most accepted evidence of the absence of the sg phase is results of the defect energy method .",
    "so we first consider the defect energy method .",
    "the defect energy method comes from an application of a renormalization - group idea.@xcite that is , one evaluates an effective coupling @xmath30 between block spins of the linear dimension @xmath31 generated by the renormalization .",
    "the effective coupling @xmath30 would depend on @xmath31 as @xmath32 with @xmath3 being called as the stiffness exponent .",
    "when @xmath4 , the sg phase transition occurs at a finite temperature , while no phase transition occurs at any finite temperature when @xmath33 . to estimate @xmath30 ,",
    "one considers the domain wall energy @xmath34 which is defined as the difference in the ground state energy of two lattices a and b of size @xmath35 with the same bond distribution but with different boundary conditions .",
    "that is , for the lattice a , a periodic boundary condition is applied for every direction , and , for the lattice b , an antiperiodic boundary condition is applied for one direction and the periodic boundary condition for the other directions . by using the method , banavar and cieplak firstly estimated the value of @xmath36 and predicted that the sg phase transition occurs at @xmath26.@xcite successive studies also predicted negative values for @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath37@xcite and @xmath38.@xcite    recently , however , a doubt was thrown to the estimation of @xmath30.@xcite that is , in the calculation of @xmath34 , one expects that no domain wall exists in the lattice a(or b ) and hence one domain wall arises in the lattice b(or a ) . this expectation might be true , but another possibility would be equally true .",
    "that is , some domain wall will occur in the lattice a and some different domain wall in the lattice b. then one might examine merely difference in the energy between those two domain walls .",
    "does this defect energy @xmath34 really gives the effective coupling @xmath30 between the block spins ? so we first examine @xmath34 of the model with and without random anisotropy .",
    "we calculate @xmath34 for lattices of @xmath39 , and for each @xmath31 , the sample averages are taken over about 4000 independent bond realizations .",
    "results of @xmath40 $ ] are presented in fig.1 in a log - log form , where @xmath41 $ ] means the sample average .",
    "data for @xmath5 are curved .",
    "the most surprising thing is that this @xmath31 dependence of @xmath40 $ ] is similar to those in the case of @xmath42 .",
    "these results suggest two possibilities .",
    "one is that , a finite size effect is so large that the asymptotic region has not yet been reached . since the curvature is upwards , it is possible that @xmath43 or even more @xmath4 in the limit of @xmath44 . the other is the inadequateness for estimating the defect energy as pointed out above . in order to examine the latter possibility , we study this problem in a different method .",
    "= 0.7      apart from the renormalization - group concept , we consider the stability of the spin configuration of the system itself.@xcite the strategy of our examination is as follows.@xcite we prepare a cubic lattice of @xmath45 with an open boundary condition in one direction of @xmath46 lattice sites ( z - direction ) and the periodic boundary conditions in the other directions .",
    "that is , the lattice has two surfaces @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we call this system the reference system .",
    "first we determine the ground state spin configuration of the reference system .",
    "hereafter , the ground state spin configurations on @xmath47 and @xmath48 are denoted as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . in this spin configuration , any distortion ( domain - wall ) in the z - direction will be removed , because the lattice has free surfaces @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "then we add a distortion inside the system in the manner that @xmath49 are fixed and @xmath50 are changed under the condition that the relative angles between the spins are fixed .",
    "the ground state energy of this system is always higher than that of the reference system . when @xmath5 , this excess energy is the net one added inside the reference system , because the surface energy of @xmath48 , which is given as the sum of the exchange energies between the spins on @xmath48 , is conserved .",
    "we consider the stability of the system on the basis of this excess energy .",
    "one might think that the fixing of the relative spin directions on @xmath47 and @xmath48 overestimates the stability of the spin configuration .",
    "we think , however , that this restriction is not serious for discussing the stability , because the increase of the excess energy to infinity for @xmath51 means nothing but the existence of a strong correlation between the spin configurations on @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , the same method was successfully applied to the ising sg model in @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite    we calculate two kinds of excess energies .",
    "one is the excess energy which is gained by rotating @xmath50 by the same angle @xmath53 around some common axis ( z - axis ) and the other is the excess energy which is gained by reversing @xmath50 .",
    "hereafter , we call the former system the rotated system and the latter system the reversed system .",
    "we think that it is sufficient to examine these two excess energies for considering the stiffness , because we can change @xmath50 into any direction by combining the rotation and the reversal .",
    "the excess energy for the rotation @xmath54 and that for the reversion @xmath55 are given as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the ground state energy of the reference system , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the ground state energies of the rotated system and reversed system , respectively .",
    "the lattice sizes studied here are @xmath60 and , for each @xmath31 , the sample averages are taken over about 1000 independent bond realizations .    in fig.2 , we present @xmath31-dependence of @xmath61 $ ] . here",
    "we show data only for @xmath5 , because in the case of @xmath42 we could hardly evaluate the net excess energy of @xmath61$].@xcite we clearly see that the data increase with @xmath31 . from the slope of the asymptotic line shown in the figure , we tentatively determine the value of the stiffness exponent as @xmath62 .",
    "that is , the sg phase would not be destroyed by a rotational perturbation .    in fig.3 , we present @xmath31-dependences of @xmath63 $ ] for both @xmath5 and @xmath42 .",
    "data depend little on the value @xmath1 . for each of @xmath1 s ,",
    "they seem to lie on a curve with a common positive slope of @xmath64 . again , we get the view that the sg phase is stable at @xmath65 for both @xmath66 and @xmath5 .",
    "= 0.8    = 0.8    our results suggest @xmath67 for both @xmath5 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , their values are somewhat different with each other .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that these values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 may vary for @xmath44 , because in the lattice size range studied here @xmath61 $ ] is smaller than @xmath63 $ ] and the former increases more rapidly than the latter ( @xmath70 ) , then as @xmath31 increases further they would come close with each other .",
    "the convincing values of @xmath69 and @xmath68 would be given in that range of @xmath31 .",
    "unfortunately , the lattice sizes are still small to examine this speculation . any way , both the analyses of @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath63 $ ] suggest that the system tends to be _ rigid _ as the size of the lattice becomes larger .",
    "note that we have also calculated the defect energies of the system for @xmath5 using two replica boundary conditions@xcite and found that they also increase with similar , positive slopes of @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the @xmath73 rotation around the @xmath74-axis and the reversion , respectively.@xcite hence , we conclude that _ the defect energy method never gives evidence of the phase transition at @xmath75_.    = 0.8    what is the sg phase transition temperature @xmath76 ?",
    "we may estimate @xmath76 by calculating the excess free energy @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78$]@xcite at finite temperatures .",
    "in fact , we have also calculated these quantities for @xmath5.@xcite the result of @xmath78 $ ] is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that , at high temperatures @xmath79 $ ] decreases with increasing @xmath31 , whereas at low temperatures they increase with @xmath31 .",
    "one estimates the phase transition temperature from the crossing temperature of the free energies for various lattice sizes @xmath31 . in the present model , the crossing temperature @xmath80 for the lattice sizes @xmath31 and @xmath81 shifts systematically to the low temperature side with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "then , we assumed that @xmath80 decreases linearly with @xmath82 , and estimated @xmath80 for @xmath44 as @xmath83 .",
    "note that the same extrapolation for @xmath84 $ ] gave @xmath85 .",
    "therefore we may conclude that , if the sg phase transition occurs , the transition temperature is @xmath6 .",
    "now we reexamine the sg phase transition itself . here",
    "we consider the model on a simple cubic lattice of @xmath86 with skew boundary conditions along two @xmath31 directions and a periodic boundary condition along the @xmath46 direction .",
    "we perform a mc simulation of the two - replica systems of the spins @xmath87 and @xmath88 using an exchange mc algorithm@xcite .",
    "we calculate the order - parameter probability distribution @xmath89 of @xmath90,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and [ @xmath92 mean the thermal average and the bond distribution average , respectively . here",
    "@xmath93 is the spin overlap defined by @xmath94 with @xmath95 . using @xmath89",

    "we examine the size and temperature dependences of these quantities both for @xmath5 and for @xmath42 .",
    "the linear sizes of the lattice studied here are @xmath99 .",
    "equilibration is checked by monitoring the stability of the results against at least two - times longer runs .",
    "the numbers of the samples are 480 for @xmath100 , 192 for @xmath101 , 96 for @xmath102 , and 48 for @xmath103 .",
    "= 0.7    in fig . 5",
    ", we show results of sg susceptibility @xmath7 of the model without the anisotropy ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "as the temperature is decreased , @xmath7 for larger @xmath31 increases rapidly . if the lower critical dimension @xmath104 is less than the lattice dimension , @xmath105 , and the phase transition really occurs at @xmath106 , the data for different @xmath31 will be scaled as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the exponent of the correlation length and @xmath109 is the exponent which describes the decay of the correlation function at @xmath106 .",
    "the scaling plots obtained by assuming @xmath110 and @xmath75 are shown in fig .",
    "the scaling with @xmath110 works better than that with @xmath75 , even if the data for the smallest size @xmath111 are ignored in the latter.@xcite note that in the previous scaling analysis@xcite , @xmath75 was estimated using the data for lattice of @xmath112 . here",
    ", we use the data for a wider temperature range and add the data of the bigger lattice of @xmath113 . the phase transition temperature and the values of the critical exponent estimated here are @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "we should emphasize that this value of @xmath76 is in good agreement with that estimated from the excess free energy of @xmath117 .",
    "it is noted , however , that the possibility of @xmath75 is not ruled out from the scaling plot of fig .",
    "6(b ) , because in that case the temperature range of @xmath118 would be out of a critical region.@xcite as the anisotropy is added , the transition temperature increases with @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath119 for @xmath120 , and @xmath121 for @xmath122 .",
    "= 0.7    the binder parameter @xmath96 is the other quantity for examining the sg phase transition .",
    "it is believed that , if the sg phase transition occurs at @xmath76 , @xmath96 s for different @xmath31 cross at @xmath76 .",
    "contrary to our expectation , as shown in fig .",
    "7 , they neither cross nor come together at @xmath76 .",
    "this result seems to give the opposite view about the sg phase transition .",
    "however , the absence of the crossing of @xmath96 was also seen in the @xmath0 heisenberg model in four dimensions ( @xmath123)@xcite in which the sg phase transition is believed to occur at some finite temperature even when @xmath5.@xcite if the absence of the crossing of @xmath96 s for finite @xmath31 says nothing about the sg phase transition , the same would be true when the anisotropy is present ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "then , we also calculate the binder parameter of the model with @xmath66 . here ,",
    "since the system for @xmath66 has the inversion symmetry , we also consider the spin overlap of the diagonal components for which , in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath124 is used instead of @xmath93 .",

    "as @xmath1 is increased , this property becomes more prominent . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath128 exhibits _ a usual behavior_. that is , as the temperature is decreased , @xmath128 increases monotonically and its size dependence reverses .",
    "we suggest , hence , that the definition of the binder parameter in terms of @xmath125 is adequate for examining the phase transition for @xmath66 and its crossing behavior supports the presence of the phase transition .",
    "it is noted , however , that the crossing temperature seems to deviate considerably from that estimated above .",
    "we think that this deviation comes from a finite size effect , because the crossing temperatures for different @xmath31 s exhibit a considerable @xmath31 dependence and , as @xmath31 increases , it seems to approach @xmath76 .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath127 in the case of @xmath5 and found the absence of the crossing behavior .",
    "we think this difference in the behavior of @xmath127 comes from the occurrence of the drift of the whole system due to the @xmath129 symmetry for @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , the diagonal sg susceptibility @xmath130 for @xmath5 have been found to be much smaller than @xmath7 , whereas that for @xmath66 is larger than @xmath7.@xcite we believe , hence , that the absence of the crossing of the usual binder parameter @xmath96 will not say the absence of the phase transition of this system .",
    "we speculate that , even when @xmath5 , if the system becomes free from the drift , @xmath127 might exhibit a similar crossing behavior .",
    "= 0.7    = 0.7    recently , it was proposed that the quantities @xmath131 and @xmath132 that measure the order - parameter fluctuations ( opf ) exhibit the crossing behavior at @xmath76 even if @xmath96 does not:@xcite @xmath133 - [ \\langle q^2\\rangle]^2 }              { [ \\langle q^2\\rangle]^2 } ,    \\\\      g(l , t ) & = & \\frac{[\\langle q^2\\rangle^2 ]        - [ \\langle q^2\\rangle]^2}{[\\langle q^4\\rangle ] - [ \\langle q^2\\rangle]^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we also calculate @xmath131 and @xmath132 and examine their @xmath31-dependences . in fig . 9",
    ", we show @xmath132 for different @xmath31 at @xmath5 and @xmath120 . when @xmath5 , @xmath132 s for large @xmath134 seem to come together near @xmath76 .",
    "this property becomes more prominent in the anisotropic case of @xmath120 where the data for smaller @xmath135 join .",
    "we have also seen that @xmath131 for both @xmath5 and @xmath66 show a somewhat different crossing behaviors at a temperature a little higher than @xmath76 .",
    "we have reexamined the spin - glass ( sg ) phase transition of the @xmath0 heisenberg models with and without the random anisotropy @xmath1 in three dimensions ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "attentions have been paid on the results of ( i ) the defect energy method and ( ii ) the monte - carlo method , because the evidences of the absence of the sg phase transition at a finite temperature have been given by these two methods .",
    "our results have been summarized as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the stiffness exponent @xmath3 : we have shown that the previous result of @xmath33 is not convincing because of the two reasons , i.e. , ( a ) the meaning of the defect energy @xmath40 $ ] in the conventional method is not clear , and ( b ) even if the method is meaningful , the plot of @xmath40 $ ] as a function of @xmath31 curves considerably .",
    "we have proposed a new method which considers the stiffness of the lattice itself . by using the method ,",
    "we have shown that @xmath4 for @xmath66 and the same is true for @xmath5 .",
    "having considered the stiffness at finite temperatures , we have obtained the sg phase transition temperature @xmath6 for @xmath5 .",
    "\\(ii ) the monte carlo method : a large scale simulation have enabled us to make a scaling plot of the sg susceptibility @xmath7 which suggests the finite transiton temperature of @xmath8 for @xmath5 .",
    "the quantities @xmath132 and @xmath131 that measure the order - parameter fluctuations have exhibited a merging behavior near @xmath76 , but the binder parameter @xmath96 has not exhibited the usual crossing behavior .",
    "however , analyses of the model with @xmath66 have suggested that the absence of the crossing of @xmath96 s will not mean the absence of the sg order in this model .",
    "our results have focused that , in contrary to the common belief , the sg phase transition occurs at a finite temperature .",
    "it should be noted that the two different method have given almost the the same sg transition temperature of @xmath6 .",
    "this value of the transition temperature is very close to that estimated from nonequilibrium properties of the model , i.e. , @xmath6 from the aging effect of the spin autocorrelation function@xcite and @xmath136 from the nonequilibrium relaxation method@xcite .",
    "quite recently , lee and young@xcite studied the gaussian heisenberg model , and suggested @xmath137 .",
    "this value of the transition temperature is also reasonably close to our value , considering the difference of the bond distribution .",
    "hence we conclude that the model exhibits the sg phase transition even when the anisotropy is absent and its transition temperature is @xmath6 .",
    "we give two comments .",
    "one might think that , for a larger @xmath1 , the ising values of the exponents ( @xmath138@xcite , and @xmath139 and @xmath140@xcite ) should be recovered . however , we consider that this opinion is not necessarily true , because the random anisotropy in the model of eq.(1 ) is not uniaxial .",
    "of course , we could not rule out the possibility that a finite - size effect masks true values .",
    "the other comment is that the strange behavior of @xmath96 of the heisenberg sg model will come from the choice of the order parameter .",
    "when @xmath42 , the order parameter should be chosen as the sum of the diagonal components of the spin overlap , because only the inversion symmetry exists .",
    "we speculate that the same will be true in the isotropic case of @xmath5 , though the @xmath129 symmetry recovers . to examine this speculation",
