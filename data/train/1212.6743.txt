    "in quantum hall ( qh ) systems the charged bulk excitations are gapped , while gapless excitations exist at the edges.@xcite due to the quantization of kinetic energy under strong magnetic field , the physics of edge excitations depends on the interplay of electron - electron interaction and the confining potential .",
    "the different manners in which the two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is confined lead to rich electronic structures at the edges of the sample .",
    "the edge of a @xmath0 spinless qh liquid confined in a simple geometry by a sharp confining potential is described by the @xmath4 chiral fermi - liquid theory.@xcite with smoother confinement , the edge undergoes a _ charge reconstruction _ transition in which separated electronic lumps appear and bring new boundaries with even number , breaking the chirality.@xcite further including the spin freedom and with sufficiently weak zeeman splitting , hartree - fock ( hf ) technique shows that the charge reconstruction transition is pre - emptied by formation of edge spin texture.@xcite in fact closely related edge _ spin reconstruction _ was found for @xmath2 within hf approximation , in which a spin polarized strip is created along the edge and through which the edge undergoes a second - order spin - unpolarized to spin - polarized transition as the confining potential smoothes.@xcite the edge modes associated with this spin reconstruction of @xmath2 edge show up in nmr@xcite and momentum - resolved electron tunneling spectroscopy.@xcite still within hf approximation , barlas _",
    "et al._@xcite found that under sufficiently weak triangular confining potential , unpolarized @xmath2 state s spin - polarization transition is preceded by a charge reconstruction of a single spin species , creating a detached spin - polarized strip .",
    "this kind of edge structure are understood as a simultaneous edge _ charge and spin reconstruction_. it is these recent theoretical and in particular , experimental developments that motivated the present work , which go beyond earlier theoretical work@xcite in several aspects .",
    "first of all , earlier studies of integer qh edge instabilities and reconstructions were mostly based on hf approximation , and focused on the ground states only . in the present work",
    "we perform detailed exact diagonalization study on the same systems .",
    "in addition to obtaining the exact ground states , we also obtain the low - energy spectra of the system before instabilities occur , which provide deeper insight into the nature of the instabilities and the mechanisms of the corresponding edge reconstructions .    secondly , details of a qh liquid s edge structure may also depend on the detailed form of the confining potential .",
    "earlier works usually focus on one specific type of confining potential . in this paper",
    ", we consider a 2deg with disk geometry under three different types of confinement .",
    "positive background charge confining potential is usually used to model a realistic confinement.@xcite parabolic confining potential is commonly used in the research of qh dots.@xcite by numerically solving the poisson and schrodinger equations for electron states in a @xmath5 heterostructure with three spatial dimensions confinement in hartree approximation , kumar _",

    "our most robust results are summarized as what follows .",
    "ignoring zeeman coupling , the low energy spectra of @xmath0 ferromagnetic state can be mapped onto those of @xmath6 bosons on top of the ferromagnetic state .",
    "these excited bosons are edge spin waves ( esws ) , which propagate in _ both _ directions . under positive background charge confining potential ,",
    "the ferromagnetic state is stable as the distance @xmath7 from positive background charge layer to 2deg approaches zero .",
    "when the distance @xmath7 becomes larger , ferromagnetic state is destabilized by softening of esws , resulting in edge spin textures . under parabolic or linear confinement ,",
    "the ferromagnetic state is destabilized by softening of esws under both smoother and stronger confinements , and the ferromagnetic state window disappears as the particle number @xmath8 increases .",
    "in @xmath1 regime , compact states ( defined below ) with different total spin @xmath9 can always become ground states in some regions of parameter space .",
    "the low energy excitations of a compact state can be mapped onto those of @xmath6 bosons on top of it , thus are esws of this compact state .",

    "for this reason , we believe that the limited orbital number @xmath65 we have chosen has little effect to restrict the electrons to the inner orbitals , and the results will not change qualitatively if larger @xmath65 is used in this exact diagonalization calculation .    at this point",
    ", we also need to introduce a standard to identify the filling factor @xmath74 of the electron systems for the future calculation . for finite systems",
    "it is very easy to identify the @xmath0 and @xmath25 states , because electrons just completely occupy the innermost lowest ll orbitals of the single or two spin component(s ) and form a slater determinant state .",
    "the finite size systems for @xmath2 state study should have even numbers of particle . as the confinement smoothes , electron system transits from unpolarized @xmath2 state to partially polarized states , and finally to polarized @xmath0 state . when the system is in this transition region , we say it is in @xmath75 regime . for an electron system with filling factor @xmath0 , when the confinement becomes smoother ( stronger ) , electrons would tend to distribute in more ( less ) orbitals .",

    "quantum mechanically the electron s wave function has width @xmath89 in the radial direction .",
    "for this reason , in the electrostatic model , we put the test electron at a point which is @xmath90 away from the electron layer s border and @xmath91 . besides direct interaction ,",
    "exchange interaction between two electrons with same spin in the 2deg , is also an essential factor of edge instability . to include exchange interaction in our electrostatic model , we consider the following .",
    "first , exchange interaction is attractive , which can be modeled as the direct interaction between some hypothetical _ positive _ charges in the disk and the edge test electron .",
    "second , exchange interaction has a short range with the order of magnetic length @xmath49 in the qh regime .",
    "therefore , including the effect of exchange interaction at @xmath0 ( where exchange effects exists between all pairs of electrons ) , we reduce the radius of the ( negatively charged ) disk from @xmath92 to @xmath93 without changing the charge density @xmath30 , where @xmath94 also has the order of @xmath49 . a similar model ( with proper modification ) can be used to describe the @xmath2 case .    as shown in fig .",
