    "this is not the only importance of non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity .",
    "in fact non - minimal coupling provides a mechanism for generating spontaneous symmetry breaking at planck scale on the brane[53 ] . in this respect and based on the arguments presented at the introduction on the importance of the non - minimal coupling , non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity on the brane itself is a high energy correction of the theory and it is natural to expect that this effect couples with stringy effects in planck scale .",
    "in fact in this setup , we encounter a smoother behavior due to gauss - bonnet term ( a finite density big bang ) and the late - time effects of non - minimally coupled scalar field component .",
    "these effects together provide a more reliable cosmological scenario .",
    "the behavior of @xmath49 with respect to @xmath101 is shown in figure @xmath102 .",
    "this figure shows also that the gbig1 and gbig2 branches have self - acceleration for some positive values of non - minimal coupling in the same manner as the dgp(+ ) branch , whereas gbig3 branch similar to dgp(- ) has no self - acceleration .",

    "for large values of @xmath16 , the universe age and its initial density are higher than the case with a small value of @xmath16 . moreover , by increasing @xmath16 , one of the solutions , that is , gbig4 disappears from the set of the solutions ( note that these results are obtained for constant values of @xmath173 and @xmath183 while @xmath16 is variable ) .",

    "however , current observational data show that the equation of state parameter @xmath184 was larger than @xmath187 in the past and is less than @xmath187 today [ 66,67 ] . in our framework",
    ", we have seen that in a suitable domain of parameters space , by increasing @xmath16 values the gbig4 branch containing a bouncing cosmology will disappear . even for a constant @xmath16",
    "there is no bouncing solution for any values of @xmath173 .",
    "for example with @xmath172 , this branch disappear completely .",
    "these arguments show that inclusion of non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity on the brane can be used to fine - tune braneworld cosmological models in the favor of observational data .",
    "in this section we discuss more general case of a time - dependent non - minimal coupling .",
    "all arguments presented in the preceding sections can be reconsidered in this time - dependent framework .",
    "we focus on minkowski bulk ( @xmath93 ) with brane tension(@xmath132 ) for instance . starting with friedmann equation ( 35 )",
    ", we try the following ansatz @xmath188 in order to investigate the late - time behavior of this scenario . as has been mentioned at the end of the subsection @xmath189 , the values of @xmath161 are constraint to be in the range of @xmath190 and @xmath191 . by adapting these conditions and choosing @xmath192 , equation ( 35 )",
    "can be rewritten as follows @xmath193^{2}.\\ ] ] where proportionality constant in ( 46 ) has been set equal to unity .",
    "the constraints on @xmath161 are now time - dependent as @xmath194 and @xmath195",
    ". the results of numerical solution of this equation are shown in figures @xmath196 and @xmath197 for different values of @xmath161 .",
    "note that three graphs of figure @xmath196 ( and also figure @xmath197 with a different value of non - minimal coupling coefficient @xmath161 ) are corresponding to three branches of figure @xmath145 , but now with time variation of non - minimal coupling .",
    "these solutions are various possibilities of gbig scenario with a time varying non - minimally coupled scalar field on the brane . for instance , figures @xmath198 and @xmath199 are corresponding to gbig2 branch of the scenario . on the other hand , figures",
    "@xmath200 and @xmath201 are corresponding to gbig1 branch and finally , @xmath202 and @xmath203 are corresponding to gbig3 branch .",
    "the main point to stress here is the fact that in the presence of explicit time evolution of scalar field , these branches show more or less the same late - time behavior as discussed in previous sections .    finally the issue of stability of the self - accelerated solutions should be stressed here .",
    "it has been shown that the self - accelerating branch of the dgp model contains a ghost at the linearized level [ 68 ] .",
    "the ghost carries negative energy density and it leads to the instability of the spacetime .",
    "the presence of the ghost can be related to the infinite volume of the extra - dimension in dgp setup . when there are ghosts instabilities in self - accelerating branch , it is natural to ask what are the results of solutions decay .",
    "one possible answer to this question is as follows : since the normal branch solutions are ghost - free , one can think that the self - accelerating solutions may decay into the normal branch solutions .",
    "in fact for a given brane tension , the hubble parameter in the self - accelerating universe is larger than that of the normal branch solutions",
    ". then it is possible to have nucleation of bubbles of the normal branch in the environment of the self - accelerating branch solution .",
    "this is similar to the false vacuum decay in de sitter space .",
    "however , there are arguments against this kind of reasoning which suggest that the self - accelerating branch does not decay into the normal branch by forming normal branch bubbles [ 68 ] .",
    "it was also shown that the introduction of gauss - bonnet term in the bulk does not help to overcome this problem [ 69 ] .",
    "in fact , it is still unclear what is the end state of the ghost instability in self - accelerated branch of dgp inspired setups ( for more details see [ 68 ] ) . on the other hand , non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity provides a new degree of freedom which requires special fine tuning and this my provide a suitable basis to treat ghost instability .",
    "as we have shown , non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity has the capability to remove bouncing solutions .",
    "it seems that this additional degree of freedom has also the capability to provide the background for a more reliable solution to ghost instability .",
    "this issue deserves as a new research program .",
    "dgp model modifies the ir sector of general relativity . in the uv limit of a reliable theory",
    ", stringy effects should play important role . in this viewpoint , to discuss both uv and ir limit of the scenario simultaneously , the dgp model is not sufficient alone and we should incorporate stringy effects via inclusion of the gauss - bonnet terms .",
    "the presence of gb term removes the big bang singularity , and the universe starts with an initial finite density .",
    "non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity on the brane which is motivated from several compelling reasons , controls the value of the initial density in a finite big bang cosmology on the brane .",
    "this is not the only importance of non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity ; non - minimal coupling provides a mechanism for generating spontaneous symmetry breaking at planck scale on the brane . in this respect ,",
    "non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity on the brane itself is a high energy correction of the theory and it is natural to expect that this effect couples with stringy effects in planck scale .",
    "investigation of the late - time behavior of dgp scenario with gb and non - minimal coupling effects provides a framework for constraining non - minimal coupling using recent observational data . in our model ,",
    "the values of non - minimal coupling are constraint so that the values that @xmath161 can attain are constraint to be in the range of @xmath204 and @xmath166 . in our setup , these constraints are dependent on the scalar field dynamics and this is reasonable since essentially dynamics of scalar field affects its coupling to gravity .",
    "one of the main outcome of our analysis is the implication of non - minimal coupling on bouncing cosmologies . in the bouncing universe , the equation of state parameter of the matter content , @xmath184 ,",
    "must transit from @xmath185 to @xmath186 .",
    "however , current observational data show that the equation of state parameter @xmath184 was larger than @xmath187 in the past and is less than @xmath187 today . in our framework",
    ", we have seen that with a suitable parameter space , by increasing @xmath16 values , the gbig4 branch containing a bouncing cosmology will disappear . even for a constant @xmath16",
    "there is no bouncing solution for any values of @xmath173 .",
    "these arguments show that inclusion of non - minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity on the brane can be used to fine - tune braneworld cosmological models in the favor of observational data .",
    "although most of the arguments in the paper are based on a time independent non - minimal coupling , but as we have shown , inclusion of an explicit time dependence of non - minimal coupling will not change the physical nature of the solutions .",
    "finally we have discussed the issue of ghost instabilities in self - accelerated solutions and possible impacts of gauss - bonnet term and non - minimal coupling on this issue .",
