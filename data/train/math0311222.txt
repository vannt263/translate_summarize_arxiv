    "@xmath1 comprises a group @xmath9 and a subgroup @xmath8 for which every double coset is a finite union of left cosets , and the associated _ hecke algebra _ , generated by the characteristic functions of double cosets , reduces to the group @xmath10-algebra of @xmath11 when @xmath8 is normal .",
    "there is an extensive literature on hecke algebras and hecke subgroups , most commonly treating pairs of semi - simple groups such as @xmath12 .",
    "bost and connes @xcite introduced hecke algebras to operator algebraists with ( among other things ) the realization that solvable groups give interesting number - theoretic examples of spontaneous symmetry - breaking .",
    "a number of authors , partly in an attempt to understand @xcite ( see remark   for references ) have studied hecke @xmath5-algebras as crossed products by semigroup actions . here",
    "we give a different construction , using what we call the _ schlichting completion _",
    "@xmath2 , based in part upon recent work of tzanev @xcite .",
    "( a slight variation on this construction appears in @xcite . )",
    "the idea is that @xmath3 is a compact open subgroup of @xmath4 such that the hecke algebra of @xmath2 is naturally identified with the hecke algebra @xmath0 of @xmath1 .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath13 of @xmath3 is a projection in the group @xmath5-algebra @xmath14 , and @xmath0 can be identified with @xmath15 ; thus closure of @xmath0 in @xmath16 coincides with the corner @xmath17 , which is morita - rieffel equivalent to the ideal @xmath18 .",
    "( this is morita - rieffel equivalence in its most basic form : one of the motivating examples in @xcite was that godement s study of a group @xmath4 with a `` large '' compact subgroup @xmath3 can be explained by the fact that @xmath17 and @xmath18 have the same representation theory . in this more general situation",
    "@xmath3 need not be open , so @xmath19 . )",
    "we also require a variant of rieffel s theory due to fell , allowing us to relate representations of @xmath0 to certain representations of @xmath9 using a bimodule which is not quite a `` pre - imprimitivity bimodule '' in rieffel s sense .",
    "we shall describe situations in which the ideal @xmath18 can be identified using crossed products .",
    "our thesis is that schlichting completions can be used to efficiently study the representation theory of hecke algebras , and we focus on the following phenomena : ( 1 ) sometimes @xmath17 is the enveloping @xmath5-algebra @xmath20 of the hecke algebra @xmath0 , and ( 2 ) sometimes the projection @xmath13 is full in @xmath16 , making the @xmath5-completion @xmath17 of @xmath0 morita - rieffel equivalent to the group @xmath5-algebra @xmath16 .",
    "earlier approaches to these issues ( see for example @xcite ) depend upon the fact that the semigroup @xmath21 in their cases satisfies @xmath22 ; this is equivalent to the family @xmath23 of conjugates of @xmath8 being downward directed , and we investigate this directedness condition in more detail .",
    "we also show that in order to have @xmath24 it is sufficient that @xmath9 have a normal subgroup which contains @xmath8 as a normal subgroup .",
    "there are other aspects of hecke algebras , not treated here , which we believe will be best studied using our approach , such as the treatment of kms states in @xcite , homology and @xmath25-theory in  @xcite , and the @xmath26-prime analogue of the bost - connes algebra studied in @xcite .",
    "also the generalized hecke algebras in @xcite can be studied in a similar fashion .",

    "we also give three alternative descriptions of the schlichting completion : as an inverse limit , as the weak ( = strong ) closure of @xmath9 in the quasi - regular representation on @xmath27 , and as the spectrum of a certain commutative hopf @xmath5-algebra .    in section",
    "we give the main technical properties of the projection @xmath28 . in section",
    "we use the imprimitivity theorems of fell and rieffel to relate _ positive _ representations of the hecke algebra @xmath0 and _ smooth _ representations of @xmath9 .",
    "the semigroup @xmath29 is studied in section   and is used in theorems  [ directed c * ] and [ directed full ] to show that if @xmath22 then both phenomena  ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) occur , recovering results of @xcite .",
    "section   concerns a special situation involving a semidirect product , which appears in many examples in the hecke-@xmath5-algebra literature .",
    "in particular , we give a direct proof that the hecke @xmath5-algebra is isomorphic to a full corner in a transformation group @xmath5-algebra without using the theory of semigroup actions ( as for example is done in @xcite ) ; we also show that the existence of a directing semigroup @xmath29 is not needed in general .",
    "in addition we give an alternate analysis in terms of a certain transformation groupoid studied in @xcite .",
    "the full justification of the main result of section   is deferred until section  , where it is given in a more general context involving the twisted crossed products of green @xcite .",
    "the semigroup @xmath29 is closely related to ( and in some cases the same as ) the one which appears in the semigroup crossed products of some authors mentioned above , although for us the semigroup crossed products play no role . in section",
    "we show how our techniques can be used to easily recover the dilation result of @xcite .",
    "finally , in section   we illustrate our results with a number of examples .",
    "it turns out that even finite groups pose unanswered questions . while the rational `` ax+b''-group treated in @xcite exhibits both phenomena  ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) above  namely @xmath24 and @xmath13 is full in @xmath16",

    "so @xmath76 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath57 is in general _ not _ complete with respect to either one - sided uniformity ; see example   for an illustration of this .",
    "recall that @xmath56 , being a product , may be viewed as an inverse limit : let @xmath77 denote the family of finite subsets of @xmath55 , and for each @xmath78 let @xmath79 denote the set of maps from @xmath80 to @xmath55 , with the product topology . for @xmath81 , define @xmath82 by restriction : that is , @xmath83 .",
