    "after the recent discovery of the reactor angle @xmath8 and its measurement in the daya bay @xcite and reno @xcite reactor experiments , experimental efforts in the neutrino sector are now devoted to establishing the presence of charged parity ( cp ) violation in the lepton sector , the neutrino mass ordering and the absolute neutrino mass scale .",

    ", with a best fit point around @xmath14 .",
    "this shows the large increase of sensitivity in the determination of @xmath10 when performing a combined analysis of reactor and super - beam data @xcite .",
    "+ the strength of such a procedure can also be used to test the presence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) in the neutrino sector ( affecting neutrino oscillation probabilities ) and , to some extent , to analyze its impact on the determination of the standard oscillation parameters . in this paper , we consider two possible such scenarios : the so called non - standard neutrino interactions ( nsi ) , where the neutrino interactions with ordinary matter are parametrized at low energy in terms of effective flavour - dependent couplings @xmath15 @xcite , and the large extra dimensions ( led ) model , where sterile neutrinos can propagate in a larger than three dimensional space whereas the sm left - handed neutrinos are confined to a four dimensional ( 4-d ) space - time brane @xcite .",
    "the effects of sterile neutrinos have been also recently studied in the context of short - baseline oscillation experiments and in the beta spectrum as measurable by katrin - like experiments ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to take full advantage of whole t2k ( @xmath16 appearance @xcite and @xmath17 disappearance @xcite ) and @xmath18 daya bay @xcite data in order to :    * study in details how the correlation between the standard oscillation parameters are modified by the presence of new physics @xcite ; * constrain the parameter space of the led and nsi models .    in",
    "what follows , we will first recall the main features of the nsi and led models . then , after a brief description of the statistical technique employed in analyzing the experimental data , we will discuss how the presence of new physics modifies the correlation among the standard oscillation parameters .",
    "finally , we will give the constraints on the model parameters obtained from the joint analysis of the daya bay and t2k data .",
    "the nsi approach describes a large class of new physics models where the neutrino interactions with ordinary matter are parametrized at low energy in terms of effective flavour - dependent couplings @xmath15 , of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electroweak scale and @xmath21 is the scale where new physics sets in .",
