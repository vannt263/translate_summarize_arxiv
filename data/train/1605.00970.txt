    "since teleportation was first introduced as a concept in 1993 @xcite it has also been implemented in trapped ions  ( @xcite -@xcite ) , cold atomic ensembles  ( @xcite -@xcite ) , solid state and nmr systems  ( @xcite - @xcite ) , as well as in optical - modes  ( @xcite -@xcite ) , photonic polarisation  ( @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) and spin - orbital angular momenta states  ( @xcite ) .",

    "particle 3 is generated by an epr source jointly with particle 2 in a maximally entangled singlet state described by @xmath2 , which establishes a quantum communication channel .",
    "the result of the bell - state analysis  @xcite performed by alice is communicated to bob via a classical channel , who then recovers the state on particle 3 , thus completing the teleportation .",
    "the initial state on particle 1 is destroyed ( maximally mixed).,width=566 ]    a fundamental distinction between teleportation and classical communication stems from the _ no - cloning theorem _",
    "@xcite in quantum mechanics , which states that no _ copy _ of a quantum state can be made . note that this does not mean a quantum state can not be _ transferred _ from one particle to another , but merely that a reproduction of it can not coexist with the original . in practise",
    "this means that during a teleportation , the initial quantum state is destroyed , by becoming maximally mixed , so that at the end we are not left with any copies of the state with which we started .",
    "rather , only the teleported state remains , and this will have been transferred across to the recipient particle where it will now reside , as illustrated in figure  [ generictelprotocol ] . unlike classical communication ,",
    "teleportation is not a facsimile process .",

    "a laboratory implementation of the scheme would require single - photon detection devices to be located along all the side - outputs of the two branches , as shown in figure  [ epr(nn ) ] .",
    "apart from the qubit , we consider only even number inputs of photons , although the scheme can be extended to assymmetric inputs too .",
    "each outcome , or state , in equation ( [ eq sub - outcomes ] ) will have associated with it a probability amplitude as a function of the transmittivities of the beam - splitter in the two branches :    d|1_1|2n-1_2+e|0_1|2n_2 [ eq sumsuboutcomes ] where @xmath9 represent expressions for the amplitudes in terms of variables @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",

    "it follows that we require also @xmath60 independent transmittivities if we are to solve @xmath60 equations .",
    "this requirement is ensured by introducing @xmath25 beam - splitters for an input of @xmath96 photons .",

    "+   + figure  [ epr(nn ) ] shows the proposed set - up for a generic epr source for a symmetric input of number state in its two branches , labelled @xmath1 and @xmath3 .    a note on the scope of our argument : generally , the epr scheme produces bell - type states for symmetric inputs of photons ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "maximally entangled states thus produced will have the form expressed in equation  [ eq generalbell ] : @xmath99 @xmath100 \\label{eq generalbell}\\ ] ]    where n is the number of photons injected into each branch @xmath101 and @xmath102 in figure  [ epr(nn ) ] .",
    "+ such maximally entangled states can be used in teleportation of any pure state with an _ odd number _ of terms in the superposition : that is , qutrits ( @xmath103 , qupentits ( @xmath104 , quheptits ( @xmath105 ) and so on .",
    "generating bell - type states required to teleport _ even number _ arbitrary - dimensional pure states , such as quadrits ( @xmath106)and quhexits ( @xmath107 ) , requires an asymmetric input in the input channels @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",

    "it has been suggested in @xcite that linear optical elements would prove unamenable to the task of producing maximally entangled states .",
    "our findings suggest that their full potential remains as yet unused and have much to contribute before resorting to non - linear methods and the challenges associated with those . +   + the main limitation on the higher orders remains the efficiency , which we see fall exponentially for each step increase of the number of photons and optical elements in the system .",
    "there is an additional drop in efficiency due to the fact that only one of the bell - states in any given basis can be identified , going as @xmath108 for a d - dimensional teleportee state .",

    "for any given bell state produced by our epr source , the outputs of the bsa would give back exactly the number of photons used as inputs for the epr source.,width=566 ]    an advantage of the proposed the epr source is that it can be adapted for use as a bell state analyser .",
    "this follows from the fact that the scheme consists of a series of unitary operations carried out by linear optical elements .",
    "if a bell - state produced by our scheme is then driven back through the system in time - reversal fashion , that is , it undergoes in _ reverse sequence _ the same operations that produced it ( starting with the last operation ) , we can regain our input states .",
    "thus by inverting our epr scheme , as shown in figure  [ bsa(nn ) ] , where the input is now a bell - state , the outputs are symmetrical numbers of photons from which we can infer which bell - state is present .",
    "the bsa time - reversal measurement consists of applying the conjugate unitary transformation for every optical element .",
    "this means that what were previously the output states in the epr scheme are now the inputs for the bsa .",
    "broadly , the scheme for generating the maximally entangled states is reversed in the sense of undoing all the unitary transformations in order to know what were its number - state inputs .",
    "this is equivalent to knowing what bell - state was present at the bsa input .",
    "figures  [ uu(11 ) ] and  [ uu ] show how the two schemes for producing maximally entangled states and then measuring them come together in a complete teleportation set - up .",
    ", then to perform a bell - measurement , the bsa need only apply the conjugate transformations in a time - reverse , @xmath109 , fashion .",
    "this makes the scheme symmetrical.,width=566 ]    in the example on figure  [ uu(11 ) ] , the epr source generates by a series of unitary transformations @xmath110 , the maximally entangled state required for the teleportation of a qutrit .",
    "this is followed by a bell - state analysis performed by the bsa , which reverses the epr source s operations by applying the conjugate transformation @xmath109 . here ,",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 represent all the individual operations performed by each optical element in the scheme that produces and measures the bell state",
    ". this set - up has the property of being symmetrical , which lends it more readily to implementation .",
    "here , the epr source takes an input of @xmath63 to generate one of the bell - type states required for a qutrit , while the bsa in this example `` measures '' an output @xmath93 with detectors @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "this tells us that the bell state into which the qutrit was projected , must be the one produced by an input of @xmath93 at the epr source . +",
    "a limitation of the scheme is that in its simplest form , the bsa can identify only one of the possible nine bell states available to a qutrit .",
    "this entails a drop in the teleportation efficiency to one - ninth of an ideal bsa .",
    "however , using a polarising beam - splitter ( pbs ) can help to improve efficiency , although this would still not remove the exponential decay in efficiency for higher dimensional states .",
    "+   + our teleportation scheme can be generalised to an arbitrary - dimensional pure state , or @xmath114 ( figure  [ uu](b ) ) since our epr source can ensure a supply of maximally entangled states of the correct form , while the bsa applies the reverse operation .",
    "however , the teleportation efficiency is highly sensitive to the dimension of the qudit , showing an exponential drop the larger the qudit .",
    "this is a consequence of the exponential fall in the efficiency of producing and detecting the bell - states for large qudit dimensions .",
    "the efficiency of the bsa falls also exponentially , since the measurement process is merely the reverse of the production sequence .",
    "however , this problem can be avoided by keeping to relatively low - dimensional qudits , and in particular , input states up to say @xmath94 are well within experimental reach .    .",
    "the epr source ensures that the bell - state required for the qudit is produced , while the bsa applies the reverse operation to measure the bell state . as the dimension of the qudit increases",
    ", the efficiency of teleportation falls exponentially . ]",
    "another practical difficulty in the implementation of the teleportation scheme is the challenge of single - photon detection .",
    "one way of detecting single - photons using avalanche photodiodes or photomultipliers , would be to introduce further cascades of symmetric beam - splitters at the outputs .",
    "a `` click '' in a detector does not tell us whether one , two or maybe three photons were incident simultaneously . by introducing a symmetric beam - splitter into a beam consisting of",
    "say two photons , we double the probability that the `` click '' is caused by a single photon . introducing yet another beam - splitter would further increase the detection reliability , albeit at the expense of the overall efficiency of the scheme .",
    "however , this has become much less of a problem in recent years with the advent of highly efficient , low - noise , single - photon detectors .",
    "we began by introducing potential applications of number - state teleportation as an effective method of information transfer in the context of quantum information processing .",
    "we took as our starting point a qubit teleportation protocol that we extended to an arbitrary dimensional number states , using linear optical elements exclusively . to this end",
    ", we presented a procedure for generating maximally entangled states on demand and of the required dimension , by using a cascade of beam - splitters arranged cross - beam fashion along two axes in a symmetrical `` v '' layout .",
    "the key aspect of our epr scheme relied on treating the sequence of beam - splitter transmittivities along each axis as variables .",
    "their values were determined by the solutions to a set simultaneous equations representing the amplitudes for the sub - selection of number states forming the desired bell - type state .",
    "it was then shown how the scheme for the epr source could easily be adapted for use as a bell - state analyser when implemented in a time - reversal manner .",
    "finally , it was demonstrated that when the output of the epr scheme is used as the input to the bsa , we have a complete teleportation set - up for arbitrary dimensional number - states .",
    "+   + consideration was also given to the challenges associated with implementing this scheme .",
    "teleportation efficiency decays exponentially for stepwise increases in the number - state dimension .",
    "this difficulty can be avoided by using lower - dimensional states . in terms of applications , it is unlikely that high - dimensional state teleportation would find wide use , partly because of the technical difficulty of preparing large pure states ( i.e. the states to be teleported ) . however , towards the lower - dimensional end , say , for qutrits , the teleportation method proposed here maintains a high efficiency ( see section  [ tab transmitvals ] for summary of values ) .",
