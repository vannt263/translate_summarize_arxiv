    "can be derived .",
    "this is done by considering resonance pairs and arguing that they correctly account for the flow of the coupling distribution to the leading logarithmic order ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the rg flow preserves the form of the hopping amplitudes @xmath25 in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and modifies the distribution @xmath21 .",

    "the flow of the distribution @xmath46 obtained by solving ( [ ( 3.13 ) ] ) has a number of properties similar to that of boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "the reason is that in considering only pair resonances and ignoring correlations between resonances at different scales one makes an approximation of the same nature as the pair collision approximation in boltzmann theory of weakly nonideal gases .",
    "two properties of the flow ( [ ( 3.13 ) ] ) are of interest .",

    "these results can be used to fully characterize the fix points of the flow ( [ ( 3.13 ) ] ) . by maximizing the entropy ( [ entropy ] ) for given moments @xmath51 one obtains the family @xmath52 the normalization constant @xmath53 depends on the matrix @xmath54 .",
    "it is interesting that the distributions ( [ fix - point ] ) are normalizable only when the number of components @xmath23 is greater than one ( and matrix @xmath51 is nondegenerate ) . because of that , the flow ( [ ( 3.13 ) ] ) has very different properties for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    in the @xmath56 case , for any initial conditions @xmath57 , the distribution @xmath58 evolves to one of stationary distributions ( [ fix - point ] ) . on the other hand , for @xmath55 possible fix point distributions allowed by h - theorem are non - normalizable .",
    "therefore , since @xmath59 , the flow ( [ ( 3.13 ) ] ) does not have a fix point .",
    "these two qualitatively different types of flow are displayed in figures  [ fig1],[fig2 ] .",
    "the simulation was performed by using @xmath60 states characterized by random energies and coupling vectors .",
    "the energy distribution was uniform with @xmath61 and did not evolve .",
    "the distribution of @xmath62 evolved to a fix point of the form ( [ fix - point ] ) for @xmath63 and diverged for @xmath55 .",
    "the rg hierarchy of states constructed as resonances on different scales implies fractal structure the wavefunctions . to understand scaling of eigenstates , one can extend rg by including in it the distribution of wavefunction amplitudes .",
    "below we consider the distribution of participation ratios of the states . for a normalized state",
    "@xmath64 its participation ratio @xmath65 is defined as @xmath66 in the localization problem the participation ratios are used as a measure of the degree of localization . the scaling exponent @xmath67 of participation ratios defined as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the system size , characterizes possible universality classes . in the localized regime @xmath70 , in the delocalized regime @xmath71 , and at the critical point @xmath72 .",
    "it is straightforward to put the distribution of participation ratios in the rg scheme . for that one has to consider the flow of the distribution @xmath73 . following the discussion of sec .",

    "it is of interest to consider the flow ( [ ( 7.4 ) ] ) in the scaling limit , when the distribution of @xmath62 given by @xmath84 evolves to the fix points discussed in sec .",
    "we studied numerically evolution of the participation ratios distribution @xmath85 .    because of the expected power law scaling @xmath86 it is natural to consider the distribution of @xmath87 .",
    "the results of the simulation for @xmath63 and @xmath55 are shown in figures  [ fig3],[fig4 ] .",
    "parameters used are the same as in figures  [ fig1],[fig2 ] .",
    "the results for @xmath63 and @xmath55 are quite different . for @xmath63 ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath87 forms a peak of slowly varying width .",
    "the center of the distribution moves linearly with the rg time @xmath88 , which corresponds to a single scaling exponent @xmath67 given by the peak velocity .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath55 , the left edge of the distribution is fixed at @xmath89 .",
    "after rescaling , the distributions at different @xmath88 collapse on one another .",
    "this means that participation ratios are characterized by a",
    "_ continuous spectrum _ of scaling exponents @xmath67 , rather than by a single exponent .",
    "the values of @xmath67 are not universal because of a many - parameter family of fix points parameterized by @xmath51 as discussed in sec .",
    "[ rg ] . even for spherically symmetric distributions with @xmath90 ,",
    "the distribution depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath91 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath92 however is quite simple .",
    "numerically , we find that doubling @xmath93 doubles velocity of the center of the distribution of @xmath87 , without changing of its overall form .",
    "this implies that scaling exponents @xmath67 can be written as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and has a universal distribution .",
    "this estimate is in agreement with the result for the mean participation ratio @xcite , where it was found that @xmath96 scales as @xmath97 with @xmath95 .",
    "in some cases , the rg approach outlined above can be extended to many - body problems @xcite . here",
    "we consider a hamiltonian for interacting two - level systems in @xmath9 : @xmath98 here @xmath99 are pseudospin pauli matrices ( @xmath100 ) , and @xmath101 are distances between two - level systems randomly distributed in space with concentration @xmath23 . both @xmath102 and @xmath103 are random uncorrelated numbers .",
    "the problem ( [ tls ] ) describes several physical situations , such as the dynamics of excitations in two - level systems in glasses interacting via elastic strain @xcite , or dipole excitations in the efros - shklovskii model of a disordered mott insulator @xcite . in the latter problem ,",
    "the conventional approach is to consider only @xmath104 couplings in ( [ tls ] ) . in this case",
    "excitations are strictly localized , and the only effect of interaction is the appearance of a logarithmic gap in the density of states at low energies .    here",
    "we focus on the opposite limit , and consider the effect of @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 couplings , ignoring other couplings .",
    "we assume that the interaction is weak , @xmath108 , and develop an rg scheme using this weak coupling .",
    "the @xmath109 approximation is frequently used for studying spin waves in spin systems . although it does not seem to be controlled by any small parameter",
    ", one should mention that the terms removed have zero matrix elements between different states with close energy .",
    "therefore , these terms can not produce resonances ( which are responsible for delocalization ) , so they are unlikely to be important as long as delocalization of states is concerned .",
    "fermionic model is obtained by replacing pauli matrices in ( [ tls ] ) by fermi operators : @xmath110 .",
    "our main reason to employ this spin  pseudofermion transformation is that it gives an exact result for a pair of interacting spins , whereas only interacting pairs contribute to the leading logarithmic order in the rg .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "distributions of real @xmath114 and complex @xmath115 , @xmath116 are assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "we denote them by @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively : @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h - fermi ] ) is bilinear in @xmath121 , @xmath122 and can be treated perturbatively by an rg in the weak coupling regime @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "the rg scheme is based on resonance pairs of pseudofermions : @xmath125 the hamiltonian ( [ f - pair ] ) can be diagonalized by a two step bogoliubov transformation : ( 1 ) @xmath126 ; ( 2 ) @xmath127 , where @xmath128 @xmath129 the resulting diagonal hamiltonian is @xmath130 , where @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) the interaction with @xmath80 and @xmath81 is given by @xmath133 in accordance with the picture of resonance pairs we can consider only the case @xmath134 ,   @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , @xmath136 is almost equal to @xmath137 and hence the two bogoliubov transformations act on @xmath138 and @xmath139 as @xmath140 where @xmath141 stands for complex conjugate .",
    "similarly to how it was done in sec.s  [ rg],[scaling ] , these expressions can be used to derive an rg flow for distributions : @xmath142 here we introduced a condensed notation @xmath143 , so @xmath144 is a distribution of @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , the @xmath148function @xmath149 , _ etc . _ the brackets @xmath150 stand for averaging @xmath151 .",
    "( here the integration volume elements are 2- and 5-dimensional because @xmath152 and @xmath153 are complex . )",
    "the expression @xmath150 in ( [ f - rg ] ) is of order of @xmath154 , so the rhs of ( [ f - rg ] ) has no explicit dependence on @xmath88 .",
    "the rg flow ( [ f - rg ] ) restricted to the distribution of couplings @xmath155 , @xmath156 is analogous to that discuss in sec .",
    "one can prove an h - theorem , verify that second moments are conserved , and derive stationary fix - point distributions : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is real and @xmath159 is complex , satisfying @xmath160 for normalizability of @xmath161 .    a new aspect of the pseudofermion problem is a nontrivial rg flow of the density of states . to study how the distribution of energies @xmath162 evolves",
    ", we consider a particular class of distributions : @xmath163 with @xmath164 being the fix - point distribution of the form ( [ f - fix ] ) .",
    "( such an ansatz is consistent with eq.([f - rg ] ) . )",
    "substituting this into ( [ f - rg ] ) one obtains @xmath165 we studied the flow of @xmath117 numerically ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "there are two distinct features in the flow of @xmath117 .",
    "initially , at small @xmath88 , the density of states decreases at all @xmath147 due to energy repulsion . at large @xmath88 , it increases in the vicinity of @xmath166 forming a singularity .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig5 ] that the first effect is transitional and quickly saturates , whereas the second one is characteristic for the scaling limit .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result with the efros - shklovskii theory of coulomb gap which predicts a logarithmic suppression of the density of states near @xmath166 for the problem ( [ tls ] ) with @xmath167 couplings . in the above analysis we ignored these couplings because they do not lead to delocalization of excitations .",
    "the effect of @xmath167 couplings on the density of states is of the same order as the effects we consider .",
    "however , it has an opposite sign .    therefore , there are two different phases possible in the problem ( [ tls ] ) depending on relative strength of different couplings .",
    "if the @xmath167 coupling dominates , the system will have a soft gap in the density of states . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 couplings dominate , there will be a peak in the density of states at @xmath166 .",
    "our analysis indicates that the peak is described by a power law singularity with the exponent of order of @xmath93 .    in both phases , however ,",
    "excitations are delocalized .",
    "according to secs .",
    "[ rg],[scaling ] , the states in this problem are critical .",
    "delocalized states will give rise to thermal conductivity and , in the coulomb gap state , will make variable range hopping conductivity possible even in the absence of electron  phonon coupling .",
    "the rg approach predicts nontrivial fix points of hamiltonians with long range hopping .",
    "wavefunctions in such systems are critical , and the participation ratios are characterized by scaling exponents which depend on the nature of the fix point . in some cases , for a particular hamiltonian different states can have different exponents , and so the system is characterized by a distribution of exponents , rather than by a single exponent .",
    "( the possibility of the absence of self - averaging of the participation ratio exponent was considered recently @xcite . )",
    "the rg method can be applied to the problem of interacting two - level systems . in doing this",
    "it is important to extend the rg by including renormalization of the density of states .",
    "depending on the choice of couplings , two different phases are possible , both characterized by a singularity in the density of states at @xmath166 . in one phase",
    "the density of states diverges at @xmath166 , whereas in the other phase it vanishes .",
    "it is possible that the first behavior is relevant for the problem of low energy excitations in glasses , where an increase in the density of states at low energies due to interactions between two - level systems has been conjectured@xcite ."
