    "certain kinds of quirks have already been searched for at the tevatron by the d0 collaboration @xcite .    in this paper , we are mainly interested in quirks that acquire mass through electroweak symmetry breaking .",

    "@xcite , where quirks acquired `` vector - like '' masses independently of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we are motivated in part by the discovery that chiral quirks bound in quirky baryons can lead to a viable asymmetric dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "we do not , however , restrict ourselves to the specific theory or detailed parameter choices of @xcite .",
    "instead , we consider general @xmath0 , and calculate the meson decay rates for both chiral quirks as well as vector - like quirks , demonstrating the experimentally distinguishable signatures .    at this point",
    "we should emphasize that only some aspects of quirky physics can be calculated ( or simulated ) with standard collider tools .",
    "in general , quirks can be produced in a standard collider physics process ( for us , weak production ) , but then the @xmath12 of the quirks must be shed before the quirks settle down into a low - angular - momentum state .",
    "this `` spin - down '' process is in general non - perturbative , with the resulting radiation dependent on the relative strengths of infracolor and other couplings of the quirks .",
    "after spin - down and energy loss , the constituent quirks annihilate , causing quirky mesons to decay .",

    "@xcite to @xmath22 infracolors .",
    "we assume @xmath23 , and neglect the infracolor confinement contribution to the quirky meson masses .",
    "the lagrangian that gives mass to the quirks is simply @xmath24 despite the abuse of notation ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , we emphasize that our quirks are color _ singlets_. after electroweak symmetry breaking , the quirks acquire masses @xmath28 . writing the electroweak doublet as @xmath29 ,",
    "we can write the quirks in terms of four - component dirac spinors @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath30 have electric charge @xmath32 .",
    "the quirky mesons formed from these objects include @xmath33    there are two interesting regions of parameter space satisfying the requirement @xmath34 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the procedure above can explain a large number of enhancements for different quirkonium decay processes .",
    "however , there are instances where the procedure predicts leading enhancements in some processes when there should not have been any .",
    "the fictitious leading enhancements predicted by this procedures are : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 state are not singly enhanced in two - body systems consisting of one transverse gauge boson .",
    "this can be seen by tracking the spin along the quirky fermion line .",
    "first , the @xmath43 projector is proportional to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the clebsh - gordon coefficients corresponding to the @xmath43 state , which vanishes for @xmath46 . in the systems being considered , there is only one vertex that flips the spin - the fermion - fermion - gauge boson vertex .",
    "the rest are either scalar ( higgs boson ) or pseudoscalar ( goldstone boson ) couplings that do not involve a spin flip .",
    "also , one can see that the dirac spinor @xmath47 has an opposite spin compared to the dirac spinor @xmath48 in the relation @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath43 state can not decay into any states consisting of only one transverse gauge boson ( with the other outgoing particle being the higgs or goldstone boson ) and the @xmath43 decay width can not be singly enhanced .",
    "we have calculated the chiral quirkonium decay rates for quirks that acquire mass through interactions with the higgs boson . while in this paper we have not studied the production rates of quirks at the lhc , this is straightforward using standard collider physics tools , and has been done recently in the literature . for vector - like quirks with electroweak quantum numbers , the production cross section was calculated in fig .",
    "6 of ref .",
    "there it was shown that pair production of uncolored quirks produced through @xmath50/@xmath51 exchange has a cross section ranging from roughly @xmath52 to @xmath53  fb at @xmath54 tev lhc for the quirkonium mass range of @xmath55 to @xmath56  gev .",
    "we expect that the chiral quirk production cross sections are very similar in size .",
    "given the spectacular signals that result from quirkonia decay , the discovery of quirkonium resonances can occur quickly .",
    "this is likely to occur well before the detailed properties ( spin , @xmath15 , @xmath57 , etc . ) of the resonances can be determined .",
    "the particular decay channels not only can tell us about the constituent quirks quantum numbers , but perhaps even more interestingly , how the quirks acquire mass .",
    "quirkonia with chiral quirks have longitudinal and yukawa enhancements that are absent or highly suppressed in quirkonia with vector - like quirks . in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated the striking differences between the dominant chiral quirkonium decay channels as compared with vector - like quirkonium decay channels .",
    "this should enable the lhc to easily distinguish whether quirks are chiral or vector - like from the observation and branching ratios of the dominant decay channels .    for electrically - charged chiral quirkonia composed of quirks with the quantum numbers given in this paper ,",
    "the state @xmath43 decays into @xmath1 or @xmath58 overwhelmingly for quirkonium masses larger than about @xmath59  gev .",
    "contrast this with vector - like quirkonia , where the @xmath43 with the quantum numbers given earlier in the paper , does not even have two - body decays .",
    "chiral quirkonia in the @xmath60 state have @xmath61 is the dominant decay channel . for vector - like quirkonia ,",
    "the @xmath62 , summed over all flavors of sm fermions , dominates .",
    "we also demonstrated that the lyman - alpha transition is dominant in all of the charged quirkonia @xmath15-states , except for @xmath63 for chiral quirkonia when the `` doubly - enhanced '' @xmath1 decay becomes significant for quirkonium masses @xmath64 gev .",
    "the @xmath65 decay deserves more discussion .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the @xmath65 channel is dominant when their squirk and anti - squirk pair has low relative velocity , in other words , an @xmath13-state .",
    "for our case , the @xmath65 partial width vanishes due to our choice of quantum numbers : @xmath66 , where we found the @xmath65 partial width is proportional to @xmath67 , see appendix  [ subsec : wgamma ] .    for electrically - neutral chiral quirkonia ,",
    "the dominant decay channels of @xmath43 are @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "again , contrast this with vector - like quirkonia where @xmath68 or @xmath69 dominates . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the @xmath68 channel dominates for chiral quirkonia , versus @xmath70 for vector - like quirkonia . for all @xmath15-states , lyman - alpha emission dominates for vector - like quirkonia , whereas for chiral quirkonia there are several decay channels that can become significant when the quirkonium mass is large .",
    "in particular , @xmath71 can dominate for @xmath72 , @xmath2 for @xmath63 , and @xmath68 for @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , perhaps one of the most interesting decay channels that we found is the @xmath72 decay into two higgs bosons , which becomes the dominant decay channel for quirkonium masses @xmath74 gev .",
    "this could be striking signal at lhc , given that the di - higgs system would reconstruct to an invariant mass peak of the @xmath72 state .    finally , it is tempting to consider applications of our results to various existing hints at colliders .",
    "for instance , the prominence of the electrically - charged chiral quirkonium decay channel , @xmath75 is suggestive : chiral quirkonia with mass @xmath76 gev with some minor modification of the @xmath77 decay into jets could easily lead to the cdf excess in the @xmath78 signal @xcite .",
    "the cross section can be easily adjusted to match the excess , simply by enlarging the number of infracolors or flavors of quirks . given the incredible performance of the lhc over the past several months , we leave this pursuit to future work .",

    "<S> we calculate the two - body decay rates of `` quirkonium '' states formed from quirks that acquire mass solely through electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",

    "<S> the quirks are in a chiral representation of the electroweak group , while in the other case , a vector - like representation . </S>",
    "<S> the differences in the dominant decay channels between `` chiral quirkonia '' versus `` vector - like quirkonia '' are striking . </S>",
    "<S> several chiral quirkonia states can decay into the unique two - body resonance channels @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4/@xmath5 , and @xmath6 , which never dominate for vector - like quirkonia . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the channels @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , are shared among both chiral and vector - like quirkonia . </S>",
    "<S> resonances of dileptons or light quarks ( dijets ) can dominate for some vector - like quirkonia states throughout their mass range , while these modes never dominate for chiral quirkonia unless the decays into pairs of gauge or higgs bosons are kinematically forbidden . </S>"
