    "the study of stochastic models that describe the spreading of a nonconserved agent is currently a very active field of research in nonequilibrium statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "fundamental interest stems from the fact that these models exhibit continuous nonequilibrium phase transitions from a fluctuating active phase into one or several absorbing states .",
    "moreover , such models are motivated by a variety of possible applications  @xcite such as epidemic spreading  @xcite , catalytic reactions  @xcite , or flowing sand  @xcite .",
    "usually models for epidemic spreading are defined on a lattice whose sites can be either occupied ( active , infected ) or empty ( inactive , healthy ) .",
    "the dynamic rules involve two competing processes , namely , spreading of activity to neighboring sites ( infection ) and spontaneous decay ( recovery ) .",
    "depending on the relative frequency of infection and recovery the process either has a finite probability to survive in an infinite system or it will eventually die out . since the spreading agent is not allowed to be created spontaneously , once the empty lattice is reached , the process is trapped in a so - called _ absorbing state _ from which it can not escape .",
    "usually the transition between infinite spreading and recovery is a critical phenomenon characterized by large - scale fluctuations associated with certain universality classes .",
    "therefore , the classification of all possible types of phase transitions into absorbing states is presently one of the major goals of nonequilibrium statistical physics .    the most prominent universality class of phase transitions into an absorbing state",
    "is that of directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite , as described by reggeon field theory  @xcite . models in this class describe short - range spreading of a non - conserved agent in a medium without temporal memory effects .",
    "additionally , it is assumed that the rates for spreading and recovery are constant in space and time ( no quenched randomness ) .",
    "phase diagram of the epidemic process with finite immunization on a square lattice in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "@xmath0 denotes the primary infection probability and @xmath1 the reinfection probability .",
    "the inset shows the vicinity of the dp point.,width=415 ]    if the medium has a memory such that each site can be infected only once , the transition does no longer belong to the dp class , instead one obtains the so - called `` general epidemic process '' ( gep )  @xcite . in the language of epidemic",
    "processes this type of memory accounts for _ perfect _ immunization .",
    "in contrast to dp , where sites can be reinfected without restriction , a general epidemic process can only spread in those parts of the system which have not been infected before .",
    "nevertheless , in spatial dimensions @xmath15 , infinite spreading from a single infected site in a non - immune environment is still possible , provided that the susceptibility to primary infections is sufficiently large . in this case activity",
    "propagates as a front , leaving a cluster of immune sites behind .",
    "the transition between survival and extinction of the spreading agent is then described by a different type of critical behavior , belonging to the universality class of dynamical percolation ( dyp )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the resulting cluster of immune sites has the same ( or even identical ) structure as an isotropic percolation cluster .",
    "for this reason dyp can be used as a dynamical procedure to generate isotropic percolation clusters .    as an immediate generalization one may consider an epidemic process in which the strength of immunization can be varied  @xcite . for example",
    ", the initial susceptibility to infections @xmath0 may be locally set to a different value @xmath1 when the first infection is encountered . in the following",
    "we shall denote this process as epidemic process with finite immunization which we abbreviate for convenience as epfi .",
    "the phase diagram of the epfi in two spatial dimensions was studied in  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] , it comprises three different phases , including the gep ( @xmath16 ) and dp ( @xmath17 ) as special cases .    the horizontal phase transition line in  fig",
    ".  [ phasediag ] can be explained as follows .",
    "obviously , when starting from a fully occupied lattice , all sites become immediately immune so that the infection rate is everywhere equal to @xmath1 .",
    "trivially , the dynamics is then precisely that of a dp process controlled by @xmath1 .",
    "this gives rise to a dp transition at @xmath4 , independent of @xmath0 , where @xmath6 denotes the critical value of an ordinary dp process .",
    "however , starting with a localized infected seed in a non - immune environment , the situation is more subtle , though the horizontal line still exists .",
    "for example , slightly above the critical line , i.e. for @xmath18 with @xmath19 , the interior of a surviving cluster is essentially dominated by an ordinary supercritical dp process .",
    "since such a dp process is characterized on large scales by a finite density of active sites , there will be a finite chance for the process to survive in the limit @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the situation below the horizontal line ( @xmath21 ) is different . in at least two or more dimensions this part of the phase diagram displays _ two _ distinct phases ,",
    "namely , an absorbing phase , where the process stops after some time , and a phase of annular growth , where an expanding front of high activity survives with finite probability . performing a field - theoretic renormalization group study close to the upper critical dimension of dyp , @xmath22 , and computing the corresponding critical exponents , janssen showed that the critical behavior along the line connecting the gep and the dp point in  fig .  [ phasediag ] is that of dyp  @xcite . in this sense immunization",
    "is a relevant perturbation , driving the system away from the dp point in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] towards gep .",
    "( we note that in the case of several competing infections with immunization , one observes a crossover back to dp  @xcite .",
    "another four - state generalization leads to in interesting tricritical phenomenon belonging to a different universality class  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently epidemic spreading with immunization appeared in a different context . studying systems with infinitely many absorbing states such as the non - diffusive pair contact process  @xcite , muoz _ et al _ conjectured that these models are described by the same type of field theory as the epfi  @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the frozen absorbing configurations generated by the process provide a local memory of activity in the past which effectively acts in the same way as immunization ( or weakening ) .",
    "meanwhile this conjecture is widely accepted , although some questions concerning the upper critical dimension are still debated  @xcite .    while the mentioned field - theoretic results explain the transition line between the gep and the dp point close to @xmath22 , the critical properties along the horizontal line and in the vicinity of the dp point are less well understood . simulating the langevin equation of the epfi at critical reinfection rate ( corresponding to the horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] ) in 1 + 1 dimensions starting with a localized seed , lpez and muoz initially expected continuously varying exponents  @xcite , but refined simulations and approximations suggest that there is no power - law scaling .",
    "instead , the activity was found to vary as a stretched exponential in 1 + 1 dimensions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the epidemic process with finite immunization , focussing on the influence of immunization in the vicinity of the dp point , especially in higher dimensions @xmath2 . in sec .",

    "this means that we expect a stretched exponential decay instead of power - law behavior not only in one but also in two , three and perhaps four spatial dimensions",
    ". moreover , for @xmath9 , primary infections and reinfections scale differently whereas they show the same scaling behavior for @xmath10 . as a result",

    ", width=340 ]    let us first consider the phenomenological properties of the process near the dp point , where the effect of immunization is small . since the dp point itself is a critical dp process , the question arises how the upper critical dimension of dp influences the generated cluster of immune sites . as a conjecture",
    "we propose that the generated cluster of immune sites at the dp point is _ compact _ in @xmath44 dimensions ( in the sense that its fractal dimension is @xmath29 ) , while in higher dimensions @xmath45 it is not . at the dp point",
    "@xmath46 , the influence of immunization vanishes so that the cluster of immune sites is merely given by the sites visited in the past by a critical dp process . in other words ,",
    "when projecting the past activity of a critical dp cluster onto space ( looking through a critical dp cluster along the temporal axis ) we expect its appearance to be compact in @xmath9 . obviously , in @xmath24 the cluster of visited sites is compact by definition so that the conjecture is correct . in dimensions @xmath47 the statement is non - trivial .",
    "in fact , plotting the projection of a typical cluster in @xmath48 dimensions one obtains a compact object , as shown in fig .  [ cluster ] .    the above conjecture can be supported numerically as follows .",
    "assuming compactness , the number of immune sites in a surviving run should grow linearly with the volume @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the spatial correlation length and @xmath51 is the dynamical exponent of dp ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . averaging over all runs",
    ", the volume has to be multiplied with the survival probability @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , hence the average number of immune sites @xmath54 increases as @xmath55 this implies that the number of _ primary _ infections @xmath39 scales as the derivative of @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath56 as shown in fig .",

    "it is also possible to support the conjecture by a scaling argument .",
    "obviously @xmath54 can not be larger than the integrated past activity @xmath61  @xcite , leading to the inequality @xmath62 as a necessary condition for compactness . in @xmath9 dimensions",
    "the initial - slip exponent @xmath63 is given by the hyperscaling relation  @xcite @xmath64 so that the inequality reduces to @xmath65 , which is indeed satisfied in @xmath9 ( see tab .",

    "@xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , the inequality ( [ in_equ ] ) is sharply satisfied while it is violated above four dimensions .",
    "hence , we can conclude that in @xmath45 dimensions the generated cluster is no longer compact .    to deal with the question whether clusters of immune sites in systems _ at _ the upper critical dimension of dp , @xmath66 , are still compact , it is worthwhile to compare the situation with a simple random walk whose upper critical dimension is @xmath70 .",
    "the random walk is _ recurrent _ in @xmath43 while it is _ transient _ for @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "this means that the probability @xmath72 to visit a given site at least once until time @xmath31 tends to @xmath73 in the limit @xmath74 for @xmath43 while it tends to a constant @xmath75 for @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the region visited by the random walker is compact in @xmath76 whereas it is not in @xmath71 . however , for @xmath48 the probability @xmath77 that the site has not yet been visited decreases asymptotically as @xmath78 in contrast to algebraic behavior in @xmath24 , where @xmath79 .",
    "this implies that in @xmath48 compactness is reached only slowly and we refer to this as _ asymptotically _ compact .",
    "therefore , in @xmath48 and finite time the cluster of visited sites is highly non - compact at its boundaries and differs significantly from the one shown in fig .",
    "[ cluster ] . using this analogy ,",
    "it is near at hand to speculate that the same happens in a critical dp process .",
    "thus , we expect the cluster of visited sites to be compact at the upper critical dimension @xmath66 as well .",
    "however , in this case compactness should be reached considerably slower than for @xmath9 , i.e. , we expect the clusters to be _ asymptotically _ compact .",
    "the observed compactness in low dimensions leads to an important consequence regarding the critical behavior along the horizontal line in  fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] , as it allows the results of  @xcite obtained in @xmath24 to be generalized to @xmath80 and @xmath81 dimensions . in  @xcite the expansion of an immune region in one spatial dimension was studied in the limit of a very small probability of first infections @xmath82 . using a quasi - static approximation",
    "it was shown that the survival probability does _ not _ obey a power law , instead it decays as a stretched exponential @xmath83 giving rise to a _",
    "finite _ survival time @xmath84 . here",
    "@xmath85 with @xmath86 being the order parameter exponent next to a planar absorbing surface  @xcite .",
    "the main assumption made in this approximation is the compactness of the immune domain , wherefore the analysis had been restricted to @xmath24 . because of the observed compactness , the same arguments can be applied in @xmath80 and @xmath81 dimensions so that the formula eq .",
    "( [ survprob ] ) should be valid in these cases as well . inserting the known values for @xmath86  @xcite one obtains @xmath87 in 1@xmath29 and @xmath88 in 2@xmath29 ( so far there are no estimates of @xmath86 in 3@xmath29 ) . whether eq .",
    "( [ survprob ] ) is still valid at the upper critical dimension of dp , @xmath66 , where @xmath89 would be @xmath90 , is not yet clear since in this case we expect the immune region to be only asymptotically compact .",
    "the numerical verification of the stretched exponential behavior for @xmath24 and @xmath91 in  @xcite required a special enrichment method since for small @xmath0 most simulation runs terminate after a very short time . in this paper",
    "we perform ordinary monte carlo simulations and therefore we do not address the numerical analysis of the horizontal line for @xmath91 in @xmath92 .",
    "another important consequence concerns the ratio of first infections and reinfections . in @xmath9 dimensions the average number of first infections @xmath93 ( controlled by the parameter @xmath0 ) decreases according to eq .",
    "( [ n_f ] ) while the average number of reinfections @xmath36 ( controlled by the parameter @xmath1 ) increases as @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "after sufficiently long time the parameter @xmath1 controlling reinfections will have a much larger influence than the parameter @xmath0 . as a consequence the curved phase transition line , which may be thought of as describing a situation where @xmath1 and @xmath0 balance each other , terminates in the dp point horizontally , i.e. with zero slope . in @xmath10 dimensions , primary infections and reinfections",
    "show the same scaling behavior ( for @xmath8 probably affected by logarithmic corrections ) , and therefore we expect the transition line to terminate with a non - vanishing slope .",
    "we will come back to this question in sec .",
    "[ temporal_correlation ] .",
    "the previous phenomenological arguments suggested that the behavior of the model in @xmath9 dimensions differs significantly from the behavior above @xmath96 dimensions .",
    "this difference becomes also obvious when studying the corresponding langevin equations .    according to refs .",
    "@xcite the langevin equation for the epidemic process with finite immunization reads @xmath97 where @xmath98 represents a density - dependent gaussian noise with the correlations @xmath99 it consists of the usual langevin equation for dp plus an exponential term describing the effect of immunization . here",
    "the exponential function can be thought of as a switch : initially , the integral is zero and hence the coefficient of the linear contributions in @xmath100 is @xmath101 , representing as bare parameters the reduced rate for first infections @xmath102 .",
    "however , when the integrated past activity exceeds @xmath103 , the exponential function decreases rapidly so that the additional term is essentially switched off .",
    "roughly speaking , in a continuous description the parameter @xmath104 is needed in order to specify a threshold telling us how much activity has to be accumulated at a given site in order to declare it as immune . once the exponential term is switched off , the linear term is controlled by the coefficient @xmath105 which represents the reduced reinfection rate @xmath106 . in most lattice models ,",
    "sites become immune after a single infection , hence the parameter @xmath104 is of the order @xmath73 while @xmath107 controls the strength of immunization .    rescaling the dp langevin equation by @xmath108 with a scaling parameter @xmath109 and the exponents",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath110 one immediately recognizes that simple scaling invariance at the upper critical dimension @xmath66 can only be established if @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the latter representing the critical point at the mean field level .",
    "regarding the exponential term , scaling invariance requires the argument of the exponential function and the exponential function itself to be dimensionless , hence the coefficient @xmath113 and @xmath104 have to be rescaled as @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "more generally , it can be shown by a field - theoretic calculation  @xcite that in @xmath3 dimensions the two exponents are given by @xmath117 as @xmath118 and @xmath119 are positive , the exponential term for immunization is relevant in @xmath120 dimensions . expanding the exponential function as a taylor series ,",

    "hence , the time scale associated with @xmath145 is expected to be smaller than that associated with a change @xmath146 of @xmath0 . for @xmath10 , primary infections and reinfection show equal scaling behavior and therefore one expects both times to scale in the same way .",
