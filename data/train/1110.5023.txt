    "just like quark flavor mixing , lepton flavor mixing has been observed in a number of neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of lepton flavor mixing is described by a @xmath0 unitary matrix @xmath14 , the so - called maki - nakawaga - sakata - pontecorvo ( mnsp ) matrix @xcite .",
    "there are totally 9 different parametrizations of @xmath14 in terms of the rotation angles and phase angles @xcite . among them , the one advocated by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite is most popular in accounting for current neutrino oscillation data , and the fritzsch - xing ( fx ) parametrization @xcite has a particular merit in describing the running behaviors of neutrino masses and flavor mixing parameters from one energy scale to another by means of the one - loop renormalization - group equations @xcite . is the original kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) parametrization @xcite advantageous to the description of neutrino phenomenology",
    "? we shall give an affirmative answer to this question in the present work .",
    "in fact , it has recently been noticed that the km parametrization of the @xmath15 quark flavor mixing matrix is very useful to link current experimental data to the unitarity triangles the so - called  unitarity boomerang \" @xcite : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the cp - violating phase in the km parametrization and @xmath18 is one of the inner angles of the km unitarity triangles .",
    "a similar relationship was found earlier in the fx parametrization @xcite . as the structure of the km parametrization is partly analogous to that of the fx parametrization and partly analogous to that of the pdg parametrization",
    ", we naturally expect that it should also be useful to describe the salient features of neutrino oscillations in vacuum and in matter .",
    "in other words , we expect that the km parametrization can provide us with a simple and convenient link between its parameters and the observable quantities of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is just to demonstrate our expectation and offer an alternative description of lepton flavor mixing for both the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations and the building of neutrino mass models .",
    "needless to say , a convenient parametrization is sometimes possible to make the underlying physics more transparent",
    ".    the remaining parts of this work are organized as follows :    \\(1 ) in section 2 we shall first establish the explicit relations between the flavor mixing parameters in the km parametrization ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath19 ) and those in the pdg parametrization ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) . because the majorana cp - violating phases have nothing to do with neutrino oscillations , they will not be taken into account in this work .",
    "we find that @xmath24 and @xmath25 hold exactly if the condition @xmath26 ( or equivalently @xmath27 ) is satisfied . because both @xmath21 and @xmath3 are expected to be small , the above condition seems to hint at @xmath28 .",
    "\\(2 ) section 3 is devoted to a detailed calculation of the relations between the genuine km flavor mixing parameters in vacuum ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath19 ) and their effective counterparts in matter ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath29 ) , given neutrino oscillations in a constant terrestrial matter profile .",
    "the so - called toshev relation @xmath30 @xcite in the pdg parametrization is rediscovered in the km parametrization : @xmath31 .",
    "this interesting result means that the km parametrization is definitely useful and convenient to describe the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations . to be more explicit ,",
    "we make analytical approximations for the relations between the genuine and matter - corrected parameters of lepton flavor mixing in two different experimental scenarios : ( a ) the neutrino beam energy @xmath10 is above @xmath11 gev ; and ( b ) @xmath10 is below @xmath11 gev .",
    "the accuracy of each approximation is examined by comparing its results with exact numerical calculations .",
    "such analytical results are phenomenologically useful , just like those obtained previously in the pdg parametrization .",
    "\\(3 ) for illustration , we consider @xmath32 oscillations in section 4 and calculate the oscillation probability by means of the km parametrization .",
    "our expressions are simple and instructive , and they can be used to analyze the upcoming data from t2k @xcite , no@xmath13a @xcite and hyper - k @xcite experiments .",
    "\\(4 ) a brief summary of this work , together with some concluding remarks , is given in section 5 .",
    "in the framework of 3-generation leptons , the km and pdg parametrizations of the mnsp matrix are given by @xmath33 respectively , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "comparing the km parametrization with the pdg parametrization , one can derive the expressions of @xmath40 and @xmath19 in terms of @xmath41 and @xmath23 : @xmath42 with the help of eq . and the current experimental oscillation data @xcite , we find the following properties of @xmath40 and @xmath19 :    * @xmath43 is a good approximation because of @xmath44 as constrained by the present experimental data @xcite .",
    "* @xmath2 depends on not only @xmath22 but also @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath45 is a good approximation if @xmath23 is near @xmath46 , but not good if @xmath23 is near @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "if one requires @xmath49 to hold exactly and @xmath50 , a constraint equation in the pdg parametrization must be satisfied : @xmath51 * when calculating the effective flavor mixing parameters and neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter , one of ten takes @xmath21 as an expansion parameter to make analytical approximations because of its small value ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . since @xmath52 holds , we can also treat @xmath3 as a small parameter to do series expansions . *",
    "the experimental data yield @xmath53 @xcite , leading to @xmath54 from eq . .",
    "so @xmath55 is a good approximation . under the condition of eq .",
    ", @xmath25 holds exactly .",
    "we remark that eq .",
    "is a useful constraint that leads exactly to both @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it can be re - expressed in the km parametrization : @xmath56 moreover , one can see from eqs . and that @xmath57 is equivalent to @xmath25 .",
    "one special case is the @xmath58-@xmath59 flavor symmetry with @xmath60 and maximal cp violation with @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we shall consider this possibility in the next section when discussing matter effects .",
    "we obtain the best - fit values and the @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ranges of mixing angles @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 for both the normal hierarchy ( nh ) and inverted hierarchy ( ih ) of neutrino masses in table 1 , according to a global analysis of current neutrino data presented in ref .",
    "some details of this table should be mentioned .",
    "first , we do not list any possible values of the cp phase @xmath19 because @xmath19 is not well constrained by current experiments . ref .",
    "@xcite gives very loose bounds of @xmath23 , with @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) for the nh ( ih ) at the best fit and @xmath67 to @xmath68 ( @xmath69 to @xmath70 ) for the nh ( ih ) in the @xmath62 range , without constraints in the @xmath63 or @xmath64 ranges . in this case",
    ", one may assume the bounds of @xmath23 as the bounds of @xmath19 for @xmath55 .",
    "second , because we have little knowledge about @xmath23 , @xmath2 can not be well restricted from eq . .",
    "thus we assume @xmath23 at its best - fit value when we calculate the range of @xmath2 in table 1 . for a full understanding of the possible values of @xmath2 and their dependence on @xmath23",
    ", one may see fig .",
    "1 , where we take the nh as an example to show how @xmath2 changes with @xmath23 .",
    "to understand the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations in the long - baseline experiments , it is necessary to analyze neutrino mixing in matter . in this section , we calculate the effective flavor mixing parameters in a constant terrestrial matter profile ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath29 ) and study their relations with the genuine flavor mixing parameters in vacuum ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath19 ) .    in the flavor basis",

    "@xmath77 is the number density of electrons in matter , and it can be taken to be half of the number density of nucleons of the earth . in this case",
    ", @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the mass density along the path of neutrinos . in most long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments",
    ", @xmath80 is approximately a constant @xcite .",
    ". holds for neutrinos .",
    "when considering the evolution of antineutrinos , we have to perform the replacements @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the effective hamiltonian .    in view of eq .",
    ", one may define the effective mnsp matrix @xmath83 through @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the eigenvalues of the matrix in the square bracket of eq . .",
    "the effective matter - corrected mass - squared differences are written as @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    to describe the mnsp matrices @xmath14 and @xmath83 in the km parametrization",
    ", we need three real rotation matrices and one diagonal phase matrix @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 : @xmath92 in which @xmath88 is a rotation matrix in the ( 1,2 ) plane and @xmath89 and @xmath90 are rotation matrices in the ( 2,3 ) plane .",
    "thus @xmath14 and @xmath83 can be parametrized as @xmath93 with the flavor mixing parameters in vacuum ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath19 ) and in matter ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath29 ) , respectively .    in the representation of the rotation matrices and phase matrix , eq",

    "thus , @xmath101 is diagonalized by @xmath102 .",
    "after a phase transformation , one can derive @xmath103 with an additional unphysical phase matrix @xmath104 . comparing it with eq . , we find the following relations : @xmath105 and @xmath106 where @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    ". gives a simple relationship between the genuine and matter - corrected flavor mixing parameters , which is similar to the toshev relation @xcite in the pdg parametrization @xmath109 in which the tildes always stand for the parameters in matter .",
    "we point out that such a similar relationship exists in not only the pdg parametrization , but also the km parametrization and another parametrization denoted as p7 in ref .",
    "] where @xmath110 and @xmath111 . in this parametrization ,",
    "the toshev relation is expressed as @xmath112 .",
    "the reason for the toshev relation being satisfied is that the first rotation matrix on the right - hand side of the mnsp matrix is a ( 2,3 ) rotation matrix in all of these three parametrizations , and it commutes with the effective potential . ]",
    "generally , we call all of them the toshev relations .",
    "we end this part with a direct application of this relation . given the @xmath58-@xmath59 symmetry with @xmath113 and maximal cp violation with @xmath114 in vacuum , both sides of the toshev relation equal @xmath115 , then @xmath116 , leading to @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "thus , we have proved that the @xmath58-@xmath59 symmetry and maximal cp violation keep unchanged when matter effects are taken into account .",
    "together with the pdg and p7 parametrizations , we rewrite the overall invariance of the @xmath58-@xmath59 symmetry and maximal cp violation in three parametrizations as follows : @xmath119 ref .",
    "@xcite provides another proof to this claim in the pdg parametrization , where a special basis of the neutrino fields is taken .",
    "our approximate formulation is based on two premises :    * from table 1 , one can derive @xmath120 ( 0.05 ) for the nh ( ih ) .",
    "so @xmath121 provides a reliable basis for our analytical approximation . *",
    "given small @xmath122 , two scenarios should be considered separately : ( a ) @xmath10 is above @xmath123 gev ; and ( b ) @xmath10 is below @xmath123 gev .",
    "the reason for distinguishing between scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) is simple . in scenario ( b ) ,",
    "where @xmath124 holds , we have to regard @xmath78 as a small parameter ; but in scenario ( a ) with @xmath125 , we do not have to do so .",
    "our first step is to diagonalize @xmath96 in eq . .",

    "although @xmath3 is not close to @xmath21 , it is small enough to do the series expansion in both @xmath3 and @xmath276 by treating @xmath277 . * for neutrinos with @xmath10 above @xmath123 gev , the corrections to the rotation angle @xmath6 and the cp phase @xmath29 induced by matter effects are small and nearly independent of the matter density and the neutrino energy .",
    "this is a salient feature of the km parametrization . * the analytical expressions of the oscillation probabilities in eqs . and are similar to the corresponding expressions in the pdg parametrization .",
    "it is well known that a good parametrization brings much convenience to the description of physical quantities . in this paper",
    ", we have explored the km parametrization to study the neutrino phenomenology .",
