    "we also constructed the models with higher resolutions of modeling parameters than the fine resolution .",
    "but results are not sensitive to the resolutions . *",
    "performing the @xmath0 minimization described above , we found a solution : m = 1.00 @xmath2 , @xmath4 = 1.75 , @xmath7 = 0.0275 , @xmath5 = 0.605 , and t = 6.433 gyr , marked m2 .",

    "this model is able to minimize @xmath24 in the age of 6.556 gyr but has a higher value of @xmath25 .",
    "this implies that increasing the hydrogen abundance and mass at the same time for a fixed value of the mixing length parameter leads to an increase in the @xmath26 in order to attain the same value of @xmath27 .",
    "this scenario was also found by @xcite .",
    "the mean large and small separation of the m1 model is 56.44 and 5.00 @xmath12hz , respectively , which are almost same as those of the m2 model .    in fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows that the differences between the observed and theoretical frequencies are very similar for both models at high frequency , however they are different at lower frequency .",

    "these comparisons between individual observed and theoretical asteroseismic frequencies for the m1 and m2 models do not allow us to differentiate which model is better .",
    "additionally , both models have the almost same values of the mean large and small separations reflecting a similarity of the internal structure between the m1 and m2 models . for example , both models have an almost same helium - core mass .    however , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that both the m1 and m2 models badly reproduce the observed frequencies of @xmath9 = 1 .",
    "we searched the models which can better reproduce the observed frequencies of @xmath9 = 1 .",
    "a model labeled m2b , which was shown in table [ tab3 ] , was found .",
    "however , the value of @xmath24 for the m2b model is larger than * those * of the m1 and m2 models , which is mainly due to differences in the modes of @xmath9 = 1 of these models .",
    "if the contribution to @xmath24 from the @xmath9 = 1 mode near 1238 @xmath12hz is neglected , the value of @xmath24 for the m2b model will decrease from 3.37 to 0.72 .",

    "[ fig6 ] . except for the @xmath9 = 1 mode near 1238 @xmath12hz",
    ", the m2b model reproduces the observed frequencies well",
    ". moreover fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows that the observed and theoretical frequencies with @xmath9 = 1 have a similar behavior : * a zigzag echelle diagram*. the modes of @xmath9 = 1 show up a deviation from their expected asymptotic values .",
    "[ fig7 ] also shows that the large separations for modes of @xmath9 = 1 deviate from their expected asymptotic behaviour .",
    "this may be because that the formation of the central helium core leads to an increase in the frequencies of the g - modes . ` when the frequency of a g - mode approaches that of a p - mode , the two modes undergo an avoided crossing , where they exchange physical nature ' @xcite . figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] show that the @xmath9 = 1 modes of the m2b model between 1200 and 1300 @xmath12hz may undergo the avoided crossing . noting the helium - core mass of the m1 and m2 models are almost same , but that of the m2 and m2b models are different , the behaviour of the @xmath9 = 1 modes might be very sensitive to the internal structure of the stars .",
    "it may be applied to extract the information of the helium core .",
    "we also considered a @xmath24 which does not contain @xmath28 . for models falling within the observed constraints on effective temperature , luminosity and surface metallicity , we computed this new @xmath24 . a solution with m = 0.93 @xmath2 , @xmath4 = 1.75 , @xmath7 = 0.026",

    "the characteristics of the m3 model are given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the systematic difference @xmath28 between computed and observed frequencies is -0.53 @xmath12hz for this model .",
    "however the value of the new @xmath24 is 4.55 , which is much larger than that of the m1 and m2 models .",
    "moreover the echelle diagram of the m3 model is plotted in fig .",
    "this echelle diagram shows that the m3 model can reproduce the frequencies in the range of 1034 @xmath29 1437 @xmath12hz but badly reproduces the modes at the lower and higher frequencies .",
    "moreover its mean larger separation is only 55.49 @xmath12hz .",
    "thus this model is in disagreement with the asteroseismic constraints .",
    "the mass of 1.00 @xmath2 for the m2 and m2b models is less than the value in the previous literatures @xcite , which may result from that the results of @xcite and @xcite were obtained without the asteroseismic constraints .",
    "the initial hydrogen mass fraction is 0.605 and 0.650 for the m2 and m1 model , respectively .",
    "although there is a difference of 0.0015 in z between the m1 and m2 model , the increase of the hydrogen or decrease of helium is mainly compensated by an increase of the mass in order to reach the same location in the h - r diagram : a helium - mass degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the m1 and m2 models have the same value of @xmath27 and the almost same asteroseismic features .",
    "this implies that the helium - mass degeneracy is difficult to be removed , even if the asteroseismic constraints are taken into account .    comparing with the observed frequencies ,",
    "the theoretical frequencies have a systematic shift . *",
    "the mode of @xmath9 = 1 near 1238 @xmath12hz deviate from its expected asymptotic value in fig .",
    "it may undergo an avoided crossing and be a mixed - mode .",
    "the mixed - mode could have higher inertia than other p - modes .",
    "the shift of this mode may be different from that of other p - modes .",
    "thus we divide the @xmath27 into two parts : one @xmath30 for mixed - modes and one @xmath31 for all modes except for mixed - modes . assuming only the @xmath32 mode near 1238 @xmath12hz is a mixed - mode , we obtained the value of this new @xmath27 is 1.07 , 1.10 , 3.61 and 0.72 for m1 , m2 , m2a and m2b , respectively . under this assumption",
    ", m2b has a smallest @xmath27 . *",
    "we confirmed the results that an analysis of the h - r diagram does not allow us to determine the mixing length parameter for an evolved solar - type star @xcite but the observed oscillation frequencies could provide a constraint on this parameter .",
    "the internal structure of the evolved solar - type stars is sensitive to the mixing length parameter at given ( @xmath33 ) .    in this work we constructed the models for the using the yale stellar evolution code . by combining the non - asteroseismic constraints with the asteroseismic observations , we find that a model for @xmath12 her can reproduce the all non - asteroseismic and asteroseismic constraints well : * the model with a mass of 1.00@xmath1 @xmath2 , an age t = 6.433 @xmath3 0.04 gyr , a mixing - length parameter @xmath4 = 1.75 @xmath3 0.25 , an initial hydrogen abundance @xmath5 = 0.605@xmath6 and metal abundance @xmath7 = 0.0275@xmath8 .",
    "however , the models with mass 1 - 1.1 @xmath2 and age @xmath34 gyr also can reproduce the non - asteroseismic and asteroseismic constraints .",

    "the asteroseismic observations put important constraints on the models for , but they are not enough to really test the differences in the models .",
