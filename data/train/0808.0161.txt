    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma - ray bursts are considered as two of the most plausible classes of astrophysical accelerators of extragalactic ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the recent report of the @xcite about clustering of the arrival directions of uhecrs with energies @xmath2 ev within @xmath3 of the directions to agn at distances @xmath4 strongly suggests that effective production of cosmic rays with energies @xmath5 takes place in at least one of these source classes .",
    "because of photohadronic gzk interactions of protons or ions with the cmb radiation , the study of super - gzk uhecrs from sources at @xmath6 becomes impossible with cosmic - ray detectors like the pierre auger observatory @xcite .",
    "powerful agn , as well as grbs , are mostly located at larger distances .",
    "relativistic beams of energy from the central nuclei of agn are thought to power the multi - kpc scale radio lobes of powerful galaxies and form an extended cavity @xcite .",
    "acceleration of uhecrs in the compact inner jets of the radio galaxy on the sub - parsec scale , followed by production of collimated beams of ultra - high energy neutrons and gamma - rays , provides a specific mechanism to transport energy to the radio lobes and cavity @xcite . when the neutron - decay uhecr protons interact with the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , which is dominated by the cmb radiation , ultra - relativistic electrons ( including positrons ) and @xmath1 rays with @xmath7",
    "are produced .",
    "such secondaries can initiate pair - photon cascades to form large multi - mpc scale halos of gev / tev radiation due to compton and synchrotron processes @xcite .    in this letter , we predict that synchrotron gev fluxes from uhecr agn sources are detectable with the fermi gamma ray space telescope ( fgst ; formerly the gamma ray large area space telescope , glast ) if uhecrs are captured in the vicinity of radio galaxies for sufficiently long times .",
    "magnetic fields at the @xmath8 g level in the kpc ",
    "mpc vicinity from the agn core are required to isotropize uhecrs accelerated by jets of radio galaxies .",
    "indeed , for protons with energy @xmath9 , the mean magnetic field @xmath10 required to provide gyroradii smaller than size @xmath11 is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the spatial scale where the isotropization occurs .",
    "here we consider the specific case of the powerful radio galaxy cygnus a , where the mean magnetic field in the surrounding cavity could reach 10  100 @xmath14 g at 100 kpc scales .",
    "its properties are considered in section 2 , and calculations are presented in section 3 .",
    "we summarize in section 4 .",
    "magnetic fields @xmath15 could be present at @xmath16mpc scales in clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "even higher magnetic fields , @xmath17 g , could be present in the @xmath18kpc vicinity of cd galaxies near the center of galaxy clusters like the powerful radio galaxy cyg a @xcite .",
    "in such magnetic fields , synchrotron radiation of electrons with @xmath19 produced in photomeson interactions is in the tev domain .",
    "furthermore , synchrotron radiation of lower energy electrons produced in @xmath20 interactions by uhecrs extends to the gev domain and could become detectable with the fermi telescope .",
    "here we consider the detectability of these fluxes from the powerful and well - studied radio galaxy cyg a.      observations of cygnus a ( @xmath21 , luminosity distance @xmath22 ) by the chandra x - ray observatory show that the central @xmath23 kpc size luminous prolate spheroidal region of cygnus a , called a  cavity , \" can be understood as a shock expanding into the accretion cooling - flow gas @xcite . the kinetic power of expansion of this x - ray cavity deduced by @xcite is @xmath24 erg s@xmath25 .",
    "this is much larger than the total radio luminosity @xmath26 erg s@xmath25 of the two bright radio lobes of cygnus a @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath27 should be considered as a _",
    "lower _ limit to the overall power @xmath28 of cosmic rays injected into the cavity , if the cosmic - ray power is assumed to drive the expansion of the cavity .",
    "a few times larger power , @xmath29 ergs s@xmath25 therefore seems a reasonable assumption .",
    "this value is in a good agreement with the `` neutral beam '' model @xcite , which explains the collimated relativistic x - ray jets that remain straight up to @xmath30 mpc distances in sources such as pictor a @xcite as the result of energy transport by beams of uhe neutrons and gamma - rays .",
    "these linear x - ray features , surrounded by a broader and less collimated radio structure in pictor a , and coincident with narrow radio structures exhibiting bends and deflections in cyg a @xcite , terminate in x - ray hot spots . because of the large inclination angle , the x - ray jets in cyg a can not be detected .",
    "however detection of bright x - ray hot spots located at @xmath31 distances on opposite sides of the nucleus @xcite strongly implies production of collimated x - ray jets also in cyg a.    detailed calculations in the framework of this model show that neutral beams of ultrarelativistic neutrons and @xmath1 rays , produced by the compact relativistic jets in the central sub - parsec scale environment of frii galaxies , can take a few percent of the total power of this inner jet . that energy is then deposited , after @xmath32-decay of neutrons @xmath33 , on distance scales @xmath34 , and also via photopair production of uhe gamma - rays through the process @xmath35 .",
    "these secondary charged relativistic particles initially form a beam in the same direction as the jet , and can effectively interact with and transfer momentum and energy to the ambient magnetized medium , and thus can be the basic energy reservoir for the jet at large distances from cyg a. the total radio luminosity @xmath36 detected from the lobes of cyg a @xcite imposes the minimum power requirement for the beam . given the @xmath37 efficiency of neutral beam production , the acceleration power of the crs in the relativistic inner jet must be @xmath38 .",
    "this power is then released in crs when the inner jet decelerates to subrelativistic speeds in the dense medium at kpc scales .",
    "this scenario is in agreement with the assumption that the expansion of the cavity against the cooling flow observed @xcite at distances @xmath39  100 kpc is powered by cosmic - ray pressure .",
    "protons are accelerated in the inner jet of cyg a to a maximum energy @xmath40 ev , consistent with size scales and magnetic fields inferred from a synchrotron model of blazars corresponding to cyg a if observed along its jet .",
    "this value of @xmath41 is in accord with the spatial extent of the x - ray hot spot where the large - scale jet terminates due to the @xmath32-decay of the remaining high - energy neutrons in the beam . at this distance ,",
    "the injection power from the decaying neutrons is balanced by the ram pressure of the external medium .",
    "thus , for @xmath42 kpc - long jets originating from neutral beams , the inner jets must accelerate protons to @xmath43ev . in our model",
    ", we assume that acceleration of uhecrs to @xmath44 ev occurs .",
    "the lower limit to the equipartition magnetic field in the radio lobes of cyg a inferred from radio observations is @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field in the cavity derived from x - ray observations is @xmath46 @xcite",
    ". moreover , the field outside the cavity could also be very high given the large thermal electron energy density inferred from the x - ray emission at @xmath47 or in the @xmath48kpc environment around cyg a. the pressure of hot thermal gas decreases from @xmath49 erg @xmath50 in the regions near the cavity to @xmath51 erg @xmath50 at distances @xmath52 kpc from the center of cyg a @xcite .",
    "the corresponding equipartition magnetic fields would then vary from @xmath53 to @xmath54 at the periphery of this region .",
    "the duration of injection of uhecrs , i.e. , the jet injection age , represents one of the important parameters of the model .",
    "@xcite find that the expansion age of the cavity , determined from the speed of the shock deduced from the analysis of x - ray data , is @xmath55yr .",
    "the injection age can be larger than this dynamical age because the derived value neglects the magnetic - field pressure of the intracluster medium ( icm ) upstream of the shock , as recognized by @xcite .",
    "also , this age estimate neglects the infall velocity of the cooling flow . for the total mass @xmath56 enclosed at @xmath57 distances @xcite , the virial speed @xmath58 , where @xmath59 cm is , formally , the schwarzschild radius for the total mass @xmath60",
    "the value of @xmath61 gives a measure of the accretion / cooling flow velocities at radius @xmath11 , and is comparable to the average @xmath62 speed of the shock derived by @xcite in the rest frame of the fluid upstream of the shock .",
    "these factors can significantly decrease the speed of expansion of the cavity in the stationary frame , so that the real injection age of the cavity can be significantly larger than the age inferred by @xcite .",
    "we now estimate the age of activity of the black - hole jet from energetics arguments .",
    "the inferred jet power , @xmath63 , corresponds to @xmath64 of the eddington luminosity for a black - hole mass @xmath65 in cygnus a @xcite . to produce such power ,",
    "the black hole should accrete mass at the rate @xmath66 with an efficiency @xmath67 , with @xmath68 .",
    "the age of the central black hole is estimated by its growth time @xmath69 , giving an upper estimate for the jet s age as the jet might be active for only a fraction of the bh growth phase .",
    "these estimates are in accord with the characteristic jet age @xmath70 yr inferred from a model for `` cocoon '' ( or cavity ) dynamics by @xcite .",
    "the maximum confinement timescale @xmath71 of uhecrs in a source of size @xmath11 is given in the bohm diffusion approximation by @xmath72 , where the bohm diffusion coefficient @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the larmor radius of a particle with charge @xmath75 . from this expression",
    "we obtain the uhecr proton confinement time @xmath76 for @xmath77 kpc and @xmath78 g , @xmath79 myr for @xmath80 ev protons .    0.2 in [ f1 ]    fig .",
    "[ f1 ] compares timescales @xmath81 for energy losses due to photomeson and photopair production with values of @xmath71 for characteristic parameters @xmath82 kpc and @xmath83 g in the region surrounding cyg a. also shown is the value of @xmath84 yrs for the assumed injection age .",
    "the fraction of energy of accelerated protons that could be extracted is given by @xmath85 .",
    "this figure shows that @xmath86% of the total energy of uhecrs with @xmath87 ev can be extracted through photohadronic processes .",
    "because of the increased confinement time and the much lower production threshold for photopair than photomeson processes , the photopair process can make a comparable or dominant contribution to the electromagnetic channel compared to photomeson processes .",
    "0.2 in [ f2 ]    fig .",
    "[ f2 ] shows @xmath1-ray fluxes calculated for the electromagnetic cascade initiated by the injection of @xmath88 s@xmath25 of uhecr protons into the cavity , and further cosmic ray interactions with the ebl in the @xmath89 region surrounding cyg a. even though the ebl is dominated by the cmbr , interactions with the diffuse infrared / optical radiation are also included in the calculations , using the ebl of @xcite .",
    "the injection spectrum of uhecr protons is a power - law with an @xmath90 number spectral index with a low - energy cutoff at @xmath91 tev and a high - energy exponential cutoff at @xmath92 ev .",
    "we assume a mean magnetic field @xmath93 .",
    "escape of particles is given by the bohm diffusion approximation in a single zone model .",
    "the method of calculation follows the approach described by @xcite .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dot - dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] show the contributions to the fluxes from the photohadronic secondary electrons and the first two generations of cascade electrons for injection ages @xmath94 .",
    "the secondary electrons also include the electrons from @xmath95-decay @xmath1 rays that convert promptly into electron - positron pairs inside the source . in the strong magnetic field of the cyg a environment ,",
    "the compton flux is dominated by synchrotron radiation from the photohadronic secondaries and the first generation of cascade electrons .",
    "the open dots , full dots and stars in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] show the received @xmath96 spectral energy fluxes for injection ages @xmath97myr , 100myr and 300myr , respectively .",
    "the lower and higher energy peaks in the spectral energy distributions primarily result from photopair and photomeson processes , respectively .",
    "the sensitivities for a one - year , @xmath98 detection of a point source with the fgst in the scanning mode , galactic latitude of cyg a due to galactic background . ] and for a 50 hour , 5@xmath99 detection with veritas are shown .",
    "the lower bound of the veritas sensitivity applies to a point source , and the upper bound to a source of @xmath100 extent .",
    "if the radio lobes of cyg a are powered by uhecr production from the inner pc - scale jets , then trapping of these particles in the surrounding strong magnetic - field region leads to the production of secondary @xmath1 rays that should be significantly detected with the fgst in one year of observation if the jet injection age is @xmath101 myr .",
    "if radio galaxies are not the sources of uhecrs , then cygnus a will not be detected by the fgst .",
    "cyg a could also be detected with veritas in a 50 hour pointing , depending on the duration of activity of the central engine and the level of the ebl .",
    "detection of gev @xmath1 rays from cyg a with the fgst might also be expected to arise from other processes .",
    "the @xmath102  100 gev radio - emitting electrons from the lobes of radio galaxies will compton - scatter cmb photons to mev",
    " gev energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the strong magnetic field , @xmath103 g , in the lobes of cyg a , however , the ratio of the magnetic - field to cmbr energy densities is @xmath104 .",
    "thus the total energy flux of compton - scattered cmbr from cyg a is @xmath105 erg s@xmath106 \\cong 4\\times   10^{-13}$ ] ergs @xmath107 s@xmath25 , with the @xmath108 flux a factor of @xmath109  10 lower . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , this process is almost two orders of magnitude below the uhecr - induced synchrotron flux , and well below the fgst sensitivity .",
    "@xcite considered fluxes expected from the @xmath110 halos of clusters of galaxies with weaker magnetic fields , @xmath111-@xmath112 g in a model where acceleration of uhecrs occurs in accretion shocks in the cluster . because of lower maximum energies of accelerated protons , @xmath113 , and lower magnetic fields , this model predicts hard spectral fluxes of compton origin peaking at tev energies .",
    "@xcite predicted that synchrotron radiation from @xmath114 electrons is produced by secondaries of uhecrs that leave the acceleration region and travel nearly rectilinearly through weak intergalactic magnetic fields at the level @xmath115 ",
    "@xmath116 g . these sources would appear as point - like quiescent gev  tev sources with spectra in the gev domain as hard as @xmath117 , and very soft , @xmath118 spectra in the 100 gev ",

    "in contrast to both these models , we predict soft 0.1  1 gev spectra with @xmath119 and hard , @xmath120 spectra at tev energies due to the much higher magnetic field in the confinement region . these models can be clearly distinguished if cygnus a is resolved by the fermi gamma ray space telescope or the ground - based @xmath1-ray telescopes , as the emission region in our model subtends an angle @xmath121 .    because cygnus a lies outside the gzk horizon , only uhecrs with energy below the gzk energy could be correlated with this source .",
