    "detached eclipsing binary stars ( debs ) are the primary source of fundamental stellar quantities : mass @xmath3 and radius @xmath4 .",
    "both components must be spectroscopically detectable for direct determination of these quantities .",
    "modern astronomical instrumentation and analytical methods enable a high accuracy and precision to be reached , reducing errors in the masses and radii for the stars in binaries to 1% or less ( e.g.  pilecki  2013 ) . a critical examination of published analyses found 95 systems satisfying the criterion of 3% in the uncertainties for @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( torres  2010 ) .",
    "the debcat catalogue lists 159 systems .    for a useful comparison with theoretical evolutionary models further observables",
    "are needed : effective temperature , @xmath5 , and metallicity , [ m / h ] .",
    "only the ratio of the @xmath5s of the two stars is provided by the light curve analysis .",
    "the @xmath5  of one component must be determined from other sources , e.g.  spectral energy distribution , colour indices , or spectral type estimates .",
    "far worse is the situation with empirical determination of the components metallicity . of the 95 systems listed by torres  ( 2010 ) , fewer than half have an empirically estimated metallicity .",
    "detailed abundance studies has been performed for only four systems , including two from our own work ( see sect .  5 . ) .",
    "the method of doppler tomography ( bagnuolo & gies 1991 ) , and its generalisation as spectral disentangling ( simon & sturm 1994 , hadrava 1995 ) enables the study of the individual spectra of the components of binary star systems .",
    "this is particularly useful for the determination of @xmath5  and metallicity ( c.f.pavlovski & southworth 2012 , and references therein ) .",
    "since the structure and evolution of a star depends on its chemical composition , the degeneracy in the location of a star in evolutionary diagrams can only be broken if an empirical metallicity is known .",
    "in the last two decades a new generation of stellar evolutionary models has been developed ( c.f .",
    "maeder & meynet 2012 , langer 2012 ) .",
    "the inclusion of stellar rotation has had profound effects on these models ( meynet & maeder 2000 , heger & langer 2000 , heger  2000 ) .",
    "centrifugal force changes the stellar shape and structure , causes meridional circulation and induces turbulent mixing . in turn , the @xmath5  and luminosity of the rotating star changes , affecting its liftime . as a consequence ,",
    "the surface abundance pattern changes too , heavily affecting the expected photospheric nitrogen abundance .",
    "the calculations predict an increase in nitrogen abundance with increasing stellar mass , increasing initial rotational velocity , and decreasing metallicity .",
    "this makes nitrogen abundance viable as a new observable ( khler  2012 ) .",
    "however , caution is needed since hunter  ( 2009 ) have found from the observations of a large sample of the galactic and magellanic clouds b stars the relation between nitrogen enhancement and stellar parameters ( mass and projected rotational velocity , @xmath6 ) to be more complex than predicted from the models .",
    "subsequently , morel  ( 2008 ) did not find any tight correlation of the nitrogen abundance with the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "this was also supported by extension of the analysis to o stars ( martins  2012 ) .",
    "recently , comprehensive grids of theoretical stellar evolutionary models incorporating rotation have been available by the utrecht ( brott  2011 ) and geneva ( ekstrm  2012 ) groups .",
    "these models differ in the treatment of rotational mixing , as well as in the calibration .",
    "brott  ( 2011 ) tailored their grids of different initial composition to match the results of vlt - flames survey of massive stars in the magellanic clouds and the galaxy ( evans  2005 ) . in consequence ,",
    "their models have no scaled - solar composition , and result in a rather low metallicity for galactic stars , z@xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , ekstrm ( 2012 ) use scaled - solar compositions , and galactic models are represented with the metallicity z@xmath8 .",
    "the complexity of composite spectra of close binaries makes the study of the individual stellar spectra extremely difficult .",
    "shifts of the spectral lines due to the orbital motion of components in binary or multiple systems are essential for the determination of stellar masses .",
    "spectral lines overlap for much of each orbital cycle , and the secondary star may be much fainter than the primary , and thus contribute only a small fraction of the total light of the system . to these problems should be added the intrinsic broadening of spectral lines in ob stars , and high @xmath6 in binaries .",
    "all these pose a difficulty for accurate measurements of radial velocities ( rvs ) for the components , lowering the accuracy of the derived stellar masses ( c.f .",
    "andersen 1991 , torres  2010 ) or making the fainter star impossible to detect . since the first spectroscopic detection of binary stars in the last decades of the 19th century , binary star spectra have been used almost solely for rv measurement .",
    "important astrophysical information contained in these spectra was ignored due to the inability of researchers to extract individual spectra of the components .",
    "the method of _ spectral disentangling _ ( spd ) is the way to avoid these obstacles .",
    "bagnuolo & gies ( 1992 ) successfully applied the method of doppler tomography and isolated component star spectra for the case when the rvs of the individual exposures were already known .",
    "simon & sturm ( 1994 ) generalised tomographic separation by setting a matrix equation from a time - series of binary star spectra .",
    "a set of linear equations is solved directly for the orbital elements and the component spectra , thus bypassing the determination of rvs entirely .",
    "an independent formulation of the equations of spd in the fourier space by hadrava ( 1995 ) has been particularly advantageous since the calculations are more efficient and computationally less demanding .",
    "an overview of spd and its variants is given by pavlovski & hensberge ( 2010 ) .        in comprehensive studies of v578mon , hensberge  ( 2000 ) and",
    "pavlovski & hensberge ( 2005 ) constructed a complete procedure for the analysis of spectroscopically double - lined eclipsing binary stars . in the core of the procedure",
    "is spd , which yields the optimal set of orbital elements and isolated individual spectra of the components .",
    "further , the analysis of these spectra provides the atmospheric parameters for the components : @xmath5s , metallicity , detailed abundances and @xmath6 values . in turn",
    ", the atmospheric parameters are fed back into fine - tuning the light curve solution . in an iterative cycle",
    "an optimal set of stellar and binary parameters can be achieved .",
    "further development and applications are given in pavlovski & southworth ( 2009 ) and pavlovski et  ( 2009 ) .",
    "this scheme makes possible the determination of the fundamental quantities ",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5   with the accuracy needed for a useful comparison to theoretical models .",
    "complementary observables hold an important possibility in the analysis of binary and multiple stars .",
    "only a complementary solution of astrometric and spectroscopic measurements could yield a complete set of the orbital elements and its space orientation . with the recent tremendeous development in interferometric capability",
    ", many more spectroscopic binaries have been spatially resolved .",
    "the stability and quality of the solution in spd could be supported with constraints from external observables such as interferometric measurements ( kolbas & pavlovski , this proceedings ) .",
    "an important step in the analysis is determination of the @xmath5s for the stars in binary systems , directly from renormalised disentangled spectra .",
    "the traditional degeneracy between @xmath5  and surface gravity can be lifted for the stars in binary systems .",
    "the surface gravities for these star can be determined with uncertainties below 0.01dex .",
    "a promising and important new development is modelling of the composite spectra for tidally and rotationally distorted stars in binary system given in palate  ( 2013 ) .",

    "so far , we have observed and analysed a dozen binary stars with high - mass components .",
    "their location in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) is shown in fig.1 along with theoretical evolutionary tracks and isochrones .",
    "the majority of the stars are in early phases of their main - sequence evolution , with the youngest systems being v573car and v578mon .",
    "the stars in our sample are late - o to early - b , i.e.  at the lower end of the high - mass stars .",
    "the largest masses are 2025m@xmath0 for the components of v1034sco , dncas and hd164258 .",
    "their @xmath9 values range from @xmath1030kms@xmath2 ( v621pera ; southworth in preparation ) to 250kms@xmath2 ( hd164258a ; mayer  2013 ) . of the systems studied , v380cyg , v453cyg and v621per are the most informative as their primary components are evolved to either close to or beyond the terminal - age main sequence ( tams ) .",
    "here we described some principal results and summarise published results for the most important systems .",
    "+        * v578mon * ( hd259135 , bd+4@xmath111299 ) is an eccentric deb , in the young open cluster ngc2244 embedded in the rosette nebula , with orbital period 2.408d .",
    "hensberge ( 2000 ) determined the absolute dimensions of the components from @xmath12 photometry and high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "they found the binary to consist of b1v + b2v stars with masses 14.5 and 10.3m@xmath0 , radii 5.2 and 4.3r@xmath0 , and @xmath9 values 114 and 98kms@xmath2 .",
    "the age inferred from isochrone fitting was estimated to be @xmath103myr .",
    "garcia  ( 2011 , 2013 ) provided the first measurement of the apsidal motion period and improved the orbital and stellar parameters .",
    "a new comprehensive analysis of all available photometric data plus a new chelle spectroscopy with mercator / hermes , has allowed a fine - tuning of the physical properties and the internal structure of the stars ( garcia  2014 ) .",
    "the photospheric chemical composition of the components has been determined using disentangled spectra ( pavlovski & hensberge 2005 ) .",
    "their analysis was done relative to sharp - lined b1v star # 201 in ngc2244 for which accurate abundances are known ( vrancken  1997 ) .",
    "the abundance pattern for both stars is consistent with those found for several b1 stars in ngc2244 ( vrancken  1997 ) . + * v453cyg * ( hd227696 ) is totally eclipsing deb for which accurate physical properties have been measured ( southworth 2004a ) .",
    "the system consists of two b stars with masses 14.4 and 11.1m@xmath0 .",
    "the more massive component is approaching the tams whilst its companion has completed about half of its main - sequence lifetime .",
    "these characteristics make v453cyg ideal for probing the main - sequence chemical evolution of high - mass stars .",
    "the photospheric chemical composition of the components was determined by pavlovski & southworth ( 2009 ) .",
    "the more massive component is the only star in our sample which shows the trend in cno abundances expected on theoretical grounds ( sect.2 , see also przybilla , this volume ) . in fig.3",
    "the observational results are presented for the three samples : single b stars ( nieva & przybilla 2012 ) , single magnetic b stars ( morel  2008 ) and b stars in close binaries ( this work ) .",
    "the trend in the changes of abundance ratio between n / o and n / c is governed by the cno cycle and stellar evolution ( przybilla  2010 ; przybilla , this volume ) . + * v380cyg * ( hd187879 , kic5385723 ) is an eccentric deb with an evolved b - type component ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "a large discrepancy between the dynamical and evolutionary masses for this component has been found .",
    "guinan  ( 2000 ) removed this mass discrepancy by invoking extremely strong convective core overshooting .",
    "pavlovski  ( 2009 ) tried unsuccesfully to match the giant component to the rotating evolutionary models of ekstrm  ( 2008 ) .",
    "as a potential candidate for stochastic pulsations , concerted effort has been put in to observe the binary photometrically with the _ kepler _ satellite , and spectroscopically with mercator / hermes ( tkachenko  2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "this has allowed revision of the absolute dimensions and atmospheric diagnostics for both components even though the secondary contributes only about 6% of the total light of the system .",
    "the measured chemical composition for the giant component corroborates our previous study ( pavlovski  2009 ) .",
    "spectral disentangling of a large collection of high - resolution spectra also makes possible a study of the secondary component .",
    "its composition agrees with the primary s to within the uncertainties .",
    "n / c and n / o are characteristic for unevolved b stars , despite one of the component having evolved to the giant stage .",
    "+ * v621per * ( bd+56@xmath11576 ) is a totally eclipsing binary system , and a member of the young open cluster @xmath14per ( ngc884 ) .",
    "the primary star is an early - type subgiant ( southworth  2004b ) . in an extensive photometric campaign on @xmath14per ,",
    "complete multicolour light curves of this long - period ( @xmath15 d ) binary have been obtained ( saesen 2010 ) .",
    "an application of spectral disentangling reveals the secondary component which makes possible the determination of the absolute dimensions of the components ( southworth in preparation ) .",
    "it is found that the subgiant component has @xmath16m@xmath0 , and @xmath17 .",
    "its helpfully low rotation rate ( @xmath18kms@xmath2 ) , allows an accurate determination of its atmospheric parameters and chemical composition .",
    "we find that the nitrogen and carbon abundances do not show the theoretically predicted excess , thus corroborating our results for the giant component of v380cyg .",
    "we have determined the photospheric abundances for helium and cno elements in high - mass stars in close binaries .",
    "we do not find any dependence on their masses , rotational velocities or evolutionary status except for the marginal case of v453cyga .",
    "the obvious question is : are high - mass stars in detached binary systems fundamentally different to single high - mass stars for which changes in the photospheric abundances have been disclosed observationally ( hunter  2009 , przybilla  2010 , see also przybilla this volume ) ? obviously , tidal effects have some effect on the stellar structure and evolution , and may hinder rotationally induced mixing in high - mass components in close binary systems .",
    "this was calculated and discussed by de mink  ( 2009 , 2013 ) .",
    "however , a significantly larger sample is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn .",
