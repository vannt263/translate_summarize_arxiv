    "we model a single fmo monomer as a network of @xmath1 sites ( see fig .  1 ) , which can be described by a general hamiltonian @xmath2where the state @xmath3 represents an excitation at site @xmath4 ( @xmath5 1, ... ,7 )",
    ", @xmath6 is the site energy of chromophore @xmath4 , and @xmath7 is the excitonic coupling between the @xmath4-th and @xmath8-th sites . for simplicity , here the recently discovered @xcite eighth site has been omitted because results of molecular dynamics simulations @xcite suggest that this site plays a minimal role in the processes we are interested in .    in the bacterial photosynthesis ,",
    "the excitation from the light - harvesting antenna enters the fmo complex at sites 1 or 6 and then transfers from one site to another .",
    "when the excitation gets to the site 3 , it hops irreversibly to the reaction center . in the regime that the excitonic coupling @xmath9 is large compared with the reorganization energy , the electron - nuclear coupling can be treated perturbatively @xcite , and the dynamics of the system can be governed by the quantum liouville equation .",
    "the strong coupling between the excitonic dynamics and the fmo environment , as well as the structure of that environment , will quantitatively affect the excitation transfer  @xcite . here , however , we wish to focus on the interplay between the excitation transfer and the sp scattering ; so we focus on the simplest possible model of such environmental effects .",
    "this allows us to clearly identify in what way defects in the fmo complex affect the sp scattering .",
    "a full investigation of the environment influence will be considered in future work . also , it should be noted that excitonic fluorescence relaxation is not included in the liouville equation .",
    "this is because its time scale ( @xmath10 ns ) is much longer compared with that of the excitation transfer from site 3 to the reaction center ( @xmath10 ps ) , the typical excitation transfer time across the complex , and the dephasing @xcite ( @xmath11 fs ) , such that this relaxation process can then be omitted for simplicity .    * the surface plasmon and fmo hybrid system . * as shown in fig .  1 , we consider a metal nanowire that is placed close to the fmo complex , as a substitute for the light - harvesting antenna found _ in vivo_. a sp with energy @xmath12 incident from the left end of the wire can be strongly coupled @xcite to both sites 1 and 6",
    ". here , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the group velocity and wave vector of the incident sp , respectively , and @xmath13 is set to be unity throughout this paper .",
    "the incident sp can then be scattered by the two sites , due to these strong sp - site couplings .",
    "alternatively , it can be absorbed by these two sites and be dissipated due to loss in the fmo complex .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath15 of this sp - fmo hybrid system can be written as @xcite @xmath16 , with @xmath17,\\notag\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 stands for the energy of the sps with @xmath19 being the creation operator of the @xmath14-mode sp , @xmath20 denotes the interaction between the sps and the sites of the fmo complex . in @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the separation between site 1 and 6 , while @xmath22 denotes the raising operator for site 1 ( 6 ) . here",
    ", the coupling strength @xmath23 between the sps and site 1 ( 6 ) is assumed to be independent of @xmath14 under the markovian approximation @xcite .",
    "the strong decay rate into sps then takes the form @xcite , @xmath24 , and the values we choose for @xmath25 and @xmath26 are consistent with a recent analysis of nanowire sps coupled to j - aggregates @xcite .",
    "when the sp is propagating on the surface of the metal nanowire , it inevitably suffers from dissipation , such as ohmic loss , that can be described by a markovian channel .",
    "thus , here we include the markovian channels for irreversible excitation transfer from site 3 to the reaction center , as well as the ohmic loss , by introducing non - hermitian terms in the total hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , since we are interested in time - independent solutions of the photon state , the effect of quantum jumps @xcite on the dynamics is neglected , such that the phonon dephasing leads to population reduction in our model .",
    "we therefore simply include the phonon dephasing as a non - hermitian term .",
    "while this introduces extra population loss , it allows us to include in a simple way the broadening effect of dephasing on the sp spectra . the site energy of the fmo complex in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is then modified as @xmath27 where @xmath28 are mostly zero , except for the rates referring to the markovian channels , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . here , the ohmic loss rate @xmath31 is set to be @xmath32 @xcite . note that the separation between site 1 and 6 is about 1 - 2 nm @xcite , which is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident sp .",
    "therefore , one can set the separation @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , since the separation is small compared with the distance ( @xmath34 30 nm ) that sps propagate during the dephasing time of scattering @xcite , we neglect plasmon dephasing .",
    "note that we only include @xmath35 on sites @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and neglect dephasing for other sites , because the broadening of these sites , which couple to the sps , typically dominates the scattering spectra @xcite .",
    "the energy eigenstate of the hybrid system with an energy matching the incident sp , @xmath38 , can be written as @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 describes that the fmo complex is in the ground state with no sps , and @xmath41 stands for that the excitation is in the site @xmath4 , while @xmath42 is the probability amplitude that the site @xmath4 absorbs the excitation .",
    "we also assume that the sp field is incident from the left of the waveguide , the scattering amplitudes @xmath43 and @xmath44 therefore take the form , @xmath45,\\notag\\\\ \\phi _ { k , l}^{\\dag } ( z)&\\equiv & r~\\textrm{exp}(-ikx)\\theta(-x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the transmission and reflection amplitudes , respectively , and @xmath48 is the unit step function .",

    "this real - space total hamiltonian can be applied to the energy eigenstate [ eq .  ( [ ek ] ) ] .",
    "the transmission spectrum @xmath54 and the probability amplitudes @xmath42 can then be obtained by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath55 .",
    "note that in the following calculations , we employ the energies and excitonic couplings from ref .",
    "[ 50 ] for the fmo hamiltonian .",
    "the rate of excitation transfer from site 3 to the reaction center is set to be @xmath56 ps , and the dephasing rate @xmath57 , proportional to the temperature @xcite , is chosen to be 77 @xmath58 .    * detecting defects from changes in the scattering spectra . * it has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite that each chromophore in the fmo complex can be decoupled from its nearest site due to rotations of the chromophore or mutation - induced local defects . this can lead to damage of the chromophores , such as blocked energy pathways or entirely non - functional sites . here",
    "we first calculate the transmission spectra of the incident sp field in the presence of defects in the fmo complex , and compare them to the case without any defects . as can be seen in fig .  2",
    ", the black - solid curve shows the transmission spectrum of the incident sp field for the normal fmo complex .",
    "the dips in the spectrum correspond to the the eigenenergies of the hybrid system , i.e. , the dips occur when the sites resonant with the sp reflect the incident field @xcite .",
    "the reason why the dips do not reach zero is because here we have included dephasing and the irreversible excitation transfer from site 3 to the reaction center .",
    "these dissipative channels decrease the amplitude of the dips . as seen in fig .  2",
    ", the red - dashed curves show the transmission spectra when certain excitonic couplings are inhibited .",
    "the differences between the red - dashed and black - solid curves can indicate the occurrence of a blocked transfer pathway . however , the spectral differences in fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( d ) are larger than those in fig .",
    "2(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "this is because in the normal case these sites are strongly coupled , and thus when suppressed the inhibition strongly affects not only the eigenenergies , but also the quantum coherence @xcite in the site basis . on the other hand , the transmission spectra in fig .",
    "2 show typical fano lineshapes @xcite stemming from the interference between discrete ( the sites ) and continuous channels ( the sps ) .",
    "as the inhibition of the relatively strong coupling @xmath59 , between sites @xmath60 and @xmath37 leads to the enhancement of the coherence between other the sites of the fmo complex , the fano resonance is strongly altered [ fig .",
    "this result is consistent with our previous work @xcite on the dynamics of the excitation transfer in fmo complex .",
    "similarly , mutation - induced defects or local environment modification @xcite can also lead to the disconnection of the chromophores from the fmo complex entirely , rather than just suppression of certain couplings . in fig .  3",
    ", we plot the transmission spectra for the cases where certain sites with relatively large excitonic couplings are removed entirely .",
    "the differences between the black - solid ( the normal situation ) and red - dashed curves can again indicate this drastic alteration of the complex .",
    "one interesting question can be raised here , can one distinguish the following two situations : ( i ) inhibiting a strong excitonic coupling , and ( ii ) totally removing one of the sites which contains the very excitonic coupling entirely ?",
    "the answer is yes . by comparing fig .  2 and 3",
    ", the inhibition of the transfer pathway only results in changes of the transmission spectra , but the missing site case also leads to vanishing peaks / dips , indicating the removal of an eigenstate of the system .",
    "note that in plotting fig .  2 and 3",
    ", we assume the sp - site couplings to be symmetric , i.e. , @xmath61 @xmath58 . in the following section",
    ", we will discuss the effects of asymmetric couplings .",
    "so far we have shown that local defects or missing sites can be detected via changes in the transmission spectra of the incident sp . however , if these changes in the transmission spectra can be enhanced , then the observations of such an effect in experimental realizations would become more feasible .",
    "we have observed that the transmission spectra contain fano lineshapes , thus we can predict that a discrepancy between the discrete ( the fmo sites ) and continuous ( the sps ) channels will strongly affect the behavior of such fano resonances @xcite .",
    "larger changes in the transmission spectra can then be achieved by making these two channels more disparate . in fig .  4",
    ", we show the transmission spectra when inhibiting @xmath62 [ fig .",
    "4(a ) ] and entirely removing the site 2 [ fig .",
    "4(b ) ] with asymmetric sp - site couplings",
    "@xmath63 ( @xmath64 @xmath58 , @xmath65 @xmath58 ) . the changes in the transmission spectra are enhanced compared to those in fig .",
    "2(a ) and fig .  3(a ) , respectively .",
    "this is because when the damage ( pathway - inhibition or missing site ) occurs to site 2 , the coherence between other sites in the fmo complex increases @xcite , and the large ratio @xmath66 reduces the communication between discrete and continuous channels . as a result , the two channels become more disparate , leading to an enhancement in the transmission spectra .",
    "similar results can also be obtained as shown in fig .  5 by either inhibiting @xmath59 [ fig .",
    "5(a ) ] or completely removing site 5 [ fig .  5(b ) ] .",
    "correspondingly , the asymmetric couplings here are chosen as inverse of the previous example @xmath67 ( @xmath68 @xmath58 , @xmath69 @xmath58 ) .",
    "again we see that the changes in the transmission spectra are enhanced compared with those in fig .",
    "2(b ) and fig .",
    "3(b ) . more importantly , in fig .  5",
    ", we can see that when site 5 is disconnected from the fmo complex , the sharp fano lineshape on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "5 is smeared out .",
    "since @xmath62 ( @xmath70104.1 @xmath58 ) is larger than @xmath59 ( 89.7 @xmath58 ) , we would expect this effect to be obvious in fig .  4 , but it is not .",
    "this reveals that site 5 is very distinct from other sites , consistent with our previous work @xcite .",
    "since the fmo protein complex is in reality a trimer , the validity of the results obtained by studying the monomer alone shall be addressed here .",
    "typically studies have shown that the subunits of the trimer act as separate transport channels @xcite from the antenna to the reaction center .",
    "on the other hand , the site - couplings of a monomer were found to be increased because of the other monomers in the trimer system @xcite .",
    "this suggests that studying individual fmo monomers is sufficient to get a qualitative understanding @xcite , but that in a full trimer system the precise monomer eigenenergies may be altered .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that by observing the scattering of an incident sp , coupled to sites 1 and 6 of the fmo complex , both the inhibition of the excitonic coupling ( excitation - transferring pathway ) and entirely missing sites can be detected .",
    "we also show that by making the discrete ( sites ) and the continuous ( sps ) channels more disparate , it is possible to further enhance the changes in the transmission spectra of the incident sp . these results provide an alternative method to detect the mutation - induced local defects or the non - functional sites in the fmo complex .",
    "we expect that future work will reveal even more uses for such hybrid bio - sensors , including probing the role of quantum coherence and environmental effects in photosynthetic complexes .",
