    "blind signature is a form of digital signature in which the message is blinded before it is signed , in order to allow the requester to get a signature without giving the signer any information about the actual message or the resulting signature .",
    "blind signatures are used to build practical offline and online untraceable electronic cash schemes @xcite and widely employed in privacy - related cryptographic protocols , such as electronic election systems @xcite . the paper analogy to the blind signature is enclosing a ballot in a carbon paper lined envelope ; in this way , the signer does not view the message content , and also everyone can later check the validity of the signature .",
    "several blind signature schemes are proposed in the literature .",
    "the first scheme , proposed by chaum @xcite , was based on rsa signature . in @xcite , okamoto proposed the blind schnorr signature and pointcheval et al . proved its security in @xcite . in 1995 , camenisch et al .",

    "proved its untraceability @xcite .",
    "pointcheval developed a blinding scheme for okamoto s signature in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "huang et al . presented a blind signature scheme based on gost signature , which is the russia s digital signature algorithm @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "an efficient blind signature scheme is presented based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a gost - like blind signature scheme and three efficient educed schemes based on elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem .",
    "the schemes utilize the inherent advantage of elliptic curve cryptosystems in terms of smaller key size and lower computational overhead compared to its counterpart public key cryptosystems such as rsa and elgamal .",
    "the schemes are proved to be correct and secure .",
    "they can be used in various cryptographic protocols where the anonymity of the requester is required .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "basic concepts of elliptic curves are presented .",
    "the gost digital signature scheme is described in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "the generalized scheme and three other educed schemes are elaborated and the security and performances are discussed .",

    "the elliptic curve analogues of dlp - based schemes was independently proposed by koblitz @xcite and miller @xcite , in 1985 . since then , several cryptosystems are developed based on elliptic curve computations .    a non - super singular elliptic curve @xmath0 over a finite field @xmath1 is as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 . the point @xmath4 , where @xmath5 satisfy equation [ eq : first ] , together with a point at infinity , denoted by @xmath6 , form an abelian group @xmath7 whose identity element is @xmath6 .",

    "there are two participants in a blind signature scheme : a signer and a group of requesters .",
    "initially , the signer publishes the necessary information .",
    "then , the user sends a blinded version of the message to the signer .",
    "the signer signs the blinded message , and sends the result back to the user .",
    "afterwards , the user extracts the signature . at the end",
    ", the validity of the signature is verified .",
    "the details of these phases are described below .",
    "* initialization : * first , the curve parameters must be agreed upon by signer and requester .",

    "the correctness can be easily proved as follows : @xmath58      the security of blind signature schemes is defined by unforgeability and blindness . here , we discuss these properties of the proposed blind signature scheme .",
    "* unforgeability : * forgery is an attack trying to fabricate a digital signature for a message without having access to the respective signer s private key .",
    "the security requirement of unforgeability of digital signatures is also called non - repudiation .    to forge a valid blind signature ,",
    "the adversary should obtain the signature @xmath59 or the signer s private key @xmath42 to fabricate the signature @xmath60 .",
    "it is impossible to obtain @xmath42 from the public key @xmath44 using the equation @xmath45 , because it is based on ecdlp . to forge @xmath59 , a dishonest requester ( as an adversary )",

    "thus , the unforgeability of the scheme is assured .",
    "* blindness : * a signature scheme is called blind , if the signer s view and the resulting signature are statistically independent .",
    "the signer s view is the set of all values that the signer gets during the execution of the signature issuing protocol , which in the proposed scheme is the tuple @xmath64 .",
