    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) has been confirmed by many astronomical observations , but the nature of dm is still an open question .",
    "many kinds of particles in theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) are proposed as dm candidates @xcite .",
    "the dm particles are usually stable due to the protection of some discrete symmetry . for example , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in the usual supersymmetric ( susy ) model is stale due to the conservation of r - parity , and is a well motivated candidate for dm @xcite .",
    "generally there are three kinds of strategies to detect the dm particles : the `` collider search '' at large colliders such as large hadron collider ( lhc ) or international linear collider ( ilc ) ; the `` direct detection '' to find the signal of nuclei recoil when dm particles scatter off the detector ; the `` indirect detection '' to search for the products from dm annihilation or decay , such as neutrinos , photons and anti - matter particles .",
    "it is usually a big challenge for indirect detection due to the difficulty in discriminating the signal from the astrophysical background",
    ". therefore precise measurements with wide energy range and improved resolution are necessary for dm indirect detection .",
    "pamela is a satellite borne experiment designed to measure the cosmic rays ( crs ) in a wide energy range with unprecedented accuracy @xcite .",
    "recently , the pamela collaboration released the first data about antiprotons and positrons @xcite .",
    "usually it is thought that antiprotons and positrons are produced when crs propagate in the milky way and collide with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the abundance of these secondaries can be calculated with relatively high precision . however , the pamela results show an obvious excess in the faction of @xmath3 at energies above @xmath0 gev .",
    "interestingly the excess keeps to rise up to energy @xmath4 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum of antiprotons fits the prediction quite well .",
    "these results confirm the previous results by heat @xcite and ams @xcite within the error bars .",
    "the pamela results may provide a direct evidence of dm in the way of `` indirect detection '' .",
    "however , before resorting to the exotic physics of dm , it is necessary to go through the possible astrophysical sources to account for this results .",
    "the model - independent spectral shape analysis shows that there might be most likely a primary source with @xmath5 pairs required to explain the rise of the positron fraction @xcite .",
    "the non - excess of the antiproton data @xcite also favors a leptonic origin of the positrons .",
    "pulsar is thought to be a good candidate to produce only leptons , and was used to explain the previous heat data @xcite .",
    "the recent analysis show that the pamela data can also be fitted considering the contributions from nearby pulsars such as geminga and b0656 + 14 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that another interesting conclusion in ref.@xcite shows that the uncertainties of the propagation of crs , the production cross section of secondary particles and the errors of electron measurements might lead to the underestimation of the positron fraction , and the `` excess '' is actually not an excess .    as one possibility , the contribution from dm annihilation or decay is also widely discussed .",
    "the scenarios about dm annihilation include ( i ) annihilation to sm particle pairs , like gauge boson , quark and lepton pairs @xcite ; ( ii ) virtual internal bremsstrahlung process to @xmath6 @xcite ; ( iii ) annihilation to new mediating particle pair which would decay to @xmath5 @xcite , etc",
    ". however , in the dm annihilation scenario , an unnatural large `` boost factor '' is necessary to reproduce the pamela positron data .",
    "another problem is that the non - excess of the @xmath7 data will set constraint on the properties of annihilating dm @xcite , which makes the model building difficult .",
    "considering the difficulties to explain the large positron excess by annihilating dm , we propose to solve the problem using decaying dm in the present work .",
    "if there exists some tiny symmetry violation , the dm particles can decay very slowly to sm particles .",
    "the decaying dm models are studied extensively in literatures to explain the observational data @xcite or set constraints on the decay properties of dm @xcite .    for the self - consistence of this work",
    ", we first studied the process of cosmic ray propagation carefully , and give realistic propagation models to produce the background contributions to positrons and antiprotons from cr interaction with ism .",
    "the dm induced positrons and antiprotons are calculated in the same propagation models .",
    "we find that the pamela data can be well fitted for a leptonically decaying dm ( lddm ) model . the results for different decay final states are discussed in detail . and a possible model in the susy frame with r - parity violation is proposed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the propagation of crs and give the updated positron and antiproton background estimations . in section iii , we present a model - independent approach to recover the pamela data and discuss why we need the decaying dm whose decay products are mainly leptons . in section iv , we give an example of this lddm model and discuss another possibility . finally we give the summary and discussion in section v.",
    "in this section we will study the cosmic ray propagation model carefully so that we can predict the positron and antiproton spectra to compare with the pamela data .",
    "the charged particles propagate diffusively in the galaxy due to the scattering with random magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the interactions with ism and interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) will lead to energy losses of crs . for heavy nuclei and unstable nuclei",
    "there are fragmentation processes by collisions with ism and radiactive decays respectively . in addition",
    ", the overall convection driven by the galactic wind and reacceleration due to the interstellar shock will also affect the distribution function of crs .",
    "the propagation equation can be written as@xcite & = & q(*x*,p)+(d_xx-*v_c*)+p^2d_pp + & - & -- , [ prop ] where @xmath8 is the density of cosmic ray particles per unit momentum interval , @xmath9 is the source term , @xmath10 is the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath11 is the convection velocity , @xmath12 is the diffusion coefficient in momentum space used to describe the reacceleration process , @xmath13 is the momentum loss rate , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are time scales for fragmentation and radioactive decay respectively .",
    "we describe a bit more about the relevant terms in eq.([prop ] ) in the follow .    for primary particles such as the protons and some heavy nuclei ,",
    "the source function is the product of two parts : the spatial distribution @xmath16 and energy spectrum @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath16 can follow the distribution of possible sources of crs , such as the supernova remnants ( snr ) @xcite .",
    "the injection spectrum @xmath18 is usually assumed to be a power law or broken power law function with respect to momentum @xmath19 . for secondary particles",
    "the source function is given according to the distributions of primary crs and ism @xmath20 , \\label{secsource}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the density of primary crs , @xmath22 is the velocity of injection crs , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the cross sections for the secondary particles from the progenitors of h and he targets , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the interstellar hydrogen and helium number densities , respectively .",
    "the spatial diffusion is regarded as isotropic and described using a rigidity dependent function @xmath27 the reacceleration is described by the diffusion in momentum space .",
    "the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath12 relates with the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath10 as@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the alfven speed , @xmath30 is the ratio of magnetohydrodynamic wave energy density to the magnetic field energy density , which characterizes the level of turbulence .",
    "@xmath30 can be taken as @xmath31 and the reacceleration is determined by the alfven speed @xmath29@xcite .    the convection velocity , which corresponds to the galactic wind , is assumed to be cylindrically symmetric and increase linearly with the height @xmath32 from the galactic plane@xcite .",
    "it means a constant adiabatic energy loss of crs .",
    "@xmath33 is adopted to avoid the discontinuity across the galactic plane .",
    "finally the energy losses and fragmentations can be calculated according to the interactions between crs and ism or isrf .",
    "for some simplified cases the propagation equation ( [ prop ] ) can be solved analytically using the green s function method@xcite . however , generally it is not easy to find the analytical solution .",
    "a numerical method to solve this equation has been developed by strong and moskalenko , known as the galprop model @xcite . in galprop , the realistic astrophysical inputs such as the ism and isrf are adopted to calculate the fragmentations and energy losses of crs .",
    "the parameters are tuned to reproduce the observational cr spectra at earth .",
    "it is shown that the galprop model can give relative good descriptions of all kinds of crs , including the secondaries such as @xmath34 , @xmath35 and diffuse @xmath36-rays@xcite .",
    ".the propagation parameters in the dc and dr models . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these neutralinos generally have life time around @xmath37 to account for the pamela data .",
    "it is much longer than the life of the universe which makes these neutralinos as valid dark matter .",
    "however , the tiny value of @xmath38 means we can not test the scenario directly at lhc or ilc . in tab .",
    "[ dcdr ] we give the life time and value of @xmath38 for the different benchmark points to account for the pamela positron excess .    .",
    "the neutralino mass in each line is increasing from left to right .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=316 ] . the neutralino mass in each line is increasing from left to right . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=316 ]    in fig .",
    "[ neu ] , we show the positron fraction including contribution from neutralino decay for different benchmark points . from fig .",
    "[ neu ] , we can see the positrons are most probably distributed lower than @xmath39 .",
    "this is due to the three - body decay and the roughly equal decay fraction of @xmath40 .",
    "the positron spectrum given here with three - body decay is generally softer than two body final states with monochromatic lepton .",
    "we notice that neutralino heavier than 300gev to about @xmath41 tev can fit the pamela data well . if one takes account the results from ppb - bets and atic experiments , it seems to suggest a heavy neutralinos up to @xmath42tev if they are due to dm decay .",
    "another feature of this scenario is neutrino flux from neutralino decay , but we find this neutrino flux is too small to be detected by neutrino telescope such as super - kamiokande , icecube , etc while which is well within the atmospheric neutrino bound from super - kamiokande(similar analysis for neutrino flux from decaying dm can be found in ref.@xcite ) .    .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=316 ] . , title=\"fig:\",width=316 ]    finally we will give some comments on other scenarios of decaying dark matter . in some susy scenarios",
    ", the lsp may be the neutral particles as gravitino or sneutrino",
    ". they can also be the candidates of dm .",
    "however , in the bilinear r - parity violation scenario , the gravitino would mainly decay into gauge boson plus lepton @xcite which is not favored by antiproton data from pamela .",
    "if the r - parity violation term is @xmath43 as we discussed above , the spectrum of decay products is similar .",
    "but the decay of gravitino is suppressed by the planck scale and the r - parity violation parameter can be as large as @xmath44 , which may lead to unstable nlsp decay quickly to avoid destroying the success of big - bang nucleosynthesis @xcite and be observable at colliders @xcite .",
    "another possible candidate of dm in susy is sneutrino .",
    "the left - handed sneutrino has been ruled out by dm direct detection , therefore the right - handed sneutrino receives more concerns .",
    "if we neglect all the soft breaking terms , the interactions for right - handed neutrino superfeild @xmath45 are induced only from yukawa term @xmath46 . after introducing only bilinear r - parity violation terms @xmath47",
    ", the right - handed sneutrino will decay into lepton pairs with a large fraction , due to mixing between higgs and left - handed lepton superfields .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that mixing between right - handed sneutrino and higgs boson can not be avoided in general .",
    "these mixing terms have to be suppressed in order not to conflict with pamela antiproton data .",
    "the kinematical conditions can be used to suppress the right - handed sneutrino decay to two higgs or one higgs plus one lepton . to suppress the lsp direct decay to quarks which is induced by the mixing of right - handed sneutrino and higgs ,",
    "an extra relation @xmath48 is needed for the j - th generation right - handed sneutrino which is the lsp . in",
    "the ref.@xcite authors proposed similar idea , they assume the lsp is the third generation right - handed sneutrino and only @xmath49 , then the small yukawa coupling @xmath50 make this right - handed sneutrino as a good candidate of lddm .",
    "the difference between leptonically decaying neutralino and right - handed sneutrino might be represented in the original positron spectrum .",
    "the former one is softer than the latter , because the former one is three - body decay while the latter one is two - body decay .",
    "it means that the pamela implication on dm mass is different for these two scenarios . with the synergy of pamela and collider experiments , it is possible to distinguish whether the dm is neutralino , gravitino or right - handed sneutrino",
    "the recent released pamela data shows interesting features , that the positron shows an obvious excess above @xmath0 gev while the antiproton flux is well consistent with the expectation from the conventional cosmic ray model .",
    "the result implies there should exist some kinds of primary positron sources in addition to the secondaries from crs interactions with the ism .    before the discussion of possible exotic sources of positrons it is extremely important to explore the background carefully . in this work",
    "we first recalculate the background contributions of positron and antiprotons from crs using galprop . considering the cr data of unstable secondaries , such as @xmath51be/@xmath52be , it is possible to reduce the uncertainties in predicting the positron and antiproton flux from the propagation parameters @xcite .",
    "two typical propagation models , the diffusion+convection and diffusion+reacceleration ones , are adopted as benchmarks of the cr propagation models . in both of the two models , propagation parameters",
    "are adjusted so that most of the cr spectra , such as b / c , @xmath51be/@xmath52be and so on , are well consistent with the observation . the dc model is found to be consistent with the @xmath7 and the low energy @xmath53 data of pamela without introducing a charge - dependent solar modulation model . while the dr model shows a bit of underestimation of the @xmath7 data and produce more low energy positrons . in both models",
    "the positron fraction at high energies shows obvious excess .",
    "we then consider dm origin of the primary positrons .",
    "we compared the positron and antiproton spectra with pamela data by assuming the annihilation or decay products are mainly gauge bosons , quarks and leptons respectively .",
    "we find the pamela data exclude quarks being dominant final states , disfavor gauge bosons and favor the leptonic final states .",
    "comparing annihilating dm and decaying dm scenarios , we prefer decaying dm because annihilating dm usually requires very large boost factors .",
    "moreover , annihilating dm usually produce more gauge bosons and quarks than leptons .",
    "a concrete example of such lddm model is considered in mssm with tiny @xmath54 r - parity violation term .",
    "we choose neutralino as the lsp and the dm particle .",
    "we show that neutralino with mass @xmath55 gev and life time of @xmath2 seconds can fit the pamela data very well .",
    "we also demonstrate that neutralino with mass around 2tev can fit pamela and atic data simultaneously .",
    "another lddm model is right - handed sneutrino being dm with bilinear r - parity violation term . with the interplay of pamela and lhc it is possible to distinguish the dm between neutralino and right - handed sneutrino .",
    "finally we will discuss the implications of the lddm models .",
    "lddm can have many interesting phenomena in experiments other than pamela , such as gamma ray observation .",
    "in general , it can have two - body decay and three - body decay channels as @xmath56 and @xmath57 where the leptons in the final - states are required from pamela data .",
    "particle x can be photons @xmath58 , neutrino @xmath59 in general . if the lddm has the decay channel @xmath60 , the spectrum of gamma ray can reveal the property of lddm and the mechanics behind . for example , if there is an intermediating resonance particle y which decays to lepton pairs , the decay of lddm is now @xmath61 . thus the photon is monochromatic and can be explored by the fermi gamma ray space telescope(fgrst ) .",
    "detecting the gamma ray spectrum will be an important way to test the lddm model , where fgrst will play an important role .    for our neutralino lddm model the neutrino observation will provide a way to test the model since the decay produces hard neutrino spectrum .",
    "another possible way to test the model is to look for the synchrotron emission of the hard electrons and positrons by dm decay .",
    "further studies on this issue are on going .",

    "<S> the positron and anti - proton spectra can be explained simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the decaying and annihilating dark matter scenarios to account for the pamela results and prefer to the decaying dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> finally we consider a decaying neutralino dark matter model in the frame of supersymmetry with r - parity violation . </S>",
    "<S> the pamela data is well fitted with neutralino mass @xmath1 gev and life time @xmath2 seconds . </S>",
