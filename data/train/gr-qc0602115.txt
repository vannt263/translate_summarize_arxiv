    "the past year has seen a remarkable leap in progress toward a numerical solution of the binary black hole problem .",
    "the first stable evolution of an entire merger process  orbit , merger , ringdown and gravitational wave extraction  was presented in  @xcite using a harmonic formulation of the field equations .",
    "shortly afterwards two groups  @xcite independently achieved similar success using a modified form of the bssn ( or nok )  @xcite formulation of the field equations .",
    "these first results all focused on the merger of equal mass , non - rotating black holes , and follow - up studies  @xcite are now honing in on a consistent picture of the gravitational waves emitted by such an event . recently",
    ", similar techniques to those employed in  @xcite were successfully used to study unequal mass mergers  @xcite and provide estimates of the `` kick '' velocity imparted to the final black hole , and in  @xcite the effects of black hole spin , aligned and anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum , were studied , demonstrating that in the aligned case some orbital `` hang - up '' occurs to radiate away the excess angular momentum .",
    "one reason why the new results seem like such a leap is that progress during earlier years had been rather slow and arduous .",
    "for example , it had taken roughly 7 years from the first simulation of a fraction of a non head - on collision  @xcite to a full orbit@xcite , with many groups making advances along the way .",
    "much of the effort was also ( and still is ) focused on understanding the underlying structure of the field equations of general relativity , and why they are so problematic to discretize successfully in many cases .",
    "nevertheless , the manner in which advances had been made over the pass decade suggested a similar series of `` baby steps '' toward a future solution , which is why the results of the past year have been so exciting .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to describe in detail certain aspects of the generalized harmonic ( gh ) evolution scheme that are of relevance to the simulation of binary black hole ( bbh ) spacetimes , as first presented in  @xcite .",
    "this is not a comprehensive overview of the code or technique , and could be viewed as a supplement to  @xcite ( and see also  @xcite for an excellent description of gh evolution ) .",
    "a secondary goal is to relate progress on an ongoing effort to understand the nature of bbh spacetimes produced by scalar - field collapse .",
    "it is arguable how relevant such spacetimes may eventually be to gravitational wave detection efforts , nevertheless they offer an easy route to explore a wide range of bbh parameter space .",
    "one interesting though tentative result from this early study is that the zoom - whirl type behavior seen in geodesics around black holes may also be present in bbh orbits involving comparable mass components . in particular",
    ", what is shown is that for equal mass binaries on non - circular orbits , and with appropriate fine - tuning of the initial conditions , the black holes approach one another , `` whirl '' around for several orbits , then separate again .",

    "consider a spacetime describe by the line element @xmath0 , metric tensor @xmath1 and coordinates @xmath2 ds^2=g_ab dx^a dx^b , and the einstein field equations in the form [ efe ] r_ab=8(t_ab - g_ab t ) , where @xmath3 is the ricci tensor , @xmath1 is the metric tensor , @xmath4 is the stress energy tensor with trace @xmath5 , and units have been chosen so that newton s constant @xmath6 and the speed of light @xmath7 are equal to 1 .",
    "the ricci tensor is defined in terms of the christoffel symbols @xmath8 ^c_ab= g^cevia [ ricci ] r_ab=^d_ab , d - ^d_db , a + ^e_ab^d_ed -^e_db^d_ea the notation @xmath9 and @xmath10 is used interchangeably to denote ordinary differentiation of some quantity @xmath11 with respect to the coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "_ harmonic coordinates _ are defined by the following set of four conditions on the four spacetime coordinates : [ harm_def ] x^c = 0 , where @xmath12 is the usual covariant scalar wave operator : x^c = _",

    "a(g^ac ) . introduce a set of _ arbitrary source functions _ @xmath13 into the definition ( [ harm_def ] ) : [ gharm_def ] x^c = h^c .",
    "note that in contrast to harmonic coordinates ( [ harm_def ] ) , gh coordinates ( [ gharm_def ] ) are _ not _ conditions on the spacetime coordinates  any geometry in any coordinate system can be expressed in gh form with ( [ gharm_def ] ) defining the corresponding source functions .    using the definitions above , and defining @xmath14 ,",
    "the einstein equations ( [ efe ] ) can be rewritten in the following equivalent form , which shall be referred to as the generalized harmonic decomposition of the field equations : g^cdg_ab , cd + g^cd_(,a g_b)d , c + h_(a , b ) - h_d ^d_ab + + ^c_bd^d_ac = - 8(t_-g _ [ efe_h]t ) the utility of the gh decomposition in a numerical evolution ( as first carried out in  @xcite , and also  @xcite ) comes from considering the @xmath15 as _ independent functions _ ; ( [ efe_h ] ) then becomes a set of ten manifestly hyperbolic equations for the ten metric elements @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath15 are now four independent functions , one needs to provide four additional , independent differential equations to solve for them , schematically written as [ he ] l_c h_c = 0  .",
    "@xmath16 is a differential operator that in general depends on the spacetime coordinates , metric and source functions . to complete the specification of the system one needs to provide evolution equations for matter sources , which couple to the field equations through the stress energy tensor",
    "the only matter field considered here is a massless scalar field @xmath17 that satisfies the wave equation @xmath18 and has a stress energy tensor @xmath19 a solution to ( [ efe_h ] ) , ( [ he ] ) and ( [ phi_eom ] ) will be a solution to the einstein equations as long as the gh condition ( [ gharm_def ] ) is satisfied for all time . in theory , this is straight - forward to achieve .",
    "define the gh constraint functions @xmath20 by c^a h^a - x^a .",
    "[ c_def ] any solution to the einstein equations must have @xmath21 . using the contracted bianchi identity and conservation of stress energy ,",
    "one can show that @xmath20 satisfies the following homogeneous wave equation [ h_const ] c^a = - r^a_b c^b .",
    "therefore , what needs to be done to ensure that ( [ efe_h ] ) , ( [ he ] ) and ( [ phi_eom ] ) satisfy the einstein equations for all time @xmath22 is to choose initial conditions for @xmath1 and @xmath23 such that @xmath21 and @xmath24 at @xmath25 , boundary conditions on @xmath1 and @xmath23 such that @xmath21 on the boundary for all time , and couple this to matter that conserves stress energy .",
    "then ( [ h_const ] ) guarantees that @xmath21 throughout the interior 4-volume of the spacetime .    of course , things are not as simple as this in practice . in a numerical simulation",
    "one can only satisfy the conditions described in the preceding paragraph to within the truncation error of the numerical scheme .",
    "again , in principle this is not a problem , however it turns out that in many situations the truncation errors grow too rapidly to achieve useful results given limited resolution .",
    "there is good evidence that one of the reasons for the rapid growth of truncation error is _ not _ a poor choice of a numerical algorithm , rather ( [ h_const ] ) admits rapidly growing solutions ( so called `` constraint violating modes '' ) given initial data where @xmath20 is of order the truncation error . an effective way of dealing with this problem is the addition of _ constraint damping _ terms to the equations .",
    "as introduced by gundlach et al.@xcite , building on the idea of so - called @xmath26 systems  @xcite , the field equations with constraint damping are g^cdg_ab , cd + g^cd_(,a g_b)d , c + h_(a , b ) - h_d ^d_ab + + ^c_bd^d_ac + ( n_(a c_b ) - g_ab n^d c_d ) + = - 8(t_-g _ t),[efe_h_cd ] where @xmath27 is a parameter multiplying the new terms , @xmath28 a timelike vector , and @xmath29 are the constraints ( [ h_const ] )",
    ". since the new terms are proportional to the constraints , a solution to the einstein equations ( [ efe ] ) will also be a solution to ( [ efe_h_cd ] ) ; furthermore , for general solutions of ( [ efe_h_cd ] ) the constraints still satisfy a homogeneous wave equation c^a = - r^a_b c^b + 2_b,[new_cp ] and thus the prescription outlined in the previous section for obtaining valid solutions to the einstein equations can also be applied using ( [ efe_h_cd ] ) instead of ( [ efe_h ] ) .",
    "gundlach et al .",
    "have shown that for perturbations about minkowski spacetime , all finite wavelength solutions to ( [ new_cp ] ) are exponentially damped in time .",
    "it is not known whether similar modifications to other forms of the field equations can be made that will also have this desirable constraint damping property , though in  @xcite it was shown how to apply constraint damping to the @xmath30 formalism  @xcite , and recently lindblom et al.@xcite described a first order symmetric hyperbolic version of the gh decomposition with constraint damping . in a first order form of the equations additional constraints are introduced that could also exhibit poor behavior with regards to being satisfied in a numerical evolution , though  @xcite describe an effective method for dealing with this problem .    in",
    "@xcite it was suggested that @xmath31 in ( [ efe_h_cd ] ) could be any timelike vector field ; here , for simplicity , @xmath31 is chosen to be the unit timelike vector normal to @xmath32 surfaces .",
    "specifically , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 being the usual _",
    "lapse function_.      within the gh decomposition one can think of the source functions @xmath23 as representing the four coordinate degrees of freedom available in general relativity .",
    "there are many conceivable ways of choosing @xmath23see  @xcite for a more general discussion of some possibilities , and  @xcite for coordinate conditions that might be readily applicable to gh evolution .",
    "the focus here will be on one class of equations that have proven useful for binary black hole evolutions , namely : h_t = - _ 1 + _ 2 h_t , n^[t_gauge ] ,  h_i=0 .",
    "this equation for @xmath35 is a damped wave equation with forcing function designed to prevent the lapse from deviating too far from its minkowski value of @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 controls the damping term , and @xmath38 regulate the forcing term .",
    "the gh numerical code descrided here tends to develop instabilities in pure harmonic gauge when the lapse function becomes on the order of @xmath39 near the horizon of black holes ; equation ( [ t_gauge ] ) prevents this from happening .",
    "it is unclear whether the instabilities are numerical in nature or an indication that the harmonic gauge is developing a coordinate pathology .",
    "however , this is not a crucial question to answer at the moment given the limited availability of computational resources to fully explore the issue , and that ( [ t_gauge ] ) works well . in sec .",
    "[ sec_cdg ] examples of the effect of ( [ t_gauge ] ) with a few different parameters are shown .",
    "an easy way to produce binary black hole `` initial '' data is to use scalar field gravitational collapse . at @xmath25",
    "one begins with two lorentz boosted scalar field profiles with initial amplitude , separation and boost parameters to approximate the kind of orbit that the black holes , which form as the scalar field collapses , will have . on roughly the light crossing time scale of the orbit the remnant scalar field that did not fall into either black hole propagates away from the vicinity of the orbit , leaving behind a good approximation to a vacuum bbh system .",
    "the procedure used to calculate the initial geometry is based on standard techniques  @xcite .",
    "one starts with a metric written in adm  @xcite form [ adm ] ds^2 = -^2 dt^2 + h_ij ( dx^i +",
    "^idt)(dx^j + ^jdt ) , where as before @xmath40 is the lapse , @xmath41 the shift vector and @xmath42 is the metric intrinsic to @xmath43 surfaces .",
    "the extrinsic curvature of @xmath42 is defined as k_ij= - h_i^l h_j^m _",
    "m n_l.[kdef ] in the adm decomposition the hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations take on the following form : ^(3)r + k^2 - k_ab k^ab = 16 , [ hc ] + _ b k_a ^b -_a k = 8j_a [ mc ] , where @xmath44 is the trace of the ricci tensor of the spatial metric , @xmath45 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature , @xmath46 is the energy density and @xmath47 the momentum density of the matter in the spacetime : & = & t_ab n^a n^b , + j_a & = & - t_lm h^l_a n^m .",
    "[ stress ] for the results described here the following initial conditions for the geometry are chosen at @xmath25 : the spatial metric and its first time derivative is conformally flat : h_ij|_t=0 = _ ij[cflat ] + _ t h_ij|_t=0 = _ t _ ij where @xmath48 is the conformal factor , and @xmath49 is the flat euclidean metric ; the initial slice is _ maximal _ :",

    "this set of five coupled elliptic equations is solved using multigrid techniques as described in  @xcite . for boundary conditions",
    "the metric is assumed to be the minkowski metric ( and these conditions are applied _ exactly _ , as a coordinate system compactified to spatial infinity is used ) . for scalar field collapse initial data no `` inner '' boundary conditions are needed as there are no black holes present in the initial slice .",
    "after the elliptic equations are solved for @xmath50 and @xmath41 , ( [ max_slice_a ] ) is algebraically solved for the initial value of @xmath51 , and similarly the conditions ( [ ic_harm ] ) together with the definition ( [ gharm_def ] ) is used to solve for the initial values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "once all the initial values and first time derivatives of the metric in adm form ( [ adm ] ) are known , it is straight - forward to convert these to initial conditions for the 4-dimensional metric @xmath1 needed for the gh system of equations ( [ efe_h_cd ] ) .",
    "in addition to ( [ ic_harm ] ) , the first time derivative of @xmath35 is needed for initial conditions to ( [ t_gauge ] ) , and this is chosen to be : _",

    "the scalar field initial data is constructed by first taking a spherical , time symmetric gaussian profile in a minkowski rest frame @xmath54 : ( t=0,x,y,z ) & = & a ( - ) + _ t ( t=0,x,y,z ) & = & 0,[sf_id ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constant parameters , and @xmath57 .",

    "the remainder of this section contains a discussion of how certain properties of the solution are measured , and a few technical details of the code : position dependent dissipation and constraint damping parameters , and how some robustness problems in the apparent horizon finder are dealt with .      here",
    "a brief summary is given of how black hole properties are measured and gravitational waves are extracted from a numerical solution .    at present only the apparent horizons and not event horizons of black holes are searched for in the solution .",
    "black hole masses are estimated from the ah area @xmath55 and angular momentum @xmath67 , and applying the smarr formula : @xmath68 the angular momentum of horizons are calculated using two methods .",

    "the second method , following  @xcite , is to measure the ratio @xmath71 of the polar to equatorial proper radius of the horizon , and use the formula that closely approximates the function for kerr black holes : @xmath72    to calculate the gravitational waves emitted by the binary the newman - penrose scalar @xmath73 is used , with the null tetrad constructed from the unit timelike normal @xmath74 , a radial unit spacelike vector normal to @xmath75 coordinate spheres , and two additional unit spacelike vectors orthogonal to the radial vector .",
    "far from the source , the real and imaginary components of @xmath73 are proportional to the second time derivatives of the two polarizations of the emitted gravitational waves .",
    "the following formula  @xcite is used to estimate the total energy @xmath76 emitted in gravitational waves , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the complex conjugate of @xmath73 , and the surface integrated over in ( [ ep ] ) is a sphere of constant coordinate radius @xmath79 .",
    "however , before applying this formula @xmath73 is filtered by eliminating all but the @xmath80 spin weight @xmath81 spherical harmonic components @xmath82 , which are the dominant modes of the gravitational wave .",
    "this eliminates some high - frequency `` noise '' that is present in the bare waveform ( primarily from mesh - refinement effects ) , however the integrated energies in the filtered vs. unfiltered waveform do not differ by more than @xmath83 at most in a typical simulation .",

    "described here all characteristics of the differential equations being solved are _ assumed _ to be directed into the boundary .",
    "thus , no boundary conditions are placed on the excision surface ; rather , the difference equations are solved there using modified finite difference operators that do not sample points in the computational domain that are excised ( see  @xcite for details ) .",

    "[ sec_num_details ] . an ah is search for with sufficient frequency that the black hole does not move by more than a single grid point in any direction between ah searches .",

    "this works well during most of the evolution , though near the time of the merger the flow method tends to become unstable .",
    "if an ah is `` lost '' the simulation crashes shortly afterwards as the excision surface is unable to track the motion of the black hole , and soon a domain exterior to the black hole is excised .",
    "one of the factors that seems to cause this behavior in the ah finder is relatively poor resolution of the underlying numerical solution .",
    "so one cure would be to allow additional refinement about the black holes .",
    "however , experiments have shown that increasing the resolution only near the black holes does not increase the accuracy in the overall solution , so this would be a computationally expensive solution merely to help the ah finder .",
    "of course , a better solution would be to develop a more robust ah finder ( see  @xcite for a review of methods ) , and this path will be pursued in future work .    in leu of a more robust ah finder the following `` tricks '' are used to push the evolution through the merger point . when the flow method becomes unstable , what typically happens is @xmath105 decreases to some minimum value @xmath107 , then begins to increase and eventually diverge .",

    "this extrapolation is rarely need for more than @xmath112 .",
    "note that when the ah finder fails and either a less accurate or extrapolated shape is used , this shape only guides the position and orientation of the excision surface , _ not _ its size .",
