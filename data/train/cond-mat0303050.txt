    "current experiments on the collisional properties of a fermi gas in two spin - polarized states under confinement have proven that this setup provides an important tool for investigating the dynamics of dilute quantum gases .",
    "for such a system in harmonic trapping the existence of zero and first sound excitations has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite and numerically  @xcite by measuring the damping of the oscillations of a non - equilibrium density profile as a function of the collision rate .",
    "these studies have followed the evolution of the dynamical behaviour of the quantum gas from a collisional ( first sound ) regime to a collisionless ( zero sound ) regime .",
    "however , no direct measurement of the speed of sound propagation has been carried out so far in confined fermi gases , contrary to the case of bose - einstein condensates in elongated traps  @xcite where the propagation of density distortions has been followed experimentally .",

    "because of the absence of thermal dissipation in our model , the density waves continue to travel along the profile and are again reflected at the ends of the trap with a periodicity of about @xmath84ms .",
    "the revivals of smaller amplitude which are seen to occur at about 300ms correspond to the situation in which the perturbation is passing through the centre of the trap . on increasing the coupling strength up to @xmath73 ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , we find that the restoring force due to the other fermionic component plays a role in depressing the intensity of the density waves relative to those seen in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "in summary , we have studied the propagation of collisionless sound waves in a trapped two - component fermi gas , assuming a mean - field model for the repulsive interactions between the two fermionic species and neglecting dissipative collisions as described by a boltzmann quantum collision integral .",
    "the inclusion of such collisions is needed to examine the transition from the zero - sound to the first - sound regime  @xcite , that we expect will be characterized by a marked change in the speed of sound propagation .",
    "we also expect that zero - sound waves will be landau - damped in the case of attractive interactions , as is the case for a homogeneous fermi liquid  @xcite .",
    "we have found that , both at weak coupling and in the strong - coupling regime where the two fermi clouds are demixing from their mutual repulsions , the speed of zero - sound waves is very close to the fermi velocity as determined by the local particle density through the local chemical potential .",
    "these results have been obtained from comparing semi - analytical estimates with numerical studies of the evolution of peaks in the density profiles under driving from an external potential simulating a blue - detuned laser that keeps expelling atoms from the central region of the trap .",
    "we have also examined numerically the time evolution of impulsively created density defects which are characterized by sharp density gradients in a two - component fermi gas with repulsive interactions . in the collisionless regime",
    "we have found that the filling of the vacancy at the trap centre generates density waves which travel to the ends of the trap and are back - reflected there , so that they appear as periodic revivals of distortions in the density profile .",
    "these revivals become attenuated as the strength of the coupling is increased , presumably as a consequence of the increasing efficiency of momentum - redistribution processes through non - dissipative collisions at strong coupling .",
