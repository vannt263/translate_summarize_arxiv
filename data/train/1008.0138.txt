    "bars are the most important type of perturbation found in common among spiral and s0 galaxies . in spiral galaxies where interstellar gas is plentiful",
    ", a bar can be a major engine of gas - dominated secular evolution , leading to radial gas flows , circumnuclear starbursts , and possibly pseudobulges made of disk material ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004=kk04 ) . in s0 galaxies ,",
    "secular evolution is a different issue , because such systems generally have far less interstellar gas than spirals , and thus one must turn to possible interactions between the stellar components , to external interactions , or to the possible relationship between s0s and spirals , for evidence of secular evolution .    of particular interest",
    "is how the properties of bars in s0 galaxies might differ from those in spirals .",
    "bars in early - type spiral galaxies have for some time been reported to be stronger and longer than those in later - type galaxies ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 ) .",
    "however , such an assessment is usually based on contrast : the relative @xmath5=2 fourier intensity amplitude , @xmath6 , is stronger for early - type barred galaxies ( laurikainen et al .",
    "2007 ) , but when the _ forcing _ due to a bar is taken into account , the bars of early - type spirals actually come out weaker than those in later - type spirals ( buta , laurikainen , & salo 2004 ; laurikainen , salo , & buta 2004 ) .",
    "this is because bar strength is a relative parameter that depends on the radial forcing due to the axisymmetric background ( combes & sanders 1981 ) .",
    "the axisymmetric contribution to the potential of early - type galaxies tends to be strong due to the presence of more massive bulges ( laurikainen et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ) .    until recently ,",
    "there has been no detailed study capable of reliably assessing how the distribution of bar strengths in s0 galaxies might differ from those in both early and late - type spirals .",
    "our goal in this paper is to examine this question using data from the near - infrared s0 survey ( nirs0s , laurikainen et al 2005 ; buta et al .",
    "2006 ) , a statistically well - defined @xmath1-band imaging survey of 183 s0 to sa galaxies selected from the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 , de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the nirs0s was carried out from 2004 - 2009 at several major observatories , and some analysis of the data has been presented by laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 , 2007 , 2009 , 2010a ) , focussed mainly on bulge properties of early - type galaxies as opposed to later types .",
    "we wish to examine the implications of the distribution of bar strengths in s0 galaxies as compared to that for spirals , in order to ( 1 ) further explore the possible relationship between the two classes of objects , and ( 2 ) deduce the evolutionary history of bars in the absence of long - term gas flow .",
    "the nirs0s was designed to complement and overlap the _",

    "compared to spirals among bright galaxies , the selection criteria of the nirs0s could not be made identical to those of the osubsgs .",
    "the latter used a magnitude limit of @xmath8 @xmath3 12.0 , while the nirs0s uses a limit of @xmath2 @xmath3 12.5 , where @xmath2 is the weighted mean of the mostly photoelectrically - determined @xmath8 magnitudes in rc3 and photographic magnitudes ( @xmath9 ) on the same scale listed in the same catalogue@xmath312.5 .",
    "the reason for using @xmath2 is that many southern galaxies only have total @xmath10 photoelectric magnitudes in rc3 , but all have @xmath9 , allowing a better definition of the sample . ] .",
    "the osubsgs had no inclination limit , but the nirs0s galaxies were restricted to log@xmath11 @xmath3 0.35 in order to minimize deprojection uncertainties .",
    "this limit nevertheless failed to exclude some edge - on s0s , and even some galaxies just below the limit were found to be too inclined to reliably deproject .",

    "our analysis shows it to be an s0 .",
    "the final sample includes 183 early - type galaxies and is listed in table 1 .",

    "dwarfs are greatly under - represented in both samples and do not form part of our analysis ( see , e. g. , marinova & jogee 2007 ) .",
    "we measure bar strengths from the maximum tangential forcing relative to the mean background radial forcing ( combes & sanders 1981 ) using a polar grid method ( salo et al . 1999 ; laurikainen & salo 2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "a deprojected near - infrared image is converted to a gravitational potential assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio , and from this potential the maximum ratio of the tangential to mean radial force , @xmath15 , is derived as a function of radius @xmath16 ( an example is shown in figure 4 of buta et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the maximum of this function is called @xmath17 , which is equivalent to the maximum gravitational torque per unit mass per unit square of the circular speed .",
    "we use the polar grid approach ( as opposed to the cartesian method used by quillen , frogel , & gonzalez 1994 ) because it is less sensitive to noise and provides more stable values of @xmath15 versus @xmath16 . for the whole nirs0s sample",

    ". a more important problem could be the contribution of dark matter to the axisymmetric background potential .",
    "we showed in buta , laurikainen , & salo ( 2004 ) that corrections to @xmath17 for dark matter , based on a  universal rotation curve \" ( persic , salucci , & stel 1996 ) , are relatively small for the high luminosity osubsgs spirals . in the case of s0s ,",

    ", @xmath17 includes contributions from both the bar and the spiral .",
    "therefore , for osubsgs spirals we also use bar strengths in which the spiral contribution is eliminated using the fourier - based method of buta , block , & knapen ( 2003 ) , which leads to individual estimates of the bar strength , @xmath18 , and the spiral strength , @xmath19 . in s0 galaxies ,",
    "spiral structure is absent , @xmath20 , and the two parameters can be used interchangeably .",
    "this is also not a bad approximation even for spirals .",
    "for example , figure 5 of buta 2004 shows a separation for the sb0/a galaxy ngc 4596 where the arms are too weak to make @xmath18 different from @xmath17 .",
    "also , figure 26 of buta et al .",

    "an important parameter in bar strength studies is the vertical scale height , @xmath21 , a quantity which can only be reliably measured in edge - on galaxies , and which impacts the forcing in the plane used for estimating bar strengths . in our previous analyses of osubsgs spiral galaxies",
    ", we assumed an exponential vertical density distribution and derived @xmath21 as a type - dependent fraction of the radial scale length @xmath22 , based on a study by de grijs ( 1998 ) . for types sa and earlier , sab to sbc , and sc and",

    "values as low as @xmath26 or @xmath27 are also possible for s0s from de grijs s analysis .",
    "the vertical scale height is the largest source of uncertainty in the gravitational torque method ( see laurikainen & salo 2002 ) . because of this",
    ", we also consider a different approach ( speltincx et al .",
    "2008 ) : instead of scaling @xmath21 from the radial scale length , we scale it from the @xmath28 = 20.0 mag arcsec@xmath29 isophotal radius , @xmath30 , based on _ two - micron all - sky survey _ ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al . 1997 ) surface photometry provided on the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) website .",
    "we use scalings @xmath31 = 0.05 , 0.10 , and 0.20 , and examine the full impact of @xmath21 assumptions on the distribution of early - type galaxy bar strengths .",
    "of the 183 nirs0s galaxies listed in table 1 , 174 were observed in our program ( the objects not observed are indicated in table 1 . ) of those observed , 35 had to be rejected from our statistical analysis of bar strengths in early - type galaxies either because they were too inclined in spite of what their catalogued isophotal axis ratio implied , were interacting or peculiar , or were members of close pairs where the two components were difficult to separate .",
    "nearby dwarfs such as ngc 205 and ngc 5206 were also rejected . of these , only ngc 5206 was actually observed .",

    "our final sample for the bar strength analysis consists of 138 galaxies .",

    "this turns out to be in good agreement with other ways of evaluating bar strength .",
    "for example , laurikainen et al . (",
    "2009 ) compared fractions of bars , ovals , and lenses ( in the near - ir ) in galaxies of different types , and found that s0 galaxies have a smaller fraction of bars than s0/a galaxies or later spirals .",
    "aguerri et al .",
    "( 2009 ) used isophotal ellipse fits ( in the optical ) to come to the same conclusion .",
    "our goal in this section is to examine several possible reasons for why the distributions of bar strengths in spirals and s0s are so different . in particular , we are interested in how the distributions connect to the possibility that spirals are the progenitors of s0s , an idea which originally came from comparison of the frequencies of s0s in clusters and in the field ( dressler 1980 ) .      one way to interpret a distribution of bar strengths was discussed by bournaud & combes ( 2002 ) , who used simulations to investigate the possibility that a galaxy may have multiple bar episodes during a hubble time .",
    "if bar strength is a parameter that varies over time , then the relative frequency of galaxies in each bin must tell us the relative amount of time a galaxy spends in a given bar state ( non - barred , weakly - barred , or strongly - barred ) .",
    "the bar state is something that could evolve due to gas accretion from external sources .",
    "bars first grow , perhaps by swing amplification ( combes 2000 ) or by transferring angular momentum to a halo ( athanassoula 2003 ) , and then drive gas into the center , building up a central mass concentration .",
    "this helps to heat the disk and weakens or destroys the bar .",
    "if there is gas accretion , the disk can be cooled to the point of instability to a new bar , as shown by bournaud & combes ( 2002 ) .",
    "according to block et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , gas accretion produces an extended  tail \" to the distribution of bar strengths , while lack of gas accretion leads to a higher relative frequency of axisymmetric states than does gas accretion .",
    "the distribution of bar strengths in s0 galaxies , within the bournaud & combes framework , seems to support the idea that these galaxies have not accreted any external gas for a long time , while spirals have accreted gas .",
    "however , it remains to be determined in this framework what systematic environmental differences result in differences in gas accretion efficiency .",
    "s0s may in general have only a small amount of cool gas , but this does not explain why s0s have not accreted more gas .",
    "s0 galaxies may not be directly comparable to the non - accreting models of bournaud & combes , which still have interstellar gas and spiral structure .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that s0s have weaker bars on average because they have more massive bulges than spirals ( laurikainen et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ) .",
    "this dilutes the tangential forces , making even a relatively strong - looking ( high relative @xmath5=2 fourier amplitude or high maximum ellipticity ) bar come out weak ( see figures 8 and 10 of laurikainen , salo , & buta 2004 for illustrations of this dilution effect between early- and late - type spirals ) . as a check of how much this effect plays a role",
    ", we analyzed the sb0 galaxy ngc 7155 from buta et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , using similar techniques as for formal nirs0s galaxies .",
    "the bar strength is derived from a deprojected image obtained by first subtracting a spherical bulge model , deprojecting the disk component structures , and then adding back the bulge .",
    "the bar strength obtained for this galaxy using such an image is 0.19 . according to figure 1 of laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , an sbc galaxy has about half the @xmath1-band bulge - to - total luminosity ratio as a typical s0 . in order to simulate this",
    ", we add back to ngc 7155 s disk component the same bulge model scaled down by a factor.of 2 . this yielded a bar strength of 0.26 , 37% larger than for the actual bulge model .",
    "since the strongest rc3 s0 bars have @xmath17 @xmath3 0.3 , this kind of effect would translate to a spiral maximum equivalent @xmath17 @xmath3 0.4 , while the actual spiral @xmath17 can be as high as 0.7 ( e.g. , laurikainen et al . 2004 ; buta et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "de grijs ( 1998 ) showed that on average , s0s have thicker disks than late - type spirals .",
    "for a given mass , this implies less tangential forcing in the plane .",
    "the effect of the disk thickness on @xmath17 was estimated by laurikainen & salo ( 2002 ) : calculating two extreme cases for the sbab galaxy ngc 1433 , @xmath21=@xmath45 and 10 , changes @xmath17 from 0.4 to 0.5",
    ".    the combination of more massive bulges and thicker disks can therefore account for some of the difference in average bar strength between s0s and spirals .",
    "however , it is not likely to account for all of the difference because other methods of estimating bar strength also indicate that s0 bars are weaker on average than bars in spirals .",
    "aguerri et al .",
    "( 2009 ) used the ellipticity - based @xmath46 parameter of abraham & merrifield ( 2000 ) to show , for an sdss volume - limited sample , that s0 bars have a lower median @xmath46 than early- or late - type spirals .",
    "aguerri et al .",
    "( 2009 ) tested the impact of the bulge on bar ellipticities , and concluded it had no affect on their result that s0 bars are weaker than spiral bars .",
    "one of the main conclusions of laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2010a ) is that the specific photometric properties of s0 bulges and disks ( e.g. , srsic @xmath47 , correlation of bulge and disk scale lengths ) favor the idea that s0s in general are evolved from spiral progenitors ( see also dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; bekki et al .",
    "2002 ; shioya et al . 2004 ; van den bergh 2009 ; and also burstein et al .",
    "2005 for a counter - argument ) .",
    "the main problem with this interpretation is that s0 bulges are more massive than spiral bulges , yet the present interstellar gas content of spirals is insufficient to account for such masses ( kk04 ) .",
    "this could simply mean that s0s had more gas - rich progenitors than present - day spirals , or that another mechanism , unrelated to gas flow , could have caused pre - existing disk stars to become part of a pseudobulge .",
    "for the latter , kk04 suggested that a bar buckling instability might be relevant , although this mechanism mostly raises the stars away from the disk plane , but does not necessarily lead to the radial migration of the stars which is needed to build up the kind of central mass that would significantly dilute @xmath17 .",
    "the concept of the bulge in the buckling process is different from the kind of bulge we are concerned with .",
    "a bulge created by buckling is actually part of the bar , as discussed in many simulation studies ( e.g. , see review by merrifield 1995 ) .",
    "if s0s are mainly spirals that have been stripped of ( or used up , or lost ) all or most of their gas , then they should evolve as purely stellar systems .",
    "block et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have noted : `` in the absence of gas , the dynamics of disks is different : pure stellar bars are very robust , and can endure for one hubble time , contrary to bars in spirals . in s0s , bars are not destroyed , and no mechanism is needed to explain bar reformation . ''",
    "this suggests that once the gas is gone , no further evolution of the bar would be possible and the galaxy would maintain the bar strength it had after the gas was removed .",
    "thus , whatever bar is left is not destroyed any further , and s0 galaxies would be preserving a type of  fossil \" bar .",
    "the more massive bulges in s0s nevertheless suggest , either that s0s are not stripped spirals , or that secular evolution does occur in s0s , including bar evolution .",
    "these bulges , which make s0 bars systematically weaker compared to spirals , could be explained if there existed an effective mechanism which allows the bulge to continue to grow from disk material during , or even after , the gas depletion process .",
    "one such mechanism , the potential - density phase shift ( pdps ) mechanism , was proposed by zhang ( 1996 , 1998 , 1999 ) . according to the pdps mechanism , inward movement of the _ stellar",
    "_ component could still occur as long as the bar wave mode has a small amount of skewness ( i.e. , can be thought of as a very open spiral ) . just like a spiral ,",
    "bar skewness would introduce a phase shift between the density and potential of the bar , causing stellar material ( as well as gas ) to slowly move inward inside corotation and outward outside corotation , with the result of slow secular mass increase in the bulge and a spreading outward of the disk .",
    "a by - product of the radial mass redistribution induced by the pdps mechanism is the secular heating of the disk stars in all three spatial dimensions , which also leads to the growth of the bulge ( zhang 1999 ) .",
    "zhang & buta ( 2007 ; their figure 7 especially ) show that slightly skewed bars are indeed present among early - type barred galaxies , making the pdps mechanism a viable process to consider .",
    "the mechanism can operate in any galaxy with a skewed pattern , and is purely gravitational , so it affects both stars and gas .",
    "the mechanism is not expected to be important if a bar is perfectly linear or a spiral is very tightly wound ( zhang 2008 ) .",
    "note that the ability of the mechanism to account for the more massive bulges in s0s does not depend on the exact process that depletes the gas in a galaxy .",
    "evolution from a later type system ( small @xmath48 ratio ) to an earlier type system ( larger @xmath48 ratio ) follows naturally from the process .",
    "if only star formation depletes the gas , then the transition from spiral to s0 could be smooth and the bulges of s0s could then simply be more advanced in an evolutionary sense than those in spirals ( zhang 1999 ) .",
    "if another mechanism , such as ram pressure stripping , depletes the gas , the pdps mechanism could still operate , but the resulting s0 may not have as large a @xmath48 mass ratio as it would have had if star formation depleted the gas .",
    "studies of the role of a central mass concentration ( cmc ) in weakening or destroying bars have suggested that a mere buildup of bulge mass would be insufficient for total bar destruction .",
    "shen & sellwood ( 2004 ) used numerical simulations to show that diffuse cmcs are much less effective at destroying bars than extremely dense cmcs .",
    "in fact , their simulations did not even use a bulge model , only a disk plus a cmc .",
    "if an s0 did develop a massive enough ( few percent disk mass ) and concentrated enough ( supermassive black hole ( smbh)-like ) cmc , then its bar could be destroyed in a hubble time .",
    "athanassoula , lambert , & dehnen ( 2005 ; see also references therein ) showed that a cmc with 10% of the mass of the disk could severely weaken a bar over time even in the presence of a significant halo .",
    "evidence that bars can be destroyed or weakened in s0s may come from the existence of lenses .",
    "kormendy ( 1979 ) showed that lenses ( components of galaxy structure having a shallow brightness gradient interior to a sharp outer edge ) are most abundant in sb0-sba galaxies and much less abundant in later - type barred galaxies , the latter having mostly inner rings .",

    "( 2009 ) found lenses in 97% of a subset of 127 nirs0s galaxies ; in that study also , s0/a galaxies included 82% with lenses .",
    "kormendy ( 1979 ) suggested that lenses are the products of dissolved or dissolving bars , an idea supported by an observational study of the lens in the s0@xmath12 galaxy ngc 1553 ( kormendy 1984 ) and by numerical simulations such as those of bournaud & combes ( 2002 ) .",
    "numerical simulations by heller et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have also shown that bars can evolve to  fat ovals \" over time .",
    "if this is indeed a viable origin for lenses , then even if s0s were tied mainly to s0/a progenitors , the lower relative frequency of lenses in s0/a types compared to s0s suggests that bars do not  freeze \" after a galaxy is stripped , but continue to evolve towards further dissolution .",
    "laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have suggested that the frequent presence of lenses in s0s , of ansae in the bars of many s0s ( laurikainen et al . 2007 ; martinez - valpuesta et al .",
    "2007 ) , and of the double - peaked fourier profiles in early - type galaxies ( laurikainen et al . 2007 ) , argues that the bars of s0s are simply more evolved than those in spirals .",
    "if s0s have spiral progenitors that did not necessarily have lenses at the time the galaxies were stripped or cleaned of gas , then the formation of some lenses had to have occurred _ during _ the s0 phase , meaning bar evolution must have continued in the absence of much interstellar gas .",
    "a caveat connected with the lens issue is that not all lenses are likely to be associated with dissolved bars . in galaxies with multiple lenses",
    ", some could represent highly evolved former zones of active star formation , such as inner , outer , and nuclear rings , in addition to highly evolved bars .",
    "we have highlighted the significant difference in the distribution of bar strengths between s0 and spiral galaxies .",
    "strong bars having @xmath18 @xmath39 0.25 are rare among s0s but relatively common among spirals . much of the difference can be traced to the more massive bulges and thicker disks on average that characterize s0s as compared to spirals , both of which conspire to make s0 maximum relative gravitational bar torques low compared to spirals .",
    "this can not be the whole reason behind the difference , however , because even when relative bar fourier contrast , bar ellipticity , and bar fraction are considered , bars are still less prominent in s0s than in spirals .",
    "the suggestion is that if spirals really are the progenitors of s0s , then there must exist a mechanism that allows bar evolution to continue after gas depletion .",
    "one possible mechanism , tied to the skewness of early - type galaxy bars , is a potential - density phase shift that can evolve the purely stellar distibution , allowing continued bulge - building that will help to weaken any bar remaining after gas depletion .",
    "the earlier findings of the high frequency of lenses in s0s fits to the scenario in which bar evolution continues after depletion .",
