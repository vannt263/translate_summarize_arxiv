    ", the equality @xmath1 for the pressures becomes the statement @xmath2 in terms of the metric components , this leads to an ordinary differential equation [ ode ] , which then constrains the spacetime geometry , for _ any _ perfect fluid sphere .    over the last 90 years , many `` ad hoc '' approaches to solving this differential equation",
    "have been explored , often by picking special coordinate systems , or making simple ansatze for one or other of the metric components  @xcite .",
    "( for recent overviews see @xcite . )",
    "the big change over the last several years has been the introduction of  algorithmic \" techniques that permit one to generate large classes perfect fluid spheres in a purely mechanical way  @xcite . in this article",
    "we will extend these algorithmic ideas , by proving several solution - generating theorems of varying levels of complexity .",
    "we shall then explore the formal properties of these solution - generating theorems ( which generalize the notion of the buchdahl transformation ) and then will use these theorems to classify some of the previously known exact solutions , and additionally will generate several new previously unknown perfect fluid solutions .",

    "this equation ( [ ode_for_b ] ) is a first - order linear non - homogeneous equation in @xmath8 .",

    "the question we are going to answer in this section is , how to systematically `` deform '' the geometry ( [ line_element_1 ] ) while still retaining the perfect fluid property . that is ,",
    "suppose we start with the specific geometry defined by @xmath11 and assume it represents a perfect fluid sphere .",
    "we will show how to `` deform '' this solution by applying five different transformation theorems on @xmath12 , such that the outcome still presents a perfect fluid sphere .",
    "the outcome of this process will depend on one or more free parameters , and so automatically generates an entire family of perfect fluid spheres of which the original starting point is only one member . in addition , we analyze what happens if you apply these theorems more than once , iterating them in various ways .",
    "the first theorem we present is a variant of a result first explicitly published in @xcite , though another limited variant of this result can also be found in  @xcite .",
    "we first re - phrase the theorem of @xcite in slightly different formalism , and demonstrate an independent way of proving it . using our proof it is easy to show that by applying theorem 1 more than once no further solutions will be obtained , therefore the transformation in theorem 1 is , ( in a certain sense to be made precise below ) , `` idempotent '' .",

    "for some purposes it is more useful to rephrase theorem 2 as below :    let @xmath87 and @xmath88 both represent perfect fluid spheres , then for all @xmath42 and @xmath89 @xmath90 is also a perfect fluid sphere .",
    "furthermore , for fixed @xmath91 all perfect fluid spheres can be written in this form .",

    "similarly , corollary 2 applied to a combination of the einstein static universe and anti - de sitter space is another way of obtaining schwarzschild s stellar solution .",
    "having now found the first and second generating theorems makes it useful to define two new theorems by composing them .",
    "take a perfect fluid sphere solution @xmath93 .",
    "applying theorem 1 onto it gives us a new perfect fluid sphere @xmath94 .",

    "if we now continue by applying theorem 2 , again we get a new solution @xmath96 , where @xmath97 now depends on the new @xmath95 . all together",
    "we can consider this as a single process , by introducing the following theorem : +    if @xmath39 denotes a perfect fluid sphere , then for all @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath15 , the three - parameter geometry defined by @xmath98 is also a perfect fluid sphere , where @xmath99 is @xmath100 that is @xmath101    now , instead of starting with theorem 1 we could first apply theorem 2 on @xmath93 .",
    "this gives us a new perfect fluid sphere @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is given by equation ( [ eq_for_zeta_1 ] ) .",
    "continuing with theorem 1 leads to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 depends on the new @xmath106 .",

    "furthermore theorem 3 and theorem 4 are in general not idempotent @xmath113 the best way to verify this is to try a few specific examples",
    ". there may be some specific and isolated special metrics for which theorem 3 and theorem 4 happen to be degenerate , or idempotent , and finding such metrics is important for our classification programme .",
    "the solution generating theorems we have developed interact in a number of interesting ways and exhibit numerous formal properties that will be useful when classifying generic perfect fluid spheres . to start with , theorem 3 @xmath114 and theorem 4 @xmath115 can be expressed in terms of theorem 1 @xmath116 and theorem 2 @xmath117 : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a metric representing a perfect fluid sphere . having this in mind , some of the new solutions generated by starting from some specific solution can be identified .",
    "for example : @xmath120 or @xmath121 the idempotence of @xmath19 and @xmath51 in this formalism is : @xmath122 taken together , it is possible to simplify all formulae wherever @xmath19 and @xmath51 appear next to each other more than once .",
    "the following examples should demonstrate how this works : @xmath123 and in the same way @xmath124 these relationships can be used to structure the solution set generated starting from any particular perfect fluid sphere , and moreover to classify which metrics can be produced by our theorems , and ones which can not .",
    "for example , the idempotence property of theorem 1 and theorem 2 enables us to divide the class of perfect fluid spheres into seed metrics and non - seed metrics .",
    "seed metrics can never be generated by using one of the two theorems @xmath19 or @xmath51 , while non - seed metrics are connected to other simpler metrics via one of these theorems .",
    "we formalize this in the following subsection .",
    "* definition ( seed metric ) : * take a metric @xmath119 ( or a parameterized class of metrics ) and apply theorem 1 or theorem 2 on it .",
    "three different cases are possible :    * each of the applications supplies us with a new solution . [ @xmath125 . ]",
    "we define a metric with this behaviour as a seed metric .",
    "( we shall soon see several examples of this behaviour . ) * only one of the applications supplies us with a new solution , while the other one gives us the same metric we started with .",
    "[ @xmath126 or @xmath127 . ]",
    "these metrics are non - seed metrics .",
    "( we shall soon see several examples of this behaviour . ) * both applications give us the same metric we started with .",
    "[ @xmath128 . ]",
    "metrics of this type are fixed points of the transformation process and we then also have @xmath129 .",
    "while we have encountered numerical examples that seem to exhibit this fixed point behaviour , we have no analytic proof for the existence of non - obvious fixed - point metrics .",
    "there is one obvious but not particularly useful example of a fixed point class of metrics . if we take the ode in equation ( [ ode_for_b ] ) , and write down its most general solution as a functional of the arbitrary parameters @xmath9 , then any of our solution generating theorems applied to this most general solution will at most move us around in the parameter space characterizing the most general solution",
    " the most general solution of equation ( [ ode_for_b ] ) , or equivalently equation ( [ ode_for_zeta ] ) , is thus an infinite - parameter fixed point of the generating theorems .",
    "but apart from this obvious example , it is unclear whether other fixed point classes of metric exist .",
    "+ we can nevertheless develop several formal lemmata regarding fixed - point metrics .",
    "for instance    suppose we have a metric such that @xmath130 , @xmath47 , @xmath15 @xmath131 where we recall that @xmath38 denotes equality up to redefinition of parameters .",
    "then in particular @xmath132 and so @xmath133    conversely , suppose we have a metric such that @xmath134 then @xmath132 and so @xmath135    trivial , note that @xmath136 and @xmath137",
    ". then recall @xmath138 .",
    "similarly for the converse .",
    "suppose we have a metric @xmath119 such that @xmath139 and then define @xmath140 by @xmath141 then we have @xmath142 so that @xmath140 is a `` fixed point '' of both @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "note @xmath145 and similarly for @xmath143 : @xmath146    several other formal theorems along these lines can be constructed , but these seem the most important results .    finally , among the formal properties enjoyed by the generating theorems , we mention the fact that theorems 3 and 4 are `` conjugate '' to each other in the following sense @xmath147^{-1 } =   { \\textsf{t}_\\textsf{1}}\\circ{\\textsf{t}_\\textsf{3 } } \\circ [ { \\textsf{t}_\\textsf{1}}]^{-1},\\ ] ] and similarly ( when the appropriate inverse @xmath148^{-1}$ ] exists ) @xmath149^{-1 } =   { \\textsf{t}_\\textsf{2}}\\circ{\\textsf{t}_\\textsf{4 } } \\circ [ { \\textsf{t}_\\textsf{2}}]^{-1}.\\ ] ] we can write this as @xmath150 where @xmath151 denotes the concept of `` similarity '' under conjugation by invertible generating theorems .",
    "we wish to emphasise that similarity @xmath151 is a statement that holds for particular and fixed values of the parameters @xmath152 , as opposed to @xmath38 which denotes equivalence under redefinition of parameters .",
    "if one is working numerically , it is much easier to ask questions involving similarity @xmath151 . for analytic work , it is typically easier to ask questions involving equivalence @xmath38 .",
    "the last two solution generating theorems we shall present are slightly different from those developed so far : consider a perfect fluid sphere solution @xmath153 and extend it to a new perfect fluid sphere @xmath154 .",
    "previously , we had either set @xmath155 and obtained theorem 1 , or we had set @xmath156 and obtained theorem 2 .",
    "in other words , we only changed one metric component at a time .",
    "( from this point of view theorem 3 and theorem 4 are , strictly speaking , not new theorems , in that they are replaceable by iterations of theorem 1 and theorem 2 and vice versa . )",
    "we now investigate what happens if we place no _ a priori _ restrictions on @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and allow both metric components to vary simultaneously .",
    "the differential equation ( [ ode_for_b ] ) for this problem now becomes @xmath159 \\delta ' + \\left [ 2 r^2 ( \\zeta_{0 } z_{0 } ) '' - 2 ( r \\zeta_{0 } z_{0 } ) ' \\right ] \\delta + \\left [ r^2 \\zeta_0   b_0 ' + 4 r^2 \\zeta_0 ' b_0 - 2 r \\zeta_0 b_0\\right ] z_0 ' + 2 r^2 \\zeta_0 b_0 z_0 ''   = 0.\\ ] ] note that if @xmath156 this becomes equation ( [ ode_th1 ] ) , while if @xmath160 this becomes equation ( [ ode_th2 ] ) .",

    "this ode can be solved explicitly and the result stated as a new theorem :    suppose @xmath161 describes a perfect fluid sphere , and let @xmath162 be arbitrary .",

    "there is however a related theorem ( which may be easier to understand ) in terms of parametric derivatives :    let @xmath169 denote a one - parameter class of perfect fluid spheres , so that the differential equation ( [ ode_for_b ] ) is satisfied for all @xmath170 .",

    "in contrast for non - seed metrics one or the other of these theorems is trivial , either @xmath126 or @xmath127 .    by considering the idempotence of theorem 1 and theorem 2 , and",
    "the fact that theorem 3 and theorem 4 can be expressed in terms of the first two theorems , it is possible to structure , and therefore to graphically visualize the relationship between all metrics generated from a given seed metric .",
    "we demonstrate this behaviour starting with minkowski spacetime as seed metric , checking if it is possible to create endless new perfect fluid spheres starting with this trivial seed .",
    "the first few steps can be carried out explicitly , and show that minkowski space generates several well known interesting perfect fluid models .    in figure [ structure_graph1 ]",
    "all the ideas from the previous sections are used .",
    "each box represents a specific metric ( perfect fluid sphere ) while the arrows correspond to the application of the different theorems .",
    "the horizontal arrows correspond to an application of theorem 1 and the vertical arrows to an application of theorem 2 .",
    "in addition , the vectors pointing along the diagonals can either indicate an application of theorem 3 or theorem 4 .",
    "a dotted arrow corresponds to the application of theorem 3 while the dashed arrow represents an application of theorem 4 .",
    "[ structure ]    figure [ structure_graph1 ] shows that after applying theorem 1 to the minkowski seed metric , we get the einstein static universe . by the idempotence of theorem 1 , @xmath81 applications of @xmath19 to the seed metric still results in the einstein static .",
    "similary , any number of applications of theorem 2 after the first ( which leads to the k  o iii solution ) does not give us any further new solutions ( see figure [ idempotence_theorem2 ] ) .",
    "we can also see that the first and second generating theorems are not commutative .",
    "application of theorem 1 and theorem 2 in that order to the minkowski seed metric results in the schwarzchild interior geometry , whereas application of theorem 1 after theorem 2 gives us the martin 3 solution , and the three - parameter schwarzschild interior solution is quite distinct from the three - parameter martin 3 solution .",
    "indeed , it seems as if it is possible to create endless new solutions for a perfect fluid sphere out of the minkwoski metric ( or any other of the seed metrics ) .",
    "after several iterations the calculations become more complex , and can no longer be carried out analytically .",
    "we then resort to numeric computation to find out whether theorem 3 and theorem 4 have some sort of numerical limit , a numerical fixed point , or not .",
    "depending on the choices made for the parameters @xmath215 both theorems converge very quickly . specifically , we used matlab to numerically analyze the evolution of @xmath9 and @xmath8 after applying theorem 3 several times to the minkowski metric .",
    "numerical results are summarized in figure [ structure_graph2 ] .",
    "this figure indicates that theorem 3 and theorem 4 both appear to have well defined numerical limits , though we have no direct analytic solution for the fixed point metric .",
    "using schwarzschild coordinates we have developed several transformation theorems that map perfect fluid spheres into perfect fluid spheres , and have used these transformations as a basis for classifying different types of perfect fluid sphere solutions . if we apply these theorems on a known perfect fluid sphere , different solutions are often obtained . while some of the solutions are already known in the literature , most of them are novel .",
    "therefore , we have developed a tool to generate new solutions for a perfect fluid sphere , which does not require us to directly solve the einstein equations .",
    "( of course the whole procedure was set up in such a way that we are implicitly and indirectly solving the einstein equations , but the utility of the transformation theorems is that one does not have to go back to first principles for each new calculation . )    in addition , we have also established several relationships among the generating theorems .",
    "previously , all metrics seemed to have nothing more in common than representing a perfect fluid sphere .",
    "we have developed the concept of a seed metric , which is one that can not be generated by our theorems .",
    "starting with a seed metric and applying our theorems , it is possible to structure , therefore to visualize , the relationship between all metrics generated from a given seed metric in a graph .",
    "based on this example it is possible to create endless new solutions out of the minkowski metric .",
    "we also used a numeric program to investigate whether theorem 3 and theorem 4 have fixed point limits . both seem to converge very quickly .    in summary ,",
    "the class of static perfect fluid sphere solutions to the einstein equations exhibits a deep and somewhat unexpected structure  the transformation theorems of this article provide a new and distinct way of looking at the problem , and yield a new way of viewing the inter - relationships between different static fluid spheres .",
