    "its proximity makes it a prime target for future extrasolar planet direct imaging efforts .",
    "the success of these efforts will depend on knowing exactly where to look , requiring accurate orbital elements for the companion .",
    "it will depend on the mass of the planetary companion , and will depend on the age of the system .",
    "younger and more massive gas giant planets are predicted to be brighter ( hubbard 2002 ) .",
    "if young enough , the intrinsic luminosity of @xmath0  eri  b might be greater than its brightness in reflected light",
    ". however , planetary mass objects with the age of @xmath0  eri   change intrinsic luminosity by a factor of nearly 100 between 1 @xmath8 and 7 @xmath8 . hence the need for a more precise companion mass .",
    "@xmath0  eri  has been the subject of multiple radial velocity ( rv ) planet searches .",
    "walker ( 1995 ) , using measurements spanning 11 years , found evidence for @xmath9 10 yr variation with an amplitude of 15 m s@xmath10  .",
    "these results were substantiated by nelson & angel ( 1998 ) using an analysis of the same data set . cumming ( 1999 ) analyzed 11 years of rv data on this star taken at lick observatory and found significant variations with comparable amplitude but with a shorter period of 6.9 years .",
    "because of the high level of magnetic activity for @xmath0  eri ( inferred from chromospheric activity ) , these rv variations were largely interpreted as arising from a stellar activity cycle .",
    "the mcdonald observatory planet search program ( cochran & hatzes 1999 ) has monitored @xmath0  eri since late 1988 .",
    "the mcdonald results in combination with these other surveys , along with data from eso ( endl 2002 ) , confirmed the presence of long period rv variations and demonstrated that the most likely explanation for the observed rv variations was the presence of a planetary companion with a period , p = 6.9 y. details of this analysis are given in hatzes ( 2000 ) .",
    "we obtained three years of astrometry with _ hst _ with millisecond of arc precision which we combined with radial velocity data as we have in previous planetary mass studies @xcite .",
    "just as in the case of the hatzes ( 2000 ) radial velocity analysis , where less - precise data extended the observation span and allowed a companion detection , we anticipated that less - precise astrometry with a 14 year baseline from the allegheny multichannel astrometric photometer ( map ) astrometry project would improve the astrometric result .",
    "gatewood ( 2000 ) reported in a meeting abstract an inclination , i = 46@xmath1 17  and a companion mass @xmath11 obtained with the map data alone . in this study",
    "we combine the map data with the _",
    "hst  _ data , only to improve the determination of the proper motion of @xmath0  eri .",
    "the parallax and proper motion must be removed as accurately as possible to determine the perturbation orbit of @xmath0  eri , which , when combined with an estimate of the mass of @xmath0  eri , will provide the mass of the companion , @xmath0  eri  b.    this paper presents a mass of the planet orbiting @xmath0  eri   discussed in hatzes ( 2000 ) , not the far longer period object inferred from dust - disk morphology @xcite .",
    "our mass is derived from combined astrometric and radial velocity data , continuing a series presenting accurate masses of planetary companions to nearby stars .",
    "previous results include the mass of gl 876b @xcite and of @xmath12 cancri d @xcite .    in section 2 we briefly review the astrometers and discuss the data sets coming from each , and identify our many sources for radial velocities . in section 3 we present the results of extensive spectrophotometry of the astrometric reference stars , information required to correct relative parallax to absolute . in section 4",
    "we briefly discuss our astrometric modeling and the quality of our results as determined by residuals . in section 5",
    "we review our radial velocity data . in section 6",
    "we derive an absolute parallax and relative proper motion for @xmath0  eri , those nuisance parameters that must be removed to determine the perturbation orbital parameters .",
    "we finally establish the perturbation orbital parameters and , combined with an estimate of the mass of @xmath0  eri , estimate a mass for @xmath0  eri   b. we discuss system age , dust , and companion detectability in section 7 , and summarize our conclusions in section 8 .",

    "each time is that of the first observation within each epoch .",
    "each distinct observation set typically contains five measurements of @xmath0  eri .",
    "the field was observed at multiple spacecraft roll values , and @xmath0  eri  had to be placed in different , non - central locations within the fgs1r fov to accommodate the less than optimal distribution of reference stars .",
    "fgs photometric sensitivity depends on location within the fov ( _ e.g. _ benedict 1998 ) and depends on time , as the fgs pmt age .",
    "given the faintness of our reference stars , we could not use them to provide a high - precision flat field .",

    "_ benedict 2000a ) to monitor @xmath0  eri   stellar activity .",
    "the multichannel astrometric photometer ( map ) and associated observation and reduction procedures are described by gatewood ( 1987 ) . the observational program utilizing the map began in 1986 , but reluctance to observe at the low @xmath0  eri   declination over the city of pittsburgh delayed initiation of its observation until january of 1989 . despite the reduced precision and rate of successful observation",
    ", the field remained on the map program until the installation of new instrumentation early in 2004 ( gatewood 2004 ) .",
    "map observations of the brightest stars utilize either a specially filtered 12th channel ( e.g. gatewood & han 2006 ) or a divide by 16 feature on channel 2 , which reduces the count sufficiently for the 16 bit counters . with an r magnitude of 3.0 @xmath0  eri",
    "could be placed on channel 2 without counter flooding .",

    "an observation consists of 4 x 11 minute sweeps of the ruling across the field with probe rotations and ruling rotations to reduce systematic error ( gatewood 1987 ) .",

    "any prior knowledge concerning the fifteen stars included in our reference frame eventually enters our modeling as observations with error , and yields the most accurate parallax and proper motion for the prime target , @xmath0  eri .",
    "these periodic and non- periodic motions must be removed as accurately and precisely as possible to obtain the perturbation inclination and size caused by @xmath0  eri  b.      figure [ fig-1 ] shows the distribution of the ten reference stars in the 130 map @xmath0  eri  observation sets ( table  [ tbl - loom ] ) .",

    "the derived absolute magnitudes are critically dependent on the assumed stellar luminosity , a parameter impossible to obtain for all but the latest type stars using only figure [ fig-3 ] . to confirm the luminosity classes we obtain ucac2 proper motions @xcite for a one - degree - square field centered on @xmath0  eri , and then iteratively employ the technique of reduced proper motion @xcite to discriminate between giants and dwarfs .",

    "contributions to the error are a small but undetermined @xmath17 and errors in @xmath15 due to uncertainties in color to spectral type mapping .",
    "we estimate a spectral type for reference star ref-6 only through its apparent magnitude , hence , the larger error in its distance modulus .",
    "ref-2 , which in figure  [ fig-3 ] straddles the gap between giants and dwarfs , was finally typed k4v , because the @xmath25 ( from modeling of the reference frame ) significantly decreased , using that typing .",
    "its input parallax error was also increased .",
    "all reference star absolute parallax estimates are listed in table [ tbl - spp ] .",
    "individually , no reference star absolute parallax is better determined than @xmath26 = 18% .",

    "the @xmath0  eri   reference frame contains fifteen stars and has been measured by two different astrometers , fgs1r and map .",
    "the only object in common is @xmath0  eri . from these positional measurements we determine the scale , rotation , and offset  plate constants \" relative to an arbitrarily adopted constraint epoch for each observation set . as for all our previous astrometric analyses , we employ gaussfit ( jefferys 1988 ) to minimize @xmath25 .",
    "the solved equations of condition for the @xmath0  eri   field are : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34    for fgs1r data and @xmath35 @xmath36 for the map data .",

    "we obtain the parallax factors from a jpl earth orbit predictor ( standish 1990 ) , upgraded to version de405 .",
    "orientation to the sky for the fgs1r data is obtained from ground - based astrometry ( 2mass catalog ) with uncertainties of @xmath55 .",
    "histograms of the map residuals ( figure  [ fig - maph ] ) indicate per - observation precision of @xmath67 mas .",
    "because we are seeking the signature of a perturbation over three times smaller than that per - observation precision , the map data were only used to lower the errors on parallax and proper motion , not to establish any perturbation parameters . as for the fgs data , the optical field angle distortion calibration @xcite reduces as - built _ hst _ telescope and fgs1r distortions with magnitude @xmath56 to below 2 mas over much of the fgs1r field of regard . from histograms of the fgs astrometric residuals ( figure  [ fig - fgsh ] )",
    "we conclude that we have obtained correction at the @xmath57 mas level .",
    "the reference frame catalogs for map and fgs1r in @xmath58 and @xmath59 standard coordinates ( table [ tbl - pos ] ) were determined with @xmath60 and @xmath61 mas ( map ) , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 mas ( fgs ) .",
    "measurements from four planet search groups were included in our modeling .",
    "table  [ tbl - rv ] lists the source , coverage , technique , number of observations and the rms deviation from the final orbit of these observations .",
    "the weighting of the rv data was carefully evaluated with independent modeling and significant outliers were filtered .",
    "for example - if five data points were taken in succession , all assigned with the same weight and one point was 50 m s@xmath10  offset from the others , that point was discarded for this solution .",
    "initially these points were merely re - weighted , but later discarded as spurious data .",
    "the total number of observations so discarded was less than 1% of the aggregate data .",
    "this improved our goodness of fit ( @xmath25 /degrees of freedom ) measurement of the modelling for the rv data set from 0.94 in the announcement paper to 0.30 in the current analysis .",
    "solving for relative parallax , proper motion , and orbital motion , using astrometry and radial velocities simultaneously , the model now becomes ,    @xmath64    @xmath65    where orbit is a function ( through thiele - innes constants ) of the traditional astrometric and radial velocity orbital elements listed in table  [ tbl - orb ] .",
    "the period ( p ) , the epoch of passage through periastron in years ( t ) , the eccentricity ( e ) and the angle in the plane of the true orbit between the line of nodes and the major axis ( @xmath66 ) , are constrained to be equal for the radial velocity and astrometry portions of the model .",
    "only radial velocity provides information with which to determine the half - amplitudes ( @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 , the systemic velocity .",
    "combining radial velocity observations from different sources is possible with gaussfit , which has the ability to simultaneously solve for many separate velocity offsets ( because velocities from different sources are relative , having differing zero points ) , along with the other orbital parameters .",
    "we force a relationship between the astrometry and the radial velocity by a constraint from @xcite @xmath69 where quantities derived only from astrometry ( parallax , @xmath70 , primary perturbation orbit size , @xmath71 , and inclination , @xmath3 ) are on the left , and quantities derivable from both ( the period , @xmath72 and eccentricity , @xmath73 ) , or radial velocities only ( the radial velocity amplitude for the primary , @xmath67 ) , are on the right .    combining rv measurements complete through 2006.3 ( table  [ tbl - rv ] ) , all the astrometric measurements , and the equation 10 constraint , we solve for parallax , proper motion , and the semi - major axis , orbit orientation , and orbit inclination for the perturbation caused by the companion . for the parameters critical in determining the mass of @xmath0  eri  we find a parallax , @xmath74 mas and a proper motion @xmath75 mas y@xmath10 in position angle 2690 @xmath1 06 .",
    "table  [ tbl - sum ] compares values for the parallax and proper motion of @xmath0  eri  from _ hst _ and _ hipparcos_. we note satisfactory agreement . our precision and extended study duration",
    "have significantly improved the accuracy and precision of the parallax and proper motion of @xmath0  eri .    at this stage",
    "we can assess the reality of any @xmath0  eri  perturbation by plotting residuals to a model that does not include an orbit .",
    "figure  [ fig - orbxy ] shows the x and y components of only the higher - precision astrometry fgs residuals plotted as grey dots .",
    "the lower precision map data were not considered in the determination of the orbital parameters .",
    "we also plot normal points formed from those dots at nine epochs .",
    "finally , each plot contains as a dashed line the x and y components of the perturbation we find by including an orbit in our modeling .",
    "we find a perturbation size , @xmath76 mas , and an inclination , @xmath77= 301 @xmath1 38 .",
    "these , and the other orbital elements for the perturbation , are listed in table  [ tbl - orb ] with 1-@xmath78 errors .",
    "errors generated by gaussfit ( jefferys 1988 ) come from a maximum likelihood estimation that is an approximation to a bayesian maximum a posteriori estimator with a flat prior ( jefferys 1990 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - pjconstemp ] illustrates the pourbaix and jorrisen relation ( equation 10 ) between parameters obtained from astrometry ( left - side ) and radial velocities ( right side ) and our final estimates for @xmath71 and @xmath3 . as seen in tables  [ tbl - sum ] and [ tbl - orb ] , most of the errors of the terms in equation 10 are quite small .",
    "in essence , our simultaneous solution uses the figure  [ fig - pjconstemp ] curve as a quasi - bayesian prior , sliding along it until the astrometric and radial velocity residuals are minimized .",
    "gross deviations from the curve are minimized by the high precision of many of the terms in equation 10 .",
    "figure  [ fig - rvs ] contains all radial velocity measures and the predicted velocity curve from the simultaneous solution .",
    "compared to the typical perturbation radial velocity curve ( e.g. hatzes 2005 , mcarthur 2004 , cochran 2004 ) , figure  [ fig - rvs ] exhibits far more scatter about the derived orbit .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "the perturbation amplitude is small ( k1=18.5 m s@xmath10  ) , and @xmath0  eri   is an active star , as discussed in hatzes ( 2000 ) . reiterating their conclusions , none of the activity cycles have periods commensurate with the planetary perturbation period .",
    "figure  [ fig - orbresids ] presents the astrometric residuals and the derived perturbation orbit for the primary star , @xmath0  eri .",
    "stellar activity has even less of an effect on astrometry at our level of precision .",
    "a star spot covering 30% of the surface would induce a photocenter shift of less than 0.2 mas ( sozzetti 2005 ) . the astrometry confirms the existence of the companion .",
    "our analysis of the radial velocities ( now spanning over 25 years , all shown in figure  [ fig - rvs ] ) included a linear drift term , a change in velocity as a function of time .",
    "this drift is clearly seen in the overplotted final radial velocity curve , and amounts to 0.32 @xmath1 0.05 m s@xmath10  yr@xmath10 .",
    "such a change can be caused by longer - period companions and/or secular acceleration @xcite .",
    "the secular acceleration expected for @xmath0  eri  is ( van de kamp , 1967 ) quite small , 0.07 m s@xmath10  yr@xmath10 .",
    "the trend we find is over four times larger than the predicted secular acceleration , and is approximately the acceleration one might find for a planet similar in mass to @xmath0  eri   b , but with a 50100 year period .",
    "figure 9 shows sufficient enough overlap among the many velocity data sets that the trend is unlikely an artifact due to a mismatch in the center of mass velocity offsets ( discussed above ) obtained for each set .",
    "typical offset random error is @xmath79 m s@xmath10  .",
    "while this acceleration is not a detection of the longer - period companion ( @xmath80 au ) invoked by quillan & thorndike ( 2002 ) and ozernoy ( 2000 ) to modify the dust distribution as discussed below in section 7 , it may ( with a semimajor axis 1020 au ) be at least partially responsible for the inner cavity in the dust disk distribution imaged by greaves ( 2005 ) .",
    "the astrometric motion over 15 years due to this possible tertiary would be of order 3 mas and difficult to separate from proper motion , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the planetary mass depends on the mass of the primary star , for which we have adopted @xmath81 @xcite . for this @xmath82",
    "we find @xmath83 .",
    "the companion is clearly an extrasolar giant planet . in table",

    "is directly detected , its radius is unknown . from a review of exoplanet masses and radii @xcite ,",
    "a radius of @xmath85 seems reasonable .",

    "the dominant sources of error for the separations are the eccentricity ( 6% ) and the @xmath0  eri  b planet mass ( 15% ) .",
    "our accurate mass and orbital parameters for this planetary companion have value for future direct imaging projects .",

    "saffe ( 2005 ) used the calibrations of donahue ( 1993 ) and rocha - pinto & maciel ( 1998 ) ( which corrected the age with an effect from stellar metallicity ) to estimate ages of 0.66 and 0.82 gyr , respectively .",

    "the sub - mm bolometer , simba , provided observational confirmation of this extended dust disk ( schutz 2004 ) .",
    "the stis ccd camera on _ hst  _ took deep optical images around @xmath0  eri  in an effort to find an optical counterpart for the sub - millimeter observations .",
    "these measurements did not provide clear evidence for the detection of that optical counterpart , but did place a limit on the optical surface brightness of the dust , that it could not be brighter than approximately 25 stmag arcsec@xmath104 , which places constraints on the nature and amount of the smallest dust grains ( proffit 2004 ) .",
    "observational and theoretical searches for the signature of planetary / brown dwarf objects in the structure of the dust disk around @xmath0  eri  are underway",
    ". clumps seen in the ring are thought to come from the interaction between the disk and a massive planetary body ( holland 2003 ) .",
    "adaptive optics on the keck telescope were used to search for extrasolar planets .",
    "these studies found no evidence of brown dwarf or planetary companions down to 5 jupiter masses at the angular separations comparable to that of the dust rings ( macintosh 2003 ) .",
    "spitzer space telescope ( sst ) observations made with the multi - band imaging photometer ( mips ) and the infrred spectograph ( irs ) have confirmed the disk and provided evidence for asymmetries in the structure of the disk that may have been caused by the gravitational perturbation of sub - stellar companions ( marengo 2004 ) .",
    "two recent studies suggested that debris disks and long - period planets co - exist , with planetary bodies sculpting the disk .",
    "@xmath0  eri  is the prototypical system .",
    "first , high - resolution modeling of the structure of the disk around @xmath0  eri  predict an angular motion of the asymmetry of the disk of about 06 - 08 yr@xmath10 ( ozervnoy 2000 ) . secondly , quillen & thorndike ( 2002 ) carried out numerical simulations of dust particles captured in mean motions resonances with a hypothetical planet ( e = 0.3 , m = @xmath105 m@xmath106 , a = 40 au ) at periastron .",
    "these produced a dust distribution that agreed with the morphology of the dust ring around @xmath0  eri  presented by greaves ( 1998 , 2005 ) .",
    "an investigation into the dynamics of the dust ring around @xmath0  eri  ( moran , kuchner & holman , 2004 ) concluded that the eccentricity of the dust released in the inner ring ( @xmath8720 au ) could reveal patterns in the dust which could confirm the existence of the planet reported by hatzes ( 2000 ) .",
    "we determined an inclination of @xmath3=301 @xmath1 32 for @xmath0  eri  b. our measured inclination is consistent with the previously measured dust disk inclination from 450 and 850 @xmath107 m maps of @xcite , @xmath108 .",
    "this suggests that the dust disk and plane of the orbit of @xmath0  eri  b are coincident and that the dust distribution is nearly circular .",
    "this provides support for hiearchical accretion models for planet formation @xcite , where coplanar dust and a debris disk are expected remnants of planet formation ( tsiganis 2005 ) .",
    "lastly , @xmath0  eri  b and the possible tertiary deduced from the linear trend in the radial velocities ( section 6 ) would most likely eject particles that would spiral inward , and recent scuba submillimeter observations have shown that the center of the disk is relatively excavated of dust , with half or less of the signals seen in the ring ( greaves 2005 ) .",
    "analyzing three years of _ hst _ fgs and over 14 years of allegheny observatory map astrometry , we find an independently determined parallax and proper motion for @xmath0  eri   that agree within the errors with hipparcos .",
    "astrometric observations with _",
    "hst  _ fgs , combined with long - duration allegheny map astrometry and ground based radial velocities , have confirmed the existence of the planet orbiting @xmath0  eri , first suggested by walker ( 1995 ) , noted by cummings ( 1999 ) , and finally announced by hatzes ( 2000 ) .    combining the astrometry with radial velocities from six different sources , spanning 25 years , and applying the pourbaix & jorrisen constraint between astrometry and radial velocities",
    ", we obtain for the perturbing object @xmath0  eri  b a period , p=6.85 @xmath1 0.02 y , inclination , @xmath3=301 @xmath1 32 , and perturbation semimajor axis , @xmath76 mas .",
    "assuming for @xmath0  eri  a stellar mass @xmath82 = 0.83@xmath10.05@xmath109 , we obtain a mass for @xmath0  eri  b , @xmath84 = 1.55@xmath10.24@xmath8 .",
    "this companion inclination matches the disk inclination determined by greaves ( 2005 ) .",
    "our astrometry predicts for @xmath0  eri  b periastron passage at t@xmath86 = 2007.29 , with a separation @xmath603 in position angle -27(a = 3.39 au ) . at the next apastron , to occur 2010.71 , the separation should be 17 in position angle 153 .",
    "the orbital geometry suggests that 2007.97 ( late december 2007 ) is the most favorable time for direct detection in reflected light . for an @xmath0  eri   age @xmath6850",
    "my and our determined mass , @xmath0  eri  b will have an intrinsic luminosity @xmath89 , 4.67@xmath94 times fainter in bolometric luminosity than @xmath0  eri .",
    "radial velocities spanning 25 years indicate a long - term linear trend , an acceleration consistent with a jupiter - mass object with a period of 50100 years .",
    "this is a possible detection of a tertiary companion responsible for a major feature of the dust morphology , the central cavity .",
