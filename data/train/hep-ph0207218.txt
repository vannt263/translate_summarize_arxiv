    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) are becoming one of the main topics of interest in hadronic physics @xcite .",
    "gpds are a natural bridge between exclusive processes , such as elastic scattering , described in terms of form factors , and inclusive ones , described in terms of structure functions .",
    "as it happens for the usual parton distributions ( pds ) , the measurement of gpds provides us with a unique way to access several features of the structure of the nucleon , such as the quark orbital angular momentum contribution to the proton spin @xcite .",
    "therefore , relevant experimental efforts to measure gpds will take place in the next few years and it becomes urgent to produce predictions for these quantities .",
    "several calculations have been already performed by using different approaches @xcite and an impressive effort has been devoted to study their qcd evolution properties @xcite .",
    "a step towards calculations of gpds in constituent quark models ( cqm ) can be found in @xcite , and a consistent approach has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the cqm has a long story of successful predictions in low energy studies of the structure of the nucleon . in the high energy sector , in order to compare model predictions with data , one has to evolve , according to qcd , the leading twist component of the physical structure functions obtained at the low momentum scale associated with the model .",
    "such a procedure , already addressed in @xcite , has proven successful in describing the gross features of standard pds by using different cqm ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similar expectations motivated the study of gpds described in @xcite , where a simple formalism is described to calculate gpds from any model . in this talk ,",
    "the approach of @xcite is reviewed and applied to the isgur and karl ( ik ) @xcite model .",
    "let us think to diffractive dis off a nucleon target , with initial and final momenta @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "gpds describe the amplitude for finding a quark with momentum fraction @xmath2 ( in the imf ) in the nucleon and replacing it back into the nucleon with a momentum transfer @xmath3 .",
    "the gpd @xmath4 is introduced by defining the twist - two part of the light - cone correlation function @xcite @xmath5 + where ellipses denote higher - twist contributions , @xmath6 is a quark field and m is the nucleon mass .",
    "the @xmath7 variable , the so called `` skewedness '' , is defined by the relation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 depends on the reference frame .",
    "the @xmath7 variable is bounded by 0 and @xmath11 . besides",
    ", one has @xmath12 .",
    "when the longitudinal momentum fraction of the quark is less than @xmath13 , gpds describe antiquarks ; when it is larger than @xmath14 , they describe quarks ; when it is between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , they describe @xmath15 pairs .",
    "there are two natural limits for @xmath4 : i ) when @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 , the so called `` forward '' limit , one recovers the usual pds @xmath18 ii ) the integration over @xmath19 yields the dirac form factor ( ff ) @xmath20 any model estimate of the gpds has to respect the above two crucial constraints .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the impulse approximation ( ia ) expression for the gpd @xmath4 , suitable to perform cqm calculations , has been obtained .",
    "in particular it has been found that , substituting the quark fields in the left - hand - side of eq.(1 ) , taking into account the quarks degrees of freedom only , using ia , considering a process with @xmath21 in the nucleon rest frame , using a symmetric wave function ( as the one given in a nr quark model once color has been taken into account ) , one obtains @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the one - body non - diagonal momentum distribution : @xmath24 defined through the one - body non diagonal charge density @xmath25    -2.5 cm",
    "-2.5 cm    eq . ( 4 ) allows the calculation of the gpd @xmath4 in any cqm , and it naturally verifies the two crucial constraints , eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) @xcite . with respect to eq .",
    "( 4 ) , a few caveats are necessary . due to the use of cqm wave functions , only quarks gpds can be evaluated , i.e. , only the region @xmath26 can be explored .",
    "the approach has to be improved in order to study the sea region ( @xmath27 ) . besides , in the argument of the @xmath28 function in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , due to the used approximations , the @xmath19 variable is not defined in its natural support , i.e. it can be larger than 1 .",
    "although the support violation is small in most models , this problem has to be considered a serious drawback of all cqm calculations of parton distributions , in particular if pqcd evolution of the model prediction is performed .",
    "we stress that our definition of the gpd @xmath4 can be easily generalized to other gpds , which can be obtained in any cqm .",
    "we consider the isgur - karl model @xcite , with a proton wave function given by a harmonic oscillator potential including contributions up to the @xmath29 shell . in this case",
    "the proton state is given by the following admixture of states      where we have used the spectroscopic notation @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the symmetry type .",
    "the coefficients were determined by spectroscopic properties to be : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .        the obtained behavior of the ff is shown in fig .",
    "1 . as it is well known , such a ff underestimates the data at high @xmath37 .",
    "results evaluated using the ik model , eq . ( 7 ) , in the general formula , eq .",
    "( 4 ) , are shown in figs .",
    "2 to 4 . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the @xmath37 dependence of our results .",
    "the full line corresponds to the usual pd .",
    "one immediately realizes that a strong @xmath37 dependence is found , in comparison with other estimates , for example , with the one in @xcite .",
    "this has to do with the too a strong @xmath37 dependence of the ff in the ik model . in figs .",
    "3 and 4 we have the full @xmath37 and @xmath7 dependences .",
    "these are similar to the ones obtained in @xcite , although the @xmath7 dependence is stronger .",
    "our results for @xmath4 correspond to the low momentum scale associated with the model . in order to compare them with the data which are going to be taken in future experiments",
    ", one has to evolve them to the experimental high - momentum scale .",
    "the proposed approach can have many interesting developments , such as the use of more realistic models , the inclusion of qcd evolution from the scale of the model to the experimental one , the addition of corrections due to relativistic dynamics , or the ones due to a possible finite size and complex structure of the constituent quarks , as proposed by several authors @xcite .",
