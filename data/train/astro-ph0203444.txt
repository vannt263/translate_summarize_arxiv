    "polars are close binaries in which the primary star ( a white dwarf ) accretes material from a red dwarf secondary star .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field of the white dwarf ( b@xmath010200 mg ) is sufficient to synchronize its spin period with that of the binary orbital period .",
    "the accretion flow is controlled over large distances by the white dwarf s magnetic field . in most of these systems the magnetic field is locked into a single orientation with respect to the secondary star .",
    "there are , however , four polars which are known not to be exactly synchronous : the spin period of the white dwarf differs from the orbital period by a few percent .",
    "it is expected that these systems are only temporarily out of phase - lock ( due to eg a nova explosion ) and will regain synchronization within several hundred years ( schmidt & stockman 1991 ) .",
    "one of the brightest of these asynchronous polars is by cam .",
    "it is bright in x - rays and has an binary orbital period of 201.258 mins and a white dwarf with a spin period of 199.330 mins ( mason et al 1998 ) .",
    "this results in a spin - orbit beat period of 14.5 days .    by cam",
    "has been observed with various x - ray telescopes .",
    "indeed , it was discovered using the x - ray satellite _ uhuru _ by forman et al ( 1978 ) . since then it has been observed using _",

    "these observations have shown a highly variable x - ray light curve .",
    "this variability is best shown in the _ ginga _ data which was taken over 3 days and showed a periodic modulation in the first half which disappeared in the second half and was thereafter dominated by strong flaring .",
    "this is consistent with x - ray observations of one other asynchronous polar rx j211558 which showed highly variable light curves ( ramsay et al 2000 ) .",
    "this variability was interpreted as the accretion flow rotating around the magnetic field of the white dwarf and at certain instances the flow accretes onto the opposite hemisphere of the white dwarf resulting in a different shaped light curve .",
    "the hard x - ray spectra of by cam has shown evidence for a multi - temperature nature and complex absorption ( done & magdziarz 1998 ) . using _ rosat _",
    "data , ramsay et al ( 1994 ) found that by cam was the one system which did not show a soft / hard x - ray ratio which was correlated with magnetic field strength . in this paper",
    "we present x - ray and simultaneous optical / uv observations of by cam using _ xmm - newton_.",
    "by cam was observed for a short duration using _ xmm - newton _ on 26 august 2001 .",
    "we show in table 1 the observation details in the various instruments .",
    "the epic instruments ( imaging detectors covering the energy range 0.110kev with moderate spectra resolution ) were operated in small window mode so that the effects of pile - up would be minimised .",
    "the rgs detectors ( high resolution spectrographs operating in the 0.32.0kev range : den herder et al 2001 ) were configured in the standard spectroscopy mode . for the om ( an optical / uv 30 cm telescope : mason et al 2001 ) , data in 2 uv filters were obtained ( uvw1 : peak effective area at 2900   and bandwidth 750  uvw2 : 2120  450  ) and one visual band ( roughly the @xmath1 band , 5500  350  ) .",
    "the data were processed using the _ xmm - newton _ _ science analysis software _ ( sas ) v5.2 . for the epic pn detector ( strder et al 2001 ) , data were extracted using an aperture of 40@xmath2 arc sec centered on the source .",
    "background data were extracted from a source free region of the same ccd . for the epic mos detectors ( turner et al 2001 ) we extracted the background from source free regions of other ccds which were in full frame mode .",
    "the background data were scaled and subtracted from the source data .",
    "the om data were analysed in a similar way using omfchain ( using the version due to be released as part of the sas v5.3 ) .",
    "data were corrected for background subtraction and coincidence losses ( mason et al 2001 ) .",
    "background subtracted rgs spectra were derived using the sas tool rgsproc .    in extracting the epic pn spectra",

    "various groups have searched for a correlation between the soft and hard x - ray light curves of polars .",
    "observations of am her ( stella , beuermann & patterson 1986 ) showed no correlation between the soft and hard x - ray light curves while observations of ef eri ( watson , king & williams 1987 ) found that the soft and hard x - ray light curves were weakly correlated at zero lag . however , in both of these cases , the ` soft ' x - ray light curve extended up to 2kev or beyond and hence their ` soft ' band may have been contaminated by photons originating from the post - shock flow . with the good spectral resolution of _",
    "xmm - newton _ we have been able to separate the soft re - processed x - ray emission from the post - shock emission .",
    "in  3.2 we found evidence that the hard x - ray light curve trailed the softest x - ray light curve by @xmath01040sec and was anti - correlated .",
    "this is an unexpected result .",
    "the emission at energies 0.10.3kev is produced by a combination of hard x - rays irradiating the white dwarf and then being re - radiated at lower energies ( lamb & masters 1979 , king & lasota 1979 ) , and dense blobs of material penetrating the photosphere of the white dwarf ( kuijpers & pringle 1982 ) .",
    "the proportion of blobs present in the accretion flow is thought to be proportional to the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf ( ramsay et al 1994 ) . at energies above @xmath01kev",
    "the emission is due entirely from x - rays produced in the post - shock region above the photosphere of the white dwarf .",
    "if soft x - rays were produced largely from the re - processing of hard x - rays then they would be expected to be correlated ( it is possible there would be a short time delay with the soft band trailing the hard since it would take a finite time for the hard x - rays to be reprocessed ) .",
    "we suggest that the observed delayed anti - correlation is due to dense blobs of material impacting the photosphere of the white dwarf which then throw - up enough optically thick material to obscure even hard x - rays for a short time . supporting evidence",
    "is found from the spectral fits which indicate the absorption is significantly higher in the soft accretion region spectrum compared to the hard accretion region spectrum .",
    "the rgs spectra show the presence of line emission at 0.426 and 0.500 kev .",
    "these lines appear to be due to nvi and nvii .",
    "we believe that this is the first time that nitrogen lines have been seen in the x - ray spectra of a cv .",
    "this observation is interesting since bonnet - biduad & mouchet ( 1987 ) using _ iue _ spectra found that the ratio of nv / civ is unusually large - around a factor of 20 greater than normally found in polars .",
    "they suggested that this unusual ratio was due to a previous nova event in the system .",
    "the lines detected in the x - ray band are of course more ionised that those seen in the uv but their origin ( whether in the pre - shock accretion flow , circumbinary material or from the white dwarf photosphere ) , is still unclear .",
    "another significant result from our spectral fitting is the finding that no blackbody component is seen in the ` hard ' accretion region while it is in the ` soft ' accretion region .",
    "a soft x - ray component has been seen in many polars , but there are examples where none have been detected .",
    "the polar ww hor was observed using _ xmm - newton _ ( ramsay et al 2001 ) in an intermediate accretion state and no soft x - ray component was detected .",
    "further , the soft and hard x - ray light curves are almost always seen in phase .",
    "however , there have been some observations where the soft and hard x - ray components have been seen in anti - phase ( the ` reversed x - ray mode ' ) .",
    "one example is the observation of am her made using _",
    "( heise et al 1985 ) .",
    "this observation contrasts with other observations of am her which show the soft and hard light curves in phase .",
    "heise et al ( 1985 ) suggest that am her normally accretes only onto one magnetic pole , but in the reversed x - ray mode , accretion occurs onto both poles .",
    "when accreting onto only one pole ( the primary pole ) , both soft and hard x - rays are generated .",
    "when accretion occurs on the secondary pole , accretion takes place in the form of dense blobs of material which penetrate directly the white dwarf photosphere and no shock is formed : this pole is therefore strong in soft x - rays .",
    "polarimetric observations of by cam by piirola et al ( 1994 ) show evidence for positive and negative circular polarisation , implying the presence of two accretion poles .    dealing with the ` soft ' pole first",
    ", there is clear evidence of short term variations in the soft x - ray light curve ( at least in the second half of the soft light curve ) .",
    "since there are no short term variations in the hard x - ray light curve , the most probable mechanism for the soft flaring is dense blobs of material which impact directly into the white dwarf .",
    "this would be expected to reflected in a high @xmath3 ratio .",
    "in contrast , the fits to the spectrum of the soft accretion region imply a ratio @xmath00.5 which is consistent with the ` standard ' accretion model in which the soft x - ray emission originates entirely from re - processing of hard x - rays .",
    "however , when we consider the spectrum taken from the only the flaring state , we find that the soft / hard ratio increases by a factor of 4 .",
    "this is consistent with the view that dense blobs of material are indeed present in the flow and are the cause of flaring in soft x - rays .",
    "we now discuss the hard accretion region . compared to the soft accretion region",
    ", the hard region shows a light curve which is much more constant in intensity .",
    "this suggests the absence of dense blobs of material impacting onto this accretion pole .",
    "however , we would still expect there to be a soft x - ray component from re - processing of the hard x - ray component .",
    "if the accretion rate was reduced ( the hard x - ray flux is a factor @xmath05 lower in this region compared to the soft region ) or the flow was spread over a larger area than usual , then the temperature of the re - processed component would be lower .",
    "this would result in the re - processed component being shifted into uv wavebands .",
    "indeed , figure 1 shows that the uvw1 count rate is high when the hard region is in view .    to investigate this further ,",
    "we re - considered the soft accretion region spectrum by adding a blackbody of temperature 1.7ev ( 20000k , gnsicke , beuermann & de martino 1998 ) to account for that part of the white dwarf not heated by the accretion flow .",
    "we then set the normalisation of this component to match the flux observed in the uvw2 filter .",
    "we then added this low temperature blackbody to our model for the hard accretion region .",
    "we find that the observed flux in the uvw1 filter is higher by a factor @xmath02 than predicted .",
    "we now add a second blackbody to account for a re - processed component : this is fixed at various temperatures and normalisations so that it gives the observed uvw1 flux and has no significant effect on the fit to the x - ray spectra .",
    "we find that for a heated region of temperature @xmath04ev ( as opposed to 54ev in the soft accretion region ) , we find @xmath41 .",
    "( here we set sec(@xmath5)=1 appropriate for the positively circularly polarised pole which we take to be the hard accretion region , piirola et al 1994 ) .",
    "some degree of caution should be applied there are uncertainties in the exact temperature of the unheated white dwarf , the precise uv flux estimates and the amount of absorption .",
    "however , this supports our view that the lack of a distinct soft x - ray component in the hard accretion region is because this component has moved into the uv as a result of the lower hard x - ray heating rate , or that it is spread over a larger area compared to the soft accretion pole .",
    "this is similar to that observed in am her ( gnsicke , beuermann & de martino 1998 ) .",
