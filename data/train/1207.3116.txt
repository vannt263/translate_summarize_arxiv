    "we will analyze the relationship of expansiveness , existence of periodic orbits and injectivity of the itinerary map for the 3 cases analyzed above : flat , hyperbolic and spherical .",
    "expansiveness of a dynamical system is a stronger version of sensitivity of initial conditions and so it is related with chaotic systems .",

    ".        roughly speaking the expansiveness of the billiard flow can be contradicted just by two facts : 1 ) there are two points with the same itinerary and 2 ) there are two points @xmath48 and @xmath179 such that @xmath196 and @xmath197 with @xmath45 and @xmath92 singular points .",
