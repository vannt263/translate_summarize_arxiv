    "wind energy is a major source of renewable energy .",
    "however , conventional wind turbines are restricted by physical and economic limits .",
    "airborne wind energy has the potential to overcome some of the limitations , using tethered flying devices to reach altitudes of 400 to 600 m where the wind is stronger and steadier @xcite .",
    "the fact that airborne wind energy systems do not require towers reduces the costs per installation significantly .",
    "the focus of this paper is the modelling of airborne wind energy systems that use the traction power of a tethered inflatable wing in a pumping cycle , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main components of such a single - tether kite power system ( kps ) are the wing , the kite control unit ( kcu ) suspended below the wing by means of a bridle system , the tether and the drum - generator module , which is part of the ground station .",
    "it is the objective to develop a system model that is real - time capable and of sufficient accuracy for the development and verification of flight path and ground station controllers . a dynamic model of a two - line kite",
    "is derived in @xcite .",
    "variations of the angle of attack are not taken into account and the simplicity of the model allows for an analytical derivation of a state space representation based on four dynamic states . further expanding on this model",
    ", @xcite proposed a kite power system model with three degrees of freedom ( dof ) , in which the kite is represented as a point mass at the end of the straight tether of variable length .",
    "assuming a rigid wing with constant aerodynamic properties , the steering forces are derived as functions of the roll angle .",
    "a discretisation of the tether as a multibody system has been proposed by @xcite , using a lagrangian approach to derive the equations of motion in generalised coordinates .",
    "the advantage of this approach is the direct incorporation of constrains which results in a compact problem formulation .",
    "this model used rigid tether segments , connected by spherical joints , which is not sufficient for modelling the tether force and implementing the force control loop .",
    "in addition it is adding and removing point masses during the simulation to simulate reel - out and reel - in of the tether . according to our experience",
    "this causes artificial discontinuities in the model which makes it difficult to implement the force control loop . for the kite it also used a point mass model .",
    "a model that uses a discretised tether with point masses connected by springs was published in @xcite .",
    "the aerodynamics of the kite were modelled using the vortex lattice method , which means that it is using an advanced kite model . on the other hand",
    "it was not mentioned if the dynamics of the winch were modelled at all and no details were published on the question how reeling in and out was modelled .",
    "other authors presented detailed generator and winch models @xcite , but no or only a very simple model for the kite and the tether .",
    "coupling fluid and structural dynamic solvers for wind turbine applications has been studied by @xcite , while fluid - structure interactions methods have been applied to kite aeroelastic behaviour by @xcite .",
    "these kind of models might be useful for the design of improved kites , but they are very computational intensive and currently at least one order of magnitude slower than real - time  @xcite",
    ".    this paper presents a model where the dynamics of all major system components - the tether , the kite and the generator - are taken into account , with a focus on a novel discretised tether model which allows smooth reel - in and reel - out .",
    "it is soft real - time capable and thus suitable for the training of kite pilots and winch operators , but can also be used for software in the loop testing of kps control systems , the development of estimation algorithms and for the optimization of flight trajectories .",
    "an improved one - point kite model is presented , that allows to change the angle of attack during simulation time and uses look - up tables to calculate the lift and drag as function of the angle of attack .",
    "it also takes the increased drag when flying around corners into account .",
    "in addition it uses a correction term to match the influence of gravity .",
    "this model can already be sufficient for optimizing flight trajectories .    for controller development a four - point kite model",
    "is devised , the most simple point mass model that has rotational inertial in all axis .",
    "this avoids discontinuities in the kite orientation which make the one - point kite model uncontrollable in curtain flight manoeuvres .",
    "in addition it is very close to a fully physical model : many model parameters like the height and width of the kite and the height of the bridle can just be measured and do not need to be identified . only the steering sensitivity parameters need to be identified because they depend on the flexibility of the kite which is not explicitly modelled .",
    "this article will first explain the atmospheric model , then the tether model and the two kite models and finally the winch model .",
    "furthermore , the control system is briefly explained .",
    "subsequently a systematic approach for the model calibration is presented , with the goal to match the conditions of a real flight as good as possible .    in the results section major parameters like force , speed , power and flight trajectory as obtained from the point mass model and the four point model",
    "are compared with data , measured using the hydra kite of delft university of technology .",
    "finally conclusions are drawn about the performance and accuracy of the described models and which improvements are still needed .",
    "one of the requirements when building the model was , that it has to be ( soft- ) real - time capable .",
    "on the other hand , the programming effort should be limited and it should be easy to adapt the model to different kite power systems .",
    "it was found that high - level modelling tools like simulink or modellica were not capable to simulate a discretised tether that is reeling in or out in real - time .",
    "therefore general purpose programming language was used that makes low - level optimizations of the modelling code possible .",
    "we are modelling the kite and the tether as a particle system , using discrete point masses which are connected by spring - damper elements .",
    "this has the advantage of a coherent model structure for which efficient mathematical methods for solving the stiff equation system exist @xcite",
    ". for describing the positions of the particles a ground fixed reference frame is used , where the x - axis is pointing east , the y - axis north and the z - axis upwards .",
    "the origin is placed at the ground station .",
    "the state vector of the system was constructed using the states of the tether particles , the states of the kite particles ( only needed for the the four point kite model , because otherwise the last tether particle also represents the kite ) and the scalar states of the winch ( generator ) . because no accurate , real - time measurements of the wind speed at the height of the kite were available , an atmospheric model , describing the wind profile ,",
    "was also needed .      to determine the wind speed @xmath4 at the height of the kite and at the height of each tether segment ,",
    "the power law @xcite and the log law @xcite are used .",
    "input parameters are the ground wind speed @xmath5 and the current height @xmath6 of the kite or tether segment .",
    "the ground wind speed used in this paper was measured at @xmath7 .",
    "the power law establishes the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath5 as @xmath8 with the exponent @xmath9 as fitting parameter .",
    "the logarithmic law , which according to @xcite is more accurate than the least - square power law , can be written in the following form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reference height and @xmath12 is the roughness length . for this paper",
    "not only the ground wind speed @xmath5 is measured , but once per flight additionally the wind speed at two more heights , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "then , a wind profile is fitted to these three wind speeds . to make a fit with three ( speed , height ) pairs possible , eqns .",

    ".    an average sea - level density of @xmath20 kg / m@xmath21 is assumed , and the height dependency is calculated according to @xmath22 where @xmath6 is the height and @xmath23 km .",

    "the presented models have shown to be easily adaptable and well suited for flight path optimization and the development of kps estimators and kps controllers .",
    "while the corrected one - point model with an adapted flight path controller can be sufficient for flight - path optimization , the four point model is better suited for controller validation in a broader range of flight conditions .    even though the accuracy of the predicted power output is not yet sufficiently validated , the one point model , using the correction according to eq .",
    "[ eq : correction ] is predicting the influence of gravity on the turn rate much better than uncorrected point mass models and the four point model has a much more realistic dynamic response to the steering input then simpler models while still being real - time capable .",
