    "in order to inject atoms into the magnetic guide , we use a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) based upon four laser beams in a tetrahedral configuration superimposed with a magnetic two - dimensional quadrupole field .",
    "the setup consists of a moving molasses @xcite in the longitudinal direction combined with cooling and confining forces in the transverse directions and will be called _ injecting mot _ in the following .",
    "a detailed description can be found in @xcite .",
    "the injecting mot allows to capture atoms entering the trapping volume with a velocity @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a function of the available laser power , and to subsequently slow the atoms down to the final velocity @xmath9 which only depends on the relative frequencies of the laser beams . in this way we produce an atomic beam with a temperature on the order of 50 @xmath10k and a velocity in the range of 30 cm / s to 3 m / s .",
    "if the injecting mot is loaded from a rubidium background gas with vapor pressure @xmath11 , it captures atoms at a rate proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "however , collisions between captured and thermal background atoms will limit the flux @xmath12 of outgoing atoms to @xmath13 where @xmath14 depends on the characteristic length of the trap and the collision cross section .",
    "this process sets an upper limit @xmath15 to the flux that can be achieved .",
    "it decreases as @xmath16 with decreasing velocity @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath17 , it also limits the collision rate in the magnetic guide provided that the temperature and the confining force of the guide are unchanged . in our previous setup @xcite",
    ", we were able to produce a flux of @xmath18 atoms / s at @xmath19 m / s and a pressure @xmath20 mbar . in order to overcome this limitation",
    ", we have to operate the injecting mot in an ultra - high vacuum chamber .    for this purpose , many techniques have been developed .",
    "thermal beams can be slowed down by means of a zeeman slower @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a collimated beam of atoms can be obtained by a vapor - loaded mot with a leak at its center .",
    "for instance , one can drill a hole in one of the mirrors of a mot @xcite ) , or use a pyramidal mirror structure with a hole at its vertex @xcite , or use an extra pushing beam , which destabilizes the mot at its center @xcite . a third method for producing a cold beam of atoms relies on a 2d - mot @xcite .",
    "all these sources produce a relatively intense beam ( from 10@xmath21 to several @xmath1 atoms per second ) , with an average velocity @xmath22 between 10 and 50  m / s . in our setup , we have implemented the 2d - mot scheme .",
    "we note that the relation ( [ flux ] ) also applies to the source producing the atomic beam",
    ". however , it is much less restrictive since the atomic velocities at its exit are orders of magnitude higher than in the injecting mot .",
    "a schematic drawing of the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the first mot is located in a rectangular quartz cell ( 80 mm @xmath23 45 mm @xmath23 45 mm ) connected to a rubidium reservoir by a valve ( not shown in fig",
    ".  [ setup ] ) and joined to the main part of the vacuum system by a differential pumping tube .",
    "it is a vapor - loaded two - dimensional mot based on a design that has been characterized in detail in @xcite . for a thermal atom to be captured by the mot , firstly it needs to have a transverse velocity smaller than the mot s capture velocity .",
    "secondly , the atom s longitudinal velocity @xmath24 has to be low enough so that the transit time @xmath25 ( @xmath26 being the length of the mot ) is sufficiently long for the atom to be transversally trapped and cooled . in this way the 2d - mot produces two beams of atoms which leave the trap on axis in opposite directions .",
    "two pairs of elongated coils in anti - helmholtz configuration produce a two - dimensional quadrupole magnetic field whose zero - field line is parallel to the optical table and centered with respect to the glass cell .",
    "typical field gradients are on the order of 12 g / cm .",
    "the cooling laser light for the mot is produced by a tapered amplifier providing up to 450 mw of light .",
    "the amplifier is injected by a grating - stabilized diode laser which is red - detuned by @xmath27 from the @xmath28 transition .",
    "a second grating - stabilized diode laser tuned to the @xmath29 transition is used to injection - lock another laser diode which provides up to 30 mw of repumping light .",
    "the cooling and repumping laser beams are superposed and split into two beams which are subsequently circularly polarized . after widening the beams by telescopes to a beam waist of 13 mm",
    ", the beams are steered to the quartz cell which they pass perpendicular to each other and to the zero - field line of the magnetic field .",
    "they are then retro - reflected after having passed another quarter - wave plate , thus providing the third and forth beam of the mot .",
    "we find that the resulting intensity imbalance between the ingoing and the retro - reflected beams does not significantly perturb the functioning of the trap .",
    "typically , the trap is operated at a total rubidium background pressure of @xmath30 mbar .",
    "it is located close to the entrance of a differential pumping tube , with a diameter @xmath31 mm and a length @xmath32 mm , capable of maintaining a pressure ratio of more than two orders of magnitude between the first quartz cell and the cell of the injecting mot .",
    "the total distance between the first and the second mot is @xmath33 mm .",
    "we use two methods to study the properties of the 2d - mot . by measuring the fluorescence of the injecting mot",
    ", we obtain a signal which is proportional to the flux of atoms that is produced by the 2d - mot and recaptured by the injecting mot .",
    "even though this quantity is the most important parameter for the next stage of the experiment , it does not allow to characterize the performance of the 2d - mot in a quantitative and independent way .",
    "therefore , to gather more information we perform absorption measurements on the beam of atoms that arrives in the glass cell of the recapturing mot . for this purpose ,",
    "we shine a probe laser beam perpendicular to the atomic beam into the glass cell of the recapturing mot .",
    "the beam is resonant with the @xmath34 transition , has a diameter of 1 mm and is circularly polarized .",
    "a weak magnetic field in the direction of the probe beam ensures that the atoms crossing the probe beam are optically pumped to the outermost zeeman state . by measuring the absorption of the probe beam ,",
    "we obtain the column density of the atomic beam as a function of the probe beam position ( in the direction perpendicular to the atomic beam ) .",
    "information about the velocity distribution of the atoms is obtained by performing time - of - flight measurements .",
    "after suddenly turning off the repumping laser of the 2d - mot , we measure the atomic velocity dispersion by monitoring the absorption of the probe beam as a function of time .",
    "note that this method works since the velocity distribution @xmath35 is on the order the mean velocity @xmath36 and since the distance between the probe beam and the 2d - mot is large compared to the size of the mot . in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the measurement , we dither the frequency of the probe laser at 100 khz and use a lock - in amplifier to measure the absorption .",
    "for the 2d - mot with circular beam profiles described in the previous section , we find that the number @xmath37 of atoms recaptured by the injecting mot increases approximately linearly as a function of the cooling laser power @xmath38 when @xmath38 was varied between 16 mw and 160 mw per beam .",
    "when we reduce the cooling volume of the trap by introducing knife edges which limit the beam size , @xmath37 decreases dramatically in the case where the length of the trap is reduced while it is much less affected if the transverse beam size is reduced .",
    "it has already been observed and explained in @xcite that elliptical beam profiles are advantageous for maximizing the atomic flux . here , instead of using cylindrical lenses to create elliptical beams , we split each of the mot beams into two beams before passing them through the telescopes .",
    "each pair of beams is now passed through the glass cell side to side to each other so as to produce a 2d - mot with elongated beam profiles ( see fig.[setup ] ) .",
    "the laser power of the tapered amplifier can be arbitrarily repartitioned among the four beams , and we find that a maximum of recaptured atoms is observed for a configuration where the intensity of the two beams that are closer to the trap exit is lower than the intensity of the other two beams .",
    "the measurements presented in the following have been performed with this optimized configuration .",
    "absorption measurements of the atomic beam are done at a distance @xmath33 mm from the 2d - mot .",
    "the maximum absorption is on the order of @xmath39 . even though the absorption signal is small , it allows to calibrate those measurements that take advantage of lock - in detection .",
    "the column density profile of the atom beam in fig .",
    "[ profile ] is recorded by scanning the probe beam vertically ( i.  e. , in a direction perpendicular to the atomic beam ) .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of about 10 mm is superior to the diameter @xmath40 of the differential pumping tube so that one might wonder whether the transverse beam size could be limited by the tube .",
    "if the transverse size of the 2d - mot was negligible and the spatial density of the atomic flux was homogeneous at the tube exit , the linear density profile would have the shape of a half circle with diameter @xmath41 mm , giving a fwhm of 10.8 mm . a finite transverse trap size and the velocity - dependence of the beam profile due to gravity",
    "contribute to enlarge the beam size .",
    "the velocity distribution of the atomic beam is obtained by rapidly switching off the repumping beam of the 2d - mot and measuring the time - dependent absorption signal @xmath42 as shown in fig .",
    "[ signal ] .    the atomic flux density per velocity class @xmath43",
    "is related to @xmath42 by @xmath44 after calibrating the signal and integrating over the linear density profile , we obtain the atomic flux density which is shown in fig .  [ fluxdensity ] .",
    "the beam is found to have a mean velocity @xmath45 m / s and a rather large velocity spread @xmath46 m / s .",
    "the highest flux that we have measured was @xmath47 atoms / s .",
    "this number includes atoms with velocities up to 100 m / s .",
    "the experimentally most relevant quantity is the atomic flux that the injecting mot is able to recapture .",
    "the capture velocity that can be achieved strongly depends on the trap geometry as well as the laser power available for the injecting mot and will typically lie in a range between 25 m / s and 40 m / s .",
    "the fraction of atoms with a velocity below 35 m / s is 50% , which corresponds to a useful flux of @xmath48 atoms / s .    in this article",
    ", we have reported on the performance of a 2d - mot similar to the one described in @xcite . in our setup",
    ", we use two adjacent 2d - mot which allows to maximize the atomic flux by redistributing the available laser power among the two traps .",
    "this source has been developed for loading a moving molasses mot which serves to inject a cold and slow atomic beam into a magnetic guide .",
