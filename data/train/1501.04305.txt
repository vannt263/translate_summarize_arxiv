    "photoacoustic tomography ( pat ) is a recently developed non - invasive medical imaging technology whose benefits combine the high contrast of pure optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of pure ultrasound imaging @xcite . in order to speed up the measurement process ,",
    "in this paper we propose a novel compressed sensing approach for pat that uses random combinations of the induced pressure as measurement data .",
    "the proposed strategy yields recovery guarantees and furthermore comes with an efficient numerical implementation allowing high resolution real time imaging .",
    "we thereby focus on a variant of pat using integrating line detectors proposed in @xcite .",
    "our strategy , however , can easily be adapted to more classical pat setups using arrays of point - like detectors .",
    "principle of pat .",
    "a semi - transparent sample is illuminated with a short optical pulse that induces an acoustic pressure wave .",
    "the induced pressure is measured outside of the sample and used to recover an image of the interior . ]",
    "our proposal is based on the main components of compressed sensing , namely randomness and sparsity .",
    "compressed sensing is one of the most influential discoveries in applied mathematics and signal processing of the past decade @xcite . by combining the benefits of data compression and data acquisition",
    "it allows to recover a signal from far fewer linear measurements than suggested by shannon s sampling theorem .",
    "it has led to several new proposed sampling strategies in medical imaging , for example for speeding up mri data acquisition ( see @xcite ) or completing under - sampled ct images  @xcite .",
    "another prominent application of compressed sensing is the single pixel camera ( see @xcite ) that circumvents the use of several expensive high resolution sensors in digital photography .",
    "pat is based on the generation of acoustic waves by illuminating a semi - transparent sample with short optical pulses ( see figure [ fig : pat ] ) . when the sample is illuminated with a short laser pulse ,",
    "parts of the optical energy become absorbed .",
    "due to thermal expansion a subsequent pressure wave is generated depending on the structure of the sample .",
    "the induced pressure waves are recorded outside of the sample and used to recover an image of the interior , see @xcite .",
    "[ ]        in this paper , we consider a special variant of photoacoustic tomography that uses integrating line detectors for recording the pressure waves , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : integratingpat ] , an array of line detectors is arranged around the investigated sample and measures integrals of the pressure wave over a certain number of parallel lines . assuming constant speed of sound , the pressure integrated along the direction of the line detectors satisfies the two dimensional wave equation @xmath0 where the time scaling is chosen in such a way that the speed of sound is normalized to one .",
    "the initial datum @xmath1 in is the two dimensional projection image of the actual , three dimensional initial pressure distribution .",
    "image reconstruction in pat with integrating line detectors can be performed via a two - stage approach @xcite . in the first step the measured pressure values corresponding to values of the solution of outside the support of @xmath1",
    "are used to reconstruct a linear projection ( the initial data in ) of the three dimensional initial pressure distribution .",
    "this procedure is repeated by rotating the array of line detectors around a single axis which yields projection images for several angles . in a second step",
    "these projection images are used to recover the three dimensional initial pressure distribution by inverting the classical radon transform . in this work",
    "we focus on the first problem of reconstructing the ( two dimensional ) initial pressure distribution @xmath1 in .",
    "suppose that the integrating line detectors are arranged on the surface of a circular cylinder of radius @xmath2 , and that the object is located inside that cylinder ( see figure [ fig : integratingpat ] ) .",
    "the data measured by the array of line detectors are then modeled by @xmath3   \\to { \\mathbb{r}}\\ , ,      \\\\ \\label{eq : sampling }      &      z_j      : =   \\begin{pmatrix } \\rho \\cos { \\left(2\\pi(j-1)/n\\right ) } \\\\       \\rho\\sin { \\left(2\\pi(j-1)/n\\right ) }   \\end{pmatrix}\\ , , \\quad \\text { for }   j = 1 , \\dots ,   n    \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the pressure signal corresponding to the @xmath5-th line detector . since the two dimensional initial pressure distribution @xmath1 is supported in a disc of radius @xmath6 and the speed of sound",
    "is constant and normalized to one , no additional information is contained in data @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "this can be seen , for example by exploiting the explicit relations between the two dimensional pressure signals @xmath9 and the spherical means ( compare with subsection  [ sec : sparsifying ] ) of the initial pressure distribution ; see @xcite .    of course , in practice also the functions @xmath10",
    "\\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] have to be represented by discrete samples .",
    "however , temporal samples can easily be collected at a high sampling rate compared to the spatial sampling , where each sample requires a separate sensor .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider the semi - discrete data model .",
    "our compressed pat scheme could easily be adapted to a fully discretized data model .      when using data of the form  , high resolution imaging requires the number @xmath11 of detector locations to be sufficiently large . as the fabrication of an array of parallel line detectors is demanding ,",
    "most experiments using integrating line detectors have been carried out using a single line detector , scanned on circular paths using scanning stages  @xcite .",
    "recently , systems using arrays of @xmath12 parallel line detectors have been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "the most costly building blocks in such devices are the analog to digital converters ( adc ) . for completely parallel readout ,",
    "a separate adc is required for every detector channel . in order to reduce costs , in these practical implementations two to four line detector channels",
    "are multiplexed to one adc . for collecting the complete pressure data , the measurements have to be performed two ( respectively four ) times , because only 32 ( respectively 16 ) of the 64 line measurements can be read out in parallel .",
    "this , again , leads to an increased overall measurement time .",
    "for example , using an excitation laser with a repetition rate of @xmath13{hz}$ ] and two times multiplexing , a measurement time of @xmath14{s}$ ] for a projection image has been reported in  @xcite . without multiplexing",
    ", this measurement time would reduce to the half .    in order to speed up the scanning process and to reduce system costs ,",
    "in this paper we propose a novel compressed sensing approach that allows to perform a smaller number of random measurements with a reduced number of adcs , while retaining high spatial resolution .",
    "for that purpose , instead of collecting individually sampled data @xmath15 as in , we use random combinations @xmath16 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the number of compressed sensing measurements and @xmath18 corresponds to the random set of detector locations contributing to the @xmath19-th measurement . in the reconstruction process the random linear combinations @xmath20 are used to recover the full set of pressure data @xmath21 using compressed sensing techniques . the initial pressure distribution @xmath1 in is subsequently recovered from the completed pressure data by applying standard pat reconstruction algorithms such as time reversal @xcite or filtered backprojection @xcite .    a naive approach for recovering the pressure data from the random measurements",
    "@xmath20 would be to solve for @xmath15 separately for each @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath17 , this is a severely underdetermined system of linear equations and its solution requires appropriate prior knowledge of the unknown parameter vector .",
    "compressed sensing suggests to use the sparsity of the parameter vector in a suitable basis for that purpose .",
    "however , recovery guarantees for zero / one measurements of the type are basis - dependent and require the parameter to be sparse in the standard basis rather than sparsity in a different basis such as orthonormal wavelets ( see subsection [ sec : lossless ] ) .",
    "however , for pressure signals of practical relevance such sparsity assumption in the original basis does not hold .    in this work",
    "we therefore propose a different approach for solving by exploiting special properties of the data in pat .",
    "for that purpose we apply a transformation that acts in the temporal variable only , and makes the transformed pressure values sufficiently sparse in the spatial ( angular ) component . in subsection [ sec : sparsifying ] we present an example of such a transform .",
    "the application of a sparsifying transform to yields linear equations with unknowns being sparse in the angular variable .",
    "it therefore allows to apply sparse recovery results for the zero / one measurements under consideration .",
    "a different compressed sensing approach for pat has been considered in  @xcite . in these articles ,",
    "standard point samples ( such as ) have been used as measurement data and no recovery guarantees have been derived .",
    "further , in @xcite the phantom is directly reconstructed from the incomplete data , whereas we first complete the data using sparse recovery techniques .",
    "our approach is more related to a compressed sensing approach for pat using a planar detector array that has been proposed in  @xcite and also uses random zero / one combinations of pressure values and recovers the complete pressure prior to the actual image reconstruction .",
    "however , in @xcite the sparsifying transform is applied in spatial domain where recovery guarantees are not available as noted above .",
    "we finally notice that our proposal of using a sparsifying temporal transform can easily be extended to planar detector arrays in two or three spatial dimensions ; compare section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : background ]",
    "we review basic results from compressed sensing that we require for our proposal .",
    "we therefore focus on recovery guarantees for zero / one matrices modeled by lossless expanders ; see subsection [ sec : lossless ] . in section  [ sec : cspat ] we present the mathematical framework of the proposed pat compressed sensing scheme .",
    "the sparsity in the spatial variable , required for @xmath23-minimization , is obtained by applying a transformation acting in the temporal variable .",
    "an example of such a transformation is given in subsection  [ sec : sparsifying ] . in section  [ sec : num ] we present numerical results supporting our theoretical investigations .",
    "the paper concludes with a short discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this section we shortly review basic concepts and results of compressed sensing ( sometimes also termed compressive sampling ) .",
    "our main focus will be on recovery results for lossless expanders , which are the basis of our pat compressed sensing scheme .",
    "suppose one wants to sense a high dimensional data vector @xmath24 , such as a digital image .",
    "the classical sampling approach is to measure each component of @xmath25 individually .",
    "hence , in order to collect the whole data vector one has to perform @xmath11 separate measurements , which may be too costly .",
    "on the other hand it is well known and the basis of data compression algorithms , that many datasets are compressible in a suitable basis .",
    "that is , a limited amount of information is sufficient to capture the high dimensional vector @xmath26 .",
    "compressed sensing incorporates this compressibility observation into the sensing mechanism @xcite .",
    "instead of measuring each coefficient of the data vector individually , one collects linear measurements @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the measurement matrix with @xmath17 , and @xmath29 is the measurement vector .",
    "any component of the data vector can be interpreted as a scalar linear measurement performed on the unknown @xmath26 , and the assumption @xmath17 means that far fewer measurements than parameters are available . as @xmath17 , the system is highly underdetermined and can not be uniquely solved ( at least without additional information ) by standard linear algebra .",
    "compressed sensing overcomes this obstacle by utilizing randomness and sparsity .",
    "recall that the vector @xmath30 is called @xmath31-sparse if the support @xmath32 contains at most @xmath31 elements .",
    "results from compressed sensing state that for suitable @xmath33 , any @xmath31-sparse @xmath34 can be found via the optimization problem @xmath35 by relaxing the equality constraint @xmath36 , the optimization problem can be adapted to data which are only approximately sparse and noisy @xcite .",
    "a sufficient condition to guarantee recovery is the so called _ restricted isometry property _ ( rip ) , requiring that for any @xmath31-sparse vector @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 the smallest constant @xmath39 satisfying this inequality is called the @xmath31-restricted isometry constant of @xmath40 and denoted by @xmath41 . under certain conditions on @xmath41 ,",
    "recovery guarantees for sparse and approximately sparse data can be obtained , see for example  @xcite .    while the restricted isometry itself is deterministic , to date all constructions that yield near - optimal embedding dimensions @xmath42 are based on random matrices .",
    "sub - gaussian random matrices satisfy the rip with high probability for an order - optimal embedding dimension @xmath43 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "partial random fourier matrices ( motivated by mri measurements ) and subsampled random convolutions ( motivated by remote sensing ) have been shown to allow for order - optimal embedding dimensions up to logarithmic factors , see  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the sparsity is often not present in the standard basis of @xmath44 , but in a special _ sparsifying _ basis , such as wavelets . for matrices with subgaussian rows",
    "this does not cause a problem , as the rotation invariance of subgaussian vectors ensures that after incorporating an orthogonal transform , the resulting random matrix construction still yields rip matrices with high probability . as a consequence , the sparsifying basis need",
    "not be known for designing the measurement matrix @xmath33 , which is often referred to as universality of such measurements @xcite .",
    "many structured random measurement systems including the partial random fourier and the subsampled random convolution scenarios mentioned above , however , do not exhibit universality .",
    "for example , one can easily see that subsampled fourier measurements can not suffice if the signal is sparse in the fourier basis .",
    "while it has been shown that this problem can be overcome by randomizing the column signs @xcite , such an alteration often can not be implemented in the sensing setup .",
    "another way to address this issue is by requiring incoherence between the measurement basis and the sparsity basis @xcite .",
    "that is , one needs that inner products between vectors of the two bases are uniformly small .",
    "if not all , but most of these inner products are small , one can still recover , provided that one adjusts the sampling distribution accordingly ; this scenario includes the case of fourier measurements and haar wavelet sparse signals @xcite .",
    "incoherence is also the key to recovery guarantees for gradient sparse signals .",
    "namely , many natural images are observed to have an approximately sparse discrete gradient . as a consequence",
    ", it has been argued using a commutation argument that one can recover the signal from uniformly subsampled fourier measurements via minimizing the @xmath23 norm of the discrete gradient , the so - called total variation ( tv ) @xcite .",
    "tv minimization had already proven to be a favorable method in image processing , see , for example @xcite .",
    "a problem with this approach is that the compressed sensing recovery guarantees then imply good recovery of the gradient , not of the signal itself .",
    "small errors in the gradient , however , can correspond to substantial errors in the signal , which is why this approach can only work if no noise is present . a refined analysis that allows for noisy measurements",
    "requires the incoherence of the measurement basis to the haar wavelet basis @xcite .",
    "again , tv minimization is considered for recovery . by adjusting the sampling distribution ,",
    "these results have also been shown to extend to fourier measurements and other systems with only most measurement vectors incoherent to the haar basis @xcite .",
    "for the measurement matrices considered in this work , namely zero / one matrices based on expander graphs , recovery guarantees build on an @xmath23-version of the restricted isometry property , namely one requires that @xmath45 for all sufficiently sparse @xmath26 and some constant @xmath46 ; see @xcite and subsection  [ sec : lossless ] below . as the @xmath23-norm is not rotation invariant",
    ", basis transformations typically destroy this property .",
    "that is , not even incoherence based recovery guarantees are available ; recovery results only hold in the standard basis .",
    "thus an important aspect of our work will be to ensure ( approximate ) sparsity in the standard basis .",
    "this will be achieved by applying a particular transformation in the time variable .",
    "recall that we seek recovery guarantees for a measurement setup , where each detector is switched on exactly @xmath47 out of @xmath42 times .",
    "that is , one obtains a binary measurement matrix @xmath48 with exactly @xmath47 ones in each column .",
    "it therefore can be interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a left @xmath47-regular bipartite graph . under certain additional conditions ,",
    "such a bipartite graph is a lossless expander ( see definition  [ def : expander ] ) which , as we will see , guarantees stable recovery of sparse vectors .",
    "expander graphs have been used since the 1970s in theoretical computer science , originating in switching theory from modeling networks connecting many users , cf .",
    "@xcite for further applications .",
    "they have also been useful in measure theory , where it was possible to solve the banach - ruziewicz problem using tools from the construction of expander graphs , see  @xcite for a detailed examination of this connection . for a survey on expander graphs and their applications ,",
    "see for example  @xcite .    compressed sensing with expander graphs has been considered in  @xcite , where also several efficient algorithms for the solution of compressed sensing problems using expander graphs have been proposed .",
    "a short review of sparse recovery algorithms using expander like matrices is given in  @xcite .",
    "in this subsection we recall main compressed sensing results using lossless expanders as presented in the recent monograph @xcite , where the proofs of all mentioned theorems can be found in section  13 .     of a left @xmath47-regular bipartite graph with @xmath49",

    "section [ sec : background ] above ) , however , we can not expect sparsity in the original domain .",
