    "there is a wealth of results on nonlinear diffusion equations of the kind @xmath2 as the monumental monograph by vazquez  @xcite for the porous medium equation , @xmath3 , demonstrates .",
    "recently , bodineau , lebowitz , mouhot and villani  @xcite studied drift - driven nonlinear diffusion equations with inhomogeneous dirichlet data and established the existence of lyapunov functionals for such equations .    starting with the work of jordan , kinderlehrer and otto  @xcite ,",
    "diffusion equations have been written as gradient flow of the entropy .",
    "for the example of linear diffusion , @xmath4 , with the boltzmann entropy density @xmath5 , it is immediate that @xmath6 .",
    "the seminal insight of  @xcite is that the operator involved , @xmath7 , is associated to a metric and hence defines a geometry ; the evolution is then determined by the steepest descent of the entropy @xmath8 in this associated geometry .",
    "here @xmath8 is the classic entropy given by @xmath9 if @xmath10 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure and @xmath11 if @xmath10 is not absolutely continuous .",
    "more generally , gradient flows are formally equations of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath8 is a functional defined on the state space , @xmath13 the frchet differential and @xmath14 an operator from the cotangent space to the tangent , the so - called onsager operator . this formulation says more than that @xmath8 is a lyapunov functional ; it says the evolution is given by the steepest descent evolution of @xmath8 in the geometry given by @xmath15 .    in this short note",
    ", we ask a simple question : for equation  , with a suitable choice of @xmath1 , can one show that an associate lyapunov functional is in fact a thermodynamic entropy , that is , the entropy associated with an underlying particle system ?",
    "this requires that   is the hydrodynamic limit of the underlying particle system .",
    "furthermore , we will then write   as formal gradient flow ( steepest descent ) of the entropy , in a metric we derive as the metric associated with the thermodynamic entropy",
    ". we thus call this metric ( or geometry ) the thermodynamic metric ( or geometry ) . in some cases ,",
    "the formal setting can be shown to define rigorously a gradient flow .",
    "we employ basic tools , techniques and results from statistical mechanics and optimal transport . yet",
    ", the result seems interesting in a twofold way .",
    "firstly , from the statistical mechanics perspective , the thermodynamic entropy is well known ( see , e.g. , grosskinsky  @xcite ) , but has not been placed in a gradient flow context , i.e. , linked to the associated thermodynamic metric .",
    "secondly , the nonlinear diffusion @xmath16 has been studied in a classic wasserstein setting , with the @xmath17-wasserstein metric  @xcite , and has been shown to be the gradient flow , with respect to the @xmath17-wasserstein metric , of the free energy @xmath18 given by @xmath19 here @xmath20 is characterised by the ordinary differential equation @xmath21 and assumed to satisfy @xmath22 ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 11.2.5 ) for less restrictive assumptions ) .",
    "this gradient flow setting is different from the setting presented in this article .",
    "it is well known that one equation can have different incarnations as gradient flow , that is , as steepest descent of a functional in a metric space ; linear diffusion is a classic example with infinitely many such formulations . then the functional is a lyapunov functional . here",
    "we show that in the setting of this article , the lyapunov function has a thermodynamic interpretation , being the thermodynamic entropy of the so - called zero range process .",
    "we point out that the existence theory can be established without this thermodynamic interpretation . that is , the knowledge of lyapunov functionals , which may or may not be entropies , can be key to a successful existence theory , as  @xcite testifies . at the same time",
    ", large deviation theory singles out one particular metric in the cases under consideration .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : connection - to - large ] that this gives , at least formally , immediately rise to a variational scheme of jordan - kinderlehrer - otto ( jko ) type  @xcite .",
    "we remark that different particle processes can lead to the same equation as hydrodynamic limit , but that equation will then typically have different representations as pairs of metric and entropy .",
    "for example , the symmetric exclusion process and a system of independent random walks both lead to the linear diffusion equation , but with two different entropies and correspondingly two different metrics , see  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in the setting of this article , the same pair of a weighted wasserstein metric and the thermodynamic entropy arises both from large deviation theory and a weighted version of the classical benamou - brenier formula .",
    "the weighted wasserstein metric is ( formally ) conformally equivalent to the classical one , with the weight being related to the diffusion of a tagged particle .",
    "namely , it is often convenient to write   as @xmath23 since @xmath24 will be related to the diffusivity of a tagged particle in the underlying zero range process , as discussed in subsection  [ sec : asympt - behav - tagg ] .",
    "roughly speaking , the equation which is the hydrodynamic limit of the zero range process looks like the kolmogorov equation of a single tagged particle .",
    "this diffusivity ( sometimes called _ self - diffusion coefficient _ ) will turn out to be closely related to the _ thermodynamic metric _ of the process discussed below .",
    "[ [ plan - of - the - paper ] ] plan of the paper + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we focus on the so - called zero - range process as underlying microscopic model ; this process and its properties are described in section  [ sec : particle - models ] . in particular , the entropy ( density ) @xmath25 is identified there ; in section  [ sec : therm - form - nonl ] the associated metric is determined .",
    "we show that this metric can also be obtained differently , by a large deviation argument ; this is the content of section  [ sec : connection - to - large ] , which also sketches connections to associated models of fluctuating hydrodynamics .",
    "in this subsection , we briefly summarise the zero range process on a flat torus ; see  @xcite for more information on zero range process and the condensation phenomenon they exhibit for particular choices of jump rates .",

    "a particle at a given site @xmath27 interacts only with the particles located at the same site ( hence zero range ) . specifically , the rate at which one particle leaves a site @xmath28 depends only on the total number of particles at site @xmath28 , described by the ( local ) _ jump rate function _",

    "the microscopic stochastic dynamics defined by this generator can be described as follows .",
    "starting from an initial configuration @xmath52 , the system waits an exponential time @xmath53 with rate @xmath54 , at which time one particle is moved from @xmath28 to @xmath50 with probability @xmath55 .",

    "conversely , for @xmath68 in the proper domain @xmath70 , the translation invariant product measure @xmath71 in @xmath46 with one - site marginal @xmath72 is an equilibrium state of the zero range process .",
    "consequently the family of the translation invariant and product equilibrium states of the zero range process is @xmath73 . from a statistical mechanics point of view",
    ", this family is the grand canonical ensemble . of course",
    ", in order for non - trivial equilibrium states to exist , the critical fugacity @xmath74{g!(k)}\\ ] ] must be strictly positive to ensure that the partition function @xmath75 has non - trivial radius of convergence .    for the description of the evolution of the empirical density of the zero range process",
    ", it is useful to have a reparametrisation of the grand canonical ensemble by the density .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing the _ density function _",

    "the remaining quadratic term is for small time intervals formally of lower order .",
    "thus in summary , an expansion of the large deviation rate functional   for nonlinear diffusion associated with the zero range process yields a variational formulation of jordan - otto - kinderlehrer type , with the metric being the weighted wasserstein metric considered in this article , and the functional being the thermodynamic entropy .",
    "the previous subsection  [ sec : large - devi - theory ] showed that the thermodynamic metric is related not only to the limit equation , but also to the probability of deviations from it . at least at a formal level , this connection is even stronger , as we now explain .",
    "formally , the metric is given by a symmetric linear operator , which has an inverse that can be interpreted as covariance matrix .",
    "if we add a suitable space - time noise to the limit partial differential equation , then it formally has not only the same large deviations rate functionals , but finite moments of the fluctuations ( that is , the difference between stochastic process and deterministic limit ) converge to the same process as for the original particle model .",
    "this is now explained in more detail .",
    "consider the equations @xmath292 where @xmath293 is space - time white noise .",
    "we point out that the stochastic pde ( spde )   is not expected to have strong ( i.e. , pathwise ) solutions . to our knowledge ,",
    "the suitable notion of generalised solutions is an open problem .",
    "consider , however , the fluctuations , i.e. , the differences between solutions of   and the deterministic pde  , re - scaled with the scaling of the central limit theorem . as @xmath294 is small , we can linearise around @xmath295 and obtain formally that a limit ( in law ) @xmath296 of @xmath297 should solve the _ linear _ spde @xmath298 i.e. , it is an ornstein - uhlenbeck process . here",
    "@xmath299 is the _ self - diffusion _ coefficient of the zero range process , while @xmath148 is the _ bulk - diffusion _ coefficient .",
    "this convergence statement for the fluctuations can be stated in the following weaker form .",
    "consider for smooth @xmath300 the process @xmath301 then by  , an application of ito s formula ( see , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4.5 ) ) , and the ( formal ) limit @xmath302 we get for any smooth @xmath303 that @xmath304 is a _ martingale_.    note that in the last term , the expression @xmath305 can be written as @xmath306 , which implies that the large deviations should be related to the metric with the inverse operator , i.e. , @xmath307 , as found in the previous subsection .",
    "we now relate the martingale   to the zero range process .",
    "we consider the empirical measure of the zero range process , i.e. , for smooth @xmath308 @xmath309 and the fluctuations @xmath310 it can be shown  @xcite for a large class of zero range processes that for any smooth test function , @xmath311 converge to a solution of the martingale problem  .",
    "in other words , the limit of the fluctuations of the zero range process is in law equal to those of the spde  .",
    "this can be seen as justification of the complicated noise term in  ; precisely this noise term is related to fluctuations of the zero range process via the martingale expression  .",
    "we remark that   is of fluctuating hydrodynamics type . in the linear case",
    "@xmath312 , the multiplicative conservative noise in   has been derived by dean  @xcite , and using quite different lines of arguments by sturm and von renesse  @xcite ; the link between the noise and the geometry has been explained by a formal large deviation argument  @xcite .",
    "while the discussion in this paper is limited to a sub - class of zero range processes , it therefore does not cover all nonlinearities @xmath87 but only those that occur as hydrodynamic limit of such a process .",
    "yet , we remark that a solution of for a certain range of @xmath223 would formally yield a stochastic process whose hydrodynamic limit is a gradient flow of the entropy defined by with respect to the weighted wasserstein metric , and whose large deviation rate functional is as in subsection  [ sec : large - devi - theory ] .",
