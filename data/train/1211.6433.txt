    "* ) . on one hand , molecular cloud turbulence ",
    "because it is supersonic  compresses interstellar gas in shocks and filaments . if a critical amount of mass is swept up in a local compression , that gas can become gravitationally unstable and collapse , giving birth to new stars . on the other hand , turbulence and magnetic fields together carry about the same amount of energy as there is in gravitational binding energy in a whole molecular cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , both turbulence and magnetic fields provide large - scale support against global cloud collapse .",
    "that support is needed , because otherwise molecular clouds would simply collapse as a whole , which is not observed @xcite .",
    "the role of gravity and magnetic pressure is unidirectional : gravity always acts to promote collapse , while magnetic pressure always counteracts collapse .",
    "the role of turbulence on the other hand is dual : it provides global support , but at the same time produces local compression  the seeds for stellar birth .",
    "hence , turbulence , gravity , and magnetic fields are crucial for our understanding of star formation .",
    "these three physical effects are likely the major players in controlling the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the milky way and potentially in other galaxies , as discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "there , we compared theoretical and numerical models of the sfr with observations of galactic clouds , finding very good agreement for a wide range of physical parameters , including extreme cases of turbulent forcing ( solenoidal versus compressive forcing of the turbulence ) , sonic mach numbers between 3 and 50 , and magnetic fields ranging from the super - alfvnic to the trans - alfvnic regime , all in the range of parameters observed in real molecular clouds .    despite this large variety of physical parameters ,",
    "the conversion of gas into stars is always quite inefficient in molecular clouds , with sfes of typically only a few percent @xcite .",
    "however , it is still poorly understood why this is the case .",
    "it is the aim of this study to shed light on this subject by providing a detailed analysis of the sfe in the simulations of paper i , and comparing them to observations of galactic clouds .",
    "the sfe of clouds is often uncertain or unknown . the main difficulty in estimating the sfe lies in obtaining a clear census of ysos , in particular in dense and confused regions where many protostellar disks are embedded and closely packed , such that the yso population is often underestimated in observations .",
    "there is some indication that the sfe ranges from less than 1% up to 50% in most clouds , depending on the particular cloud studied , its physical parameters , the actual subregion considered inside that cloud , and the evolutionary stage of that region .",
    "this is a very wide range of sfes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to advance our understanding of the physical processes that determine this range and provide measures to constrain the sfe for a particular cloud region observed .",
    "for instance , considered as a whole , giant molecular clouds typically only convert at most a few percent of their gas into stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , when looking at regions of dense core and cluster formation , observers find higher sfes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , eventually approaching the local efficiency @xmath13 on scales of individual protostellar cores . this local efficiency @xmath13 determines the gas fraction of a single protostellar accretion envelope that actually ends up on the protostar(s ) forming in a dense core",
    "although gas is efficiently falling onto the protostar , jets , winds and outflows launched from the protostellar disk counteract the inflow , thereby limiting accretion such that @xmath14 .",
    "we estimated this local efficiency with by comparing our simulations with galactic observations by @xcite in paper i. it is thus plausible that the sfe naturally approaches the local efficiency @xmath13 on sufficiently small scales , when a single , dense , star - forming core is considered .    here",
    ", we investigate the dependence of the sfe on molecular cloud scales and on physical parameters , such as the driving of turbulence , the sonic and alfvn mach numbers , and the virial parameter of a cloud .",
    "first , we study the structure of the column density and how it changes with @xmath12 in section  [ sec : morphology ] .",
    "we then discuss the dependences of the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of the volumetric and column densities in section  [ sec : pdfs ] .",
    "we find that the pdfs depend on the forcing of the turbulence and on the sonic and alfvn mach numbers .",
    "the pdfs develop power - law tails of flatting slope in all our numerical models when star formation proceeds , as seen in observations of clouds @xcite , suggesting that the pdf can be used to infer the sfe . in section  [ sec :",
    "scaling ] , however , we find that a more reliable and independent distinction between star - forming and quiescent clouds is possible by studying the spatial scaling of column density with fourier or @xmath4-variance analyses @xcite , i.e. , by studying the density ",
    "size scaling in molecular clouds .",
    "we extend this qualitative discriminator of star formation to a quantitative method for estimating the sfe in section  [ sec : estimatingsfe ] , by measuring how the slope @xmath2 of the density power spectrum changes with @xmath12 , depending on the forcing of turbulence , the sonic mach number , and the magnetic field . inverting this relation yields a function @xmath15 , which can be used to estimate @xmath12 from a measurement of @xmath2 in a dust or integrated molecular line map .",
    "the advantage of this new method is that no a priori knowledge of star formation activity or yso counts is required to estimate sfe . in section  [ sec : obs ] we apply this method to observations and compare inferred sfes with independent estimates , indicating good agreement . in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] , we discuss uncertainties and limitations of the new method .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our numerical simulation techniques are explained in detail in paper i. here we only give a brief overview of the most important aspects of the simulation methodology and provide a complete list of simulation parameters as in paper i.    we use the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) code flash v2.5 @xcite to model isothermal , self - gravitating , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence on three - dimensional ( 3d ) , periodic grids with resolutions of @xmath16@xmath17 grid points .",
    "these are all uniform - grid simulations , except for one @xmath18 simulation , where we use a root grid with @xmath19 cells and one level of amr with a refinement criterion to ensure that the local jeans lengths is covered with at least 32 grid cells , in order to resolve turbulent vorticity and magnetic - field amplification on the jeans scale @xcite . for solving the mhd equations",
    ", we use the hll3r positive - definite riemann solver @xcite .",
    "the mhd equations are closed with an isothermal equation of state , which is a reasonable approximation for dense , molecular gas of solar metallicity , over a wide range of densities @xcite .",
    "the self - gravity of the gas is computed with a multi - grid poisson solver ( see * ? ? ?",
    "to drive turbulence in the simulations , we apply a stochastic acceleration field @xmath20 as a momentum and energy source term .",
    "@xmath20 only contains large - scale modes , @xmath21 , where most of the power is injected at the @xmath22 mode in fourier space , which corresponds to half of the box size @xmath23 in physical space .",
    "we thus model turbulent forcing on large scales , as favored by molecular cloud observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "smaller scales , @xmath24 , are not affected directly by the forcing , such that turbulence can develop self - consistently there .",
    "we use the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process to model @xmath20 , which is a well - defined stochastic process with a finite autocorrelation timescale @xcite .",
    "we set the autocorrelation time equal to the turbulent crossing time on the largest scales of the system , @xmath25 , with the rms sonic mach number @xmath26 and the constant sound speed @xmath27 , leading to a smoothly varying stochastic forcing in space and time ( for details , see * ? ? ?",

    "* paper i ) .",
    "we can adjust the mixture of solenoidal and compressive modes of our turbulent forcing , by applying a projection in fourier space .",
    "here we compare simulations with solenoidal forcing ( @xmath28 ) and compressive forcing ( @xmath29 ) , as well as an intermediate mixture of both .",
    "solenoidal and compressive forcing are extreme cases , while in real molecular clouds we expect some mixture with a range of possible ratios between solenoidal and compressive modes ( see the discussion of physical drivers of turbulence and their mode characteristics in paper i ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite describe a scenario in which the observed alignment of young protostars in the @xmath30 ophiuchi central region could have been triggered by a shock compression , induced by a supernova / wind shell and/or expanding @xmath31 regions from nearby ob associations .",
    "such expanding shells are compressive forcing mechanisms , because they primarily excite compressible velocity modes .      in order to model collapse and accretion ,",
    "we use an advanced amr - based approach for sink particles , in which only bound and collapsing gas is accreted ( for a detailed analysis , see * ? ? ?",
    "the key feature of this approach is to define a control volume centered on grid cells exceeding a density threshold .",
    "@xcite found that the jeans length must be resolved with at least 4 grid cells to avoid artificial fragmentation , leading to a resolution - dependent density threshold criterion for triggering sink particle creation checks , @xmath32 where the sink particle accretion radius @xmath33 is set to 2.5 grid - cell lengths at the maximum level of refinement , corresponding to half a jeans length at @xmath34 .",
    "this guarantees that the jeans length is still resolved with 5 grid cells prior to potential sink particle creation to avoid artificial fragmentation .",
    "grid cells exceeding the density threshold given by equation  ( [ eq : rhosink ] ) , however , do not form sink particles right away .",
    "first , a spherical control volume with radius @xmath33 is defined around the cell exceeding @xmath34 , in which a series of checks for gravitational instability and collapse are performed .",
    "if all checks are passed , a sink particle is created in the center of the control volume .",
    "this procedure avoids spurious sink particle formation , and allows us to trace only truly collapsing and star - forming gas .",
    "once a sink particle is created , it can gain mass by accreting gas from the amr grid , but only if this gas exceeds the threshold density , is inside the sink particle accretion radius , is bound to the particle , and is collapsing toward it . if all these criteria are fulfilled , the excess mass above the density threshold defined by equation  ( [ eq : rhosink ] ) is removed from the mhd system and added to the sink particle , such that mass , momentum and angular momentum are conserved by construction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "sink particle gravity is computed by direct @xmath35-body summation over all sink particles and grid cells .",
    "we use a second - order accurate leapfrog integrator to advance the sink particles on a timestep that allows us to resolve close and highly eccentric orbits of sink particles without introducing significant errors on super - resolution grid scales , as tested in @xcite .

    "the upper and lower limits of the sfe quoted in the last column were estimated based on comparing the range of spectral slopes @xmath2 ( including the maximum uncertainties in equation  [ eq : fitinverse ] combined with the additional fit uncertainties for @xmath2 from the observations ; see discussion in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] ) with the numerical simulations in figure  [ fig : slopes ] , covering a wide range of physical conditions ( with solenoidal and compressive forcing , and different magnetic field strengths ) .",

    "is from a fourier analysis of the @xmath36 line of atomic hydrogen of the high galactic latitude ursa major ` cirrus ' by @xcite .",
    "they find a spectral slope @xmath37 .",
    "comparing this value , including the uncertainties in both simulations ( figure  [ fig : slopes ] and equation  [ eq : fitinverse ] ) and observations ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) , we estimate that the ursa major cirrus has an @xmath7 .",
    "this is because even the maximum slope , @xmath38 is significantly negative and any of our numerical simulations did not produce stars for @xmath39 . although molecular condensations have been detected in the ursa major cirrus , it appears to have essentially no star formation activity , likely because of the high virial parameters estimated for this cloud @xcite .",
    "this is in good agreement with our findings of @xmath7 , based on the comparison of the observed slope @xmath2 with our numerical simulations .",
    "entries 25 , 7 , and 12 in table  [ tab : obs ] are for observations of the polaris flare by @xcite and @xcite with different instruments ( iram , kosma , fcrao , cfa ) and different molecular transitions of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we see some variation of the derived slope @xmath42 to @xmath43 , depending on the telescope and tracer used , as well as on the spatial scales over which the slope was determined @xcite .",
    "thus , we reanalyzed the @xmath4-variance data in @xcite , fitting average power laws over a wider range of scales than considered in @xcite , in order to obtain a rough estimate of the slope @xmath2 , less affected by the particular choice of scales for the fit .",
    "we find that our reanalysis mostly agrees with the estimates of @xmath2 in @xcite .",
    "we see that the overall slope @xmath2 in the polaris flare is of order @xmath44 , from which we estimate @xmath7 based on the model fits of figure  [ fig : slopes ] and equation  ( [ eq : fitinverse ] ) in the polaris flare , with a formal upper limit of @xmath45 .",
    "this is in good agreement with observations of the polaris flare , showing no sign of star formation activity , although the saxophone region does seem to indicate some trace of gravitational contraction ( n.  schneider 2012 , private communication ) , which , however , has not led to any star formation in the cloud yet .",

    "the values of @xmath46 to @xmath47 were estimated based on average fits to the @xmath4-variance plots in @xcite and @xcite , taking into account a broad range of scales and all the error bars of those analyses .",
    "the purpose of our reanalysis is to obtain general trends of the slope @xmath2 , without constraining the fits to relatively small scales as done in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is why we find slightly different slopes here compared to their small - scale fits .",
    "these values of @xmath2 indicate @xmath7 with an upper limit of @xmath48 in vela and ngc 1333 , and @xmath45 in coalsack .",
    "the latter is in agreement with an independent estimate of star formation activity in coalsack , suggesting relatively low sfe @xcite .",
    "estimates of @xmath2 for the following clouds and cloud regions ( entries 10 , 11 , and 1324 ) range from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , suggesting sfes in the range @xmath7 to a maximum of 6% , when comparing to the range of sfes obtained in the simulations for such @xmath2 ( see figure  [ fig : slopes ] , equation  [ eq : fitinverse ] , and table  [ tab : fits ] ) .",
    "those clouds include lupus , rosette , pipe , corona australis , and perseus , which indeed seem to be consistent with low to moderate star formation activity ( compare , e.g. , table  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "a notable exception may seem orion a+b , which contain a large number of ysos , indicating high star formation activity .",
    "in a recent survey of orion a+b , @xcite indeed detected 3479 ysos .",
    "however , orion a+b are also quite massive with @xmath51 @xcite . assuming that ysos produce stars with a mean mass of about @xmath52 ( which is in between the mean masses of the present - day stellar mass function , @xmath53 , and the initial mass function , @xmath54 , for disk galaxies ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can estimate the sfe of orion a+b with @xmath55 .",
    "a similar estimate based on yso counts and assuming a median mass for each yso of @xmath56 is provided in @xcite . from their table  2 , we can compute @xmath57 with an assumed star formation timescale @xmath58 @xcite . using the values quoted for the low extinction threshold , @xmath59 , covering almost the whole cloud ,",
    "we obtain @xmath60 for orion a and @xmath61 for orion b , consistent with our own estimate above .",
    "those sfes obtained from yso counts , however , are likely lower limits , because of the limited detectability of ysos on small spatial scales in crowed , dense regions . the yso completeness achieved with _ spitzer _ may only be 50% averaged over the inner @xmath62 of the trapezium region in orion , and only 30% within a radius of @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "thus , sfe estimates based on yso counts can be quite uncertain .",
    "however , they do fall in the range that we obtain for orion a+b by using the slope @xmath2 listed in table  [ tab : obs ] . thus , even if no information on ysos is available for a given cloud , we can still get a lower and upper limit of the sfe from the slope @xmath2 , which is directly measurable from the column density map of a cloud alone .",
    "taurus , w3 , and chamaeleon ( entries 2527 ) all have @xmath64 , indicating .",
    "for instance , taurus has a total molecular mass of about @xmath65 @xcite , and more than 300 ysos were detected ( see table  1 in * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar to our estimate for orion a+b above , we find @xmath66 .",
    "another estimate based on yso counts in @xcite yields @xmath67 ( again using their low extinction threshold value to define @xmath68 ) . both are consistent with our formal upper limit of @xmath69 from @xmath2 , but significantly smaller than the mean , @xmath70 .",
    "taurus is indeed somewhat special , in that it may be more dominated by magnetic fields than other clouds .",
    "recent observations suggest that turbulence in taurus is trans - alfvnic @xcite , leading to lower sfrs than in super - alfvnic clouds ( see paper i ) .",
    "the rather low sfe in taurus may thus be a result of the relatively strong magnetic fields there .",
    "our estimate of from the slope @xmath2 is slightly biased toward larger values of @xmath12 , because stronger magnetic fields also produce slightly larger @xmath2 ( see figure  [ fig : slopes ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "cloud region 28 in table  [ tab : obs ] is a @xmath4-variance measurement by @xcite of the cygnus x giant molecular cloud from a high - resolution @xmath41 integrated intensity map .",
    "cygnus x is one of the most massive and most active star - forming regions in the galaxy , including both old and young populations of stars @xcite . on well - resolved scales , between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we find a power - law slope @xmath73 from figure  2 in @xcite .",
    "comparing this slope to our simulation models in figure  [ fig : slopes ] , we estimate that cygnus x has an sfe in the range",
    ". the lower limit of the @xmath12 is formally obtained from the lower limit of @xmath2 , while we actually know that cygnus x is forming stars , so @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , the massive dr21 filament in cygnus x shows signs of infall @xcite , which is likely the reason for cygnus x exhibiting a slightly positive @xmath2 on length scales representative of that filament ( length @xmath74 , width @xmath75 ) and sub - filaments collapsing toward the main filament @xcite .",
    "the range found for cygnus x is relatively large , but  to the best of our knowledge  the only currently available estimate of the @xmath12 for the whole cygnus x giant molecular cloud complex .    finally , @xcite studied the @xmath4-variance spectrum of the serpens core observed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated a slope @xmath76 , which is clearly positive and larger than any of the previous cloud regions studied , indicating @xmath77 ( last entry in table  [ tab : obs ] ) . based on the total available gas mass and the mass spectrum of condensations reported in @xcite , we estimate an independent lower limit of the sfe in the serpens core of @xmath78 .",
    "recently , @xcite reported in serpens south and w40 .",
    "another independent estimate by @xcite suggests an in the region where most protostellar cores and protostars are located .",
    "all independent estimates agree with the lower limit , @xmath77 , that we find here based on @xmath2 .",
    "it is indeed plausible that the serpens core region has a relatively high @xmath12 , because  unlike the large - scale cloud regions studied above  the serpens core is a small - scale , high - density region , where eventually we expect a relatively large fraction of the gas to be accreted by stars .",
    "the serpens core region is close to the limit where the @xmath12 approaches the local efficiency @xmath79 , i.e. , the mass fraction of gas of an individual dense core that will actually fall onto the protostar .",
    "theoretical , numerical , and observational estimates suggest that @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite find and @xcite find .",
    "comparing the sfr and gas column densities in our numerical simulations with galactic observations by @xcite in paper i , we found best - fit values , which seem to suggest typical local efficiencies of @xmath80 , in good agreement with the aforementioned independent estimates .",
    "thus , about half of the gas in a dense core is accreted by the protostar , while the other half remains in the envelope or is driven out of the core by winds , jets , and outflows .",
    "in section  [ sec : estimatingsfe ] we calibrated a simple , empirical relation given by equation  ( [ eq : fitinverse ] ) between the spectral slope @xmath2 of the column density and the @xmath12 in the numerical simulations of section  [ sec : sims ] .",
    "this relation can be applied to observational maps in which @xmath2 can be measured with fourier techniques such as the @xmath4-variance method , to obtain an estimate of the @xmath12 in the observed region .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : fitinverse ] ) only includes an uncertainty in @xmath81 as suggested by our calibration with numerical simulations .",
    "the practical uncertainties in @xmath2 when measured in an observational map , however , can be higher than that .",
    "such uncertainties include finite telescope resolution , signal - to - noise , and sensitivity limits for a given observational tracer of column density .",
    "for instance , dust emission , extinction , or molecular line emission all suffer from sensitivity limits in both the high and low column - density regimes ( e.g. , molecular lines become optically thick at high column density or detectors are simply not sensitive enough to trace very low column density ) .",
    "such statistical and systematic uncertainties are not included in equation  ( [ eq : fitinverse ] ) and must be added accordingly .",
    "a primary goal of this paper is to understand the transition from the global @xmath12 on large scales ( e.g. , a whole molecular cloud ) to the local core formation efficiency @xmath13 .",
    "the latter denotes the fraction of gas in a dense core that eventually goes into the star .",
    "this is not 100% , because some fraction , @xmath82 , of the gas in the core does not fall onto the protostar , but is driven out of the core by outflows , winds , and/or jets during the formation of the protostar in the center of the accretion disk . without specifying what mechanisms ( e.g. , radiative and/or magnetic ) cause the gas flow out of the core or how it actually happens , we simply note that we expect a local efficiency ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i , and references therein ) .",
    "however , even the best high - resolution observations of individual cores are just beginning to investigate this local regime of star formation and constrain @xmath13 . in surveys of structure and star formation activity of molecular clouds on intermediate and large scales ,",
    "such cores appear as sites of high column density , but their internal structure is often not resolved .",
    "thus , the actual amount of gas contributing to star formation is uncertain and so is the actual total @xmath12 .",
    "we note that we did not take into account the local efficiency @xmath13 in equation  ( [ eq : fitinverse ] ) , because the simulations did not include any form of feedback such as winds , jets , or outflows from the protostellar objects .",
    "such feedback effects are not accounted for and hence add to the uncertainty in the true @xmath12 when equation  ( [ eq : fitinverse ] ) is applied to observational data .",
    "given the local efficiencies , it would seem reasonable to adjust the inferred sfe via equation  ( [ eq : fitinverse ] ) down by the factor @xmath13 to estimate the actual total sfe of a cloud . in the application of equation  ( [ eq : fitinverse ] ) to the observations presented in section  [ sec : obs",
    "] , however , we did not make such an adjustment , because we think that the same adjustment would be necessary in the case of yso counts to infer the sfe .",
    "this is because the effect of the local efficiency @xmath13 is typically also not accounted for when estimating the typical mass of a yso , since those observations are limited in resolution and likely include a significant fraction of gas / dust in the core that may not all be accreted by the star .",
    "thus , the local efficiency @xmath13 due to feedback introduces uncertainties as discussed above , which , however , similarly apply to sfe estimates obtained with yso counts .",
    "we furthermore note that the simulations studied here are highly idealized and can suffer from resolution issues . however , the effects of limited resolution are relatively small for our measurement of @xmath2 and we do understand them quite well ( see appendix  [ app : spectres ] ) . a more severe issue is the choice of boundary conditions in the simulations .",
    "they are periodic in all directions .",
    "we discuss the limitations of this and related , different approaches to treat boundaries in paper i. for the present study of the sfe , the main limitation lies in the fact that our computational boxes are closed , so there is no gas inflow or outflow .",
    "real molecular clouds are not isolated , closed objects , but exchange mass with the medium in which they are embedded .",
    "this poses a general problem and uncertainty in defining the @xmath12 .",
    "imagine , for instance , a cloud accreting more gas from the outside than is turned into stars inside in the same amount of time .",
    "in that case , the @xmath12 would go down , even though stars form continuously , simply because the total gas content in the region of interest increases due to accretion from the outside .",
    "an even more remarkable thought experiment is one in which star formation has stopped at a given @xmath12 in a given volume , and suppose the stars formed in that region now blow away all the remaining gas in their surrounding and drive it out of that volume ( e.g. , by driving winds ) . according to the standard definition of the @xmath12 in equation  ( [ eq : sfe ] )",
    ", @xmath83 would remain the same in this process , but @xmath84 would go down , leading to an increasing @xmath12 , even though no more stars form .",
    "this is an example emphasizing that one must be quite careful with interpreting sfes in open systems .",
    "such definitions of the @xmath12 in open systems are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we studied the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) in simulations of supersonic , self - gravitating , magnetized turbulence . in paper",
    "i , we found that the simulations yield star formation rates ( sfrs ) varying by orders of magnitude , depending on the virial parameter , on the forcing of the turbulence , and on the sonic and alfvn mach numbers , consistent with observed sfr column densities . here , we focused on the sfe and find that the density and column density distributions change significantly when star formation occurs and when the sfe increases .",
    "we find that the column density scaling is particularly sensitive to the sfe , enabling us to estimate the sfe from column density observations , without requiring a priori information on star formation activity or yso counts .",
    "more detailed results are listed in the following .    1 .",
    "we find that star formation affects the column density structure of clouds ( see figures  [ fig : imagessol ] and  [ fig : imagescomp ] ) .",
    "the effect of star formation on the global structure is stronger in low mach number clouds and for clouds with solenoidal forcing than for clouds with high mach number and/or compressive forcing , because strong turbulence alone produces high - density filaments , without requiring gravitational contraction .",
    "2 .   the volumetric and column density pdfs become wider with increasing mach number and more compressive forcing ( see figures  [ fig : pdfs ] and  [ fig : coldenspdfs ] ) .",
    "in contrast , increasing the magnetic field strength yields smaller standard deviations of the pdf ( see figure  [ fig : magpdfs ] ) , as expected from equation  ( [ eq : sigs ] ) .",
    "3 .   the pdfs of our simulations with extremely different forcing , sonic mach number , and magnetic field strengths , all develop power - law tails of flattening slope with increasing sfe .",
    "we find that the high - density tails of the pdfs are consistent with equivalent radial density profiles , @xmath0 with depending on @xmath12 , consistent with column density observations @xcite .",
    "4 .   the velocity spectra from our simulations with different forcing , sonic mach number , and magnetic field are all consistent with the scaling inferred in molecular cloud observations , @xcite , suggesting highly compressible , supersonic turbulence of burgers type on large scales .",
    "we find evidence for a transition to subsonic , kolmogorov turbulence with on scales smaller than the sonic scale ( see figure  [ fig : velspectra ] ) .",
