    "this compound is a realization of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin system with a disordered ground state even at very low temperatures and a spin gap @xmath0  24  -1 ( 3  mev ) from the singlet ( @xmath1 ) ground state to the lowest excited triplet ( @xmath2 ) state  @xcite .",
    "the strengths of the relevant magnetic interactions place this compound close to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "moreover , data in high magnetic fields show plateaus at commensurate ( 1/8 , 1/4 and 1/3 ) values of the saturation magnetization  @xcite .",
    "the plateau states can be thought of as crystalline arrangements of magnetic moments separating regions of continuous rise in magnetization , the latter allowing for an interpretation in terms of bose - einstein condensation of triplet excitations  @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested  @xcite that doping in this system ( regarded as a mott - hubbard insulator ) may lead to a superconducting phase mediated by antiferromagnetic ( af ) fluctuations , a mechanism similar in spirit to one of the scenarios proposed for the high t@xmath3 cuprates  @xcite .",

    "inversion symmetry is lost as well below t@xmath3 but the number of atoms in the unit cell remains unchanged due to the orthogonality of the spin - dimer network . because of the same orthogonal arrangement , there are two spin dimers in the unit cell . as a result ,",
    "the spin gap excitation , defined as the transition from the @xmath8 ground state to that ( usually the lowest in energy ) @xmath9 level whose wavefunction contains a single spin dimer excited to the triplet state @xcite , has a fine structure made out of six levels , three from each dimer in the unit cell .",
    "the 2d spin - dimer lattice can be described well by taking into account the nearest and next nearest neighbor af super - exchange interactions @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , see fig .",

    "spin - phonon interaction has been invoked in order to explain the selection rules of the magnetic transitions seen in infra - red ( ir ) absorption  @xcite .",
    "the coupling between the lattice and magnetic degrees of freedom was also taken into account in order to describe the spin density profile at high fields in the magnetization plateau states  @xcite . so far",
    "the study of phononic excitations has been related mostly to the crystallographic changes at 395  k. it has been established in refs .",
    "@xcite that the structural transition displays soft mode behavior ( see refs .",
    "@xcite also for a phononic symmetry analysis ) .",
    "the phononic mode which condenses at 395  k belongs to the b@xmath14 representation of the high temperature symmetry group and , in terms of cu atoms , it involves essentially an alternate displacement along the @xmath15-axis of the nearest neighbor dimers .",
    "interestingly , several phonons appearing below t@xmath3 were observed in @xmath16 polarization as very close in energy shoulders of some of the modes found above the transition . due to the absence of inversion symmetry below 395",

    "the emphasis is however on the elementary and composite collective excitations in the @xmath2 sector , the main results being related to the experimental determination of their symmetries and anisotropic behavior in magnetic fields .",
    "we are also able to relate some of these new findings to results of a 4-spin cluster analysis as well as to propose an additional effective spin interaction induced by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "it has been established that due to the frustrated nature of the magnetic interactions , the one triplet excitations are local , weakly dispersive in the reciprocal space , while two - particle states are more mobile  @xcite and have contributions from the whole brillouin zone  @xcite .    in spite of a lot of experimental and theoretical effort for understanding the magnetic properties",
    "there are several open questions .",
    "an exact determination of the ratio of the exchange interactions @xmath13 , which is important due to the proximity to the qcp , is still missing . one interesting aspect in this regard",
    "is the observation of a magnetic state at 21.5  -1 , which is _ below _ the energy of the spin gap multiplet @xmath20 .",
    "this could be seen in esr  @xcite , ins  @xcite and ir  @xcite data in energy level anti - crossings in the downward dispersions with magnetic field of some of the spin gap branches .",
    "the existence of such a low energy mode brings into question the exact quantitative estimation of the af exchange parameters .",
    "as we will show , a direct comparison between our experimental findings and theoretical predictions regarding the symmetry of these modes is illuminating in this respect .",
    "a different set of questions is related to the way the external radiation field couples to the magnetic excitations .",
    "while the photon induced spin - exchange process insures the raman coupling to @xmath8 two - triplet excitations  @xcite , the transitions to @xmath9 states require the presence of spin - orbit coupling  @xcite . although an effective antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) term originating in the spin - orbit interaction ( the @xmath21 contribution explicitly written in eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] ) has been proposed to explain the fine structure of the six levels forming the gap multiplet around 24  -1 seen in a neutron scattering study , ref .",
    "@xcite , this term does not mix the singlet ground state to excited @xmath2 states . as a result ,",
    "the nature of the coupling leading to the observed esr and ir data is still to be understood .",
    "possible candidates were suggested in the discussion of esr data  @xcite and dynamical spin - phonon induced effective dm interactions have been invoked in order to explain the optical absorption spectra  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study phononic modes and collective magnetic excitations in with the experimental emphasis placed on the understanding of the magnetic raman scattering in the @xmath22 channel . in the low temperature in - plane polarized phononic spectra we find ( in the 50  -  350  -1 energy range ) several pairs of modes with similar energies .",
    "this quasi - degeneracy is intriguing because group theory analysis suggests that they are related to different atomic vibrational patterns . regarding the magnetic raman scattering data , our novel findings are the following . the symmetry analysis and exact diagonalization of the 4-spin system hamiltonian ( see fig .",

    "in fig .  2 we show six low temperature raman spectra excited with the @xmath51  ev laser energy .",
    "the arrows point to the observed modes above 60  -1 and also shown are their energies and symmetries .",
    "magnetic fields do not affect their energies which indicates the phononic nature of these excitations .",
    "the modes below 60  -1 are not indexed since they will be discussed in the next sections .",
    "the excitation at 59  -1 corresponds to the fully symmetric soft mode of the structural transition at 395  k  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding two - phonon excitation in the a@xmath49 channel is seen at 121.8  -1 and very close to it another sharp mode with b@xmath49 symmetry .",
    "similarly to the data in @xmath16 polarization in ref .",
    "@xcite , where below 395  k several new modes appear as shoulders of phonons existing above the transition , we observe several pairs of modes having close energies .",
    "for example doublet structures are observed around 155  -1 , where we see a pair of b@xmath50 and a@xmath50 excitations , around 285  -1 , where we observe two modes having b@xmath49 and a@xmath49 symmetries , and also around 320  -1 where we see a pair made of b@xmath50 and b@xmath49 symmetric excitations .",
    "one way to explain this behavior , suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , is to assume that in the high temperature phase there are phonons which are odd ( ungerade : u ) and even ( gerade : g ) with respect to inversion but very close in energy and to try to identify them by looking at similar atomic vibrations corresponding to u and g representations respectively .",
    "following this idea in more detail and taking into account that the set of irreducible representations \\{a@xmath52,a@xmath53,b@xmath52,b@xmath53,a@xmath14,a@xmath54,b@xmath14,b@xmath54 } of the @xmath44 point group becomes the set of \\{a@xmath49,a@xmath50,b@xmath49,b@xmath50,b@xmath49,b@xmath50,a@xmath49,a@xmath50 } representations ( in this order ) in @xmath45 , we would have for example that the ( a@xmath49,b@xmath49 ) pair around 284  -1 corresponds either to a ( a@xmath52,a@xmath14 ) group or to a ( b@xmath14,b@xmath52 ) group in the high temperature phase .",
    "this is because we chose gerade - ungerade pairs and , as shown above , the a@xmath49 symmetric mode can originate either from a a@xmath52 or a b@xmath14 symmetric phonon while the b@xmath49 mode could be either a b@xmath52 or a a@xmath14 phonon in the high temperature phase .",
    "similar reasoning would suggest that the ( b@xmath49,b@xmath50 ) group around 320  -1 originates either from a pair of ( b@xmath52,a@xmath54 ) or ( b@xmath53,a@xmath14 ) above 395  k and also that the origin of the ( b@xmath50,a@xmath50 ) group around 155  -1 can be pairs of ( b@xmath53,b@xmath54 ) or ( a@xmath53,b@xmath14 ) modes in the @xmath6 phase which has @xmath44 as the associated point group .",
    "we performed a symmetry analysis of the @xmath55 atomic vibrations in the high temperature phase and our conclusion is that the approach suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite does not provide an a priori reason for the quasi - degeneracy .",
    "this conclusion , as explained in the following , is based just on a simple inspection of the character table of the @xmath44 point group  @xcite .",
    "one can easily note that in @xmath44 the even modes are symmetric with respect to the mirror symmetry in the cu(bo@xmath56 ) planes while the odd vibrations are antisymmetric with respect to this symmetry operation .",
    "this means that the u phonons in the high temperature phase correspond to vibrations of the atoms along the @xmath15-axis while the g modes consist of in - plane movements . due to this difference in the oscillation patterns ,",
    "one parallel and one perpendicular to the cubo@xmath56 planes , it is hard to explain the closeness of phononic energies at this qualitative level .",
    "this is why we find intriguing the observed quasi - degeneracy of the phononic modes in the context of the present crystal structure determination .",
    "we remark that on the other hand one could find vibrations which involve similar oscillations at the molecular level ( for instance groups of atoms forming the cu - o spin dimer structure or groups of o2 atoms bridging nearest neighbor spin dimers ) and which belong to different group representations because of the different inter - molecular phase pattern .",
    "we suggest that , remaining within the conclusions of x - ray studies  @xcite which so far have not found evidences for additional crystallographic changes at low temperatures ( that in turn may produce phonon splittings ) , good candidates for understanding this behavior are provided by the inter - dimer bo@xmath56 molecular complexes whose rotations as a whole around the @xmath57 and @xmath15-axes or whose in and out of the plane translations may turn out to be similar in energies .",
    "the data suggest that theoretical work in this respect could be interesting .",
    "we note that the appearance of the weak 155.9  -1 mode in the @xmath39 , @xmath5 and @xmath48 polarizations singles this mode out from the other excitations because it belongs to the a@xmath50 symmetry channel . the raman coupling to this excitation is unusual compared to the other modes in the sense that it can not take place @xmath58 two electric dipole transitions .",
    "we find several magnetic resonances ( see fig .",
    "3 ) with a@xmath50 symmetry , but the absence of magnetic field effects suggests that this mode has a preponderant phononic character . a finite intensity of such excitation provides direct evidence for spin - phonon coupling in .",
    "the irreducible representations of the @xmath45 point group probed by six scattering geometries , discussed also in the experimental section , are shown in the legend of fig .",
    "3 . in this figure , the six low temperature raman spectra from fig .  2 are shown for the frequency region below 60  -1 .",
    "three strong features around 23 , 29 and 38 -1 , denoted by t@xmath59 , s@xmath49 and t@xmath50 , are observed and they transform like the a@xmath50 , b@xmath49 and a@xmath50 representations respectively . besides these three modes , we observe several other weaker excitations . among them",
    "we see a set of three a@xmath50 symmetric modes denoted by t@xmath56 , t@xmath60 and t@xmath61 .",
    "we also note the presence of the excitations denoted by t@xmath62 and t@xmath63 which have b@xmath49 and b@xmath50 symmetries , giving rise to a small feature seen around 25.6  -1 in all polarizations except for the @xmath39 configuration .",
    "table  [ modes ] contains a summary of the observed excitations below the 60  -1 frequency range .",
    "the energies of these raman active excitations are in agreement with those where ins  @xcite , esr  @xcite and ir  @xcite data observed magnetic modes .",
    "the data in magnetic fields ( see the discussion in the following section ) confirm the magnetic nature and the predominant @xmath2 character of the t modes . therefore t@xmath59 , t@xmath62 and t@xmath63 excitations modes seem to belong to the spin gap multiplet while t@xmath50 , t@xmath56 , t@xmath60 and t@xmath61 would correspond to multi - particle triplet channels .    if the picture of real space localized elementary triplets is true , then one expects that the analysis of the 4-spin cluster in fig .",

    "the doubly degenerate e modes , t@xmath64 and t@xmath65 , are not observed in zero field when the light propagates parallel to the @xmath15-axis because they are accessible only in @xmath16 or @xmath66 polarizations .",

    "the largest discrepancy between the experimental data and the calculation is seen in fig .",
    "one aspect in this regard is that the value @xmath82 had to be chosen greater than that of @xmath67 .",
    "this is unexpected because @xmath67 is allowed by symmetry both above and below the structural phase transition at 395  k while the existence of a finite intra - dimer dm interaction is allowed only below 395  k , when the mirror symmetry of the @xmath5 plane is broken .",
    "additional terms may be responsible for this disagreement , possible candidates being the in - plane components of the inter - dimer dm interaction , which should also be allowed below the structural phase transition .",
    "we now discuss the existence of a magnetic mode _ below _ the spin gap value  @xcite . in order to reproduce the upward dispersion with fields @xmath84 of the t@xmath59 mode we had to choose a value for @xmath13 which is greater than 0.5 ,",
    "otherwise this excitation would have displayed a downward dispersion .",
    "> from fig .",
    "4a we observe that @xmath87  0.5 implies that > the position of the bound singlet state is below @xmath20 .",
    "we suggest that precisely this state may be responsible for the observations of the 21.5  -1 mode in refs .",
    "the presence of this excitation will also influence specific heat measurements and , in conjunction with the finite intra - dimer interaction @xmath82 , also the low temperature magnetization data which is not quantitatively understood yet  @xcite .",
    "the existence of this magnetic mode below the gap seems quantitatively at odds with theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , perturbational calculations predict the existence of a singlet state at 25  -1 , which is above but very close to the spin gap  @xcite .",
    "a quantitative reconciliation between theory and the observed selection rules in magnetic fields could be achieved if the coupling ratio @xmath88 is slightly increased from the value of 0.603 , as determined in ref .",
    "the experimental finding of the set of a@xmath50 modes ( t@xmath50 to t@xmath61 in fig .  3 ,",
    "all of them below the two - magnon continuum starting at 2@xmath0  48  -1 and whose symmetries are also not predicted by theory ) shows that although several aspects of the magnetic bound states are understood , a complete picture of the spin dynamics in the multi - triplet sectors is still to be achieved .",
    "fig .  7 shows two low temperature raman spectra taken in @xmath48 polarization with two incoming laser frequencies , @xmath89  =  1.92 and 2.6  ev .",
    "the point we want to make in this paragraph is that we observe two qualitatively different behaviors .",
    "firstly we notice that the area under the peak corresponding to the t@xmath59 mode in the spectrum taken with the excitation energy @xmath89",
    "=  1.92 is of the same order of magnitude as the one in the spectrum taken with the 2.6  ev laser excitation frequency .",
    "the same observation is also true for the mode denoted by t@xmath50 .",
    "> from this perspective , a different behavior is observed for other > modes and an example is the group of modes denoted by t@xmath62 , > s@xmath49 , s@xmath50 and s@xmath56 . in this latter case for instance , it is clearly seen in our spectra that the mode s@xmath49 in the spectrum taken with the @xmath89  =  2.6  ev excitation is several orders of magnitude stronger than when using the @xmath89  =  1.92  ev laser line . also , while the modes t@xmath62 , s@xmath50 and s@xmath56 are barely visible when @xmath89  =  1.92  ev ( see also fig .",
    "3 ) , they become quite strong for @xmath89  =  2.6  ev . fig .  5 shows in addition",
    "that other modes in the 50 to 70  -1 energy range also become visible only in the @xmath89  =  2.6  ev spectrum .",
    "we conclude this paragraph by saying that the group \\{t@xmath59,t@xmath50 } has a different resonance behavior than the group \\{t@xmath62,s@xmath49,s@xmath50,s@xmath56 } in the sense that their relative intensities are quite different for the two laser excitation frequencies used",
    ".    note that in the paragraph above we commented only on the _ relative _ intensities of the raman modes when the @xmath89  =  1.92  ev excitation was used compared to the 2.6  ev line . although the absolute intensities of each the raman excitations can be affected by optical corrections of the data , this effect cancels out when relative intensity ratios are considered . in other words , it is possible in principle that optical corrections can change the ratio of the absolute values of the raman intensities of the t@xmath59 or t@xmath50 modes when taken with @xmath89  =  1.92 and 2.6  ev laser energies respectively .",
    "the same observation applies when we relatively compare the intensities of the t@xmath62 , s@xmath49 , s@xmath50 and s@xmath56 for these two excitations .",
    "however , the important point is that the ratio of intensities should be affected in exactly the same way _ if the same resonance mechanism was responsible for both the \\{t@xmath59,t@xmath50 } group of excitations on one hand and for the group of modes \\{t@xmath62,s@xmath49,s@xmath50,s@xmath56 } on the other hand_. the conclusion following from the above discussion is that the data in fig .  7 proves the existence of two light coupling mechanisms to the observed low energy excitations",
    "in fact , further support for our statement comes from preliminary data which show that the 1.92 and 2.6  ev laser excitations energies correspond to regions in the visible range where distinct features of the reflectivity spectrum are observed  @xcite .",
    "while certainly interesting in this respect , a complete determination of the optical parameters of in the visible range and the identification of the specific high energy electronic intermediate states involved in the coupling mechanisms goes beyond the scope of our article and , as explained above , can not change our conclusions .",
    "the resonance of the b@xmath49 symmetric t@xmath90 magnetic mode , enhanced for @xmath89  =  2.6  ev , is similar to the one corresponding to s@xmath49 , s@xmath50 and s@xmath56 excitations as well as to the behavior of the new modes seen around 55 , 59 and 68  -1 .",
    "the results of perturbational analysis regarding energy scales and symmetries  @xcite , in particular of a b@xmath49 symmetric @xmath91 states at 45  -1 , argues for the magnetic nature of the mode s@xmath56 ,  ref.@xcite . just on the account of the similar resonance behavior of the s@xmath56 excitation with respect to the modes found above 50  -1",
    "one can not unambiguously identify the latter as magnetic bound states as well .",
    "the lack of energy shift in magnetic fields is consistent with such an interpretation , but the same would be true if they had a phononic origin .",
    "we discuss below the nature of the two light coupling mechanisms to magnetic excitations .",
    "for the set of modes discussed in fig .",
    "6c - d we propose that the coupling takes place @xmath58 the spin - orbit interaction which can be written in an effective form as @xmath92 ( ref .",
    "as it is found experimentally , in zero field this interaction hamiltonian probes indeed excitations with a@xmath50 symmetry ( the t@xmath59 mode ) and the calculated magnetic field dependent intensities for this and other modes in fig .",
    "6c - d is also in agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the coupling to the t@xmath62 and t@xmath63 modes from fig .",
    "3 can be possibly understood if we invoke the usual effective spin interaction corresponding to the photon induced spin exchange process @xmath93 . here",
    "the sum runs over pairs of lattice sites , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the exchanged spins on sites @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , while * r*@xmath96 is the vector connecting these sites  @xcite .",
    "the explicit expression of this interaction for several polarizations in the 4-spin cluster approximation contains finite coupling in b@xmath49 and b@xmath50 channels for the triplet t@xmath62 and t@xmath63 states .",
    "this explains the presence of the 25.6  -1 magnetic modes in all polarizations except  @xmath39 .",
    "the difference in the coupling strengths seen in fig .",
    "7 is thus understandable because these two light coupling mechanisms given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 need not be simultaneously in resonance with the same high energy excited electronic states .",
    "the photon induced spin exchange hamiltonian , @xmath78 , is usually invoked in order to explain raman active @xmath8 two - magnon type excitations in various magnetic systems  @xcite .",
    "is an example where this hamiltonian , in the presence of singlet - triplet mixing dm interactions , can be used to account for coupling to @xmath2 states .",
    "we also note that in principle the photon induced spin exchange could provide coupling to the 21.5  -1 @xmath8 bound state below the spin gap .",
    "the reason this mode is not directly observed in our spectra for any of the two excitation energies used in fig .  6 is an open question .",
    "however , one possible explanation is that the raman form factor for exciting pairs of @xmath55 magnons is vanishing as opposed to the case zone boundary modes .",
    "an example is the case of the raman vertex calculated for the 2d square lattice within the spin - wave approximation  @xcite and using the fleury - loudon  @xcite interaction .",
    "consequently , both the 21.5 and the 28.9  -1 excitations could be attributed to @xmath8 bound states but originating from different parts of the brillouin zone and having substantially different binding energies .",
    "we study by raman scattering collective magnetic excitations in the spin - dimer compound .",
    "regarding the one - triplet sector , we showed that by using a 4-spin cluster approximation and by including an additional intra - dimer dm interaction we are able to explain the observed zero field symmetry selection rules and the rich behavior in magnetic fields .",
    "we are also able to experimentally demonstrate the existence of two effective magnetic light scattering hamiltonians which are responsible for their resonance behavior .",
    "the 4-spin approximation fails to account for the excitations seen in the multi - particle magnetic sectors . in particular",
    ", the existence of a set of four modes below the onset of the two - triplet continuum ( at 37.5 , 40.8 , 44.5 and 50.9  -1 in the a@xmath50 symmetry channel ) shows that further theoretical analysis is required in order to understand the nature of these composite excitations .",
    "we suggest a possible explanation for the existence of a sub - gap collective mode in terms of a strongly bound singlet state which can be generated within the space of 4 nearest neighbor spin dimers .    experimental data in the energy range below 350",
    "-1 shows the existence of several quasi - degenerate phonons .",
    "general symmetry arguments suggest that these excitations , which are very close in energy , involve different vibrational patterns ( in plane and @xmath15-axis atomic motions respectively ) . the failure of group theory to provide an understanding of this interesting behavior at a qualitative level calls for a detailed theoretical investigation of the vibrational modes .",
    "we also find a weak a@xmath50 symmetric phonon at 155.9  -1 .",
    "the energy and symmetry of this excitation suggest that this is a coupled spin - phonon excitation and can be evidence for the existence of magneto - elastic interactions in ."
