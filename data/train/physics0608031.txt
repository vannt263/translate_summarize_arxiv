    "is assigned a value of @xmath3 or @xmath4 if it connects two individuals who are friends or enemies respectively .",
    "the sign @xmath5 of a link we call also its spin .",
    "if the product of links along the boundary of a triad is negative , the triad is called frustrated ( or imbalanced ) , otherwise it is called balanced ( or unfrustrated ) .",
    "the state of the network is called balanced if all triads are balanced .",
    "if the balanced state is achieved by all links being positive the state is called `` paradise '' .",
    "the algorithm depends on a parameter @xmath6 $ ] called propensity which determines the tendency of the system to reduce frustration via flipping a negative link to a positive one with probability @xmath2 or via flipping a positive link to a negative with probability @xmath7 . for an all - to - all topology antal",

    "predict a transition from imbalanced stationary states for @xmath8 to balanced stationary states for @xmath9 . here",
    "the dynamics is motivated by social applications so that the notion of frustration from physics goes along with frustration in the psychological sense .",
    "+ beyond frustration in social systems , within physics , the notion is familiar from spin glasses .",
    "it is the degree of frustration in spin glasses which determines the qualitative features of the energy landscape",
    ". a high [ low ] degree of frustration corresponds to many [ few ] local minima in the energy landscape . in terms of energy landscape",
    "it was speculated by sasai and wolynes @xcite that is the low degree of frustration in a genetic network which is responsible for the few stable cell states in the high - dimensional space of states . + calculational tools from spin - glass theory like the replica - method @xcite turned out to be quite useful in connection with generic optimization problems ( as they occur , for example , in computer science ) whenever there is a map between the spin - glass hamiltonian and a cost function .",
    "the goal in finding the ground state - energy of the hamiltonian translates to the minimization of the costs .",
    "a particular class of the optimization problems refers to the satisfiability problems .",
    "more specifically one has a system of @xmath10 boolean variables and @xmath11 logical constraints ( clauses ) between them . in this case , minimizing the costs means minimizing the number of violated constraints . in case of the existence of a non - violating configuration",
    "the problem is said to be satisfiable , it has a zero - ground state energy in the hamiltonian language .",
    "here it is obvious that computer algorithms designed to find the optimal solution have to reduce the frustration down to a minimal value .",
    "so the reduction of frustration is in common to very different dynamical processes .",
    "+ the algorithms we have to deal with belong to the so - called incomplete algorithms @xcite characterized by some kind of monte - carlo dynamics that tries to find the solution via stochastic local moves in configuration space , starting from a random initial configuration .",
    "it either finds the solution `` fast '' or never ( this will be made more precise below ) . among the satisfiability problems there are the @xmath0-sat ( @xmath0s ) problems @xcite , for which actually no frustration - free solution exists above a certain threshold in the density of clauses imposed on the system . in this case the unsatisfiability is not a feature of the algorithm but intrinsic to the problem .",
    "however , there is a special case of @xmath0s problems , so - called @xmath0-xor - sat ( @xmath0xs ) problems @xcite which are always solvable by some global algorithm , but poses a challenge for finding the solution by some kind of monte - carlo dynamics , very similar to the one used for solving the @xmath0s problem , where actually no solution may exist .",
    "now it is these @xmath0xs problems and their solutions that are related to the social balance dynamics .",
    "+ in particular it can be easily shown @xcite that the satisfiability problem @xmath12s ( and also the subclass @xmath12xs ) can first be mapped onto a @xmath12-spin model that is a spin - glass , and as we shall show below , the @xmath12-spin glass model can next be mapped onto the triad dynamics of antal _",
    "the @xmath0xs problem is usually studied for diluted connections because the interesting changes in the phase structure of the @xmath0xs problem appear at certain threshold parameters in the dilution , while the all - to - all case is not of particular interest there .",
    "+ dilution of the all - to - all topology is not only needed for the mapping to the @xmath12xs problem in its usual form .",
    "it is also a natural generalization of the triad dynamics considered in @xcite for social balance .",
    "a diluted network is more realistic than an all - to - all topology by two reasons : either two individuals may not know each other at all ( this is very likely in case of a large population size ) or they neither like or dislike each other , but are indifferent as emphasized in @xcite as an argument for the postulated absence of links . for introducing dilution into the all - to - all network considered by antal _",
    "_ it is quite natural to study random erds - rnyi networks @xcite for which two nodes are connected by a link with probability @xmath13 . on the other hand , dilution in the @xmath0xs problem",
    "is parameterized by the ratio @xmath14 of number of clauses over number of variables ( variables in the corresponding spin model or number of links in the triad dynamics ) .",
    "we will determine the map between both parameterizations .",
    "+   + in the first part of this paper ( section [ model ] ) we generalize the triad dynamics to @xmath0-cycle dynamics , driven by the reduction of frustration , with arbitrary integer @xmath0 . in the context of _ social balance _",
    "theory , cartwright and harary @xcite introduced the notion of balance describing a balanced state with all @xmath0-cycles being balanced and @xmath0 not restricted to three .",
    "we first study such model on fully connected networks ( section [ complete ] ) . for given fixed and integer @xmath15 in the updating rules ,",
    "we draw the differential equations of the time evolution due to the local dynamics ( section [ evolution ] ) and we predict the stationary densities of @xmath0-cycles , @xmath0 arbitrary integer , containing @xmath16 negative links ( section [ stationary ] ) . as long as @xmath0 is odd ( section [ odd ] ) in the updating dynamics ,",
    "the results are only quantitatively different from the case of @xmath17 considered in @xcite .",
    "an odd cycle of length three is , however , not an allowed loop in a bipartite graph , for which links may only exist between different type of vertices so that the length of a loop of minimal size in a bipartite graph is four . in addition , a @xmath18-cycle with four negative links ( that is four individuals each of which dislikes two others ) is balanced and not frustrated , although it may be called the `` hell '' , so it does not need to be updated in order to reduce its frustration . ( to call the hell with four negative links balanced is not specific for the notion of frustration in physics ; also in social balance theory it is the product over links in the loop which counts and decides about balance or frustration @xcite . )",
    "this difference is essential as compared to the triad dynamics , in which a triad of three unfriendly links is always updated .",
    "it has important implications on the phase structure as we will show . for even values of @xmath0 and larger than four , again there are only quantitative differences in the phase structure as compared to @xmath19 ( section [ even ] ) . + as in @xcite , for odd values of @xmath0 , we shall distinguish between stationary states in the infinite volume limit that can be either balanced ( for @xmath20 ) or frustrated ( for @xmath21 ) since it is not possible to reach the paradise in a finite time .",
    "they are predicted as solutions of mean field equations . in numerical simulations , fluctuations about their stationary values do not die out in the phase for @xmath21 so that some frustration remains , while for @xmath20 frozen states are always reached in the form of the paradise although other balanced states with a finite amount of negative links are in principle available , but are quite unlikely to be realized during the finite simulation time .",
    "they are exponentially suppressed due to their small weight in configuration space .",
    "we calculate the time it takes to reach a frozen state at and above the phase transition ( section [ time_odd ] ) . for even values of @xmath0",
    "we have only two types of stationary frozen states , `` paradise '' and `` hell '' with all links being positive and negative , respectively . in this case",
    "the time to reach the frozen states at the transition can be calculated in two ways .",
    "the first possibility applies for both even and odd values of @xmath0 and is based on calculating the time it takes until a fluctuation is of the same order in size as the average density of unfriendly links .",
    "the second one , applicable to the case of even values of @xmath0 , can be obtained by mapping the social system to a markov process known as the wright - fisher model for diploid organisms @xcite , for which the decay time to one of the final configurations ( all `` positive '' or all `` negative '' genes ) increases quadratically in the size @xmath22 of the system ( section [ sec : time_even ] ) . +",
    "in the second part we generalize the @xmath0-cycle dynamics to diluted systems ( section [ sec : diluted ] ) .",
    "the dilution , originally given in terms of the probability for connecting two links in a random erds - rnyi network @xcite , is then parameterized in terms of the dilution parameter @xmath14 , and the results for stationary and frozen states and the time needed to reach them will be given as a function of @xmath14 ( section [ sec : ratio ] ) .",
    "the original triad dynamics of antal _",
    "et al . _ with propensity parameter @xmath2 on a diluted",
    "network contains , as special case , the usual random - walk sat ( rws ) algorithm for finding the solution of the @xmath12xs problem corresponding to the choice of @xmath23 in the triad dynamics .",
    "therefore it is natural to generalize the rws algorithm for generic @xmath24 $ ] and to study the modifications in the performance of the algorithm as a function of @xmath2 ( section [ sec : rws ] ) . for the @xmath0s problem , and similarly for the @xmath0xs problem , there are three thresholds in @xmath14 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 with @xmath28 . roughly speaking",
    ", the threshold @xmath25 corresponds to a dynamical transition between a phase in which the rws algorithm finds a solution in a time linearly increasing with the size of the system for @xmath29 , and exponentially increasing with the system size for @xmath30 .",
    "the value @xmath26 characterizes a transition in the structure of the solution space , from one cluster of exponentially many solutions ( @xmath31 ) to exponentially many clusters of solutions ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath27 refers to the transition between satisfiable and unsatisfiable @xmath0s problems , this means that for these models not all constraints can be satisfied simultaneously in the unsat - phase for @xmath33 so that a finite amount of frustration remains . above this last threshold",
    "lies a value of @xmath34 , such that for @xmath35 the mean field approximation is justified that was used for the maximum value of @xmath14 in the all - to - all topology of the triad dynamics of @xcite .",
    "we shall study the influence of the parameter @xmath2 on the value of @xmath25 ( section [ sec : alphad ] ) and on the hamming distance for @xmath14 smaller @xmath26 or larger @xmath26 ( section [ sec : alphas ] ) .",
    "moreover we will show how the choice of @xmath2 changes the possibility to find a solution for the @xmath0xs problem ( section [ sec : pc ] ) and we will determine the validity range of the mean - field approximation ( section [ sec : alpham ] ) .",
    "as it turns out , the parameter @xmath2 introduces some bias in the rws , accelerating the convergence to `` paradise '' and reducing the explored part of configuration space . on the other hand , an inappropriate choice of @xmath2 or too much dilution may prevent an approach to paradise . fluctuations in the wrong direction ,",
    "increasing the amount of frustration , go along with improved convergence to the balanced state .",
    "we represent individuals as vertices ( or nodes ) of a graph and a relationship between two individuals as a link ( or edge ) that connects the corresponding vertices .",
    "moreover we assign to a link @xmath36 between two nodes @xmath37 and @xmath38 a binary spin variable @xmath39 , with @xmath40 if the individuals @xmath37 and @xmath38 are friends , and @xmath41 if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are enemies .",
    "we consider the standard notion of _ social balance _ extended to cycles of order @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in particular a cycle of order @xmath0 ( or a @xmath0-cycle ) is defined as a closed path between @xmath0 distinct nodes @xmath42 , @xmath43 ,  , @xmath44 of the network , where the path is performed along the links of the network @xmath45 , @xmath46 , ",
    ", @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "given a value of @xmath0 we have @xmath49 different types @xmath50 , @xmath51 ,  , @xmath52 ,  , @xmath53 of cycles of order @xmath0 containing @xmath54 , @xmath55 ,  , @xmath38 ,  , @xmath0 negative links , respectively .",
    "a cycle of order @xmath0 in the network is considered as balanced if the product of the signs of links along the cycle equals @xmath55 , otherwise the cycle is considered as imbalanced or frustrated .",
    "accordingly , the network is considered as balanced if each @xmath0-cycle of the network is balanced . + we consider our social network as a dynamical system .",
    "we perform a local unconstrained dynamics obtained by a natural generalization of the local triads dynamics , recently proposed by antal _",
    "we first fix a value of @xmath0 .",
    "next , at each update we choose at random a @xmath0-cycle @xmath52 . if this @xmath0-cycle @xmath52 is balanced ( @xmath38 is even ) nothing happens .",
    "if @xmath52 is imbalanced ( @xmath38 is odd ) we change one of its link as follows : if @xmath56 , then @xmath57 occurs with probability @xmath2 , while @xmath58 occurs with probability @xmath7 ; if @xmath59 , then @xmath60 happens with probability @xmath55 . during one update , the positive [ negative ] link which we flip to take a negative [ positive ] sign",
    "is chosen at random between all the possible positive [ negative ] links belonging to the @xmath0-cycle @xmath52 .",
    "one unit of time is defined as a number of updates equal to @xmath61 , where @xmath61 total number of links of the network . in figure",
    "[ fig : example ] we show a simple scheme that illustrates the dynamical rules in the case @xmath19 ( a ) and @xmath62 ( b ) .",
    "it is evident from the figure that for even values of @xmath0 the system remains the same if we simultaneously flip all the spins @xmath63 @xmath64 and make the transformation @xmath65 .",
    "the same is not true for odd values of @xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that a @xmath0-cycle with only `` unfriendly '' links is balanced for even values of @xmath0 , while it is imbalanced for odd values of @xmath0 .",
    "the presence or absence of this symmetry property for even values of @xmath0 or odd , respectively , is responsible for very different features in the phase structure .",
    "this will be studied in detail in the following sections .",

    "we first consider the case of fully connected networks .",
    "later we extend the main results to the case of diluted networks in section [ sec : diluted ] . in a complete graph",
    "every individual has a relationship with everyone else .",
    "let @xmath22 be the number of nodes of this complete graph .",
    "the total number of links of the network is then given by @xmath66 , while the total number of @xmath0-cycles is given by @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 is the standard notation of the binomial coefficient .",
    "it counts the total number of different ways of choosing @xmath69 elements out of @xmath70 elements in total , while it is @xmath71 , with @xmath72 .",
    "moreover we define @xmath73 as the number of @xmath0-cycles containing @xmath38 negative links , and @xmath74 the respective density of @xmath0-cycles of type @xmath52 . the total number of positive links @xmath75 is then related to the number of @xmath0-cycles by the relation @xmath76 a similar relation holds for the total number of negative links @xmath77 @xmath78 in particular , in eq.s ( [ eq : link_positive ] ) and ( [ eq : link_negative ] ) the numerators give us the total number of positive and negative links in all the @xmath0-cycles , respectively , while the same denominator comes out from the fact that one link belongs to @xmath79 different @xmath0-cycles .",
    "furthermore the density of positive links is @xmath80 , while the density of negative links is @xmath81 .      in view of deriving the mean field equations for the unconstrained dynamics , introduced in the former section [ model ] , we need to define the quantity @xmath82 as the average number of @xmath0-cycles of type @xmath52 which are attached to a positive link .",
    "this number is given by @xmath83while similarly @xmath84counts the average number of @xmath0-cycles of type @xmath52 attached to a negative link .",
    "in term of densities we can easily write @xmath85 and @xmath86 now let @xmath87 be the probability that a link flips its sign from positive to negative in one update event and @xmath88 the probability that a negative link changes its sign to @xmath3 in one update event .",
    "we can write such probabilities as @xmath89 and @xmath90 valid for the case odd values of @xmath0 . for even values of @xmath0 , these probabilities read @xmath91 and @xmath92 since each update changes @xmath93 @xmath0-cycles , and also the number of updates in one time step is equal to @xmath61 update events , the rate equations in the mean field approximation can be written as @xmath94 we remark that the only difference between the cases of odd values of @xmath0 and even values of @xmath0 comes from eq.s ( [ eq : prob_positive_odd ] ) and ( [ eq : prob_negative_odd ] ) , and eq.s ( [ eq : prob_positive_even ] ) and ( [ eq : prob_negative_even ] ) , respectively .",
    "this difference is the main reason why the two cases odd values of @xmath0 and even values of @xmath0 lead to two completely different behavior and why we treat them separately in the following section [ stationary ] .",
    "next let us derive the stationary states from the rate equations ( [ eq : mean_field ] ) that give a proper description of the unconstrained dynamics of @xmath0-cycles in a complete graph . imposing the stationary condition @xmath95 , @xmath96",

    "this means that the densities of a cycle of order @xmath17 or a cycle of order @xmath62 with @xmath38 negative links are simply given by the probability of finding these densities on a complete graph in which each link is set equal to @xmath55 with probability @xmath111 or equal to @xmath4 with probability @xmath117 .",
    "( as already noticed in @xcite , this result may come a bit as a surprise , because the @xmath12-cycle or here the @xmath118-cycle dynamics seems to be biased towards the reduction of frustration , on the other hand it is a bias for individual triads without any constraint of the type that the frustration of the whole `` society '' should get reduced . )",
    "+ for odd values of @xmath119 , a stationary solution always exists .",
    "this solution becomes harder to find as @xmath0 increases , because the maximal order of the polynomials involved increases with @xmath0 ( for @xmath17 we have polynomials of first order , for @xmath62 polynomials of second order , for @xmath120 of third and so on ) .",

    "qualitatively this means that the dilution @xmath14 of the system needed to reach the theoretical expectation of eq.([eq : antal2 ] ) is smaller than @xmath335 for @xmath8 . in general",
    "we can say that @xmath335 is a function of @xmath2 : @xmath439 , and @xmath335 is the minimum value of the dilution of the system for which we can effectively describe the diluted system as an all - to - all system for all the values of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , it should be noticed that for @xmath440 almost all variables belong to at least three clauses [ see figure [ fig : probdil ] ] .",
    "this fact allows the @xmath2rws to explore a larger part of configuration space .",
    "let us assume that one variable belongs to less than three clauses : an eventual update event that flips this variable so that the one triad becomes balanced , can never increase the number of unsatisfied clauses by frustrating other clauses it belongs to .",
    "this reminds us to the situation in an energy landscape in which an algorithm gets stuck in a local minimum when it never accepts a change in the `` wrong '' direction , i.e. towards larger energy .     between @xmath434 the theoretical prediction for the stationary density of friendly variables [ eq.([eq : antal2 ] ) ] and the numerically measured value @xmath435 , as a function of the dilution parameter @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath435 is obtained as the average of the density of friendly links ( registered after a waiting time @xmath436 , so that is effectively stationary ) over @xmath130 different problems and @xmath130 different @xmath2rws for each problem .",
    "the results displayed here are obtained for @xmath430 ( open symbols ) and @xmath437 ( gray filled symbols ) and for different values of @xmath2 [ @xmath126 ( circles ) , @xmath23 ( squares ) , @xmath143 ( diamonds ) , @xmath232 ( triangles ) ] .",
    "the initial conditions are those of an antagonistic society .",
    "the dashed lines are proportional to @xmath438.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]",
    "in the first part of this paper we generalized the triad dynamics of antal _",
    "_ to a @xmath0-cycle dynamics @xcite .",
    "here we had to distinguish the cases of even values of @xmath0 and odd values of @xmath0 .",
    "for all values of integer @xmath0 there is again a critical threshold at @xmath441 in the propensity parameter . for odd @xmath0 and @xmath415 the paradise",
    "can never be reached in the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size ( as predicted by the mean field equations which we solved exactly for @xmath62 and approximately for @xmath119 ) . in the finite volume ,",
    "in principle one could reach a balanced state made out of two cliques ( a special case of this configuration is the `` paradise '' when one clique is empty ) .",
    "however , the probability for reaching such type of frozen state decreases exponentially with the system size so that in practice the fluctuations never die out in the numerical simulations . for @xmath145 the convergence time to reach the paradise grows logarithmically with the system size . at @xmath143 paradise",
    "is reached within a time that follows a power law in the size @xmath22 , where we determined the @xmath0-dependence of the exponent . in particular , the densities of @xmath0-cycles with @xmath38 negative links , here evolved according to the rules of the @xmath0-cycle dynamics , could be equally well obtained from a random dynamics in which each link is set equal to @xmath55 with probability @xmath111 or equal to @xmath4 with probability @xmath117 .",
    "this feature was already observed by antal _",
    "et al . _ for @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "it means that the individual updating rules which seem to be `` socially '' motivated in locally reducing the social tensions by changing links to friendly ones , end up with random distributions of friendly links .",
    "the reason is a missing constraint of the type that the overall number of frustrated @xmath0-cycles should not increase in an update event .",
    "such a constrained dynamics was studied by antal _",
    "_ in @xcite , but not in this paper .",
    "+ for even values of @xmath0 , the only stable solutions are `` heaven '' ( i.e. paradise ) and `` hell '' for @xmath145 and @xmath8 , respectively , and the time to reach these frozen configurations grows logarithmically with @xmath22 . at @xmath441",
    "other realizations of the frozen configurations are possible , in principle . however , they have negligible probability as compared to heaven and hell . here the time to reach these configurations increases quadratically in @xmath22 , independently of @xmath0 .",
    "this result was obtained in two ways . either from the criterion to reach the stable state",
    "when a large enough fluctuation drops the system into this state ( so we had to calculate how long one has to wait for such a big fluctuation ) .",
    "alternatively , the result could be read off from a mapping to a markov process for diploid organisms ending up in a genetic pool of either all `` @xmath248''-genes or all `` @xmath247''-genes .",
    "the difference in the possible stable states of diploid organisms and ours consists in two - clique stable solutions that are admissible for the even @xmath0-cycle dynamics , in principle , however such clique states have such a low probability of being realized that the difference is irrelevant . + the difference in the exponent at @xmath334 and the stable configurations above and below @xmath334 between the even and odd @xmath0-cycle dynamics was due to the fact that `` hell '' , a state with all links negative as in an antagonistic society , is a balanced state for even @xmath0 , not only by the frustration criterion of physicists , but also according to the criterion of social scientists @xcite .",
    "+   + as a second natural generalization of the social balance dynamics of antal _",
    "we considered a diluted network .",
    "one way of implementing the dilution is via a random erds - rnyi network , characterized by the probability @xmath13 for connecting a randomly chosen pair of nodes .",
    "here we focused our studies to the case @xmath17 .",
    "the mean - field description and the results about the phase structure remain valid down to a certain degree of dilution , characterized by @xmath442 .",
    "this threshold for the validity of the mean - field description practically coincides with the criterion whether a single link belongs to at least three triads ( for @xmath443 ) or not ( @xmath444 ) .",
    "if it does so , an update event can increase the number of frustrated triads . for @xmath444 , or more precisely @xmath445 it becomes easier to realize frozen configurations different from the paradise .",
    "isolated links do not get updated at all and isolated triads can freeze to a `` @xmath248''-``@xmath247''-configuration .",
    "the time to reach such a frozen configuration ( in general different from the paradise ) grows then only linearly in the system size .",
    "also the solution space , characterized by the average hamming distance between solutions , has different features below and above another threshold , called @xmath349 with @xmath446 .",
    "therefore one of the main differences between the all - to - all and the sufficiently diluted topology are the frozen configurations .",
    "for the all - to - all case we observed the paradise above @xmath334 for odd values of @xmath0 and even values of @xmath0 and the hell for even values of @xmath0 below @xmath334 , in the numerical simulations , because the probability to find a two - clique - frozen configuration was calculated to be negligibly small . for larger dilution , also other balanced configurations were numerically found , as mentioned above , and the time passed in the numerical simulations for finding these solutions followed the theoretical predictions . + in section [ sec : diluted ] we used , however , another parameterization in terms of the dilution parameter @xmath14 , that was the ratio of triads ( clauses ) over the number of links [ we gave anyway an approximated relation between @xmath14 and @xmath13 in eq.([eq : average_ratio ] ) ] .",
    "the reason for using this parameterization was a mapping of the @xmath0-cycle social balance of networks to a @xmath0-xor - sat ( @xmath0xs ) problem , that is a typical satisfiability problem in optimization tasks .",
    "we also traced a mapping between the `` social '' dynamical rules and the random - walk sat ( rws ) algorithm , that is one approach for solving this problem in a random local way .",
    "as we have shown , the diluted version of the @xmath12-cycle social dynamics with propensity parameter @xmath23 corresponds to a @xmath12xs problem solved by the rws algorithm in its standard form ( as used in @xcite ) .",
    "+ the @xmath0xs problem is always solvable like the @xmath0-cycle social balance , for which a two cliques solution always exists due to the structure theorem of @xcite , containing as a special solution the so - called paradise .",
    "the common challenge , however , is to find this solution by a local stochastic algorithm .",
    "the driving force , shared by both sets of problems , is the reduction of frustration .",
    "the meaning of frustration depends on the context : for the @xmath0-cycle dynamics it is meant in a social sense as a reduction of social tension , for the @xmath0xs problem it corresponds to violated clauses .",
    "the mathematical criterion is the same .",
    "the local stochastic algorithm works in a certain parameter range , but outside this range it fails .",
    "the paradise is never reached for a propensity parameter @xmath8 , independently of @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the solution of the @xmath0xs problem is never found if the dilution parameter is larger than @xmath27 , and the rws algorithm needs an exponentially long time already for @xmath30 , with @xmath447 .",
    "+ we generalized the rws algorithm , usually chosen for solving the @xmath0-sat ( @xmath0s ) problem as well as the @xmath0xs problem , to include a parameter @xmath2 that played formerly the role of the propensity parameter in the social dynamics ( @xmath2rws ) .",
    "the effect of this parameter is a bias towards the solution so that @xmath25 , the threshold between a linear and an exponential time for solving the problem , becomes a function of @xmath2 .",
    "problems for which the @xmath2rws algorithm needed exponentially long for @xmath23 , now become solvable within a time that grows less than logarithmically in the system size for @xmath145 and less than power - like in the system size for @xmath143 . along with the bias",
    "goes an exploration of solution space that has on average a smaller hamming distance between different solutions than in the case of the @xmath448rws algorithm that was formerly considered @xcite .",
    "+   + our paper has illustrated that the reduction of frustration may be the driving force in common to a number of dynamical systems .",
    "so far we were concerned about `` artificial '' systems like social systems and satisfiability problems .",
    "it would be interesting to search for natural networks whose evolution was determined by the goal of reducing the frustration , not necessarily to zero degree , but to a low degree at least .",
