    "the rabi model describes a two - level system interacting with a single - mode bosonic field @xcite .",
    "it plays a fundamental role in quantum optics @xcite , quantum information @xcite , and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "although it has been intensively explored , only in recent years has the integrability of this model been formulated @xcite . however , this analytic achievement is not the end of the study on this model , oppositely , it has triggered more theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the rabi model has been experimentally simulated in optical waveguide @xcite , superconducting circuit system @xcite , and solid - state semiconductor@xcite , which provides a perfect test bed to explore the physics of light - matter interaction in the deep strong coupling regime .",
    "another significance of the analytic achievement is that it supplies some insight to understand the involved physics , e.g. , the vacuum induced berry phase @xcite , and the quantum phase transition in the related multi - model rabi model , i.e. , the spin - boson model @xcite , for which an exact solution is quite difficult to obtain , and a well - established approximate method is desirable .    for decades of study on the rabi model , besides the numerical treatment @xcite , there exist many approximate analytic methods @xcite .",
    "the most famous approximation is the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite .",
    "working in the near - resonance and weak - coupling regime , the rwa neglects the counter - rotating terms in the interaction and results in the jaynes - cummings ( j - c ) model @xcite .",
    "it has served as a basic starting point in understanding many quantum phenomena involved in light - matter interaction @xcite , because most of the practical quantum optical experiments work in the weak coupling regime @xcite . however , in circuit quantum electrodynamics system , the neglected counter - rotating term becomes important due to the strong @xcite or the ultra - strong coupling @xcite between the bosonic field and the two - level system . to treat the strong coupling , irish _",
    "@xcite proposed an adiabatic approximation ( aa ) in the limit that the frequency of the field is much larger than the one of the two - level system . after working in the displaced oscillator basis",
    ", it takes the frequency of the two - level system as perturbation and results in a truncated hamiltonian with the interaction effects collected in a renormalization factor to the frequency of the two - level system . in 2007",
    "@xcite , the aa was improved by considering the rwa - type interaction in the reformulated hamiltonian in the displaced oscillator basis .",
    "this scheme was named as generalized rwa ( grwa ) .",
    "although the grwa works well in a quite broad parameter regime , especially in the strong coupling regime , it does not work well in the weak coupling regime , especially for the positive detuning case .",
    "in addition , the mean photon number predicted by the grwa is independent of the frequency of the two - level system , which is actually not true . as an improvement , a generalized variational method ( gvm ) @xcite has been introduced , where the displacement of the displaced oscillator basis is determined by minimizing the ground state energy .",
    "indeed , the gvm evidently improves the grwa in weak coupling regime with positive detuning , and yields a frequency dependent ground state mean photon number .",
    "however , for strong coupling and intermediate coupling regimes , the gvm is no longer applicable .",
    "moreover the gvm is limited to the ground state .",
    "obviously , the merit of the grwa and the aa comes from the introduction of the displaced oscillator basis , which captures the essential physics in the large coupling regime .",
    "however , its disadvantage lies in fixing the displacement , which leads to a frequency independent mean photon number of the obtained ground state . on the contrary",
    ", the gvm frees the displacement , but it does not introduce the displaced oscillator basis and has been excessively simplified in the analytic treatment . in the present work ,",
    "we combine the merits of the grwa and the gvm to obtain a novel analytic method .",
    "we start from the grwa formula but further introduce a mean photon number dependent variational method to determine the displacement . as a result ,",
    "our approximation method is applicable in both weak and strong coupling regimes . in the weak coupling regime",
    ", it recovers the result of the gvm and in the strong coupling regime it recovers the grwa . in the intermediate coupling",
    ", it provides a natural crossover from the gvm to the grwa .",
    "this variational method is not only valid for the ground state , but also for the excited states . to show the merit of the our method , we focus on the energy spectrum and mean photon number of the rabi model and compare the result with that obtained by the gvm and the grwa , taking the exact numerical result as a benchmark .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section_am ] we introduce the rabi model and give a review to the previous approximate methods for self containing and also for convenience of later discussions . in sec .",
    "[ section_ca ] we present our method and make some detailed comparisons with the results obtained by the previous methods .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ section_con ] is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the rabi model reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the annihilation and creation operators of the quantized single - mode bosonic field with frequency @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the pauli matrix for the two - level system with level splitting @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the transition operators between the two levels , and @xmath7 is the coupling strength . here ,",
    "for convenience of comparison we follow the notations in ref.@xcite to use spin - flipping @xmath8 for the level - splitting term instead of @xmath9 commonly used in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "however , these two notations can be transformed into each other by a rotation on the two - level system . according to the tuning relationship between the two - level system and the field , the model takes three cases : resonance ( @xmath10 ) , positive detuning ( @xmath11 ) and negative detuning ( @xmath12 ) . throughout the paper",
    "we take @xmath5 as unit of energy .",
    "essentially , the existing approximate methods can be formulated in two ways : one is to truncate eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) into j - c - like exactly solvable form , and the other is to expand eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) on a proper basis and then truncate the obtained matrix into the block - diagonal form . in the following , we reformulate these approximations in the two ways in order to compare their performance .",
    "1 .   rwa : neglecting the counter - rotating terms @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) yields the rwa hamiltonian @xmath14 this is the j - c hamiltonian @xcite , which is exactly solvable .",
    "its eigen solution reads @xmath15 with the ground eigen - energy @xmath16 , which is just the j - c energy ladder @xcite .",
    "aa : performing a unitary transformation @xmath17 with @xmath18 to eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) , one obtains @xmath19 with @xcite @xmath20 here @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 $ ] , and + @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the associated laguerre polynomial ( see appendix a ) . in the small @xmath5 case[@xmath25 , keeping only the zero - th order term of @xmath1 and @xmath26 in @xmath27 is a good approximation , which leads to @xmath28 whose eigensolution can be evaluated readily as @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the eigenstates of @xmath4 and @xmath31 being the fock state .",
    "after the inverse transformation , through representing the @xmath30 by the original @xmath32 basis , one gets the eigen - state under the aa : @xmath33 3 .",
    "grwa : going beyond the aa , one further considers the zeroth order term in g(@xmath34 ) involving one - excitation terms . only considering the  energy - conserving \" one - excitation terms , one arrives at the grwa hamiltonian @xcite @xmath35.\\ ] ] on the basis of @xmath36 , eq . is block - diagonalized with @xmath37 subblocks @xmath38 which gives a pair of eigen - vectors @xmath39 .",
    "the off - diagonal entries are defined by @xmath40 thus , the eigenstates of eq .",
    "( [ hgrwa ] ) read as @xmath41 ) are obtained by the inverse transformation : @xmath42 while the ground state @xmath43 is the same as that of aa .",
    "gvm : different from the above two methods , the parameter @xmath34 here is not fixed but is optimized by minimizing the ground - state energy @xcite @xmath44 which results in the equation to determine @xmath34 as @xmath45 . since it can not be solved analytically , zhang _",
    "@xcite took the following approximate solution @xmath46    below we address the conditions under which the above methods work well .",
    "the rwa is valid in the very weak coupling regime ( @xmath47 ) and under the near - resonance ( @xmath48 ) conditions . beyond the usual strong coupling regime , namely , in the strong coupling limit , the rwa is no longer valid but the aa shows its advantage . for either large @xmath49 or large @xmath7 ,",
    "the term of displaced oscillator is dominant in and the @xmath5 terms can be treated as perturbation .",
    "thus the validity of the aa lies in strong coupling limit ( @xmath50 ) or negative detuning ( @xmath51 ) regime .",
    "because the grwa further keeps all one - excitation  energy - conserving \" terms unincorporated in the aa , its applicable range for the excited states is extended to the regime that covers those of both rwa and aa , which is nearly the whole parameter regime .",
    "the reason can be due to  the fundamental similarity between the standard rwa and aa model : both involved calculating the energy splitting due to an interaction between two otherwise degenerate basis states \" , as clearly stated in ref .",
    "however , the validity regime of the grwa could be further broadened if the following aspects can be properly treated .",
    "first , the ground - state energy of the grwa is the same as the aa , no improvement has been obtained .",
    "second , its energy spectrum requires a more accurate calculation for small ratio of @xmath52 in the weak coupling regime , especially for the ground state .",
    "third , it predicts an incorrect @xmath5-independent mean photon number due to the fixed @xmath34 .",
    "the gvm improves the accuracy of the ground - state energy and its mean photon number behavior captures the @xmath5-dependent property in the weak coupling regime , especially for the positive detuning case .",
    "however , since an oversimplified analytic treatment has been applied , the results of the gvm becomes even worse than the grwa in the strong coupling limit regime .",
    "truncating the hamiltonian in aa and grwa can be understood in an alternative way by discarding the remote off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian matrix on certain basis @xcite .",
    "here we reformulate the aa and the grwa based on this idea .    choosing the basis @xmath53 with @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . discarding the remote off - diagonal elements",
    "leads to a @xmath58 block - diagonal matrix @xmath59 by diagonalizing eq .",
    "( [ aa_matrix_aa ] ) , one finds the eigen solution @xmath60 which matches well with eq .",
    "( [ aa_basis_oldpre ] ) obtained under the aa .",
    "irish _ et al .",
    "_ further used the eigenstates in eq .",
    "( [ wave_aa ] ) as basis to expand the hamiltonian ( [ rabi ] ) , which reads @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "then dropping the remote off - diagonal matrix elements gives rise to @xmath63 based on this form , the energy spectra and the eigenstates can be readily solved , which are consistent with those obtained under the grwa , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ ddsf ] ) .",
    "from the above analysis on the previous approximations , we can see that truncating the hamiltonian matrix into block - diagonalized form in a completed orthogonal basis is equivalent to truncating the hamiltonian operator expansions .",
    "the better a basis is chosen , the more information an approximation obtains . moreover , a proper basis can even be considered as an approximate state . first , let us focus on the ground state .",
    "for the existing approximate methods , the ground state takes the following form @xmath64 are the coherent states . for the aa / grwa , @xmath54 , while for the gvm , @xmath34 is approximately given by eq .",
    "( [ gvm_lambda ] ) .",
    "this motivates us to take eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) as our trial state but completely free the parameter @xmath34 . the reasons for taking the form of eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) as our trial state are as follows .",
    "on one hand , it is seen that eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) can reproduce the previous known results from different approximations like aa / grwa and gvm . in particular ,",
    "the irish s scheme is valid in nearly the whole coupling regime . on the other hand",
    ", it is motivated from the competition nature between the displaced oscillator and spin - flipping in the model .",
    "it is noticed that if the spin - flipping term @xmath65 is neglected , the model reduces to a displaced oscillator hamiltonian with two degenerated ground states @xmath66 and @xmath67 . considering an infinitesimal spin - flipping ,",
    "the degeneracy is lifted and their linear combination , namely , @xmath68 is just the trial state eq . with @xmath54 . when increasing the spin - flipping , the competition between the displaced oscillator and the spin - flipping motivates us to free the @xmath34 as a variational parameter .",
    "in addition , @xmath69 is also eigenstate of parity operator @xmath70 , which commutes with the model hamiltonian .",
    "thus this approximate ground state has a definite parity . with the assumed ground state eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) , the energy and the mean photon number of the ground state is easy to obtain : @xmath71    obviously , the parameter @xmath34 is optimal if the projection @xmath72 is exactly equal to one , where @xmath73 is the exact ground state .",
    "unfortunately , a simple expression of @xmath73 is unknown ( though a series expression of @xmath73 can be given but it is quite useless due to the infinite series form ) .",
    "we here adopt an approximate but accurate enough form for @xmath73 .",
    "note that a unitary transformation @xmath74 can recast @xmath69 to @xmath75 , which can be regarded as the zero - th order approximation for @xmath76 .",
    "taking the complete orthogonal basis of @xmath77 into consideration , we can construct the perturbative corrections of @xmath78 .",
    "for perturbative calculation , we choose the basis of aa @xmath79 to be the complete orthogonal basis of @xmath77 .",
    "note that it should work better to choose a more accurate basis , e.g. , the grwa basis , to expand the perturbation .",
    "but here , the choice of the aa or the grwa basis makes little difference in the ground state calculation . according to perturbation theory ,",
    "we can expand @xmath78 to the first order of the perturbation as @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "note that the primed summation excludes the ground state itself with the label @xmath84 , and @xmath85 will vanish if state @xmath36 has a different parity from @xmath86",
    ". then we can calculate @xmath87 for given @xmath88 and @xmath7 , if @xmath89 is minimized by choosing optimal @xmath34 , then the obtained @xmath69 would be optimal ground state .",
    "this process can be done numerically .    before presenting the numerical results ,",
    "it is useful to discuss some limit cases analytically .",

    "@xmath7 is much larger than @xmath5 , the two - level splitting @xmath65 in eq .",

    "thus our method is valid in whole coupling regime with not sufficiently small frequency of the bosonic field . in the small limit of the frequency of the bosonic field , both our method and the existing aa / grwa and gvm work no longer well , which indicates that the position - displaced oscillator basis is no longer a good trial state and one should explore new starting point in this regime .",
    "although most variational methods limit to the ground state , our variational scheme can be also applied to the excited states . for the excited states ,",
    "the deviation of the grwa in the weak coupling regime is still considerable .",
    "in contrast , the validity of our scheme for the whole coupling regime still remains .",
    "the quantitative deviation of the grwa energy in the weak coupling regime and the qualitative missing of concave feature for the mean photon number in the grwa are well rectified in our scheme .    in short",
    ", our variational scheme efficiently improves several previous widely - used approximations such as the aa , the grwa and the gvm , with better qualitative and quantitative descriptions on the physics of the model . despite that the integrability and exactly analytical expressions of energy spectra have been obtained for the rabi model in ref.@xcite , series expansion form of its wavefunction",
    "is still inconvenient to calculate the physical variables in the model . on the contrary ,",
    "our method directly starts from the wavefunction assumption and emphasizes its physics meaning .",
    "for example , the ground state form of our wavefunction is not only directly related the mean photon number but also useful for discussion of nonclassical states preparation @xcite . in particular",
    ", our method to evaluate properties of the ground state and the low excited states might be applicable to the multi - mode rabi model , i.e. , the so - called spin - boson model , where a novel quantum phase transition characterized by the low level energies is intensively studied recently @xcite .",
