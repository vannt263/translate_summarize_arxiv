    "an improved model for the distribution of errors for gamma - ray burst ( grb ) locations obtained with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) is presented .",
    "the error model should aid in using the batse locations in projects such as searching for counterparts and searching for evidence of repetition and clustering , including gravitational lensing .",
    "most of the analysis applies to the 4br catalog ( paciesas et al .",
    "1998 ) , which has some revised locations compared to earlier catalogs , including the initial 4b catalog ( paciesas et al . 1997 ) , which was released electronically and on cdrom .",
    "summary results are presented for earlier catalogs .",
    "the batse instrument consists of eight modules located on the corners of the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) .",
    "each module contains a large area detector ( lad ) , consisting of a 1.27 cm thick by 50.8 cm diameter nai crystal viewed by three photomultiplier tubes .",
    "each lad has an approximately cosine response .",
    "grb locations are determined with the program locburst by modeling the responses of either four or six detectors as a function of assumed source location , intensity and spectrum ( pendleton et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the detector response model is based upon monte carlo photon propagation , laboratory measurements and space observations .",
    "it includes scattering from nearby spacecraft structures and from the earth s atmosphere ( pendleton et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "the error models presented in this paper are obtained empirically by statistical comparison of batse locations with locations obtained by other techniques .",
    "the ideal reference dataset would have many locations to enable a good statistical comparison and would consist of locations with errors significantly smaller than the batse errors so that all discrepancies could be attributed to batse . if such a dataset existed , there would probably be little interest in the batse locations .",
    "the reference set we use is the locations of the interplanetary network ( ipn ) supplements to the batse 4br catalog ( hurley et al .",
    "1998a , b ; laros et al .",
    "1997,1998 ; hurley 1998 ) .",
    "although this dataset is large , most of the ipn locations are highly accurate only in one dimension .",
    "the goal is an improved model of the error distribution of batse grb locations .",
    "the error model is a probability density function @xmath0 defined on the sphere .",
    "a probability density function can have any nonnegative value ; integrating @xmath0 with respect to solid angle element @xmath1 over any solid angle region @xmath2 yields the probability @xmath3 ( between 0 and 1 ) that the true location is in the region @xmath2 .",
    "a portion of the errors originates from the poisson fluctuations of the detected counts .",
    "these fluctuations are propagated into an estimated statistical uncertainty @xmath4 by the program locburst .",
    "the locations are found by locburst by @xmath5-minimization , and @xmath4 is calculated as the radius of the spherical small circle with the same area as the 68% confidence ellipse obtained from the hessian matrix of derivatives of @xmath5 ( pendleton et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this paper",
    "we assume that the total error distribution is azimuthally symmetric .",
    "the value of @xmath4 for each grb is listed in the 4br catalog ( paciesas et al .",
    "1998 ) , or , for bursts with unchanged locations , in the 3b catalog ( meegan et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we attribute the difference between the total error @xmath6 and the statistical uncertainty @xmath4 to a systematic error @xmath7 .",
    "possible sources of systematic errors include : inaccuracies in the assignment of energies to channel boundaries , inaccuracies in the deadtime correction of high count rates , the approximations of the statistical and total error boxes as circles , inaccuracies in the detector response model as a function of photon energy or direction , including inaccuracies in the model of scattering from the spacecraft and the earth s atmosphere , deviations of the actual grb spectra from the power law assumed in most cases , and inaccuracies in background subtraction .    the first published batse catalog , the 1b catalog ( fishman et al .",
    "1994 ) , had 260 grbs .",
    "the error estimate was based on eleven events with small error boxes from ipn data . a root - mean - square difference between the actual batse - ipn separations and the batse statistical uncertainties",
    "estimated a systematic error of @xmath8 ( fishman et al .",
    "the 3b catalog ( meegan et al . 1996 ) introduced an improved location algorithm .",
    "the analysis of the 3b location errors expanded the reference dataset to include 38 locations obtained with cgro / comptel or watch in addition to 12 ipn locations .",
    "the systematic error @xmath7 was estimated to be @xmath9 from the root - mean - square difference between the actual separations to these 50 reference locations and the batse statistical uncertainties .",
    "the total errors of the comptel or watch locations are not much smaller than the batse errors ; in this situation a very good understanding of the errors of the reference locations is required , otherwise the portion of the location discrepancies due to batse may be miscalculated .",
    "an overestimation of the comptel or watch location errors may have caused the batse systematic error to be somewhat underestimated .",
    "in addition , we show that the batse error distribution is not well characterized by a single - valued systematic error so that various techniques of estimating a single systematic error yield different values ( see , e.g. , pendleton et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we term the simple error model specified in the 3b paper ( meegan et al .",
    "1996 ) , that the total error @xmath6 is formed by adding the statistical uncertainty @xmath4 and a systematic error @xmath7 of @xmath9 in quadrature , the `` minimal '' model .",
    "a rough rule of thumb learned in this analysis is that with @xmath10 reference locations , models with up to @xmath11 parameters may be fit . exceeding this empirical limit",
    "typically results in models difficult or impossible to fit , and , if a fit is obtained , nonsense parameter values .",
    "there are only about 20 ` point ' locations available from ipn data , but by using a more sophisticated analysis method ( graziani and lamb 1996 ) , the several hundred single annuli in the ipn supplements may be used to constrain the batse location error distribution .",
    "formerly representations of the systematic error were limited to using a single parameter ; considerably more complicated error models can now be tested .",
    "the ipn location technique compares the arrival times of the grb wavefront at widely separated instruments , thereby determining the angles the plane wave makes with the vectors connecting each pair of instruments ( hurley et al .",
    "1998a ) . with only one pair of spacecraft ,",
    "one angle is determined , and the error region is an annulus .",
    "this is the typical case during the time period of the 4b catalog .",
    "ideally , three or more spacecraft have separations of inter - planetary scale , multiple annuli are found , and their intersections give a small error box .",
    "the ipn supplements to the 4br catalog contains 458 annuli for 412 grbs . of these 412 grbs ,",
    "366 were observed by only one deep - space instrument , _ ulysses _ ( hurley et al .",
    "1998a , b ) .",
    "the remaining 46 grbs were observed by _",
    "ulysses _ and another deep - space instrument such as pioneer venus orbiter or mars observer ( laros et al .",
    "1997,1998 ) .",
    "measurements of the actual separations @xmath12 are available for the few cases with small error boxes from intersecting ipn annuli . for the cases for which only single annuli are available ,",
    "the batse - ipn separations are characterized by the distances of closest approach @xmath13 of the annuli to the batse locations ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "our analysis approach assumes that the reference locations are effectively points or lines compared to the batse locations , an assumption which is fulfilled by eliminating all annuli with @xmath14 widths exceeding @xmath9 and eliminating @xmath14 error boxes with any corner - to - corner dimension exceeding @xmath9 . because there are few ipn annuli with large widths , decreasing or increasing the 1.6@xmath15 requirement by a factor of two leads to only small changes in the number of annuli included in the comparison sample and negligible changes in the results .",
    "we convert the annuli to circles on the sphere , or their intersections to points , by using the circle in the middle of each annulus .",
    "each pair of annuli has two intersections  we assume that the intersection closest to the batse location is the true location . many of the intersecting annuli create long error boxes which are rejected by the requirement that no dimension exceed @xmath16 , in which case we keep only the narrowest annulus .",
    "such error boxes are common during the time period of the 4br catalog because frequently several of the spacecraft of the third interplanetary network have been close in space .",
    "the vectors connecting each pair of spacecraft define the centers of the annuli , and with some spacecraft in similar directions , these vectors are typically close to parallel .",
    "this leads to ` grazing ' intersections of the annuli and long error boxes .",
    "( an additional consequence of grazing intersections is that a small error in one annulus will move the intersection a comparatively large distance ) . after removing the wide annuli and large error boxes ,",
    "430 annuli for 411 grbs remain . for grbs with intersecting annuli meeting our criteria and therefore with a measurement of @xmath12",
    ", we do not use the two measurements of @xmath13 that could be obtained from the individual annuli , thereby ensuring the independence of all the @xmath12 and @xmath13 measurements .",
    "these criteria yield a reference dataset with 19 measurements of @xmath12 and 392 measurements of @xmath13 .",
    "the 411 grbs with ipn locations meeting our criteria represent 25% of the 1637 grbs of the 4br catalog .",
    "the relative sensitivities of batse and the deep - space instruments of the third interplanetary network are largely determined by their effective areas and by their backgrounds .",
    "each batse lad has an effective area of 2025 @xmath17 , compared to , for example , a projected area of 20  @xmath17 for _ ulysses_. the differences in sensitivities are not as great as the comparisons of areas would indicate because the deep - space instruments have lower and more stable backgrounds .",
    "fig .  2 compares the properties of the bursts of the 4br catalog with the bursts of the ipn supplements to the 4br catalog .",
    "the ipn supplements sample almost the entire range of peak fluxes on the 64  ms timescale of the 4br catalog , albeit with emphasis on the bright bursts . in terms of fluence ,",
    "the ipn supplements have a strong bias towards bright bursts , with only rare events below @xmath18 erg @xmath19 having ipn annuli .",
    "there is a close correlation between burst fluence and batse @xmath4 , so a similar effect is seen in the distributions of @xmath4 .",
    "if many ` point ' reference locations were available , a histogram of the observed separations @xmath12 between the batse locations and the reference locations would provide a good representation of the probability distribution of batse errors .",
    "because most of the reference locations from the ipn supplements are single annuli , insufficient information exists for such a simple approach .",
    "instead the error function @xmath20 is determined by comparing models for @xmath20 and optimizing their parameters using the entire dataset of @xmath12 and @xmath13 measurements .    a bayesian analysis very similar to that of graziani and lamb ( 1996 )",
    "is used to identify the best error model .",
    "the bayesian approach identifies the likelihood function as the correct ` merit ' function ( sivia 1996 ) .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath21 is simply the product of the probability density functions @xmath0 evaluated at each observed value of @xmath12 for bursts @xmath22 with intersecting annuli and at each observed value of @xmath13 for bursts @xmath23 with single annuli : @xmath24 the probability density function @xmath25 used for the single annuli cases is analytically derived from @xmath26 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the likelihood function identified by the bayesian method specifies how measurements of differing nature ( intersecting vs. single annuli ) are to be combined in the analysis . while eq .",
    "1 shows the likelihood @xmath21 as a function of the observations , @xmath21 is also , through the functions @xmath26 and @xmath25 , a function of the error model and its parameters . for a particular error model ,",
    "the best - fit parameters are obtained by maximizing the likelihood .",
    "an additional consideration arises in comparing models : a model with more parameters than another must be penalized because it has greater ability to match the data whether or not it is correct . the bayesian approach specifies how this must be done : each model is penalized by an occam s factor @xmath27 . assuming that prior to examining the data one expects parameter @xmath28 to be in the range @xmath29 to @xmath30 and that the likelihood function is approximately gaussian , these factors are , per parameter @xmath28 ( sivia 1996 ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the uncertainty on @xmath28 obtained from the fit .",
    "the overall occam s factor @xmath27 is the product of the @xmath33 and penalizes a model for obtaining a better fit by using adjustable parameters , with a greater penalty ( smaller @xmath27 ) when the parameters have larger possible prior ranges .",
    "the final consideration is that one might have prior preferences for particular models from earlier analyses or judgments .",
    "these preferences can be represented as prior probabilities for each model @xmath34 .",
    "combining these considerations , the odds ratio @xmath35 specifies the factor by which one should prefer model b over model a : @xmath36 to avoid suspicions that our beliefs have created the results , we equate all prior probabilities so that the first factor in eq .  3 cancels .",
    "many of the models have common parameters so that some of the occam s factors @xmath33 also cancel . for most of the model comparisons",
    "the likelihood ratios are so large that no reasonable priors nor occam s factors @xmath27 could alter which model is identified as best .",
    "further discussion of bayesian methodology , model fitting and comparison are given by sivia ( 1996 ) and loredo ( 1990 ) .    instead of listing the odds",
    "ratios @xmath37 for every combination of models  a and  b , we list what we call odds factors @xmath38 for each model  m. the odds factors @xmath38 are proportional to @xmath39 by a factor which is the same for each model , therefore the odds ratios @xmath37 can be found by forming the ratio of the factors @xmath40 and @xmath41 , or by differencing their logarithms ( tables 2 and 5 ) .",
    "the likelihoods and parameter uncertainties are also listed ( tables 2 and 3 ) so that others can calculate odds ratios based upon their priors .    while the quantitative analysis is done with unbinned data using likelihood , we prefer to depict the data and models with histograms ( fig . 35 , 7 & 9 ) .",
    "in order to present the results in a consistent manner , the data and models are binned using the total errors of the minimal model , @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "we define the total error as the quadratic sum of the statistical uncertainty @xmath4 ( as listed in the 4br catalog ) and a systematic error : @xmath44    our error models are based on the fisher probability density function @xmath45 , which has been called the gaussian distribution on the sphere : @xmath46 where @xmath12 is the angle between the measured and true location ( fisher et al .",
    "the first convenience of this distribution is that it is normalized on the sphere and that the ` volume ' element is clearly solid angle @xmath1 .",
    "the distribution also has convenient analytic properties ; in the small angle approximation it reduces to the gaussian distribution .",
    "an algorithm to simulate random locations from a fisher distribution is given by fisher et al .",
    "( 1987 ) .",
    "the probability @xmath3 of the true location lying in a region of solid angle @xmath2 is found by integrating the probability density function @xmath0 : @xmath47 specializing to the probability of the true location being in the ring @xmath48 , eq .",
    "6 becomes @xmath49    the parameter @xmath50 is termed the concentration parameter .",
    "batse grb location errors have traditionally been specified in terms of @xmath51 , which has been defined by the batse team as the radius of the circle with the same area as the 68% confidence ellipse . assuming the error box to be circular , and setting @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 in eq .  7 , one obtains , for @xmath6 in _ radians _ and for @xmath6 small ( @xmath55 ) : @xmath56    models more complicated than a fisher distribution are tested .",
    "the first method of building more complicated models is to make @xmath7 a function of either intrinsic burst properties or of instrumental factors which might influence the quality of locations .",
    "the second way in which more complicated models are formed is to sum two fisher distributions with different values of @xmath7 : @xmath57 in this case , for each burst , the values of the two total location errors @xmath58 are calculated from the statistical uncertainties @xmath4 listed in the catalog and the model values @xmath59 ( for @xmath60 ) : @xmath61    for the single annulus cases , the probability density function @xmath62 is analytically derived from the probability density function @xmath20 ( see appendix ) . since @xmath63 ( see fig .  1 ) , @xmath64 .",

    "1996 ) was determined by a root - mean - square comparison of the observed separations with the combination of the batse statistical uncertainties and the known errors of the reference locations .",
    "the 3b catalog warned that some locations might be substantially worse than average and that the error distribution might have a non - gaussian tail .",

    "we conclude that the bilateral asymmetries of the spacecraft do not create bilateral asymmetries in location quality .",

    "this is not a problem because these three models are based upon the same fundamental ideas ( core - plus - tail distribution and datatype dependence ) and make nearly identical predictions for location errors .",
    "reasons to prefer model  10 are that it seems very plausible that the error distribution of both cont and non - cont locations should be best - fit with a core - plus - tail model and there is no reason that the fractions and tail systematic errors must be identical .",
    "( this assertion of reasonableness might be termed a `` prior '' , but we chose not to quantify our inclination . )",
    "however , we have recommended model  33 because it has the best odds ratio and is simpler than models  10 and 12 ; in any case these three models provide very similar predictions .",
    "the parameter values of the models are also slightly changed from the preliminary analysis .",
    "the differences between the analyses are due to improvements in the ipn locations between the preliminary data releases and the published values , improvements in the batse locations between the 4b and 4br catalog ( paciesas et al .",
    "1998 ) ( also see  3.3 ) and better rejection of long ipn error boxes .",

    "1996 ) ( the 4br catalog did not yet exist ) and restricted the analysis to events with single annuli .",
    "they neglected all of the events with @xmath12 measurements in order to avoid any locations that might have been used to optimize the location program locburst .",
    "twelve grbs with @xmath12-values were used to identify which proposed algorithmic improvements were worth implementing ( pendleton et al .",
    "all location algorithm parameter values were determined from laboratory measurements , in - orbit observations of the crab nebula and pulsar and from monte carlo simulations ",
    "none were optimized using grb measurements .",
    "we know of no reason to exclude all @xmath12 measurements and judge that there is little ` circularity ' in using the @xmath12 measurements of the twelve ` study ' bursts . in any case , excluding the data for these twelve events has negligible effects on the results .",
    "the reasons that are probably most important in explaining the difference between our results and those of graziani and lamb ( 1996 ) are the models tested and revisions to the preliminary ipn data ( hurley et al .",
    "1998a ) . using the original 3b batse data and the data selections of graziani and lamb ( i.e. , excluding bursts with @xmath12 measurements ) , but using the finalized ipn data , model  2 is favored over model  4 by an odds ratio of 400 . adding the @xmath12 measurements for all except the twelve ` study ' bursts , the odds ratio becomes 4700 .",
    "unlike graziani and lamb , we conclude that there is no evidence for a direct dependence of batse systematic location errors on burst intensity .    because the ipn supplement emphasizes relatively bright batse bursts ( fig .",
    "2 ) , it is difficult to use ipn data to test the locations of faint bursts .",
    "graziani and lamb ( 1996 ) used extrapolations of models  4 and  8 to argue that faint batse bursts have large systematic errors , e.g. , @xmath126 for bursts with @xmath127 , and that the 3b catalog had larger systematic errors for faint bursts than the 1b catalog . because our analysis finds no evidence that @xmath7 directly depends on burst intensity",
    ", we consider such extrapolations unjustified .",
    "a more direct test of the location accuracy of weak bursts can be made using fluctuations from cygnus x-1 which triggered batse .",
    "these fluctuations are almost always near the trigger threshold .",
    "the spectra of these fluctuations are similar to grbs in the energy range ( 50300 kev ) used for determining locations , but softer at higher energies . because of the reduced flux above the energy range used for burst locations , the scattering model is less important for locating cygnus x-1 than for grbs",
    "; however , any intensity dependence of scattering other than the obvious proportionality is implausible .",
    "thirty - nine such events had an average statistical uncertainty @xmath4 of @xmath128 , but an average separation from the true location of only @xmath129 , implying a 95% confidence upper - limit on @xmath7 of @xmath130 ( meegan et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "there is , however , the possibility of a weak _ indirect _ correlation of @xmath7 with burst intensity .",
    "the fraction of events located using cont data decreases with decreasing burst intensity ( fig .",
    "the reasons for this trend are correlations between the optimum batse datatype for a location , grb duration , and @xmath4 : short events are best located with datatypes other than cont to avoid adding background intervals to the burst data ; additionally short events typically have low fluences and thus larger values of @xmath4 . in model  33",
    "the only difference between locations obtained using cont data and other locations is the value of the core systematic error .",
    "coupled with the correlation between datatype and intensity , this datatype dependence of model  33 implies that a larger fraction of weak bursts have a core systematic error of @xmath131 instead of @xmath132 .",
    "this difference is unimportant for bursts with large values of @xmath4 .",
    "the systematic error is not a direct function of the statistical uncertainty and therefore does not extrapolate to large values for faint bursts .",
    "it seems plausible that the improvement of the models with direct intensity dependencies ( models  4 and  8) over single - parameter models ( 0  or  1 ) is due to two correlations : the correlation between intensity and datatype used for the location and the probable correlation between datatype and systematic error .",
    "however , this may not be be the case since a model in which @xmath7 has no dependence on any burst property ( model  2 ) is favored over model  4 by a large odds ratio .",
    "the locations of the previous batse catalogs , 1b ( fishman et al .",
    "1994 ) , 2b ( meegan et al .",
    "1994 ) , 3b ( meegan et al . 1995 ) , and 4b ( paciesas et al .",
    "1997 ) are superseded by the revised locations of the 4br catalog ( paciesas et al .",
    "1998 ) , with the exception that bursts of the 3b catalog which are not listed in the 4br catalog paper have unaltered locations which are considered to be 4br locations .",
    "key events affecting the quality of the locations were the deterioration of the data availability starting at the end of the 1b catalog due to the failure of the tape recorders on - board cgro , a substantial recovery of data availability at the end of the 2b catalog due to flight software improvements , and a major improvement in the location algorithm effective with the publication of the 3b catalog ( at which time all locations were revised ) . a lesser algorithmic improvement is implemented with the publication of the 4br catalog ( paciesas et al .",
    "1998 ) , in which 208 locations are changed from the original 4b catalog .",
    "table  6 presents analyses of these catalogs for historical interest and to aid in assessing work based upon these catalogs .",
    "since the purpose is to understand batse location errors , in all cases the current ipn supplement data are used rather than the preliminary ipn data available at the time of the publication of a particular batse catalog . only models  1 and  2",
    "are shown because most of the catalogs are too small to support reliable analysis of models with more than about 3 parameters .",
    "the odds ratios favor model  2 over model  1 by factors ranging from 4 to @xmath133 .",
    "the major algorithmic upgrade of locburst can be seen in the comparison of the parameter values for the original 2b and 3b catalogs , or between the original 2b catalog and the equivalent subset of the 4br catalog .",
    "the minor algorithmic improvement between the 4b and 4br catalogs is not apparent in table  6 , which is not surprising since only 13% of the locations were altered , mostly modestly .",
    "a more direct comparison validates the algorithmic upgrade used for the 4br catalog ( paciesas et al .",
    "there is no evidence in the parameter values for subsets of the 4br catalog for any time dependence of location quality , especially considering that the parameter values of model  2 are correlated . in particular , the locations obtained during the period of lesser - quality data ( 2b@xmath1341b ) have error model parameters consistent with the other time periods .",
