    "<S> @xcite is that it applies to _ generic _ graphs and not only to uniformly hyperbolic systems where all pos share the same lyapunov exponent .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a graph with @xmath10 vertices and @xmath11 directed bonds . </S>",

    "<S> these contributions are collected in the diagonal approximation to the form factor @xmath59 which reproduces the linear term in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we also neglected self - retracing orbits @xmath61 , since they represent an exponentially small fraction as @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is the purpose of this letter to go beyond the diagonal approximation and investigate the contribution of pairs of orbits which differ from each other at one self - intersection . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unfoldings8orbit ] : ( i ) is the example of two loops intersecting at a vertex @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) shows the four orbits which traverse each of the two loops once and thus have the same length . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows between these orbits indicate the possible pairs whose contribution should be counted in ( [ posum ] ) ; the dashed arrows correspond to pairs already counted in the diagonal approximation and the solid arrows to those that we have to sum here .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the loop with unchanged orientation must not be time - reversal invariant ( self - retracing ) , e.  g.  the bottom orbits are excluded . ]    the two orbits in any pair that is of interest to us differ in the orientation along one of the cycles from vertex @xmath62 to @xmath62 . to count such pairs </S>",
    "<S> we define a `` standard '' symbolic code for the orbits of the pair @xmath63=[\\alpha , l_1,\\alpha , l_2]$ ] and @xmath64 $ ] , where @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath66 $ ] represent sequences of @xmath67 and @xmath68 vertices , respectively , and @xmath69 $ ] stands for the reversal of the sequence @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , a pair can also be specified by the code of orbit @xmath52 and the position @xmath71 of the second occurrence of @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the standard code for the pair of top right and bottom right orbits of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unfoldings8orbit](ii ) is @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath73 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the orbit @xmath52 will in general contain more than one self - intersection . </S>",
    "<S> it is the pair @xmath74 which singles out the particular one at @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the code for the pair @xmath74 is not yet unique . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the pair shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sticky_orbit ] ( i ) has two possible codes : @xmath75,\\     q=[\\alpha,\\beta , a , b,\\beta,\\alpha , d , c ] & & \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> moreover we assume ( ii ) @xmath80 since otherwise @xmath81 such that the orbit pair was already counted in the diagonal approximation . augmented with the conditions ( i ) , </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the standard code is a unique representation of all orbit pairs we have to count . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have the contribution of such orbits to the form factor @xmath82 where the sum is over @xmath83 $ ] ( in analogy to the notation of fig .  [ fig : unfoldings8orbit ] we write @xmath84 for @xmath85 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this sum is subject to the restriction @xmath86 indicated by a prime and also to all restrictions implied by the connectivity of the graph ( for some sequence of vertices @xmath52 there might be no orbit ) .    </S>",
    "<S> now we compute the contribution @xmath87 of an orbit pair @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude @xmath88 differs from @xmath89 only due to the vertex - scattering matrix elements picked up at the self - intersection point @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 gets a contribution @xmath90 from the two encounters of vertex @xmath62 , while @xmath91 has the combination of adjacent vertices exchanged @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath93 where @xmath94 is equal to the product of matrices @xmath95 over the sequence @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> after inserting this result into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rsum_gen1 ] ) we can sum over the variables @xmath97 and get @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> after a similar summation over @xmath99 we obtain @xmath100 performing an unrestricted summation over @xmath97 we lost track of the condition @xmath86 , therefore the contribution from such self - retracing orbits is removed by subtracting @xmath101 which will be calculated below .    </S>",
    "<S> note that for large @xmath35 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rsum_gen2 ] ) either @xmath67 or @xmath68 will be large for any @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we partition the sum over @xmath71 into two intervals , @xmath102}+ \\sum_{t'=[t/2]+1}^{t-2}$ ] , where @xmath103 $ ] stands for the integer part . </S>",
    "<S> we use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mix ] ) to argue that in the first interval @xmath104 , while in the second interval @xmath105 . calling @xmath106 the contribution of the interval with small ( large ) @xmath71 </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath107 . substituting @xmath108 into @xmath109 </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the sum over @xmath6 and use the unitary of @xmath110 to show that @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> there are corrections to this result due to the deviation from equidistribution of @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> however so long as the stronger mixing condition given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mixing_condition_strong ] ) holds these corrections can be shown to vanish as @xmath38 . to show this we use the unitarity of @xmath95 and the fact that all matrix elements of @xmath113 are bounded from above by unity .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath114 we set @xmath115 , then the sum over @xmath8 can be written as @xmath116 , since the matrix @xmath110 is both unitary and symmetric . </S>",

    "<S> the sum over all these configurations to the right of @xmath124 yields @xmath125 or @xmath126 for even or odd @xmath71 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the transitions from @xmath124 to the left can also be expressed in classical terms , resulting in @xmath127 matrix elements of large powers of @xmath30 can again be approximated by @xmath128 both above and in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : res_uncorrected ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we see that the first two terms in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> this , we believe , can be shown by considering more and more complicated pairs of orbits , eventually deriving a complete expansion of the form factor in powers of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we briefly discuss two specific models , to which eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : result ] ) applies . </S>",
    "<S> we consider complete graphs with @xmath10 vertices and @xmath131 directed bonds connecting every pair of vertices including a bond from a vertex to itself . </S>",
    "<S> the first model we consider has `` discrete fourier transform '' ( dft ) boundary conditions at each vertex @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second has neumann boundary conditions @xcite @xmath132 the dft graph is a uniformly hyperbolic model : the weights of all classical orbits with the same length are equal . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath133 for @xmath134 , i.  e.  all correlations vanish immediately and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mix ] ) is an identity . for the neumann graph , which is not uniformly hyperbolic , </S>",
    "<S> the situation is more complicated : here we have @xmath135 and @xmath136 with @xmath137 , but substituting @xmath138 and using @xmath139 as @xmath38 it is easy to see that @xmath140 converges for large graphs exponentially fast to equidistribution .    </S>",
