    "the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory correspondence ( ads / cft ) or gauge / gravity duality is a new proving ground to describe strongly correlated systems , and its application to unresolved questions in condensed matter is an exciting new direction .",
    "it is especially compelling , as conventional methods , such as large-@xmath0 ref.@xcite and @xmath1-type ref.@xcite expansions fail to describe quantum critical behavior in @xmath2-dimensional systems .",
    "the primary examples of such are the strange metal states in the high @xmath3 cuprates and heavy fermion systems .",
    "both systems are characterized by anomalous behavior of transport and thermodynamic quantities . in heavy fermions",
    ", the sommerfeld coefficient grows as the temperature is lowered , meaning that the effective mass of the electrons on the fermi surface diverges or the fermi energy of the electrons vanishes ref.@xcite . in the strange metal phase of the high @xmath3 superconductors as well as in heavy fermions near a quantum phase transition , the resistivity is linear with temperature @xmath4 .",
    "these anomalous behaviors are partly explained by the phenomenological marginal fermi liquid model ref.@xcite , and it is an early success of ads / cft that the marginal fermi liquid can be seen to emerge as the low - energy dynamics of a consistent theory .",
    "a particularly simple gravity description for strongly interacting finite density matter is the planar ads - reissner - nordstrm ( ads - rn ) black hole ( bh ) , which is dual to a system at finite chemical potential .",
    "while the ads - rn black hole is a natural starting point to study the universal aspects of finite charge density systems , the universality of a black hole makes it difficult to explain experiments that are keen on the nature of the charge carriers , such as transport properties ( e.  g. conductivity ) .",
    "in particular the dominance of pauli blocking for observed physics , requires that at the minimum one needs to add free dirac fermions to the ads - rn background .",
    "a self - consistent treatment shows that this system is unstable to a quasi - lifshitz geometry in the bulk refs.@xcite , that encodes for a deconfined fermi liquid system refs.@xcite .",
    "here we shall initiate the study of instabilities in the unstable metallic ads - rn phase that are driven by fermi bilinears .",
    "the essential low - energy property of the metallic system dual to the ads - rn black hole background is the emergence of fermi surfaces refs.@xcite where the notion of a quasiparticle needs not be well defined , i.e. stable ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we used the magnetic field as an external probe to change the characteristics of the fermi surface excitations and as a consequence the transport properties of the system .",
    "it strongly suggested that a quantum phase transition should occur when the underlying quasiparticle becomes ( un)stable as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "the study in this article of the influence on stability of fermi bilinears allows us to show that there is a phase transition between the two regimes and that for a specific set of parameters the critical temperature vanishes .",
    "our work is therefore also a fermionic companion to ref.@xcite .    continuing the connection of ads models to actual observations ,",
    "the results we find resemble other experimental findings in quantum - critical systems . at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields , the resistance of single - layer graphene at the dirac point undergoes a thousandfold increase within a narrow interval of field strengths ref.@xcite .",
    "the abruptness of the increase suggests that a transition to a field - induced insulating , ordered state occurs at the critical field @xmath5 ref.@xcite . in bilayer graphene ,",
    "measurements taken at the filling factor @xmath6 point show that , similar to single layer graphene , the bilayer becomes insulating at strong magnetic field ref.@xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the divergent resistivity in strong magnetic fields was analyzed in terms of kosterlitz - thouless localization ref.@xcite and the gap opening in the zeroth landau level ref.@xcite .",
    "however , it remains a theoretical challenge to explain a highly unusual approach to the insulating state . despite the steep divergence of resistivity , the profile of @xmath7 vs. @xmath8 at",
    "fixed @xmath9 saturates to a @xmath8-independent value at low temperatures , which is consistent with gapless charge - carrying excitations ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite in the magnetic field , the temperature of the metal - insulator phase transition @xmath10 increases with increasing field strength , contrary to the @xmath10 dependence in the classical low field limit ref.@xcite .",
    "the anomalous @xmath10 behavior has been successfully modeled within a dynamical gap picture ref.@xcite .",
    "the available data suggest that by tuning the magnetic field graphene approaches a quantum critical point , beyond which a new insulating phase develops with anomalous behavior @xmath10 .",
    "this picture is in agreement with expectations of quantum critical behavior , where e.  g. in heavy fermion metal a new magnetically ordered state ( antiferromagnet ) emerges when tuned through the quantum critical point ref.@xcite .",
    "we shall see that the same qualitative physics emerges with our use of the the magnetic field as a knob to tune to the ir fixed point to gain some insight into the quantum critical behavior driven by fermion bilinears . in our gauge / gravity dual prescription , the unusual properties characteristic for quantum criticality",
    "can be understood as being controlled by the scaling dimension of the fermion operator in the emergent ir fixed point .",
    "the novel insight of ads / cft is that the low - energy behavior of a strongly coupled quantum critical system is governed by a nontrivial unstable fixed point which exhibits nonanalytic scaling behavior in the temporal direction only ( the retarded green s function of the ir cft is @xmath11 ) ref.@xcite .",
    "this fixed point manifests itself as a near - horizon region of the black hole with ads@xmath12 geometry which is ( presumably ) dual to a one - dimensional ir cft .",
    "building on the semilocal description of the quasiparticle characteristics by simple dyson summation in a fermi gas coupled to this 1 + 1-dimensional ir cft ref.@xcite an appealing picture arises that quantum critical fermionic fluctuations in the ir cft generate relevant order parameter perturbations of the fermi liquid theory . whether this is truly what is driving the physics is an open question .",
    "regardless , quantum critical matter is universal in the sense that no information about the microscopic nature of the material enters .",
    "qualitatively our study should apply to any bilinear instability in the strange metal phase of unconventional superconductors , heavy fermions as well as for a critical point in graphene .",
    "universality makes applications of ads / cft to quantum critical phenomena justifiable and appealing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the ads - rn black hole solution in ads - einstein - maxwell gravity coupled to charged fermions and the dual interpretation as a quantum critical fermion system at finite density . in sec .",
    "iii we use the bilinear formalism put forward in ref.@xcite to explore an instability of a quantum system towards a quantum phase transition using the ads dual description .",
    "we study a quantum phase transition to an insulating phase as a function of the magnetic field . for completeness",
    "we test the various phases by a spectral analysis in sec .",
    "we conclude by discussing a phase space in @xmath13 variables for a quantum critical matter at nonzero temperatures .",
    "the gravity dual to a @xmath2-dimensional cft at finite density in the presence of a magnetic field starts with the einstein - maxwell action describing an asymptotically ads@xmath14 geometry @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the gauge field , @xmath17 is an effective dimensionless gauge coupling and the curvature radius of ads@xmath14 is set to unity .",
    "the equations of motion following from eq.([action - g ] ) are solved by a dyonic ads black hole , having both electric and magnetic charge @xmath18 where the redshift factor @xmath19 and the vector field @xmath16 are given by @xmath20 the ads boundary is reached for @xmath21 , the black hole horizon is at @xmath22 and the electric and magnetic charge of the black hole @xmath23 and @xmath24 , encoding the chemical potential @xmath25 and magnetic field @xmath9 of the dual cft , are scaled such that the black hole temperature equals and @xmath26 . ]",

    "the gauge choice for the a magnetic field obviously breaks the isotropy , but the physical isotropy still ensures that the spectral functions simplify in this basis ref.@xcite . the @xmath50-dependent part of the dirac equation can be solved analytically in terms of gaussian - damped hermite polynomials @xmath65 with eigenvalues @xmath66 quantized in terms of the landau index @xmath67 refs.@xcite .",
    "the dirac equation @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a diagonal matrix in terms of @xmath70 and whose square is proportional to the identity , then reduces to @xmath71 we introduce now the projectors @xmath72 that split the four - component bispinors into two two - component spinors @xmath73 where the index @xmath74 is the dirac index of the boundary theory @xmath75 the projectors commute with both @xmath55 and @xmath23 ( recall that @xmath76 ) . at zero magnetic field projectors are given by @xmath77 with unit vector @xmath78 .",

    "it is identical to the ads - dirac equation for an ads - rn black hole with zero magnetic charge when the discrete eigenvalue @xmath69 is identified with the ( size of the ) momentum @xmath83 .    as we have shown in ref.@xcite , solving eq.([dirac ] ) is equivalent to solving the dirac equation at zero magnetic field but with a rescaled chemical potential and fermion charge . at @xmath28",
    "the mapping is given by ref.@xcite @xmath84 which we will use further .",
    "the objective of this paper is to use the magnetic field as a tool to probe our unstable quantum critical system dual to the dyonic ads - rn geometry .",
    "we show that the instability is manifest in the appearance of ordering in the system : the magnetic field acts as a catalyzer for the particle - hole pairing . in particular",
    ", we will find an unusual behavior for the critical temperature of the normal to paired phase transition as the dialing of the magnetic field drives the system to a quantum crtitical point : for a critical magnetic field the critical temperature vanishes indicating a new emergent quantum critical point .",
    "we will identify the bulk quantities in the bilinear approach which are dual to the sought - for quantities on the cft side .",
    "we have given the setup of the bilinear formalism in ref.@xcite .",
    "here , we will first give a concise review with the focus on the transport properties and the influence of magnetic fields , and then derive the bilinear equations relevant for computing the pairing gap .      a controlled method for calculating the expectation value of some composite",
    "operator @xmath85 with the structure of a fermion bilinear ( @xmath86 ) has been put forward in ref.@xcite and it is based on a relation between the bulk and the boundary propagator in the isotropic single - particle approximation .",
    "this allows us to identify the familiar quantities at the boundary by matching the resulting expression to known thermodynamic relations .",
    "the crucial object was identified in ref.@xcite @xmath87 and it is the spatial average of the @xmath88 current four - vector in the bulk . ] .",
    "the metric then assumes the form given in the first section by eq.([geometry ] ) ( so that the horizon is located at @xmath89 and the boundary is at @xmath90 ) .",
    "having defined the radial projection of the bulk dirac equation in eq.([projection ] ) we can also define the radial projections of the current as @xmath91 where @xmath74 and @xmath92 is a pauli matrix acting in the boundary frame .",
    "the boundary interpretation of this current is , however , subtler than the simple @xmath88 conserved current which it is in the bulk ref.@xcite : it expresses the migdal theorem , i.e. the density of quasiparticles in the vicinity of the fermi surface . to see this ,",
    "express the bulk spinors @xmath93 at an arbitrary value of @xmath49 through the bulk - to - boundary propagators @xmath94 and the boundary spinors @xmath95 as @xmath96 the meaning of the above expressions is clear : the spinors evolve from their horizon values toward the values in the bulk at some @xmath49 , under the action of the bulk - to - boundary propagator @xmath94 acting upon them ( normalized by its value at the boundary ) . to find the relation with the boundary green s function we need to know",

    "the bulk - to - boundary green s function ( in dimensionless units ) can be constructed from the solutions to the dirac equation ref.@xcite as in eq.([bulk - boundary ] ) . using eq.([bndpsir ] ) and the expression for the wronskian , we arrive at the following relation between the boundary asymptotics of the solutions @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath101 taking into account the dictionary entry for the boundary propagator from eq.([gfinish ] ) and the representation eq.([bulk - psi ] ) for @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the retarded propagator at the boundary is @xmath102 with @xmath89 . using eq.([gret ] ) and the definition for the current in eq.([psipm ] ) it can now be shown that the current @xmath103 _ for an on - shell solution _ becomes at the boundary ref.@xcite @xmath104 it is well known ref.@xcite that the integral of the propagator is related to the charge density . in particular , for @xmath105 and for the horizon boundary conditions chosen so that @xmath106 ( feynman propagator ) , we obtain @xmath107 i.e. the bilinear @xmath108 directly expresses the charge density @xmath109 , i.e. look at the location of the fermi surface . by analogy , we can now see that the components @xmath110 correspond to current densities .",
    "in particular , the ratio of the spatial components @xmath111 in the external electric field @xmath112 readily gives the expression for the conductivity tensor @xmath113 .",
    "finally , the formalism outlined above allows us to define an arbitrary bilinear @xmath114 and to compute its expectation value . by choosing the matrix @xmath115",
    "appropriately we are able to model particle - hole , particle - particle or any other current .",
    "notice however that all bilinears @xmath116 are proportional on shell , as can be seen from eqs.([gret]-[gretj ] ) , which hold also for any other matrix @xmath115 sandwiched between the two bulk propagators .",
    "the proportionality is at fixed parameters ( @xmath25 , @xmath8 , etc ) so the dependences of the form @xmath117 and @xmath118 will be different for different choices of @xmath115 .",
    "to introduce another crucial current , we will study the form of the action .",
    "( we will define our action to model the quantum phase transition and to define the pairing excitonic gap in section [ pairing ] . )",

    "the bulk fermionic term does not contribute , being proportional to the equation of motion , while the boundary terms include the holographic factors of the form @xmath135 .",
    "in accordance with our earlier conclusion that the on - shell bilinears are all proportional , we can reexpress the free energy in eq.([free - act ] ) as @xmath136 where the chemical potential reappears in the prefactor and the fermionic term becomes of the form @xmath137 , confirming again that @xmath138 can be associated with the number density .      now we will put to work our bilinear approach in order to explicitly compute the particle - hole ( excitonic ) pairing operator .",
    "we add a scalar field which interacts with fermions by the yukawa coupling as done in ref.@xcite .",

    "the scalar field is neutral @xmath151 .",
    "the yukawa coupling @xmath152 is allowed to be positive and negative .",
    "when the coupling is positive @xmath153 , a repulsive interaction makes it harder to form the particle - hole condesate .",
    "therefore it lowers the critical temperature and can be used as a knob to tune to a vanishing critical temperature @xmath154 at a critical value @xmath155 which defines a quantum critical point .",
    "when the coupling is negative @xmath156 , an attractive interaction facilitates pairing and helps to form the condensate .",
    "both situations can be described when the interaction term is viewed as a dynamical mass of either sign due to the fact that it is in @xmath157 channel .",
    "for @xmath153 , interaction @xmath158 introduces a new massive pole : massless free fermion field aquires a mass which makes it harder to condense . for @xmath156",
    ", there is a tachyonic instability .",
    "the exponentially growing tachyonic mode is resolved by a condensate formation , a new stable ground state .",
    "it can be shown that we do not need a nonzero chemical potential to form a condensate in this case .",
    "a similar situation was considered in ref.@xcite for the superconducting instability where the spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath88 was achieved by the boundary double - trace deformation . in our case for the electron - hole pairing",
    ", @xmath159 symmetry is spontaneously broken by a neutral order parameter .",
    "next we discuss the choice for the gamma - matrix structure @xmath160 of the yukawa interaction eq.([yukawa_action ] ) and the corresponding pairing parameter @xmath161 @xmath162 now we explain our choice of the pairing operator and give a rigorous justification for this choice .    in principle , any operator that creates a particle and a hole with the same quantum numbers could be taken to define @xmath161 .",
    "this translates into the requirements @xmath163=0,\\lbrace\\gamma,\\gamma^0\\rbrace=0,\\left[\\gamma,\\hat{c}\\right]=0.\\ ] ] ( anti ) commutation with ( time ) space gamma matrices is required for the preservation of homogeneity and isotropy , and the last one is there to preserve the particle - hole symmetry .",

    "this gives three candidate bilinears    * for @xmath175 we get the bulk current @xmath176 , i.e. the mass operator in the bulk .",

    "the equation of motion for @xmath177 eq.([i0def ] ) exclusively depends on the @xmath88 current and thus can not encapsulate the density of the neutral particle - hole pairs : indeed , we directly see that the right - hand side equals zero if the total charge current vanishes . * for @xmath178 ,",
    "the bulk current is @xmath179 .",
    "the crucial difference with respect to the first case is the relative minus sign .",
    "it is due to this sign that the current _ couples to itself _",
    ", i.e. it is a response to a nonzero parameter @xmath152 , as we will see soon . * for @xmath180 ,",
    "the resulting bulk current is @xmath181 .",
    "it sources the radial gauge field @xmath182 which is believed to be equal to zero in all meaningful holographic setups , as the radial direction corresponds to the renormalization group ( rg ) scale .",
    "thus , this operator is again not the response to the attractive pairing interaction .",
    "we are therefore left with one possibility only : @xmath183 which is also consistent with the choice of our gauge at nonzero magnetic field .",
    "we will therefore work with the channel @xmath184 as we have discussed earlier , the isotropy in the @xmath185 plane remains unbroken by the radial magnetic field , and hence the expectation value should in fact be ascribed to the current @xmath186 with @xmath187 .",
    "we show the equivalence of the @xmath188 and @xmath189 order parameters below .",
    "the choice of the @xmath48 channel is motivated by technical simplicity due to the form of the projection operator and the fermion basis we use , eq.([projection ] ) : @xmath190 with @xmath74 , since @xmath191 with @xmath192 .",
    "finally , we note that the structure of the currents defined in eqs.([jeq],[psipm ] ) depends on the basis choice and that the currents as such have no physical interpretation in the boundary theory : physical meaning can only be ascribed to the expectation values ref.@xcite .",
    "it is exactly the expectation values that encode for the condensation ( order ) on the field theory side refs.@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence does not provide a straightforward way to match a double - trace condensate to a boundary operator , though only single - trace fields are easy to identify with the operators at the boundary .",
    "indeed , in holographic superconductors a superconducting condensate is modeled by a charged scalar field @xmath193 ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) . as in ref.@xcite , we argue by matching discrete symmetries on the gravity and field theory sides , that the expectation of the bulk current @xmath194 is gravity dual of the pairing particle - hole gap .",
    "let us consider properties of the corresponding condensates with respect to discrete symmetries , parity and charge conjugation , in the ads four - dimensional space . according to eq.([ptrans ] ) ,",
    "@xmath195 and @xmath196 are scalars and parity even , while @xmath194 is a pseudoscalar and parity odd . as for the charge conjugation",
    ", we easily find that @xmath195 and @xmath194 commute with @xmath197 , while @xmath196 anticommutes .",
    "since the latter is the component of a vector current while the former two are ( pseudo)scalars , we find that all operators preserve the particle number , as promised . the magnetic field @xmath24 is odd under both parity and charge conjugation , and therefore it is unaffected by @xmath198 .",

    "we summarize the transformation properties of the four- and three - dimensional condensates together with the magnetic field @xmath201 which shows that the symmetry properties are matched between @xmath202 and @xmath203 condensates : they spontaneously break the cp symmetry while the magnetic field leaves it intact",
    ". therefore our ads / cft dictionary between the bulk and boundary quantities is @xmath204 and @xmath205 , with the corresponding conformal dimensions of boundary operators given by eq.([irnu - psi ] ) and eq.([irnu - i ] ) .",
    "the natural bulk extension is now the current @xmath206 and it is understood that in nonzero magnetic field the integration over @xmath83 degenerates into the sum over landau levels ( this holds for all currents in this section ) .",
    "we will soon show that a complete set of bulk equations of motion for the operator eq.([jdelta ] ) requires a set of currents that we label @xmath207 , @xmath134 and @xmath208 . in the representation eq.([matrices ] ) we introduce the following bilinears of the fermion field @xmath209 where the pairing parameter @xmath210 in eq.([jdelta ] ) is @xmath211 , the index @xmath212 for the zeroth component is omitted in @xmath207 , and @xmath213 .",

    "we need to know the evolution equations for the currents and the scalar field and to complement them with the maxwell equations .",
    "we will show that the equations of motion for all currents generically have nonzero solutions .",
    "this suggests that , due to the coupling with the uv cft , the pairing can occur spontaneously , without explicitly adding new terms to the action ( there is no need to add an interaction for fermions in the bulk ) .",
    "nevertheless , we will also analyze the situation with nonzero @xmath152 and show what new phenomena it brings as compared to uv cft - only coupling ( i.e. no bulk coupling ) .",
    "let us start from the equations of motion .",
    "the dirac and klein - gordon equations are to be complemented with the maxwell equation @xmath214 which is reduced when the scalar is real , @xmath150 , to @xmath215 in the background of a dyonic black hole with the metric @xmath216 the maxwell equation for the component @xmath146 is @xmath217 where we have used @xmath218 .    in our setup",
    "we ignore the backreaction to @xmath219 , treating it as a fixed external field .",

    "the scaling behavior of the condensate is , however , different in our setup : as pointed out before , due to the lowest landau level ( lll ) , the dimensional reduction @xmath592 takes place in the bulk .",
    "this reduces the equation of motion to an effective schrdinger equation for the condensate , given by eq.([jscheq ] ) with the potential eq.([wkbpot ] ) . solving the equation ,",
    "we have found the ir behavior of the condensate near the horizon of the rn black hole ( @xmath593 ) to be less divergent than the one near the monopole @xmath502 or the monopole wall @xmath594 ref.@xcite .",
    "it turns out that the ads space with two boundaries : the uv boundary and the ir hard wall , plays an additional role in stabilizing the chiral condensate refs.@xcite .",
    "it also provides an important hint for the interpretation of our current @xmath595 in the boundary theory .",
    "in particular , for the lightest states to condense , we should take the lll which only has one spin state available ( instead of two states available for the higher lls ) .",
    "this means that for a given charge , the spin direction is fixed .",
    "therefore , fixing the direction of motion and the charge fixes also the helicity .",
    "out of eight possibilities with a given charge , helicity and direction , only four are available for the lll , as depicted at fig.([plot - particle - hole ] ) ( left ) .",
    "the charge @xmath596 denotes @xmath597 , positive / negative helicity is denoted by r / l , and @xmath598 gives the spin orientation , lines with arrows show the momentum direction and @xmath9 stands for the magnetic field .",

    "it can not be our order parameter either , since our current is a spin singlet .",
    "it is tempting to regard the doublet @xmath608 , @xmath609 as a vector , and we leave it for a future work .",
    "we are thus left with the second combination .",
    "one can think of this order parameter as a spin - density wave , or magnetization which precesses around the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the analog of the second combination has been considered within the sakai - sugimoto model as a holographic top - down approach to qcd ref.@xcite .",
    "the setting of ref.@xcite is very different from ours : it identifies the embedding coordinate of a probe d - brane with a scalar field dual to a single - trace fermion bilinear operator ; the magnetic catalysis is modeled as bending of the probe brane under the influence of the magnetic field .",
    "there the anisotropic spatially modulated csb condensate in the form of a single plane wave of larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell ( loff ) state has been found . to have a condensate in the form of the second combination , we need to introduce the @xmath610 spin symmetry as in ref.@xcite .",
    "we should note the difference with our case where the construction of the condensate is done in the bulk and there is a special effort involved to identify the boundary operator .",
    "provided the condensate of the second form is realized , the ads boundary and the ir hard wall play a stabilizing role in its formation ref.@xcite .",
    "as the pair @xmath602 `` bounces '' from either of the boundaries it converts into the pair @xmath603 conserving the total charge .",
    "this process can be decomposed into elementary `` bouncing '' events    * @xmath611 , @xmath612 - helicity is conserved , spin flips , mixing of charge occurs * @xmath613 , @xmath614 - helicity flips , spin and charge are unaffected    in the first case a particle deposits the charge at the boundary , which is picked up by the antiparticle , thus conserving the total charge of the particle - hole pair .",
    "the main difference between the two cases is either the `` bouncing '' event involves spin flip or not , therefore either helicity is conserved or broken , respectively . by imposing the ads boundary condition which breaks cs",
    ", helicity gets inverted by the boundary and cs breaking propagates from the boundary into the bulk .",
    "then cs breaking occurs due to the boundary condition before the chiral condensate forms , which affects the propagation of the fields in the bulk in accordance with the second case stabilizing the condensate ref.@xcite .",
    "next we discuss an analogy between the mc and the bcs cooper pairing , and mapping between the gross - neveu model ( or the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) ) in the presence of the magnetic field and the bcs model at nonzero chemical potential .",
    "the reason this mapping works is that effectively the dynamics in both cases is one dimensional : in the strong magnetic field the motion is constrained to larmor orbits and includes only states from the lowest landau level , while in a high density system only states at the fermi surface contribute to the dynamics .",
    "we can draw the following analogy ref.@xcite @xmath615 where the acronym dos stands for the density of states .",

    ", the density of states at the @xmath620 surface separating electrons and holes contributes to the gap , and a similar cost in energy @xmath621 exists to involve both particles and holes to pair . the gain from the pairing is proportional to @xmath622 in both cases , and is linear in @xmath623 for the bcs and in @xmath9 for the mc , manifesting the essence of both phenomena .",
    "these simple formulas for @xmath616 can be obtained when there is a hierarchy of scales : the largest scale is @xmath25 in the bcs and it is @xmath9 in the mc .    the comparison given in eq.([mapping_models ] ) provides the following mapping between parameters in the two systems at a nonzero density and at a nonzero magnetic field ref.@xcite @xmath624 where the last line expresses the hierarchy of scales . a similar",

    "if we take @xmath726 to be the pole of the full propagator , @xmath726 becomes imaginary and a generalization of hyperbolic functions to the @xmath160 functions is necessary as in eq.([generalization ] ) .",

    "we calculate the dc conductivity in the boundary theory using the gravity-``dressed '' retarded / advanced fermion propagators . strictly speaking , we need",
    "also the `` dressed '' vertex , to satisfy the ward identities .",
    "as argued in ref.@xcite however , the boundary vertex which is obtained from the bulk one can be approximated by a constant in the low temperature limit .",
    "also , according to ref.@xcite , the vertex only carries the singularities of the product of the green s functions .",
    "therefore , dressing the vertex will not change the temperature dependence of the dc conductivity at low @xmath690 ref.@xcite .",
    "we can start from the kubo formula for conductivity @xmath775 the polarization operator @xmath776 is given by @xmath777 where the fermion frequency is @xmath778 , and the boson frequency is @xmath779 , and in the low temperature limit @xmath780 . usually the most difficult step is to take the matsubara sum .",
    "here we can do it in two ways .",
    "the first way consists of analytically continuing in the complex plane @xmath716 and replacing the matsubara sum by a contour integral with the fermi distribution function @xmath781 whose poles sit at the matsubara frequencies along the imaginary axis .",
    "the second way is to use the spectral representation . in both cases we follow ref.@xcite , where transport coefficients were calculated with propagators including their imaginary parts .",
    "taking the first way , we have for the fermion matsubara sum @xmath782 where the contour along the imaginary @xmath49 axis can be deformed to the contour c which goes along two branch cuts , @xmath783 and @xmath784 , and the large arcs @xmath160 with vanishing contribution ref.@xcite .",
    "the fermion propagator has a branch cut along @xmath785 refs.@xcite .",
    "therefore we can rewrite @xmath786 where the difference of the retarded and advanced functions in the first bracket is due to the discontinuity along @xmath785 and in the second bracket it is due to the discontinuity along @xmath787 .",
    "this contribution corresponds to the second term in eq.([contour - integral ] ) , and there are no pole contributions ref.@xcite .",
    "we use the usual prescription for retarded and advanced green s functions , @xmath788 and @xmath789 and suppress the momentum indices . taking @xmath790 , we have @xmath791 where we changed the integration variable in the second integral @xmath792 . in the limit @xmath793 , the dominant contribution comes from the pair @xmath794 , and it is inversely proportional to the distance between the poles given by the imaginary part @xmath764 . the combinations @xmath795 and @xmath796 with the poles on one side of the real axis make a much smaller contribution due to the cancellation between the residues at the poles . therefore , as @xmath687 , we have @xmath797 and @xmath798 in the small-@xmath8 limit the vertex is a constant .",
    "we integrate around the fermi surface , and therefore the momentum integral is @xmath799 with @xmath738 .",
    "we exchange the order of integration and perform first the momentum integration refs.@xcite . for @xmath687",
    ", we have @xmath800 writing @xmath801 , we have for @xmath687 @xmath802 where we have dropped constant terms .",
    "note that we get the same result for the conductivity also if we use @xmath803 in the contour integral eq.([contour - integral ] ) since @xmath804 . for the landau fermi liquid @xmath805 at small @xmath8 refs.@xcite .",
    "we get @xmath806 meaning that we recover the standard result for the resistivity of the fermi liquid : @xmath807 .",
    "in our case , @xmath808 , which produces @xmath809 this result agrees with the dc conductivity obtained in ref.@xcite . for the marginal",
    "liquid , @xmath810 , we recover the resistivity @xmath4 , which is empirically found in the strange metal phase .    *",
    "it is interesting that the scaling behavior of the dc conductivity is the same as the single particle scattering rate . on the gravity side",
    "it is explained by the fact that the dissipative part of the current - current correlator is controlled by the rate of the bulk fermion falling in the horizon , given by the single - particle scattering rate . comparing the resistivity in the quantum critical metal @xmath754 to the one in the normal metal @xmath753 , @xmath811 which indicates that the quantum critical metal becomes increasingly insulating as @xmath360",
    "is decreased .",
    "this suggests that there is some sort of ordering in the system , not necessarily associated with a gap .",
    "to check our calculation , we get the dc conductivity using the spectral representation @xmath812 where the spectral function @xmath813 is given by eq.([spectral ] ) . for the product of the green functions we use the following formula",
    "@xmath814 taking @xmath815 , the polarization operator is given by @xmath816 performing the integration over @xmath817 , we have @xmath818 in the limit @xmath687 , the momentum integration proceeds as @xmath819 with @xmath820 . therefore , the dc conductivity given by eq.([conductivity ] ) is @xmath821 which is the same as eq.([resultcond ] ) obtained by the contour integration .",
