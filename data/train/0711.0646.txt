    "any dissipative impedance connected to the josephson junction produces johnson - nyquist current noise , which can yield thermal escape and switching .",

    "[ ivjj ]    the current - voltage characteristics of the josephson junction , shown in fig.[ivjj ] for two values of the current through the nis  junction , is obtained by sweeping back and forth the voltage @xmath53 and recording both the current ( from the voltage across a @xmath54 resistor placed at the base temperature ) and the voltage",

    "compared to a perfect current bias , our bias scheme limits the production of quasiparticles at the josephson junction . however , we observed in the @xmath49 characteristics of the josephson junction a large sub - gap current peak close to @xmath58 , leading to increased heating for the largest switching current .",
    "we therefore had to reduce the duty cycle of the applied pulses to a value such that heating could be neglected . in order to extract the parameters determining the dynamics of the josephson junction , we first used resonant activation resonant , thesebh to extract the plasma frequency @xmath59 at @xmath60 , and determine its quality factor @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , from the value of the plasma frequency , one can estimate the cross - over temperature between the regimes of thermal activation and quantum tunneling : @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , and as stated above , switching does occur due to thermal activation for all experimentally accessible temperatures . then , from the measurement of the number of switching events for a large number of current pulses , we deduced the dependence of the switching rate on the current through the josephson junction .",
    "equation ( [ rate ] ) then yields the critical current @xmath63 and the escape temperature @xmath64 .",
    "the fact that the latter temperature is slightly larger than the fridge temperature comes mainly from the heating of the resistor @xmath65 by the current pulses thesebh .",

    "in this section we present a theoretical analysis of the switching of a josephson junction out of its zero voltage state driven by thermal as well as weak non - gaussian noise . according to the experimental situation described above ( fig .",
    "[ schemeeps.eps ] ) , the underlying stochastic processes are assumed to be classical , both for the dynamics of the detector , the josephson junction , and for the electrical noise originating from the mesoscopic conductor , the tunnel junction . hence , the standard rsj model applies , where now the total noise consists of the johnson - nyquist noise @xmath116 , in the simplest case produced by a resistor @xmath28 in parallel to the josephson junction , and of the mesoscopic noise @xmath7 from the fluctuating part of the mesoscopic current @xmath117 .",
    "since the dc - component @xmath118 of the mesoscopic current can be incorporated trivially , we only focus in the sequel on its fluctuating part @xmath7 .",
    "then , according to the kirchhoff rules we have for the currents entering the detector @xmath119where @xmath17 denotes its phase difference and the other quantities are defined according to fig .",
    "[ schemeeps.eps ] . to proceed",
    "it is convenient to work with dimensionless quantities and to scale times with @xmath120 , energies with @xmath121 , and currents with @xmath4 .",
    "this way , we arrive with @xmath122 and @xmath123 at a classical langevin equation for the phase dynamics , i.e. , @xmath124with the quality factor @xmath125 of the unbiased junction , the scaled bias current @xmath126 , and the scaled noise sources @xmath127 and @xmath128 for thermal and non - gaussian noise , respectively .",
    "these two noisy forces are assumed to be markovian , which is an accurate approximation since the experiment is operated in a regime where the typical correlation times are much smaller than the typical time scales of the junction , e.g.  the inverse of the plasma frequency .",
    "this situation also ensures that we can work with continuous noise processes .",
    "hence , we have for the thermal noise @xmath129 and @xmath130where we introduced the dimensional temperature @xmath131 . the non - gaussian noise produced by the tunnel junction is taken as poissonian with @xmath132 , where specifically the second moment reads in",
    "the high voltage / low temperature limit @xmath133 @xmath134with @xmath135 , @xmath136 and the third moment is given by @xmath137the prefactors @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the fano factors for the second and third cumulant . here , for the tunnel junction , @xmath140 .",
    "it is important to realize that the average mesoscopic current @xmath141 can be large so that the second moment ( [ mesosecond ] ) can be comparable to or larger than that of the thermal noise ( [ thermsecond ] ) , while the third moment is still small due to @xmath142 .",
    "in fact , as discussed above , the gaussian component of the mesoscopic noise effectively adds to the thermal noise to determine the effective temperature of the junction @xmath143    so far we have assumed that the resistance seen by the josephson junction is exclusively given by the resistance @xmath28 in parallel to it so that ( [ efftemp ] ) agrees with ( [ teff de noise ] ) only in the limit @xmath144 . in a description closer to the experimental situation",
    "the total resistance is @xmath145 and we have to replace @xmath146 , thus arriving precisely at ( [ teff de noise ] ) .",
    "another simplification is that in the langevin equation ( [ eq : reduced ] ) no back - action effect from the detector to the tunnel junction has been taken into account .",
    "the back - action appears because when the josephson junction switches , the voltage across the tunnel junction no longer coincides with the external voltage , but is reduced by @xmath147 . accordingly , on the one hand in the friction term in ( [ eq : reduced ] ) @xmath148 has to be replaced by @xmath149 and on the other hand the third moment ( [ thirdmoment ] ) carries for finite @xmath150 an additional contribution from the derivative of the second moment ( mesosecond ) with respect to the voltage . for a detailed quantitative comparison with the experiment",
    "these modifications must be taken into account .",
    "based on ( [ eq : reduced ] ) we first give a brief account of a theoretical approach developed recently by one of us @xcite , where an analytical expression for the rate and its asymmetry due to a weak third cumulant of a current through a mesoscopic conductor has been derived . in a second part ,",
    "direct numerical simulations are presented , which allow for a detailed comparison with the analytical predictions and may thus lay out a firm basis for the comparison between theory and experiment .      as usual in rate theory , for analytical treatments it is much more convenient to work with phase space probabilities rather than individual stochastic trajectories .",
    "the general problem for non - gaussian noise is then that the corresponding fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) based on a kramers - moyal expansion contains diffusion coefficients up to infinite order .",
    "the basic idea for weak non - gaussian noise with a leading third cumulant is thus to derive an effective , finite order fokker - planck equation .",
    "based on a cumulant expansion of the noise generating functional such a generalized fpe has been derived in @xcite and leads to a fpe with a momentum dependent diffusion term , where the momentum dependence is weighted by the third cumulant .    the existence of a time - independent switching rate is associated with a quasi - stationary nonequilibrium distribution , which reduces to a thermal equilibrium in the well region and deviates from it only around the barrier top in the case where friction is moderate to high .",
    "this in turn means that the barrier height compared to the thermal energy must be sufficiently large @xmath151 so that switching becomes a rare event on the time scale of the plasma frequency .",
    "the typical thermal rate expression then looks as in ( [ rate ] ) and is dominated by the exponential ( activation factor ) being identical to the probability to reach the barrier top from the well bottom by a thermal fluctuation .",
    "accordingly , the quasi - stationary state ( the flux state ) is written as a product consisting of the thermal distribution and a form factor describing the deviation from it around the barrier top .",
    "the latter one leads to the rate prefactor , while the former one specifies the activation factor . here",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the exponential factor , which provides by far the dominant contribution in the present experimental set - up . within this theoretical framework in @xcite an analytical expression for the exponent including leading corrections due to a third cumulant",
    "have been obtained .",
    "the rate takes the form @xmath152 $ ] with the dimensionless barrier height @xmath153 and the correction @xmath154 due to the third cumulant such that @xmath155 corresponds to @xmath156 and @xmath157 to @xmath158 .",
    "note that we thus consider the bias current @xmath159 as being always positive , while the situation in which one keeps @xmath156 and inverts the bias current follows straightforwardly .    in the dimensionless quantities introduced above one",

    "friction @xmath163 , the only dependence of @xmath99 on friction is through the effective temperature ( see eq.(efftemp ) ) . when the asymmetry is small enough , it is directly proportional to the fano factor @xmath139 , leading to a clear measure of the third order cumulant of the noise ( fig .",
    "[ fig : numerical]b ) .",
    "let us first look at the dependence of @xmath164 when the mesoscopic current varies ( fig .  [ fig : numerical]a ) . for small @xmath165",
    "the effective temperature coincides with the actual temperature @xmath166 and @xmath164 grows linearly with @xmath165 . for large @xmath165 the heating originates solely from the mesoscopic current , i.e.  @xmath167 , so that @xmath164 decreases roughly @xmath168 and the rate asymmetry vanishes due to a growing second cumulant compared to the third one .",
    "consequently , there is a changeover between these two regimes with a maximum of the rate asymmetry around the range , where @xmath169 [ see ( [ efftemp ] ) ] .    in the experiment ,",
    "the junction is operated essentially at a fixed switching rate , with @xmath170 tuned at each mesoscopic current @xmath171 to a value such that @xmath172 is kept constant .",
    "in this situation it is instructive to look for the scaling properties of the rate asymmetry as a function of the bare exponent @xmath172 . in general , to express @xmath173 in terms of @xmath172 leads to a rather involved expression .",
    "transparent formulae are found if the asymmetry is sufficiently small so that a linearization of the exponential in ( [ rateasymm ] ) applies , for vanishing thermal noise @xmath174 , and in the limits of strong and weak friction , respectively .",
    "then , one writes for ( [ rateasymm ] ) @xmath175 and looks for that exponent @xmath176 for which the prefactor @xmath177 displays the weakest dependence on @xmath172 .",
    "this way , one finds in the regime of weak friction that @xmath178 , while for strong friction one has @xmath179 .    to complete this discussion",
    ", we remark that an analytical expression for the asymmetry of the escape rate in the limits of low and high friction has been also derived in @xcite within the framework of an onsager - machlup type of functional representation of the stochastic process combined with an asymptotic evaluation ( high barrier , weak third cumulant ) of the path integrals .",
    "the expression ( [ rateasymm ] ) reduces for low @xmath180 exactly to the one specified there . for high",
    "@xmath180 both results give also precisely the same dependence on the physical quantities , but with slightly different numerical constants .",
    "further , back - action effects according to the discussion at the end of the previous section can be included in ( rateasymm ) in the same way as in ref .",
    "@xcite since both theoretical approaches start from the same langevin equation .",
    "hence , we conclude that , up to small corrections , both theories make identical predictions , where the advantage of ( [ rateasymm ] ) is that it provides an analytical expression for all damping strengths .",
    "direct numerical simulations of the escape rate of a josephson junction in presence of a weakly non - gaussian noise are based on the langevin equation ( [ eq : reduced ] ) with the mesoscopic noise term @xmath181 being represented as @xmath182 the random variables @xmath183 are the times at which a tunneling event occurs in the mesoscopic tunneling junction .",

    "the reason for that will be discussed below .    the scaling of the rate asymmetry as a function of @xmath172 is shown in fig.fig:numericalc for strong ( @xmath215 ) and in fig.[fig : numerical]d for weaker ( @xmath216 ) friction . in the former case we find an accurate agreement with the analytical expression ( [ rateasymm ] ) even for low barriers . in the latter situation",
    "the analytical expression describes the scaling with respect to @xmath172 correctly , however , for lower barriers the absolute values exceed the numerical ones by about 100% , while for somewhat higher barriers , for which convergent data could be obtained for @xmath217 , the deviations become smaller , namely 50% .",
    "note , that for weaker damping the variance of the numerical data around an average behavior increases and is typically of the order of 10% . for even larger values of @xmath172",
    "the switching becomes an extremely rare event and the statistics deteriorate drastically .",
    "the obvious discrepancy for lower barriers that has already been seen in fig.[fig : numerical]a does not come as a surprise since , as known from standard kramers rate theory , escape rates are calculated as expansions in @xmath218 and the exponential activation factor dominates only for sufficiently large @xmath172 . in particular in the weak friction regime finite barrier corrections as well as the rate _",
    "prefactor _ tend to play an even more important role when one approaches the energy - diffusion limit , where the rate vanishes with decreasing friction strength .",
    "the turnover between energy - diffusion and spatial - diffusion occurs around @xmath219 so that the simulated data displayed in fig.fig:numericald in the range of lower barrier heights are certainly influenced by these effects .",
    "the overall picture emerging is hence that within the statistical uncertainties of the simulations , the analytical theories developed for the switching of the josephson junction predict quantitatively the influence of a weak third cumulant of non - gaussian noise up to minor deviations due to prefactor effects over a broad range of parameters .",
    "as expected , larger discrepancies occur for weaker friction and lower barriers , a range beyond the strict applicability of the analytical treatments .",
    "[ rgammascalingfig ]    figure  [ rgammascalingfig ] presents a comparison between the measured and the predicted asymmetry in the switching rates of the josephson junction in presence of a current in the tunnel junction .",
    "the data of the left pannel ( a ) correspond to the intermediate the switching exponent @xmath220 .",
    "the right panel ( b ) shows the theoretical predictions eq .",
    "( [ rateasymm ] ) for the same parameters , and assuming that the temperature is @xmath84 .",
    "the disagreement is significant , both in the magnitude ( asymmetries found in the experiment are larger than in theory ) and in the current - dependence . in particular , the increase of the asymmetry with @xmath83 is in strong contradiction with theory , which predicts a maximum when the shot noise due to the tunnel junction is similar in magnitude to the thermal noise seen at zero current .",
    "two reasons can be invoked for this disagreement : an imperfect modeling of the experiment by theory , or experimental artifacts .",
    "the experimental setup presents differences from the simplified circuit described by theory : the @xmath221 combination that allows in the experiment to separate low and high frequency fluctuations is not treated by theory ; the resistance @xmath40 in series with the tunnel junction also produces noise that modifies the voltage across the tunnel junction , a configuration in which feed - back effects lead to an asymmetry of the current fluctuations @xcite that has not been considered ; the voltage across the josephson junction has fluctuations due to plasma oscillations , leading to voltage fluctuations that have been neglected .",
    "at least this last point can be discarded , since the corresponding voltages @xmath222 are in the @xmath223 range .",
    "more work in necessary to analyze the effects of the two other main differences between experiment and theoretical modeling .",
    "[ totoleretour ]      we have also explored another possible source of asymmetry associated with an hypothetic imperfection in the experiment , namely a leak across one of the coupling capacitances @xmath41 or @xmath39 or a touch to ground of the corresponding bias line . in this case , a fraction @xmath224 of the dc current through the junction passes through the josephson junction instead of returning entirely through the resistor @xmath40 : at @xmath225 , the switching rate at @xmath226 is increased , whereas at at @xmath227 it is decreased .",
    "the corresponding asymmetry can be evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) with @xmath172 evaluated at @xmath228 for @xmath229 , one obtains @xmath230the best fit of the data with this expression in which the measured escape temperatures are plugged in , obtained with @xmath231 , is presented in fig .",
    "[ totoleretour]b .",
    "the general trend is well reproduced , but systematic deviations are observed for the data at @xmath94 and at currents above @xmath232 . in fig .",
    "[ totoleretour]a , we fitted the data with the conjugated effect of a leak and of the asymmetry expected from the third order cumulant of the current fluctuations ( replacing again the effective temperature @xmath233 by the measured escape temperature ) . in the best fit , obtained with @xmath234 all the data",
    "are precisely accounted for .",
    "if this scenario is the correct one , the asymmetry due to the tunnel junction is clearly seen in the data at the lowest bath temperature , but the uncertainty is too large for other temperatures .",
    "the value of @xmath224 corresponds to a leak resistance of @xmath235 ( @xmath236 ) if the leak comes from the capacitor @xmath39 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the capacitors were tested after fabrication , but a leak might have appeared afterwards .",
    "a touch to ground of the corresponding connection line at this intermediate value seems unlikely .",
    "in conclusion , we have measured the switching rate of a josephson junction when coupled to a voltage - biased nis junction .",
    "the main effect is a well explained increase of the escape temperature due to shot noise through the junction .",
    "the asymmetry of the rates for opposite signs of the bias of the nis junction is larger than expected from the dynamics of the josephson junction in presence of non - gaussian noise .",
    "part of the discrepancy might be due to an oversimplification in the modelling of the circuit .",
    "it is however suspected that a current leak through a capacitor , is responsible for a large fraction of the signal .",
    "experiments less prone to experimental artifacts , with an improved decoupling of the detector from the noise source at dc , are in progress .",
    "for each current pulse we recorded the boolean @xmath237 or @xmath238 depending whether the voltage across the josephson junction crossed the threshold or not .",
    "the booleans are @xmath100 independent random variables @xmath239 with binomial distribution , @xmath70 being the expectation for @xmath240 .",
    "therefore , the standard deviation of the average @xmath241 is @xmath242 . and using @xmath243one gets the standard deviation of the switching rate @xmath244therefore , the uncertainty on the measurement of @xmath99 is given by ( see eq .
