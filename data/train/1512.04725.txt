    "<S> the qd excitonic transition is tuned in resonance with the laser energy where a strong fluorescence signal is observed . away from resonance , a faint emission at the exciton energy is still observed due to phonon assisted processes . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism leading to an exciton emission in crossed polarization can be seen as follows : the laser drives the v polarized exciton state @xmath16 which correspond to a linear superposition of x and y excitons state @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this superposition temporally evolves as @xmath18 , eventually leading to an emission along h polarization . </S>",
    "<S> to theoretically account for the experiment , a model schematically described in fig 2b and presented in details in the supplementary materials is developed . </S>",
    "<S> the qd is modeled as a v - type 3-level system ( i.e. the ground state @xmath19 and the two polarized excitons @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) . </S>",

    "<S> figure 2d - e presents the measured and calculated time dependences of the 56 ps excitation pulse ( blue ) and the h - polarized exciton emission ( red ) . the emission is temporally delayed from the excitation pulse in agreement with theoretical predictions : the smaller the fss , the longer the temporal evolution toward the orthogonal exciton state .    </S>",
    "<S> we now study the coherent control of the exciton by monitoring the time integrated h - polarized emission intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton population oscillates during the pulse , driven by the v polarized excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the h - polarized emission mostly takes place after the pulse as shown in figure 2d . </S>",
    "<S> when increasing the average power for a given pulse duration , the probability for the qd to be in the exciton state at the end of the pulse oscillates @xcite , resulting in oscillations in the h - polarized emission with the excitation power . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3a presents the time integrated h - polarized emission intensity as a function of the average power sent on the device ( top scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> clear rabi oscillations are evidenced for both 12 and 56 ps pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom scale of figure 3a shows the mean photon number @xmath22 per pulse sent on the device , derived from the average excitation power @xmath23 , the laser repetition rate @xmath24 and the photon energy @xmath25 : @xmath26 . only 3.8 ( 8.6 ) photons are sent on average at @xmath0-pulses for a pulse duration of 56 ( 12 ) ps . </S>",
    "<S> this extremely low photon number is obtained owing to the excellent mode matching between the incident gaussian beam and the fundamental mode of the micropillar , in contrast with photonic crystal cavities where the mode profile is difficult to control @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental observations are theoretically reproduced in figure 3b presenting the calculated h - polarized exciton emission as a function of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the model includes only the parameters extracted from figure 1e and assumes a perfect input coupling efficiency ( @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> an excellent agreement with the experimental observations is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> though these rabi oscillations demonstrate the few - photon coherent control of the exciton , it does not provide a direct measure of the probability to flip the exciton state . </S>",
    "<S> this flip probability can be derived from the theoretical model by calculating the probability of finding the qd in its excited state ( both h or v dipole ) as shown in figure 3c for the two pulse durations . at @xmath28pulse , sending 8.6 ( 3.8 ) photons is sufficient to flip the exciton qubit with a probability of 81% ( 62% ) depending on the pulse length . </S>",
    "<S> the flip probability is sligthly reduced for the longer pulse : rabi oscillations driven by the v excitation are damped by the spontaneous emission of the exciton in the v mode and by the time evolution toward the @xmath29 exciton state . with a purcell factor of 13 , corresponding to an emission decay time around 100 ps , spontaneous emission damping hardly plays a role for the 12 ps pulse , while oscillations are damped for a 56 ps pulse . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> more photons are needed with the 12 ps pulse , because of the lower spectral overlap between the excitation pulse and the exciton state .    </S>",
    "<S> such low photon number coherent control establishes a new state of the art for solid - state optical devices . </S>",
    "<S> until now , such efficient interface had only been reached with a single atom trapped in a cavity @xcite or close to fiber - coupled microresonator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated here for a micron - size semiconductor device produced with a fully deterministic and highly reproducible technology . to flip the exciton quantum bit with even lower photon numbers </S>",
    "<S> , two parameters should be considered . </S>",
    "<S> first , the current experiment uses attenuated coherent pulses : for a coherent pulse with @xmath30 , the probability that the pulse actually contains no photons is 1/e=36% . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3d presents the population of the qd excited state as a function of time comparing the case of an incident coherent state with @xmath30 and the case of a single photon fock state . to account for an incoming single photon wavepacket , the generalized master equation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is used ( see supplementary ) . </S>",
    "<S> a 44% increase of the probability to flip the quantum bit is expected : sending a single photon on the same device would ensure a probability to flip the exciton quantum bit with @xmath31 probability . </S>",
    "<S> the other parameter that increases the number of photons at @xmath0-pulse is specific to the present experiment . </S>",
    "<S> since the exciton state presents a sizeable fss , around @xmath32ev , the v exciton dipole rotates toward the h exciton dipole where efficient spontaneous emission into the h cavity mode takes place . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism contributes to damp the exciton population during the excitation , leading to a higher @xmath22 at @xmath0-pulse . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3f presents the average number of photon at @xmath0-pulse for three values of @xmath33 , as a function of the pulse duration . for each value of the @xmath33 , </S>",
    "<S> the mean photon number @xmath22 at @xmath0-pulse presents a minimum value . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller @xmath33 , the lower the minimal photon number @xmath22 is and the longer the optimal pulse .    </S>",
    "<S> we have reported on a highly efficient solid state interface between a flying and a stationary quantum bit . </S>",
    "<S> this has been obtained by deterministically inserting a qd in an electrically controlled pillar cavity that ensures both an excellent mode matching with incident gaussian beams and a state of the art cooperativity of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the device presented here has been designed to operate with a neutral exciton . </S>",
    "<S> similar cavities , coupled to a positively charged exciton , bring exciting perspectives to demonstrate new quantum functionalities . </S>",
    "<S> since the charged exciton optical resonance can be used to initialize the hole spin @xcite , manipulating a single spin with only a single photon is foreseeable using the present technology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such efficient spin - photon interface would open the way to deterministic quantum gates between delayed photons as well as cluster state generation @xcite .    * </S>",
