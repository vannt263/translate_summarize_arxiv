    "quantum spin liquids ( qsls ) are elusive magnets without magnetism , resisting symmetry breaking even at zero temperature due to strong quantum fluctuations and geometric frustration @xcite .",
    "the simplest qsls known theoretically are characterized by topological order@xcite , and support fractionalized excitations including spinons , which carry the spin ( 1/2 ) but not the charge of the electron .",
    "since the qsl state was suggested by anderson@xcite , it has been sought , mostly unsuccessfully , in models and materials .",
    "however , exciting indications of qsl ground states were recently reported in numerical studies of models on the honeycomb@xcite and kagome@xcite lattices . here",
    "we report strong evidence for a qsl state in the square lattice @xmath1-@xmath2 antiferromagnetic ( afm ) heisenberg model , with the hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the spin-@xmath10 operator on site @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes nearest neighbors ( next nearest neighbors ) . in the following we set @xmath14 as the unit of energy , and",

    "accordingly , it is among the most studied models in frustrated quantum magnetism@xcite .",
    "these previous studies have established the existence of a non - magnetic ground state between the nel and striped afm states which occur for small and large @xmath2 , respectively .    to characterize the non - magnetic phase",
    ", we can ask two main types of questions .",
    "first , we may ask about its symmetries .",
    "being non - magnetic , the ground state retains the internal su(2 ) spin - rotation invariance , but it may break spatial ones . if su(2 )",
    "is preserved but spatial symmetries are broken in such a way that the unit cell is enlarged , the system is said to have valence bond solid ( vbs ) order .",
    "second , we may ask about the range of entanglement of the wavefunction .",
    "the simplest representative wavefunctions for vbs states are continuously deformable by local unitary transformations into product states .",
    "such is true for typical ground state wavefunctions for systems with broken discrete symmetries ( the space group of a lattice is discrete ) . as such ,",
    "these wavefunctions have only short - range entanglement ( schrdinger cat states are possible in finite systems and will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : topol - entang - entr ] ) .",
    "wavefunctions which _ can not _ be continuously transformed in this way into product states may be said to exhibit _ long - range entanglement_. this is true for all gapless critical phases , as well as for some gapped states .",
    "in particular , gapped qsl states exhibit a particularly simple type of long - range entanglement , characterized by _",
    "topological entanglement entropy _",
    ". often the two types of characterization are conflated , but this is not necessarily the case .",
    "states with both long range entanglement , e.g. with tee , _ and _ vbs order exist .",
    "such states , while not technically qsls by the standard definition given above , have all the same exotic physics as qsls with unbroken spatial symmetry .",
    "we note , however , that it is believed that for s=1/2 spins on a lattice such as this one with an odd number of spins per unit cell , the _ absence _ of vbs order _ implies _ the presence of long - range entanglement .",
    "therefore a convincing demonstration of vanishing vbs order does , indirectly , imply interesting qsl physics .",
    "it is , however , less important to characterizing and proving the existence of a qsl than positive , direct evidence of long - range entanglement .",

    "changing the coupling parameter @xmath4 , three different phases are found : n@xmath17el antiferromagnet ( afm ) , topological quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) , and stripe afm phase . @xmath18 [ @xmath19 denotes the staggered magnetization in the n@xmath17el afm phase [ stripe afm phase ] , whose saturation value is @xmath10 . @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the spin singlet gap and spin triplet gap , respectively.,width=326,height=192 ]    most of the literature on the intermediate phase of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model has focused on the possibility of symmetry breaking vbs order .",
    "many of these prior studied have suggested that the intermediate state has vbs order .",
    "we note , however , that all numerical results for the @xmath1-@xmath2 model are based either on biased techniques ( such as series expansion or coupled cluster methods , or fixed node or related versions of monte carlo adapted to avoid the sign problem which is present for unbiased monte carlo in this system ) , or on exact diagonalization of very small systems . some _ theoretical _ motivation for the possibility of",
    "vbs order comes from the theory of deconfined quantum criticality@xcite , which predicts that a continuous quantum phase transition  a deconfined quantum critical point ( dqcp )  should occur between an ordered nel state and a plaquette or columnar vbs state , _ in some models_. however , the existence of such a transition does not in any way imply that it occurs for the @xmath1-@xmath2 model in question , or that this particular model even harbors a vbs phase .",
    "other theoretical motiviation for vbs order comes from its presence in some large-@xmath22 generalizations of the nearest - neighbor heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "however , these large @xmath22 studies are not controllably close to the su(2 ) case and moreover do not consider second neighbor interactions .",
    "in short , we believe there is very little compelling evidence for the existence of vbs order in the isotropic @xmath23 @xmath1-@xmath2 model to be found in the prior literature .",
    "we will return to discuss vbs states in sec .",
    "[ sec : boundary - effects ] .",
    "the _ only _ unbiased technique capable of treating generic frustrated two dimensional spin systems of moderately large size is the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method.@xcite while the sizes that can be studied using the dmrg are not as large as those accessibly by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) for _ unfrustrated _ models , they are still very large and they are not limited by the sign problem , which prevents application of qmc to most realistic physical models . moreover , the dmrg has some advantages over qmc : it is intrinsically a zero temperature technique , and obtains a convenient representation of the ground state wavefunction .",
    "most importantly for our purposes , the dmrg is very efficient and convenient for calculating the entanglement entropy , which we return to in some detail below . in this paper",
    ", we report the results of extensive simulations ( with truncation error @xmath24 ) on numerous cylinders of circumference @xmath25 , and lengths @xmath26 . in our simulations",
    ", we measure spin - spin correlation functions , correlation functions and expectation values of vbs order parameters , bulk singlet and triplet energy gaps , and entanglement entropy .",
    "all results confirm the existence of magnetic order for small and large @xmath2 , and that ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediagram ] ) the ground state for @xmath27 is non - magnetic , in very good agreement with the most accurate prior results from series expansion and coupled cluster@xcite methods .",
    "furthermore , we find that the intermediate phase has a gap to both singlet and triplet excitations and , within our uncertainty , _ no _ vbs order in the 2d limit as extrapolated from the vbs correlation functions .",
    "we carry out further checks for possible finite - size effects due to the boundaries , to see if this might artificially suppress vbs order , and see no indication that this is the case .",
    "the latter results suggests a qsl state , based on negative evidence : the apparent absence of vbs order .",
    "we find two _ positive _ evidences that this suggestion is correct , and that the state is a @xmath7 qsl .",
    "first , we find a non - zero tee , @xmath28 , which is a constant and universal _ reduction _ of the von neumann entanglement entropy , known to vanish in any gapped state with short - range entanglement .",
    "notably , we point out in sec .  [",
    "sec : topol - entang - entr ] that discrete spontaneous symmetry breaking phases such as valence bond solids have absolute ground states which are schrdinger cat states with a constant _ enhancement _ of the entanglement entropy  i.e. an effect of _ opposite sign _ to the tee .",
    "phases with non - zero @xmath28 and a gap to all excitations are _",
    "topological phases_. like conformal field theories in two dimensions , only discrete types of topological phases exist , with discrete allowed values of @xmath28 ( which plays a role somewhat similar to the central charge in a conformal field theory ) .",
    "for all points we have studied within the non - magnetic phase , the value of @xmath28 is equal , within numerical uncertainty of @xmath29 , to @xmath30 , which is the _ minimal _ value possible for @xmath28 in a topological phase with time - reversal symmetry .",
    "a topological entanglement entropy of @xmath31 implies either a @xmath7 qsl or a `` doubled semion '' phase@xcite . as there is , to our knowledge , no theory suggesting the appearance of the semion phase in an su(2 ) invariant spin-@xmath10 model , we take this as strong evidence for a @xmath7 qsl state .",
    "the second positive evidence for a @xmath7 qsl is a remarkable odd / even effect , in which static vbs order is entirely absent for even @xmath16 but is observed directly in the vbs expectation values for odd @xmath16 .",
    "this is expected on general theoretical grounds for a @xmath7 qsl , as we show in appendix  [ sec : stagg - dimer ] .",
    "we compare the behavior of the numerically observed static vbs order for odd circumference cylinders with theory , and find quite consistent results .",

    "in this section we discuss the behavior of correlation functions of spin and dimer ( vbs ) operators . here and in the rest of the paper , all our numerical data",

    "for instance , in computing spin correlation functions @xmath39 , we restrict site indices @xmath11 and @xmath40 to the central half of the system so that the obtained correlation functions could represent the bulk properties .",

    "more conservatively , at a minimum , the result indicates that the vbs correlations we observe can not be distinguished from just _ fluctuation _ effects in a state with unbroken spatial symmetry , and there is no a priori reason to regard them as evidence of true vbs order .",

    "we would , however , expect a strong vbs state to have a triplon excitation , corresponding to breaking one singlet bond , as the lowest energy bulk excitation , lower than singlet excitations which require breaking two singlets .",
    "so we can exclude a strong vbs state in this sense based on the excitation spectrum .",
    "the above results provide evidence _ against _ conventional ordering in the intermediate region .",
    "magnetic ordering appears comfortably excluded by both the correlation function and excitation spectrum analysis .",

    "we now undertake a _ positive _ evidence for a qsl with topological order  the topological entanglement entropy .",
    "the topological entanglement entropy is obtained from the von neumann entanglement entropy @xmath87 .",

    ". then the entanglement entropy @xmath92 . for a system with a gap to all bulk excitations ( as we have verified in sec .",
    "[ sec : energy - gaps ] ) , provided the boundary between @xmath89 and @xmath90 is taken to be smooth ( i.e. have no corners ) , the entanglement entropy must scale according to @xmath93 where the omitted terms vanish in the large @xmath94 limit . here",
    "@xmath95 is a non - universal number that measures the local entanglement across the boundary . according to refs .",
    ", the _ positive _ term @xmath28 is _ universal _ constant reduction from the area law.@xcite it arises entirely from non - local entanglement , and is topological in origin . in particular , the area law is _ strictly _ obeyed , i.e. @xmath96 , for any state without long - range entanglement , that is , which can be smoothly deformed into a product state .",
    "this is true , in the absence of spontaneously broken symmetry , for any ground state which does not exhibit topological order , i.e. which is not a topological qsl.@xcite although it is not discussed in the seminal papers on topological entanglement entropy , a non - zero _ negative _ @xmath28 ( i.e. a positive correction to the area law ) _ can _ arise from discrete spontaneous symmetry breaking ( more severe positive corrections to the area law arise in the case of a continuous broken symmetry,@xcite but this is inconsistent with the existence of a gap to bulk excitations ) . in particular , in an ideal model with an exact discrete symmetry of the hamiltonian , the eigenstates must form irreducible representations of the symmetry group . for simple abelian groups such as @xmath97 , these representations are one dimensional , so this implies the hamiltonian eigenstates are mutual eigenstates of the symmetry generators .",
    "this applies of course to the absolute ground state of the system , which is therefore a schrdinger cat state , which superimposes the symmetry broken global ground states with equal weight . for the case of a fully broken @xmath97 symmetry , with",
    "@xmath22 degenerate ground states in the thermodynamic limit , this gives rise to @xmath22 terms in the schmidt decomposition of the ground state , and therefore a correction @xmath98 , i.e. a positive correction to the area law or @xmath99 .",
    "we have indeed observed such behavior numerically in test studies of the simplest quantum transverse field ising model in the ferromagnetic phase , consistent with the expected @xmath100 for this case .",
    "thus we see that there are two potential sources of a non - zero constant term in the entanglement entropy . a topological contribution which _ decreases _ the entropy , and a symmetry breaking contribution which _ increases _ it .",
    "the latter correction arises from _ global _ entanglement of the entire system . in work",
    "completed since the earlier version of this article appeared,@xcite it has been shown that the dmrg , which is a minimum entanglement approximation , tends to converge , for large systems , to quasi - ground states which capture all entanglement out to a long length scale , but not the last global entanglement .",
    "that is , for long systems , the convergence of the dmrg is first to a",
    "_ minimum entanglement state _ ( mes ) amongst the manifold of states comprising the degenerate ground states in the thermodynamic limit@xcite .",
    "for topologically ordered phases , which have a ground state degeneracy in the thermodynamic limit of topological origin , the mes exhibits the universal reduction of entanglement entropy , i.e. the universal positive value of @xmath28 . for symmetry broken states ,",
    "for which there is a ground state degeneracy in the thermodynamic limit dictated by symmetry , the mes is simply a single product - like state , with @xmath96 . as shown by jiang , wang and balents in ref .",
    ", for a fixed system size which is not too large , the dmrg can be pushed to converge to the global ground state , by increasing the number of states @xmath101 .",
    "this is accompanied in these cases by a sharp _ increase _ in the entanglement entropy . by increasing the length @xmath102 of the system at fixed @xmath16 ,",
    "this final increase in the entanglement entropy can be pushed beyond the range of feasible calculations , and the simulation is guaranteed to obtain the mes . in the mes , the constant correction @xmath28 is entirely of topological origin , and is zero in discrete symmetry breaking states .",
    "thus in this limit @xmath28 _ is _ the topological entanglement entropy , and a non - zero result proves that the state is a ( topological ) qsl .",
    "moreover , we see from the above discussion that a positive @xmath28 can only come from topological order , so we do not obtain false positive signatures of topological order from symmetry breaking .     and @xmath103 . ( a )",

    "( b ) length dependence of the entanglement entropy for @xmath111 and several system widths .",
    "one observes that the entropy is almost independent of @xmath102 for long systems ( a small increase with @xmath102 can be observed for the smallest @xmath102 at @xmath112 ) . ,",

    "for instance , the simplest mean - field treatment of the q term in the j - q@xmath131 model would proceed from by decoupling it by defining a mean - field dimer expectation value of the dimer operator , and thereby a vbs phase appears when the q term becomes substantial .",
    "thus it is natural and intuitive to expect a vbs phase in the j - q models .",
    "by contrast , there is no a priori reason to expect dimer order in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "the notion that a vbs state is somehow the most `` likely '' candidate for the intermediate non - magnetic state in the @xmath1-@xmath2 case is a misleading starting point .",
    "more importantly , we should be cautious in drawing conclusions from the j - q models on the behavior of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "the most direct evidence for a qsl state we have obtained is the topological entanglement entropy , remarkably close to the universal expected value for a @xmath7 qsl . in ref .",
    ", sandvik suggests that `` it would not be surprising '' if a system near a nel to vbs transition ( i.e. a dqcp ) would exhibit a constant correction to the area law similar to that expected for a topological phase .",
    "in fact , we have shown theoretically that in a vbs state , there is indeed a constant correction _ but of opposite sign _ to that of a topological phase .",
    "thus even forgetting the magnitude of @xmath28 , the sign alone is a strong argument against vbs order .",
    "the fact that the measured @xmath28 is within 2% of the very beautiful and universal expected result @xmath30 makes it hard to imagine this is mere coincidence .    in the context of a putative dqcp",
    ", the constant correction for a vbs state obtains if the system size is larger than the `` deconfinement length '' , below which there is an emergent u(1 ) symmetry unifying the plaquette and columnar vbs states , and linear combinations in between , with one another .",
    "would one perhaps see a signal similar to the topological entanglement entropy were this length longer than the system size ?",
    "actually in this case we expect that the system should appear to exhibit a gapless goldstone mode , characteristic of spontaneously breaking this u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "this is the situation discussed in refs .. in fact the behavior of the entanglement entropy in this case is even further from that of a topological phase : a _ positive _ logarithmic enhancement of the entanglement entropy beyond the area law is predicted , again of opposite sign to the topological case . moreover , in the 1d limit , @xmath132 , the system should behave as a 1 + 1-dimensional conformal field theory with central charge @xmath133 , and hence exhibit a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy , @xmath134 , in such a case .",

    "small details of the data for the latter case for the smallest systems , @xmath141 , are used to conclude that the system is vbs ordered in the infinite - size limit .",
    "we disagree .",
    "first , note the simple fact that the dimerization for the @xmath1-@xmath2 model is much smaller than that of the @xmath135-@xmath136 model ( which is the more weakly vbs ordered of the two j - q models ) .",

    "while this is certainly consistent with a @xmath7 state , one could imagine similar behavior arising in a system with vbs order in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "when confined to a cylinder , the anisotropy of the boundary conditions breaks the symmetry between the horizontal and vertical states . for the case of odd - width cylinders ,",
    "the vertical dimerization is frustrated , because alternating `` rows '' of vertical dimers do not fit into the sample .",
    "this clearly would favor the horizontal dimer states .",
    "amongst the two horizontal dimer states , the presence of an end to the system splits the remaining degeneracy , so all degeneracy is broken and we would expect long - range horizontal dimer order to appear .",
    "to this extent , the behavior for odd - width cylinders is the same as observed in our numerics , and as expected for the @xmath7 qsl .",
    "the difference is in the scaling .",
    "if the 2d system has a gapped dimer ground state , we would expect the expectation value of the dimerization to converge exponentially to a non - zero two dimensional limit as the width of the cylinder increases , i.e. @xmath150 where @xmath89 and @xmath151 are constants , and @xmath152 is the value of the dimer order parameter in the thermodynamic limit .    as shown in fig.[fig : dimercheck](c ) , the numerical fitting to this form gives @xmath153 within numerical accuracy .",
    "this is entirely consistent with vanishing vbs order and a @xmath7 qsl in the thermodynamic limit , but of course can not exclude some weak dimerization smaller than our numerical uncertainties .",
    "it seems to us natural to take the former interpretation , since it is simpler . according to the theory for the @xmath7 qsl discussed in appendix  [ sec : stagg - dimer ] and quantum dimer model results@xcite , an exponential decay for the staggered dimerization",
    "is expected with `` doubled '' correlation length @xmath154 , where @xmath128 is the true vbs correlation length .",
    "we find @xmath155 lattice spacings , which is equivalent via eq .   to @xmath129 .    for the even circumference cylinders ,",
    "the vertical dimer order is unfrustrated , and it is an energetic question , which likely depends upon the details of the model , whether the vertical or horizontal dimer order would be favored in this case .",
    "if the horizontal dimer state is favored , then we again expect behavior like eq .  ,",
    "which is manifestly inconsistent with our numerics , and markedly different from the @xmath7 qsl .",
    "however , it is perfectly conceivable that the vertical dimer pattern is favored instead .",
    "if so , the periodic boundary conditions do not break the symmetry between the two vertical dimer states , and so we expect the dmrg to converge to the symmetric linear combination of the two dimer states , which lacks any spontaneous dimer pattern .",
    "so at least the presence of an even - odd effect in the static dimerization is consistent with a vbs state , if the cylindrical geometry favors the two vbs states with horizontal rows of vertical dimers . on the face of it",
    ", this appears consistent with our numerical results _ for the staggered dimerization _ , if one assumes that the value of the dimerization itself ( extrapolated from odd circumference cylinders ) is smaller than our numerical uncertainty .",
    "but it is worth pointing out that for this scenario to hold , the even circumference system must be in a schrdinger cat state , and should exhibit a positive @xmath30 enhancement of the entanglement entropy ( negative tee ) as a consequence , and moreover convergence to such a state should be progressively more difficult with increasing @xmath102 . this is not at all what we see .      in ref .",
    ", strong boundary effects are observed on the dimerization in the j - q models .",
    "indeed , on symmetry grounds , an open end breaks translation and reflection symmetries in the @xmath33 direction , and as such should act as a `` boundary field '' on the staggered dimer order @xmath126 , i.e. it induces a term @xmath156 in a landau theory of this order . on these grounds",
    ", we always expect some staggered dimer order near the boundary .",
    "if it is energetically disfavored in the bulk , this will decay rapidly .",
    "otherwise , it will penetrate deep into the bulk . in the j - q models",
    ", it was found that the boundaries induce a quite strong dimerization , so that _ for even @xmath16 _ the bond expectation values @xmath157 oscillate visibly ( c.f . in the inset of fig .",
    "6 , and in fig .",
    "15a of ref .",
    ", the bond expectation value shows oscillations with large amplitude in the j - q@xmath158 and j - q@xmath131 models , respectively ) .",
    "by contrast , in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : dimercheck](b ) that there are no visible oscillations in the same quantity when @xmath16 is even .",
    "this qualitative difference tells us that @xmath126 order is clearly much less favorable in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "we next try to address the possibility , raised above , that the cylindrical geometry when @xmath16 is even favors @xmath159 order , i.e. horizontal rows of vertical dimers .",
    "this is at odds with our measurements of the dimer correlations and the entanglement entropy .",
    "still , it is more compelling to explicitly test to rule out the possibility directly .",
    "to do so , we have studied several modified cylinders with even circumference , in which the ends of the cylinder have been altered , breaking translational symmetry along @xmath34 in order to break the degeneracy and favor one of the two vertical dimer states .",
    "what we observe is that in all cases , as shown in fig.[fig : dimercheck](d ) , although dimer order is induced by this symmetry breaking in the vicinity of the boundary , it decays exponentially into the bulk of the cylinder .",
    "the correlation length @xmath160 for this vertical dimer order still depends on circumference for the system sizes in our study , so we plot it versus @xmath16 to see if it is limited by the system size ( it does not appear to be ) , and to extrapolate from this its value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we observe that this correlation length grows sub - linearly in @xmath16 , and extrapolates to @xmath161 in the 2d limit ( i.e. , @xmath162 ) .",
    "this is very different from what would be expected for a 2d state with long - range dimer order , in which the non - zero stiffness ( surface tension ) of the ordered dimer state would prevent such decay ( we would expect @xmath163 in this case ) . if one were to imagine that the system were proximate to a dqcp , and @xmath16 were smaller than the deconfinement length , then we would instead expect @xmath164 , which again is not consistent with our results .",
    "note also that the value for @xmath160 is quite consistent with the value for @xmath151 obtained earlier .",
    "the fact that vertical dimer order decays away , even when the most favorable conditions have been created for it , is strong evidence against vbs order in the 2d limit .      in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented compelling evidence from accurate dmrg calculations for a topological qsl state in the two dimensional @xmath1-@xmath2 heisenberg model .",
    "this is the simplest example of such a qsl discovered to date , and the only one to our knowledge for a heisenberg model on a bravais lattice . as such",
    ", it is particularly attractive for further theoretical and experimental study .",
    "we anticipate , for instance , that our discovery will afford an opportunity to explore the qsl mechanism of unconventional superconductivity@xcite in a controlled theoretical setting .",
    "another consequence of topological order is the presence of quasi - degenerate ground states on the torus or cylinder .",
    "a two - fold quasi - degeneracy is expected for a @xmath7 qsl on the cylinder studied here , with a splitting of order @xmath165 in the case of long cylinders , where @xmath128 is the spin - spin correlation length ( see appendix  [ sec : ground - state - degen ] ) . as shown in ref . and discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : topol - entang - entr ] , the dmrg preferentially converges , however , to just _ one _ of the quasi - degenerate ground states ( specifically , a minimally entangled state ) .",
    "this explains the absence of an observed topological degeneracy in this and other dmrg studies.@xcite it is a non - trivial and open problem to obtain the second ground state and thereby extract the topological energy splitting .",
    "it is our expectation that it is actually orders of magnitude smaller than the bulk energy gaps .",
    "the nature of the quantum phase transitions from the qsl to nel and striped antiferromagnetic phases is an interesting topic for future study .",
    "though we have not focused on the transitions themselves , and more work is clearly required to make strong conclusions about them numerically , it appears that the transition from the nel to qsl state may be continuous .",
    "erroneously claims that a nel to qsl transition might be in the same universality class as the dqcp between nel and vbs order , because `` the operator causing the vbs order is dangerously invariant '' .",
    "though at the dqcp the operator which _ distinguishes _ between columnar and plaquette vbs order is dangerously _ irrelevant _ , even when this operator s coefficient in the hamiltonian is tuned to zero , the non - magnetic phase has spontaneous vbs order .",
    "so this claim is incorrect .",
    "in fact , such a transition requires an entirely different theory .",

    "indeed , both are largely independent of the microscopic model , and give the _ minimal _ set of excitations and their properties gives only the assumptions of @xmath7 topological order in the ground state and half - integer spin per unit cell",
    ". it would be interesting to understand if other dimer patterns could in principle arise , if the low energy vison states were selected from a different projective symmetry group.@xcite in two dimensions , in the @xmath7 qsl phase , there is no vbs order , so the visons are gapped and the vbs order parameter @xmath259 also is uncondensed , correspondingly .",

    "the latter result can be readily understood in terms of the vbs order parameter : on an odd - leg cylinder , the vertical component @xmath159 is frustrated ( staggering of rows of dimers does not `` fit '' ) and should be antiperiodic , which requires @xmath262 under the circuit around the cylinder , consistent with the anti - periodic boundary conditions on @xmath261 .",
    "since the visons are gapped , the antiperiodic boundary condition gives an exponentially small effect in the thermodynamic limit , but it is non - zero and can be readily calculated .",

    "let us conclude this subsection with one remark on the dimer correlation lengths .",
    "the static dimerization on cylinders with odd circumference decays with an apparent correlation length @xmath274 .",
    "this is _ not _ the same length which appears in the dimer - dimer correlation function .",
    "the latter is obtained from correlation functions of @xmath259 , given in eq .  .",
    "because the dimer order parameter @xmath259 is quadratic in the vison fields @xmath253 , and the @xmath253 are gaussian distributed , by wick s theorem the dimer - dimer correlation functions are _ squares _ of vison green s functions . consequently , the exponential decay of the dimer - dimer correlation function , which defines the standard dimer correlation length @xmath128 , is twice as fast , i.e. @xmath275 this behavior has indeed been observed in the numerical studies in the main text .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath7 spin liquid has degenerate ground states in the thermodynamic limit on a cylinder or torus . for the cylindrical geometry studied here ,",
    "two states are expected . here",
    "we would like to understand the scaling of the gap between these two states , and also better understand their character .",
    "we will see that , as discussed e.g. in ref.@xcite , that the presence of gapped spin excitations ( which carry non - zero electric gauge charge ) makes a _ qualitative _ difference in these properties .",
    "this means that models neglecting these excitations , in particular the very popular quantum dimer models , actually give _",
    "incorrect _ or _",
    "non - generic _ scaling for the finite - size quasi - degenerate gap .",
    "consider first the pure gauge theory , eq .  ,",
    "in which coupling to matter fields is neglected .",
    "the ground state degree of freedom may be regarded as the presence or absence of a vison through the hole in the cylinder .",
    "the presence of the vison itself is measured by the wilson loop operator around the cylinder , @xmath276 a state with a @xmath7 vortex in it has @xmath277 and without has @xmath278 .",
    "however , the ground state will not be an eigenstate of @xmath279 .",
    "in fact , consider the conjugate operator @xmath280 this operator _ commutes _ with @xmath188 defined in eq .",
    ", and so is a constant of the motion .",
    "the two degenerate ground states have @xmath281 ( we can pick any @xmath34 , since others are related by eq .  ) .",
    "note that @xmath282 , so an eigenstate of @xmath130 is a symmetric or antisymmetric combination of the @xmath279 ( vison ) eigenstates .",
    "this indicates physically that the vison may tunnel through the cylinder , by moving ( virtually ) through the entire long length @xmath16 from one end to another , thereby connecting the @xmath278 and @xmath277 states . the tunneling amplitude for this process",
    "is naturally expected to be exponential in the length of the event , so we postulate that the gap in this case is @xmath283 .",
    "this has been shown explicitly in many places in the literature .",
    "this result is generic for the pure @xmath7 gauge theory , and continues to hold even if longer ( but finite ) range plaquette and electric field terms are included .",
    "it relies only on the fact that @xmath130 does not create any physical gauge flux through finite plaquettes .",
    "however , if a matter field ( i.e. the spinons ) is present , the result is modified . to see this ,",
    "let us imagine more carefully integrating out the spinons in going from eq .   to eq .",
    ", for the case of a cylinder of finite circumference . then we will obtain not only contributions from small loops ( which renormalize @xmath284 etc . ) , but also , occuring first at @xmath285 , contributions from loops which encircle the cylinder . keeping just the leading of these terms , we have the slight modification of eq .",
    "@xmath286 where we expect @xmath287 , which physically is related to the amplitude for a virtual spinon to encircle the cylinder . note that in this case @xmath130 no longer commutes with @xmath188 , and the nature of the eigenstates is no longer clear . now",
    "if we assume @xmath288 and that for @xmath289 we are in the deconfined @xmath7 phase , we can project the hamiltonian on the low - energy sector of the pure gauge theory , i.e. the two level system of the quasi - degenerate states .",
    "then we obtain the effective hamiltonian , written in a pseudo - spin notation in which @xmath290 correspond to the vison / no - vison states : @xmath291 since @xmath283 and @xmath287 , the nature of the ground state depends crucially on the aspect ratio of the cylinder . for a fat cylinder , with small @xmath292 ,",
    "for which @xmath293 , the eigenstates will be like those of the pure gauge theory , and the gap will be exponentially small in @xmath102 .",
    "however , for a `` long '' cylinder , with larger @xmath292 , the gap will be exponential instead in @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , strictly in the limit of large @xmath102 and @xmath16 fixed , the higher energy state can no longer be regarded as quasi - degenerate : its energy , relative to the ground state , grows linearly with @xmath102 , and so other states with local , non - topological excitations will have lower energy . the conditions for @xmath294 to dominate are much less restrictive than this , however , requiring only @xmath295 , or @xmath296 . in this limit",
    ", the ground state is an approximate eigenstate of @xmath297 , i.e. a state of definite vison number . because of the quasi - one - dimensional nature of the dmrg technique , in the most effective regime of this technique , this is the expected form of the ground state .",
    "note again that this regime is missed by the pure gauge theory and also the quantum dimer model .",
    "the nature of the absolute ground state obtained by dmrg has implications for the entanglement entropy . as shown recently by zhang _",
    "et al_@xcite , the topological entanglement entropy for a cut with non - trivial topology actually depends upon the choice of quasi - degenerate wavefunction .",
    "the cylindrical cut studied here is precisely such a cut .",
    "the results of ref.@xcite imply that the topological entanglement entropy reaches its maximum and universal value ( of @xmath298 ) when the ground state is a vison eigenstate , and takes a smaller ( in magitude ) value for other superpositions of states , _ vanishing _ for the case of a vison superposition , as is obtained in the absence of spinons .",
    "thus the result of our numerical study in the main text , in which we found rough agreement with the @xmath298 value for the topological entanglement entropy , in fact is evidence for such a vison eigenstate in the numerics , consistent with the predicted effects of virtual spin fluctuations ."
