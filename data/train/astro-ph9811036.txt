    "as our nearest galactic neighbors , the magellanic clouds offer a unique opportunity to study the effects of different galactic environments on dust properties . their importance has increased with the recent discovery that the dust in starburst galaxies appears to be similar to that in the star forming bar of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( calzetti et .",
    "al . 1994 ; gordon , calzetti & witt 1997 , gordon & clayton 1998 [ gc ] ) .",
    "understanding dust extinction properties in nearby galaxies is a useful tool in interpreting and modeling observations in a wide range of extragalactic systems .",
    "previous studies of the lmc extinction have all arrived at similar conclusions , e.g. the average lmc extinction curve is characterized by a weaker 2175   bump and a stronger far  uv rise than the average galactic extinction curve .",
    "two early studies ( nandy et .",
    "1981 ; koornneef & code 1981 ) found little spatial variation in the lmc extinction and computed an average lmc extinction curve .",
    "however , both samples were dominated by stars near the 30 doradus star forming region and it was thus unclear whether their average curves applied to the lmc as a whole .",
    "a study by clayton & martin ( 1985 ) expanded the sample to include a larger number of non30 dor stars and reported tentative evidence for differences between the extinction curves observed in the 30 dor region and the rest of the lmc .",
    "fitzpatrick ( 1985 , hereafter f85 ) expanded the number of available reddened stars to 19 including 7 outside of the 30 dor region , allowing a more detailed analysis of regional variations .",
    "f85 found a significant difference between the uv extinction characteristic of the 30 dor region and that outside the 30 dor region .",
    "the average 30 dor uv extinction curve was found to have a lower bump strength and stronger far  uv rise ( @xmath02 units at @xmath1m@xmath2 ) than the non30 dor stars .",
    "fitzpatrick ( 1986 , hereafter f86 ) expanded the sample by 8 lightly reddened stars located outside the 30 dor region and confirmed the results of f85 .",
    "clayton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) measured the extinction of two lmc stars , one in 30 dor and one outside 30 dor down to @xmath0 1000  .",
    "both extensions seem to be consistent with extrapolations of the iue extinction curves to shorter wavelengths .    as part of a program to quantify the range of extinction behavior in the local group",
    ", we have reanalyzed the extinction in the magellanic clouds . in particular ,",
    "no analysis has been done since the discovery that the uv extinction along most galactic sightlines could be described by one parameter , the ratio of total  to  selective extinction , @xmath3 ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 , hereafter ccm ) .",
    "it is of great interest whether such a relation exists for the magellanic clouds . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the results for the lmc .",
    "an analysis of the smc extinction appears in gc .",
    "our initial sample of reddened stars consisted of that defined by f85 . in an effort to expand the sample we searched the updated electronic catalog of rousseau et .",
    "al . ( 1978 ) , available via the simbad database , which consists of @xmath4 lmc stars .",
    "two initial cuts of the catalog were made : ( 1 ) stars with spectral types later than b4 were discarded and ( 2 ) we required @xmath5 .",
    "the first criterion limits the effects of spectral type mismatches in the resulting extinction curves , which can be quite large for spectral types later than about b3 ( e.g. f85 ) .",
    "the second criterion removes unreddened or lightly reddened stars from consideration .",
    "we note that all the f85 stars were included in the resulting sample of @xmath6 stars while none of the f86 stars were included as they all had @xmath7 .",
    "we then eliminated emission line stars and composite ",
    "spectrum objects from our list .",
    "the remaining stars were checked against the iue database and all of those for which both long and short wavelength low - dispersion spectra existed ( 54 ) were examined in more detail .",
    "only five stars from this sample were found to be both significantly reddened and have high s / n iue spectra .",
    "these stars were added to our sample and their iue spectra are listed in table 1 .",
    "we selected 67 unreddened comparison stars from the sample of lmc supergiants in fitzpatrick ( 1988 ) for use in constructing extinction curves using the pair method ( massa , savage & fitzpatrick 1983 ) .",
    "approximate uv spectral types for all of our reddened stars and their respective comparison stars ( see below for a discussion of the selection of extinction pairs ) were estimated from a visual comparison of the iue spectra to the grid of lmc stars with uv spectral types given in neubig & bruhweiler ( 1998 ) .",
    "the estimated uv spectral types are reported in table 2 .",

    "as pointed out by several authors ( e.g. schwering & israel 1991 ; oestreicher , gochermann , & schmidt  kaler 1995 ) , the galactic foreground towards the lmc is quite variable ranging from @xmath9 to 0.17 .",
    "schwering & israel ( 1991 ) constructed a foreground reddening map towards the lmc using hi data and a relationship between @xmath10 and the hi column density .",
    "they examined the f85 and f86 stars at a spatial resolution of 48  ( the resolution of the hi data ) and found systematically higher galactic foreground reddening associated with the comparison stars than the reddened stars .",
    "accounting for this systematic affect reduced the difference between the 30 dor and non30 dor extinction curves .",
    "oestreicher et .",
    "1995 ) used reddenings to @xmath11 lmc foreground stars to construct a galactic foreground reddening map with a resolution of @xmath010 .",
    "we have quantified the differences in galactic foreground reddening for our sample using the higher resolution map of oestreicher et .",
    "for all but one of our pairs in the 30 dor sample , the difference in the galactic foreground reddening between the reddened and comparison stars , @xmath12e(b@xmath8v)@xmath13 while for the non30 dor sample , @xmath12e(b@xmath8v)@xmath14 for all but one pair as well .",
    "there is no systematic difference in the foreground reddening between program and comparison stars in either sub  sample with the average @xmath15e(b@xmath8v)@xmath16 being near 0 for both samples .",
    "the values for the galactic foreground component of the reddening for each star used in the analysis is given in table 2 .",
    "for the two pairs with large foreground differences ( sk @xmath866 19/sk @xmath866 169 , sk @xmath869 228/sk @xmath865 15 ) we have estimated the maximum effect on the extinction curve to be less than the photometric uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we have not corrected the individual curves for the differences in the galactic foreground .",
    "extinction curves were constructed using the standard pair method ( e.g. massa , savage & fitzpatrick 1983 ) .",
    "short and long wavelength @xmath17 spectra were extracted using the @xmath17 newsips reduction , co  added , binned to the instrumental resolution of @xmath05     and merged at the maximum wavelength in the short wavelength spectrum .",
    "uncertainties in the extinction curve contain terms that depend both on the broadband photometric uncertainties as well as uncertainties in the @xmath17 fluxes .",
    "the flux uncertainties are now calculated directly in the newsips reduction . for details of our error analysis ,",
    "the reader is referred to gc .",
    "previous studies suffered from systematic temperature and luminosity mismatches between the unreddened / reddened star pairs .",
    "these mismatches were evident in the imperfect line cancellations seen in the extinction curves , especially the fe  iii blend near 5.1  @xmath18 .",
    "this study minimizes mismatches by using a larger sample of comparison stars than was available to previous studies .",
    "comparison stars for each reddened star were selected to satisfy the three fitzpatrick criteria ( f85 ) ; in addition , we required @xmath19 between the reddened and comparison stars to minimize the uncertainties in the extinction curve .",
    "the first criterion requires that @xmath20 be appropriate to dust reddening .",
    "the average value of @xmath20 for the lmc is @xmath21 ( f85 ) .",
    "stars with @xmath22 were selected .",
    "the second criterion requires that the difference in intrinsic @xmath23 magnitudes between the comparison and reddened stars be `` small '' ( @xmath24 ) . the @xmath23 magnitudes of our program stars were dereddened assuming @xmath25 .",
    "as all lmc stars are at roughly the same distance , this criterion amounts to assuring comparable absolute magnitudes between the comparison and reddened stars thus minimizing luminosity mismatches .",
    "the third criterion requires that the comparison and reddened star uv spectra be well  matched .",
    "this minimizes residual features in the extinction curve not due to extinction .",
    "this procedure resulted in 310 potential comparison stars for each reddened star .",
    "each potential comparison star was used to compute an extinction curve . the reddened / comparison star pair which resulted in a curve with the smallest line residuals",
    "was adopted .",
    "five stars from the f85 sample had @xmath26 and were discarded , leaving a total of 19 reddened stars in our study .",
    "these included three 30 dor stars ( sk @xmath868 126 , @xmath869 199 and @xmath869 282 ) and two non30 dor stars ( sk @xmath868 107 and @xmath871 52 ) .",
    "in addition , five stars have been added , three to the 30 dor sample ( sk @xmath869 206 , @xmath869 210 and @xmath869 279 ) and two to the non30 dor sample ( sk @xmath866 88 and @xmath868 23 ) .",
    "we have indicated the positions of all of our stars on an h@xmath27 map of the lmc in figure  [ fig_ha_map ] .",
    "a key to the numbering of the stellar positions in figure  [ fig_ha_map ] is given in table 2 .",
    "the final extinction curves computed for each pair are shown in figure  [ fig_ext_curves ] and the star pairs are listed in table 2 .",
    "the extinction curves have been fit using the fitzpatrick & massa ( 1990 , hereafter fm ) parameterization .",
    "the fm fit is a six parameter fit including a linear background , a drude profile representing the 2175   bump , and a far  uv curvature term .",
    "we emphasize that this parameterization is empirical and the individual functions describing the extinction curve probably have limited physical significance ( mathis & cardelli 1992 ) .",
    "the fm fits to individual extinction curves are plotted in figure  [ fig_ext_curves ] and the best fit parameters for each curve are given in table 3 ; the functional form of the parameterization is given as a footnote to table 3 . in determining the uncertainties on the individual fit parameters we have considered the effects of two sources of uncertainty , photometric and spectral mismatch .",
    "the photometric uncertainties include those in the broad band optical photometry as well as those in the iue fluxes ( for a detailed discussion of these uncertainties , see gc ) .",
    "we estimate their effect on the fm parameters by shifting the extinction curves upward by @xmath28 and downward by @xmath28 point  by  point .",
    "fm fits were made to both of the shifted extinction curves and the error in each individual parameter is taken as one  half the absolute value of the difference in the fit parameters between the two curves .",
    "the photometric uncertainties contribute most significantly to errors in the fm parameters @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ; they have little effect on the bump parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the effects of mismatch errors on the fm parameters were taken from cardelli et .",
    "1992 ) . by varying the spectral type of the comparison star and fitting the resulting extinction curve",
    ", they were able to estimate the uncertainties introduced in the fm fit parameters ( table 6 of cardelli et .",
    "al . 1992 ) .",
    "we adopt the quadrature sum of the these two sources of uncertainty as our estimate of the uncertainties in the individual fm fit parameters ( table 3 ) . for weak features ( ie .",

    "there is no correlation between these parameters in the lmc extinction data .",
    "the physical significance of @xmath30 is unclear ; the far uv extinction is a combination of the linear term and the @xmath30 polynomial term and the separation is mathematical rather than physical ( ccm ) .",
    "however , such a correlation may arise if @xmath30 and @xmath32 are due to different grain populations provided that the different populations respond to environmental factors in a similar way ( fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion of ccm that the processes producing changes in extinction must be efficient over a range of particle sizes and compositions . in this case",
    ", the absence of correlation in the lmc would suggest that environmental processes are affecting the different grain populations differently .",
    "the fm parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath30 depend on @xmath36 and so interpreting relations among them in the absence of @xmath36 information is difficult .",
    "ccm found that the general shapes of the uv extinction curves in the galaxy , expressed as @xmath54 , are well represented by a one parameter family of curves characterized by the value of @xmath36 .",
    "it is of interest to determine whether the uv extinction in the lmc follows the relation of ccm and whether the deviations from ccm in the lmc can be related to deviations seen in the galaxy we will discuss the fm bump parameters ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) separately in  3.2.2 .      there is an average galactic extinction relation , @xmath54 , over the wavelength range 0.125 @xmath55 to 3.5 @xmath55 , which is applicable to a wide range of interstellar dust environments , including lines of sight through diffuse dust , dark cloud dust , as well as that associated with star formation ( ccm ; cardelli & clayton 1991 ; mathis & cardelli 1992 ) .",
    "the existence of this relation , valid over a large wavelength interval , suggests that the environmental processes which modify the grains are efficient and affect all grains .",

    "sk @xmath867 2 and @xmath869 213 have stronger fuv extinctions than their respective ccm curves while sk @xmath866 19 appears too weak in the bump . only sk @xmath869 108 clearly follows the ccm relationship . in figures  [ fig_bs_rv ] and [ fig_a1300_rv ] we plot bump strength and @xmath57 versus @xmath58 for ten stars with measured @xmath36 s ; sk @xmath869 256 is excluded due to its very uncertain @xmath36 value .",
    "figure  [ fig_bs_rv ] shows that bump strength is consistent with ccm for the lmc ",

    "very little can be said about the relationship with @xmath36 in the far uv as seen in figure  [ fig_a1300_rv ] .",
    "the uncertainties are quite large and though both the lmc 2 and lmc  general sample appear to be consistent with ccm in the uv , they are also consistent with no @xmath36 dependence",
    ". more accurate values of @xmath36 along more sightlines must be obtained before it can be determined whether a ccm  like relationship may hold in the lmc . according to ccm , @xmath53 and",
    "therefore @xmath59 are proportional to @xmath36 ( mathis & cardelli 1992 ) . however , since @xmath53(lmc ",
    "general)/@xmath53(lmc 2 ) = 2.25 , that would imply that the average value of @xmath36 should be more than twice as large in the lmc  general sample if a ccm  like relationship exists .",
    "there is no indication from the available data that this is true .",
    "in fact , the sightlines in both samples appear to have low values of @xmath36 relative to the galaxy ( table 4 ) .",
    "this may indicate that dust grains in the lmc may be systematically smaller than in the galaxy .",
    "although the general shape of the uv extinction in the galaxy is well represented by the @xmath36 parameterization of ccm , significant deviations are seen , both in the far uv and the bump ( cardelli & clayton 1991 ; mathis & cardelli 1992 ; fitzpatrick 1998 ) .",
    "there are well known galactic sightlines which deviate from ccm in much the same way that the lmc 2 sample does .",

    "the unusual extinction curve characteristics along these lines of sight have been attributed to their dust environments which are quite diverse .",
    "the dust toward hd 62542 has been swept up by bubbles blown by two nearby o stars and has been subject to shocks while the hd 29647 sightline passes through a very dense , quiescent environment ( cardelli & savage 1988 ) .",
    "hd 210121 lies behind a single cloud in the halo .",
    "there is no present activity near this cloud although it was ejected into the halo at some time in the past ( welty & fowler 1992 ; larson et .",
    "al . 1996 ) .",
    "these deviations from ccm in the galaxy indicate that something other than the size distribution of dust grains as measured by @xmath36 must be important in determining extinction properties along a given line of sight .",
    "evidently , the same is true in the lmc .",
    "even though all the lmc sightlines have similar , low values of @xmath36 , they exhibit a variety of extinction curves .",
    "while the physical significance of the linear and far uv functions in the fm parameterization is unclear , the drude profile fitting function for the 2175   absorption bump which is part of the fm parameterization does have some physical significance as the expression of the absorption cross section of a damped harmonic oscillator ( ccm ; fm ; mathis & cardelli 1992 ) .",
    "further , neither @xmath31 or @xmath32 depend on @xmath36 and so variations in these parameters are directly tied to variations in the grains responsible for the bump feature .",
    "there is no evidence for a systematic shift in the central position of the bump in either lmc sample .",
    "the weakness of the bump in the lmc  2 sample means that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not strongly constrained in that sample . in the lmc  general sample , there are no systematic redward shifts of the bump but three sightlines are significantly shifted to the blue .",

    "several possibilities have been suggested to account for this including mantling of the grains and hydrogenation ( cardelli & savage 1992 ; mathis 1994 ) .    as in the galaxy , there is real variation in the width of the bump between various lines of sight in the lmc ( table 3 ) .",
    "five lines of sight in our sample have bump widths which nominally fall below the narrowest galactic bump ( @xmath62 , fm ) . of these five sightlines",
    "two ( sk @xmath869 213 and sk @xmath869 280 ) are affected by spectral mismatches in the bump region .",
    "the true bump widths for these two sightlines are not well constrained by the fm fitting procedure .",
    "the remaining three narrow bump sightlines ( sk @xmath868 129 , sk @xmath869 206 , sk @xmath869 210 ) , all in the lmc  general sample , interestingly all fall in or near the dust lane on the northwest edge of 30 dor .",
    "the bumps are well defined and the narrowness of the bump is real .",
    "an expanded view of the sk @xmath869 210 profile can be seen figure  [ fig_drude210 ] . there is a strong relationship between environment and @xmath32 in the galaxy .",
    "the narrowest bumps are associated with bright nebulosity while wide bumps are associated with dark , dense clouds ( cardelli & clayton 1991 , mathis 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , it has been suggested that mantles form on the bump grains in dark clouds resulting in broad bumps . in bright nebulae",
    ", there are no mantles and narrower bumps result from the bare grains . in this scenario , mantles are able to form in dense clouds shielded from the interstellar radiation field while the mantles on grains near h  ii regions are removed by the stronger radiation field . however , the three small @xmath32 lines of sight in the lmc appear to be associated with a dense environment even though they are near the 30 dor star forming region .",
    "several stars in the lmc  general sample ( eg .",
    "sk @xmath866 19 and sk @xmath866 88 ) are associated with bright h  ii regions and yet have normal galactic bump widths . accepting the explanation for the narrow bumps based on the galactic data , we would expect to find narrow bumps in the lmc  2 sample .",
    "in contrast with this expectation , the data presented in table  3 indicates that the lmc  2 bump widths are comfortably within the average galactic range .",
    "it does nt appear that the trend in @xmath32 with environment seen the galaxy holds in the lmc .",
    "there are no exceptionally wide bumps in our sample save sk @xmath870 116 with @xmath63 ; however , the bump is extremely weak and @xmath32 is not strongly constrained .",
    "the weak bumps in the lmc  2 region are not unique .",
    "as discussed above , several galactic lines of sight also have extinction curves with very weak bumps ( hd 29647 , hd 62542 , hd 210121 )",
    ". however , the lmc  2 environment seems to have little in common with these galactic lines of sight which in turn seem to have little in common with each other .",
    "though the swept up , shocked environment near hd 62542 may be similar to the lmc  2 environment ( but on a vastly reduced scale ) , the other two galactic sightlines sample relatively quiescent environments .",
    "hd 210121 lies behind a single diffuse , translucent cloud about 150  pc from the galactic plane .",
    "the interstellar radiation field is weaker than in the general interstellar medium and shocks do not appear to be important ( welty & fowler 1992 ) .",
    "larson et .",
    "1996 ) suggest that the apparent preponderance of small grains along the hd 210121 line of sight is due to lack of grain growth through coagulation as a result of lack of time spent in a dense environment .",
    "it appears that very diverse environmental conditions result in rather similar bump profiles .",
    "it is not known whether the bump grains are being modified in a similar fashion in different environments or substantially different modifications of the bump grains can result in a similar uv extinction in the bump .",
    "evidently the relationship between the uv extinction , dust grain properties , and environment is a complicated one .",
    "similar variations in the form of the uv extinction can arise in a variety of environments .",
    "the environmental dependences seen in the galaxy do not seem to hold in the lmc .",
    "since large variations in uv extinction are seen within both the lmc and the galaxy , global parameters such as metallicity can not be directly responsible for the observed variations from galaxy to galaxy as has been suggested ( e.g. , clayton & martin 1985 ) . however , one effect of decreased metallicity in the lmc is that the typical molecular cloud is bigger but more diffuse than those in the galaxy ( pak et .",
    "al . 1998 ) . hence",
    ", dust grains in the lmc may not spend as much time in dense , shielded environments as grains in the galaxy .",
    "the lack of time in dense environments may contribute to the apparent small size of the lmc grains as indicated by the low values of @xmath36 measured in this study .",
    "in addition , the weak and narrow bump lines of sight in the lmc all lie near the 30 dor star forming region which has no analog in the galaxy .",
    "the dust along these sightlines has probably been affected by the proximity to the harsh environment of the copious star formation associated with 30 dor .",
    "however , it must be pointed out that the most extreme uv extinction curves , having virtually no bumps and a very steep far uv are found in the smc .",
    "the smc dust lies near regions of star formation but they are very modest compared to 30 dor .",
    "these smc sightlines have optical depths similar to those in lmc  2 ( gc ) . due to very low metallicity of of the smc , its molecular clouds are very diffuse ( pak et . al .",
    "one might expect that values of @xmath36 in the smc be even smaller than in the lmc ; the current observations , however , show no evidence for this ( gc ) .    even with the improved and expanded samples of extinction in the lmc and smc , the link between particular environments and dust characteristics is still unclear .",
    "the combination of the galactic and magellanic cloud data show that the extinction curve / environment links are not as simple as previously proposed .",
    "but the different times spent by grains in dense molecular environments may be a significant factor as suggested for the galactic star hd 210121 ( larson et .",
    "al . 1996 ) . the processing history of dust grains ( ie .",
    "coagulation and mantling in dense clouds environments and exposure to strong shocks and radiation field outside of clouds ) is probably quite different in these three galaxies owing to the different molecular cloud environments and the varying intensity of star formation .",
    "the interplay between at least these two factors likely plays an important role in determining the form the uv extinction .",
    "the fact that starburst galaxies appear to have smc  type dust regardless of metallicity ( calzetti et .",
    "al . 1994 ; gordon et .",
    "1997 ) implies that the star formation history of a galaxy plays an important role in determining the extinction properties .",
    "however , the complicated relationship between extinction properties in the uv and environment implied by the galactic and magellanic cloud data suggests that great care must be taken in assuming the form of the uv extinction in external galaxies .",
