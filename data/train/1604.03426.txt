    "due to fine time resolution and broad spectral coverage , terahertz time domain spectroscopy ( thz - tds ) has become a leading method in thz spectroscopy @xcite , imaging @xcite and nondestructive testing @xcite of dielectric structures .",
    "there is an extensive literature on improving the thz imaging capability . in general , a large body of literature is focused on improving the hardware as thz - tds power levels are usually at sub microwatt levels @xcite .",
    "this perspective can be extended to improving thz acquisition methodologies such as compressive @xcite and wide field acquisitions @xcite . on the signal processing side",
    "the mainstream research has been focused on improvement of signal to noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite .",
    "many of these snr improvement methods are developed for transmission mode spectroscopy and have appreciable alignment with infrared spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "however , when it comes to imaging , inspection , and content extraction of surfaces and layered structures , thz - tds can suffer significantly from phase distortions along the sample surface .",
    "these sweeping distortions in thz time domain imaging appear as dominant challenge for in depth imaging and content extraction in densely layered structures , irregular surfaces or any 2d geometry .",
    "unfortunately , these heavy distortions are directly induced by the nature of the sample and thz - tds measurement scheme , and can not be addressed by minor hardware improvement , conventional denoising or snr enhancement techniques .    in this paper",
    "we propose and demonstrate a mathematical framework that enables demodulation of the recorded signal from sweep distoritions induced by slight depth variations or the layered structure inter - reflections .",
    "we view the problem as a demodulation of the distortion profiles from the sample texture , based on the reflected wave measured at different instances of time .",
    "the problem of interest is modeled as a bilinear inverse problem ( bip ) , which can be addressed using a low - rank matrix recovery framework .",
    "we propose an alternating minimization scheme , where a prior structure is considered for each factor in the bip .",
    "more specifically , we assume the distortion profiles belong to a low dimensional subspace ( which can be extracted from the raw data ) and the layer structure is of binary nature .",
    "the model considered for the layer texture is in fact a shape - based approximation ( see @xcite for examples ) , a phase corresponding to the main texture and another phase representing the anomalies and inclusions . using the given priors for each factor in the bip",
    ", we alternatively solve the demodulation problem to exclude the undesired sweep distortions from the thz images .",
    "our mathematical presentation mainly relies on multidimensional calculus .",
    "we use bold characters to denote vectors and matrices . considering a matrix @xmath0 and the index sets @xmath1 , and @xmath2",
    ", we use @xmath3 to denote the matrix obtained by restricting the rows of @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , @xmath4 denotes the restriction of @xmath0 to the columns specified by @xmath2 , and @xmath5 is the submatrix with the rows and columns restricted to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : phys ] we overview the physics of the problem and discuss the main demodulation problem to be addressed . in section",
    "[ sec : meth ] we present the main algorithmic framework to address the demodulation problem using an alternating minimization scheme .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : exp ] the sensitivity and performance of the algorithm are assessed with synthetic data .",
    "we further experimentally demonstrate the blind demodulation of the data recorded from both single and multilayered structures and report the algorithm outcomes for experimental data .",
    "we conclude this section with some remarks and future directions of research .",
    "consider an electric field that is linearly polarized in the @xmath6-direction , propagating along the @xmath7-direction in the free space .",
    "the waveform is considered to be a finite duration thz pulse @xmath8 , for which the traveling field along every point @xmath9 is @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the wave speed .",
    "due to confocal nature of the measurement at each @xmath9 position , the problem of interest can be considered as extracting the contents of a dielectric slab placed perpendicular to the wave propagation axis , based on analyzing the reflected field @xmath12 ( figure [ fig1](a ) , ( b ) ) .    for a homogeneous layer of width @xmath13 , with reflection coefficient @xmath14 and refraction index @xmath15 ,",
    "the returned signal can be analytically expressed by convolving the pulse @xmath16 with a train of impulse functions with decaying coefficients .",
    "more specifically @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "each impulse term in ( [ eqp3 ] ) corresponds to a reflection .",
    "particularly , the first term corresponds to the reflection from the front surface of the slab , the second term ( @xmath20 ) corresponds to the back surface reflection and the remaining terms correspond to the returned waves after a number of inter - reflections within the slab .",
    "cccc    fig1a.pdf ( 26,-3 ) ( a )    &    fig1b.pdf ( 47,-3 ) ( b )     +    fig1d.pdf(45,-6 ) ( c )    &    fig1e.pdf(45,-6 ) ( d )    the response in ( [ eqp2 ] ) can still be reasonably accurate when the dielectric slab is homogeneous along the @xmath7-axis , i.e. , @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "it only requires plugging the point - wise values of @xmath14 and @xmath23 in the formulation .    in the case of perfect or close to perfect reflection , where @xmath24 , the first impulse term in ( [ eqp2 ] ) dominates all the other terms and the returned wave is a simple modulation of @xmath14 with the pulse waveform . when @xmath25 , the most dominant terms in @xmath26 correspond to the first and second impulses , and the remaining terms decay exponentially fast .",
    "specifically , in many practical scenarios where the pulse width is sufficiently small and the slab width @xmath13 is large , the first reflected waveforms does not overlap with the subsequent reflections . in this case , still a modulation of @xmath14 with the pulse waveform is observed in different time intervals .    for multilayer dielectric slabs , the impulse response can still be cast as an impulse train , however deriving closed - form expressions for the coefficients is a sophisticated task and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "when the reflection coefficients of the layers are small ( hence transmission is the leading phenomenon ) , the dominant terms associated with different layers remain reasonably distinct from one another . if the pulse width is sufficiently small , for each layer the corresponding dominant reflection is still proportional to the reflection coefficient of that layer .    in all the situations stated above , for a measurement location @xmath27 with a fixed @xmath7 component , and sampling time @xmath28 ,",
    "the reflected signal is @xmath29 , which is a constant multiple of @xmath30 . in other words",
    ", the reflected images should contain the same pattern as @xmath14",
    ". however , due to non - ideal configurations such as a tilted or uneven sample , the effective measurement points are @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a function of small magnitude .",
    "for instance , in the case of a tilted sample @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are small constants .",
    "technically , the demodulation problem of interest in this paper corresponds to extracting the sample structure @xmath30 , based on observing the reflected signal @xmath36 at a fixed @xmath7 coordinate and time samples @xmath37 .",
    "due to the non - ideal configurations stated above , the returned signal , sampled at a time @xmath38 , is in the form of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 depends on the pulse waveform , sampling time and @xmath32 .",
    "the additive term @xmath41 models the noise uncertainty and undesired electromagnetic interactions",
    ". we will refer to the @xmath40 factor as a sweep distortion profile , which is often a slowly varying function when the misconfiguration is small .",
    "specifically , inspired by the applications presented in this paper , we are interested in single or multilayer composite slabs of binary nature , where for each layer @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constant .",
    "an example of a composite slab which roughly follows such model is a card marked with deep ink ( see example in figure [ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "figures [ fig1](c ) , ( d ) show examples of the observed reflection from a binary slab ( letter `` m '' printed on a card ) at two different time instances .",
    "we are willing to make a binary characterization of the sample content by demodulating and excluding the multiplicative sweep distortion profiles affecting the desired image . in the sequel we will present an inversion scheme to characterize the slab contents based on such multiplicative observations .",
    "for a more concise formulation we use the more compact spatial notation @xmath45 . based on the discussions in the previous section ,",
    "our observation is in the form of @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents the @xmath48-th observed reflected image dependent on the planar coordinate @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the true dielectric texture profile common across all the layers , @xmath51 is the sweep distortion profile corrupting layer @xmath48 , @xmath52 models the noise and uncertainty and @xmath53 is the domain of imaging for @xmath49 . as a reasonable model , we consider a normal distribution for the noise , that is , @xmath54 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) random variables for @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    ".    the ultimate goal is recovering the image @xmath50 and the distortion profile @xmath51 based on the observation of @xmath47 .",
    "our strategy to address the problem is considering known subspace models for the signals @xmath51 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the @xmath48-th subspace dimension . in section",
    "[ sec : subspace ] we introduce an algorithm to construct a set of low dimensional subspaces @xmath60 from the set of observations @xmath61 .",
    "also , based on the structure of the problem , we may benefit from prior assumptions about @xmath50 as will be detailed in the sequel .",
    "consider discretizing the domain @xmath53 into a collection of pixels @xmath62 .",
    "based on the model in ( [ eq1 ] ) , a natural way of inverting the data for the image and sweep distortion profiles is through the following minimization : @xmath63 here @xmath64 denotes the hadamard ( pointwise ) product and the bold scripts are vectors of length @xmath65 , corresponding to the variables in ( [ eq1 ] ) . consider @xmath66 to be a matrix representation of the subspace @xmath67 and @xmath68 is a subspace in which the signal @xmath69 lives ( in the case of no such assumption , @xmath68 can be simply the identity matrix spanning the canonical basis ) . under this assumption , the minimization in ( [ eq2 ] ) can be cast as @xmath70 where the search for the unknown vectors is performed in the corresponding subspaces .",
    "suppose @xmath71^t$ ] and @xmath72 to be a suitable selection matrix ( subset of the rows of the identity matrix ) such that @xmath73 . for the point - wise product of the image and the sweep distortion profiles we have @xmath74 in other words considering @xmath75 to be the outer - product of the unknown vectors @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the noise - free observations correspond to the inner - products of @xmath78 with known matrices @xmath79 . basically ,",
    "if we define a linear operator @xmath80 the noise - free observations are linearly dependent on @xmath78 , while the original version of the problem in ( [ eq3 ] ) is nonlinear in terms of @xmath76 and @xmath77 . however , since the outer - product of two nonzero vectors is a rank - one matrix , an equivalent reformulation of ( [ eq3 ] ) is the minimization @xmath81 where @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 denotes the frobenius norm . despite the linear relationship between the unknown variable and the noise - free observations , the rank constraint in ( [ eq5.5 ] ) makes it a combinatorial problem . as a remedy ,",
    "a well - known approximation strategy is to use the nuclear norm of @xmath78 , denoted by @xmath84 , as a convex proxy to @xmath85 : @xmath86 it is an interesting fact that under certain conditions on @xmath87 ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , the approximate solution of ( [ eq5.6 ] ) can coincide with the solution of ( [ eq5.5 ] ) .",
    "once a rank - one solution @xmath88 is available , the factors @xmath77 and @xmath76 can be determined up to a constant multiple ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) .",
    "other than the relaxation technique , there are other methods reported in the literature to address instances of ( [ eq5.5 ] ) .",
    "we are specifically interested in alternating minimization approach @xcite , since it allows incorporating prior information into the reconstruction of each bilinear factor .",
    "in minimizing the non - convex program ( [ eq2 ] ) a reliable technique would be to setup an alternating minimization scheme .",
    "basically , by fixing any of the operands in the bilinear term in ( [ eq2 ] ) ( either @xmath14 or @xmath91 ) the problem turns into a standard least squares problem . the process would be to initialize one of the operands in the bilinear model , say @xmath14 ; with this quantity fixed , the resulting least squares in terms of @xmath91 is solved . by plugging in the acquired solutions for @xmath91 s",
    ", we can solve another least squares problem in terms of @xmath14 , and proceed with such alternation until convergence .",
    "this alternation approach is capable of approximating the solution to ( [ eq5.5 ] ) .",
    "again under certain incoherence conditions on @xmath87 ( slightly stricter than the ones stated for nuclear norm minimization @xcite ) , the approximate solution coincides with the solution of ( [ eq5.5 ] ) .",
    "the major advantage of using an alternation scheme over the nuclear norm surrogate is the possibility of incorporating prior information beyond the subspace constraint on each factors of the problem in ( [ eq1 ] ) ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "basically , the proposed scheme corresponds to an alternation between the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimates of @xmath14 and @xmath91 .",
    "when some level of prior knowledge about the @xmath14 and/or @xmath91 exists , the framework could be generalized to an alternation between the maximum a posteriori ( map ) estimates of @xmath14 and @xmath91 , as will be detailed in the sequel .",
    "consider @xmath92 to be the joint probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath14 and @xmath91 s given the measurements @xmath93 .",
    "the map estimates of @xmath14 and @xmath91 correspond to the maximizing parameters of the posterior distribution : @xmath94 as a natural generalization , the alternating map estimation corresponds to the process sketched in algorithm [ alg:1 ] .",
    "@xmath95 , initialize @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99    in the sequel we elaborate on how to implement the proposed scheme using certain facts about the problem .",
    "we would like to note that we make some reasonable assumptions and provide some slight modifications in implementing the steps outlined in algorithm [ alg:1 ] .",
    "in this section we mainly focus on addressing the first stage of algorithm [ alg:1 ] ( line 3 ) , which is determining the distortion profiles @xmath91 based on the observations @xmath100 and the knowledge of @xmath14 .    to address this problem we only assume that based on the physics of the problem , the signals @xmath91 reside in a low dimensional subspace . in other words , @xmath101 for the discrete representation .",
    "we however make no prior assumptions about the coefficient vector @xmath102 . since @xmath103 , we simply consider solving the least squares problems of the form @xmath104 the solution to ( [ eq8 ] ) is @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the pseudoinverse of @xmath0 . in a sense , by making no assumptions about @xmath102 , instead of performing a map estimation ( as outlined in algorithm [ alg:1 ] ) , for a given @xmath107 we are performing an ml estimation of the sweep distortion profiles by solving the least squares problems ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "the choice of the subspace plays a key role for this problem . in the remainder of this subsection we present a one - time process which generates embedding subspaces @xmath108 based on the observations @xmath109 .    from a technical standpoint , @xmath110 ,",
    "where as stated earlier , @xmath91 is a rather smooth function and for our application @xmath50 is a function of almost binary nature .",
    "therefore , if we have a multi - scale representation of @xmath93 , there should be a good overlap between @xmath91 and the course - level approximation of @xmath93 .",
    "the high frequency components of @xmath93 should be mainly in hold of @xmath14 and the noise .",
    "based on this argument , consider a wavelet representation of the signal @xmath93 as @xmath111 where @xmath112 are the scaling functions , @xmath113 are the wavelet basis and @xmath114 is a fixed scaling level @xcite . for a fixed subspace order @xmath59",
    ", our proposed subspace selection for @xmath91 corresponds to the top @xmath59 scaling / wavelet basis functions with the largest coefficients ( in magnitude ) . in other words ,",
    "we sort the wavelet coefficients in descending magnitude order and select the basis functions associated with the top @xmath59 coefficients .",
    "the selected basis ( in discrete form ) correspond to the columns of @xmath108 .",
    "this process is performed only once during the entire reconstruction and once the subspaces are determined , they remain fixed throughout the alternation scheme .",
    "inspired by the second stage proposed in algorithm [ alg:1 ] , the main objective in this section is finding the map estimate for @xmath50 . in order to maintain a more compact formulation and closed - form expressions we make some independence assumptions about the pixel values as will be detailed in the sequel .",
    "based on the binary model considered , we assume that each pixel in the image @xmath14 belongs to one of the two classes 0 or 1 , and denote the pixel class by @xmath115 . following the categorization in ( [ eqcat ] ) , the pixel values in class 0 concentrate around @xmath43 and the pixel values associated with class 1 concentrate around @xmath44 . consider @xmath116^t$ ] and @xmath117^t$ ] to be vectors containing the pixel values and the class labels for the discrete image .    for our estimation problem , we are willing to address the maximization problem @xmath118 where @xmath119 in other words , given the observation @xmath109 and the distortion profiles @xmath120 , we are willing to acquire map estimates of the image profile value at each pixel along with the binary class that pixel belongs to",
    ".    generally speaking , for arbitrary random variables @xmath14 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( discrete ) , using the bayes rule we have @xmath124 where we used @xmath125 to derive the second equality .",
    "based on this result we have @xmath126 where for the sake of convenience , in all the expressions we dropped the prior knowledge of @xmath127 .",
    "basically , in ( [ eq10 ] ) , the vectors @xmath128 are known and deterministic and our intention to derive ( [ eq11 ] ) is to make the map estimation in terms of probability density functions which all make such prior assumption .",
    "also since the denominator term in ( [ eq11 ] ) is independent of @xmath14 and @xmath123 , in ( [ eqgmap ] ) we neglected the corresponding term as it will be a constant factor in the maximization .    to further proceed with simplifying the map objective , we assume that the pixel values in @xmath69 are independent of each other . based on this assumption and the i.i.d nature of the noise we can state that @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the @xmath131-th element of @xmath109 .",
    "the point - wise distributions appeared in ( [ eqpoint ] ) can now be modeled based on the problem setup .",
    "clearly , based on ( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath132 , which is an immediate result of the normal noise model .",
    "we also assume that @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are somehow the prior estimates of the portion of pixels belonging to each class ( e.g. , knowing that roughly 20% of the image pixels correspond to the anomaly ) .",
    "if no such information is available a priori , a reasonable assumption is @xmath136 .    finally , with reference to the term @xmath137 , knowing that a pixel belongs to class 0 ( or 1 ) we know that its value is likely to be close to @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) . in practice @xmath137",
    "should model the uncertainty on how the values of each class concentrate around the mean class value . while we can use different distributions to model such concentration , for simplicity and in order to obtain closed form expressions",
    ", we assume that @xmath138 and @xmath139 are in the form of _ truncated normal distributions _ , taking positive arguments and mainly concentrating around @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . by definition ,",
    "a random variable @xmath14 truncated to values greater than zero takes the following pdf : @xmath140 here , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are roughly the mean and variance and @xmath143 is a normalizing factor to assure the pdf integrates to 1 . to model an almost binary nature of the pixel values , we assume @xmath144 and @xmath145 , or more concisely @xmath146 figure [ fig2 ] shows the underlying truncated distributions .",
    "the positivity assumption in ( [ tnd ] ) is imposed by the physics of the problem , where the reflection coefficient of the slab is always considered to be a positive quantity .     and @xmath147 as truncated normal distributions , height=163 ]    having the constituting terms modeled in ( [ eqpoint ] )",
    ", we can proceed with the pixel value and class label map estimation . to maximize @xmath148",
    "we may minimize the negative log function @xmath149 based on the proposed distribution models , one can easily verify that @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 is a constant in terms of @xmath153 , @xmath154 and the constant factor in ( [ eqgmap ] ) .",
    "the minimization objective @xmath155 is separable in terms of the cost for each pixel and we can minimize each term individually . also minimizing @xmath156 can be performed in a serial manner by first minimizing with respect to @xmath157 and then with respect to the class label @xmath158 .",
    "more concretely , @xmath159 for a fixed given label @xmath160 , we can minimize @xmath161 with respect to @xmath157 by setting @xmath162 to zero . based on the formulation in ( [ gci ] ) a simple calculation yields @xmath163 the function @xmath161 is convex in terms of @xmath157 , and",
    "the solution to the constrained problem ( @xmath164 ) is the expression in ( [ eqsol ] ) if feasible , or 0 otherwise .",
    "basically , @xmath165 we are now only left with minimizing @xmath166 with respect to @xmath158 . since the class labels @xmath158 only takes binary values , we can conveniently find the corresponding minimizer through the following binary comparison : @xmath167 equation ( [ eqsol ] ) in some sense generates the optimal solution @xmath157 , but leaves us with an ambiguity about the class label .",
    "the label can be obtained based on the above comparison , to find the ultimate map estimator for the image profile .",

    "the simulation results mainly highlight the performance of the method for various number of frames and noise levels in the data .",
    "the second set of experiments demonstrate the method s success in removing multiplicative sweep distortion profiles from actual thz measurements .",

    "shows three sample images , where an almost vertically moving sweep distortion across the frames is observable .",
    "the samples are synthetically corrupted with white noise ( @xmath200 @xmath201 ) .    in recovering the binary profile , for the subspace construction step associated with this example",
    "we use @xmath202 most dominant wavelet basis . consistently through this example and the remaining experiments we use the symlet wavelet family .",
    "figure [ fig3](c.1 ) reports the reconstructed reflection profile @xmath14 , using our proposed scheme .",
    "the algorithm converges in less than 20 iterations , and as may be observed , the result is no more in hold of the distortion traces . a simple rounding of the result to the closest binary value ( between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) yields figure [ fig3](c.2 ) , which is reasonably close to the original profile depicted in figure [ fig3](a ) .",
    "figure [ fig3](d.1 ) reports the reconstruction using the nuclear norm framework proposed in section [ lowrank ] . while some level of distinction between the two binary phases is achieved , the fact that our proposed scheme efficiently uses the binary prior helps us outperform the nuclear norm reconstruction . a similar binary approximation of the nuclear norm reconstruction is demonstrated in figure [ fig3](d.2 ) , which clearly fails to characterize some of the main details in the original binary profile .",
    "to more extensively analyze the performance of our algorithm , we proceed by the sensitivity analysis of the main parameters affecting the reconstruction .",
    "for this purpose , two main scenarios are considered .",
    "first , an ideal case where the exact sweep distortion subspace is known a priori . from a theoretical standpoint , one way to characterize a subspace for the sweep distortion profiles is to run exactly the same experiment with a homogeneous slab and take the observations as the subspace basis .",
    "while experimentally such accurate characterization of the subspace is hard , here we present it as a hypothetical case for comparison purposes and to compare the results against an ideal setup .",
    "for the second class of experiments , we use the proposed wavelet thresholding framework to determine the distortion subspaces . for each proposed scenario",
    "we test the algorithm for various values of @xmath203 ( number of available frames ) and the snr in the observations .",
    "both the reconstructed @xmath14 as well as a binary rounded version are compared with the reference image depicted in figure [ fig3](a ) and the mean squared error ( mse ) is reported .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the mse values for various number of available frames and a fixed snr value of 10 @xmath201 .",
    "the dark solid curve corresponds to the case of exact subspace characterization and the dashed curve standing close to it is the mse value for the reconstructed @xmath14 rounded to the closest binary value .",
    "we can see that for only 7 frames ( or more ) , a perfect or close to perfect recovery of the binary profile is possible . for fewer number of available frames ,",
    "the mse still remains at a controlled level .",
    ", for various scenarios : a total of 20 frames using uniform sampling in time is made available through the simulation .",
    "for each mse report @xmath203 frames are randomly selected from the 20 frames and passed to the algorithm .",
    "the process is performed multiple times for each @xmath203 and the average mse is reported , width=288,height=230 ]    the lighter solid line ( and the dashed line standing close to it ) report the mse values of similar experiments when the sweep distortion subspaces are characterized through the wavelet thresholding .",
    "we can see that aside from a slight performance gap , the mse values follow a similar reduction pattern as the ideal case .",
    "based on the reported mse values , the recovery is still close to the reference image .",
    "the slight performance gap between this case and the ideal case is the result of error in exact characterization of the sweep distortion subspaces .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the mse values for the case of fixed number of frames ( @xmath198 ) and varying observation noise . for this experiment , in the case of known distortion subspace ,",
    "a perfect recovery of the sweep distortion profile is possible for snr values approximately exceeding 10 @xmath201 ( by rounding to the closest binary value ) . in the case of characterizing the sweep distortion subspace through wavelet thresholding ,",
    "the mse values follow a similar trend as the case of knowing the distortion subspace a priori .",
    "the only difference is a slight performance gap which is again linked to the error in exact characterization of the sweep distortion subspaces .        to experimentally apply the demodulation process we used a standard thz - tds system in reflection geometry . in the first experiment ( figure [ fig6 ] ) we used a binary sample with metallic surface and a cross shaped pattern carved into a @xmath204 @xmath205 @xmath206 metal surface with 2 @xmath206 depth .",
    "as noted in figure [ fig6](a1 - 3 ) , the spatial sweep distortions are dominantly present in the time domain observations .",
    "for this experiment @xmath207 frames were available , three of which are shown here .",
    "figures [ fig6](b1 - 3 ) and [ fig6](c ) report the decoupled sweep distortions from the binary cross profile . we can observe a good characterization of the cross profile thanks to the large number of available frames and high snr observations . a more challenging experiment with less number of available frames and noisier data is presented next .                                  a more challenging experiment",
    "uses a three layer paper sample with letters m - i - t printed on each page from front to back respectively .",
    "the page dimensions are 15 @xmath208 @xmath206 and the thicknesses are @xmath209 @xmath187 , stacked flush next to each other ( @xmath210 @xmath187 gap ) similar to the structure of a book .",
    "figure [ fig7](a1 - 3 ) shows the reflected signal from the first layer at three different instances of time .",
    "figures [ fig7](b1 - 3 ) and [ fig7](c1 - 3 ) show reflection samples from the second and third layers respectively .",
    "the available number of frames corresponding to the first , second and third layer are @xmath211 25 , 6 , 8 , respectively .",
    "followed by the observations in each column of figure [ fig7 ] , the demodulation results are presented for the three letters at different pages of the sample , as the thz pulse travels deeper into the pages . the rows 4 - 6 in figure [ fig7 ] correspond to the sweep distortion profiles decoupled from the observed data .",
    "the last row corresponds to the recovered character profiles .    for this multilayer setup , after the first layer the snr drops and a larger number of inter - reflections is induced , thus the recovered letters `` i '' and `` t '' in panels ( b.7 ) and ( c.7 ) have more noise compared to the recovered letter `` m '' on the first page ( panel ( a.7 ) ) .",
    "the clean results from the first experiment ( figure [ fig6 ] ) on the metallic surface are anticipated due to high snr and perfectly flat surface of the polished steel , however for the paper the reflection is rather small ( < 0.15 ) , the distortion contrast is at the same level of the signal contrast itself , and the pages have slight depth variations across them .",
    "the results from the paper sample in figure [ fig7 ] indicate the true robustness of the decoupling technique for practical samples .",
    "it is worth noting that the major burden in characterizing the sample inhomogeneity profiles ( characters in this example ) is the varying signal level in the observed images .",
    "for instance , while the contrast between the character `` m '' and the background can be visually detected in figure [ fig7](a.3 ) , the pixel values drastically vary from one portion of the letter to the other . as a result",
    ", characterizing the letter based on the pixel values becomes an inconceivable task .",
    "however , once a binary profile is reconstructed through the proposed algorithm , other post - processing schemes can be employed to characterize the reconstructions , especially in the case of the more noisy reconstructions such as figure [ fig7](c.7 ) .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite , where advanced shape composition techniques are employed to accurately identify binary inclusions in noisy images .",
    "this class of techniques can accurately characterize the inclusion in an image like figure [ fig7](c.7 ) , even when the noise is higher , parts of the object are missing due to signal occlusions , and we have clutter or overlapping characters caused by the inter - reflections from neighboring layers .      the main outcome of this research is developing a general demodulation scheme to process the reflected signals , conveniently applicable to thz imaging . while a careful processing of the thz data can produce high resolution images",
    "thanks to its high frequency , dealing with phenomena such as inter - reflections , noise and modulated distortions is inevitable .",
    "we showed that reformulation of the problem as a bilinear inverse problem and making practical assumptions , such as the binary prior , can assist us with a successful inversion of thz measurements in thz - tds systems .    using basic statistical assumptions about the image and the observation",
    ", we were able to develop an iterative inversion scheme , which is computationally efficient , distributable and scalable to big data sets .",
    "in fact , the main computational load at every step of the algorithm is a least squares solve .",
    "the remaining computations are in the form of thresholding - type operations .    since in many applications such as water profilometry , extracting coded structures , extracting sub surface cracks , the main objective is a binary characterization of the inhomogeneity in the samples , we used a binary prior in our modeling . the algorithm can be naturally generalized to the case of polyadic prior , where more than two levels are considered for the image profile .",
    "basically , the proposed algorithm can be further modified or combined with post or pre - processing tools to handle a larger class of imaging applications .",
