    "the exceptionally close proximity of the type  iipec supernova sn  1987a in the large magellanic cloud has provided a unique opportunity to observe a core - collapse supernova with all the resources of modern observational astronomy and over a very long period of time .",
    "near - infrared ( near - ir ) spectroscopy has played a vital role in the determination of the physical conditions in the debris and the investigation of the element synthesis , providing a valuable complement to optical spectra . in particular , in the nebular phase ( when the lines are mostly optically thin ) the line profiles produced in the high velocity , homologous expansion have enabled us to examine the ejecta abundances and their _ spatial _ distribution . during the first few years , all the major southern observatories obtained near - ir spectra of sn  1987a .",
    "observations at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) covering the first 3  years post - explosion were described in meikle et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1993 ) ( hereinafter papers  i , ii ) .",
    "+ in this paper we describe spectra obtained at the aat for a further 8 epochs from 1990 november 2 ( day 1348 = 3.7  years ) to 1995 october 17 ( day 3158 = 8.6  years ) .",
    "epochs are with respect to the explosion date 1987 february 23 . our day",
    "1348 spectrum was the last observation of sn  1987a obtained with the near - ir spectrometer figs ( bailey et al .",
    "1988 . also see papers  i & ii ) .",
    "all the subsequent spectra were obtained with the more sensitive spectrograph , iris ( allen et al .",
    "1993 ) , which allowed the acquisition of high resolution near - ir spectra to a later phase than was achieved at any other observatory .",
    "preliminary reports of these data have been given in fassia ( 1999 ) and meikle ( 2001 ) .",
    "the only other post-3  year ir spectra reported are those of bautista et al .",
    "( 1995 ) which reached day  1445 , but at a lower resolution than those described here . in a future paper ( fassia et al . , in preparation )",
    "we shall present @xmath2-band spectra of sn  1987a taken with the mpe imaging spectrograph , 3d ( weitzel et al .",
    "1996 ) , at the aat on 1997 dec 16 ( day  3949 = 10.8  years ) and 1998 dec 1 ( day  4299 = 11.8  years ) .",
    "we also note that the earliest hubble space telescope ( hst ) nicmos spectrum of sn  1987a was taken on 1998 june 15 ( day  4130 = 11.3  years ) , but has not yet been published .",
    "the observations are summarised in table  1 .",
    "some of the data presented here were obtained in runs of several days . in the text and",
    "diagrams these runs will usually be identified by the epoch of the first day of each . for further details of the figs spectrometer , used to obtain the day  1348 spectrum , see bailey et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and papers  i & ii .",
    "the iris spectrograph was based on a @xmath3 pixel hgcdte array .",
    "all the iris observations were taken at f/36 , yielding a plate scale of 0.79 arcsec / pixel .",
    "spectra were acquired in the echelle mode for epochs 14692112  days and in the @xmath4-grism mode for the subsequent epochs . in the echelle mode ,",
    "4 orders of cross - dispersed spectra were provided , covering 0.91.5  @xmath5 m ( @xmath6  band ) and 1.42.4 @xmath5 m ( @xmath2  band ) .",
    "the slit was usually oriented at a p.a .",
    "of 90 deg .",
    "_ i.e. _ east - west .",
    "the slit length was 13 arcsec ( 16 pixels ) while in the dispersion direction , 2 pixels corresponded to a spectral resolution of about 375 ( @xmath7 ) ( equivalent to @xmath1800  km / s ) .",
    "however , the actual resolution was generally poorer than this ( see below ) . to enable sky - subtraction ,",
    "the telescope was nodded along the slit by 58  arcsec ( 610 pixels ) . to improve the flux measurement precision of both the ejecta and the bright ring , the slit width for the @xmath6 observations was set at 5.8  arcsec .",
    "similarly , the 1348  d figs spectrum was obtained with a 5.9  arcsec aperture .",
    "thus , the resolution of the ( point - source ) ejecta spectra was effectively determined by the seeing . for the csm spectra , the finite extent of the bright ring ( @xmath8  arcsec , plait et al .",
    "1995 ) would have produced a slightly lower resolution .",
    "the @xmath6 echelle resolutions listed in table  1 , column  4 , were obtained directly from the fwhm of the he  i 1.083  @xmath5 m line .",
    "they were typically 200400 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the resolution of the ejecta spectra was probably slightly higher .",
    "for the @xmath2 observations , we were unable to use the 5.8  arcsec slit since it produced severe degradation of the s / n .",
    "we therefore used a slit width of 1.4  arcsec in this band .",
    "the @xmath2 resolution was obtained from the fwhm of the he  i 2.058  @xmath5 m csm line .",
    "owing to the declining flux , after day  2112 , spectra were taken using the lower resolution @xmath4-grism mode .",
    "this covered 1.22.1  @xmath5 m in a single order .",
    "the slit was usually oriented at a p.a . of 135 deg . in order to maximise the spatial separation of the spectra of the supernova and stars 2 and 3 ( see below ) .",
    "the slit length was 24  arcsec ( 30  pixels ) , while in the dispersion direction a 1.6  arcsec ( 2 pixel ) wide slit was used , yielding a spectral resolution of 120 ( @xmath7 ) ( equivalent to @xmath12,500  km / s ) .",
    "the nod throw was 1015  arcsec .",
    "+ the day  1348 figs spectrum was reduced using figaro ( shortridge 1995 ) .",
    "final fluxing was by comparison with contemporary broad - band photometry obtained with the aat ir photometer irps ( _ cf .",
    "_ procedure described in paper  ii ) , using the a7 dwarf bs  2015 as the local standard .",
    "however , by this epoch , the narrow he  i 1.083  @xmath5 m line from the bright ring had an intensity of about 20% of the flux within the @xmath9-photometry wavelength window .",
    "moreover it lay right at the blue edge of the @xmath9-band filter , making it difficult to judge the effect of the bright ring on the @xmath9-magnitude .",
    "( the spatial coverage of irps included the ring ) .",
    "therefore , taking into account other uncertainties , we judge the uncertainty in the fluxing to be of order @xmath1025% . the wavelength scale was calibrated using the narrow he  i 1.083  @xmath5 m and pa@xmath11 lines , adopting a redshift of + 289  km / s ( crotts & heathcote 1991 ) . + the iris data were also reduced using figaro . after bias - subtraction and flat - field correction the image - pair obtained at the two nod positions",
    "were subtracted to remove sky line emission .",
    "for the echelle - mode data , different echelle orders were then traced and corrected for echelle distortion .",
    "the positive and negative spectra were extracted from the resulting frames using simple extraction .",
    "we extracted over 46 pixel rows ( 3.24.8  arcsec ) , depending on the seeing .",
    "this is discussed further below .",
    "cosmic rays and residual sky - lines were identified and removed by comparing repeat observations of spectra obtained at different times during the night .",
    "wavelength calibration was by means of argon and xenon arc lamps and the night - sky emission lines present in the supernova spectra .",
    "the wavelength uncertainty in the echelle spectra ranges from @xmath100.0014  @xmath5 m in the @xmath6-band spectra to @xmath100.0025  @xmath5 m in the @xmath2-band spectra .",
    "the wavelength uncertainty in the grism spectra is @xmath100.009  @xmath5 m . to correct for the atmospheric and instrumental transmission functions and to flux - calibrate the spectra",
    ", we used the g  dwarf spectrophotometric standard bs  1294 ( allen & cragg 1983 ) .",
    "the adopted magnitudes were j=+5.20 , h=+4.90 , k=+4.84 .",
    "( for the grism spectrum on day  3158 , we used the a4  giant hd 19904 , adopting h=+6.66 ) .",
    "the spectral orders of the echelle spectra were then merged to form single spectra .",
    "the final fluxing of the spectra is now described .",
    "+ accurate flux calibration of the spectra was difficult and became increasingly so with time .",
    "this was due to the combined effects of the declining sn flux , variable seeing , variable atmospheric transmission for both supernova and standard ( the airmass was inevitably quite high _ viz . _",
    "1.41.8 ) , pointing errors of up to @xmath12  arcsec and , for the echelle spectra , the small number of detector pixels ( 16 ) along the slit in a given order .",
    "flux measurement under poor seeing conditions was a particular problem for the narrow slit spectra due to the greater ( but uncertain ) vignetting effects .",
    "however , the most difficult problem of all in the flux calibration procedure was contamination by light from the nearby star  3 , and even from the slightly more distant star  2 . to make matters worse ,",
    "star  3 is a variable be star . around day  1500",
    "the ir fluxes from stars 2 and 3 were about @xmath121.4 and @xmath120.85 , respectively , of the sn flux , rising to about @xmath124 and @xmath121.5 by day  2112 ( walborn et al .",
    "1993 , suntzeff private communication . see also turner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ) .",
    "star  2 lies at 2.9  arcsec from the sn , at pa = @xmath13 while star  3 lies at 1.6  arcsec distance at pa = @xmath14 ( walker & suntzeff 1990 ) .",
    "thus , for the typical e - w slit orientation used for echelle spectra , the distances of stars  2 and 3 from sn  1987a , along the slit , were only @xmath12.2 and @xmath11.5  arcsec respectively .",
    "( we note that even at our latest epoch , the intrinsic diameter of the ejecta source was probably less than 0.1  arcsec ( jakobsen et al . 1994 ) , and so was effectively a point source whose observed extent was entirely determined by the seeing . ) thus , under typical seeing conditions , the star  3 spectrum was spatially blended with the spectra of both the ejecta and bright ring of sn  1987a , while under poor seeing conditions even star  2 could significantly contaminate the sn light .",
    "the grism spectra of days  2952 and 3158 were taken with a slit pa of 135@xmath15 yielding slightly larger displacements of the stars along the slit .",
    "however , the much reduced flux from the supernova by these epochs meant that contamination of the sn light by the nearby stars was still a problem .",
    "the contamination from both stars took the form of a continuum of uncertain flux , together with possible narrow h and he emission lines from star  3 ( walborn et al . 1993 ) .",
    "+ assessment and removal of the contaminating light presented a difficult challenge . even with the wide slit",
    ", variations in the seeing conditions and/or telescope pointing precision could make the degree of contamination within the slit difficult to estimate .",
    "( a further complicating factor was that star  3 itself could vary by up to a magnitude over a period of 800 days .",
    "however , the ir light curves of the star provided by ( walborn et al .",
    "1993 ) meant that this variation could , in principle , be taken into account . ) as already described , we extracted the spectra from 46 pixel rows ( 3.24.8  arcsec ) .",
    "thus all the extracted spectra contained contamination from star  3 and sometimes star  2 .",
    "+ we first consider the removal of the continuum contamination from the ejecta spectra .",
    "we investigated several methods using ground - based observations .",
    "however , internal consistency in the results eluded us , probably due to uncertainties in the variable factors already described . therefore , we decided that the best solution was to make use of the high spatial resolution optical spectra provided by the hst . to determine the extent of the continuum contamination , we inspected the relatively uncontaminated optical hst spectra of the sn  1987a ejecta obtained on days 1862 , 2210 ( wang et al . 1996 ) and 2875 ( chugai et al .",
    "1997 ( c97 ) ) . the red end ( 60008000   ) of these",
    "spectra exhibits a weak , roughly flat continuum of @xmath16 erg sec@xmath17@xmath17 .",
    "c97 and dekool , li & mccray ( 1998 ) ( dklm98 ) suggest that this is actually a quasi - continuum produced by the down - conversion of uv photons following absorption / emission by metals .",
    "we therefore assumed that the ejecta continuum in the near - ir bands should also be roughly flat .",
    "however , in the reduced ir spectra ( before correction for stellar contamination ) , the continuum was observed to rise towards shorter wavelengths and so we attributed the rising portion to contamination from stars  2 & 3 . to remove the contamination , we first modelled the shape of the stellar continuum by fitting a blackbody of the appropriate temperature to the star  3 infrared photometry of walborn et al .",
    "since stars  2 & 3 are of a similar stellar type ( b2 ) the model continuum was used to represent the combined effects of contamination from both stars . however , star  3 was the dominant or even sole contaminator in all cases .",
    "we then scaled the model continuum and subtracted it from the reduced spectrum to try to produce a flat continuum .",
    "for most of the wavelength range covered , it was found that roughly flat continua could indeed be formed in this way .",
    "however , within the @xmath11.4  @xmath5m@xmath11.7  @xmath5 m range a relatively abrupt decline , or `` step '' in the continuum persisted .",
    "we believe this step to be due to a real physical decline in the quasi - continuum of the ejecta , and is not due to the fact that the @xmath6 , @xmath2 spectra were taken at different times and with different instrument settings .",
    "our reasons are , firstly , the @xmath6 spectra covered wavelengths up to 1.5  @xmath5 m and the beginning of the `` step '' is clearly present in these data alone .",
    "secondly , the step can be seen in the spectra taken at the aat ( paper  ii ) and at ctio ( elias et al .",
    "1991 ) at @xmath11000  days , and in the day  1445 spectrum of bautista et al .",
    "+ to finally flux - calibrate the de - contaminated spectra we proceeded as follows .",
    "first we edited out the narrow lines , producing observed `` pure - ejecta '' spectra , @xmath18 .",
    "for the low - resolution grism spectra , this could only be done very approximately . however , the csm line contribution to the flux in the wavelength region covered by the grism ( 1.22.1  @xmath5 m ) was probably small .",
    "this can be deduced by considering the csm line fluxes ( table  3 ) at earlier epochs ( days  14692112 ) when these lines were more clearly resolved .",
    "comparison with contemporary pure - ejecta @xmath19  band magnitudes obtained at ctio ( suntzeff private communication ) or with the empirical spectral model matches ( figs .",
    "35 ) ( see below ) indicates that the csm contribution was probably less than 20% of the total during this earlier phase , and showed little sign of increasing with time .",
    "we believe it is highly unlikely that a sudden rapid increase in the csm contribution occurred by day  @xmath13000 .",
    "+ we then scaled the individual @xmath19 regions of the spectra to match the contemporary ctio photometry . to find the scaling factors",
    ", we determined the true ejecta spectrum , @xmath20 , using the relation    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the ejecta magnitude provided by suntzeff , and @xmath23 is the filter transmission function .",
    "@xmath24 is the magnitude zero point given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the flux of vega derived from the kurucz stellar atmosphere models ( kurucz 1993 ) using @xmath27 = 9,400  k and log @xmath28 = 3.9 . adopting 0.0 as the @xmath19 magnitude of vega ( elias et al .",
    "1982 ) , @xmath20 was determined for each band and epoch .",
    "the scaling factor , @xmath29 , was then obtained from @xmath30 .",
    "+ to check the flux calibration procedure described above , we carried out the following test . the day",
    "1734 @xmath6 spectra were acquired under photometric conditions with good seeing , in a wide ( 5.8  arcsec ) slit .",
    "therefore it was reasonable to assume that the whole of the sn  1987a light and an uncertain amount of the star  3 light were blended within the slit , and that the flux calibration via the spectrophotometric standard was reliable .",
    "we then edited out all the circumstellar lines from the reduced , standard - fluxed spectrum , yielding an unvignetted ejecta spectrum , but still blended an unknown ( vignetted ) fraction of the star  3 continuum .",
    "we then scaled and subtracted a blackbody representation of star  3 , with the scaling adjusted so that , when multiplied by the ctio filter function , the resulting sn  1987a ejecta spectrum matched the ctio photometry .",
    "we found that the flux of the ejecta spectrum produced in this way differed from that obtained by the `` flat - continuum '' procedure by less than 5% .",
    "we concluded that the `` flat - continuum '' procedure was reliable , and so we applied the method to all the spectra .",
    "the factors by which the continuum - flattened spectra had to be scaled to match the photometry ranged from @xmath120.3 to @xmath122.3 , indicating the severity of the effects discussed above . including uncertainties in the star  3 subtraction",
    ", we estimate the final absolute fluxing of the ejecta spectra to be accurate to better than @xmath1040% .",
    "the final spectra are shown in figures  17 .",
    "+ we now turn briefly to the final fluxing of the csm lines .",
    "we first consider the csm spectra obtained in the higher resolution echelle mode .",
    "while uncertainties in the continuum was not a problem here , it was important to consider the effect of the extent of the ring ( @xmath11.2  arcsec in the dispersion direction ) .",
    "the echelle @xmath6 spectra were obtained with a wide slit ( 5.8  arcsec ) .",
    "in addition , all spectra were extracted from a region of @xmath313.2 arcsec .",
    "it is likely , therefore , that any vignetting of the csm flux was small .",
    "possible narrow line contamination from the be star  3 was checked by inspection of unpublished nicmos observations of this star taken on day  4130 ( p. challis & p. garnavich , private communication ) .",
    "this showed that the contribution to the narrow he  i 1.083  @xmath5 m line was less than 12% .",
    "we concluded that narrow line contamination was negligible .",
    "thus , the errors in the @xmath6 csm line fluxes would be mostly of the same origin as those present in the post - flattened ejecta spectra ( _ e.g. _ variable extinction ) .",
    "consequently we corrected the @xmath6 csm line fluxes using the same scaling factors , @xmath29 , as for the ejecta spectra .",
    "we judge the precision in the final @xmath6 csm spectra to be better than @xmath1040% . owing to s / n problems ( see above ) , the echelle @xmath2 spectra were obtained with a narrow slit ( 1.4  arcsec ) .",
    "together with the effect of the typical 1.01.5  arcsec seeing , and pointing errors , this meant that quite significant vignetting of the csm light probably occurred in the @xmath2 observations .",
    "we judge that as much as half the csm light could have been `` lost '' in this way .",
    "thus , while we also applied the @xmath29 scaling factor to the @xmath2 csm spectra , the effects of vignetting means that the @xmath2 csm fluxes are very uncertain . for the last two epochs ( days  2952 and 3158 ) , not only was a narrow ( 1.6  arcsec ) slit used , but the low resolution of the grism produced strong blending of the csm and ejecta spectra .",
    "consequently , no attempt has been made to extract csm line fluxes for these last two epochs .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     [ log ]",
    "the spectra ( figs .",
    "17 ) comprise broad resolved emission lines from the ejecta and narrow unresolved emission lines from the circumstellar ring , superimposed on a continuum .",
    "the continuum is roughly flat within most wavelength bands , but fades over the range 1.41.7  @xmath5 m by a factor of @xmath110 on day  1533 , and @xmath124 on days  1734 , 1822 and 2122 .",
    "as already indicated , we attribute the continuum to a blend of weak lines produced by the down - conversion of uv photons following absorption / emission by metals .      while it was straightforward to identify and measure the strongest or most isolated lines ( e.g. the he  i 1.083  @xmath5 m csm line ) , most of the features comprised blends of lines from the ejecta and csm and/or from different species . therefore , in order to identify and measure the component lines , we proceeded as follows .",
    "preliminary ejecta line identification was performed by selecting plausible candidate species from the line identifications of paper  ii and from the theoretical predictions of dklm98 and kozma & fransson ( 1998a , b ) ( kf98a , b ) .",
    "likewise , we used the work of lundqvist & sonneborn ( 2001 ) to provide suggestions for the csm line identifications .",
    "then , in order to confirm the line identifications and to measure the intensities , widths and wavelength shifts , we matched an empirical spectral model to the data .",
    "in this model , the continuum was represented by applying a smoothed spline fit to regions of the observed spectra which were clear of discrete emission features .",
    "emission features were then superimposed on this continuum .",
    "these were selected using the aforementioned identification sources .",
    "their profiles were represented using gaussian profiles with the peak value as one of the free parameters .",
    "+ for the csm lines , we assumed that the lines were redshifted by + 289  km / s ( heathcote et al .",
    "1991 ) , and that their widths were defined by the prevailing spectral resolution .",
    "this resolution was measured from the strong he  i 1.083  @xmath5 m csm line for the @xmath6 spectra , and the he  i 2.058  @xmath5 m csm line for the @xmath2 spectra ( _ cf . _ section  2 ) . within the [ fe  ii ]",
    "multiplets ( see below ) , the relative line intensities were derived by assuming that the population distribution within the upper term was determined by the boltzmann distribution at 3000  k. while the csm temperature was probably somewhat higher than this , it would have a negligible effect on the distribution within the small energy range of a term .",
    "for the [ s  iii ] csm lines , direct measurement of the line intensities was judged to be more reliable than use of the model matches .",
    "+ the empirical model ejecta line intensities , wavelength positions and widths were all allowed to vary under certain constraints . for a particular species ( _ e.g. _ [ fe  ii ] )",
    ", individual linewidths and wavelength shifts were always set to be the same in velocity space .",
    "for the [ si  i ] and [ s  i ] multiplets ( see below ) , the components of each multiplet had the same upper level and so the intensity ratios of a given multiplet were found simply from the a - values and statistical weights alone .",
    "given the uncertainty in the excitation conditions , determination of some of the intensity ratios within the [ fe  i ] and [ fe  ii ] multiplets was less straightforward since some lines arose from different upper levels .",
    "in practice , to estimate the intensities of the other components we simply used the same multiplet ratios as for the csm , adopting t=3000  k. while this may have produced inappropriate relative intensities for some lines , it is likely that most of the weaker lines made only a minor contribution to the spectrum .",
    "we also note that for the most significant line ratio _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath32/@xmath33 , the components ( which are actually members of different multiplets ) arose from the same upper level , and so could be estimated from the a - values and statistical weights alone .",
    "matching was guided primarily by the absolute intensity of the dominant component in a given multiplet .",
    "for each observed spectrum , the spectral model was varied until a visually satisfactory match to the observed spectrum was achieved .",
    "+ the model matches for epochs 1469 to 2112 are shown in figures  25 . also shown ( dotted lines )",
    "are the individual lines that make up each blend .",
    "it can be seen that some of the spectral features comprise quite complicated blends of ejecta and csm lines .",
    "details of the line parameters for the ejecta and csm are given in tables  2 and 3 respectively . in table  2 ,",
    "column  3 gives the displacement ( in velocity space ) of the line peak with respect to the wavelength of the identified line in the sn  1987a rest frame ( redshift = + 289  km / s ) .",
    "column  4 gives the linewidths ( fwhm ) , again in terms of equivalent velocity .",
    "the precision in the absolute intensities of the well - matched lines approaches that of the spectral fluxing precision ( section  2 ) , with even higher accuracy for relative intensities within a single - band spectrum .",
    "however , in many cases the matching is more approximate with consequently poorer line intensity accuracy .",
    "this tends to be an increasing problem at later epochs . to assess the precision of a line intensity given in table  1 or 2 , the reader is advised to examine the quality of the model matches in the spectral plots ( figs .",

    "+ in general , the fraction of the radioactive decay energy that does not directly escape from the nebula is injected into the nebular material via coulomb interaction with the positrons and compton - scattered electrons .",
    "the energy of the resulting non - thermal high energy electrons then goes towards excitation , ionisation and heating of the nebula ( kf98a ) .",
    "three effects play important roles in the evolution of the temperature and ionisation at the very late times considered here .",
    "these are the ionisation / thermal `` freeze - out '' effect , adiabatic cooling , and the `` ir - catastrophe '' .",
    "the first two are important in the h / he envelope , while the third plays an important role in the metal - rich core .",
    "the ionisation freeze - out effect was suggested originally by clayton et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and by fransson & kozma ( 1993 ) .",
    "these authors pointed out that as the sn evolves , there will eventually come a time when the recombination timescale exceeds the radioactive or expansion timescale , so that the rate of change in the level of ionisation slows significantly .",
    "once this phase is reached , the bolometric luminosity exceeds that of the instantaneous radioactive decay deposition , since some of the luminosity results from recombination following ionisation at a significantly earlier epoch . in the model of kf98a ,",
    "b the ionisation freeze - out phase begins at 800900  days in most zones , but has a more pronounced effect on the luminosity in the h / he envelope .",
    "however , in their `` inner - envelope '' model , dklm98 find that the freeze - out does not occur until much later than this .",
    "instead , they identify a `` thermal freeze - out '' where the radiative cooling timescale exceeds that of the expansion timescale . in their model , this occurs before the ionisation freeze - out but , as with ionisation freeze - out , results in a luminosity exceeding that of the instantaneous radioactive decay deposition .",
    "there is general agreement that by day  1200 , the ejecta are predominantly neutral , but with a fraction of singly - ionised species resulting from the ionisation freeze - out and/or direct ionisation by non - thermal electrons . during 13502000  days",
    "the electron fraction is @xmath64 in the h - envelope , rising to 0.1 in the fe - he zone ( kf98a ) . at 3425  days , lundqvist et al .",
    "( 2001 ) calculate that the fraction of iron that is singly - ionised , is in the range 0.20.4 .",
    "the adiabatic cooling becomes significant when the radiative cooling timescale becomes longer than the expansion timescale . for pure adiabatic cooling , t@xmath65 .",
    "owing to their lower density and metallicity , adiabatic cooling is already dominant as early as @xmath1250  days in the h - envelope and @xmath1800  days in the he - envelope ( kf98a ) . for the h / he zones within the core , the higher densities mean that adiabatic cooling begins to dominate at 800 - 1000  days . while fine - structure line cooling ( _ cf .",
    "_ ir catastrophe below ) becomes the dominant radiative cooling mechanism in these zones , it never supersedes adiabatic cooling .",
    "nevertheless , fine - structure line cooling may be significant in these regions ( c97 ) .",
    "kf98a find that the h - envelope temperature lies in the range 400 - 1000  k on day  1350 , falling to a range of 150300  k by day 2000 .",
    "the temperatures of the h / he zones within the core fall from @xmath1900  k to @xmath1300  k over the same period . the day  2000 kf98a value compares well with the @xmath1300  k derived from the balmer continuum by wang et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for about the same time .",
    "the model of c97 yields @xmath1130  k for the h - envelope at 2875  days , compared with 350@xmath10100  k derived from the balmer continuum at that time .      once the nebular heating / cooling rate drops below a certain level , cooling via low - lying fine - structure transitions dramatically overtakes optical and near - ir transitions as the dominant radiative cooling mechanism .",
    "consequently the stabilising temperature falls abruptly from @xmath12000  k to a few @xmath66  k , and the bulk of the nebula s luminosity shifts to far - ir emission .",
    "this effect is known as the `` ir catastrophe '' , and was predicted by axelrod ( 1980 ) in his pioneering work on type  ia spectral models .",
    "fransson & chevalier ( 1989 ) predicted that it could also occur in core - collapse sne such as sn  1987a .",
    "the first direct evidence for this phenomenon occurring in sn  1987a was obtained through the detailed study of the evolution of the near - ir / optical [ fe  ii ] lines during the second year ( spyromilio & graham 1992 ) .",
    "+ in the dense , metal - rich zones , fine - structure radiative cooling dominates for a considerable time .",
    "[ fe  ii ]  26  @xmath5 m emission is particularly important .",
    "fine - structure cooling is most pronounced in the fe - rich zones ( kf98a ) , where it commences at @xmath1500  days at 2700  k. according to kf98a , by the beginning of our observations ( 1348  days ) the temperature in the fe - he zone had fallen to @xmath67  k , where it remained until 2000  days , after which adiabatic cooling became important .",
    "the ir catastrophe is also important for the intermediate mass element zones , where the temperature at 1350  days is 200400  k , falling to 100200  k by day  2000 ( kf98 ) .",
    "both fk98b and dklm98 find that , owing to the ir - catastrophe , [ fe  ii ] 0.72 , 1.26 , 1.53 , 1.64  @xmath5 m lines originating from the newly - synthesised iron in the core should have vanished by @xmath1600  days . however , detectable flux in these lines persists beyond this epoch . fk98b and dklm98 attribute this to thermally - excited emission from primordial iron in the h - he envelope where the temperature remains above @xmath12000  k until after day  1000 .",
    "however , as indicated above , by 1350  days , the temperature in the h - he zone is below 1000  k and so thermally excited emission from these lines should be undetectable .",
    "+      we can use the observed near - ir spectra to examine the physical scenario described above .",
    "the evolution of the intensities of the principal ejecta lines is illustrated in figure  8 .",
    "the intensity and evolution of the h - lines in the adiabatic cooling phase is calculated by dklm98 and kf98b up to 1200  days . for epochs @xmath68  years",
    ", non - thermal ionisation from the ground state by compton - scattered electrons dominates photoionisation from excited states ( c97 , kf98b ) .",
    "non - thermal excitations are also important at epochs beyond 1000  days ( kf98b ) .",
    "dklm98 find that by day  800 the line ratios should be case  b. fk98b reach a similar conclusion , but with the transition to case  b in the core being a little later , at about 1000  days , being complete by day  1200 .",
    "thus , during our era , the h - spectrum is predicted to consist of a mixture of a low - temperature case  b h - recombination spectrum together with a contribution from direct non - thermal excitation ( see kf98b for details ) .",
    "line light curves are given by dklm98 and kf98b for the near - ir lines pa@xmath69,@xmath11 , br@xmath69,@xmath11,@xmath42,@xmath70 .",
    "dklm98 find that , for the well - observed near - ir h - lines pa@xmath11 and br@xmath42 , their models makes satisfactory predictions to 1200  days .",
    "this is in spite of their non - inclusion of the envelope with its delayed recombination effects .",
    "the kf98b model light curve for br@xmath42 , which includes delayed recombination effects in the envelope , is also in good agreement with the observations .",
    "their model indicates that , by day  1200 , the h - envelope is responsible for @xmath170% of the br@xmath42 flux , and that this fraction is growing . both fransson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and dklm98 point out that derivation of total h - mass from the h - lines is difficult and subject to large uncertainties .",
    "fransson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and kf98b make use of the line profiles in order to find the most appropriate model ( and hence the mass of h ) .",
    "( in a sense , c97 also make use of the observed velocity distribution in determining the h - mass ) . + we examined the ejecta h - line fluxes to see if they yield the predicted low - temperature case  b ratios .",
    "these were first de - reddened assuming @xmath71 ( blanco et al .",
    "we find that the observed , de - reddened intensity ratio @xmath72 for days  1469 , 1734 , 1822 .",
    "martin ( 1988 ) predicts a value of @xmath10.5 for a temperature of 2001000  k. given the uncertainty in the relative line intensities , we judge that the observed ratios are consistent with the predicted values . the uncertainties in the model matching are too large to make a useful judgement about the ratio on epoch day  2112 .",
    "martin ( 1988 ) also predicts @xmath73=0.195 .",
    "this is in fair agreement with the observed , de - reddened ratio of 0.18 on day  1469 .",
    "apparently poorer agreement is obtained on subsequent days .",
    "however , this is probably again due to model matching uncertainties , especially in the @xmath74-window .",
    "we conclude that , at least up to @xmath11800  days , the observed h - spectra are consistent with the scenario of non - thermal ionisation / excitation within an environment dominated by adiabatic cooling .      as for hydrogen ,",
    "theoretical considerations indicate that post-1000 day he - lines evolve in an environment where the temperature is dominated by adiabatic cooling , and the lines are driven by ( a ) non - thermal direct excitation , and ( b ) recombination following non - thermal ionisation .",
    "dklm98 and kf98b point out that the 2.058  @xmath5 m line is uncontaminated by other ejecta species throughout the observations , and also find that it is optically thin in all regions after 700  days .",
    "moreover , after @xmath1700  days , the 2.058  @xmath5 m line intensity is relatively insensitive to assumptions made about the he  i 584    continuum destruction probability ( kf98b ) .",
    "these considerations lead dklm98 & kf98b to suggest that the post-600  day he  i 2.058  @xmath5 m line can provide the best measure of the total helium mass .",
    "however , consideration of our spectra leads us to a more pessimistic view of the usefulness of the 2.058  @xmath5 m line in this situation . by day  1533",
    ", it was quite faint . to make matters worse",
    "it is blended with comparably - strong csm flux in this line .",
    "moreover , he  i 2.058  @xmath5 m lies in a bad part of the atmospheric window .",
    "consequently there is large uncertainty in the he  i 2.058  @xmath5 m line flux .",
    "dklm98 show that their model 2.058  @xmath5 m light curve provides a good match to the observations up to 1100  days .",
    "the kf98b light curve match is somewhat poorer , with a flux overproduction of about 40% between days 800 & 1100 .",
    "the 2.058  @xmath5 m light curves of both dklm98 and kf98b stop at 1200  days , but suggest a gradual slowing down . for the later epochs described here , to within the uncertainties ,",
    "the observed fluxes fall on a plausible extrapolation of the dklm98 model light curve , but continues to fall below that of the ( extrapolated ) kf98b light curve .",
    "+ dklm98 & kf98b agree that the he  i 1.083  @xmath5 m line is more difficult to use for the determination of helium abundance .",
    "it is more temperature sensitive , and is optically thick for much longer than is the case for he  i 2.058  @xmath5 m .",
    "indeed , kf98b find the 1.083  @xmath5 m line to be optically thick in the he  i region even beyond 2000  days .",
    "however , high optical depth in the inner zones may not be too important since , after 1200  days , the 1.083  @xmath5 m emission from the h - zone is predicted to dominate ( and was already optically thin at 700 days ) .",
    "kf98b also point out that there may be contamination due to [ s  i ]  1.082  @xmath5 m .",
    "our empirical model matches also indicate that [ s  i ]  1.082  @xmath5 m emission may be present . however , this line is part of a multiplet , with another component lying at 1.13  @xmath5 m and having about 0.3 of the intensity .",
    "examination of this part of the spectrum ( in spite of it being in a bad part of the atmospheric window ) indicates that [ s  i ]  1.082  @xmath5 m makes , at most , a relatively minor contribution to the 1.08  @xmath5 m ejecta emission ( see fig .",
    "we find that the observed fluxes of the he  i 1.083  @xmath5 m line fall on plausible extrapolations of both the dklm98 and kf98b model light curves .",
    "the low temperature ( t@xmath75400  k ) of the electron gas in the macroscopically - mixed core during the period of our observations implies that thermally - excited near - ir ejecta lines of [ si  i ] , [ s  i ] & [ fe  i ] should have faded below detectability .",
    "yet , the [ si  i ] and [ fe  i ] lines are quite clearly present during this very late phase .",
    "( strong blending makes the presence of the [ s  i ] lines more ambiguous . )",
    "in particular , the [ si  i ] 1.645  @xmath5 m and [ fe  i ] 1.443  @xmath5 m lines are visible to beyond day  2000 . the persistence of these lines provides valuable support for the proposition that , by this era , these lines are produced either by recombination or through direct excitation by non - thermal electrons .",
    "+ the [ si  i ]  1.6  @xmath5 m multiplet is of particular interest here .",
    "fhk96 point out that for this species , recombination to the neutral state does not produce any significant line emission in the optical or near - ir region .",
    "the [ si  i ]  1.6  @xmath5 m emission must be due entirely to direct excitation by non - thermal electrons . an interesting consequence of this is that the line luminosity will follow the instantaneous energy input , and will be independent of the ejecta temperature . at very late times",
    "this is dominated by the 100% absorption of @xmath0ti decay positrons .",
    "thus , if the @xmath0ti scenario is correct , the luminosity in these lines should converge to a near - constant value . in figure  8 we see that the [ si  i ] 1.645  @xmath5 m line fades by about a factor of 3 between days  1734/1822 and 2112 . during this period ,",
    "the radioactive energy deposition is dominated by @xmath0ti and would fade by a factor of about 1.5 .",
    "thus , to within the uncertainty in the line intensities , the evolution of [ si  i ] 1.645  @xmath5 m is consistent with the radioactive decay and energy deposition being dominated by @xmath0ti decay at these late times .",
    "we note that fhk96 also show that lines which are driven purely by non - thermal excitation , such as the [ si  i ]  1.6  @xmath5 m multiplet , have the potential to provide reliable , temperature - insensitive mass estimates , provided the line profile and the bolometric luminosity is also known .",
    "+ c97 suggest that , by day  2875 , virtually the entire positron luminosity of the @xmath0ti is deposited in the fe / si - rich clumps . while cooling is mostly by ground - term fine - structure lines , about 10% ( 10@xmath76",
    "erg / s ) is via the uv - optical - nir lines of neutral species .",
    "about 20% ( of the @xmath77 erg / s ) is emitted as identified uv lines of fe  i and si  i with a further @xmath170% being down - converted to numerous allowed and forbidden optical / nir metal lines , forming a quasi - continuum . of the remaining @xmath78 erg / s , a substantial fraction flows into the [ si  i ] 1.6  @xmath5 m and [ fe  i ] 1.44  @xmath5 m near - ir multiplets .",
    "this appears to be supported by our low - resolution spectra ( figure  6 ) taken on days  2952 and 3158 where the [ fe  i ] 1.443  @xmath5 m and possibly the [ si  i ] 1.645  @xmath5 m features are still detected .",
    "the luminosity in just the [ fe  i ] 1.443  @xmath5 m line on day  2952 is about @xmath79 erg / s .",
    "as with the neutral forbidden lines , the low temperature of the ejecta during the era considered here means that there would have been negligible thermal excitation of the [ fe  ii ]  1.26 , 1.64  @xmath5 m multiplets .",
    "this includes the excitation of primordial iron in the h - envelope since , as mentioned above , even there it is expected that the temperature would be less than 1000  k by day  1350 ( kf98a ) .",
    "this suggests , therefore , that the persistence of the [ fe  ii ] lines must be due to recombination or direct excitation by non - thermal electrons .",
    "however , we note that c97 state that near - ir [ fe  ii ] lines produced by radiative cascade are expected to be weak since the major radiative cascade to the ground level goes through optical forbidden lines and fir lines of the ground term .",
    "detailed modelling is required to test if this is in conflict with our detection of these lines .",
    "the fwhm velocities of the more prominent ejecta lines are listed in table  2 , col .",
    "the he  i lines apparently exhibit the largest width , at @xmath15000  km / s ( fwhm ) .",
    "however , the uncertainty in this measurement is large due to strong blending of the he  i ejecta lines with csm lines and/or other species .",
    "the h  i lines and the [ fe  i ] , [ fe  ii ] lines show widths of 40004500  km / s , while the [ si  i ] lines have widths closer to 3000  km / s .",
    "even this latter value is higher than the @xmath12000  km / s invoked for the macroscopically mixed core .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that the [ fe  i ] and [ fe  ii ] lines exhibit higher velocity widths than the [ si  i ] lines .",
    "we argued above that the persistence of the forbidden iron line emission during the era studied here must be driven by delayed recombination following freeze - out or through direct excitation by non - thermal electrons .",
    "consequently , the high velocities in these lines imply that these processes must be occurring well out into the h / he envelope .",
    "detailed modelling will be required to determine how much each process contributes to the line emission .",
    "if we favour the latter scenario , it immediately suggests that upward mixing was even greater than has been assumed hitherto .",
    "we note that velocities of at least @xmath13000  km / s were observed in the [ fe  ii ] lines as early as the end of year  1 ( paper  i and spyromilio et al .",
    "1990 , haas _",
    "et al . _ 1990 ) .",
    "moreover , fassia & meikle ( 1999 ) showed that the presence of the he  i 1.083  @xmath5 m line on days  76135 implied that upward mixing of @xmath56ni in the ejecta of sn  1987a had extended to velocities as high as 30004000  km / s .",
    "upward mixing of @xmath56ni to even higher velocities ( over 5000  km / s ) has been recently deduced by mitchell et al .",
    "( 2001 ) on the basis of the high strength of the balmer lines a few days after explosion .",
    "such high @xmath56ni velocities may be evidence of neutrino - instability - driven acceleration of radioactive nickel just after the core - bounce ( _ e.g. _ herant , benz & colgate 1992 ) . alternatively , these results may favour the jet - like explosion models of nagataki ( 2000 ) , in which the high velocity [ fe  ii ] line profiles are well reproduced . +",
    "another remarkable characteristic of these late - time spectra is the presence and persistence of blueshifts ( with respect to the supernova rest frame ) in the ejecta lines ( table  2 , col .",
    "3 ) , with values of typically 200  km / s to 800  km / s .",
    "such shifts first appeared around day  600 ( paper  ii ) and were attributed to the formation of dust , blocking out the red ( far - side ) wing of the line . with the persistence of the blueshifts to as late as day",
    "2000 we conclude that very dense dust concentrations must have formed in the ejecta .",
    "however it is possible that asymmetry in the excitation conditions may also be contributing to the effect .",
    "we have presented near - ir spectra of sn  1987a covering the period 3.7 and 8.6  years post - explosion .",
    "this is the first time that ir spectra of a supernova has been obtained to such late epochs .",
    "we have described the measures taken to remove contamination from the nearby stars 2 and 3 .",
    "the resulting spectra comprise emission from both the ejecta and the bright circumstellar ring .",
    "the contributions from these two sources were separated out using an empirical spectral model .",
    "the csm emission lines comprise recombination lines of h  i and he  i , and forbidden lines of [ s  iii ] and [ fe  ii ] .",
    "the allowed ejecta spectra include lines of h  i , he  i , na  i , [ si  i ] , [ fe  i ] , [ fe  ii ] and possibly [ s  i ] . we are unable to confirm the presence of weak [ co  i ] and [ co  ii ] lines as suggested by bautista et al .",
    "( 1995 ) on day  1445 . + the intensity ratios and widths of the h  i ejecta lines are consistent with the predicted low - temperature case  b recombination spectrum arising from non - thermal ionisation / excitation in an extended , adiabatically cooled h - envelope .",
    "owing to difficulties with low signal - to - noise and csm - ejecta blending , the he  i 2.058  @xmath5 m ejecta line is probably of less value than pure ejecta theory would suggest .",
    "+ perhaps the most interesting result is the slow decline in the ejecta forbidden lines .",
    "this is particularly important for the [ si  i ] lines , since it supports the scenario that pure non - thermal excitation was taking place , driven increasingly predominantly by the decay of @xmath0ti .",
    "the data presented here offers the prospect of improved abundance measurements of silicon in the ejecta . + the fwhm of the ejecta lines provide evidence that the extensive mixing has occurred , with heavy elements reaching layers with velocities as high as @xmath13000 - 4500  km / s .",
    "the iron velocities were particularly high , and may provide support for the neutrino - instability fast - nickel scenario , or for a jet - like explosion .",
    "the blueshifts of the ejecta lines that had appeared around day 600 ( paper ii ) continued to be present .",
    "this probably indicates that dense concentrations of dust persisted in the ejecta even as late as day  2000 .",
    "however , asymmetry in the excitation conditions may also contribute to the observed blueshifts .",
    "+ the spectra presented here are unique .",
    "it is likely to be many years before such late - time near - ir observations are obtained for another supernova .",
    "moreover , with the increasing interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar ring , these near - ir spectra are probably the last from the `` pristine ejecta '' of sn  1987a that can be obtained .",
    "we dedicate this paper to the memory of the late david allen .",
    "he played a central role in the near - ir study of sn  1987a .",
    "he made particularly vital contributions to the work described here , both as project scientist for iris , and by carrying out most of the observations .",
    "he is sorely missed .",
