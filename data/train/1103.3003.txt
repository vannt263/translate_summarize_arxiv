    "the cooperon - fermion model ( for a review , see ref . )",
    "is a basic model for superconductivity that has widely been adopted to explain the bcs - bec crossover in ultra - cold fermionic atomic gases @xcite and high-@xmath1 superconductivity.@xcite the resonantly paired fermions , or cooperons , in this model can either be locally bound pairs of small polarons due to extremely strong electron - phonon coupling,@xcite or localized cooper pairs due to strong local pairing as might be the case in high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite , or molecular bosons in ultra - cold atoms.@xcite the potential existence of finite energy cooperons with a local attraction has also been put forward a few years ago in a simple semiconductor system.@xcite one recent work based on the four - leg ladder hubbard model @xcite as well as earlier studies in the quasi-2d ladder hubbard model @xcite reveals the important role of the cooperon excitations in the transition from insulating state to superconducting state .    in cuprates ,",
    "the interplay between the finite energy cooperon excitations around the antinode and the truncated fermi surface around the node has recently been proposed as a possible mechanism for the superconductivity in a two - gap scenario.@xcite the dominant underlying mechanism for driving superconductivity in this model is the scattering two electrons involving a virtual cooperon @xmath2 .",
    "compared with the attractive hubbard model , the cooperon - fermion model has much richer physics since it has the complete dynamical information of the interaction between two fermions and the delocalization of cooperons with decreasing temperature .",
    "so far most work on this model is done at the mean field level , with either the t - matrix method or various other methods going beyond simple mean field theory by including more diagrams @xcite but there have been few unbiased calculations .",
    "a recent exact diagonalization study of this model has been limited by small sizes and special geometries .",
    "@xcite a direct quantum monte carlo simulation usually suffers from a sign problem,@xcite except for certain models and algorithms , such as determinant quantum monte carlo simulations of the attractive hubbard model .    in this paper",
    ", we simulate the two - dimensional cooperon - fermion model using a continuous - time diagrammatic determinant quantum monte carlo method ( ddqmc ) .",
    "the hamiltonian has the form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fermionic creation ( annihilation ) operator with spin @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator of a cooperon .",
    "the interaction term @xmath7 leads to the @xmath8-wave pairing of fermions mediated by the originally localized cooperons with a band gap @xmath9 and the delocalization of cooperons at low temperatures .",

    "it is a trivial generalization to include attractive interactions between the fermions .    by integrating out the bosonic degrees of freedom ,",
    "an effective action for the fermionic part can be obtained , which has a form similar to the attractive hubbard model but with full dynamic properties : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bare bosonic green s function .",
    "the attractive hubbard model can be obtained by approximating @xmath15 with @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the renormalized band gap of the cooperons ) including the dominant contribution from the renormalized @xmath18 cooperon .",
    "we develop a continuous - time ddqmc algorithm , similar to the algorithms for an attractive hubbard model@xcite for the cooperon - fermion model , and obtain the numerically exact solution to the model at the filling value @xmath19 .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition temperature is estimated from the finite - size scaling of the fermion pair correlation function and the cooperon green s function .",
    "the renormalization of the cooperon band characterized by the effective gap @xmath17 and the effective mass @xmath20 are examined carefully . applying these results to study",
    "the strong diamagnetism recently observed in cuprates , we find that the renormalization of the cooperon band will enhance the diamagnetism dramatically at low temperatures , which qualitatively agrees with the experimental data .",
    "continuous - time ddqmc algorithms have been applied successfully in the past to obtain the critical temperature in the bcs - bec crossover@xcite the sign problem in these algorithms is avoided by collecting all feynman diagrams with the same distribution of vertices as a single configuration which turns out to have a positive - definitive weight .",
    "this approach can also be applied to the cooperon - fermion model eliminating the severe sign problem coming from the permutations of the fermionic lines . in the interaction picture ,",
    "the partition function for the model ( [ eq : h ] ) can be expressed as @xmath21^{n }   \\\\    & \\cdot\\frac{1}{n ! } \\prod_{i=1,n } dr_{i } d\\tau_{i } \\mathcal{t}_{\\tau } ( -u   c^{\\dag}_{r_{i},\\tau_{i},\\uparrow}c^{\\dag}_{r_{i},\\tau_{i},\\downarrow}b_{r_{i},\\tau_{i } } + h.c.)\\bigr ] \\end{split } \\label{eq : z}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 in the hamiltonian of free fermions with the spin @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the hamiltonian for free cooperons , the bilinear in @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 terms respectively in eq .  .",
    "to describe the feynman diagrams , we define two different kinds of events , shown in fig .  [ fig : event](a ) , representing the process of combining two fermions with opposite spins into one cooperon and the reverse process . for a typical feynman diagram like the one shown in fig .",

    "the determinant of the matrix @xmath36 comes from the anti - commutation relation of fermions , while the permanent perm@xmath37 originates in the commutation relation between cooperons .",
    "in contrast to determinants , which can be efficiently evaluated , the calculation of a permanent is an exponentially hard problem .",
    "thus , we evaluate the permanent by individually sampling all permutations of the bosonic lines . a typical diagram @xmath38 encountered in the monte carlo sampling",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : event](c ) .",
    "the open ends of fermionic lines indicate that all possible connection ways of the fermion lines are summed up in the determinant , while the connection between the cooperon lines is fixed , indicating that the specific connections are sampled individually . summing the fermion lines into a determinant",

    "<S> we investigate the two - dimensional cooperon - fermion model in the correlated regime with a new continuous - time diagrammatic determinant quantum monte carlo ( ddqmc ) algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the transition temperature @xmath0 , examine the effectively reduced band gap and cooperon mass , and find that delocalization of the cooperons enhances the diamagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> when applied to diamagnetism of the pseudogap phase in high-@xmath0 cuprates , we obtain results in a qualitative agreement with recent torque magnetization measurements . </S>"
