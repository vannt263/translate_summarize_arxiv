    "when thinking about quadratic and homogeneous hamiltonian systems on the dual of a lie algebra , the first example that comes to our mind is the system describing the rotations of a free rigid body around its center of mass .",
    "this system was derived by euler in 1758 ( see e.g. @xcite ) then generalized by poincar ( see @xcite ) , and then again later by arnold ( see e.g. @xcite ) starting from the original @xmath3 lie algebra , to a general lie algebra .",
    "the mathematical literature contains a huge amount of writings concerning euler s equations , from their original form to the most general forms ( see e.g. @xcite ,",

    ".    in this paper we study a large class of hamiltonian systems defined on the dual of the lie algebra @xmath0 of real @xmath1 - skew - symmetric matrices , where @xmath1 is an arbitrary @xmath2 real symmetric matrix .",
    "more precisely , we consider the hamiltonian systems on @xmath4 , generated by quadratic hamiltonian functions , and we show that under suitable conditions , the classical `` relaxed '' free rigid body dynamics , represents the normal form of a hamiltonian system on @xmath4 , generated by a quadratic and homogeneous hamiltonian function , and respectively the classical `` relaxed '' free rigid body dynamics with three linear controls , represents the normal form of a hamiltonian system on @xmath4 , generated by a quadratic hamiltonian function . as a consequence of these results we get that the extended free rigid body introduced in @xcite is equivalent to the classical `` relaxed '' free rigid body .",
    "note that by classical `` relaxed '' free rigid body dynamics , we mean the dynamics generated by the classical euler s equations of the free rigid body on @xmath5 , where the hamiltonian is supposed to be generated by an arbitrary @xmath2 diagonal real matrix .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the second section we prepare the framework of our study , by introducing the family of hamiltonian systems to be analyzed , and recall some of the main geometrical properties of the poisson configuration manifold . in the third section of this article one",
    "compute explicitly the normal form of a general quadratic and homogeneous hamiltonian system on @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , one shows that if there exists @xmath7 such that the symmetric real matrix @xmath8 is positive definite , where @xmath9 denotes the symmetric matrix generating the quadratic and homogeneous hamiltonian function @xmath10 , then the hamiltonian system @xmath11 , is equivalent to the relaxed free rigid body dynamics . in the fourth section",
    ", one shows that the normal form of a general quadratic hamiltonian system on @xmath6 in the case when there exists @xmath7 such that the symmetric real matrix @xmath8 is positive definite , is equivalent to the relaxed free rigid body dynamics with three linear controls . in the last section ,",
    "one gives a unified and also generalized formulation of the results obtained in the previous sections , by analyzing the case of a general quadratic hamiltonian system on a natural extension of @xmath4 .    for details on poisson geometry and hamiltonian dynamics ,",
    "see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as the purpose of this paper is to study the quadratic hamiltonian systems on @xmath4 from the poisson geometry and dynamics point of view , the first step in this approach is to prepare the geometric framework of the problem .",
    "let us recall first some generalities about the lie algebra @xmath0 of @xmath12 real @xmath1-skew - symmetric matrices , and his dual space @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is an arbitrary @xmath12 real symmetric matrix . in the case when @xmath1 is nondegenerate ,",
    "the lie algebra @xmath13 is the lie algebra of the lie group @xmath14 of @xmath1-orthogonal @xmath12 matrices .",
    "let us now recall a lie algebra isomorphism between @xmath0 and @xmath15 . for details regarding this isomorphism , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite .

    "note that for @xmath1 nonsingular , the above isomorphism between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , can be defined by using the equation @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "an immediate consequence of the this proposition is that @xmath25 @xmath15 , viewed as a dual of a lie algebra , it has a natural poisson structure , namely the `` minus '' lie - poisson structure , which in this case proves to be generated by the poisson bracket : @xmath26 for any @xmath27 , where the smooth function @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 for more details regarding this bracket and the associated lie - poisson dynamics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to see that the center of the poisson algebra @xmath30 is generated by the casimir invariant @xmath28 , @xmath31 .",
    "hence , using the above isomorphism between @xmath4 and @xmath15 , a quadratic hamiltonian system on @xmath4 is isomorphically represented by a quadratic hamiltonian system on @xmath15 as follows : @xmath32 where the hamiltonian @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 , with @xmath35 a given symmetric matrix , and @xmath36 .",
