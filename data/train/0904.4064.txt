    "resultants provide efficient ways for studying and solving polynomial systems by means of their matrices .",
    "they are most efficiently expressed by a generically nonsingular matrix , whose determinant is a multiple of the resultant , so that the determinant degree with respect to the coefficients of one polynomial equals that of the resultant . for two univariate polynomials",
    "there are matrix formulae named after sylvester and bzout , whose determinant equals the resultant ; we refer to them as detererminantal formulae .",
    "unfortunately , such determinantal formulae do not generally exist for more variables , except for specific cases ; this is the topic of our paper .",
    "we consider the sparse ( or toric ) resultant , which exploits _ a priori _ knowledge on the support of the equations .",
    "matrix formulae have been studied for systems where the variables can be partitioned into groups so that every polynomial is homogeneous in each group , i.e.  _ mixed multihomogeneous _ , or multigraded , systems .",
    "this study is an intermediate stage from the theory of homogeneous and unmixed multihomogeneous systems , towards fully exploiting arbitrary sparse structure .",
    "multihomogeneous systems are encountered in several areas , e.g.@xcite .",
    "few foundational works exist , such as @xcite , where bigraded systems are analyzed .",
    "our work continues that of @xcite , where the unmixed case has been treated , and generalizes their results to systems whose newton polytopes are scaled copies of one polytope .",
    "these are known as generalized unmixed systems , and allow us to take a step towards systems with arbitrary supports .",
    "this is the first work that treats _ mixed _ multihomogeneous equations , and provides explicit resultant matrices .",
    "sparse resultant matrices are of different types . on the one end of the spectrum",
    "are the _ pure sylvester - type _ matrices , filled in by polynomial coefficients ; such are sylvester s and macaulay s matrices . on the other end",
    "are the _ pure bzout - type _ matrices , filled in by coefficients of the _ bezoutian _ polynomial .",
    "hybrid matrices contain blocks of both pure types .",
    "we examine weyman complexes ( defined below ) , which generalize the cayley - koszul complex and yield the multihomogeneous resultant as the determinant of a complex .",
    "these complexes are parameterized by a _ degree vector _ @xmath0 . when the complex has two terms , its determinant is that of a matrix expressing the map between these terms , and equals the resultant . in this case , there is a _",
    "determinantal _ formula , and",
    "the corresponding vector @xmath1 is _",
    "determinantal_. the resultant matrix is then said to be _ exact _ , or _ optimal _ , in the sense that there is no extraneous factor in the determinant .",
    "as is typical in all such approaches , including this paper , the polynomial coefficients are assumed to be sufficiently generic for the resultant , as well as any extraneous factor , to be nonzero .    in  @xcite , the unmixed multihomogeneous systems for which a determinantal formula exists were classified , but no formula was given ;",
    "see also  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect.13.2 ) . identifying explicitly the corresponding morphisms and the vectors @xmath1 was the focus of  @xcite .",
    "the main result of  @xcite was to establish that a determinantal formula of sylvester type exists ( for unmixed systems ) precisely when the condition of  @xcite holds on the cardinalities of the groups of variables and their degrees . in ( * ? ? ? *",
    "thm.2 ) all such formulae are characterized by showing a bijection with the permutations of the variable groups and by defining the corresponding vector @xmath1 .",
    "this includes all known sylvester - type formulae , in particular , of linear systems , systems of two univariate polynomials , and bihomogeneous systems of 3 polynomials whose resultant is , respectively , the coefficient determinant , the sylvester resultant and the classic dixon formula .    in @xcite , they characterized all determinantal cayley - koszul complexes , which are instances of _ weyman complexes _ when all the higher cohomologies vanish . in @xcite , this characterization",
    "is extended to the whole class of unmixed weyman complexes .",
    "it is also shown that there exists a determinantal pure bzout - type resultant formula if and only if there exists such a sylvester - type formula .",
    "explicit choices of determinantal vectors are given for any matrix type , as well as a choice yielding pure bzout type formulae , if one exists .",
    "the same work provides tight bounds for the coordinates of all possible determinantal vectors and , furthermore , constructs a family of ( rectangular ) pure sylvester - type formulae among which lies the smallest such formula .",
    "this paper shall extend these results to unmixed systems with scaled supports .",
    "studies exist , e.g.  @xcite , for computing hybrid formulae for the resultant in specific cases . in  @xcite , the koszul and cech cohomologies are studied in the mixed multihomogeneous case so as to define the resultant in an analogous way to the one used in section  [ resultants ] . in @xcite ,",
    "hybrid resultant formulae were proposed in the mixed homogeneous case ; this work is generalized here to multihomogeneous systems .",
    "similar approaches are applied to tate complexes  @xcite to handle mixed systems .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows : firstly , we establish the analog of the bounds given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect.3 ) ; in so doing , we simplify their proof in the unmixed case .",
    "we characterize the scaled systems that admit a determinantal formula , either pure or hybrid .",
    "if pure determinantal formulae exist , we explicitly provide the @xmath1-vectors that correspond to them . in the search for determinantal formulae we discover box domains that consist of determinantal vectors thus improving the wide search for these vectors adopted in  @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that a formula of minimum dimension can be recovered from the centers of such boxes , analogous to the homogeneous case .",
    "second , we make the differentials in the weyman complex explicit and provide details of the computation .",
    "note that the actual construction of the matrix , given the terms of the complex , is nontrivial .",
    "our study has been motivated by @xcite , where similar ideas are used in the ( unmixed ) examples of their section  7 , with some constructions which we specify in example  [ unmixedexamsylv ] . finally , we deliver a complete , publicly available  package for the computation of multihomogeneous resultant matrices .",
    "based on the software of @xcite , it has been enhanced with new functions , including some even for the unmixed case , such as the construction of resultant matrices and the efficient storage of complexes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with sparse multihomogeneous resultants and weyman complexes in section  [ resultants ] below .",
    "section  [ determinantal ] presents bounds on the coordinates of all determinantal vectors and classifies the systems that admit hybrid and pure determinantal formulae ; explicit vectors are provided for pure formulae and minimum dimension choices are conjectured . in section  [ matconstr ]",
    "we construct the actual matrices ; we present sylvester- and bzout - type constructions that also lead to hybrid matrices .",
    "we conclude with the presentation of our  implementation along with examples of its usage .    some of these results have appeared in preliminary form in  @xcite .",
    "we define the resultant , and connect it to complexes by homological constructions .",
    "take the product @xmath2 of projective spaces over an algebraically closed field @xmath3 of characteristic zero , for @xmath4 .",

    "it is itself multihomogeneous in the coefficients of each @xmath29 , with degree given by the multihomogeneous bzout bound :    [ mbezout ] the resultant polynomial is homogeneous in the coefficients of each @xmath30 , with degree @xmath31    the degree @xmath32 of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath29 is the coefficient of @xmath34 in the new polynomial : @xmath35 in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect.4 ) the coefficient of @xmath34 in @xmath36 is shown to be equal to @xmath37 thus proving the formula in the unmixed case .",

    "this yields the total degree of the resultant , that is , @xmath39 .",
    "the rest of the section gives details on the underlying theory .",
    "the vanishing of the multihomogeneous resultant can be expressed as the failure of a complex of sheaves to be exact .",

    "the resultant complex can be computed in an efficient data structure that captures its combinatorial information and allows us to compute the corresponding matrix .",

    "the critical degree is @xmath651 , thus @xmath652 yields the self - dual formula .",
    "since the remaining 16 vectors come in dual pairs , we only mention one formula for each pair ; finally , the first 3 formulae listed have a symmetric formula , due to the symmetries present to our data , so it suffices to list @xmath653 distinct formulae .",
    "note that the determinantal vectors are exactly the vectors in these boxes .",
