    "[ subba ] we can distinguish two different field regimes . at low fields ,",

    "carriers are either homogeneously distributed around the hetero - interface or form 1d and 2d channels according to the device parameters . in the latter case",
    ", we expect the direction of the field to have a remarkable impact . therefore , we next compare pl spectra with the field oriented in two non - equivalent directions , namely perpendicular to the top / bottom facets ( @xmath110 ) and along a maximal diameter ( @xmath111 ) .",

    "the spectra exhibit the same qualitative behavior , with several emission lines at low @xmath69 which reduce to one peak ( ground e - h state ) at larger fields .",
    "however , the emission intensity is anisotropic , especially at high field intensity . at @xmath112  t",
    ", the peak intensity at @xmath111 is about twice as strong as the one at @xmath110 .",
    "this is due to the different localization of the @xmath77 electron and hole states at @xmath78 , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ anisitropy ] .",
    "the hole state shows two lobes localized by the strong carrier - carrier repulsion towards the bottom and top facets ( at @xmath110 ) or corners ( at @xmath111 ) .",
    "since the facet - to - facet distance is the shorter , due to coulomb interaction the energy of the state in the first configuration turns out to be a few tenths of mev greater than the one with the field along the maximal diameter . as a consequence ,",
    "its occupation is smaller .",
    "the electron states elongate in the field direction and , also in this case , the energy level obtained at @xmath110 turns out to be greater than the one found at @xmath111 , and this yields a discrepancy in the occupation of the states .",
    "thus , the higher population of both @xmath77 hole and electron states leads to the stronger intensity of the ground e - h state emission line at @xmath111 with respect to the one found at @xmath110 .",
    "we have investigated theoretically the magneto - optical properties of hole and electron gases in gaas / alas core - multishell nws which are either @xmath1- or @xmath0-doped and subject to a transverse magnetic field .",
    "the tailoring of pl spectra by the field has been rationalized in different doping regimes .",
    "calculations were performed by means of a self - consistent mean - field approach , with the inclusion of photogenerated hole - electron pairs that add to the free carriers induced by the modulation doping .",
    "our results indicate that the behavior of magneto - pl spectra offers a valuable guideline to estimate the density of the doping in cms nws .",
    "in fact , when the density of free carriers due to the doping is greater than the one of photogenerated charges , the spectra are quite simple and only the emission line due to the ground e - h state survives at high fields . differently , when the excitation power is larger and the density of photoexcited carriers is comparable or higher with respect to the doping - induced free charge , several pl peaks are found , that can be ascribed to recombinations from specific excited states , whose character is , in turn , strongly modified by the magnetic field .",
    "we found a remarkable difference between samples with either electron or holes as majority carriers .",
    "indeed , at low magnetic fields and low photoexcitation power , the qualitative behavior of pl spectra for @xmath1- and @xmath0-doped sample is quite similar although , in the case of @xmath1-doping , the number of emissions lines is greater than the one found for the @xmath0-doped sample .",
    "this is a consequence of the different localization pattern of the majority carriers .",
    "still in the low - field regime , when the density of photo - created hole - electron pairs is significant , the emission lines exhibit a diamagnetic shift , in both samples .",
    "this shift becomes linear for higher magnetic fields .",
    "however , the main peak , due to the ground e - h state , deviates from the expected behavior at low values of density of photogenerated hole - electron pairs .",
    "specifically , in the intermediate field regime , it exhibits a kink ( @xmath0-doping ) or a flat region ( @xmath1-doping ) . in both cases",
    "this is due to the rearrangement of the gas of holes , whose heavier effective mass eases their localization near the interface with respect to the electrons . in the high power excitation regime ,",
    "the large coulomb interaction prevents the hole gas rearrangement .",
    "the differences in the magneto - pl spectra illustrated in this work are a valuable tool to discriminate not only the free - carrier density regime and type , but also the relative density of doping- and photoexcitation - induced carriers .",
    "this , together with the assessment of the free - carrier spatial distribution , is pivotal in the characterization and engineering of cms nws .",
