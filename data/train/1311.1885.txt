    "one of the control design approaches , which perhaps is one of the most popular nonlinear control design approaches and has been widely and successfully applied in fields ranging from aerospace to process control @xcite , is gain scheduling .",
    "gas turbine engines are no exception , and research on gain scheduling of gas turbine engines is presented in @xcite .    when the operation of a control system is highly critical due to human safety factors or the high cost of failure in damaged capital or products , the software designers have to expend more effort to validate and verify their software before it can be released . in flight - critical operations , validation and verification are part of the flight certification process @xcite .",
    "software system certification involves many challenges , including the necessity to certify the system at the level of functional requirements , code and binary levels , the need to detect run - time errors , and the need for proving timing properties of the eventual , compiled system @xcite .",
    "provable closed - loop stability constitutes an essential attribute of control systems , especially when human safety is involved , as in many aeronautical systems like gas turbine engines .",
    "motivated by such applications , there exist many theorems to support system stability and performance under various assumptions @xcite .",

    "the gas turbine engine model used in this study is a high fidelity model of dgen 380 turbofan engine provided as a virtual test bench by price induction @xcite .",
    "brief descriptions of the dgen engine and its virtual test bench are given below .",
    "price induction , a french aerospace company based out of biarritz , has been designing for the past 10 years a family of engines designed specifically for general aviation .",
    "these dgen engines are optimized for a cruise altitude ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 ft , at speed up to mach 0.35 and with a flight ceiling limited to 25,000 ft . to be competitive with piston engines , they were also designed to have low specific fuel consumption ( sfc ) , be lightweight and reasonably priced to allow the emergence of 4 to 5-seat light aircraft with a max weight ranging between 1,400 kg and 2,150 kg ( 3,417 lb and 5,622 lb ) commonly called personal light jets ( plj ) .",
    "the dgen 380 , the first engine of its family shown in figure [ fig : dgen ] , is a two - spool , high bypass ratio ( 7.6 ) , unmixed flow turbofan engine .",
    "its simple architecture yields up to 560 pounds of thrust in a compact and lightweight format ( 175 pounds and 4 feet long ) while maintaining low noise and pollution levels . beside its optimized performances ,",
    "the engine innovates with its all - electric system : its starter - generator located directly on the high - pressure shaft , and oil and fuel pumps driven by electric motors are controlled by the engine control unit ( ecu ) , allowing for a really fine and optimized tuning of the dgen control laws .",
    "based on its design expertise , price induction developed the westt ( whole engine simulator turbine technology ) solutions , which are educational and research tools based on the dgen 380 turbofan engine and intended for high schools , universities , aeronautical maintenance training centers and research institutes .",
    "the westt cs - bv , shown in figure [ fig : westt ] , is a product of this family dedicated to the study of the dgen 380 turbofan and its control . with the dgen 380 actual ecu hardware and its model running real - time and generating its sensors analog outputs",
    ", the cs - bv constitutes a great control hardware - in - the - loop ( hil ) platform for the testing of engine control design .",
    "the mpc555 microcontroller which constitutes the core of the ecu can be easily programmed through the already existing code framework with different control logics and tested in real time with the use of the simmot ( engine real - time simulation ) .",
    "all engine outputs are displayed on screen and all data recorded for later performance analysis .",
    "the lyapunov matrices which are computed in the next sections can be used at the level of the code in order to formally verify its stability .",
    "indeed the sublevel sets of the lyapunov functions they represent are invariant sets in which the variables remain throughout the execution of the program .",
    "the concept of invariants is familiar to the computer scientists that seek them in computer programs .",
    "however , a general computer program lacks the nice mathematical structures that exist in control systems , which makes it hard to compute invariants for the general computer code .",
    "instead , we target control systems by developing a control domain - specific framework of _ credible autocoding _ and implementing it using a number of existing tools that we have extended . a high level view of the credible autocoding framework is given in figure [ fig : verified_process ] .",
    "it enables the control engineer to provide the control semantics such as the proof of lyapunov stability directly on the simulink diagram .",
    "this part of the framework of can be both manual or automated .",
    "the implementation of the framework is done by extending an simulink to c translation tool named gene - auto @xcite to generate formal annotations in additional to the c code .",
    "these annotation describe the invariant sets in which the variables will remain .",
    "the sets are extracted automatically from the lyapunov matrices . the formal annotation language used at the level of the c code",
    "is called acsl ( ansi / iso c specification language ) @xcite",
    ". it can be read by various formal analysis tools such as frama - c @xcite . in order to prove the validity of the generated annotations ,",
    "we have extended these tools with domain - specific , automated routines that discharge the proof based on control - theoretic techniques .",
    "the fadec used for numerical analysis is a dgen 380 turbofan engine controller model provided by price induction .",
    "the main novelty with this fadec is that it is intended to be adaptable to different components such as a different compressor or turbine .",
    "the engine controller is developed using gain scheduling , and the scheduling parameter is the engine high pressure spool speed , i.e. @xmath4 .      the initial model requires extensive changes before it become compatible with our tool - chain .",
    "the majority of the changes required are not due to the simulink blocks but rather because of the heavy presence of matlab functions in the model .",
    "a large portion of modifications are made to the parts of the model that is not directly related to the controller .",
    "the model is consisted of three major subsystems .",
    "the first major subsystem is the throttle subsystem .",
    "this subsystem generates turbine commands nh and nl from the throttle input pla .",
    "this subsystem is mostly written in matlab and therefore need to be completely re - implemented in simulink .",
    "the second major subsystem is the controller which contained transfer functions , and a polynomial curves - based lookup table .",
    "both type of blocks are not supported by our tool - chain hence need to be converted into subsystems consisted of more basic blocks .",
    "the overall controller is consisted of dual pid subsystems with a basic anti - windup mechanism on both pid controllers .",
    "the last major subsystem is the butee which contained safety features such as saturation operators and min / max switching strategies that are designed to prevent controller commands that could cause the turbine to exceed its maximum operational safety limits .",
    "this part of the model also requires extensive alteration as most of the butee is written in matlab .      in this section ,",
    "we give a description of the open - loop stability characteristics of the fadec .",
    "these results are to be used to annotate the simulink model and then transformed by our credible compilation tool - chain down to acsl annotations for the c code .    from the simulink model of fadec provided by price induction ,",
    "the semantics of the controller is extracted and then reformulated as a discrete - time state - space system .",
    "let the controller states be denoted by the vector @xmath5 .",
    "the controller states are x^c= b_0 & b_1 & _ 0 & _ 1 & c_0 & c_1 & f_0 & f_1 & b_2 & _ 2 & c_2 ^. [ controller_states ] the symbols @xmath6 represent the integrator states , and the symbols @xmath7 denote the states of the anti - windup mechanisms .",
    "the states @xmath8 are the states of the first order filters used in the derivative portion of the two pid controllers .",
    "we have @xmath9 as one of the input to the controller y_1 = nh nl [ input:01 ] .",
    "the symbols @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the changes to the high and low pressure turbine spool speeds commanded by the throttle subsystem .",
    "the output from the controller , denoted as @xmath12 , is the input to the butee subsystem .",
    "the butee component is a safety limiter on the signal @xmath13 .",
    "the output from the butee , denoted as @xmath14 , is the input to the engine fuel pump .",
    "there is a feedback loop to the controller .",
    "this feedback loop to the controller contains two signals .",
    "one is the output from the butee @xmath14 and the other is @xmath15 which is a vector consisted of the anti - windup states @xmath16 .",
    "both signals are delayed by one sample period in the feedback loop .",
    "the symbols @xmath1 and @xmath0 denote the angular velocity of the high - pressure and low - pressure spools .",
    "the pid controller gains are computed using polynomial functions @xmath17 that map @xmath1 to a set of gains p_1 : nh k_p p_2 : nh k_i p_3 : nh",
    "k_d p_4 : nh t_d .",
    "[ gains ] let the parameter ( ) = p_1 ( ) & p_2 ( ) & p_3 ( ) & p_4 ( ) [ parameter ] denote the set of pid gains for some @xmath3 .",
    "the state - space transition function and the output function of the fadec can be defined using the following parameter - varying matrices .",
    "a^c ( ) ^11 11 , & b^c ( ) ^11 2 , & b^c_u_2 ( ) ^11 3 , & b^c _ ( ) ^11 1 c^c_1 ( ) ^1 11 , & c^c_2 ( ) ^3 11 , & d^c_1 ( ) ^1 2 [ abcd ] the matrices are varying in a nonlinear fashion with the parameter @xmath18 .",

    "for the sake of brevity , we have chosen not to display the closed - form expression of the parameter varying matrices in ( [ fadecss ] ) as they are very large .",
    "we now seek to compute an ellipsoid invariant for ( [ fadecss ] ) .",
    "there were several issues with the fadec model that presented a challenge towards finding a single ellipsoid invariant :    1 .",
    "there is a sample delay on the input vector @xmath27 .",
    "this precluded the usage of a simple quadratic function @xmath28 for the stability analysis .",
    "instead , a lyapunov - krasovskii type functional @xmath29 is needed to handle the sample delay .",
    "however the resulting lmi can not be solved by sedumi .",
    "a convex hull of the system matrices is needed since the system matrices are not linearly parameter - varying .",
    "the butee component contained complex safety limiters in addition to the simple saturation operators .",
    "we discuss each of these issues in the ensuing sections .",
    "the problem with the sample delay was resolved simply by its removal .",
    "we shifted some of the dynamics in the controller forward by one sample and removed the one sample delay on @xmath30 so that the signal @xmath27 no longer need to be delayed by one sample .",
    "the changes are small enough that the performance of the controller is not noticeably affected as indicated by the simulations . without the sample delay on @xmath27 , the system in ( [ fadecss ] )",
    "becomes the following state - space system x^c_+ = ^c ( ) x^c + ^c ( ) u = c^c ( ) x^c + d^c ( ) y [ fadecss2 ] with a new state - transition matrix @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "there are two modes of operation to the butee .",
    "the simple operational mode of the butee is consisted of two identical saturation operator that restricts the input to the butee and the output from the butee to the interval @xmath34 .",
    "we can model the saturation nonlinearities using a sector - bound inequality .",

    "we can assume a simple bound on the output of the butee even when this mode is switched on .",

    "these snapshots illustrate evolution of both engine spool speeds that closely follow their reference signals , and also engine fuel and oil pressure time histories .    a visualizations of the engine related avionics",

    "the snapshot shows real - time measurement of pressures ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 ) , temperatures ( @xmath112 , and @xmath113 ) , speeds ( @xmath1 , and @xmath0 ) , thrust , fuel pump rating , oil pump rating , fuel consumption , fuel pressure , and oil pressure .",
    "a stability proof was presented for the closed - loop dgen 380 turbofan engine system with its gain scheduled controller based on the lyapunov stability theory . using convex optimization tools , various numerical values of the lyapunov stability matrix , for the closed - loop system and the controller , were computed separately . with these stability matrices ,",
    "ellipsoid invariant sets were constructed , which were used efficiently for dgen turbofan engine control code stability analysis and verification .",
    "the verifiable engine controller code then implemented successfully on the engine virtual test bench ( westt ) to control a high fidelity dgen 380 engine model .",
