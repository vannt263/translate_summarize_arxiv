    "the empirical relations between the mass of the central supermassive black hole ( bh ) and the properties of the spheroid ( ellipticals and classical bulges of spirals ) such as stellar - velocity dispersion @xmath6 @xcite , stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "are thought to represent a stage in the evolution of galaxies in which the supermassive bh is actively growing through accretion .    to understand the origin of the bh mass ( @xmath2 ) scaling relations , our group has been studying their evolution with cosmic time @xcite . to distinguish mechanisms causing evolution in @xmath6 ( e.g. , dissipational merger events ) and @xmath7  ( e.g. , through passive evolution due to aging of the stellar population , or dissipationless mergers )",
    ", we simultaneously study both the @xmath2-@xmath6 and @xmath2-@xmath7  relations for a sample of low - luminous agns , seyfert-1 galaxies , at @xmath11 and 0.6 ( lookback time 4 - 6 gyrs ) .",
    "our results reveal an offset with respect to the local relationships which can not be accounted for by known systematic uncertainties .",
    "the evolutionary trend we find ( e.g. , @xmath2/@xmath7@xmath12 @xmath13 , including selection effects ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that bh growth precedes spheroid assembly .",
    "several other studies have found results in qualitative agreement with ours , over different ranges in black hole mass and redshifts , and with different observing techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    however , to study the evolution of the @xmath2  scaling relations , it is crucial to understand slope and scatter of the local relations . in particular ,",
    "an open question is whether quiescent galaxies and active galaxies follow the same relations , as expected if the nuclear activity was just a transient phase in the life - cycle of galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite presented the @xmath2-@xmath6  relation for a sample of 24 active galaxies in the local universe , for which the bh mass was derived via reverberation mapping ( rm ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they find a slope ( @xmath14 ) and intrinsic scatter ( @xmath15 ) which are indistinguishable from that of quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) within the uncertainties , supporting the scenario in which active galaxies are an evolutionary stage in the life cycle of galaxies .",
    "while the great advantage of such a study is the multi - epoch data which provide more reliable measurements of the bh mass , such a quality comes at the expense of quantity .",
    "studies based on larger samples drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) infer the bh mass indirectly from single - epoch spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they hinted at a shallower @xmath2-@xmath6  relation than that observed for quiescent samples , but the available dynamic range is too small to be conclusive .",
    "in particular , the relation above 10@xmath16 m@xmath4 is very poorly known , which has profound implications for evolutionary studies that by necessity focus on this mass range .",
    "however , there is another uncertainty in the @xmath2-@xmath6  relation that arises when measuring @xmath6 from fiber - based sdss data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also from the unresolved `` aperture spectra '' for more distant galaxies ( e.g. , our studies on the evolution of the @xmath2-@xmath6  relation ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a significant fraction ( @xmath1715/40 ) of our distant sample of seyfert-1 galaxies have morphologies of sa or later @xcite . given the diversity of morphologies of agn hosts , it is most likely that there is a degree of rotational support : if the disk is seen edge - on , the disk rotation can bias @xmath6 towards higher values .",
    "however , since the disk is kinematically cold , it can also result in the opposite effect , i.e.  biassing @xmath6 towards smaller values , if the disk is seen face on ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . either way",
    ", it questions the connection between the `` global '' dispersion measured by those experiments and the spheroid - only dispersion which may in fact scale more tightly with bh mass .",
    "more generally , measuring @xmath6 in type-1 agns is complicated by the presence of strong emission lines and a continuum that dilutes the starlight .",
    "@xmath6 can be measured from different spectral regions with different merits and complications ( * ? ? ? * for inactive galaxies",
    "see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally , there is are different @xmath6 measurements in use : e.g. , the luminosity - weighted line - of - sight velocity dispersion within the spheroid effective radius ( @xmath18 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the central velocity dispersions normalized to an aperture of radius equal to 1/8 of the galaxy effective radius ( @xmath19 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "shedding light on the issues outlined above is essential to understand what aspects of galaxy formation and agn activity are connected , but it requires spatially - resolved kinematic information for a large sample of local agns . for this purpose , we selected a sample of @xmath20100 local ( 0.02 @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath0 0.1 ) seyfert-1 galaxies from the sdss ( dr6 ) with @xmath2@xmath3m@xmath4 and obtained high - quality longslit spectra with keck / lris . from the keck spectra , we derive the bh mass and measure the spatially - resolved stellar - velocity dispersion from three different spectral regions ( around cah+k@xmath213969,3934 ; around mgib @xmath225167,5173,5184  triplet ; and around ca ii@xmath228498,8542,8662  triplet ) . the spectra are complemented by archival sdss images ( g , r , i , z ) on which we perform surface photometry using a newly developed code to determine the spheroid effective radius , spheroid luminosity , and the host - galaxy free 5100  luminosity of the agn ( for an accurate bh mass measurement ) .",
    "our code allows a joint multi - band analysis to disentangle the agn which dominates in the blue from the host galaxy that dominates in the red .",
    "the resulting multi - filter spheroid luminosities allow us to estimate spheroid stellar masses .    combining the results from spectroscopic and imaging analysis , we can study four different bh mass scaling relations ( namely @xmath2-@xmath6 , @xmath2-@xmath7 , @xmath2-@xmath8 , and @xmath2-@xmath9 ) . in this paper",

    "two of these are seen close to face - on ( ngc2273 and ngc2960 ; their fig . 6 and 7 ) in which case",
    "the effect of the disk component on the stellar - velocity dispersion measured from aperture spectra can not explain the observed offset . only for ngc6323 , for which the disk is seen close to edge - on ( their fig .",
    "6 ) could the observed offset indeed be due to rotational broadening . from our fig .",
    "[ sigma_spat_ap ] , we estimate that the stellar velocity dispersion measured from aperture spectra can overestimate that from spatially resolved measurements by up to @xmath2040% in case of rotational broadening by a disk component seen edge on - large enough to move ngc6323 close to the local relation defined by ellipticals . to conclude , while for individual objects , the effect of a disk on the derived stellar - velocity dispersion from aperture spectra can be significant",
    ", it can not explain the offset observed by @xcite for their full sample of megamasers .",
    ", i.e.  luminosity - weighted stellar - velocity dispersion within effective radius as determined from spatially - resolved spectra and @xmath42 as determined from spectra extracted with an aperture equal to the effective radius , as function of effective radius .",
    "the upper panel shows all objects for which the host galaxy has been classified as ellipticals , the middle panel objects with s0/a - type host - galaxy morphology , and the lower panel objects hosted by spirals .",
    "the triangles ( circles ) correspond to galaxies seen edge - on ( face - on ) .",
    "the error bars are omitted for clarity , measurement errors on the ratios range between 5 - 10% . ]",
    "when comparing stellar - velocity dispersion measurements from the three different spectral regions , the overall picture is that they agree within the errors .",
    "a more quantitative comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ sigmacompare ] . for the aperture data ,",
    "three extreme outliers were excluded in this figure due to contaminating broad agn emission lines and featureless continuum swamping the blue spectral region ( namely 0353 - 0623 , 1049 + 2451 , 1535 + 5754 ; see also fig .",
    "[ sigmaall ] ) .",
    "these outliers are shown in the one - to - one plot of @xmath78 vs. @xmath79 and @xmath80 within the effective radii as open symbols ( fig .",
    "[ sigmacompare]b ) .",
    "( note that none of the objects was excluded for the spatially - resolved data , explaining the higher scatter . )    in general , for the spatially - resolved stellar - velocity dispersions ( fig .",
    "[ sigmacompare]a , left panels ) both ratios @xmath70/@xmath81 and @xmath70/@xmath82 scatter at the 20 - 30% level .",
    "the average @xmath70/@xmath81 ratio shows a slight dependence on radius in the sense that measuring @xmath33 from the mgib region in the center tends to underpredict the `` true '' @xmath33 ( here assumed to be @xmath70 ) by on average 5 - 10% while it gets overpredicted in the outerparts by on average @xmath2010 - 15% .",
    "this trend with radius can be attributed to the agn contamination from emission lines and featureless continuum that is only present in the inner most spectra , and results not only in an increased error in the determined velocity dispersion but also in a possible bias .",
    "the ratio @xmath70/@xmath83 , on the other hand , shows no clear trend with radius ; generally , measuring @xmath33 from the cahk region overpredicts the `` true '' @xmath33 by on average 5 - 10% .",
    "note that there is no obvious trend with galaxy morphology .    for the average ratio from the aperture spectra ( fig .",
    "[ sigmacompare]a , right panels ) , the trend is similar to the spatially - resolved stellar - velocity dispersions for small apertures . at larger radii , the average ratio for both @xmath71/@xmath84 and @xmath71/@xmath85 approaches unity . for @xmath71/@xmath85",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the dependence on radius seen in the spatially - resolved ratio cancels out .    for the stellar velocity dispersion within the effective radius ( fig .",
    "[ sigmacompare]b ) , all ratios are unity within the errors ( @xmath70/@xmath83 = 1.01@xmath450.06 ; rms scatter = 0.28 ; @xmath70/@xmath81 = 1.03@xmath450.04 ; rms scatter = 0.22 ; @xmath71/@xmath85 = 0.98@xmath450.03 ; rms scatter = 0.15 ) , except for the stellar - velocity dispersion measured in the cahk region from aperture spectra that tend to overpredict @xmath71 by on average 6% ( @xmath71/@xmath84 = 0.94@xmath450.03 ; rms scatter = 0.12 ) .    to estimate the effect of the potential bias induced when using the mgib region to determine the stellar - velocity dispersion for the study of the evolution of the @xmath2-@xmath66  scaling relation ( as done for our @xmath1@xmath200.4 seyfert-1 sample ; @xcite ) , we take into account that typically , an aperture much larger than the actual effective radius ( a factor of @xmath202.8 for @xcite ) is used for extraction of the spectra ( see above ) .",
    "we find no bias ( @xmath71/@xmath85 = 0.98@xmath450.04 ; rms scatter = 0.17 ) .",
    "the general conclusion we can draw from this comparison is that while the cat region is the cleanest region to determine stellar - velocity dispersions , both the mgib region , appropriately corrected for feii emission , and the cahk region , although often swamped by the blue agn powerlaw continuum and strong agn emission lines , can also give accurate results within a few percent , given high s / n spectra .",
    "this is an important improvement over the study by @xcite who use fiber - based sdss spectra ( i.e.  aperture spectra with a radius of 1.5 ) for a sample of 40 type-1 agns for a similar comparison but find a bias of the order of 20 - 30% ( in both mgib , not corrected for feii emission , and cahk ) .",
    "furthermore , spatially - resolved spectra are very helpful as they allow to eliminate the agn contamination ( powerlaw continuum and strong emission lines ) especially prominent in the blue spectra ( cahk and mgib region ) when extracting spectra outside of the nucleus .          we can now create four different bh mass scaling relations , namely @xmath2-@xmath6 , @xmath2-@xmath7 , @xmath2-@xmath8 , and @xmath2-@xmath9  and compare our results with literature data (   [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "the resulting relations are shown in figs .",
    "[ mbh_s ] and  [ mbh_scaling ] .",
    "the distribution of residuals with respect to the fiducial local relations ( table  [ fits ] ) are shown as histograms .    in fig .",
    "[ mbh_s ] , we plot @xmath43 from aperture spectra within 1.5as stellar - velocity dispersion of our sample , for comparison with literature data , for which all measurement were derived from apertures spectra ( with different sizes , see   [ sec : comp ] ; we here use 1.5  to be comparable to sdss fiber spectra ) .",
    "overall , our sample follows the same @xmath2-@xmath6  relation as that of the other active local galaxies and also that of inactive galaxies . for the local agns with stellar velocity dispersion measurements from sdss fiber spectra ( green data points in fig .",
    "[ mbh_s ] ) , @xcite already noticed that these objects seem to follow a shallower @xmath2-@xmath6  relation with an apparent offset at the low - mass end in the sense that the stellar velocity dispersion is smaller than expected . the same trend may also to be visible for the rm agns ( blue data points , @xcite ) and our local active galaxies ( red data points ) .",
    "however , for our data points , this trend can be attributed to five objects ( 0121 - 0102 , 0846 + 2522 , 1250 - 0249 , 1535 + 5754 , and 1605 + 3305 ) that might simply be outliers , with strong agn contamination , especially in the aperture spectra . however , at this point , the available dynamic range is too small to distinguish between a real offset / change in slope or simply a rising scatter .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath7  relation indicates that our sample of active galaxies resides in host galaxies that are overluminous compared to the inactive galaxies ( on average by 0.15@xmath450.08 dex ; rms scatter : 0.4 ) .",
    "one potential bias here could be that , due to the shallow images , we are missing the disk contribution and thus overestimating the bulge luminosity for objects that we classified as ellipticals and fitted by a spheroidal component only ( see also   [ ssec : host ] ) .",
    "however , the distribution of residuals with respect to the fiducial relation of inactive galaxies shows that especially host galaxies classified as spirals contribute to this offset ( offset 0.2 dex@xmath450.07 dex ; rms scatter : 0.37 ) , arguing against such a bias .",
    "in fact , such an offset might not be too surprising for two reasons : ( i ) the @xcite sample only includes ellipticals and s0/a in the luminosity plot and ( ii ) the enhanced luminosity might be due to starformation triggered from a same event that triggered the agn .",
    "that agns are often hosted by actively star - forming galaxies has been found in various studies at different redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we can not exclude that at least some of the spiral galaxies have pseudobulges which are characterized by surface - brightness profiles closer to exponential profiles ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) . as discussed in appendix",
    "[ sec : mattscode ] , using a srsic index of @xmath86 instead of @xmath87 for the spheroid component can decrease the spheroid luminosity by @xmath200.2 dex , thus accounting for at least some of the offset .",
    "we will explore this effect further when analysing the full sample .    for both the @xmath2-@xmath8  and @xmath2-@xmath9  relations ,",
    "our objects seem to follow the relations determined by the inactive galaxies .",
    "note that we have a small sample size and also a small dynamic range in the parameters covered and all four bh mass scaling relations presented here show a large scatter .",
    "thus , we refrain from discussing the results any further at this point but will get back to the local bh mass scaling relations in more detail when we have the full sample available .           +       llcccc @xmath88 & rm agns & 8@xmath450.14 & 3.55@xmath450.60 & 0.43@xmath450.08 & woo+10@xmath28 + & inactive galaxies & 8.12@xmath450.08 & 4.24@xmath450.41 & 0.44@xmath450.06 & gltekin+09 + @xmath89 & inactive galaxies & 8.95@xmath450.01 & 1.11@xmath450.18 & 0.38@xmath450.09 & gltekin+09 + @xmath90 & inactive galaxies & -3.34@xmath451.91 & 1.09@xmath450.18 & 0.38@xmath450.1 & here + @xmath91 & inactive galaxies & -0.98@xmath451.31 & 0.84@xmath450.12 & 0.54@xmath450.08 & here + [ fits ]",

    "we determine the spheroid effective radius , spheroid luminosity , and the host - galaxy free 5100  agn continuum luminosity .",
    "combining the results from spectroscopy and imaging allows us to estimate bh masses via the empirically calibrated photo - ionization method from the width of the h@xmath5 emission line and the host - galaxy free 5100  agn continuum luminosity .",
    "the spheroid effective radius is used to determine the luminosity - weighted stellar - velocity dispersion within @xmath67 .",
    "the spheroid luminosities in four different bands are used to calculate stellar masses .",
    "also , our results allow us to estimate dynamical masses .",
    "we can thus study four different bh mass scaling relations : @xmath2-@xmath6 , @xmath2-@xmath7 , @xmath2-@xmath8 , and @xmath2-@xmath9 .",
    "the main results for the pilot study can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "the host galaxies show a wide variety of morphologies with a significant fraction of spiral galaxies and prominent rotation curves .",
    "this underscores the need for spatially - resolved stellar - velocity dispersions .",
    "* we find a lower merger rate than for our higher redshift study , comparable to inactive galaxies in the local universe . * determining stellar - velocity dispersions from aperture spectra ( such as sdss fiber spectra or unresolved data from distant galaxies ) can be biased , depending on the size of the extracted region , agn contamination , and the host - galaxy morphology .",
    "an overestimation of the stellar velocity dispersion from aperture spectra is due to broadening from an underlying rotation component ( if seen edge - on ) , an underestimation can originate from the contribution of the dynamically cold disk ( if seen face on ) .",
    "however , comparing with the higher - redshift seyfert-1 sample of @xcite , we find that , on average , such a bias is small ( @xmath920.03 dex ) and , moreover , in the opposite direction to explain the offset seen in the @xmath2-@xmath6  relation . *",
    "the cat region is the cleanest region to determine stellar - velocity dispersion in agn hosts .",

    "spatially - resolved data are very helpful to eliminate the agn contamination by extracting spectra outside of the nucleus . *",

    "the imaging results of this paper rely on a new surface photometry code that we have developed (   [ ssec : phot ] ) . here",
    "we describe the code in detail and discuss the sdss photometric data and how the code was used to fit surface brightness models to these data .",
    "surface photometry and structural modeling of imaging data , or spasmoid , written by mwa , is an image analysis code designed to supersede the functionality of galfit @xcite .",
    "the code employs a bayesian framework wherein the various model parameters ( e.g. , the centroid , total magnitude , effective radius , ellipticity , position angle , and/or srsic index ) can be tied together by priors ( i.e. , constraints ) _ between model components or across different filters_. for example , it is straightforward to impose a prior that the redder bands have smaller effective radii than the bluer bands , that the agn has blue colors related by a power - law of frequency , or that the relative position between the agn and the bulge is the same in all bands and the offset between these components must be small .",
    "the code also allows for a different psf model for extended objects and point sources ( this is useful if the different components have different colors ) , and can even use linear combinations of psfs for the agn to account for psf - mismatch , which may be particularly important for hst imaging .",
    "the code implements a mcmc sampler to explore degeneracies between the parameters and provide robust error estimates .",
    "a set of reduced data images is provided by the user along with variance images , image masks , meta data ( e.g. , the photometric zeropoints and the pixel scale in each image ) , and a starting guess for the parameters ( this can be substantially different than the best parameters , although a closer guess to the `` true '' value leads to more efficient sampling ) .",
    "a likelihood function is defined assuming gaussian uncertainties on the pixel values as described by the variance images , e.g. , @xmath94 priors on all relevant model parameters and  for more complicated models ",
    "hyperparameters are defined by the user , and the code uses the pymc python module to explore the posterior .",
    "we have tested our code on simulated and real data and have compared our results with those derived from galfit .",
    "we find that , for priors that approximate the implicit galfit priors , we are able to reproduce the galfit results (   [ ssec : mbhs ] ) .    a code as flexible as spasmoid is ideally suited for space - based data ; the spatial resolution and depth of the sdss photometry limits the utility of such a code , however , it still has its advantages .",
    "we now describe how the sdss data are prepared and subsequently modeled with spasmoid .",
    "first , we determine the magnitude zeropoint ( zp ) following the recipe described on the sdss dr7 webpage : @xmath95 with @xmath96 = zeropoint count rate and @xmath97 = extinction coefficient taken from the `` tsfield '' header keywords for a given field and filter , and exptime = 53.91 sec .",
    "then , the sky was subtracted using either the sky value in the image header ( if present ) or as determined independently directly from the image ( note that the 1000-counts bias was also subtracted ) .",
    "we created noise images ( in counts ) according to @xmath98 with data images in counts and gain and dark_variance taken from the `` tsfield '' header keywords .",
    "then , for convolution with the psf of the sloan telescope optics , we use a gaussian with the parameters given in the `` objall '' table of sdss for a given object and filter ( `` mrrccpsf_filter '' , `` me1psf_filter '' , `` me2psf_filter '' ) .",
    "the average seeing @xmath99 for the 25 objects was @xmath100 = 1.35@xmath450.15 , @xmath101 = 1.24@xmath450.15 , @xmath102=1.14@xmath450.15 , @xmath103=1.16@xmath450.14 .        for comparison , we ran galfit on all objects , in a very similar fashion as described in detail in @xcite",
    ". in short , we first fit the central agn component with a psf , thus determining the center of the system which was subsequently fixed to all components .",
    "the psf used was created as a circular gaussian with an fwhm corresponding to the seeing , derived from the parameter `` mrrccpsf_filter '' by @xmath104 .",
    "we then fitted a two component model only , consisting of a psf and a @xcite profile .",
    "the starting parameters for the galfit runs were taken from the sdss dr7 catalog , i.e.  psf magnitude ( `` psf_mags '' ) and @xcite magnitude ( `` devmag '' ) for the spheroid .",
    "the minimum radius of the @xcite profile was set to 2 pixels ( @xmath200.8 ) , i.e.  the minimum resolvable size given the seeing .      using the galfit results ( psf magnitude , location of psf , spheroid magnitude , spheroid effective radius , ellipticity and position angle ) as starting parameters , we assumed the following agn / host galaxy fitting procedure .",
    "we fit the host galaxy by either a single @xcite profile or by a @xcite plus an exponential profile to account for a disk , while the agn point source is modeled as the gaussian described for the convolution psf in the previous section .",
    "all of the components are concentric but the centroids may vary between bands to account for imperfect registration of the images .",
    "we also fix the effective radius to be the same in all bands ( i.e. , our photometry is similar to the modelmag photometry of sdss ) as well as the position angle and axis ratio , although these are free to vary between the bulge and disk component .",
    "again , the minimum radius of the @xcite profile was set to 2 pixels .",
    "the normalizations of the profiles  that is , the magnitudes of each component  are determined by generating models given the structural parameters ( centroid , effective radius , axis ratio , and position angle ) and finding the best coefficients of a linear fit of these models to the data . in principle the magnitudes could be free parameters of the mcmc sampler , but taking advantage of the linear nature of the fit allows us to very quickly find the ` optimal ' magnitudes for each proposed set of structural parameters .",
    "finally , depending on the images , residuals , and the @xmath31 statistics , we decide whether a given object is best fitted by three components ( psf , spheroid , disk ) or two components ( psf + spheroid ) .",
    "( this procedure is similar to the one adopted in @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "we subsequently applied correction for galactic extinction ( subtracting the sdss dr7 `` extinction_filter'' column ) .",
    "the resulting ab magnitudes were transformed to rest - frame optical bands by performing synthetic photometry on an early - type galaxy template spectrum , a procedure traditionally referred to as k - correction .",
    "the template spectrum initially has arbitrary units , and these units were adjusted so that the synthetic observed frame magnitudes match the magnitudes from our photometry .",
    "we then evaluated the v - band magnitudes at the rest - frame of the template ; luminosities were determined by correcting for the distance modulus given our adopted cosmology .",
    "the errors on extinction and rest - frame transformation are a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of @xmath920.05 mag ( using the scatter in 20 single stellar population templates with ages ranging from 2 gyr to 8 gyr ) .",
    "table  [ surface ] summarizes the results .",
    "note that our model assumes that the host galaxies can be best fitted by either a single @xcite profile or by a @xcite plus an exponential profile .",
    "however , some of the spiral galaxies may not have classical bulges , but pseudobulges which are characterized by surface - brightness profiles closer to exponential profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to test the most extreme systematic uncertainties in derived spheroid and psf magnitude , we re - ran our models for those 14 objects for which we fit a bulge plus disk component using a srsic index of @xmath86 instead of @xmath87 for the spheroid component .",
    "the results are comparable to what has already been observed by @xcite ( e.g.  their fig .",
    "10b ) : decreasing @xmath105 from 4 to 1 decreases the spheroid luminosity by on average 0.4 mag and increases the nuclear luminosity by on average 0.6 mag . at the same time , the disk luminosity increases by on average 0.1 mag .",
    "thus , the extreme systematic effect would move those objects up in bh mass by on average @xmath200.1 dex ( small , but not negligible compared to the assumed error of 0.4 dex ) and towards lower spheroid luminosities by @xmath200.2 dex .",
    "however , the image quality does not allow to determine the best srsic index , especially since the objects are complex in nature due to the presence of the agn for which a perfectly matching psf fit can not always be achieved and can result in degeneracies between psf and spheroid .",
    "a comparison between the results from our fit and galfit is shown in figs .",
    "[ mattgalfit1]-[mattgalfit2 ] , for the agn+spheroid decomposition .",
    "overall , the agreement is good , showing that our code performs as expected .",
    "in detail , the spheroid magnitudes agree to within 0.01@xmath450.02 magnitudes ( rms scatter : 0.08 ) with the largest difference at the faint end . for the psf magnitude , the difference can be larger , due to a fainter psf compared to the spheroid ; on average 0.36@xmath450.01 ( rms scatter : 0.33 ) .",
    "we use this comparison for a conservative estimate of our error bars , i.e.  spheroid and disk magnitude of 0.2 mag , psf magnitude of 0.5 mag , and total host magnitude of 0.1 mag .",
    "note that we apply constraints between the different filters which is not the case for galfit which is responsible for some of the discrepancies , e.g.  in effective radius ( fig .",
    "[ mattgalfit2 ] ) . while setting these constraints is less important for an agn+spheroid fit , it helps to solve the degeneracies for a three component fit .",
    "also , the psf differs slightly between our code and galfit as we use a circular gaussian for galfit but allow for an elliptical gaussian in our code ."
