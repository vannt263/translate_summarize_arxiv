    "despite a concerted effort by many researchers over the past few decades ( see , e.g. , the reviews by vandenberg , bolte & stetson 1996 , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , it has not been possible to reach a consensus on either the absolute or the relative ages of the galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "much of the controversy in this field can be traced to the difficulty of determining reliable values for the basic parameters that enter into a determination of the cluster age such as distance , reddening , overall metallicity and detailed abundance patterns .    in this respect ,",
    "the strmgren  @xmath1 photometric system offers unique advantages over broad - band photometry since it can provide precise estimates of @xmath10  , [ fe / h ] and surface gravity for f and g stars , as well as the reddening , on a star - by - star basis ( see schuster & and nissen 1989a and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , databases of quite homogeneous strmgren  photometry exist for large samples of stars , both metal  poor and metal  rich ( schuster & nissen 1988 ; @xcite ) .",
    "many of these stars have new , high - precision determinations of their parallaxes from the hipparcos   mission , making them particularly useful for distance determinations via the main  sequence fitting technique .",
    "moreover , since the strmgren  system includes a @xmath11 filter , which is entirely on the short wavelength side of the balmer jump , it can be used to probe the temperatures and gravities of horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars , including those on extended blue hbs ( @xcite ) .",
    "as is well known , considerable evidence has accumulated during the past @xmath12 years which indicates that red giants in globular clusters have mixed much deeper into their nuclear - burning interiors than canonical models predict  see , e.g. , kraft et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , @xcite and the reviews by @xcite and @xcite for discussions of the extensive literature on this subject . indeed , in order to explain the observed abundance patterns of c , n , o , na , al , and mg ( also see @xcite ; @xcite ) , it seems to be necessary for the mixing to penetrate so closely to the h - burning shell that some helium must also be dredged up into the surface layers during the evolution ( e.g. , @xcite , sweigart 1997a , b , and @xcite ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , even small amounts of he mixing could have large effects on the hb and account for at least part of the second - parameter phenomenon ( i.e. , the diversity in hb morphology among gcs having very similar chemical compositions ) .",
    "all of the m13 observations were obtained using the _ nordic optical telescope _  on la palma , canary islands , and strmgren  @xmath1  filters during the period from june 27 to july 02 , 1995 .",
    "the weather was excellent during the observing run , giving seeing values between 043 and 08 , with a mean value close to 060 .",
    "the detector used was a site 1024 square chip providing a total field of @xmath13 arcminutes .",
    "all photometric reductions of the cluster frames were carried out using daophot , allstar , allframe , and daogrow ( see stetson 1987 , 1990 , 1994 ) . in each frame , approximately 20000 stars were detected . for the standard stars the residuals in the transformation from the instrumental to the standard system were : @xmath14 : 0004 ; @xmath15 : 0005 ; @xmath16  : 0008 ; @xmath17  : 0010 and @xmath18 : 0008 . for m13 the error in the zero - point for each filter",
    "is estimated to be of order 001 .",
    "the data reduction procedures will be described in more detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "before attempting to determine the distance to m13 , it is necessary to know the amount of interstellar absorption towards the cluster as well as the stellar iron content ( preferably the detailed chemical abundance patterns ) .",
    "we have used our strmgren  photometry and the calibrations of schuster & nissen ( 1989a , eq .",
    "1 ) to determine the foreground reddening .",
    "a number of their calibrating stars were included as standards in our observing program to ensure that our photometric system would be close to theirs .",
    "the m13 stars used included turn  off and subgiants with @xmath14magnitudes between 17.5 and 20.5 ( @xmath19 stars ) . in this way",
    ", we derive a reddening of @xmath20 , or @xmath21 , which is quite typical of the values found for m13 ( e.g ,  @xcite ) .    in principle",
    ", the cluster metallicity can also be determined from strmgren   photometry . using ( again ) the calibrations of @xcite",
    ", we derive a mean metallicity of @xmath22$\\ } = -1.7 $ ] for @xmath19 stars .",
    "however , we found some indication of a possible error in the transformation of our instrumental @xmath23 magnitudes to the standard system as a function of @xmath16  and , since an error of 001 in the @xmath16  index corresponds to an error of @xmath24 dex in the estimated metallicity , the [ fe / h ] value that we have derived for m13 can not be considered robust . as a result ,",
    "we have adopted [ fe / h ] @xmath25 as a compromise of our photometric determination and recent spectroscopic results ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we adopt [ @xmath26fe ] @xmath6 which seems to be appropriate for the halo population ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are no measurements of this quantity in main - sequence or turnoff stars in m13 , but see @xcite and @xcite for pertinent discussions .",
    "ideally , the distance to m13 would be determined by a main - sequence fit of the c - m diagram for the unevolved cluster stars to a _",
    "large _ sample of local subdwarfs having the _ same _ metallicity as the cluster and very precise parallaxes .",
    "unfortunately , the number of subdwarfs with [ fe / h ] @xmath27 and with relative errors in their parallaxes at the few percent level remains small .",
    "potentially - useful subdwarf candidates were selected from the list of @xcite , with metallicities derived from strmgren  photometry and parallaxes determined by hipparcos  . as in the case of m13 , the individual reddenings and metallicities of the subdwarfs were determined using the calibrations of @xcite .    following the usual procedure ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "the dereddened colors of the subdwarfs were individually adjusted to compensate for the ( small ) differences in their metallicities relative to that of m13 using the isochrones of @xcite , as transformed to the strmgren  system using @xcite color  temperature relations . in the fit of the m13 @xmath28 and @xmath29 c - m diagrams to the resultant `` mono  metallicity '' subdwarf sequence , we used stars with @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the parallax , and photometric metallicities in the range @xmath32[fe / h]@xmath33 . consequently , the model - based color corrections are all quite small for these stars",
    ". furthermore , by adopting such stringent constraints on the relative parallax error , the lutz  kelker corrections ( @xcite ) amount to only a few hundredths of a magnitude , at most , and possible systematic biases for the whole sample are negligible as well ( see the discussion by pont et al .",
    "1998).km / s ) , while five out of six measurements of the velocity of hd 64090 by @xcite are in excellent agreement .",
    "@xcite quotes a semiamplitude limit of @xmath34km / s for their sensitivity , their one discrepant velocity value differs from the mean of the other five by @xmath35km / s .",
    "moreover , regardless of which c - m diagram is used in the subdwarf fit , these two stars show no sign of being `` overluminous '' with respect to the other two that we have used ( hd 34328 and hd 25329 ) and the ms fiducial . therefore , if hd 64090 and/or hd 188510 truly are binaries , the secondary component(s ) must be much fainter than the primaries .",
    "] we applied lutz ",
    "kelker corrections to the subdwarfs using the formula has no significant impact on the derived distance modulus . ] given by @xcite with @xmath36 .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the @xmath37 diagram for m13 with the subdwarfs overplotted .",
    "the main  sequence fit yields @xmath38 and @xmath39 with an uncertainty of @xmath40 mag .",
    "isochrones from @xcite for [ fe / h]@xmath41 , [ @xmath5/fe]@xmath42 , and ages of 10 , 12 , and 14 gyr have also been superposed on the data in fig .  1 .",
    "these indicate that the age of m13 is close to 12 gyr .",
    "the reduction in age from values near 1416 gyr that were commonly obtained a few years ago is due less to revisions in the cluster distance than to improvements in the stellar models .",
    "indeed , the m13 distance modulus derived here is within 0.1 mag of the values determined by e.g. , @xcite and @xcite in the pre  hipparcos  era .",
    "it is , instead , the use of improved opacities and an equation of state that treats non - ideal effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the adoption of a revised bolometric correction scale ( see @xcite ) , and the assumption of [ @xmath5/fe ] @xmath6 , instead of a scaled  solar heavy  element mix , that is primarily responsible for the reduced gc ages .",
    "it should be noted that the present models do not include the effects of helium diffusion , which can be expected to reduce the age at a given turnoff luminosity by @xmath43 gyr ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "having extensive strmgren  photometry for m13 stars fainter than the main  sequence turnoff allows us to determine whether the cluster differs significantly in age from field stars of similar metallicity . for f and g stars ,",
    "@xmath8  @xmath46@xmath17  @xmath47 is a measure of the size of the balmer jump , which , in turn , is a measure of surface gravity and hence of evolutionary state .",
    "therefore , the @xmath17  index can be used to distinguish between evolved and unevolved stars and to determine the ages of stars near the turnoff ( see , e.g. , fig .  7 in @xcite ) independently of any knowledge of their distances .",
    "this approach has been used by @xcite to determine ages for a large sample of metal  poor field stars . in figure 2",
    ", we have overplotted the photometry for stars in their catalogs having metallicities between @xmath48 and @xmath49 on the ( @xmath7  , @xmath8  ) diagram for m13 .",
    "it is immediately obvious from this figure that the field stars follow the cluster locus closely , indicating that the two stellar populations must have very nearly the same age .",
    "the maximum difference between the turnoff @xmath8  values is @xmath500025 , which translates into an age difference of @xmath51 gyr , which , we emphasize , is completely independent of the adopted distance scale .",
    "we can not , of course , exclude the possibility that some of the field stars on the lower main sequence are older , only that none of the evolved stars has a greater age than m13 .    a surprising feature of the data plotted in fig .",
    "2 is that , at any given @xmath7  color , the m13 giant - branch stars exhibit a large spread ( 01  015 ) in the @xmath8  index . as we have no spectra for the observed stars ,",
    "it is not clear at this point how these @xmath8  variations should be interpreted .",
    "however , as noted in  1 , it is well known that stars on the m13 rgb encompass large variations in the c , n , o , mg , and al abundances , most likely due to deep mixing during the post ",
    "main  sequence evolution . star  to  star variations in these elements are the most likely cause of the @xmath8  variations , in view of the fact that several investigations ( @xcite ) have demonstrated that stars with strong ch   and cn  bands can have significantly lower @xmath17  indices than similar stars of normal ch  and cn  strength .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the stars showing extreme @xmath17  values are needed to identify the elements responsible for the variations .",
    "if the large spread in the @xmath17  observations _ is _ due to variations in the elemental abundances due to mixing , then fig .",
    "2 would suggest that such mixing commences near the base of the red - giant branch .",
    "one can not help but speculate that a thermal instability in the h - burning shell might be at least partly responsible for the observed scatter since @xcite have shown that the greatest potential for such an instability occurs just as a star begins to ascend the giant branch .",
    "this possibility should be investigated further .",
    "we now turn to a brief discussion of the properties of the observed horizontal branch . in fig .  1 , a zahb locus ( vandenberg et al .  1998 ) , which represents the extension of the isochrones to the core he - burning phase , has been superposed on the data on the assumption of the adopted distance modulus and reddening .",
    "it is apparent that the coolest of the hb stars are reasonably well - matched by the model zahb .",
    "however , at @xmath52  @xmath53 , the hb stars appear to be @xmath54 `` overluminous '' compared to the theoretical locus .",
    "we note that this `` anomaly '' has also been seen by dorman et al .",
    "( 1998 , private communication ) in their _ hst _ observations of m13 ( using the @xmath55 and @xmath56 filters ) .",
    "in fact , a preliminary analysis of strmgren  data that we have in hand for ngc@xmath0288 and ngc@xmath06752 , which both possess blue hbs , show the same unexpected morphology . this can not be explained in terms of evolution away from a zahb since the evolution is slowest near the zero - age locus and most stars should , therefore , be found adjacent to it . unless the discrepancy is due to a problem with the color@xmath57 relations derived from model atmospheres , which seems unlikely , a different zahb must apply to these stars ; i.e. , m13 ( as well as ngc@xmath0288 and ngc@xmath06752 ) must possess at least two distinct hb populations .    at first sight",
    ", these observations appear to be in remarkable agreement with the recent predictions by sweigart ( 1997a , b ) , who has demonstrated that , if red - giants undergo sufficiently deep mixing as to modify their envelope helium abundances appreciably , then their decendants on the hb should be bluer and more luminous than predicted by canonical models .",
    "in fact , there is some indication in his calculations ( compare , e.g. , figs .  7 and 9 in sweigart 1997b ) that , for the hottest hb stars , the he - mixed models and those based on standard assumptions , will nearly coincide .",
    "thus , the near match of the canonical zahb with the lower - bound of the m13 stars fainter than @xmath58 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) can be understood . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have found that there is no apparent discrepancy between canonical hb models and m13 s hb when comparisons between the two are made on c - m diagrams involving bands that are bluer than the _ hst _ f336w filter ( which is close to the strmgren  @xmath11 ) .",
    "so , at the present moment , it is not clear how this will be resolved .",
    "finally , we note that in a @xmath59 diagram both the zahb appropriate to the coolest bhb stars and the locus of subgiant stars are very nearly horizontal and very well defined ; thus it is easy to measure the @xmath11 luminosity difference ( @xmath60 ) to high accuracy . from the isochrones of @xcite we estimate that @xmath60 changes at a rate of @xmath61 mag / gyr .",
    "given the high precision available here we estimate that this method will provide the possibility to measure the age difference between clusters of similar metallicity to better than 0.5@xmath0gyr .",
    "the capability of strmgren  photometry to reveal important new features of gc c - m diagrams is undeniable . in this investigation of m13",
    ", we have found that : 1 ) the reddening of m13 is @xmath2 , which corresponds to @xmath62 .",
    "2 ) the cluster distance is @xmath3 , based on c - m diagram fits to local subdwarfs with hipparcos  parallaxes .",
    "this implies an age of @xmath63 gyr according to recent theoretical isochrones for [ fe / h ] @xmath4 and [ @xmath5/fe ] @xmath6 ( but which do not take he diffusion into account ) .",
    "3 ) there is a large spread in @xmath17  for stars from the base to the tip of the rgb , which is probably indicative of star - to - star variations in the cno abundances .",
    "4 ) field stars with metallicities similar to that of m13 are found to be coeval with m13 to within @xmath64 gyr .",
    "5 ) the hb shows evidence for two distinct populations , which may be related to the observed scatter in @xmath17  on the rgb .",
    "it is also possible that we are seeing the signature of he mixing in upper rgb stars , as discussed by sweigart ( 1997a , b ) .",
