    "one of the many fascinating questions in the field of exoplanet studies is the search for habitable worlds . because of their relatively small mass , low luminosity , long lifetime and large abundance in the galaxy , m dwarfs",
    "are sometimes suggested as prime targets in searches for terrestrial habitable planets @xcite .",
    "the detection of planets with @xmath0 , i.e.  with a mass smaller than 10 terrestrial masses ( the upper limit for  super - earths  in the classification of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) recently became possible with current advances in instrumentation and analysis .",
    "the first super - earth detected was gj 876d , a planet with @xmath1 orbiting an m star @xcite .",
    "thereafter , other low - mass planets have been discovered : ogle-2005-blg-390 lb , a planet with @xmath2 in an orbit of 5 au was found by microlensing @xcite , and hd 69830b , a planet with a minimum mass of @xmath3 in an orbit of 0.08 au was detected by the radial velocity technique @xcite .",
    "more recently , two super - earth planets were discovered around the m3 dwarf gl 581 , with minimum masses of 5.0 @xmath4 and 7.7 @xmath4 , and semimajor axes of 0.07 and 0.25 au @xcite , and @xcite report the possible detection of a 5.0 @xmath4 planet around the m - type star gj 436 . in total ,",
    "6 planets with masses @xmath5 are known today , 5 of which are located in an orbit around an m star .",
    "the least massive planet has a mass of 5.0 @xmath4 .",
    "while the number of super - earth planets around m stars is currently still limited , the detection of cold debris disks around m stars seems to indicate that planets may be as frequent for m stars as they are for f , g and k stars @xcite .    for m stars the habitable zone ( defined by the range of orbital distances over which liquid water is possible on the planetary surface ,",
    "see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is much closer to the star ( depending on stellar mass , but typically @xmath60.3 au ) . such close - in distances pose additional problems and constraints to habitability .",
    "for example , there is the possibility that the atmosphere might collapse on the night side of the planet , although it seems that this problem is less severe than previously assumed @xcite .",
    "intense stellar flares are common , especially for young m stars , but the radiation can be shielded by the planetary atmosphere @xcite . both direct uv radiation @xcite and indirect uv radiation generated by energetic particles @xcite can have important consequences for biogenic processes on m - star planets .",
    "another potential problem for m star planet habitability is that one expects a large number of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) on active m stars .",
    "the related interaction of the dense cme plasma flux with the atmosphere / magnetosphere environment of the exposed planets during the active stage of the stellar evolution could be strong enough to erode the atmosphere or the planetary water inventory via non - thermal atmospheric loss processes @xcite .",
    "the efficient loss of water from the planet could also lead to a breakdown of plate tectonics . if the majority of the planets water is lost , the lithosphere will not be sufficiently deformable , and subduction of the crust can not occur .",
    "the recycling of the crust through plate tectonics keeps the crust thin .",
    "if the crust is too thick , the lithospheric plate comprising the crust will be too buoyant to be subducted .",
    "a thin crust and a wet planet seem to be very important for plate tectonics to operate .",
    "plate tectonics , however , help to cool the interior efficiently which is required to keep an earth - like thermally driven magnetic dynamo in operation over geological time spans @xcite . even in the case of m star planets with a magnetic dynamo ,",
    "the magnetic moment is not likely to be large .",
    "terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of m - stars can be expected to be tidally locked , which leads to a reduction in the planetary magnetic moment @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", one can assume that m - star planets within the habitable zones are only weakly protected by their magnetospheres , resulting in a higher cosmic ray exposure .",
    "in addition , the small orbital distances of these planets expose it to much denser stellar winds than at larger orbital distances .",
    "the dense stellar winds lead to a further compression of the magnetospheres , which can in principle again reduce the shielding efficiency against gcrs .    in this work",
    "we extend the studies of @xcite and @xcite by separately quantifying and comparing these two effects ( effect of enhanced stellar wind ram pressure due to the smaller orbital distance vs.  influence of a reduced planetary magnetic dipole moment ) .",
    "we show that the stellar wind variation with orbital distance has little influence on the shielding efficiency against galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the weak shielding found for m star planets @xcite thus has to be attributed to their reduced magnetic moment . given that the magnetic moment is the key parameter , we further analyse the influence of the planetary mass and its composition on the planetary magnetic moment , and thus on the cosmic ray shielding efficiency .    this paper is organised as follows :",

    "a planet with angular velocity @xmath7 at @xmath8 ( i.e.  after formation ) will gradually lose angular momentum , until the angular velocity reaches a constant value @xmath9 at @xmath10 . for a planet with a mass of @xmath11 and radius of @xmath12 around a star of mass @xmath13",

    "subsequently , the planets can be classified as either `` tidally locked '' , `` potentially tidally locked '' or `` unlocked '' .",

    "this can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyspectrum ] . as stated by @xcite , two effects can contribute to this high cosmic ray flux : ( a ) the reduced planetary magnetic dipole moment due to tidal locking ( section [ sec - magmoment ] ) and ( b ) the enhanced stellar wind ram pressure at small orbital distances ( section [ sec - stellarwind ] ) .",
    "however , if a solar mass star was used in case 3 , the planetary magnetosphere would be even more compressed , which does not decrease the cosmic ray flux .",
    "thus , the two other effects have to be responsible for the large difference in cosmic ray fluxes . ]",
    "contribute to the magnetospheric compression , which in turn determines the flux of high energy cosmic ray particles onto the planetary atmosphere .",
    "here , we compare the relative importance of these two effects .",
    "we first estimate the importance of the orbital distance via the stellar wind parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energylocking ] , we first compare the cosmic ray energy spectra of the two strongly magnetised cases ( with @xmath95 ) : the case of the earth ( case 2 , solid line ) and the hypothetical case of a strongly magnetised exoplanet ( case 4 , triangles ) .",
    "it can be seen that the cosmic ray energy spectra are identical at @xmath1001.0 au ( case 2 , solid line ) and at @xmath1000.2 au ( case 4 , triangles ) .",
    "we also compare the two weakly magnetised cases ( with @xmath96 ) : the weakly magnetised exoplanet case with @xmath1000.2 au ( case 3 , dashed line ) and the hypothetical case of the weakly magnetised earth at @xmath1001.0 au ( case 5 , circles ) . again , despite the large difference in orbital distance ( 0.2 and 1.0 au ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : energylocking ] shows that the cosmic ray energy spectrum is identical for these two cases .",
    "the distance - dependent stellar wind ram pressure does not seem to have any measurable influence on the cosmic ray energy spectrum .",
    "this may seem surprising , as it clearly has some influence on the size of the planetary magnetosphere , see table [ tab : rs : cosmicrays ] ( column 5 ) .",
    "however , table [ tab : rs : cosmicrays ] , column 6 shows that the magnetic field at the magnetopause is _ increased _ when the orbital distance of a planet is decreased while keeping the magnetic moment constant .",
    "this directly results from the pressure balance in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressureequilibrium ] ) .",
    "thus , when the orbital distance is decreased while the magnetic moment is kept fixed , the smaller size of the magnetosphere is compensated by a larger magnetic field at the magnetopause @xmath75 , which keeps the cosmic ray shielding at a constant level . in other words ,",
    "@xmath73 , the size of the planetary magnetosphere , is not a sufficient indicator for the quality of the magnetospheric shielding of a planetary atmosphere .    ]",
    "if the difference of the cosmic ray energy spectra between a locked exoplanet and the earth can not be explained by the different orbital distances , the discrepancy lies in magnetic moment differences .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the cosmic ray energy spectrum of the earth case ( case 2 , solid line ) to the cosmic ray flux of a hypothetical earth twin planet with a reduced magnetic moment ( case 5 , circles ) , with all other parameters kept constant ( @xmath101 au , @xmath91 ) .",
    "[ fig : energylocking ] shows that the energy spectrum is much higher in the weakly magnetised case ( @xmath96 , case 5 , circles ) than in the strongly magnetised case ( @xmath95 , case 2 , solid line ) .",
    "we also compare the two exoplanet cases ( @xmath102 au , @xmath94 ) , namely the `` locked exoplanet case '' ( case 3 , dashed line ) and the `` unlocked exoplanet case '' ( case 4 , triangles ) .",
    "again , it can be seen that the cosmic ray energy spectrum has much higher values for the weakly magnetised case than in the strongly magnetised case .",
    "obviously , the influence of tidal locking , hence the reduced magnetic moment ( and not the stellar wind ram pressure ) is the decisive factor for the increased influx of cosmic ray particles in case 3 ( when compared to case 2 ) .",
    "the similarity of cases 2 and 4 ( and of cases 3 and 5 ) also shows that protons of the chosen energy range mostly feel the planetary dipole field , and that the field of the magnetpause currents has little influence ( * ? ? ?",
    "similarly to a change in orbital distance , the planetary magnetic moment directly influences the size of the planetary magnetosphere ( see table [ tab : rs : cosmicrays ] , column 5 ) .",
    "when the magnetic moment is changed , however , the magnetic field strength at the magnetopause ( shown in table [ tab : rs : cosmicrays ] , column 6 ) does not differ ( compare cases 2 and 5 , and cases 3 and 4 , respectively ) .",
    "thus , when @xmath103const , the quality of the magnetospheric shielding of the planetary atmospheres depends on the size of the magnetosphere @xmath73 , i.e.  it is weaker for those planets with a smaller magnetosphere .    we conclude that , of the two effects suggested by @xcite , only one ( namely the effect of tidal locking ) has a measurable influence on the cosmic ray flux . the other effect ( stellar wind density variation with orbital distance )",
    "appears to have negligible influence .      for planets with different size or composition than the earth ,",
    "the planetary magnetic dipole moment and the size of the magnetosphere are different from the earth - like case .",
    "a few such cases are shown in table [ tab : rs : cosmicrays ] and discussed in this section .",
    "both `` super - earth '' cases ( cases 6 and 7 ) correspond to the case of a terrestrial planet with a composition similar to that of the earth , but with higher planetary masses ( 6 and 10 earth masses , respectively ) and correspondingly larger radii ( 1.63 and 1.86 earth radii , see the models of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for both cases , the expected magnetic moment ( table [ tab : rs : cosmicrays ] , column 4 ) is larger than for an earth - like planet ( case 3 ) .",
    "the larger magnetic moments lead to more extended magnetospheres ( table [ tab : rs : cosmicrays ] , column 5 ) . because the planetary radius is larger",
    ", however , the planetary atmosphere is located at a larger distance from the planetary centre , so that the protection from galactic cosmic rays should not be expected to be much more efficient than for an earth - like planet .",
    "figure [ fig : energy46ylo ] shows that this is indeed the case : the energy spectra of the `` locked exoplanet case '' ( case 3 , dashed line ) , of the `` small super - earth case '' ( case 6 , double - dashed line ) and of the `` large super - earth case '' ( case 7 , triple - dashed line ) are relatively similar .",
    "it can be seen that massive terrestrial planets do not necessarily have a much more efficient magnetospheric protection against galactic cosmic rays than an earth - mass planet .",
    "the `` ocean planet case '' ( case 8 , dotted line ) corresponds to a planet with a different composition : 17% metals , 33% silicates , and 50 % water ice ( this corresponds to the ocean planet modelled by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this change in composition reduces the average density when compared to the `` super - earth '' case of the same mass : the radius of a 6 earth - mass ocean planet is 2.0 earth radii ( as compared to the 1.63 earth radii used above ) .",
    "this moves the atmosphere further away from the centre of the protecting dipole .",
    "also , the reduced density leads to a somewhat reduced magnetic moment estimation .",
    "this is reflected in the small standoff distance measured in planetary radii ( see table [ tab : rs : cosmicrays ] ) when compared to the `` small super - earth case '' ( case 6 , double - dashed line ) , and the cosmic ray flux through the magnetosphere can be expected to be larger .",
    "these expectation is confirmed by the cosmic ray energy spectrum in figure [ fig : energy46ylo ] .",
    "more cosmic ray particles reach the atmosphere for the `` ocean planet case '' ( case 8 , dotted line ) than that of the `` small super - earth case '' ( case 6 , double - dashed lines ) .",
    "note that both planets have the same mass ( 6 @xmath4 ) , so that the difference is caused only by the difference in composition . for energies above 100 mev , the cosmic ray protection of an ocean planet (",
    "case 8) is weaker by a factor 2 - 3 than for a rocky planet of similar mass ( case 6 ) .",
    "we conclude that the planetary composition can be a potentially important factor concerning cosmic ray protection .    ]",
    "the increased flux of cosmic ray protons of galactic origin to the upper atmospheres of m - star planets has implications for the atmospheric composition and thus for the remote detection of biomarkers .",
    "it will also influence the flux of ( secondary ) cosmic ray particles reaching the ground , which can be expected to have biological implications .      in the near future",
    ", atmospheres of extrasolar planets will be studied from the point of view of possible biological activity . ``",
    "atmospheric biomarkers '' are compounds present in an atmosphere which imply the presence of life and which can not be explained by inorganic chemistry alone .",
    "the simultaneous presence of significant amounts of atmospheric reducing gases ( e.g. methane ) and oxidising gases ( e.g. oxygen ) as on the earth is also an indicator of biological activity @xcite .",
    "good biomarkers include oxygen ( produced by photosynthesis ) , ozone ( mainly produced from oxygen ) and nitrous oxide ( produced almost exclusively from bacteria ) .    for the study of biomarkers in planetary atmospheres ,",
    "it is important to know all inorganic effects which can modify the abundances of these molecules . modelling studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are required to rule out false conclusions in cases where inorganic chemistry can mimic the presence of life .",
    "@xcite looked at the response of biomarker chemistry on varying planetary parameters ( e.g. orbital distance , stellar type ) . here",
    ", we will discuss the response of biomarkers to cosmic rays .",
    "the influence of a high flux of gcrs to the atmospheres of planets in the habitable zone ( hz ) around m - stars was studied by @xcite . when cosmic rays travel through an earth - like atmosphere , they have sufficient energy to break the strong @xmath104 molecule and the chemical products react with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides ( @xmath105 )",
    ". if uv levels are intense , e.g. corresponding to the upper mesosphere and above on the earth , then the @xmath105 can not survive .",
    "@xmath105 affects biomarkers differently depending on altitude . in a tropospheric environment ,",
    "ozone is enhanced by @xmath105 due to the smog mechanism @xcite . in a stratospheric environment ,",
    "ozone is depleted by catalytic cycles @xcite .",
    "once ozone is affected , the other biomarkers can change too , because ozone affects the temperature profile ( hence e.g. mixing processes , chemical sources and sinks ) and uv levels ( hence photolysis rates ) of other chemical species .    using the cosmic ray spectra of our cases 1 , 2 and 3",
    ", it was shown that gcrs may enhance the production of @xmath105 by a factor of three , which may modify the abundances of biomarker molecules ( especially water and ozone ) by up to 25% @xcite .",
    "it thus seems that most biomarkers are not strongly influenced by galactic cosmic rays for earth - like planets in close orbits around m - stars .",
    "the case is different for solar energetic particles , which can strongly modify the abundance of ozone in the planetary atmosphere @xcite .",
    "such changes in atmospheric biomarker concentrations have to be taken into account when searching for biosignatures in the spectra of earth - like exoplanets @xcite by future space missions like darwin @xcite or see - coast @xcite .      while a quantitative treatment is not yet available , the increased flux of cosmic rays at the top of the planetary atmosphere has not only implications for atmospheric chemistry and biomarkers , but also for the flux of secondary radiation on the surface .",
    "when galactic cosmic rays of sufficiently high energy reach the planetary atmosphere , they generate showers of secondary cosmic rays . of the different components of such showers , slow neutrons",
    "have the strongest influence on biological systems .",
    "the propagation of high energy cosmic ray particles also depends on the composition and density of the planetary atmosphere . for an earth - like atmosphere ,",
    "the minimum energy which a proton must have to initiate a nuclear interaction that may be detectable at sea level is approximately 450 mev @xcite .",
    "terrestrial planets with dense atmospheres like venus ( 100 bar surface pressure ) would be better shielded by the planetary atmosphere , so that no secondary radiation can reach the surface . on the other hand , for planets with thin atmospheres like mars ( 6 mbar surface pressure )",
    ", the surface would probably be totally sterilised , even for a relatively low cosmic ray flux .    keeping the atmospheric pressure constant at @xmath1061 bar , the flux at energies @xmath107 mev",
    "is strongly increased for the planetary situations presented in section [ sec - results ] ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : energylocking ] and [ fig : energy46ylo ] ) , and a large increase of secondary cosmic rays can be expected at the planetary surface .",
    "biological effects , namely an increase in cell fusion indices for different cell - lines , were found to be significantly correlated with the neutron count rate at the earth s",
    "surface @xcite .",
    "similar , but much stronger and more diverse effects were observed during large solar particle events , where solar cosmic rays dominate over galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the effect of cosmic rays on cells and on dna are potentially hazardous for life . on the other hand ,",
    "changes at the genetic level are a necessary condition for biological evolution , so that cosmic rays may also play a role in radiation - induced evolutionary events .    as tidally",
    "locked earth - like exoplanets inside the hz of low - mass k / high - mass m stars are only weakly protected against high energetic cosmic rays , they can be expected to experience a higher surface neutron flux and stronger biological effects than earth - like planets with a strong magnetic moment .",
    "for this reason , it may be more difficult for life to develop on the surface of planets around such stars .",
    "it was also shown ( section [ sec - type ] ) that larger planets ( super - earths ) are not much better protected against gcrs than smaller planets .",
    "the atmospheres of extrasolar planets with orbits in the habitable zone of m stars are exposed to high fluxes of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "we have studied the effect of orbital distance via the stellar wind parameters , tidal locking , planetary mass and planetary composition on the cosmic ray fluxes . in previous works ,",
    "the weak shielding found for m star planets was attributed to a combination of the enhanced stellar wind ram pressure with the reduced planetary magnetic dipole moment @xcite . here",
    ", we have shown that the variable stellar wind density at different orbital distance ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 au ( i.e. the chz of star with @xmath108 )",
    ". has little influence on the gcr flux .",
    "the planetary magnetic moment is the decisive parameter : tidally locked planets with a small magnetic moment have much higher particle fluxes than freely rotating planets with stronger magnetic moments .      generally speaking , to determine the magnetospheric shielding of a planetary atmosphere , it is not sufficient to calculate @xmath73 , the size of the planetary magnetosphere , but one has also to take into account @xmath75 , the magnetic field at the magnetopause .",
    "the above factors have to be considered for missions studying biosignatures in the spectra of earth - like exoplanets for two reasons : the enhanced flux of galactic cosmic rays may naturally generate or destroy molecules typically regarded as biomarkers @xcite , which has to be taken into account in the analysis and interpretation of such spectra .",
    "also , as the habitability of m star planets may be affected , future observation campaigns should ensure that enough non - m stars are in the sample to maximise the likelihood of a positive detection .",

    "<S> previous studies have shown that extrasolar earth - like planets in close - in habitable zones around m - stars are weakly protected against galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) , leading to a strongly increased particle flux to the top of the planetary atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> two main effects were held responsible for the weak shielding of such an exoplanet : ( a ) for a close - in planet , the planetary magnetic moment is strongly reduced by tidal locking . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , such a close - in extrasolar planet is not protected by an extended magnetosphere . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the small orbital distance of the planet exposes it to a much denser stellar wind than that prevailing at larger orbital distances . </S>",
    "<S> this dense stellar wind leads to additional compression of the magnetosphere , which can further reduce the shielding efficiency against gcrs . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we analyse and compare the effect of ( a ) and ( b ) , showing that the stellar wind variation with orbital distance has little influence on the cosmic ray shielding . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the weak shielding of m star planets can be attributed to their small magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> we further analyse how the planetary mass and composition influence the planetary magnetic moment , and thus modify the cosmic ray shielding efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we show that more massive planets are not necessarily better protected against galactic cosmic rays , but that the planetary bulk composition can play an important role .    ,    ,    ,    ,    extrasolar planets , cosmic rays , magnetospheres </S>"
