    "we have also published our first catalogue of newly identified lmc emission line stars ( reid & parker , 2012 ) .",
    "we later modified the pn numbers to 411 new and 164 previously known pne with the aid of further spectroscopic follow - up and the commencement of multi - wavelength and emission - line ratio comparisons ( reid & parker 2010 ) .",
    "such comparisons offer additional diagnostic capability to weed out contaminating pn mimics as shown by frew & parker ( 2010 ) and sabin et al .",

    "we have now extended our survey to cover 40deg@xmath1 of the outer lmc beyond our original central 25deg@xmath1 field using the 64deg@xmath1 coverage given by the magellanic cloud emission - line survey ( mcels )  .",
    "in addition we have access to the higher resolution single exposure anglo - australian observatory / uk schmidt telescope ( aao / ukst ) h@xmath2 and short red band ` sr ' survey fields that completely overlap with the extended mcels region .",
    "these wide - field images were exposed between 1997 and 2001 using tech - pan film on the ukst for eventual inclusion in the on - line supercosmos r and h@xmath2 sky surveys .",
    "the digitised pixel size is 10 micron ( 0.67 arcsec ) and is provided in density units , scaled to maximize the range of 16-bit integers per pixel provided the supercomsos .",
    "this additional digital data covering the magellanic clouds and magellanic stream is not currently available on line but our access to it has enabled us to verify , at higher angular resolution , many of the new candidate mcels objects as genuine emission sources .",
    "these candidates were followed up spectroscopically using aaomega on the aat , 6df on the ukst and the 1.9 m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "the resulting reduced spectra were then measured and examined to determine the strength of key emission lines and ratios such as [ nii]/h@xmath2 , [ oiii]5007 / h@xmath4 and heii4686 / h@xmath4",
    "as described in reid & parker ( 2006a , b ) .",
    "once strong candidates were found , they were examined using false colour images from the @xmath5 sage survey ( surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution ) ( meixner et al .",
    "2006 ) and 2mass ( skrutskie et al . 2006 ) ( for bright candidates ) in order to determine the infrared excess .",
    "the combination of these spectroscopic criteria and multi - wavelength images have allowed us to confidently assess and classify pn candidates as necessary .",
    "additional candidate source photometry was also gained from the magellanic cloud photometric survey ( mcps ) ( zaritsky et al . 2004 ) depending on coverage and magnitude limits .",
    "a combination of all of the above photometric and spectroscopic data has allowed us to decisively extend our pn survey to the sparser outer regions of the lmc and provide firmer probability ratings as to the true nature of the emission sources presented in this paper .",

    "the mcels survey was designed to identify and study the interstellar medium ( ism ) within the magellanic clouds as well as discrete emission objects such as hii  regions , supernova remnants , planetary nebulae , superbubbles and giant shells .",
    "it was intended that it be used as a foundation and applied together with other multi - wavelength surveys and observations ( smith et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the survey employed large - format ccd detectors on the schmidt telescope at ctio to create uniform data sets which imaged the central 8 @xmath6 8deg@xmath1 of the lmc and the central 3.5deg @xmath6 4.5deg@xmath1 of the smc .",
    "this produced 3 arcsec / pixel data with a resolution of @xmath05 arcsec .",
    "individual exposures covered a 1.1deg @xmath6 1.1 field of view .",
    "areas were sampled an average of eight times in four different regions of the detector to assist in eliminating flat fielding and other instrumental effects .",
    "exposures were taken using custom - made 4-inch interference filters centred on h@xmath2  ( @xmath76563 , @xmath8 = 30 ) , [ sii ]  ( @xmath76724 , @xmath8 = 50 ) and [ oiii ]  ( @xmath75007 , @xmath8 = 40 ) .",
    "continuum - band filters at @xmath76850 , @xmath8 = 95  and @xmath75130 , @xmath8 = 155were also obtained to allow subtraction of stellar sources .",
    "the aao / ukst h@xmath2 survey ( 1998 - 2003 ) used the world s largest monolithic narrow - band h@xmath2 interference filter ( parker & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) with a 70  full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) bandpass ( so actually a h@xmath2 plus [ nii]6548 , 6584  filter ) .",
    "it was the last , great ukst survey , the only one to be taken on kodak technical pan film rather than glass plates ( parker & malin 1999 ) and the only one to be available to the community solely in digital form .",
    "the main survey covered 4500deg@xmath1 of the southern galactic plane ( parker et al . 2005 ) and has led to a wealth of pn discoveries in its own right ( e.g. parker et al .",
    "2006 , miszalski et al .",
    "however , at the same time , a little known h@xmath2 survey of 40 ukst fields in and around the magellanic clouds ( including the bridge and stream ) was also undertaken by parker & morgan .",
    "this was in addition to their multi - exposure ( 12 h@xmath2 and six sr ) deep stack over the central ukst field of the lmc as already reported ( reid & parker 2006a , b ) .",
    "we have special access to the 40 field aao / ukst lmc and smc h@xmath2 survey which includes matching short red exposures .",
    "in this work it has been used extensively to confirm emission source candidates uncovered by mcels .",
    "however , it can also be used for emission line source candidate selection outside the 64deg@xmath1 area covered by the mcels survey and as such will form the basis of a future investigation by our team .",
    "the supercosmos lmc h@xmath2 map has proved particularly useful in cases where bad pixels in the mcels maps often resembled point emission sources . the 5 rayleigh sensitivity and arcsec spatial resolution of the ukst based magellanic cloud h@xmath2 survey meant that these data were able to provide some vital morphological information to assist our source selection criteria and spectroscopic target prioritization .      candidate emission sources were selected from the mcels maps by assigning a false rgb colour to each of the three narrow - band filters and merging them into one colour map .",
    "we then searched the combined colour map for sources that indicated high [ oiii]@xmath75007@xmath9 and h@xmath2 signatures .",
    "candidate pn sources were those that ( in terms of their colours ) fell within these two bands and which are expected to comply with expectations for lmc pne in low extinction , low metallicity environments .",
    "for example , by assigning red to h@xmath2 , green to [ oiii ]  and blue to [ sii ] , all bright pne appear as yellow - brown / green sources since yellow is a mixture of red and green .",
    "normal , continuum sources ( stars ) appear with colours varying between blue , white and red , providing a clear differentiation between them and potential emission objects .",
    "examples of previously known and newly identified lmc pn uncovered in this way are given in figs  [ figure1 ] and  [ figure2 ] respectively .",
    "this mcels pn candidate recognition process was significantly aided by assessing the new candidate pne with respect to the appearance of known pne using the same merged colour identification technique .",
    "the identification and initial assessment was supplemented by our special access to supercosmos multi - exposure h@xmath2/sr exposure images covering the regions outside the original 25deg@xmath1 lmc region .",
    "this somewhat manual method of object detection using both mcels and supercosmos merged colour imaging proved to be more effective , allowing better discrimination than the method provided by the standard daophot and sextractor software packages .",
    "these packages are especially good at finding faint galaxies through a process called segmentation , which identifies regions which differ in brightness , colour , texture or can be delineated by edges . in short ,",
    "these packages use two images to look for a combination of fluxes which are different to other objects .",
    "since pne can be very bright or faint in the [ oiii]5007  and the ( h@xmath2 + [ nii ] )  bands with a variety of ratios between the two and widely differing strengths of [ sii ] , there is an extremely wide variation in possible colour combinations . with the low resolution of the mcles maps",
    "where most pne occupied only 2 - 4 pixels , it proved more efficient to train the eye to detect both bright and faint candidates dominated by either [ oiii ]  or [ nii ] .",
    "this allowed us to include all candidates to the faintest detectable limits of the survey ( [ oiii]= 1.4@xmath6 10@xmath10 erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 arcsec@xmath13 ; h@xmath2= 7.0@xmath6 10@xmath14 erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 arcsec@xmath13 ; [ sii]= 5.2@xmath6 10@xmath14 erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 arcsec@xmath13 , in agreement with pellegrini et al .",

    "this is because the survey does not go as deep for point source detection in the three bands as our central h@xmath2 arcsecond resolution median - stacked data and because mcels has poorer angular resolution ( @xmath05arcsec ) , with pixels as large as 3  arcsec on the sky .",
    "this means that , in many cases , faint pne in the lmc mcels data are not much larger than 1 pixel across .",
    "although the survey aimed to reach a limiting surface brightness of approximately 3 @xmath6 10@xmath10 erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 arcsec@xmath13 ( smith et al . 1999 ) , the low resolution means that any point sources near that level are impossible to define .",

    "these data allowed us to not only confirm the emission sources but check relative band strengths , where coloured and merged bands often result in specific combinations which are typical of pne whose multi - wavelength characteristics and emission lines betray their presence in these passbands ( e.g. see parker et al .",

    "these survey fields , which are not yet generally released nor in the public domain , were each assigned a distinguishing colour and merged to reveal the h@xmath2 excess in exactly the same way as originally reported in reid & parker ( 2006a ) for the ukst deep median stack data .",
    "furthermore , the higher resolution of @xmath01 - 1.5  arcsec of the ukst h@xmath2 data ( with 0.67  arcsecond supercosmos pixels ) provides improved resolution , crucial for indicating the presence of any faint extensions such as jets and possible agb haloes as well as very faint , compact yet resolved nebulae .",

    "the robust fit is especially important when dealing with faint objects .",
    "the sky fibre spectra in the data were then combined and subtracted from each fibre .",
    "it is normal for cosmic rays to be rejected automatically during the reduction process as each 2df field observed usually has a minimum of two exposures which permit efficient rejection routines to be employed .",

    "these high excitation and likely typei ( peimbert 1978 ) pne were found at scattered locations across the outer lmc and represent 30@xmath32 of the newly discovered pne .",
    "optical spectra of the remaining candidates were assessed on the basis of [ oiii]/h@xmath4 ratio where [ oiii]4959 / h@xmath4 @xmath223 are more likely to be pne . for each nebulae , however , an individual assessment must be made where [ oiii ] , [ oii ] , [ nii ] , [ sii ] , heii , ne , ar , and the balmer lines are all measured and used for spectral classification .",
    "these spectral classifications are conducted hand - in - hand with available optical images using h@xmath2 , sr , [ sii ]  and [ oiii ]  bands in order to exclude possible compact hii  regions and assess the local environment .",
    "this also allowed us to exclude faint objects which were possibly dominated by ambient emission and other sources of contamination .",
    "it is worth noting that in the absence of @xmath21 imaging , morphological information on lmc pne is difficult to extract from ground - based data .",
    "the best pn candidates were then assessed using the 2mass @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 bands and sage ( meixner et al .",
    "2006 ) , @xmath36  mir maps as described below .",
    "the final step was to use the emission line ratio diagnostic plots first introduced by sabbadin et al .",

    "contamination by the many types of possible pn mimics may adversely affect the true form of the pnlf .",
    "this is particularly important at the bright end whose truncated exponential fit is used as an extragalactic distance indicator ( ciardullo et al , 2002 ; reid & parker 2010 ) .      a combined multi - wavelength and spectral analysis is a very complete and robust method of assessing the veracity of pne .",
    "it is clear , however , that an optical spectrum and high resolution , deep optical image are the best starting point for the identification of a pn .",
    "it is additionally helpful to examine the nir bands using 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 , cutri et al . , 2003 ) or the new vista magellanic cloud ( vmc survey ; cioni et al , 2011 ) @xmath38 , @xmath33 and @xmath35@xmath39 colours in order to identify the increased reddening , expected in most pne . sage ( meixner et al . 2006 ) observations in the mir provide much needed information regarding the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , dust and other thermal emissions which help to separate pne from emission - line stars and hii  regions . indeed , parker et al ( 2012 ) have recently shown it is possible to identify high - quality pn candidates purely on the basis of their mir characteristics .",
    "the brighter pne candidates in the new lmc sample were crosschecked against 2mass nir images and photometric data at @xmath33(1.25@xmath40 m ) , @xmath34(1.65@xmath40 m ) and @xmath35@xmath39(2.16@xmath40 m ) band - passes in order to identify and separate bright stellar sources and large emission objects from pne .",

    "the individual results of this multi - wavelength analysis , covering the whole lmc ( as well as these newly identified candidates in the outer lmc ) is presented in the sister paper to this one ( reid & parker , 2013 ) .",
    "in addition to an analysis of the false colour images , constructed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) covering @xmath42 to 24@xmath40 m allowed us to compare our newly identified pn candidates with previously known pne in the outer lmc .",

    "the seds were constructed using raw data , uncorrected for extinction .",
    "we first constructed a comparison plot of seds for pn mimics in the lmc in order to compare the shape of their seds with that of pne .",
    "such plots can assist in identifying non - pne since emission nebulae containing dust components , emission lines and a central stellar source create a characteristic shape .",
    "other objects compared include compact hii  regions , compact bubbles which may be part of a snr , symbiotic stars , eclipsing binaries , wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , emission - line stars , young stellar objects ( ysos ) , late - type stars and ordinary field stars .",
    "each object type from the lmc was averaged with the resulting mean for each bandpass shown in figs .  [ figure5 ] and  [ figure6 ] .",
    "the average sed for lmc pne includes all 715 known and new pne , including those presented here for the first time , and represents the true mean flux for lmc pne at each band .",
    "error bars show the standard deviations found for pne , since they are of principal interest .",
    "similarity in the overall shape of seds for various emission sources has led to pn mimics being included in pn catalogues over past decades ( see frew & parker 2010 ) .",
    "[ figure5 ] compares the averaged seds for pne against those derived for hii  regions , emission - line stars and ysos , the objects most commonly mistaken for pne .",
    "all mean object types have been normalized to the mean i - band magnitude of 18.85 for lmc pne .",
    "although similar , there are some interesting differences in these seds that can assist in identification .",
    "ysos show the greatest luminosity range from the optical to the mir .",
    "they increase with particular strength through the nir region , almost forming a straight line from @xmath43 to 24@xmath40 m .",
    "in contrast , hii  regions show a somewhat flat sed extending from @xmath18 across to @xmath35 in the nir . after a rise to the mir they are also rather flat until 8@xmath40 m , where they brighten by an average 4 mag .",
    "emission - line stars follow the seds of hii  regions closely until 8@xmath40 m , after which a clear lack of pahs means they only continue a gradual rise driven by dust continuum .",
    "only five emission - line stars in our sample of the 970 with irac data have a published flux at the 24@xmath40 m band .",
    "this is the result of both the sensitivity cut - off for spitzer mips in the lmc and a general lack of available mips cross - matched data .",
    "the sed transition from 8@xmath40 m to 24@xmath40 m should therefore be accepted with some caution as it may only represent the brightest emission - line stars in the lmc .",
    "the subtle differences between the seds of these objects and pne can be of enormous benefit when low resolution optical spectra are inconclusive .    in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] we show the mean seds of several object types that are less often confused with pne due to strong emission - line characteristics in the optical . in terms of their seds , the closest counterparts to pne are the wr stars and symbiotic stars . wr stars are brighter in @xmath43 due to a strong ionized helium component .",
    "symbiotic stars increase in luminosity red - ward from @xmath43 , presumably due to the interaction of a late - type stellar companion .",
    "late - type stars have the largest deviation , also extending to brighter magnitudes in the nir than any other object types .",
    "although these cool stars resemble pne in h@xmath2/red subtracted images , an optical spectrum can instantly identify these stars due to the rising red continuum and tio bands .",
    "since all the plotted objects are located in the lmc at the same average distance , we can directly compare mean luminosity levels .",
    "pne have an optical luminosity that is on average comparable to field stars , ysos and snrs .",
    "late - type stars and symbiotic stars have comparable luminosities to pne only in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 bands .",
    "their luminosities increase substantially through the @xmath43 and @xmath18 bands to become the brightest sources to be found in the nir .",
    "unlike pne , however , they do not experience a substantial rise in luminosity through the mir , indicating a low dust and molecular content .",
    "although the seds of pne also rise towards the nir , the rise is more modest , placing them among the faintest of objects across the nir bands .",
    "pne gain in luminosity across the mir , somewhat matching the rise experienced by wr stars and hii  regions , although the later may experience more irregular variations depending on the mass , density and ionizing source of the gas .",
    "those objects , brightest at optical wavelengths such as emission - line stars , wr stars , eclipsing binaries and hii  regions may experience a slight decrease in luminosity towards the @xmath18 band but in most cases will experience a modest rise across the nir and into the mir . within the mir they each experience a rise , notably with wr stars increasing substantially between 4.5 and 5.8@xmath40 m and hii  regions doing the same between 5.8 and 8@xmath40 m .",
    "although all of these seds are quite similar there are key differences at certain wavelengths and so they can be of some use in weeding out , or at least identifying , suspicious pn candidates .    the plots , shown in fig .  [ figure7 ] for the previously known pne in the outer lmc and fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] for the newly identified pne in the same outer regions provide an additional certainty as to the new classification of these objects . at this stage the plots are shown in order to verify and compare the general trends for lmc pne rather than assess individual objects .",
    "for that reason we have not identified pne that show somewhat unusual behaviour .    in both plots",
    "the pne seds can be defined as showing an almost flat or downward slope from the blue towards the @xmath28  band followed by a steady rise towards 24@xmath40 m .",
    "a noticeable rise in the seds for previously known pne around the @xmath18  band shows the strength of the [ oiii ]  emission lines in these brighter objects compared to the more highly evolved and fainter pne found in our new sample which are generally stronger in their [ nii ]  emission . the steady rise in the seds of both previously known and newly discovered pne is evidence that the cool , warm , and hot dust has an equal effect on the seds both while pne are young and when they are optically faint and evolved .",
    "presumably atomic and molecular emission lines will still be present at some level in the faint pne .",
    "a number of pne show some variation in the seds moving from the @xmath28-band up to 8@xmath40 m but this may be due to either variations in the relative strengths of the stellar continuum affecting the warm dust emission , scattered light around the nir , h@xmath44 emission , unusual variations in the pah emission at 5.8 and 8@xmath40 m and/or forbidden line emission from ionised gas at discrete wavelengths that could affect band strengths .",
    "such an example is the mir [ oiv ]  emission line which is a proxy for the heii  line in the optical and so arises within high excitation pne .",
    "where data are available , we find that all the pne show a rise between 8 and 24@xmath40 m , indicating a central star that is hot enough to produce a warm dust component .",
    "one issue for 2mass data in the lmc is its sensitivity cutoff .",
    "although the 2mass sensitivity at s / n = 10 is already reached at 15.8 , 15.1 and 14.3 mag for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath45 respectively , some strong emission lines which often dominate these bands in pne can still be detected in the lmc sample .",
    "the brightest in the @xmath33 band is paschen @xmath4 although a spectrum will also reveal the presence of hei , [ feii ]  and [ oi ] .",
    "the @xmath34 band can be dominated by the brackett series with hei1.7002@xmath40 m and occasionally [ feii]1.6440@xmath40 m .",
    "the brightest line in the @xmath45 band is brackett @xmath46 with hei2.058 , 2.112@xmath40 m . although it is useful to know that these lines may be present , we know that they may be almost missing in young pne where a strong warm dust continuum may dominate ( hora et al , 1999 ) . fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] shows us that these lines are also likely to be either missing or below the detection limit in highly evolved pne which include most of the newly discovered pne in our sample .      with reliable flux calibration of the lmc pn observational data covering almost every pn in the lmc ,",
    "basic diagnostic plots provide an overall snapshot of line characteristics and ratios .",
    "these plots can be useful for identifying pn mimics ( frew & parker 2010 ) .",
    "however , considerable overlap between the regions occupied by pne , hii  regions , symbiotic stars , wr stars , snrs , agns and emission - line stars of various types means that the identification of suspicious , outlying objects will have to be referred back to earlier forms of identification . in other words",
