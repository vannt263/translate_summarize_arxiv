    "dynamical phenomena is an important topic in statistical physics .",
    "physical quantities in self organized and/or driven systems show rich time dependent behaviour in many cases .",
    "some of the dynamical phenomena which have attracted a lot of attention are critical dynamics , quenching and coarsening , reaction diffusion systems , random walks etc .    in most of these phenomena ,",
    "we find there is a single timescale leading to uniform time dependent behaviour which in many cases is a power law decay or growth @xcite . however , in some complex systems , it has been observed that the dynamics is governed by a distinct short time behaviour followed by a different behavior at long times .",
    "for example , in spin systems , at criticality , the order parameter is observed to grow for a macroscopically short time @xcite while at longer times it decays in an expected power law manner . for correlated random walks ,",
    "e.g. , the persistent random walk on the other hand , one finds a ballistic ( i.e. , when the root mean square ( rms ) displacement scales linearly with time ) to diffusive ( rms displacement varying as the square root of time ) crossover in the dynamics @xcite .",
    "random walks on small world networks show a completely opposite behaviour , the number of distinct sites visited by the walker has an initial diffusive scaling followed by a ballistic variation with time @xcite .",
    "this is also true for a biased random walker .    in this paper",
    ", we study a dynamical model of ising spins in one dimension which is governed by a single parameter .",
    "the system is a generalised version of a recently proposed model in @xcite ( which we refer to as model i henceforth ) where the state of the spins ( @xmath12 ) may change in two situations : first when its two neighbouring domains have opposite polarity , and in this case the spin orients itself along the spins of the neighbouring domain with the larger size .",
    "this case may arise only when the spin is at the boundary of the two domains .",
    "the neighbouring domain sizes are calculated excluding the spin itself , however , even if it is included , there is no change in the results .",
    "a spin is also flipped when it is sandwiched between two domains of spins with same sign .",
    "when the two neighbouring domains of the spin are of the same size but have opposite polarity , the spin will change its orientation with fifty percent probability . except for this rare event",
    "the dynamics in the above model is deterministic .",
    "this dynamics leads to a homogeneous state of either all spins up or all spins down . such evolution to absorbing homogeneous states are known to occur in systems belonging to directed percolation ( dp ) processes , zero temperature ising model , voter model etc . @xcite .",
    "model i was introduced in the context of a social system where the binary opinions of individuals are represented by up and down spin states . in opinion dynamics models ,",
    "such representation of opinions by ising or potts spins is quite common @xcite .",
    "the key feature is the interaction of the individuals which may lead to phase transitions between a homogeneous state to a heterogeneous state in many cases @xcite .    model i showed the existence of novel dynamical behaviour in a coarsening process when compared to the dynamical behaviour of dp processes , voter model , ising models etc . @xcite .",
    "the domain sizes were observed to grow as @xmath13 with the exponent @xmath14 very close to unity . it may be noted that the dynamics of a domain wall can be visualised as the movement of a walker and therefore the value @xmath15 indicated that the effective walks are ballistic . when stochasticity is introduced in this model , such that spin flips are dictated by a so called `` temperature '' factor",
    ", it shows a robust behaviour in the sense that only for the temperature going to infinity there is conventional ising model like behaviour with @xmath6 , i.e. , the domain wall dynamics becomes diffusive in nature @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we have introduced the parameter @xmath0 , which we call the cutoff factor , such that the maximum size of the neighbouring domains a spin can sense is given by @xmath1 in a one dimensional system of @xmath2 spins with periodic boundary condition . it may be noted that for @xmath7 , we recover the original model i where there is effectively no restriction on the size sensitivity of the spins .",
    "@xmath16 corresponds to the nearest neighbour ising model where @xmath17 in the thermodynamic limit .    by the introduction of the parameter @xmath0",
    "we have essentially defined a restricted neighbourhood of influence on a spin .",
    "thus here we have a finite neighbourhood to be considered , which is like having a model with finite long range interaction .",
    "in addition , here we impose the condition that within this restricted neighbourhood , the domain structure is also important in the same way it was in model i. if one considers opinion dynamics systems ( by which model i was originally inspired ) , the domain sizes represent some kind of social pressure . a finite cutoff ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) puts a restriction on the domain sizes which may correspond to geographical , political , cultural boundaries etc .",
    "the case with uniform cutoff signifies that all the individuals have same kind of restriction ; we have also considered the case with random cutoffs which is perhaps closer to reality .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the dynamical rule and quantities estimated .",
    "we present the results for the case when @xmath0 is same for all spins in section iii and iv and in section v we consider the case when the values of @xmath0 for each spin is random , lying between zero and unity and constant over time for each spin . in the last section , we end with concluding remarks .",
    "as mentioned before , only the spins at the boundary of a domain wall can change its state .",
    "when sandwiched between two domains of same sign , it will be always flipped . on the other hand , for other boundary spins (",
    "termed the target spins henceforth ) , there will be two neighbouring domains of opposite signs .",
    "for such spins , we have the following dynamical scheme : let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be the sizes of the two neighbouring domains of type up and down of a target spin ( excluding itself ) . in model",
    "i , the dynamical rule was like this : if @xmath19 is greater ( less ) than @xmath20 , the target spin will be up ( down ) and if @xmath21 the target spin is flipped with probability 0.5 .",
    "now , with the introduction of @xmath0 , the definition of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are modified : @xmath22 and similarly @xmath23 while the same dynamical rule applies .",
    "as far as dynamics is concerned , we investigate primarily the time dependent behaviour of the order parameter , fraction of domain walls and the persistence probability .",
    "the order parameter is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of up ( down ) spins in the system and @xmath26 , the total number of spins .",
    "this is identical to the ( absolute value of ) magnetisation in the ising model .    the average fraction of domain walls @xmath27 , which is the average number of domain walls divided by the system size @xmath2 is identical to the inverse of average domain size .",
    "hence the dynamical evolution of the order parameter and fraction of domain walls is expected to be governed by the dynamical exponent @xmath14 ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the persistence probability @xmath30 of a spin is the probability that it remains in its original state up to time @xmath4 @xcite is also estimated .",
    "@xmath30 has been shown to have a power law decay in many systems with an associated exponent @xmath31 .",
    "the persistence probability , in finite systems has been shown to obey the following scaling form @xcite @xmath32 the exponent @xmath33 is associated with the saturation value of the persistence probability at @xmath34 when @xmath35 @xcite .    in the simulations",
    ", we have generated systems of size @xmath36 with a minimum of 2000 initial configurations for the maximum size in general .",
    "depending on the system size and time to equilibriate , maximum iteration times have been set .",
    "random updating process has been used to control the spin flips . in general",
    ", the error bars in the data are less than the size of the data points in the figures and therefore not shown .",
    "in this section , we discuss the case when @xmath37 is finite .",
    "effectively this means that @xmath37 does not scale with @xmath2 and is kept a constant for all system sizes .",
    "since @xmath37 is kept finite , expressing @xmath38 implies @xmath3 in the the thermodynamic limit . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the model is same as the ising model as the dynamical rule is identical to the zero temperature glauber dynamics .",
    "but it may be noted that making @xmath39 will make the dynamical rules different from the case of @xmath16 ; as an example we show in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] how making @xmath40 or @xmath41 changes the dynamical rule compared to @xmath16 .",
    "[ ht ]    [ ht ]    we have simulated systems with @xmath40 and @xmath42 which show that the dynamics leads to the equilibrium configuration of all spins up / down .",
    "not only that , the dynamic exponents also turn out to be identical to those corresponding to the nearest neighbour ising values ( i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "as @xmath37 is increased , the finite size effects become stronger , however , it is indicated that the ising exponents will prevail as the system size becomes larger . in an indirect way , we have shown later that @xmath6 as @xmath45 using a general scaling argument .",
    "the behaviour of the different dynamic quantities for @xmath42 are shown in figs [ domainmagr3 ] and [ persr3 ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss the case when @xmath0 is finite .",
    "we also assume that @xmath0 is uniform , which means each spin experiences the same cutoff .",
    "the equilibrium behavior is same for all @xmath0 , i.e. , starting from a random initial configuration , the dynamics again leads to a final state with @xmath47 , i.e. , all spins up or all spins down . for @xmath7 ,",
    "that is in model i , it was numerically obtained that @xmath48 and @xmath49 giving @xmath50 , while in the one dimensional ising model @xmath43 and @xmath51 ( exact results ) giving @xmath52 .",
    "it is clearly indicated that though model i and the ising model have identical equilibrium behaviour , they belong to two different dynamical classes which correspond to @xmath53 and @xmath3 limit respectively of the present model .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate the dynamics in the intermediate range of @xmath0 .",
    "[ ht ]    drastic changes in the dynamics are noted for finite values of @xmath55 .",
    "the behaviour of all the three quantities , @xmath56 , @xmath27 and @xmath30 shows the common feature of a power law growth or decay with time up to an initial time @xmath10 which increases with @xmath0 .",
    "the power law behaviour is followed by a very slow variation of the quantities over a much longer interval of time , before they attain the equilibrium values .",
    "the power law behaviour in the early time occur with exponents consistent with model i , i.e. , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this early time behaviour accompanied by model i exponents is easy to explain : it occurs while the domain sizes are less than @xmath59 such that the size sensitivity does not matter and the dynamics is identical to that in model i. as the domain size increase beyond this value , the sizes of the neighbouring domains as sensed by the boundary spin become equal making the dynamics stochastic rather than deterministic as a result of which the dynamics becomes much slower .",
    "[ ht ]    we thus argue that since domain size @xmath60 , the time up to which model i behaviour will be observed is @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath14 for model i is @xmath62 we expect that @xmath63 . for a fixed size @xmath2 one",
    "can then consider the scaled time variable @xmath64 , and plot the relevant scaled quantities against @xmath65 for different values of @xmath0 to get a data collapse up to @xmath66 , independent of @xmath0 .",
    "we indeed observe this , in figures [ magcolp ] , [ domaincolp ] and [ percolp ] , the scaling plots as well as the raw data are shown . from the raw data ,",
    "@xmath10 is clearly seen to be different for different @xmath0 .",
    "[ ht ]    although the model i behaviour is confirmed up to @xmath10 and explained easily , beyond @xmath10 , the raw data do not give any information about the dynamical exponents @xmath14 and @xmath31 as no straight forward power law fittings are possible .",
    "while an alternative method to calculate @xmath31 is not known , one may have an estimate of @xmath14 using an indirect method .",
    "it has been shown recently that for various dynamical ising models , the time @xmath67 to reach saturation varies as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is identical to the dynamical exponent @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "one may attempt to do the same here .",
    "[ ht ]    actually it is possible to find out theoretically the form of @xmath67 from the qualitative behaviour of the dynamical quantities described above and the snapshot of the system ( fig .",
    "[ snap ] ) at times beyond @xmath10 . at @xmath70",
    ", the domain sizes of the neighbours of any spin at the boundary appear equal such that the domain walls perform random walks slowing down the annihilation process .",
    "domain walls annihilate only after one of the neighbouring domains shrinks to a size @xmath71 again . in a small system",
    ", one can see that the slow process continues with only two domain walls separating two domains remaining in the system at later times ( fig .",
    "[ snap ] ) . even in larger systems",
    ", there will be only a few domain walls remaining making @xmath72 at @xmath70 as we note from the inset of fig [ domaincolp ] : @xmath73 remains close to @xmath74 for a long time before going to zero .",
    "thus @xmath67 will have two components , @xmath10 , already defined and @xmath75 , the time during which there is a slow variation of quantities over time and the last two domains remain . while @xmath76 , one can argue that @xmath77 .",
    "the argument runs as follows : let us for convenience consider the open boundary case . here",
    ", the size sensitivity of the spins is @xmath78 where @xmath79 with the system assuming the model i behaviour for @xmath80 . at very late times",
    ", there will remain only one domain boundary in the system separating two domains of size , say , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , such that @xmath83 . with both @xmath84",
    "the domain wall will perform random walk until either of the domains shrinks to a size @xmath85 .",
    "( this picture is valid for @xmath86 and otherwise the dynamics will be simple model i type ) .",
    "let us suppose that the domain with initial size @xmath82 shrinks to @xmath85 in time @xmath87 such that the domain wall performs a random walk over a distance @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "this gives @xmath90 or , the average value of @xmath87 is given by @xmath91 the result for the periodic boundary condition is obtained by putting @xmath92 such that @xmath93 and therefore @xmath94 the above form is also consistent with the fact that @xmath95 for @xmath96 and @xmath97 for @xmath7 .",
    "[ ht ]    for large @xmath2 , the second term in the above equation will dominate making @xmath98 . in order to verify this , we have numerically obtained @xmath67 and plotted @xmath99 against @xmath100 for different @xmath2 and found a nice collapse and a fit compatible with eq ( [ tsat ] ) ( fig . [ sattime ] ) with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we conclude therefore that in the thermodynamic limit at later times , for any @xmath103 , @xmath6 , i.e. , the dynamics is diffusive .",
    "this argument , in fact holds for @xmath45 as well showing that for @xmath37 finite , @xmath6 , as discussed in the preceding section .",
    "[ ht ]    we have discussed so far the time dependent behaviour and exponents only .",
    "but another exponent @xmath104 which appears at @xmath105 for the persistence probability can also be extracted here .",
    "the persistence probabilities show the conventional saturation at large times , with the saturation values depending on @xmath2 .",
    "the log - log plot of @xmath106 against @xmath2 shows that power law behaviour is obeyed here with the exponent @xmath104 once again coinciding with the model i value , @xmath107 for any value of @xmath108 ( fig . [ per ] ) .    having obtained @xmath104 , we use eq ( [ alpha ] ) with trial values of @xmath14 to obtain a collapse of the data @xmath109 versus @xmath110 for any value of nonzero @xmath18 .",
    "as expected , an unique value of @xmath14 does not exist for which the data will collapse over all @xmath110 .",
    "however , we find that using @xmath111 , one has a nice collapse for initial times up to @xmath10 while with @xmath6 , the data collapses over later times ( fig .",
    "[ colpintlt ] ) .",
    "the significance of the result is , an unique value of @xmath104 is good for collapse for both time regimes .",
    "however , it is not possible to extract any value of @xmath31 for later times as @xmath31 is extracted from eq ( [ alpha ] ) in the limit @xmath112 only .",
    "[ ht ]      at this juncture , several comments and discussions are necessary .",
    "we have obtained a crossover behaviour in this model where an initial ballistic behaviour for macroscopic time scales is followed by a diffusive late time behaviour . however , the diffusive behaviour at later times is not apparent in the simple log - log plots of the variables and can be extracted only from the study of the total time to equilibriate .",
    "this is due to the fact that the initial ballistic dynamics leaves the system into a non - typical configuration which is evidently far from those on diffusion paths .",
    "in fact in the diffusive regime , the coarsening process hardly continues in terms of domain growth as only few domain walls remain at @xmath113 .",
    "a consequence of this is evident in the behaviour of the persistence at later times .",
    "one may expect that the persistence exponent 3/8 may be obtained at very late times as here one has independent random walkers , few in number , which annihilate each other as they meet much like in a reaction diffusion process .",
    "however , such an exponent is not observed from the data ( fig .",
    "[ percolp ] ) .",
    "although with @xmath6 we can obtain a collapse at later times , it is not possible to obtain a value of @xmath31 .",
    "since persistence is a non - markovian phenomena and it depends on the history , the exponent may not be apparent even if the phenomena is reaction diffusion like .",
    "therefore to analyse the dynamical scenario further , we study the persistence in a different way . in order to study the persistence dynamics beyond @xmath114",
    ", we reset the zero of time at @xmath114 . in case",
    "the number of domain walls left in the system at @xmath10 is of the order of the system size ( @xmath115 ) , the behaviour of persistence should be as in the case of ising model , i.e. , a power law decay with exponent 3/8 .",
    "on the other hand , if the number of independent random walkers is _ finite _",
    "( i.e. , vanishes in the @xmath116 limit ) which can not annihilate each other , the persistence probability is approximately @xmath117 where we have assumed that number of distinct sites visited by the walker is proportional to the distance travelled , which is @xmath118 .",
    "[ ht ]    we find that in the present case , resetting the zero of time at @xmath10 , the persistence probability shows a decay before attaining a constant value .",
    "the decay for a large initial time interval can be fitted to a form @xmath119 where the exponent @xmath120 increases with @xmath2 and clearly tends to saturate at 0.5 as the system size is increased .",
    "this shows that the persistence probability is identical to ( [ single ] ) in form ( fig .",
    "[ perlt ] ) .",
    "this signifies that at @xmath113 , the dynamics only involves the motions of random walkers which do _ not _ meet and annihilate each other for a long time and explains the fact that domain walls remain a constant over this interval . only at very large times close to equilibriation",
    "the domain walls meet and the persistence probability starts deviating from the behaviour given by ( [ single ] ) . actually once one of the neighbouring domains becomes less than @xmath59 in size , the random walk will cease to take place and will become ballistic , which finally leads to annihilation within a very short time .",
    "therefore although we have at later times independent walkers performing random walk , the power law behaviour with exponent 3/8 will never be observed ( even when the origin of the time is shifted ) as the annihilation here is not taking place as in a usual reaction diffusion system but determined by the model i like dynamics .",
    "it may also be noted that beyond @xmath114 , annihilations occur only when the system is very close to equilibriation unlike in a reaction diffusion system where annihilations occur over all time scales .",
    "the reason why a single value of @xmath104 is valid for both @xmath121 and @xmath122 is also clear from the above study .",
    "we expect that at @xmath114 , the number of persistent sites @xmath123 with the value of @xmath50 as in model i. the additional number of sites which become non - persistent beyond @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath124 and therefore at @xmath125 expected number of persistent site is @xmath126 where @xmath127 are proportionality constants .",
    "since in the thermodynamic limit @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the number of persistence sites remains @xmath130 .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath131 to be independent of @xmath2 , the assumption is justified by the result .",
    "in this section , we briefly report the behaviour of the system when each spin is assigned a value of @xmath132 randomly from a uniform distribution .",
    "the randomness is quenched as the value of @xmath0 assumed by a spin is fixed for all times .",
    "here we note that the equilibrium behaviour , all spins up or down is once again achieved in the system .",
    "however the time to reach equilibrium values are larger than the @xmath7 case .",
    "[ ht ]    the entire dynamics of the system , once again , can be regarded as walks performed by the domain walls . for @xmath7 for all sites , the walks are ballistic with the tendency of a domain wall being to move towards its nearest one . for @xmath133 but same for all sites , as discussed in the previous section , the walk is either ballistic ( at initial times ) or diffusive ( at later times ) but identical for all the walkers .",
    "when @xmath0 is different for each site , one expects that when a site with a relatively large @xmath0 is hit , the corresponding domain wall will move towards its nearest domain wall while when a site with relatively small @xmath0 is hit , the dynamics of the domain wall will be diffusive .",
    "it has been previously noted that model i with noise ( of a different kind ) which induces similar mixture of diffusive and ballistic motions shows an overall ballistic behaviour ( for finite noise ) with the value of the dynamic exponent equal to unity @xcite . in the present model with",
    "quenched randomness also , we find , by analyzing the saturation times that @xmath111 . however , the variation of the magnetisation , domain walls and persistence show power law scalings with exponents corresponding to model i only for an initial range of time ( fig [ inset3 ] ) .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a model in which a cutoff is introduced in the size of the neighbouring domains as sensed by the spins .",
    "the cutoff @xmath37 is expressed in terms of a parameter @xmath0 . at @xmath45 ( finite @xmath37 ) and @xmath7 it shows pure diffusive and ballistic behavior respectively . in the uniform case where @xmath0 is same for all spins , a ballistic to diffusive",
    "crossover occurs in time for any nonzero @xmath134 .",
    "usually in a crossover phenomenon , where a power law behaviour occurs with two different exponents , the crossover is evident from a simple log - log plot . in this case",
    ", however , the crossover phenomena is not apparent as a change in exponents in simple log - log plots does not appear .",
    "the crossover occurs between two different types of phenomena , the first is pure coarsening in which domain walls prefer to move towards their nearest neighbours as in model i and one gets the expected power law behaviour . at @xmath10 , as mentioned before , some special configurations are generated and therefore the second phenomena involves pure diffusion of a few domain walls ( density of domain walls going to zero in the thermodynamic limit ) which remain non - interacting up to large times . naturally , the only dynamic exponent in the diffusive regime is the diffusion exponent @xmath6 which is _ distinct _ from the growth exponent @xmath111 .",
    "so the two dynamic exponents not only differ in magnitude , they are connected to distinct phenomena as well .",
    "this crossover behaviour is therefore a striking feature for the model .",
    "for @xmath37 finite ( @xmath3 ) , there is no crossover effect , as the time @xmath10 is too small to generate these special configurations and usual reaction diffusion type of behaviour prevails .",
    "persistence probability , in whichever way one sets the zero of time , does not show any power law behaviour in the second time regime . at the same time , a single value of @xmath104 is required for the collapse in the two regimes .",
    "another point of interest is that while @xmath6 is expected for nonzero @xmath135 values at later times , the behaviour of the total time to equilibriate as a function of @xmath0 is not obvious .",
    "our calculation shows that it is proportional to @xmath136 , which is another important result of the present work",
    ".    we also found that making @xmath0 a quenched random variable taken from an uniform distribution , one gets back model i like behaviour to a large extent .",
    "however , choosing a different distribution might lead to different results .",
    "the fact that the model has different behaviour with uniform @xmath0 and with quenched random value of @xmath0 is reminiscent of the different behaviour observed in agent based models with savings in econophysics @xcite .",
