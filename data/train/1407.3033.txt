    "jets and outflows are the most spectacular features of the star formation process .",
    "although infall and accretion are the key processes in star formation , they are difficult to observe directly .",
    "because models predict that jets and outflows correlate with accretion @xcite , they provide indirect probes of accretion .",
    "for example , the average outflow force is stronger in class 0 objects than class i sources , indicating that the mass accretion rate decreases as the central protostar evolves @xcite .",
    "analysis of outflows can also probe the energetics and chemistry that occur when the jets carve out the envelope to construct bipolar cavities .",
    "both high energy photons and shocks can heat the cavity walls farther from the central protostar than would be possible without the cavities @xcite .",
    "this bipolar cavity structure has been traced by the scattered emission at short wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) and by maps of outflows with high resolution ( e.g. , @xcite at 1.3 mm ) .",
    "recent observations with instruments aboard the @xmath5 space observatory ( hso , @xcite ) strongly suggest that the far - infrared ( fir ) line emission is predominantly produced by shocks associated with jets and outflows @xcite although energetic photons produced by the accretion process also contribute to exciting the fir line ( especially co line ) emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , according to the detailed models of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , molecules with temperatures of @xmath1100 - 1000 k emit most of their luminosity ( @xmath6 ) in the wavelength range of 50 to 200 @xmath0 m , which is covered by the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , covering the sed from 50 to 210 @xmath0 m , the pacs full sed range mode observations of a large number of embedded sources can provide an excellent opportunity to study the dependence of the gas cooling budget on evolutionary phase .",
    "however , kinematic constraints can not usually be obtained from unresolved pacs lines ( @xmath7 km / s ) .",
    "complementary kinematic information comes from the 557 ghz h@xmath2o 1@xmath8 - 1@xmath9 line survey with the heterodyne instrument for the far - infrared on @xmath5 ( hifi , @xcite ) obtained by the @xmath5 key programs ,  water in star forming regions with @xmath5 \" ( wish ) and  dust , ice , and gas in time \" ( digit ) carried out toward the same sources that were observed with pacs @xcite . according to @xcite , the h@xmath2o line emission is correlated with other evolutionary indicators such as , , and envelope mass as well as the indicators of outflow strength such as outflow momentum flux calculated from the co j=3 - 2 line and the line width of the 557 ghz water line . while hifi can resolve the 557 ghz water line into kinematic components in the protostellar system , the pacs spectra are well suited to study the cooling of the heated gas because all of dominant cooling lines are covered by the observations .",
    "we present pacs spectra toward 6 embedded ysos in taurus , from the digit program ( pi : n. evans , @xcite ) . because they are forming in the same environment , that variable can be removed .",
    "in particular , the taurus cloud exists in a region of low excitation by the interstellar radiation field , minimizing external radiation effects .",

    "tmr1 and l1527 both are shifted to the north - east from the central spaxel ; the strongest continuum emission for l1527 is still at the central spaxel while the emission peak is shifted to the ne by one spaxel for tmr1 . in tmr1 and l1527",

    ", @xcite derived an equation for line flux as a function of wavelength using strong co lines and applied the equation to all species , except for [ o i ] .",
    "however , the emission lines of different species are distributed differently .",
    "in addition , three of our sources are mispointed , so the line emission distributes over multiple spaxels .",
    "in particular , the atomic lines are spatially distinct from the molecular lines in our targets ; the atomic line emission is extended beyond the pacs psf , but molecular line emission is mostly compact at similar wavelengths . to solve this problem , we measured fluxes of the extended ( or mispointed ) line emission by calculating the equivalent width over multiple spaxels , over which the line emission distributes , as explained in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "however , the key concept of flux measurement in @xcite is the same as that in @xcite . both combine",
    "two data reductions done with two different herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe ) versions ( 6.1 , circa 2010 - 2011 and 8.1 , circa 2012 - 2013 ) to produce reliable absolute flux calibration as well as the best s / n ; for line fluxes , the equivalent width calculated from the hipe 8.1 reduction ( with a higher s / n ) is multiplied by the local continuum extracted from the whole 25 spaxels of the hipe 6.1 reduction ( with more accurate absolute flux calibration ) .",
    "we improved upon the reduction used in @xcite by applying correction factors to the blue and red spectra in order to align the different orders smoothly around 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "we calculated the correction factors using the pacs 70 and 160 @xmath0 m  photometric data , measured with the same aperture size as the pacs field of view because the continuum spectra are extracted from all 25 spaxels .",
    "the seds were convolved with the pacs wideband response functions to compare with actual photometric data .",
    "correction factors were found separately for the blue and red spectra and listed in table  [ factortable ] .    the flux of each transition of each source is listed in table  [ fluxtable ] .",
    "the line detection criterion was s / n@xmath163 from the gaussian line fitting .",
    "the errors presented in table  [ fluxtable ] are total flux errors calculated from the error propagation equation in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "however , the significance of line detection is decided by the rms noise of the baseline local to the line . in some sources , although the higher excitation lines are detected , the lower excitation co lines are listed as non - detections because of their higher noise levels .",
    "in addition , some of the h@xmath2o and co lines detected by karska et al .",
    "( 2013 ) were not detected in our observations .",
    "this apparent discrepancy in line detection is caused by the two different observing modes ; the rangescan mode used in this work accepts lower sensitivities to gain the full coverage of the pacs wavelength region , whereas the linescan mode from karska et al .",
    "( 2013 ) gains better spectral resolution and sensitivity over a very narrow wavelength range .",
    "in addition , the co j=14 - 13 flux is systematically lower than the co j=15 - 14 flux for all sources as listed in table  [ fluxtable ] because the level population of j=15 is greater than that of j=14 at the gas temperature above 250 k , which is the case in our sources ( see  4 ) .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ lines ] and table  [ fluxtable ] , l1489 , tmr1 , and tmc1 have very rich emission line spectra .",
    "in contrast to previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , these sources do not have very high bolometric luminosities .",
    "tmc1 , especially , has  less than 1 .",
    "the most luminous source among our targets is l1551-irs5 , but it does not show water lines except the @xmath17 174.6 @xmath0 m  transition .",
    "in addition , l1527 , which has been known as a prominent outflow class 0 source @xcite , shows neither high - j ( @xmath18 1500 k ) co transitions nor many water line transitions .    toward all 6 sources , 63 and 145 @xmath0",
    "m   lines are detected .",
    "the  157 @xmath0 m   line was also detected in all sources except l1489 .",
    "these atomic lines have been considered as good tracers of the strength of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) based on observations with the @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "however , it was difficult to separate the contribution from gas heated by the isrf from the contribution by the source itself because of the poor spatial resolutions of @xmath20 . because @xmath5 has much better spatial resolution than did @xmath20 ( by a factor of @xmath21 )",
    ", most @xmath5 observations have found that the emission distributes along the outflow direction @xcite , while  emission generally shows no correlation with the source , indicating that it comes from the surface of the cloud .",
    "atomic emission is also extended in our sources ; the  63 @xmath0 m  emission is extended along the known outflow direction in all sources , but the  157 @xmath0 m  line is too weak to determine its extent in most sources . however , in l1551-irs5 and tmc1 , the  line is strong and extended like the  line ( see fig .  [ l1551_oi_cii ] and  [ tmc1_oi_cii ] ) although their distributions differ somewhat . in tmc1-a ,",

    "the redshifted outflow located to the south in tmc1-a is very weak compared to the blueshifted component @xcite . unlike the atomic emission , almost all molecular transitions are compact and peaked on the continuum source ( see fig .",
    "27 of @xcite ) ; the mispointed sources do not seem to have extended emission structure either since the displacement of emission does not change with wavelength .",
    "no o and b type massive young stars exist near the taurus cloud to illuminate the large cloud structure .",
    "therefore , these sources might be the best places to study the  and  emission directly related to protostars themselves . indeed , in the taurus sources , the  emission is not diffuse and is very well correlated spatially with the  emission , which distributes along the outflow direction ( see fig .",

    "@xcite also pointed out that the  emission is extended along the outflow direction in tmc1 , and @xcite showed a similar trend in serpens smm1 .",
    "this might indicate that the main heating source of the atomic gas is the fast j - type shock , which can produce uv photons , and thus , dissociate h@xmath2o and co resulting in high abundances of o and c@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the atomic line emission may be produced along the outflow cavity wall , where high energy photons can penetrate to dissociate molecules to o and c@xmath22 @xcite . in the latter case ,",

    "[ correlation1 ] , the total fir line luminosities ( @xmath24 ) have no correlation with  ( bottom panel ) , which indicates that the line excitation is not simply related to the current source luminosity .",

    "therefore , in our samples , the correlation between @xmath24 and  is not statistically significant .",
    "however , as expected for embedded sources , the fir continuum luminosity ( @xmath26 ) in the pacs range tightly correlates with  ( @xmath27=0.98 with @xmath25-value=0.0006 ) ( see the upper panel of fig .  [ correlation1 ] ) ; we find the relation of @xmath28 .",

    "@xcite used the spectral mode of pacs to observe selected lines toward low mass protostars , including all of our targets , but not l1551-irs5 . in order to calculate the total co luminosity in the pacs range , they used rotational temperatures from a subset of lines within their linescans while they used the ratios of twelve h@xmath2o and four oh line fluxes with respect to the total h@xmath2o and oh fluxes in the full pacs range for ngc1333-iras4b and serpens smm1 to calculate the total pacs line luminosity of h@xmath2o and oh ( fig . 8 and table 4 of @xcite ) .",

    "the obvious result from our analysis is that water is not the most dominant coolant in most taurus cloud sources ; only in l1489 and tmr1 , about 40% of fir line luminosity is attributed to water lines while the water line luminosity is less than 20% of the total fir line luminosity for the other 4 sources . for l1551-irs5 , about 70 % of the fir line luminosity is contributed by with little contribution by h@xmath2o and oh , indicative of nearly complete dissociation of h@xmath2o and oh . the differing contributions of each species to the total fir line luminosity suggests different detailed heating and chemistry in each source .",
    "the simplest analysis of the rotational transitions of each molecule detected with pacs is the rotation diagram , where lines are assumed optically thin , and the same excitation temperature is applied to a range of level populations . @xcite and",
