    "since the interaction between bent needles is short - ranged , we use a combination of linked and verlet lists to check for the overlap of molecules after a monte carlo trial .",

    "the linked list is built by using a square decomposition of the simulation box .",

    "once these relatively small but highly packed clusters of particles form , molecule orientations can get kinetically locked .",
    "equilibration , however , requires overcoming the high free - energy barriers associated with aligning these clusters which considerably slows down equilibration . a way to alleviate this problem relies on the fact that monte carlo simulations need not be tied to a local and thus physical dynamics . instead of moving particles one at a time",
    ", one can define collective moves that identify groups of correlated particles and then move them as a single object@xcite .",

    "this approach heavily depends on the the concept of excluded area .    ,",
    "@xmath9 and the same orientation .",
    "the excluded area is obtained by repeatedly inserting the second molecule inside the box and checking for overlaps .",
    "the shaded region is obtained by placing a dot at the position of the center of mass of a randomly inserted particle if it overlaps with the fixed particle . ]",
    "given two molecules with a fixed relative orientation @xmath95 , then the excluded area @xmath96 is defined as the portion of the plane surrounding a molecule that is not accessible to the other .",

    "figure  [ fig : excluded area ] shows an example of the shape of the excluded area for two bow - shaped molecules with the same orientation ( @xmath97 ) . for hard - core potentials the excluded area is proportional to the second virial coefficient in an expansion of the free energy in powers of density .",
    "hence , @xmath98 provides a microscopic description of the balance between positional and orientational entropy .",

    "the size of the box is chosen such that it is impossible for a molecule outside the box to overlap with the fixed molecule .",
    "another molecule with fixed relative orientation @xmath95 is then inserted at random in the box .",
    "the process is repeated @xmath100 times , keeping track of the number of overlaps @xmath101 that occurred during the whole process . in the end ,",

    "the critical value is the result of a balance between the disclination energy and entropy , and in two dimensions both have the same logarithmic dependence on system size . if @xmath111 , isolated disclinations are found , which leads to an overall isotropic state characterized by an exponential decay of the orientational correlation function .",

    "<S> we perform extensive monte carlo simulations of a two - dimensional bent hard - needle model in both its chiral zig - zag and its achiral bow - shape configurations and present their phase diagrams . </S>",

    "<S> this last phase consists of layers formed by supramolecular arches . </S>",
    "<S> they create a periodic modulation of the molecular polarity whose period is sensitively controlled by molecular geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we identify transition densities using correlation functions together with appropriately defined order parameters and compare them with predictions from onsager theory . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the molecular excluded area to deviations from onsager theory and simple liquid crystal phase morphology is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the isotropic  quasi - nematic transition to be consistent with a kosterlitz - thouless disclination unbinding scenario . </S>"
