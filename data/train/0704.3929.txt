    "investigation of nuclear systems with strangeness opens up a way to understand dense matter such as the neutron star core . since",
    "strange quarks are negatively charged and cancel the positive proton charge , they are favored in charge neutral dense matter . as a result ,",
    "many models predict hyperons would appear at around @xmath6 , and @xmath7 may share a similar or larger fraction to neutrons at very high densities .    in describing highly dense matter , we clearly need information on @xmath8 interaction not only for @xmath9 but also for @xmath10 such as @xmath11 , but spectroscopic information on cascade ( @xmath5 ) hypernuclear systems are severely limited at present . while old emulsion data suggest a deep @xmath1-nucleus potential ( @xmath12 )  @xcite , a shallow potential ( @xmath13 ) is suggested from the twin hypernuclear event found in a nuclear emulsion  @xcite .",
    "this shallow potential is also supported by the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) analysis of @xmath1 production spectra in the bound state region  @xcite .    in order to extract as much information as possible from the data available at present , we need to investingate the @xmath1 hypernuclear production spectra by @xmath2 reaction on nuclear targets in both of the _ continuum _ as well as the bound state region .",
    "since the dwia analysis in  @xcite strongly rely on the absolute value of the inclusive @xmath1 production yield , it is necessary to verify the consistency with the production spectra in the quasi free ( qf ) region  @xcite . for this purpose , the green s function method of dwia",
    "would be a useful tool , where the continuum and bound state spectra can be described on the same footing .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the @xmath1-nucleus potential through @xmath1 production spectra in the continuum and bound state region in the green s function method of dwia with the local optimal fermi averaging @xmath0-matrix ( lofat ) , in which the @xmath1-nucleus potential effects are included in both of the strength function and the transition amplitude .",
    "based on the analyses of the observed continuum and bound region spectra , we make predictions to the future coming @xmath1 hypernuclear production experiment at j - parc .",
    "we find that we should observe @xmath1 hypernuclear bound state peak structures in @xmath14 spectra on light nuclear targets such as @xmath3c and @xmath4al as far as the imaginary part of the @xmath1-nucleus optical potential is not large ( @xmath15 ) and the experimental resolution is good enough ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "for @xmath7 and @xmath38 productions , it is recently pointed out that on - shell kinematics in the fermi averaging ( optimal fermi averaging , ofa ) procedure roughly decide the shape of the qf spectrum  @xcite in the green s function method with factrized @xmath0-matrix , and similar procedure for @xmath0-matrix was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the semi",
    "classical distorted wave ( scdw ) analyses  @xcite , the local fermi averaging of the elementray cross section has been included . here",
    "we would like to incorporate both of the above two ideas ; we include the local optimal fermi averaging @xmath0-matrix ( lofat ) , @xmath39 , in the integrand of the response function eq .",
    "( [ eq : response ] ) .",
    "we define the lofat as ,    @xmath40    where @xmath41 denote the four total momenta in the elementary initial and final two - body states .",
    "we adopt the fermi distribution function for the target nucleon momentum distribution @xmath42 and parameters are taken from @xcite . in obtaining lofat , we define the @xmath43-th hadron single particle energy containing the nuclear and hypernuclear potential effects as , @xmath44 this treatment enables us to include the potential effects naturally through the effective mass @xmath45 , as adopted in transport models in high - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the lofat has the dependence on the collision point @xmath46 through hadron potentials @xmath47 .",
    "in the calculation , we have assumed the one body woods - saxon type hyperon - nucleus optical potential , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes @xmath1-core nucleus coulomb potential .",
    "we assume the imaginary part of optical potential @xmath54 to be @xmath55 mev , which simulates the strength in the quark cluster model and the nijmegen potential model d  @xcite estimations .",
    "we have adopted the elementary @xmath0-matrix , which is re - parameterized to fit the cross section and angle dependence for @xmath56 3  gev / c .",
    "figure [ figs : xi - qf ] shows the calculated results of @xmath1 qf production spectra with potential depth of 14 mev in comparison with experimental data @xcite .",
    "calculated curves reproduce the experimental data systematically on heavy targets , cu , ag , and pb , in the high @xmath57 region , where the hypernuclear excitation is small . in the lower @xmath57 region , other contributions",
    "have been known to be important  @xcite , including heavy - meson production and its decay , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 )  @xcite and the two - step strangeness exchange and production processes , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 )  @xcite .",
    "we underestimate the production spectra on lighter targets , @xmath3c and @xmath4al .",
    "the underestimate of qf spectrum on @xmath3c target is a common feature in previous dwia calculations  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is discussed that this underestimate may be due to the center - of - mass effects : for electron scattering on a nucleus with mass number @xmath62 , the center - of - mass correction in the shell model have been taken care of by a multiplicative factor @xmath63 $ ] for the form factor , where @xmath64 is the momentum transfer . with @xmath65 , the factor @xmath66 ^ 2",
    "$ ] amounts to 1.86 , 1.43 , 1.22 , 1.16 and 1.10 for @xmath3c , @xmath4al , @xmath67cu , @xmath68ag and @xmath69pb targets , respectively , at @xmath70 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have adopted a different elementary @xmath0-matrix parameterization  @xcite and larger isospin - averaged @xmath71 cross sections , then we can roughly explain the target mass dependence , as shown with the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ figs : xi - qf ] .    since",
    "our understanding is not complete and we have several ambiguities described above for the absolute yield in qf spectra , we introduce an adjustable multiplicative factor to fit the qf spectrum at low excitation energies ( high @xmath72 momentum region ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qf - factor ] , we show the calculated @xmath1 production spectra with @xmath1 potential depth of @xmath73 and @xmath74 mev with multiplicative factors in comparison with data  @xcite .",
    "the potential depth dependence is small in low @xmath57 region , and attractive potential shifts the spectrum towards the high @xmath57 direction slightly .",
    "when we adjust the multiplication factors as described above , calculated results reasonably well explain the qf spectrum .",
    "this means that we can not determine the potential depth accurately from the qf spectrum shape .    on the other hand ,",
    "production spectrum is more sensitive to the potential depth at low excitation energies , then there is a possibility that we can determine the potential depth as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figvdep ] , we show the results of the potential depth dependence of the calculated @xmath1 production spectrum on @xmath75c target at @xmath76 gev/@xmath77 multiplied by the factors described above in comparison with data  @xcite .",
    "_ evaluated the width of @xmath1 hypernuclear states ( @xmath78b+@xmath1 ) to possible double @xmath7 states based on the nijmegen model d potential as 1.2 mev and 0.5 mev for @xmath79^{j=1}$ ] and @xmath80^{j=0,2}$ ] , respectively  @xcite . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ figvdep ] , we show the ideal @xmath1 production spectra on @xmath75c target without the energy resolution folding . the imaginary part is assumed to be @xmath81  mev .",
    "these calculated spectra show that the @xmath1 hypernuclear state widths are in good agreements with the estimates in ref .  @xcite . in comparison with experimental data",
    ", these spectra must be folded using a gauss function . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ figvdep ] , we show the results with an experimental resolution of @xmath82 fwhm .",
    "since the experimental resolution is not enough to distinguish the bound state peaks and the statistics is low , we should compare the integrated yield in the bound state region .",
    "we find clear potential dependence in the bound state region , and with deep @xmath1 potential ( @xmath83 ) we may find a bump structure at around @xmath84 even with this low resolution . comparison with the data suggests that the potential depth around 14 mev is preferred in the present treatment , and if the statistics is high enough , it would be possible to determine the potential depth even with low resolution .",
    "the depth of the @xmath1-nucleus potential has been already suggested to be around 14 mev from the analysis of the @xmath2 spectrum in the bound state region  @xcite . in that analysis ,",
    "the @xmath0-matrix element is evaluated under the frozen nucleon momentum approximation , where the kinematics is given with zero initial nucleon momentum . in the present analysis , while the kinematics in the elementary process and the way to fix the absolute value are different preferred potential depth is similar .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the excitation energy dependence of lofat is weak and smooth since the covered @xmath72 momentum range is narrow in the bound state region .",
    "now we find that @xmath1-nucleus potential with 14 mev depth well describes the spectra in the bound state and qf region for light nuclear targets , then it would be valuable to predict the peak structure which would be observed in the future coming j - parc day - one experiment .",
    "sensitivity of calculated spectra for the @xmath1-nucleus potential is weak in the qf region because of the high momentum transfer @xmath85 500 mev / c , therefore it is difficult to extract precise potential information from the qf region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qf - factor ]    in fig .",
    "[ bs ] , we show the calculated @xmath72 spectra in the bound state region of @xmath2 reactions on @xmath75c , @xmath86al , @xmath87ag and @xmath88pb targets with a potential depth of @xmath89 , which explains the qf spectra and low resolution spectra in the bound region .",
    "we compare the results with @xmath90 ( solid lines ) and @xmath91 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "we assume that the experimental resolution of @xmath92 would be achieved .",
    "we find that bound state peaks are populated selectively due to high momentum transfer @xmath93 as in the @xmath7 production spectra by @xmath94 reactions ( @xmath95 ) , and these peaks can be identified in the high resolution experiment .    in the green s function method , target nucleon",
    "deep hole states are assumed to have large imaginary energies .",
    "therefore , calculated results may be overestimating the spectra around the ground state due to the long lorentzian tail from the deep hole states having finite contributions in this energy region .",
    "this problem will be discussed in the future .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath1-nucleus potential through cascade ( @xmath5 ) hypernuclear production spectra by @xmath2 reaction in the green s function method  @xcite of the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) with the local optimal fermi averaging @xmath0-matrix ( lofat )  @xcite .",
    "the calculated spectra are in good agreement with the experimental data for heavy targets . with the multiplicative factor adjusted to fit the spectra on light targets , we find that the calculated spectra well reproduce the observed spectrum  @xcite in shape and yield with @xmath1-nucleus potential depth around 14 mev .",
    "this potential depth is consistent with those suggested in previous works  @xcite .    while the dependence on the potential depth is small in the continuum region , it is clealy distinguished in the bound region . therefore , it would be possible to extract the @xmath1-nucleus potential depth from the production yield in the bound state region when the statistics is high enough .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1 bound state peak structure can be found in the @xmath2 spectra on light target such as @xmath3c and @xmath4al , as far as the imaginary part is not very large ( @xmath96 ) and the experimental resolution is improved ( @xmath97 ) , as expected in the j - parc experiment .",
