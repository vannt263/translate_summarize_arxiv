    "grb light curves measured with swift consist of a bat light curve in the 15  150 kev range followed , after slewing within @xmath2 s , by a detailed 0.3  10 kev xrt x - ray light curve @xcite .",
    "this information supplements our knowledge of the highly variable hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray light curves measured from many grbs with batse and other grb detectors .",
    "about one - half of swift grbs show x - ray flares or short timescale structure , sometimes hours or later after the onset of the grb .",
    "approximately @xmath3% of the swift grbs display rapid x - ray declines , and an additional @xmath4% display features unlike simple blast wave model predictions @xcite .",
    "we make three points in this paper :    1 .",
    "highly variable light curves can be produced by an external shock under the assumption that the grb blast wave does not spread , or spreads much more slowly than assumed from gas - dynamic or relativistic hydrodynamic models that do not take into account magnetic effects in grb blast waves .",
    "if this assumption is valid , then it is wrong to conclude that highly variable @xmath0-ray emissions , x - ray flares with @xmath5 , or late time x - ray flares require delayed central engine activity or colliding shells . 2 .   external shocks in grb blast waves can accelerate cosmic ray protons and ions to @xmath1 ev , making grbs a logical candidate to accelerate the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "3 .   escape of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) takes place from an external shock formed by an expanding grb blast wave on time scales of a few hundred seconds for the observer .",
    "blast - wave deceleration due to the loss of the internal hadronic energy is proposed @xcite to be the cause of x - ray declines in grb light curves observed with swift .",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the interaction between a grb blast - wave shell and an external stationary cloud @xcite .",
    "the analysis is performed under the assumption that the cloud width @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the distance of the cloud from the grb explosion .",
    "the interaction is divided into three phases : ( 1 ) a collision phase with both a forward and reverse shock ; ( 2 ) a penetration phase where either the reverse shock has crossed the shell while the forward shock continues to cross the cloud , or vice versa ; and ( 3 ) an expansion phase , where both shocks have crossed the cloud and shell , and the shocked fluid expands .",
    "the shell width is written as @xmath8 and the proper number density of the relativistic shell is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the coasting lorentz factor of the grb blast wave , and @xmath11 is the apparent isotropic energy release .",
    "short timescale flaring requires ( a ) a strong forward shock , which from the relativistic shock jump conditions @xcite imply a maximum cloud density given by @xmath12 and ( b ) significant blast - wave deceleration to provide efficient energy extraction , which occurs in clouds with thick columns @xcite , that is , with densities @xmath13 these two conditions translate into the requirement that @xmath14 in order to produce short timescale variability .",
    "the short timescale variabilty condition @xcite for quasi - spherical clouds is @xmath15    using eq .",
    "( [ delta(x ) ] ) for the shell width , eqs .  ( [ deltacl ] ) and ( [ deltacl ] )",
    "imply the requirement that @xmath16 in order to produce rapid variability from an external shock .",
    "hence the production of @xmath0-ray pulses and x - ray flares from external shocks depends on whether the grb blast - wave width spreads in the coasting phase according to eq .",
    "( [ delta(x ) ] ) , with @xmath17 , as is generally argued . in the gas - dynamical study of @xcite , inhomogeneities in the grb fireball",
    "produce a spread in particle velocities of order @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 when @xmath20 .",
    "this dependence is also obtained in a hydrodynamical analysis @xcite .",
    "two points can be made about these relations .",
    "first , the spread in @xmath21 considered for a spherical fireball is averaged over all directions .",
    "as the fireball expands and becomes transparent , the variation in fluid motions or gas particle directions over a small solid angle @xmath22 of the full sky becomes substantially less .",
    "second , the particles within a magnetized blast - wave shell will expand and adiabatically cool so that the fluid will spread with thermal speed @xmath23 .",
    "the comoving width of the blast wave is @xmath24 , so that the spreading radius @xmath25 .",
    "adiabatic expansion of nonrelativistic particles can produce a very cold shell with @xmath26 , leading to very small shell widths .",
    "the requirement on the thinness of @xmath27 does not apply to the adiabatic self - similar phase , where the width is necessarily @xmath28 , as implied by the relativistic shock hydrodynamic equations @xcite . even in this case , however , @xmath29 if the blast wave is highly radiative @xcite . under the assumption of a strong forward shock and small clouds in the vicinity of a grb ,",
    "highly variable grb light curves are formed with reasonable efficiency ( @xmath30% ) to transform blast wave energy into @xmath0 rays @xcite .",
    "the maximum particle energy for a cosmic ray proton accelerated by an external shock in a grb blast wave is derived .",
    "consider a grb blast wave with apparent isotropic energy release @xmath31 ergs , ( initial ) coasting lorentz factor @xmath32 , and external medium density @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the comoving blast wave volume for the assumed spherically symmertric explosion , after reaching distance @xmath7 from the center of the explosion , is @xmath35 where the shell width @xmath36 ( the factor @xmath37 is the product of the geometrical factor @xmath38 and the factor @xmath39 from the continuity equations of relativistic hydrodynamics ; @xmath40 is the evolving grb blast wave lorentz factor ) .",
    "the hillas condition @xcite for maximum particle energy @xmath41 is that the particle larmor radius is less than the size scale of the system ; @xmath42 in the stationary frame ( primes refer to the comoving frame ) is given by @xmath43 the largest particle energy is reached at the deceleration radius @xmath44 when @xmath45 , where the deceleration radius @xmath46 hence @xmath47    the mean magnetic field @xmath48 in the grb blast wave is assigned in terms of a magnetic field parameter @xmath49 that gives the magnetic field energy density in terms of the energy density of the downstream shocked fluid , so @xmath50 thus @xmath51 @xcite , so that external shocks of grbs can accelerate particles to ultra - high and , indeed , super - gzk energies .",
    "implicit in this result is that acceleration occurs within the grb blast wave through , for example , second - order fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "acceleration to ultra - high energy through first - order relativistic shock acceleration requires a highly magnetized surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "if uhecrs are accelerated by grb blast waves , then blast - wave dynamics will be affected by the loss of internal energy when the uhecrs escape .",
    "this effect is proposed to explain the rapid x - ray declines in the swift grb light curves @xcite .",
    "photohadronic processes become important when the threshold condition @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the dimensionless photon energy , @xmath54 is the proton energy , and @xmath55 is the proton lorentz factor . for protons interacting with photons at the peak photon energy @xmath56 of the @xmath57 spectrum , @xmath58    the comoving timescale for a proton to lose a significant fraction of its energy through photohadronic processes",
    "is given by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 c$ ] , @xmath61 @xmath62b is the product of the photohadronic cross section and inelasticity , and the comoving energy density of photons with energy @xmath63 is @xmath64 .",
    "the relation between the measured @xmath65 flux @xmath66 and internal energy density is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 cm is the luminosity distance of the grb . for protons interacting with photons with energy @xmath69",
    ", we therefore find that the comoving time required for a proton with energy @xmath70 ( as measured by an observer outside the blast wave ) to lose a significant fraction of its energy through photohadronic processes is @xmath71 where @xmath72 cm and @xmath73 ergs @xmath74 s@xmath75 is the @xmath57 flux measured at @xmath76 ; the relation between @xmath70 and @xmath76 is given by eq .",
    "( [ epk ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the terms @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 on observer time in eq .",
    "( [ tprimephipi ] ) can be analytically expressed for the external shock model in terms of the grb blast wave properties @xmath11 , @xmath10 , environmental parameters , e.g. , @xmath81 , and microphysical blast wave parameters @xmath49 and @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this can also be done for other important timescales , for example , the ( available ) comoving time @xmath83 since the start of the grb explosion , the comoving acceleration time @xmath84 , written as a factor @xmath85 times the larmor timescale @xcite , the escape timescale @xmath86 in the bohm diffusion approximation , and the proton synchrotron energy loss timescale @xmath87 .",
    "1 shows the rates ( or the inverse of the timescales ) for @xmath88 ev protons in the case of an adiabatic blast wave that decelerates in a uniform surrounding medium .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "1 uses the parameter set @xmath89 and the right - hand panel uses the parameter set @xmath90 the characteristic deceleration timescale in the left and right cases , given by @xmath91 s , is @xmath92 s and @xmath93 s , respectively .    for these parameters , it takes a few hundred seconds to accelerate protons to energies @xmath94 ev , at which time photohadronic losses and escape start to be important .",
    "photohadronic losses inject electrons and photons into the grb blast wave .",
    "the electromagnetic cascade emission , in addition to hyperrelativistic electron synchrotron radiation from neutron escape followed by subsequent photohadronic interactions @xcite , makes a delayed anomalous @xmath0-ray emission component as observed in some grbs @xcite .",
    "ultra - high energy neutrino secondaries are produced by the photohadronic processes .",
    "detection of high - energy neutrinos from grbs would confirm the importance of hadronic processes in grb blast waves .",
    "the ultra - high energy neutrons and escaping protons form the uhecrs with energies @xmath1 ev .",
    "the grb blast wave rapidly loses internal energy due to the photohadronic processes and particle escape .",
    "the blast wave will then rapidly decelerate , producing a rapidly decaying x - ray flux . as argued in more detail elsewhere",
    "@xcite , the rapidly decaying fluxes in swift grbs are signatures of uhecr acceleration by grbs .",
    "if this scenario is correct , glast will detect anomalous @xmath0-ray components , particularly in those grbs that undergo rapid x - ray declines in their x - ray light curves .",
