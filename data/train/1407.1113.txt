    "we use the sse qmc method to compute several physical quantities averaged over @xmath52 realizations of the random bonds in each case .",

    "this scaling of @xmath77 is also of course suitable for studying @xmath12 criticality ( which is in the end what we will find for the dynamic exponent ) , regardless of any remaining finite - temperature effects .",

    "in this section we use results of large - scale sse studies with the @xmath77-doubling scheme to study critical properties of the ground state of the system at disorder strength @xmath50 .",

    "we also study the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a common way to locate quantum phase transitions by finite - size scaling is to examine a quantity which is expected to be independent of the system size at the critical point .",

    "it seems very plausible that this form here is also due to the same conditions as mentioned above ( with finite - size gapped nel - phase clusters in a background of the dominant quantum - paramagnetic phase ) .    to study the @xmath81 dependent susceptibility we again first investigated finite size effects and in results presented here go down only to temperatures where we can avoid them .",
    "when the length of the system is larger than @xmath78 finite - size effects can be excluded down to @xmath163 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath164 is shown in fig .",
    "[ glassphasetrans ] for this system size and different @xmath82 values . when @xmath165 , deep inside the quantum paramagnetic phase , the standard exponential form ( [ suscrelation ] ) applies , while in the nel phase the temperature dependence is very weak at low @xmath81 . between these well - understood regimes",
    "we find a clearly decreasing susceptibility as @xmath28 , but not with the pure exponential form ( [ parasusc ] ) . as shown in detail for three @xmath82-values in fig .",
    "[ glassphase ] , we instead see the stretched exponential form ( [ suscrelation ] ) with the exponent @xmath29 depending on @xmath82 .",
    "this form indicates that the system is gapless but there is no magnetic order ( in which case the susceptibility must be non - zero for @xmath32 by hydrodynamic arguments @xcite ) .",
    "the stretched exponential should then be a characteristic of the mg state .",
    "it is not easy to locate the phase boundary between the mg to quantum paramagnet , but in principle a detailed study of the exponent @xmath29 versus @xmath82 should allow for this .     systems .",
    "when @xmath166 ( in the nel phase ) , the curves flatten out and converge to a non - zero constant ( flat line ) .",

    "when @xmath168 a standard exponential decay @xmath169 is found ( fitted curve shown ) , indicating a gapped quantum paramagnet , while for smaller @xmath170 there are significant deviations from the exponential form ( the lines are here drawn to go through the data for the higher temperatures ) , suggesting the system is a mott glass.,width=321 ]",
    "we have introduced a dimerized 2d antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with three coupling constants @xmath171 , where the @xmath23 and @xmath27 couplings reside randomly on bonds forming columns on the simple square lattice .",
    "we have studied the ground state phases and quantum phase transitions of the model using unbiased sse qmc simulations on lattices with several thousand spins . using finite - size and finite - temperature scaling of several different quantities",
    ", we have shown that , in spite of the presence of relatively strong disorder ( the ratio of the two intra - dimer couplings being @xmath172 at the critical point ) , the universality class of the system remains in the same standard o(3 ) universality class as clean dimerized heisenberg models . the harris criterion for relevance of disorder",
    "is therefore violated .",
    "violation of the harris criterion was previously found in a dimer system with no randomness in the values of intra- and inter - dimer couplings , but with the dimers arranged randomly.@xcite evidence is this mounting for very generic non - applicability of the harris criterion in a broad class of dimerized heisenberg models . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only case where the harris criterion was shown to be valid in dimerized quantum spin models was for a bilayer where some fraction of dimers were completely removed in a random fashion.@xcite naively one might not expect these different cases of disorder to lead to different universality classes ( since the symmetries are the same ) and the reasons why they are different certainly deserve further examination . given the loopholes @xcite of the harris original @xcite and generalized @xcite analysis of critical points in the presence of disorder , it is now becoming clear that the issue of relevance or irrelevance is much more complex than previously believed .",
    "we also found a mott glass phase by tuning the disorder and interaction strength beyond the critical point where the nel order vanishes . here",
    "the system is incompressible , as in the quantum paramagnet reached eventually , but there is no magnetic order and the susceptibility follows a stretched exponential form , @xmath8 with @xmath9 , instead of the normal exponential form dictated by the gap in the quantum paramagnetic phase ( i.e. , @xmath173 and @xmath115 equals the singlet - triplet gap ) .",
    "the natural interpretation of the stretched exponential is that , within the griffiths scenario of domains of nel - phase clusters inside the quantum paramagnet , the clusters have finite size gaps decaying as a power - law with the size of the clusters ( as has been argued also in the context of a disordered boson model.@xcite . in a previous study of a disordered @xmath158 system",
    "the same kind of stretched exponential form was found,@xcite but in that case @xmath160 was always observed . in our case",
