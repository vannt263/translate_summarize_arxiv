    "the method for an approximate solution of the equations has been derived for the mean energy and for the variance of the energy distributions .",
    "it has been shown that the energy distribution variance as a function of the target thickness is a curve with a maximum if the incident energy spread is small .",
    "it is shown that the equation for calculation of the variance can be used to study the variation of the energy spread in the laser - electron storage ring ( lesr ) where an electron beam repeatedly encounters the laser pulses .",
    "it has been shown that the variation of the energy spread in this case depends on the incident value of the variance .",
    "the energy spread damping takes place if the incident energy spread is larger than some limit value .",
