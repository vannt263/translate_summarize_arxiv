    "these , in turn , are used with empirical calibrations of on - going sfrs derived from nearby galaxies under the assumption that the mid - ir flux arises from the reprocessed light from young , luminous stars . however , these circumstances are not well understood , partly because of the different physical mechanisms and timescales probed by the ir compared to recombination lines or uv emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "here we recognize that when intermediate mass stars join the thermally - pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) , they do not uniformly have the colors of lower - mass tp - agb m stars but , as c stars , are particularly luminous in the mid - ir , with most of their energy emitted between 20@xmath8 and 45@xmath9 m ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "knowing the importance of the tp - agb at red and near - ir wavelengths @xcite , and , using near- to mid - ir colors of galactic tp - agb populations , we empirically calibrate the contributions of such stars to the integrated mid - ir luminosities of stellar populations . using simple models ,",
    "we show that the mid - ir luminosities of galaxies are specifically in the sensitivity of the mid - ir to the amount of stellar mass formed in the previous 1.5 gyr , naturally complimenting the optical and near - uv .",
    "our calculations explicitly rely on the fraction of @xmath0-band light produced by the tp - agb as a function of the age of a simple stellar population ( ssp ) .",
    "figure 13 of @xcite and figure 1 of @xcite show the tp - agb s contribution to the @xmath0-band as a function of time , here approximated in our figure [ fig : agbf](a ) . between 0.1 and 1.5 gyrs , the tp - agb is responsible for roughly half the luminosity at @xmath0 . at solar metallicity , and between 0.2 and 1.5 gyrs , stars have sufficient mass to become c stars @xcite . at earlier times",
    "hot bottom burning prevents stars from inverting c / o ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "lower mass stars that contribute to the @xmath0-band over a hubble time also remain o - rich .",
    "consequently , most assume the tp - agb to have the color of m stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "knowing how the luminosity of the tp - agb evolves at @xmath0 allows one to compute the integrated mid - ir luminosity if the near- to mid - ir color for the ensemble of stars on the tp - agb is known as a function of time .",
    "there now exist sufficient data in the literature for galactic tp - agb stars to constrain such colors , and we adopt the mid - ir bands [ 8.8 ] , [ 12.5 ] , [ 14.6 ] , and [ 21.3 ] from the work of @xcite and @xcite .    using @xmath10 galactic tp - agb c stars from @xcite and @xcite , and conservatively excluding stars redder than @xmath11>10 $ ] mag to reduce any bias towards ir - luminous post - agb objects , we compute mean colors for the population of dust - enshrouded galactic tp - agb c stars of @xmath12 mag for the four bandpasses , respectively ( vega magnitudes ; zeropoints from * ? ? ?",
    "we do not claim that all stars with sufficient mass have these colors upon joining the tp - agb , but that they are dusty and ir luminous , such that when averaged over timescales longer than the tp - agb lifetimes ( @xmath13 yrs ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this color is a good approximation for the ensemble . using @xcite ,",
    "we compute ensemble colors of @xmath14 mag for tp - agb m stars .    formal errors in these colors are smaller than the systematic uncertainties , which have been listed above .",
    "these were computed by varying the color bounds of the tp - agb and by using several different estimators .",
    "these uncertainties dominate the errors in subsequent modeling .",
    "tp - agb ensemble colors are critical , and use of the galactic samples assumes that these stars adequately sample the phases of tp - agb evolution .",
    "we now combine figure [ fig : agbf](a ) with the knowledge that the c star ensemble color should be used for ssp ages within @xmath15 gyr , and the m ensemble color for all other ages .",
    "whether stars have sufficient mass to become c stars depends on mass - loss and the efficiency of dredge - up , both of which are sensitive to metallicity @xcite . for the purposes of making initial estimates of the contribution of the tp - agb in the mid - ir , we ignore these important effects .",
    "the colors given in the previous section imply that for ages less than 1.5 gyr , the tp - agb emits more than twice as much energy in the [ 12.5 ] band as it does in @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , a young galaxy at @xmath5 with a @xmath16 should have a luminosity of @xmath17 , equivalent to a lirg with @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : agbf](b ) and ( c ) illustrate this key point at redshifts where the mips @xmath19 m band corresponds to [ 12.5 ] and [ 8.8 ] .",

    "very young stars ( @xmath20 myr ) and those older than 1.5 gyr will produce only tp - agb m stars , delineating the minimum output in the mid - ir relative to @xmath0 , shown by the red line .",

    "[ fig : agbf](d ) we expand these simple comparisons to the redshift range @xmath2 to @xmath3 .    it is striking that the circumstellar material of evolved stars alone , up to 1.5 gyr old , can explain the observed mid - ir luminosities of galaxies back to @xmath3 .",
    "for galaxies near the lower bound , a substantial fraction of their @xmath19 m fluxes may originate purely from old stars , even at early times , where the actual fractions will depend on more precise modeling .",
    "this conclusion is fully consistent with earlier work by @xcite , whose modeling of passively evolving galaxies in the hudf ( see fig . [",
    "fig : agbf ] ) at @xmath21 highlighted contributions of the tp - agb at restframe near - ir wavelengths . using the [ 8.8]-[21.3 ] colors of the tp - agb ensembles derived above",

    "we construct simple star - formation histories to study the observed correlations of the mid - ir with restframe optical bands . by doing",
    "so we can check our hypothesis against the well - observed evolution of the global properties of galaxies .",
    "more sophisticated efforts to incorporate the tp - agb into population synthesis have a number of unsolved issues @xcite and physically motivated models @xcite do not yet adequately match the broad range of observed mid - ir colors of tp - agb c stars @xcite .",
    "therefore we explore the mid - ir luminosities of stellar populations as a function of redshift using our empirical calibration of the mid - ir luminosity of the tp - agb .",
    "the ensemble colors of tp - agb stars have been shown to describe the range of mid - ir luminosities of normal galaxies back to @xmath3 .",
    "we now use model star formation histories ( sfhs ) to compare the evolution of stellar populations in the mid - ir with the evolution of galaxy colors .",

    "@xcite , and others , have calibrated the underlying sfr as a function of mid - ir luminosity and , though our models reproduce this correlation , the timescale probed by this relation is much longer than has been assumed in the past .",
    "in other words , the mid - ir is explicitly sensitive to star formation over the timescales that galaxies produce populations of tp - agb c stars , or 1.5 gyr ( confirming the earlier results of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "together these results also imply that the relationship between rates of on - going star formation and mid - ir fluxes will be complicated by the detailed sfhs within a 1.5 gyr windows .",
    "bursts that occur at @xmath61 and decay with @xmath62 gyr , still produce substantial mid - ir fluxes at @xmath5 , resulting in _ estimated _ sfrs @xmath63 higher than actual on - going rates . for @xmath64 gyr , the factor is @xmath65 .",
    "using the @xmath66 gyr exponential timescale for the decline of the star formation rate density of the universe at late times implies that the mid - ir is an over - estimate by at least 50% .",
    "taken a step further , post - starburst and `` green valley '' galaxies may simply be luminous in the mid - ir because tp - agb c stars continue to appear long after the cessation of major star formation activity .    calculating the impact on the star formation rate density",
    "ultimately requires knowing the frequency , duration , and intensity of major mass building events .",
    "given the unknown duty cycles of major star forming events , mid - ir - based star formation rates of individual galaxies at @xmath5 should be treated with skepticism at a level of at least a factor of two , with additional uncertainties in star formation rate densities .",

    "the simple model is missing @xmath82 of the flux , but given uncertainties in using @xmath76 color as a proxy for age , uncertain extinction corrections , and unaccounted metallicity effects , we can not rule out additional contributions from interstellar cirrus . in regions of intense star formation , which are known to be dust enshrouded",
    ", the model also underproduces the mid - ir fluxes , but such regions do not comprise the bulk of m81 s luminosity .",
    "we conclude that the extended , diffuse mid - ir emission noted by @xcite arises from the stellar populations of the galaxy .",
    "this result is consistent with the analysis of m33 by @xcite , who employed a more limited set of models and argued that dusty circumstellar envelopes of evolved agb stars may be the source of the bulk of m33 s diffuse 8@xmath1 m and 24@xmath1 m emission .",
    "the contribution of the tp - agb to the @xmath0-band has been combined with with the mean ir colors of galactic tp - agb c and m stars in order to estimate the contributions of both young and old stellar populations to mid - ir observations of galaxies . without tuning ,",

    ", more detailed histories of star formation should be possible .",
    "unfortunately , stellar spectral libraries and theoretical modeling are neither sufficient for verifying nor reducing the uncertainties our models @xcite .",
    "this is largely due to the great difficulty in modeling post - main - sequence evolution , including the envelopes of tp - agb stars , though the uv may provide further constraints @xcite .",
    "we are optimistic that improved characterization of the mid - ir colors of the tp - agb can be incorporated into sed fitting , though our calculations have uncertainties perhaps on the order of a factor of two due to uncertainties in the ensemble colors of the tp - agb populations at different ages . with refinement",
    "we anticipate that incorporating the mid - ir into multiwavelength analysis of seds will provide the strongest constraints on the star formation histories of galaxies .",
    "there is little doubt that star formation and the growth of stellar mass was occurring more rapidly in the distant universe than today , but the nature of that growth has remained largely unknown .",
