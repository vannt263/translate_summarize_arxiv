    "clusters of galaxies are among the most important objects for cosmological studies . models of large scale structure formation such as cdm , predict that the abundance of clusters is determined by the spectrum of primordial perturbations and cosmological parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "observations of clusters at different redshifts can be used to constrain these parameters ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 , kaiser 1986 , white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 , henry & arnaud 1991 , viana & liddle 1996 , henry 1997 ) . following a different approach , observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) in a large sample of distant clusters can be used for a direct measurement of the distance to these clusters , and thus provide the values of @xmath15 ( e.g. , birkinshaw , hughes , & arnaud 1991 ) and  @xmath16 .    up until the present",
    ", the largest samples of distant clusters resulted from optical surveys that searched for enhancements in the surface density of galaxies ( e.g. , postman et al .",
    "this method suffers seriously from projection effects ( e.g. , van haarlem et al .",
    "distant clusters found by such techniques as galaxy concentrations around distant radio sources ( dickinson 1996 ) or `` dark '' lenses ( hattori et al .  1997 ) can not be considered as statistical samples . of all methods for detecting distant clusters ,",
    "x - ray surveys are the least sensitive to projection , because the x - ray emission is proportional to the square of the density of the hot gas , which must be compressed in a deep potential well for us to detect it .",
    "it is noteworthy that unlike optical , x - ray surveys have the possibility of finding interesting objects such as `` fossil '' clusters in which almost all galaxies have merged to form a cd galaxy ( ponman et al .",
    "1994 ) , and hypothetical `` failed '' clusters in which galaxy formation was suppressed ( tucker et al .",
    "1995 ) . to date ,",
    "the largest published sample of distant x - ray selected clusters is that from the _ einstein _ extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; goia et al .  1990 ,",
    "stocke et al .  1991 ) .",
    "however , because of the relatively high flux limit , the emss sample contains only 6 clusters at @xmath6 .    finding clusters in x - rays",
    "is complicated by their rarity among other types of sources . a comparison of the @xmath9 relations for all sources ( hasinger et al .",
    "1993a ) and clusters ( this work ) shows that at a flux of @xmath17  in the 0.52  kev band , clusters comprise not more than 1020% of the total source population .",
    "the large amount of optical identification work needed for cluster selection can be greatly reduced if they are searched for among spatially extended x - ray sources .",
    "even at @xmath18 , a rich cluster with a core - radius of 250  kpc has an angular radius of @xmath19 , which still can be resolved with the pspc on - axis .",
    "detection of extended sources requires new analysis techniques .",
    "even if the spatial extent is not used for cluster selection , special detection techniques are needed because clusters at @xmath20 are 34 times broader than the pspc point spread function .",
    "the idea of selecting distant cluster samples from various surveys was pursued by different groups in the past few years .",
    "rosati et al.(1995 , 1998 ) searched for clusters in long exposure ( @xmath21  ksec ) pspc pointed observations with a total area of 50  deg@xmath22 , using optical identifications of all extended x - ray sources found by wavelet transform analysis .",
    "their sample consists at present of 70 clusters .",
    "the wide angle pointed survey ( warps , scharf et al .",
    "1997 , jones et al .",
    "1998 ) uses the voronoi tessellation and percolation technique to detect both point - like and extended sources , followed by optical identifications of all sources .",
    "the warps cluster sample consists at present of 46 clusters found in pointings with exposures @xmath23  ksec , covering 16.2  deg@xmath22 .",
    "a small sample of 15 clusters at @xmath24 was identified by the sharc survey ( collins et al .",

    "their results on cluster evolution appear to contradict other surveys ( collins et al .",
    "1997 ) , probably because the point source detection algorithm had a low efficiency for detecting extended cluster emission .",
    "finally , important information about the surface density of clusters at very low fluxes is provided by several very deep pointings in which complete optical identifications are performed ( e.g.  mchardy et el .",
    "note that because of the small area , none of the aforementioned surveys is able to study the luminosity function of distant clusters above @xmath25  ergs  s@xmath3 , where the deficit of high redshift emss clusters was reported ( henry et al .",
    "1992 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present a sample of distant clusters selected from 647 pspc observations of high galactic latitude targets , covering a solid angle of 158 square degrees , a factor of three larger than the largest of the other surveys .",
    "the source catalog includes 200 optically confirmed clusters , and thus is one of the largest x - ray selected samples , comparable in size only to the all - sky survey sample of nearby clusters ( ebeling et al .",
    "we detect cluster candidates as extended x - ray sources using the wavelet decomposition technique described in this paper and maximum likelihood fitting of the surface brightness distributions to determine the significance of the source extent .",
    "we then identify only significantly extended sources with optical follow - up observations .",
    "optical observations confirm that 90% of our sources are indeed clusters of galaxies .",
    "various selection effects such as the fraction of clusters which remain unresolved or undetected , are studied using extensive monte - carlo simulations .",
    "comparison of the @xmath9 relation for clusters derived from our and other surveys shows that our cluster counts at the bright end are in excellent agreement with those from the all - sky survey sample of ebeling et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . at a flux of @xmath7 ,",
    "our @xmath9 relation agrees well with the warps survey ( jones et al .",

    "cluster size and flux estimates throughout the paper use @xmath26  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 and @xmath27 .",
    "all x - ray fluxes and luminosities are reported in the 0.52  kev energy band .",
    "we analyzed only pspc pointings at high galactic latitudes , @xmath28 , and low absorption , @xmath29@xmath30 , excluding the 10  radius regions around the lmc and smc .",
    "low galactic latitude fields were not used because the absorption is large and nonuniform in these regions , and because a high density of stars complicates optical identifications .",
    "we also excluded observations of extended targets , such as known clusters of galaxies , nearby galaxies , snrs , and star clusters .",
    "as the only exception , we included the 2146 + 0413 pointing ( sequences 800150 and 800150a01 ) which was an x - ray follow - up of clusters selected optically in a blank field .",
    "all individual sequences with listed exposures longer than 2  ksec , meeting the above criteria and publicly available by april 1996 , were extracted from the data archive at gsfc . using s.  snowden s software",
    ", we cleaned the data excluding high background intervals .",
    "we also generated exposure maps using r4r7 detector maps ( energy range 0.52  kev ) weighted according to the average pspc background spectrum .",
    "multiple observations of the same target were merged .",
    "observations with cleaned exposures @xmath31  ksec were discarded .",
    "the final dataset consists of 647 fields , schematically shown in galactic coordinates in fig  [ fig : fieldsgal ] .",
    "we used only hard band images , 0.62  kev , which increases the sensitivity of cluster detection given that the spectrum of the background is much softer than that of a typical cluster .",
    "this energy band is slightly different from that used for the exposure map generation , but this discrepancy results only in a very small , @xmath32 , error in the vignetting correction in the inner region of the field of view where clusters are detected . to oversample the psf adequately , an image pixel size of 5was chosen .",
    "our next step was to calculate the background map for each observation .",
    "the pspc background can not be modeled simply using the exposure map template because of the non - uniformity of the cosmic x - ray background , the presence of scattered solar x - rays , and the wings of the psf around bright sources .",
    "the angular correlation function of the xrb ( vikhlinin & forman 1995 , soltan et al .",
    "1996 ) predicts @xmath33 brightness fluctuations on a @xmath34 scale . if not modeled , such background variations can cause errors in measured cluster fluxes . since the best approximation to the background in each field is a smoothed source - subtracted image , we created background maps as follows .",
    "we first divided an image by its exposure map to remove the imprint of the pspc window support structure . using the wavelet decomposition technique (  [ sec : wd ] ) , we subtracted all sources with characteristic sizes @xmath35 in radius and smoothed the cleaned image with a @xmath36 gaussian .",
    "the background map was finally obtained as a product of the smoothed image and the exposure map .",
    "finding clusters in pspc images requires detection of sources of widely different angular size ranging from approximately the fwhm of the psf , @xmath37 , to several arcminutes .",
    "any algorithm for finding spatially extended sources solves two tasks : a ) source detection , i.e.identifying regions where the surface brightness significantly exceeds that of the background , and b ) determining extent , i.e.  deciding whether the detected source is significantly broader than the point spread function .",
    "the two - stage nature of extended source detection is not usually emphasized , but can be seen in practice .",
    "rosati et al .",
    "( 1995 ) convolved images with wavelet kernels of varying scale to find sources and then derived the source extent from wavelet amplitudes .",
    "scharf et al .  (",
    "1997 ) used voronoi tessellation and percolation ( vtp ) to find regions with enhanced surface brightness and then derived the source extent from the measured area and flux .",
    "each of these methods has advantages for certain tasks .",
    "for example , vtp can find extended sources regardless of their shape . however",
    ", none of these methods is optimal for both parts of the problem .",
    "obviously , the best sensitivity can be achieved if , at each stage , one uses a separate algorithm optimized for its task .",
    "we show below that our method of detecting sources using wavelets and determining source extent by maximum likelihood fitting is theoretically close to optimum for finding regularly - shaped clusters .",
    "the optimal method of source detection is matched filtering ( e.g.  pratt 1978 ) .",
    "for faint sources , the filter is close in shape to the sources themselves , and any filter with a shape close to the matched one performs almost equally well ( press et al .",
    "our wavelet detection method uses filters which approximate gaussians with @xmath38 pixels . since these filters span a range of sizes , nearly optimal detection is achieved for circular sources of any size . with an axially - symmetric filter , it is possible to miss very irregular sources .",
    "however , most clusters are relatively regular ( jones & forman 1998 ) for detection purposes .",
    "also , this shortcoming is clearly outweighed by the merits of the wavelet method , such as optimal detection of sources with regular shape , complete background subtraction and elimination of the influence of point sources .",
    "we discuss these issues below in detail .",
    "consider now the optimal method to discriminate between extended and point sources .",
    "cluster radial surface brightness profiles can be described by the so called @xmath39-model , @xmath40 ( e.g.cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) . therefore , to discriminate between a cluster and a point source , we should determine whether @xmath41 with core radius @xmath42 describes the data better than a @xmath43-function , that is , @xmath41 with @xmath44 . according to the _ neyman - pearson lemma _",
    "( e.g.  martin 1971 ) , the most sensitive test for this problem is the change in the value of the likelihood function between the best - fit value of @xmath45 and @xmath44 . maximum likelihood fitting may not be the best method for finding clusters with arbitrary shape , but theoretically it is the best one for the vast majority of clusters having regular shape .",
    "based on the considerations above , we implemented an algorithm for detection of extended sources which uses our own variant of wavelet transform analysis , wavelet decomposition , to find all sources even in the presence of source confusion and maximum likelihood fitting of @xmath39-models to determine whether each source is extended .",
    "each step is discussed below in detail .",
    "cluster detection in the pspc images is complicated by the varying background and confusion with point sources located in the vicinity of clusters .",
    "the wavelet transform is well - suited to overcome these difficulties .",
    "we briefly outline the relevant properties of the wavelet transform and then describe our particular implementation .      the basic idea of the wavelet",
    "transform applied to astronomical images ( e.g.  grebenev et al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) is a convolution with a kernel which consists of a positive core and an outer negative ring , so that the integral of the kernel over the @xmath46 plane is zero .",
    "the convolution with such kernels allows complete background subtraction and isolation of structures of particular angular size .",
    "this can be shown using a kernel which is the difference of two gaussians : @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the convolution of this kernel with any linear function @xmath49 is zero .",
    "therefore , any slowly varying background which can be locally approximated by a linear function is subtracted by a convolution with this kernel . to demonstrate the ability of wavelets to reveal structures with a given size , consider the convolution of the wavelet kernel with a gaussian @xmath50 .",
    "the convolution amplitude achieves its maximum when @xmath51 but rapidly falls to @xmath52 of the maximum for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "these properties of the wavelet transform are used for source detection ( e.g. , damiani et al .",
    "1997 ) . in most applications",
    ", an image is convolved with a family of kernels of the same functional form while varying its scale ( @xmath55 in eq .",
    "[ eq : gausswv ] ) .",
    "sources are detected as significant local maxima in the convolved images .",
    "information about the source angular extent can be derived from the wavelet transform values at different scales .",
    "this simple approach works well for detection of isolated sources , but fails if another bright source is located nearby , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wvdecomp]a , b . a point source with a flux four times that of the cluster",
    "is located at @xmath56 core - radii from the cluster center ( _ a _ ) .",
    "the image is convolved with the wavelet kernels ( eq.[eq : gausswv ] ) of scale @xmath57 pixels ( _ b _ ) . at each scale",
    ", the point source dominates the convolution , and the cluster remains undetected .",
    "a different kind of complication for a simple wavelet analysis is caused by compact groups of point sources .",
    "convolved with a wide kernel , such groups appear as a single extended source , resulting in false cluster detections .",
    "neither of these problems can be overcome by using a different symmetric wavelet kernel with compact support ( strag & nguyen 1995 ) .",
    "however , they can be overcome using the idea employed in the clean algorithm commonly applied in radio astronomy ( hgbom 1974 ) : point sources are detected first and subtracted from the image before the detection of extended sources .",
    "below we describe our algorithm , which we call wavelet decomposition , which combines this approach with wavelet transform analysis .",
    "the family of wavelet kernels we use is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : wdfamily ] , in which we use several combinations of @xmath55 and @xmath58 which we call scales . at scale 1 , the positive component in eq.[eq : wdfamily ] is a @xmath43-function ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath60  pixel . at scale 2 ,",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 pixels , at scale 3 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 pixels and so on . at the largest scale @xmath65 ,",
    "the kernel is a single , positive gaussian with @xmath66 pixels . how close is this family of kernels to the optimal filter for detecting sources with the @xmath39-model surface brightness profiles ?",
    "numerical calculations show that in at least one of the scales , the signal - to - noise ratio exceeds 80% of the maximum value corresponding to the optimal filter  the @xmath39-model itself  for @xmath67 .",
    "the described family of wavelet kernels has the advantage of an easy and linear back - transformation .",
    "the original image @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the convolution with the kernel of scale @xmath71 .",
    "an important interpretation of this wavelet transform follows from this equation : it provides a decomposition of an image into a sum of components of different characteristic sizes . with this interpretation",
    ", we construct the following iterative scheme to remove the effect of point sources .",
    "we convolved the image with a kernel of the smallest scale , estimated the detection threshold as described below , and cleaned the image of noise .",
    "the convolved image values were preserved in those regions where the brightness exceeded @xmath52 of the detection threshold and which contained at least one maximum above the detection threshold .",
    "the remaining image was set to zero .",
    "we subtracted this cleaned image from the input image to remove the sources that have been detected at this step , and repeated the convolution and cleaning procedure iteratively until no more sources were detected at this scale .",
    "we also added cleaned images obtained at each iteration to produce a composite image of significant sources detected at this scale .",
    "we then moved to the next scale , at which the input image was set to the original image minus everything detected at the first scale .",
    "the iterations were stoped at scale 6 , for which @xmath72 and @xmath73 and detected sources have typical full widths of 34 .    the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : wvdecomp ] illustrate this procedure .",
    "the smallest wavelet kernel is insensitive to the broad cluster emission and detects only the point source .",
    "when iterations at scale 1 are completed , @xmath74 of the point source flux has been subtracted .",
    "subtraction of the point source continues at scales 2 and 3 , while the cluster remains undetected because it is broader than the analyzing kernel .",
    "the point source is almost completely subtracted at small scales and does not interfere with cluster detection at scales 46 .",
    "the result of these iterations is a set of images containing statistically significant structures detected at each scale , whose characteristic size corresponds to the width of the analyzing kernel at this scale .",
    "therefore , to separate point and extended sources , one can combine small and large scales , respectively . as fig .",
    "[ fig : wvdecomp]d shows , the sum of scales 13 and 46 provides almost perfect separation of the original image into the point source and the cluster .",
    "it is important to choose the correct detection thresholds .",
    "although several analytic methods of deriving detection thresholds for the wavelet transform were suggested ( starck & pierre 1998 and references therein ) , we determined them through monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we simulated @xmath75 images consisting of a flat poisson background and convolved them with the wavelet kernels .",
    "the distribution of the local maxima in the convolved images was used to define the detection threshold .",
    "we set this threshold at that value above which one expects to find on average @xmath76 local maximum per simulated background image per scale in the absence of real sources , so that in the combined scales 46 we expect one false detection per image .",
    "thus defined , detection thresholds correspond to a formal significance of @xmath77 .",
    "detection thresholds were tabulated for a grid of simulated background intensities . in the analysis of real images , we estimated the local background and found the detection threshold by interpolation over the precalculated grid .",
    "detection thresholds were deliberately set low , allowing approximately 600 false detections in the entire survey , since our goal at this step was to detect all possible candidates for the subsequent maximum likelihood fitting , where the final decision about source significance and extent is made .         -2.5ex",
    "-2.5ex    -1.5ex    as a result of the wavelet decomposition , we obtain six images which contain detected sources of characteristic size ( fwhm ) approximately @xmath78 ( scales 1 through 6 ) .",
    "we use these images to select candidate extended sources for subsequent modeling .",
    "since the fwhm of the psf is 25  on - axis , most point sources are detected on scales 13 and are absent at scales 46 .",
    "on the other hand , a distant cluster with core radius of 250  kpc at @xmath79 has an angular radius of 35  ( equivalent to @xmath80 fwhm ) and hence is detected at scales 46 , to which point sources do not contribute .",
    "even clusters with smaller core radii , @xmath81 , would be detected at scale 4 , because their surface brightness profiles become broader than @xmath82 fwhm when blurred by the psf .",
    "therefore , cluster candidates can be selected as sources detected at scale 4 or higher .",
    "some point sources , especially those at large off - axis angles where the angular resolution degrades , are detected at scale 4 .",
    "this shows that our cluster candidate selection based on the wavelet decomposition is lenient , and we are unlikely to miss any real clusters at this step .",
    "the next step is the maximum likelihood fitting of selected candidate extended sources to determine the significance of their extent and existence , which will be used for the final cluster selection .",
    "the procedure is straightforward for isolated extended sources .",
    "the photon image is fit by a model which consists of the @xmath39-model convolved with the psf .",
    "source position , core - radius , and total flux are free parameters , while @xmath39 is fixed at a value of @xmath56 .",
    "the model also includes the fixed background taken from the map calculated as described in ",
    "[ sec : bg ] .",
    "the psf is calculated at the appropriate off - axis angle for a typical source spectrum in the 0.62 kev energy band ( hasinger et al.1993b ) .",
    "the best fit parameters are found by minimizing @xmath83 ( cash 1979 ) : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the number of photons in the data and the model in pixel @xmath87 , respectively , and the sum is over all pixels in the fitted region .",
    "note that @xmath86 includes background , so @xmath83 is defined even if the source flux is set to zero . along with best - fit parameters we determine the formal significances of source existence and extent .",
    "the significance of source existence is found from the change in @xmath83 resulting from fixing the source flux at zero ( cash 1979 ) .",
    "similarly , the significance of the source extent is found by fixing the core - radius at zero and re - fitting the source position and flux .",
    "point sources in the vicinity of the extended source must be included in the fit .",
    "we use local maxima in the combined wavelet scales 13 to create the list of point sources . for the fitting ,",
    "point sources are modeled as the psf calculated for a typical source spectrum as a function of off - axis angle .",
    "point source fluxes are free parameters , but their positions are fixed , because they are accurately determined by the wavelet decomposition . the fitting procedure is analogous to that for isolated extended sources .",
    "as was discussed above , some point sources are detected at scale 4 , and therefore we initially fit them as extended sources , i.e.  by the @xmath39-model with free core - radius and position .",
    "the best fit core radii for such sources are small and consistent with zero , so they are not included in the final catalog .",
    "however , these sources may interfere with the determination of significance of source extent .",
    "suppose that a faint point source is located next to a bright cluster , and that the point source is fitted by the @xmath39-model with free position",
    ". the best fit core - radius of the point source component will be close to zero . to estimate the significance of the cluster extent",
    ", we set the core - radius of the cluster component to zero and refit all other parameters , including source positions . in this case",
    "the best fit model will consist of the former cluster component at the position of the point source and the former point source component at the position of the cluster having non - zero core radius . the net change of @xmath83 will be zero and we will conclude that the cluster component is not significantly extended . to overcome this interference",
    ", we update source lists after the first fitting . those extended sources which have best fit",
    "core radii @xmath88 are removed from the list of extended sources and added to the list of point sources .",
    "parameters of the remaining extended sources are then refitted .",
    "next , we make the final selection of extended sources .    1 .",
    "the main requirement is that the source must be real and significantly extended . for this",
    ", we require that the formal significance of the source existence must exceed @xmath89 and the significance of its extent must be greater than @xmath90 .    2 .",
    "we find , however , that because of the non - linearity of the model , the formal significance of the source extent is often overestimated for faint sources on top of the very low background .",
    "to exclude these cases , we required that the total source flux must exceed 25 photons .",
    "some bright sources have a small but significant intrinsic extent .",
    "an example is a bright galactic star with a very soft spectrum .",
    "its image is slightly broader than the psf for hard point sources because the psf is broader at low energies and the stars have a larger proportion of soft photons . to exclude such cases",
    ", we required that the source core - radius must be greater that 1/4 of the fwhm of the psf .",
    "this requirement is met automatically for faint clusters , because faint sources with small core radii can not be significantly extended , i.e.  can not satisfy condition ( 1 ) .",
    "this third criterion sets the lower limit of 6.25  for core - radii of clusters in our catalog .",
    "even at @xmath18 , this angle corresponds to 50 kpc .",
    "4 .  finally , one has to exclude sources associated with the target of observation , as well as sources detected at large off - axis angles where psf degradation makes detection of the source extent uncertain .",
    "our last requirement was that the source is at least 2  from the target of the observation and at off - axis angle smaller than 17.5 .",
    "sources satisfying criteria 14 comprise the final catalog .",
    "-1.5ex      to minimize computations , we fit the data only in those regions where the sum of scales 16 is positive , i.e.  where an excess over the background is found by the wavelet decomposition . to improve the computational efficiency still further",
    ", the image is split into connected domains .",
    "sources located within the same domain are fit simultaneously .",
    "the whole procedure of the extended source detection is illustrated in fig  [ fig : example ] .",

    "the wavelet decomposition detects 97 sources in this field .",

    "all four of them are optically confirmed clusters .",
    "note that the number of candidate extended sources found by the wavelet decomposition is more than 3 times the number of finally selected clusters .",
    "thus , the selection of candidate sources by the wavelet analysis is rather lenient and does not miss real extended sources .    using the detection procedure described in this section , we selected 239 significantly extended x - ray sources in 647 fields . in the following sections we describe the measurement of their x - ray parameters , optical observations , and present our final catalog .",
    "for each detected cluster , we derive its position , radius , total x - ray flux , and their uncertainties .",

    "cluster position is measured as the best - fit centroid of the @xmath39-model .",
    "in addition to the statistical uncertainty of the position , there is a systematic uncertainty due to inaccuracy of the aspect solution .",

    ", we examined the positional correspondence of x - ray sources and objects in the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "if possible , targets of observations or other prominent sources ( galaxies or bright stars ) were used to find the precise coordinate correction .",

    "if no optical counterparts of x - ray sources were found in the dss , we assigned a systematic position error of 17 , the _ rms _ value of shifts measured using targets of observation . in some observations without a bright target , we found a correlation between fainter x - ray and optical sources , and measured shifts from this correlation .",
    "we regarded this shift measurement as less reliable than that using targets , and assigned an intermediate systematic error of 10  to the cluster position in such fields .",

    "we did not correct for the rotation , but simply added @xmath92 in quadrature to the offset uncertainty .",
    "the final position error listed in table  [ tab : catalog ] is the sum of systematic and statistical errors in quadrature",
    ".      since it is impossible to fit the @xmath39-parameter using our data , we measure core - radius for fixed @xmath93 and refer to this value as the effective cluster radius @xmath94 .",
    "effective radius can be also defined as the radius at which the surface brightness falls by a factor of @xmath95 and hence is a physically meaningful combination of core - radius and @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath94 measurement by fitting a @xmath93 model is accurate to @xmath96 within the observed range of @xmath39 , @xmath97 ( jones & forman 1998 ) .",
    "we will now show that the radius measurement is relatively insensitive to the presence of cooling flows which cause a surface brightness excess in the central region of the cluster ( e.g. fabian 1994 ) .",
    "cooling flow clusters in general can not be fit by the @xmath39-model .",
    "however , in distant clusters , the cenral excess is completely removed by the psf blurring , and cooling flows simply reduce the core - radius value . to study the possible influence of the cooling flow on the derived effective radii",
    ", we use the pspc image of abell  2199 , a nearby cluster with a moderate cooling flow of @xmath98yr@xmath3 ( edge et al .",
    "the @xmath39-model fit for all radii yields @xmath99 , @xmath100kpc . if the inner 200  kpc region is excluded to remove the cooling flow contamination , the best - fit parameters are @xmath101 , @xmath102kpc , which corresponds to an effective radius of @xmath103kpc .",
    "we then determine the radius value which we would measure if a2199 were located at @xmath104 .",
    "at this redshift , the fwhm of the psf corresponds to @xmath105  kpc .",
    "we convolve the image with this `` psf '' and fit accounting for the smoothing and without exclusion of the center .",
    "the best fit parameters for the smoothed data are @xmath106 , @xmath107kpc .",
    "fixing @xmath93 , as we do for the analysis of distant clusters , we obtain @xmath108  kpc , only 22% smaller than the true value obtained by excluding the cooling flow .",
    "the surface brightness of most of detected extended sources significantly exceeds the background only in a very limited area near the source center .",
    "therefore , the total source flux simply integrated in a wide aperture has unacceptably large statistical uncertainty . to overcome this ,",
    "the flux is usually directly measured within some small aperture , and then extrapolated to infinity using a reasonable model of the surface brightness profile ( henry et al .",
    "1992 , nichol et al .",
    "1997 , scharf et al .",
    "similarly to this approach , we derived total fluxes from the normalization of the best fit @xmath39-model .",
    "the most serious problem with the flux measurement using such limited aperture photometry is the necessity to extrapolate the observed flux to infinity .",
    "this extrapolation is a potential source of large systematic errors because the surface brightness distribution at large radii is unknown .",
    "for example , consider the flux extrapolation from the inner 2.5 core radius region using @xmath39-models with different @xmath39 .",
    "this inner region contains 49% of the total flux if @xmath109 , 64% if @xmath93 , and 70% if @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , assuming @xmath93 one underestimates the flux by @xmath111 if in fact @xmath109 , the median value in the jones & forman ( 1998 ) sample .",
    "in addition , a trend of @xmath39 with cluster redshift or luminosity will introduce systematic changes within the sample .",
    "for example , jones & forman find that lower luminosity clusters have smaller @xmath39 , which might result in underestimation of their fluxes .    to address the issue of systematic flux errors in more detail , we have used simulated realistic data (  [ sec : simulations ] ) to estimate the effect of the assumed value of @xmath39 on the cluster flux determination .",
    "clusters were fit as described in ",
    "[ sec : ml ] , but for three different values of @xmath39 , 0.6 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "dashed lines in fig  [ fig : fluxbias ] show average ratios of the measured and input total flux as a function of the true @xmath39 , if the flux is measured as a normalization of the best - fit model with @xmath39 fixed at 0.6 and 0.7 . in all cases",
    "significant biases are present over the observed range of @xmath39 ( jones & forman 1998 ; shaded region ) .",
    "we are interested in a flux measure which has the smallest uncertainty for the whole range of @xmath39 , not the one which yields an unbiased flux estimate for some fixed value of @xmath39 .",
    "the quantity @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are cluster fluxes calculated assuming @xmath109 and @xmath113 , respectively , is close to the desired flux measure ( solid line in fig  [ fig : fluxbias ] ) .",
    "it provides a satisfactory flux estimate , accurate to @xmath117 over the observed range of @xmath39 .",
    "we use this quantity to measure cluster fluxes throughout the rest of this paper , and add the systematic error of @xmath118 to the statistical uncertainty in the flux .    [",

    "cluster radius is simulated from the distribution corresponding to the simulated luminosity .",
    "we then calculate the observed angular radius and flux accounting for the correlation between x - ray luminosity and temperature ( e.g. , david et al.1993 ) , the probability to detect this cluster (  [ sec : detprob ] ) , and finally we simulate the measured flux (  [ sec : measscat ] ) .",
    "the detection probability is added to the distribution of detected clusters as a function of measured flux , and 1 is added to the the number of input clusters in the corresponding bin of real flux . simulating @xmath123 clusters according to this procedure , we determine the sky coverage as the ratio of detected and input sources in the corresponding flux bins .",
    "the calculated survey area is shown in table  [ tab : area ] . in this table",
    "we also show the sky coverage for the distant , @xmath6 , subsample .",
    "the sky coverage for distant subsamples differs from that for the entire sample because of the different distribution of angular sizes .",
    "using different cluster evolution models ( including evolution of luminosities , number density , and radii ) , we verified that the derived sky coverage varies by no more than @xmath118 compared to the no - evolution assumption , if cluster radii do not evolve . using the present cluster sample , vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show that the distribution of sizes of distant and nearby clusters is indeed very similar .        -2.5ex",

    "finally , the extrapolation of our @xmath9 relation down to @xmath125 , agrees with results of mchardy et al.(1997 ) , who identified most of the x - ray sources , regardless of extent , in their ultra - deep survey .",
    "our @xmath9 relation seems to be systematically higher than the surface density of clusters identified in the 50  deg@xmath10 survey of rosati et al .",
