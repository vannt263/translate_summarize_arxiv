    "ramsey theory refers to a large body of deep results in mathematics whose underlying philosophy is captured succinctly by the statement that `` every large system contains a large well - organized subsystem . ''",
    "this is an area in which a great variety of techniques from many branches of mathematics are used and whose results are important not only to combinatorics but also to logic , analysis , number theory and geometry .",
    "one of the pillars of ramsey theory , from which many other results follow , is the hales  jewett theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem may be thought of as a statement about multidimensional multiplayer tic - tac - toe , saying that in a high enough dimension one of the players must win .",
    "however , this fails to capture the importance of the result , which easily implies van der waerden s theorem on arithmetic progressions in colorings of the integers and its multidimensional generalizations . to quote @xcite ,",
    " the hales ",
    "jewett theorem strips van der waerden s theorem of its unessential elements and reveals the heart of ramsey theory .",

    "the original proof of the hales ",
    "jewett theorem is similar to that of van der waerden s theorem , using a double induction , where we prove the theorem for alphabet @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath1 colors by using the statement for alphabet @xmath4 $ ] and a much larger number of colors .",
    "this results in bounds of ackermann type for the dependence of the dimension @xmath2 on the size of the alphabet @xmath16 . in the late eighties ,",
    "shelah @xcite made a major breakthrough by finding a way to avoid the double induction and prove the theorem with primitive recursive bounds .",
    "this also resulted in the first primitive recursive bounds for van der waerden s theorem ( since drastically improved by gowers @xcite ) .",
    "shelah s proof relied in a crucial way on a lemma now known as the shelah cube lemma .",
    "the simplest case of this lemma says that if we color the edges of the cartesian product @xmath0 in @xmath1 colors then , for @xmath2 sufficiently large , there is a rectangle with both pairs of opposite edges receiving the same color .",
    "shelah s proof shows that we may take @xmath18 . in the second edition of their book on ramsey theory @xcite , graham ,",

    "gyrfs proved that @xmath102 , which in turn implies that @xmath96 is polynomial in @xmath2 for any @xmath103 .",
