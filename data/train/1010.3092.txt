    "the profile is the set or sequence of numbers of nodes at each level of a tree .",
    "it is a fine tree shaped parameter related to many other important shape characteristics such as the total path length ( the sum of the distances of all nodes to the root ) , depth ( the distance of a random node to the root ) , height ( the maximal distance of a node to the root ) , saturation level ( the minimal distance of an external node to the root ) and width ( number of nodes at the most abundant level ) .    in general , we distinguish between two main groups of trees . in the first group",
    "we collect all the trees by their height which increases through the square root of the number of nodes .",
    "the prime examples of these kind of trees are galton ",
    "watson trees conditioned on the total progeny or simply generated trees .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the simply generated trees studied by @xcite and conditioned galton  watson trees are the same . moreover , the profile of conditioned galton ",
    "watson trees is further investigated in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite with further references .    in the second group",
    "we collect all the trees with logarithmically growing height .",
    "in contrast to conditioned galton  watson trees , the profiles of these trees have received less attention in the past .",
    "however , there has been much done on this topic in the last few years .",
    "the methods used to derive limit theorems for normalized profiles range from the method of moments , the contraction method to analytical tools , including saddlepoint methods , mellin transforms , poissonization , de - poissonization , singularity analysis , application of generating functions and uniform asymptotic analysis .",
    "we refer to @xcite , drmota and hwang ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and chauvin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used martingale methods to obtain limit theorems for the profile of the random binary search tree .",
    "it is a classical result of @xcite that the profile - polynom of the binary search tree , @xmath1 , is a discrete time martingale where @xmath2 denotes the number of nodes in generation @xmath3 of a random binary search tree of size @xmath4 [ cf .",
    "( [ equ_l(n ) ] ) ] and @xmath5 is a normalizing deterministic constant for @xmath6 fixed [ see ( [ eqc_n ] ) for a definition ] . with this in mind ,",
    "classical martingale convergence results may now be applied to investigate the ( asymptotic ) behavior of this martingale and the asymptotics of the profile of the binary search tree [ see @xcite ] .",
    "instead of analyzing @xmath7 directly , @xcite showed that the discrete time martingale @xmath7 is deeply related to the well - studied classical yule - time martingale @xmath8 of the corresponding continuous time tree , the yule tree [ cf .",
    "( [ m(t , z ) ] ) ] .",
    "finally , they strengthened classical convergence results in order to relate the uniform convergence of @xmath8 in compact sets to corresponding uniform asymptotic results of @xmath7 .",
    "apart from the profile of the binary search tree , the profile of the random recursive tree has been studied with martingale methods [ cf .",
    "drmota and hwang ( @xcite ) showed that the profile is not concentrated around the mean .",
    "their proof is based on showing that the variance undergoes four phase transitions and exhibits a bimodal behavior in contrast to the unimodality of the expected value of the profiles . as a consequence ,",
    "the profile is not concentrated around the mean .",
    "for example , around the most numerous level ( where the width is attained ) the variance is small [ @xmath9 and the profile is concentrated with a gaussian limit , but @xmath10 away from this level the variance increases , and there is no concentration anymore [ cf .",
    "drmota and hwang ( @xcite ) , and further remarks in example [ ex3.3.2 ] ] .",
    "recently , @xcite used the martingale method of @xcite to show a limit theorem for the profile of plane oriented recursive trees .",
    "obviously not all trees have a martingale structure , and , furthermore , the method rapidly becomes costly when we leave the well - known binary search tree and recursive tree cases .",
    "the last statement is based on the fact that corresponding statements about other trees , and especially their continuous time matches , are not available which differs from assertions about the well - studied yule tree process .",
    "however , there is a large class of trees for which the martingale method gives uniform convergence results for the profile in any suitable compact set . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the kind of trees that can be studied with martingale methods .",
    "we want to find out how the method of @xcite can be generalized to derive asymptotic results for other trees besides the ones that have been studied so far .",
    "@xcite constructed a class of continuous time edge - weighted trees and proved , using large deviation techniques , a general law of large numbers for the height of these trees .",
    "this class of edge - weighted trees leads , when the tree process is stopped correctly , to various well - known discrete time trees as , for example , to random binary search trees and to random recursive trees .",
    "the initial point of their model is the construction of an infinite , @xmath0-ary tree where each node @xmath11 in that tree is assigned , independently , a random vector , @xmath12 where , for instance , @xmath13 is the lifetime of @xmath11 s @xmath14th child , and @xmath15 is a specific weight assigned to the @xmath14th child of @xmath11 [ cf . ( [ vector ] ) ] .",
    "let exp@xmath16 denote the exponential distribution with the first moment equal to @xmath17 , in other words , the distribution with lebesgue density @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "a continuous time tree process is markovian with a classical martingale structure if and only if the lifetimes are independent of each other and exponentially distributed ( see , e.g. , harris [ ( @xcite ) , chapter v.2 ] , @xcite , @xcite , athreya and ney [ ( @xcite ) , chapter iii ] , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "essentially , this follows from the memoryless property of the exponential distribution .",
    "our purpose is now to show that these trees have the right martingale properties in order to generalize the method of @xcite . the main theorem of this paper , theorem [ theo2.3.9 ] , states that the normalized profile of a @xmath0-ary weighted tree converges almost surely to a limit as the number of nodes in the tree tends to infinity .",
    "this limit can be identified as the almost sure limit of a discrete time martingale and , also , as the unique solution of expectation one of a fixed point equation .",
    "the plan for the rest of the paper is the following : first , in section [ section6.1 ] we will introduce the tree model of @xcite and define a closely related branching markov process .",
    "second , in section [ section6.2 ] we will define the corresponding continuous time martingale associated with the branching markov process of section [ section6.1 ] and its discrete time analog in section [ section6.3 ] .",
    "next , in section [ section6.4 ] we will elaborate the relationship between those two martingales and formulate our main result , theorem [ theo2.3.9 ] in section [ section6.5 ] .",
    "finally , in section [ section6.6 ] we will show the applicability of our main theorem [ theo2.3.9 ] based on some examples as , for instance , the well - known random binary search tree , the random recursive tree , random lopsided trees and random plane oriented trees .",
    "in this section we describe the tree model of @xcite .",

    "every node @xmath11 has children denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "generally , if @xmath25 is a node , and @xmath26 is a sequence with @xmath27 , we set @xmath28 and call @xmath11 an ancestor of @xmath29 .    for each node",

    "each couple @xmath33 is distributed as @xmath34 for independent @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that the lifetime @xmath13 is independent of @xmath37 for different @xmath11 and @xmath38 or different @xmath14 and  @xmath39 .",
    "all @xmath36 s are independent of any @xmath35 s , but we allow dependence of @xmath40 for any node @xmath11 in the tree @xmath41 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath36 is exponentially distributed with mean one to ensure markov properties and that @xmath35 is a lattice distribution with values in @xmath42 for some @xmath43 .",
    "in @xcite it is assumed that @xmath36 and @xmath35 are nonnegative independent random variables where @xmath36 is not mono - atomic , has no atom at zero and the following property holds : @xmath44 as mentioned in their concluding remark , their model and their proof of the law of large numbers for the height can be extended to more general cases allowing dependence of @xmath36 and @xmath35 as well as multi - dimensional versions . in @xcite",
    "the assumption that the components of the random vectors attained to each node are independent is skipped in order to obtain further height results of , for example , pebbled trees and others .",
    "let @xmath45 be the set of edges from the root to node @xmath11 .",

    "this initial ancestor dies at a random time @xmath59 where @xmath59 is exponentially distributed with mean one and bears @xmath0 children .",

    "@xmath62 the corresponding individual deceases and gives birth to @xmath0 new individuals , namely its children . because of the memoryless property of the exponential distribution , all individuals alive just after @xmath63 ( namely the @xmath64 remaining children of the root and the @xmath0 children of the root s child that deceased at time @xmath63 ) behave similarly to and independently from each other , having an exponentially distributed lifetime .",
    "we define @xmath65 as the tree corresponding to the process described above when it is stopped at time @xmath66 .",
