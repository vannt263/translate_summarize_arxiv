    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) consist of a neutron star or a black hole that accretes matter from a ( sub- ) solar mass companion star that overflows its roche lobe .",
    "the accretion process involves the formation of an accretion disk and typically generates a 0.510 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which places lmxbs amongst the brightest x - ray point sources in our galaxy .",
    "many lmxbs have an unstable accretion disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typically , the active phases of transient lmxbs last for a few weeks or months , while they reside in quiescence for years before a new outburst commences .",
    "whereas it is not straightforward to distinguish the nature of the compact object from the x - ray spectral and timing properties of the outburst ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are two phenomena that require a solid surface and are therefore considered a distinctive property of accreting neutron stars .",
    "these are coherent x - ray pulsations and thermonuclear x - ray bursts ( i.e. , type - i x - ray bursts , x - ray bursts hereafter ) .",
    "x - ray bursts are bright flashes of x - ray emission that may reach up to the eddington limit and temporarily outshine the accretion luminosity .",
    "they are caused by unstable burning of accreted helium ( he ) and/or hydrogen ( h ) on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "x - ray bursts are characterized by blackbody emission that peaks at a temperature up to @xmath10  kev and decays to @xmath11  kev as the x - ray burst fades .",
    "the observable properties such as the duration ( @xmath12 ) , radiated energy ( @xmath13 ) , and recurrence time ( @xmath14 ) depend on the amount and composition of the fuel that is consumed during the x - ray burst .",
    "the most commonly observed x - ray bursts last for @xmath15  s , have a radiated energy output of @xmath16  erg , and recur on a timescale of minutes to days . to date , thousands of such events have been observed from about @xmath17 different lmxbs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "apart from these _ normal _ x - ray bursts , there are two classes of more energetic events that are also more rare : intermediately long x - ray bursts ( @xmath18 tens of minutes to hours , @xmath19  erg , and @xmath20 weeks to years ; see * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the total duration of @xmath0  minutes and estimated energy output of @xmath1  erg , fall in between that of normal and intermediately long x - ray bursts . from the observed peaks of the x - ray bursts , we estimate a distance of @xmath2  kpc for swift j185003.2005627  and @xmath3  kpc for swift j1922.71716 . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the outburst and quiescent x - ray properties of the two sources . </S>",

    "<S> swift j185003.2005627  returned to quiescence @xmath6  d after its bat trigger , while swift j1922.71716  appears to exhibit long accretion outbursts that last several months to years . </S>",
