    "it is well known that gravitational waves ( gws ) can interact with electromagnetic waves . the scattering of electromagnetic waves by time dependent gws has also been considered by several authors ( dewitt & breheme 1960 ; cooperstock 1968 ; chestrs , 1973 ; denisov 1978 ; grischuk & polnarev 1980 ; macdonald & thorne 1982 ; machedo & nelson 1983 ; demianski 1983 ; marklund et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it has been shown that the coupling is mainly due to the generation of electric currents inside the plasma by the perturbation of the charged particle trajectories by the gw .",
    "several studies used the kinetic theory formulation to study the coupling of gws with electromagnetic waves in a magnetized vacuum ( gertsenshtein 1962 ; zeldovich 1974 ) or near a charged black hole ( gerlach 1974 ) . the first attempt to study the propagation of gws in a magnetized plasma using",
    "the kinetic theory was by macedo and nelson ( 1983 ) .",
    "they studied the coupling of gws propagating parallel and perpendicular to the external magnetic field with high - frequency electromagnetic modes .",
    "the coupling of the gravitational with the high - frequency electromagnetic modes propagating along the magnetic field was weak .",
    "this is due to the fact that the gw propagating along the direction of the undisturbed magnetic field does not generate currents in the plasma .",
    "the coupling is substantially higher for ordinary and extraordinary waves propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field but the energy transfer of gravitational energy to electromagnetic energy in the interstellar space is extremely weak .",
    "brodin & marklund ( 1999 ) discuss the parametric excitation of plasma waves in the presence of gravitational radiation .",
    "they assumed that the gw was a monochromatic wave and estimated , using einstein - maxwell - vlasov s equations , the growth of langmuir and electromagnetic waves in a cold unmagnetized plasma .",

    "they showed that , close to a strong gravitational source , the electric fields associated with the electrostatic waves can reach appreciable levels .",
    "the direct escape of plasma radiation is not possible without a non - linear conversion ( see brodin et al .",

    "we outline the basic equations , in section 3 we derive the general dispersion relation for the coupling of the gws with the mhd waves and in section 4 the dispersion relation for the coupling of the gravitational with ambient magnetosonic waves . in section 5",

    "for such a plasma , the interaction length can be up to several thousand times larger than @xmath89 , a more stringent limit on the interaction length will probably be set but factors such as the non - uniformity of the magnetic field and the plasma density with distance from the source .",
    "assuming also a small imaginary part for the frequency and substituting @xmath91 in eq.(14 ) , developing @xmath92 , and using the plemelj formula ( @xmath93 ) we finally arrive at the spatial dependence of the amplitude of the energy density _ 0 ( n - n_g ) h_0 h^2 c k e^-i ( k ) z , where @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96    the magnetic field amplitude is estimated with the use of the perturbed maxwell s equations ( 6 ) and with the aid of eq.(10 ) h_0 ( n - n_g ) h_0h c k e^-i k z. we note that , the amplitude of the fast magnetosonic wave is proportional to the gw amplitude . in a tenuous and hot plasma , @xmath97 , so that the mismatch @xmath98 and our treatment applies . as a result",
    "the amplitude of the msw grows after having traveled a distance equal to a half beat between the wave numbers , and would decline again further out in the absence of dissipation . in a relativistic electron positron plasma",
    "the latter is , however , unlikely and some observational effects can be expected .",
    "we have found that , to first order , a gw , propagating along the magnetic field in a uniform and ideal plasma , does not couple with an alfvn wave ( aw ) whereas a gw , propagating across the magnetic field , does couple with a msw .",
    "this can be easily be understood as follows .    in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we have sketched the effect of a large - amplitude gw traveling _ along _ an , initially uniform , magnetic field embedded in an ideal plasma . at first sight it is surprising that the gw would not be able to excite an aw as the perturbed magnetic field shows clear distortions which in an ordinary magnetoplasma would be expected to generate aws . however , the point is that the energy of an aw with amplitude @xmath99 is proportional to @xmath100 whereas , for a msw , the magnetic part of the wave energy density is proportional to @xmath101 . as a result ,",
    "the energy in the aw is of higher order in the perturbation as compared to the magnetosonic case .",
    "therefore , our first order calculation should not lead to the excitation of aws , as indeed we have found . on the other hand",
    ", we do expect such a coupling to show up in a higher - order calculation , and such a coupling will be relevant in case the gw is non - linear .    in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we have sketched the effect of a gw traveling at right angles to an initially uniform magnetic field frozen into an ideal plasma . clearly , the field is periodically compressed by the gw although the differential motions induced by the gw are divergence - free ! at the same time , the ambient uniform magnetic field remains uniform and straight and does not become bent . as a result",
    ", no aw excitation is expected to occur by the gw even to higher order .",
    "further , our result that the coupling between a gw and msws vanishes as soon as the dispersion relations for both wave modes coincide exactly , can be understood as follows .",
    "an effective transfer of energy from one wave mode to the other either requires that there is some dissipation ( weber 1960 ; esposito 1971 ) or , alternatively , that the signal speeds of both modes differ .",
    "if the plasma is both ideal and the group speeds of the wave modes coincide , there is no time lag during which some of the perturbed kinetic / magnetic plasma energy established by the gw can be fed into a magnetosonic wave . in a very general sense ,",
    "the changes brought about by the gw in the magnetoplasma are completely adiabatic and the periodic changes in the plasma completely reversible .",
    "all free energy in the magnetic field reverts back into the gw as it leaves the plasma again .",
    "a number of papers exist which discuss the interaction of msws with a plasma , e.g. coherent msw - particle interactions , cascading of long wave - length msws to short wavelengths and subsequent particle acceleration from turbulent diffusion ( see dermer at al .",
    "1996 ) , and finally the interaction of a relativistic magnetosonic shock wave with a positron - electron plasma ( hoshino et al . 1992 ) .",
    "thus , if a magnetosonic wave is driven by a gw , then it has the potential of producing additional interesting phenomena .",
    "a more detailed understanding of the linear and nonlinear evolution of the excited msws under the conditions of the particular gw source is needed . clearly , it is beyond the scope of the present study to model the acceleration and radiation properties of a gw - driven msw in the vicinity of a gw - source but we want to mention briefly two specific applications which have been the motivation for us to undertake this study : gws excited by star quakes or rotational instabilities in neutron stars ( see andersson , kokkotas & schutz 1999 ) or magnetars , and gws excited in merging neutron star binaries and their possible effects on gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .    in particular , we expect that the driving of msw by gravitational waves can become interesting near strongly - magnetized compact sources of high - frequency gws .",
    "the non - radial modes of relativistic stars produce gws with frequencies of the order of khz .",
    "these can be excited in several ways : in the core - collapse leading to the formation of a neutron star , several modes of pulsation can be excited to large amplitudes . in",
    "newly - born neutron stars the quadrupole @xmath102- and @xmath103-modes can become unstable to the emission of gravitational radiation , due to the cfs instability ( see stergioulas 1998 , andersson & kokkotas 2001 for recent reviews )",
    ". in the merger of two neutron stars , if a black hole is not formed promptly , the resulting merged object will emit large amplitude gws , due to the excitation of it s nonradial modes ( see shibata and uryu , 2001 ) .",
    "if strongly magnetized neutron stars ( magnetars ) exists , then the coupling of their secular spin - down with their very large magnetic field can lead to crust - fracturing and excitation of the quadrupole torsional mode in the crust of the star ( see duncan 1998 ) .",
    "in all the above cases , high - frequency gravitational waves travel through the magnetosphere of the compact object .",
    "in addition to gws emitted by normal - mode excitation in neutron stars , the main frequency of gws produced in the late stages of a neutron star binary inspiral is several hundred hz to a few khz ( see e.g. duez , baumgarte and shapiro 2000 ) .",
    "in such a case , however , the geometry of the magnetic field changes rapidly and this has to be taken into account .",
    "in this article we study for the first time the coupling of magnetosonic waves with gws . using the linearized general - relativistic hydromagnetic equations",
    ", we found the general dispersion relation for coupling of gw with the mhd waves .",
    "we showed that in the linear approximation only the fast magnetosonic waves will be coupled with the gw . we analyzed the linear dispersion relation for the gw - msw coupling , and found the relation between the amplitudes of the two waves , when they are in resonance .    in carrying out this study",
    "we have made several simplification : ( 1 ) we treat only one polarization for the gw ( see eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) , ( 2 ) the gw was treated as an external driver for the plasma , ( 3 ) we ignore non - linear terms and obliquely propagating waves .",
    "the above points , as well as the growth rate of driven msw waves for specific gw sources , will be discussed in future work .",
