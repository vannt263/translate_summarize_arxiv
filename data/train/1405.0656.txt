    "the b - mode polarization that can only be generated by the tensor modes has been observed by bicep2 group @xcite .",

    ", the tensor - to - scalar ratio is constrained to @xmath4 at @xmath5 level for the lensed-@xmath6cdm model , with @xmath7 disfavoured at @xmath8 level . with the help of this new constant on @xmath0 as well as that on the spectral index , some inflation models with prediction of negligible tensor perturbation have been excluded , such at the small - field inflation models .",
    "there is a tension between the observational results from bicep2 and the report of _",
    "planck_. according to the recent works from _ planck _",
    "@xcite , it gives @xmath9 and @xmath10 at @xmath11cl by combination of _ _ planck__+wp+highl data .",
    "however , when the running parameter defined as @xmath12 is included in the data fitting , it gives @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 at @xmath11cl by the same data . in a word , to give a consistent constraint on @xmath0 for the combination of _ _ planck__+wp+highl data and the bicep2 data , we require a running of the spectral index @xmath16 at @xmath11cl .",
    "on the other hand , inflation is the most economic way to solve the puzzles like the horizon problem in the hot big bang cosmology .",
    "it also generates a small quantum fluctuation that could be considered as the seed of the large - scale structure in the later time .",
    "the detection of b - mode from cmb by the bicep2 group also indicates a strong evidence of inflation @xcite . in a simplest slow - roll inflation model ,",
    "the early universe was driven by a single scalar field @xmath17 called the inflaton with a very flat potential @xmath18 .",
    "for example , in the so - called chaotic inflation @xcite , we have @xmath19 , while in the so - called natural inflation @xcite , we have @xmath20 . in these kind of single inflation models , the spectral index @xmath21 for the scalar perturbation deviates from the harrison - zeldovich value of unity in order of @xmath22 , and its running in order of @xmath23 .",
    "thus the explanation of large @xmath0 and @xmath24 is a challenge to single scalar field , see ref.@xcite for much detail discussions on this challenge .    also , in ref.@xcite the authors pointed out that it is difficult to achieve in common realisations of slow - roll inflation as it requires a large third field derivative while maintaining small first and second derivatives . usually , to give a stronger running of the spectral index ,",
    "a small number of e - folds @xmath25 is needed , e.g. @xmath26 contributes a factor @xmath27 to @xmath28 @xcite , see also ref.@xcite for the same conclusions .",
    "however , these discussion are all based on the assumption that the inflaton potential is expanded in the taylor series of the inflaton field with finite truncation . in this paper , in order to take up this challenge for the single inflation models , we propose a infinity power series potential for the inflaton , see eq.([equ : potential ] ) .",
    "we find that the absolute value ? ?",
    "the running of the spectral index is increasing while the tensor - to - scalar ratio becomes large . in the meanwhile , the number of e - folds is also big enough to solve the problems in big bang cosmology , say @xmath3 . and also it is proved that this kind of infinity power series potential is convergent when the parameters are located at some physical regions in the parameter space . in next section , we calculate the slow - roll parameters for this model and one can see that it indeed predict a large tensor - to - scalar ratio and the running of the spectral index , and we also confront this model with latest observations from _ planck _ and bicep2 .",
    "in last section , we will give some conclusions and discussions . the convergence proof and some coefficients of the potential are presented in the appendix.[app : pro ] and [ app : cof ] .",
    "for related works to realize a large running spectral index , see refs.@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we propose a single field inflation with the following power series potential in the units of @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a proportional constant , and we call it the infinity power series ( ips ) inflation model . here",
    "@xmath32 are nothing but some constant coefficients . since @xmath33 could be any finite values , we absorb it into the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "while for @xmath34 , it satisfies the following recurrence relation : @xmath35 a_k + 8a   ( k+1 ) ( n - k)(2n-2k-1)(n - k-1)a_{k+1 }   \\bigg\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are two parameters in this model , which can be determined by observations . by using the above recurrence relation ( [ equ : reca ] ) , one could get the value of @xmath32 for a given @xmath37 .",
    "we also present the values of @xmath32 for some leading terms of the potential in the app.[app : cof ] , in which it shows that the value of @xmath32 is decreasing with @xmath37 increased for a given parameter @xmath38 .",
    "such a kind of power series potential may be derived from some supergravity ( sugra ) theories : @xmath39\\ , , \\quad d_iw = \\partial_i w + ( \\partial_i k ) w\\,,\\ ] ] with the the following khler potential for example : @xmath40 which respects the shift symmetry to ensure the flatness of the potential beyond the planck scale along the imaginary components of @xmath41 , @xmath42 . here @xmath17 is identified to be the inflaton and @xmath43 is another chiral superfield .",
    "the superpotential is assumed to be of the general form @xmath44 see refs.@xcite for details on the sugra theory .",
    "the authors in refs.@xcite have considered so - called the polynomial inflation models with limited terms in the potential .",
    "notice that many forms of potential can be expanded as an infinity power series , e.g. an exponential potential @xmath45 can be written as @xmath46 .",
    "even a general potential can be expanded as taylor series . however , in the taylor series expansion , one can not control the infinity number of coefficients .",
    "the only way to deal with them seems to be firstly expanding the potential to only a few orders near the vicinity of the inflaton field , and then reconstructing the potential from observations , see refs.@xcite for examples . in the ips inflation model , there are only three parameters in the potential ( [ equ : potential ] ) , namely , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . furthermore , in the limit of @xmath49 or @xmath50 , one can recover the quadratic chaotic inflation model , since in this case @xmath51 for @xmath34 , namely @xmath52 .     left : the potential @xmath53 in eq.([equ : potential ] ) with different parameters @xmath36 .",

    "compare this potential from eq.([equ : potential ] ) with that in the chaotic inflation , e.g. @xmath55 or @xmath56 , we find that it could be almost identical to the quadratic one when @xmath17 is small , while it becomes larger than @xmath55 when @xmath17 goes large , but it is smaller than the quartic potential . furthermore , one can see that this kind of infinity power series potential is convergent in the physical regions of parameter spaces , which is required for an successful inflation , see appendix.[app : pro ] .",
