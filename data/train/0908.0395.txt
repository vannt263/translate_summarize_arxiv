    "gauge theories with the gauge groups @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are quite interesting as grand unified theory in particle physics , which would lead to the standard model at low energy .",
    "all of quarks and leptons are involved in the @xmath3 representations of @xmath4 and such a @xmath3 representation appears from the adjoint representation and @xmath5 representation of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , these representations are included in adjoint representations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these exceptional gauge theories can be derived in heterotic string theory , type iib string theory with non - perturbative effects and f - theory .",
    "indeed , interesting models have been studied e.g. in heterotic orbifold models @xcite and f - theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , extra dimensional field theories play an important role in particle phenomenology as well as cosmology .",
    "it is one of the most important issues how to realize a chiral spectrum in 4d effective field theory when we start with higher dimensional theory .",
    "one way to realize 4d chiral theory is to introduce non - trivial gauge backgrounds like magnetic fluxes . indeed ,",
    "several models with magnetic flux backgrounds have been studied in extra dimensional field theory and superstring theory  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , t - dual of magnetized d - brane models are intersecting d - brane models and within the latter framework a number of interesting models have been constructed@xcite .    the number of zero - modes , that is , the generation number , is determined by the magnitudes of magnetic fluxes .",
    "indeed , one of important aspects in magnetized extra dimensional fields is that one can solve analytically zero - mode equations on the torus with magnetic fluxes .",
    "their zero - mode profiles are non - trivially quasi - localized .",
    "such a behavior of zero - mode wavefunctions would be phenomenologically important .",
    "for example , when zero - mode profiles are quasi - localized far away each other , their couplings would be suppressed .",
    "that could explain small yukawa couplings for light quarks and leptons , and other couplings , which must be suppressed from the phenomenological viewpoint .",
    "at any rate , since we know zero - mode profiles explicitly , we can compute 4d effective theory concretely at least at the tree - level .",
    "( see for calculations of 4d effective couplings , e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "orbifolding is another way to realize 4d chiral spectra .",
    "one can also solve zero - mode equations on the orbifold with magnetic fluxes and compute 4d effective theory  @xcite .    at the perturbative level ,",
    "type ii string theory can realize @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 gauge groups , but not exceptional groups , although exceptional gauge theories could be realized non - perturbatively .",
    "thus , the former classes of gauge theories like @xmath6 have been studied mainly with the magnetic flux backgrounds . at any rate ,",
    "exceptional groups are quite interesting from the bottom - up phenomenological viewpoint .",
    "our purpose of this paper is to propose phenomenological model building from extra dimensional @xmath9 gauge theories with magnetic fluxes on the torus and orbifold backgrounds .",
    "our starting point is 10d super yang - mills theory with gauge groups @xmath9 .",
    "we compactify extra 6 dimensions on @xmath10 or the orbifold .",
    "then , we introduce magnetic fluxes in @xmath10 as well as wilson lines .",
    "these non - trivial gauge backgrounds , i.e. magnetic fluxes and wilson lines , with / without orbifolding would lead to interesting particle phenomenology . through this type of model building , we show some semi - realistic massless spectra and phenomenological interesting aspects .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",

    ", the following sum of magnetic fluxes @xmath219 appears @xmath222 moreover , the @xmath4 adjoint @xmath223 representation also include a @xmath218 representation and the corresponding matter field has the sum of magnetic fluxes @xmath219 , adjoint @xmath223 representation includes another @xmath224 representation but its @xmath153 charge is different . ] @xmath225 in the zero - mode equation . here",
    ", we require that all of @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 should be integers .",
    "similarly , we require that @xmath217 should be integers for all of matter fields with charges @xmath216 , which appear from the @xmath2 adjoint @xmath188 representation . by an explicit computation",
    ", it is found that the sum @xmath217 for any charge @xmath216 appearing from @xmath188 can be written as a linear combination of @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 with integer coefficients .",
    "thus , when all of @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 are integers , the sum @xmath217 for any charge @xmath216 of @xmath188 is always integer .    using the above notation",
    ", we introduce the magnetic fluxes such as , @xmath231 in addition , we also introduce all possible wilson lines on each torus along five @xmath151 directions . then , the gauge group is @xmath100 with @xmath151 factors .",
    "the 4d massless spectrum of this model includes the following matter fields under the standard gauge group , @xmath100 , @xmath232   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 8 \\left [ ( { \\bf 1},{\\bf 2})_{3}+ ( { \\bf 1},{\\bf 2})_{-3 } \\right ] \\\\ & & + 15 \\times   \\left [   ( { \\bf 3},{\\bf 1})_{4 } +    ( \\overline { \\bf 3},{\\bf 1})_{-4 } \\right ]   + 6 \\times   \\left [   ( { \\bf 3},{\\bf 1})_{-2 } +    ( \\overline { \\bf 3},{\\bf 1})_{2 } \\right ]   + 27 \\times   \\left [ ( { \\bf 1},{\\bf 1})_{6 }   + ( { \\bf 1},{\\bf 1})_{-6}\\right ] ,   \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath233 singlets with vanishing @xmath153 charges .",
    "that is , this massless spectrum includes three families of quarks and leptons as well as eight pairs of up- and down - sectors of electroweak higgs fields .",
    "in addition , many vector - like matter fields appear , but matter fields with exotic representations do not appear even in vector - like form .",
    "such exotic matter fields have ( effectively ) vanishing magnetic flux on one of @xmath31 . then , such fields become massive when we switch on proper wilson lines . thus , this model has semi - realistic massless spectrum , although the gauge sector still has 4d n=4 susy .",
    "we can write the wavefunctions of these zero - modes .",
    "for example , the zero - mode wavefunctions of left - handed quarks are written as @xmath234 for @xmath235 , where @xmath236 denote wilson lines along five @xmath151 directions .",
    "thus , the flavor structure for the left - handed quarks is determined by the third torus .",
    "similarly , we can write zero - mode wavefunctions of the other matter fields .",
    "the above massless spectrum includes several vector - like generations of right - handed quarks as well as right - handed leptons .",
    "these vector - like generations may gain mass terms .",
    "thus , the flavor structure of chiral right - handed quarks depends on mass matrices of vector - like generations .",
    "similarly , various models can be constructed within the framework of @xmath1 and @xmath2 models with magnetic flux and wilson line backgrounds .",
    "this type of model building would lead to quite interesting models . we would study these types of model building systematically elsewhere .",
    "the orbifold background with @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge groups can also be studied . as the @xmath0 model",
    ", we can consider the orbifold models with the trivial twist @xmath119 .",
    "however , here we study the orbifold models with non - trivial twists and wilson lines , which break the gauge groups with reducing their ranks , in order to show the variety of model building on the backgrounds with magnetic fluxes , wilson lines and orbifolding .    as an illustrating model , we start with the 10d @xmath1 super yang - mills theory on the @xmath103 orbifold of section 2.2 .",
    "the @xmath1 adjoint representation @xmath192 is decomposed under @xmath237 as @xmath238 for example , we assume the following magnetic fluxes along this @xmath151 direction , @xmath239 then , three @xmath240 zero - modes as well as 24 @xmath241 zero - modes would appear without orbifolding .",
    "now , let us study non - trivial orbifold twists and wilson lines , e.g. in the @xmath242 part .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath240 matter fields , because only these matter fields have non - trivial representations under the @xmath242 group , that is , the doublet , @xmath243 before orbifolding , two components , @xmath244 and @xmath245 , in the @xmath242 doublet have the zero - mode wavefunctions , @xmath246 with @xmath247 . here , these forms of wavefunctions are the same , i.e. @xmath248 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 , but we put the indices @xmath251 to show that they correspond to @xmath244 and @xmath245 components , respectively . we embed the @xmath106 twist @xmath110 in the @xmath242 gauge space as @xmath252 for the @xmath242 doublet . in addition , we introduce a wilson line along the cartan direction of @xmath242 , i.e. @xmath253 e.g. on the first torus .",
    "since this wilson line is not commutable with the orbifold twist @xmath110 , the @xmath242 gauge group is completely broken . through this",
    "breaking , only three @xmath3 matter fields among three @xmath254 fields remain and their wavefunctions are obtained as @xmath255 up to a normalization factor , where @xmath256 denotes the continuous wilson line on the first torus . similarly , we can introduce wilson lines on other tori .",
    "the orbifold twist @xmath110 acts trivially on the @xmath257 fields , because they are singlets .",
    "then , six @xmath257 fields among 24 modes remain after orbifolding .",
    "this model can realize the three families of @xmath3 matter fields as well as several ( would - be higgsino ) fields @xmath258 .",
    "( of the superpotential ) in bulk , because all of remaining matter fields have the same 6d chirality @xmath259 and their couplings are not allowed in the 10d lagrangian . their couplings could be allowed on the orbifold fixed points , where the 10d lorentz symmetry is violated . ] furthermore , if we break @xmath4 to @xmath100 by wilson lines on the third torus , the wavefunction profiles of @xmath3 matter fields would split such that the profiles of quarks and leptons have peaks at different points .    in the above example",
    ", we have embedded the non - trivial combination between orbifold twists and wilson lines only into the @xmath242 part .",
    "one can embed them into other parts and break e.g. @xmath4 by the orbifold twist .",
    "of course we can start with the @xmath2 . at any rate ,",
    "non - trivial combinations of magnetic fluxes , wilson lines and orbifold twists could lead to various interesting models .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to study more on this type of model constructions .",
    "we have studied 10d super yang - mills theory with the gauge groups , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . on the torus and orbifold compactifications ,",
    "we have considered the magnetic flux background as well as wilson lines .",
    "this type of model building leads to interesting models .",
    "one of simple examples is the @xmath0 model on the torus and orbifold .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 models would lead to various interesting models .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to investigate more on @xmath1 and @xmath2 models . we would study them systematically elsewhere .",
    "also it would be interesting to study more on 4d effective theory , e.g. their flavor structure @xcite and predictions on quark / lepton masses and mixing angles after we would construct 4d models with realistic spectra .",
    "although we have started with 10d theory , we can start with other extra dimensions , e.g. 6d super yang - mills theory .",
