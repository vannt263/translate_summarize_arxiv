    "the basic values in statistical theory of spectra are moments of the intensity distribution @xmath0 . in the case of discrete spectra",
    "the @xmath1th statistical moment is defined as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the intensity of the @xmath4th line and @xmath5 is the corresponding energy difference . if the spectral lines are sufficiently close to each other then the spectrum may be approximated by a continuous function .",
    "then the @xmath1th moment of the intensity distribution is defined as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the range of the energy for which the integrand does not vanish .",

    "in particular , @xmath29 according to the so called _ principle of moments _ @xcite we expect that if we identify the lower moments of two distributions , we bring these distributions to approximate identity . in this paper",
    "we apply this principle to the theory of molecular similarity .",
    "we assume that molecules have similar properties if their intensity distributions and , consequently the corresponding moments , are approximately the same .",
    "we propose that statistical moments of the intensity distributions can be treated as a new kind of molecular descriptors .",
    "a very clear meaning has the first moment , @xmath30 , which describes the mean value of the distribution . in a similar sense",
    "a colour index has been introduced in astronomy @xcite - its value allows us to compare spectra of different stars ( it carries an information about molecules forming the star ) .",

    "similarity of distributions in two- and three - moment approximations , in the context of the construction of envelopes of electronic bands , has been analyzed in refs .",
    "analogously , we define similarity parameters @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the number of properties taken into account in the process of comparison ) as a normalized information derived from a comparison of two distributions , referred to as @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath38 here @xmath25 is the total number of properties taken into account in the comparison of the two spectra and @xmath39 , correspond to a specific property . in particular , as the property number one ( @xmath40 ) we take the first moment , as the property number two ( @xmath41 ) we take the second centered moment , number three ( @xmath42 ) - the asymmetry coefficient , number four ( @xmath43 ) - the kurtosis coefficient . in this paper",

    "we also define an additional parameter which may be evaluated if both spectra we are going to compare are available : @xmath50 this parameter is given by the integral of the module of the difference between the compared distributions and is not related to the moments . in the definition of @xmath51 , @xmath52 denotes the distributions transformed so that their averages are the same .",
    "if we compare two distributions of the same shape then @xmath53 .",
    "if two distributions do not overlap at all , then @xmath54 .",
    "it is important to note that the distribution moments are defined as numbers attached to a given spectrum and the similarity distances @xmath55 are easily derived from the knowledge of these numbers .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 , though it gives accurate information about similarity of two spectra , is rather cumbersome since it may be derived only if the complete spectra are given .    if two model molecules ( or rather their spectra ) are identical , up to the accuracy determined by the considered properties , then all @xmath34 are equal to @xmath49 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath34 is @xmath10 and corresponds to two spectra with no common features within the considered set of properties .",
    "the result of a comparison of two different objects depends not only on the number of properties taken into account but also on their choice ( @xmath56 or @xmath57 or @xmath58 @xmath59 ) . therefore the quantities @xmath60 defined in eq .",
