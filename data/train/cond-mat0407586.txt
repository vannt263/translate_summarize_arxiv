    "over the last few years considerable effort has been spared to synthesize the dielectric materials with controllable properties for many technical applications .",
    "the most promising substances are believed to be the compound materials consisting of solid solutions of different combinations of ferroelectrics with different dielectric properties .",
    "one of the examples is perovskite solid solutions like bimeo@xmath1-pbtio@xmath1 ( me = sc , in , etc . ) , which have high ferroelectric phase transition temperatures @xmath0 at the morphotropic phase boundaries with enhancement beyond the end members .",
    "such materials can be used as the materials with excellent high - temperature piezoelectric properties@xcite .",
    "a common feature of the above solid solutions is the existence of numerous random fields sources due to substitutional disorder , unavoidable impurities , vacancies in anion and cation sublattices etc .",
    "these random fields play a crucial role in the properties of disordered ferroelectric and magnetic materials ( see e.g. @xcite ) and above substances in particular .",
    "this means that observable physical properties of above systems depend strongly on the form of random fields distribution function .",
    "namely , the relation between width of the distribution function ( the dispersion of random fields ) and its first moment ( mean value of random field ) generates all observable features of the phase diagram of a disordered dielectric and/or magnetic materials , i.e. realization of ferroelectric ( ferromagnetic in the case of magnetic materials ) phase , dipole ( spin ) glass phase and mixed ferroglass phases .",
    "also , so - called paraglass ( griffiths ) phase may occur in disordered dielectrics ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    on the other hand , both ordered and disordered dielectrics have intrinsic nonlinearities , consisting in , e.g. , dielectric hysteresis .",
    "the `` interaction '' between these nonlinearities and random fields lead to their renormalization so that the distribution function of random fields will also include a nonlinear contribution of random fields .",
    "such calculation had been carried out in a different context in ref.@xcite .",
    "the calculations in ref.@xcite incorporate a self - consistent dependence of distribution function of random fields on the third order nonlinearity coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "it has been shown that when the nonlinear coefficient is sufficiently large and positive , the results are strongly different from those in linear case @xcite .",
    "in particular , for @xmath3 , the phase transition temperature exceeds its mean field asymptotic value , while for @xmath4 the results are qualitatively the same as in linear case . as we have found out earlier ,",
    "this phenomenon is due to the `` generation of order by disorder '' ( or more precisely , a specific positive feedback generated by positive nonlinearity ) taking place at @xmath3 .",
    "here we briefly review the main facts about the shape of distribution function of random fields with respect to nonlinear effects , a more detailed discussion can be found , e.g. in refs @xcite for disordered dielectrics and in refs @xcite for disordered magnetic semiconductors .",
    "the distribution function of random field @xmath5 can be represented in the form @xmath6 here the bar denotes averaging over spatial configurations of random fields sources ( e.g. electric dipoles , `` responsible '' for emergence of ferroelectricity in the above compounds ) , @xmath7 means the averaging over dipoles orientations , @xmath8 is the internal electric field induced by electric dipoles and other sources in the observation point @xmath9 . in a disordered ferroelectric",
    "this field already contains the intrinsic nonlinearity and can be written in the form ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath10 where @xmath11=x , y , z so that @xmath12 denotes simply the @xmath11-component of vector @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is an internal electric field induced by electric dipoles , @xmath15 is a coefficient of nonlinearity of @xmath16-th order .",
    "note that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ re2 ] ) can be generalized to account for other possible sources of random fields such as point charges , elastic dipoles etc @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the distribution function ( [ re1 ] ) with respect to ( [ re2 ] ) in the framework of statistical theory ( see @xcite for details of this theory ) for so - called disordered ising model ( when the dipole has only two admissible orientations ) yields the following rigorous result for any electric field component @xmath17 @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the distribution function , that takes into account only the first linear term in ( [ re2 ] ) ( distribution function of the first order )",
    ".    more detailed version of eq .",
    "( [ re3 ] ) reads @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the concentration and electric field of the dipoles .",
    "the eq.([re4 ] ) determines the function @xmath19 , calculated earlier in @xcite for the case of two - orientable electric dipoles .",
    "we note here , that in general case ( e.g. arbitrary interaction between above dipoles , their arbitrary concentration etc , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for discussion ) function @xmath19 has non - gaussian form .",
    "it can be shown that for our case of compound ferroelectrics it is sufficient to use its gaussian asymptotics , which reads @xmath23.\\ ] ] here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the order parameter ( number of coherently oriented impurity electric dipoles or dimensionless spontaneous polarization ) and the mean value of random field of electric dipoles ( in the energy units ) , @xmath26 is the effective electric dipole moment , @xmath11 and @xmath27 are , respectively , lorentz factor and static dielectric permittivity of the host lattice , @xmath21 is the concentration of electric dipoles .",
    "coefficient @xmath28 determines the width of the distribution function ( dispersion of random fields ) and depends on host lattice parameters like its correlation radius @xmath29 , see @xcite for details .      in our approach",
    ", an average value @xmath30 of any physical quantity can be represented in the form    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is determined by ( [ re3a ] ) and @xmath33 is the above quantity for single random field constituent , averaged over its internal degrees of freedom . in our case",
    "this is the average value over the orientations of single electric dipole .    to calculate the @xmath0 for disordered ferroelectric compound we need to calculate first the long - range order parameter @xmath34 . in the spirit of eq .",
    "( [ re7 ] ) we obtain following self - consistent equation for this parameter    @xmath35 de.\\ ] ]    here we use the fact that for two - orientable dipoles ( @xmath36 @xmath37 ) @xmath38 , @xmath39 .    the self - consistency of eq .",
    "( [ re7 ] ) is revealed by substitution of eq.([re7 ] ) into it , which yields    @xmath40 \\tanh \\left [ \\left(e + \\sum\\limits _ { m=2}^{\\infty}\\alpha _ me ^m\\right)/kt\\right ] de.\\ ] ]    in the linear case ( @xmath41 ) eq.([re9 ] ) transforms into that derived in @xcite .",
    "it is seen that order parameter is self - consistently expressed through itself and is the function of temperature , dipoles concentrations and nonlinearity coefficients .",
    "further simplifications of eq .",
    "( [ re9 ] ) are possible on symmetry grounds .",
    "namely , for the lattice with the center of inversion in paraelectric phase , the order parameter has to be an odd function of electric field , i.e. @xmath16 s in eq.([re9 ] ) are odd numbers . conserving only the first nonlinear term in @xmath42 argument",
    ", we obtain    @xmath43 \\tanh \\left [ \\left(e + \\alpha _",
    "3e ^3\\right)/kt\\right ] de.\\ ] ]    it is now instructive to consider the mean field limit of equation ( [ re10 ] ) .",
    "this limit corresponds to the case of an ordered ferroelectric , where the distribution function of random fields degenerates into a delta function @xmath44 .",
    "formally , in our method this limit corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "substitution of this @xmath46-function into ( [ re10 ] ) gives the desired mean field equation for order parameter    @xmath47\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is transition temperature in a mean field approximation ( see below ) , @xmath50 so that @xmath51 is dimensionless .",
    "we now use the eq .",
    "( [ re10 ] ) to derive the equation for ferroelectric phase transition temperature beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "the phase transition temperature is defined as a temperature when a nonzero order parameter @xmath34 appears . in other words , to get an equation for @xmath0 from ( [ re10 ] ) , we should put in it @xmath52 .",
    "this is accomplished by noting that at small @xmath34 @xmath53 \\approx e^{-\\frac{e^2}{4nb}}\\left(1+\\frac{ee_0l}{2nb}\\right).\\ ] ] subsequent substitution of ( [ re11 ] ) into ( [ re10 ] ) yields after some algebra @xmath54 here we introduced the following dimensionless variables @xmath55 equation ( [ tauc ] ) is the main theoretical result of this work .",
    "it predicts the existence of the critical concentration of dipoles @xmath56 such that for @xmath57 , the long range order in the system would never be realized .",
    "thus , the critical concentration is determined from the condition , that @xmath58 at @xmath59 . taking the limit @xmath60 @xcite in eq .",
    "( [ tauc ] ) , we obtain @xmath61 , which justifies the choice of dimensionless parameter @xmath62 .",
    "it is seen that the critical concentration does not depend on the coefficient of nonlinearity and it is completely the same as in linear case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "now we demonstrate that in a mean field approximation @xmath63 , i.e. that @xmath48 . for",
    "that we notice that this approximation corresponds to @xmath64 in ( [ tauc ] ) , which after some transformations @xcite gives @xmath63 .",
    "this value also does not depend on the coefficient of nonlinearity .",
    "the plot of dependence @xmath65 at different @xmath51 is shown on the fig.[fig : te ] .",
    "it is seen that at @xmath66 the dependence @xmath65 has maximum , while at @xmath67 it does not . moreover , for negative nonlinearity there is sharp lowering ( but not to zero ) of @xmath68 at certain @xmath69 .",
    "this demonstrates that a negative feedback almost destroys long - range order especially at small dipoles concentrations .",
    "this behavior shows that at @xmath70 nonlinear effects produce positive feedback thus enhancing the long - range order in the system , while @xmath67 the feedback is negative so that long - range order is inhibited but not completely destroyed even for large negative @xmath51 , see curve for @xmath71 on the fig.[fig : te ] .",
    "also , at sufficiently large positive @xmath51 we can achieve very large enhancement of @xmath0 as compared to its mean field value ( see curve for @xmath72 on the fig.[fig : te ] ) .",
    "since in our model we suppose that the value of @xmath49 is equivalent to @xmath0 for pure pbtio@xmath1 ( the end member of compound ) , we conclude that large positive @xmath51 give substantial increase of @xmath0 as compared to the end members of ferroelectric compound .",
    "in our model , the ferroelectric compounds are considered as an ensemble of electric dipoles embedded in some virtual paraelectric host , its nature we will discuss later . it can be supposed that in the considered system ( bisco@xmath1)@xmath73(pbtio@xmath1)@xmath74 electric dipoles are originated from pbtio@xmath1 , i.e. their number increase with @xmath75 increasing .",
    "the nondipolar random field sources like point charges , elastic dipoles etc .",
    "are also present in such compositions due to the mixed valency of bi and the difference in charges and ionic radii of bi@xmath76 and pb@xmath77 , ti@xmath78 and sc@xmath76 .",
    "these defects could easily be incorporated in the consideration ( see @xcite for details ) , but we do not consider their contribution here to have the minimal number of adjustable parameters when fitting the theory with experiment .    for quantitative description of experiment in above ferroelectric compounds in the framework of our random field theory ( in linear or nonlinear approximation ) we should have precise information about the concentrations of electric dipoles and other random fields sources as well as the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath29 etc .",
    "unfortunately the available data are strongly restricted for above compounds .",
    "that s why we recalculated our dimensionless parameters ( [ dim ] ) from the best fit to the experiment @xcite .",
    "namely , from the position and `` amplitude '' of maximum of experimental curve @xmath79 we determine our nonlinearity coefficient @xmath80 and coefficient of recalculation of parameter @xmath62 into @xmath75 .",
    "latter coefficient gives us value @xmath81c and critical content of pbtio@xmath1 @xmath82 .",
    "the result of such fitting is shown on the fig.[fig : ek ] .",
    "it is seen in figure 2 that there is pretty good coincidence between theory and experiment .",
    "this coincidence shows , that physical mechanism of enhancement of ferroelectric phase transition temperature beyond the end members in the ferroelectric compounds is the enhancement of initial ( i.e. that of end members ) long range ferroelectric order in them caused by positive feedback generated by the nonlinear effects with positive coefficient .",
    "the obtained value @xmath81c is very close to transition temperature of pbtio@xmath1 .",
    "this speaks in favour of statement that pbtio@xmath1 paraelectric phase can be considered as a host lattice .    as we have mentioned above , the origin of nonlinear effects in compound ferroelectrics is quite naturally related to its intrinsic nonlinearities , reflected , for instance , in their hysteresis loop .",
    "the physical origin of these nonlinearities may be the nonlinear coupling of the ions in the unit cell as well as the clusterization of dipoles in diluted ferroelectric compounds .",
    "each cluster has its own mesoscopic dipole moment ( polarization of cluster ) and such clusters can interact between each other . if interaction between such clusters is of positive sign , which may be manifested in the almost rectangular shape of hysteresis loop , we have the positive feedback with enhancement of initial ( i.e. that of end member ) long - range order with positive nonlinear coefficient .",
    "if the interaction is of negative sign , we have negative feedback and inhibition of ferroelectric order .",
    "but such negative feedback can not destroy ferroelectricity completely , probably except for the case of extremely small dipoles concentration .",
    "so , to achieve high positive values of nonlinear coefficients ( which are necessary to strongly enhance @xmath0 ) , we should have ( or prepare ) the end members of ferroelectric compound with `` as much as possible rectangular '' hysteresis loop .",
    "the contribution of nonlinearities to dielectric response and hysteresis loop in mixed perovskites pzt with impurities was discussed in ref .",
    ". the essential role of nonlinearity effect in explanation of phase diagram peculiarities in mixed ferroelectrics pbzr@xmath73ti@xmath74o@xmath1 , bazr@xmath74ti@xmath73o@xmath1 and mixed systems of ferroelectric relaxors was shown recently in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite respectively .    to make more precise prediction of which components in ferroelectric compound to use to increase @xmath0 beyond end members value , the measurements of correlation radius , lorentz factor and ions shifts in both end members and entire above ferroelectric compounds are highly desirable .",
    "it should be finally noted , that the theory outlined here permits one to calculate not only @xmath0 for above substances but virtually any equilibrium and/or nonequilibrium thermodynamic characteristics such as static and dynamic dielectric susceptibility , specific heat etc as a functions of pbtio@xmath1 content , temperature , electric field and other external parameters .",
    "we perform the asymptotic analysis at @xmath60 by changing the variable @xmath83 in the eq .",
    "( [ tauc ] ) and expanding in small parameter @xmath68 .",
    "the analysis for the case @xmath64 is performed by substitution @xmath84 and further expansion in small parameter @xmath69 ."
