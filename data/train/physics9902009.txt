    "many - electron ionization of atoms by laser field was firs observed by suran and zapesochny  @xcite in alkali - earth atoms ( the review of that work as well as some earlier ones see in  @xcite ) . at present ,",
    "such studies form one of main guidelines in physics of strong field interaction with atoms  @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical models were proposed for interpretation of the gathered experimental data .",
    "some models dealt with direct influence of laser radiation on the atomic electrons  @xcite , the others consider highly - stripped ion formation due to nonelastic scattering of previously emitted electrons with the parent ion  @xcite .",
    "these models allow to explain a number of observed features of the phenomenon  @xcite . nevertheless , there are some difficulties in theoretical description of highly - stripped ion formation in laser field which is not related to nonelastic collisions  @xcite . due to these difficulties ,",
    "the above mechanisms can not be properly used for explanation of the experiment .    at the same time",
    ", it is well - known fact that the single - charged ion formation by a laser field in tunnelling regime can be satisfactory described in terms of relatively simple formulae of the adk theory  @xcite .",
    "an empirical generalization of the adk formulae for describing the highly - stripped ion formation was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "so it would be reasonable to generalize the available theory of tunnelling in atoms to the case of non - sequentional multiple ionization of atom .",
    "solution of this problem is the objective of the present work .",
    "obviously , the josephson effect can be considered as a solid - state analogue of the considered phenomenon .",
    "some considerations on difference between the one- and many - particle tunnelling are mentioned in reference  @xcite .",
    "comparison of these considerations with the results of the present work shows that the mentioned difference for tunnelling in atoms is not so trivial as it was described in  @xcite .",
    "let us remembers some facts which make the main proposed concepts easer to understand . to describe optical transitions in complex atoms , bates and damgaard  @xcite modified the slater method  @xcite .",
    "basically , the nodeless character of slater orbitals was retained . unlike the slater method , the effective nuclear charge ceases to be a fitting parameter for valence electrons in atom since it coincide with the residual ion charge .",
    "but the effective principal quantum number is uniquely determined by the electron coupling energy .",
    "so the asymptotical region of electron motion is considered , where the atomic potential has coulomb shape .",
    "high accuracy of oscillator strengths calculations  @xcite using the bates  damgaard method and its clear physical justification allows to use this method in calculations of other atomic characteristics determined by large electron - nucleus distances .",
    "the tunnelling probability is also determined by large electron - nucleus distances where the energy of the electron interaction with the external field becomes comparable with the attractive energy of the residual ion .",
    "so the bates  damgaard method can be used for describing the tunnelling effect .",
    "such a procedure was developed in recent work  @xcite for tunnelling calculation in rydberg molecules . in that work",
    "some evaluations are presented for the applicability conditions of the method .",
    "let @xmath0 equivalent ( i.  e. belonging to the same atomic shell ) electrons are removed from the atom via tunnelling .",
    "then the asymptotic behaviour of the radial part of @xmath0-electron wavefunction in the bates ",
    "damgaard approximation is determined by the product of properly symmetrized one - electron function asymptotics : @xmath1 here @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the residual ion charge , @xmath4 is bohr radius , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the mass of electron and the absolute value of its charge , @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8  constant in  ( [ eq : psiasymptotics ] ) is determined in quasiclassical approximation not implying the condition  @xmath9 , which was required in  @xcite .",
    "it results in the arising of @xmath10 function with @xmath11 at @xmath12 .",
    "after passage to this limit the expression  ( [ eq : psiasymptotics ] ) for the @xmath8  constant turns into the formula  ( 11 ) of the reference  @xcite ( with an inaccuracy corrected : the number @xmath13 should be omitted ) .    the expression  ( [ eq : psiasymptotics ] ) for @xmath8",
    "is obtained under @xmath14 . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the quasiclassical approximation is not valid , so calculation of @xmath8 requires numerical approaches ( see , e.  g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the principal quantum number  @xmath16 is determined by the electron coupling energy . denoting the first , second etc .",
    "ionization potentials of the atom as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , the principal quantum number of @xmath19-th removed electron is @xmath20 if the electron are equivalent and are _ simultaneously _ removed from the atom , then for all the electrons @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coupling energy of @xmath0  electrons .",
    "note that in framework of the considered model , the asymptotic behaviour of the bound electron wave function  ( [ eq : psiasymptotics ] ) _ depends _ on the number of the removed electrons .",
    "so a partial account is provided for many - electron effects in the initial state .",
    "now we consider @xmath0-electron ionization as removal of a @xmath0-electron `` bundle ''  a peculiar kind of quasiparticle of mass  @xmath23 and of charge  @xmath24 . in the region which determines the ionization process",
    ", we consider the distances between the electrons in the bundle to be much less than the separation between the atomic core and the center of bundle mass . denoting the distance between the @xmath25-th and @xmath19-th electrons as @xmath26 , and the position of the center of bundle mass as @xmath27 ,",
    "we write the corresponding inequality : @xmath28 since the atom  laser radiation interaction is considered in dipole approximation , the influence of the field on @xmath0  individual electrons is completely equivalent to the influence of the field on a quasiparticle of charge  @xmath24 which is located at the point  @xmath27 . as for the interaction of this quasiparticle with the core coulomb field ,",
    "the correspondent error value is @xmath29 , which is small due to the accepted inequality  ( [ eq : x<<r ] ) .    for the mathematical description of the considered model , one should solve a problem which is analogous to that",
    "is occurred , e.  g. in nuclear @xmath30-decay theory .",
    "this problem is to construct the quasiparticle wave function  @xmath31 at large distances from the residual system , using the one - particle wave functions of the system in the initial state .",
    "symbols in the braces are sets of quantum numbers or coordinates of individual particles . to solve this problem we consider the asymptotics of the function  @xmath32 at @xmath33 , which is a product of the one - electron function asymptotics  ( [ eq : psiasymptotics ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the radial dependencies of the functions  ( [ eq : psiasymptotics ] ) bring the factor @xmath34 into the asymptotics of  @xmath32 . to obtain the angular dependence",
    ", the mean of the @xmath35 variables should be detalized .",
    "since the problem has the axial symmetry for the linearly polarized field , the orbital moment projections of non - interacting electrons onto the polarization direction are conserved .",
    "so it is convenient to leave the azimuth angles @xmath36 the same that in the original spheric coordinate system centered in the atomic nucleus .",
    "the change of variables will effect only on the absolute values  @xmath37 and polar angles  @xmath38 . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the behaviour of the legendre polynomials involved in the spheric functions  ( [ eq : psiasymptotics ] ) , is determined by @xmath40 substituting here @xmath41 , @xmath42 and introducing the parabolic coordinates @xmath43 , @xmath44 for the center of the bundle mass , the asymptotics of the @xmath0-electron function at @xmath45 can be written in the form @xmath46^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : b}\\\\ \\phi(\\xi,\\eta)\\sim\\exp\\left[-\\frac{n(\\xi+\\eta)}{2b}\\right ] \\left(\\frac{\\xi}{2b}\\right)^{n(\\nu-1 ) } \\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\xi}\\right)^{m/2 } , \\qquad m=\\sum_{j=1}^n|m_j| . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath47 is the normalized per unit wave function of the electron inner motion in the bundle .",
    "note that there are only @xmath48 independent variables  @xmath49 of @xmath50 .",
    "the function  @xmath51 describes the motion of the center of the bundle mass .",
    "the further calculation of the tunnelling probability is implemented according the standard technique  @xcite , an account provided for that the electron bundle mass is  @xmath23 and its charge is  @xmath24 . substituting the function  @xmath51 from ( [ eq : b ] ) into the schrdinger equation @xmath52 describing the motion with respect to the parabolic  @xmath53 coordinate at @xmath54 , we obtain the variables separation constant : @xmath55.\\ ] ] the centrifugal potential is neglected since it vanishes rapidly at @xmath54 .",
    "now we consider the external field  @xmath56 to be slow - varying , and use quasiclassical approximation for the wave function  @xmath57 which describes the center of the bundle mass motion in the field . in the below - threshold domain @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the greater root of the equation  @xmath60 .",
    "comparing the expression  ( [ eq : phi_f ] ) with the function @xmath51 from  ( [ eq : b ] ) at the point  @xmath61 lying in the region @xmath62 we obtain the @xmath63 value : @xmath64 the condition of existence of the region  ( [ eq : xi_interval ] ) leads to following restriction to the external field : @xmath65 which differs from the condition arising in the one - electron tunnelling description only by the definition of the @xmath16 value .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath16 essentially greater than 1 ( what holds , e.  g. for rydberg states ) the inequality  ( [ eq : f<<fa ] ) is changed by a stronger one : @xmath66 which is deduced from the condition of existence of the potential barrier  @xcite .",
    "the formulae  ( [ eq : phi_f ] ) and  ( [ eq : kappa ] ) determine the function  @xmath57 outside the barrier .",
    "with the account of inequality  ( [ eq : xi_interval ] ) , its squared absolute value is  @xcite @xmath67 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using  ( [ eq : nu ] ) and  ( [ eq : beta ] ) , it is easy to see that the dependence on the arbitrary parameter @xmath61 is actually disappeared in  ( [ eq:|phi_f|^2 ] ) : @xmath68 the ionization probability is determined by the flux of probability density  ( [ eq:|phi_f|^2_without_xi0 ] ) through a plane perpendicular to @xmath69-axis  @xcite : @xmath70 substituting here the formulae  ( [ eq : b ] ) and  ( [ eq:|phi_f|^2_without_xi0 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath71 this formula determines the @xmath0-electron tunnelling probability in dc field within a factor accounting for the overlapping of wave functions of the electrons remaining in the atom , with the wavefunctions of the same electrons in the initial state .",
    "obviously , this factor can not exceed 1 , and its more accurate evaluation can be performed only numerically . note that the @xmath0 multiplier in the exponent in  ( [ eq : wnul ] ) in now ways gives an exhaustive account for the dependence of this exponent on  @xmath0 , as it was considered in  @xcite .",
    "due to the formulae  ( [ eq : nu ] ) ,  ( [ eq : f<<fa ] ) , this dependence is significantly more complicated and it is determined by the spectrum of the particular atom .",
    "we present below ( figure  [ fig:1 ] ) a numerical example illustrating this statement .",
    "now we consider that @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the laser field frequency .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the tunnelling in a laser field is possible for small values of the keldysh parameter  @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the coupling energy of one electron . following the technique developed in  @xcite for `` particle '' of mass @xmath23 and charge @xmath24 , it is easy to see that the @xmath0-electron tunnelling is possible for small values of the parameter @xmath76 since the coupling energy is increasing for each subsequent electron , @xmath0-electron tunnelling requires field values lower than @xmath0-electron tunnelling cascade .    substituting  ( [ eq : f ] ) into  ( [ eq : wnul ] )",
    ", we average the result over the time interval @xmath77 $ ]  @xcite$ ] leads to @xmath78 and the tunnelling takes place in the direction of negative @xmath69 semiaxis . ] . due to the inequality  ( [ eq : f<<fa ] ) ,",
    "the integral arising here can be calculated using the saddle - point method . under the condition  ( [ eq : f < z^3e/16nu^4a^2 ] ) fulfilled , the saddle point is @xmath79 , and the final formula is : @xmath80 remember that the exponent dependence on @xmath0 in  ( [ eq : w(n ) ] ) is not reduced to the factor  @xmath0 which is written explicitly .",
    "unfortunately , the obtained formulae can not be immediately related to an experiment , because , along with the direct @xmath0-fold ions formation , there are a number of cascade processes as well as other ionization mechanisms due to nonelastic collisions of electrons and ions  @xcite . for the relation of the theory with an experiment , the correspondent kinetic equations are to be solved ,",
    "that should be a subject for another work .",
    "so only some illustrative examples are considered in this section .",
    "the figure  [ fig:1 ] presents the relation of probabilities of 3-fold ions formation in the noble gases resulted from two 2-cascade processes : @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "these probabilities are denoted as @xmath83 and @xmath84 correspondingly .",
    "they have similar dependence on the laser pulse duration . as it is seen , the relation @xmath85 is not equal to 1 , as it is follows from the results of reference  @xcite .",
    "the following result seems to be curious .",
    "the 2-electron tunnelling probabilities for neutral atoms can be greater than the one - electron tunnelling probabilities in correspondent singly charged ions .",
    "e.  g. , for ar atom the 2-electron tunnelling probability exceeds the 1-electron process probability for @xmath86 ion at the intensities  @xmath87 .",
    "the same result takes place for  kr at @xmath88 , for  xe at @xmath89 . at the same time , for light noble gases atoms  he and  ne , the probabilities of one - electron tunnelling in singly charged ions are approximately by two orders greater than the probabilities of two - electron process in the correspondent neutral atoms at  @xmath90 .",
    "these facts shows wide range of experimental situations arising in multiphoton tunnelling effect .",
