    "the precise nature of the physical mechanisms which result in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is one of the most fundamental open questions left in astrophysics at the start of this century .",
    "one of the main constraints that can be set on models of star formation is that the spectrum of masses ( mass function ) predicted is in good agreement with that observed in the local universe .",
    "the mass function @xmath0 at any given time is defined to be the number of stars @xmath1 per unit volume in a mass interval @xmath2 .",
    "the definition of the mass function is , therefore , @xmath3 note that the mass _ spectrum _ defined by  @xcite as @xmath4 is often referred to as the mass _ function _ but we shall stick with the original definition in @xcite . in this paper , we will only consider the imf below @xmath5  m@xmath6 as it is relatively poorly constrained in this region .",
    "the two most common functional forms for the imf are the power law form and the log  normal form .",
    "the power law form is @xmath7 where above masses @xmath8  m@xmath9 , @xmath10 ( e.g.  @xcite ) while at lower masses it is seen to flatten off . at the high mass end of our mass range",
    ", @xcite finds @xmath11 while @xcite and @xcite derive @xmath12 .",
    "kroupa also fits a power law in the range @xmath13 finding @xmath14 . finally , @xcite use a series of assumptions about the birthrate and a bayesian method to yeild a value of @xmath15 in the range @xmath16 . in order to explore this range in power ",
    "law exponents , here we examine imfs with values of @xmath17 of  0 , @xmath18  and  @xmath19 .",
    "the log  normal form of the imf is @xmath20 here we use a log  normal function with the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .    regarding observational studies of the imf , those in open clusters benefit from all the stars in the cluster being of the same age .",
    "hence , to derive the imf it is simply a matter of converting a measured luminosity function ( lf ) using a single mass  luminosity relation .",
    "however , objects in the field will have a range of ages , and since brown dwarfs ( objects below the the hydrogen burning limit of @xmath23 ) lack any internal energy source , they cool and decrease in brightness with time . in addition , the scale height of any stellar population within the galactic disk evolves with time .",
    "hence , both the photometric and kinematic properties of these objects are affected by their ages . in order to measure the mass function in the field we must therefore first consider the creation function and use models for the luminosity evolution of stars to convert it to an lf .",
    "this simulated lf can then be compared to the observed lf to see if the creation function assumed is viable .",
    "@xcite define the creation function @xmath24 as the number of objects created per unit time , per unit @xmath25 such that , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the age of the galaxy and @xmath28 is the stellar birthrate rate relative to the average birthrate such that @xmath29 , i.e.  the birthrate is the relative number of objects formed in the galactic disk per unit time ( note we assume that the imf is time ",
    "independent ) .",
    "the @xcite study of the birthrate suggested that it does not depend strongly on the density of gas in the galactic disk and is approximately constant . more recent studies such as @xcite have shown that stars appear to form in a series of bursts . in this study",
    "we model the stellar birthrate as constant or as an exponential , @xmath30 we employ four different values of the scale time @xmath31 : three decreasing birthrates with @xmath32 10 , 5 and 1 gyr and one increasing with @xmath33  gyr . when generating age distributions in simulations we use 10 gyr as the maximum age for an object in the galactic disk .    in order to study the birthrate and the imf below the hydrogen burning",
    "limit a large sample of ultra ",
    "cool dwarfs is required .",
    "ultracool dwarfs are the observed l and t dwarfs and the as yet unobserved y  dwarfs .",
    "infrared surveys are ideal for discovering large samples of cool dwarfs as they are brightest in the near infrared .",
    "the first major modern infrared surveys came with the deep near infrared survey ( denis ; @xcite ) and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "denis covers the southern sky in @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 down to limits of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 while 2mass is an all sky survey in @xmath35 , @xmath40 and @xmath36 down to limits of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "both have been useful for discovering ultra ",
    "cool dwarfs with denis finding several late m and l dwarfs and 2mass finding countless l dwarfs and a large sample of t dwarfs .",
    "in addition several tens of l and t dwarfs  @xcite have been found using the primarily optical sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) the next generation of infrared surveys will be undertaken with large format imagers such as wfcam  @xcite and wircam  @xcite .",
    "wfcam is a wide  field quasi schmidt camera mounted at the cassegrain focus of the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "a quadruple detector array provides ( with mosaiced observations ) a field of view of 0.77 sq .",
    "degrees . the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; @xcite ) is employing wfcam for a series of galactic and extragalactic surveys , and two of these surveys are ideal for the detection of ultra ",
    "cool dwarfs in the field . the large area survey ( las )",
    "is a wide  field , high latitude survey in @xmath44  @xcite and @xmath45 in the mko system ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; the ultra deep survey ( uds ) is a deep , narrow  field survey in @xmath45 . the initial two year program for the las will be 2000 square degrees to a depth of @xmath46 .",
    "the seven year plan will include a second @xmath35 band epoch to allow proper motion measurements and will cover 4000 square degrees to a depth of @xmath47 .",
    "the uds will cover 0.77 sq .",
    "degrees in both the two and seven year plans . in the two year plan only @xmath35 and @xmath48 will be observed to a depth of @xmath49 , while the full seven year plan also includes @xmath40 and will go one magnitude fainter in @xmath35 .",
    "the number of objects of different effective temperatures and colours ( which we shall employ as a detection function ) found in these surveys can provide information on the imf ( e.g.  @xcite ) and birthrate .    as well as having important statistical properties , ultra ",
    "cool dwarfs are also interesting objects in themselves . one particular area that ukidss hopes to study is the transition between the l and t spectral types . here",
    "the dramatic onset of methane absorption around @xmath50 and the removal of dust clouds high in the photosphere cause a sudden shift from red near infrared colours to blue near infrared colours .",
    "the exact details of this transition are still a matter for debate with many theories such as patchy cloud clearing @xcite , sudden downpours @xcite and runaway dust growth @xcite seeking to explain it . also of interest are the as yet unobserved y dwarfs .",
    "it is not yet known where there will be a significant shift in atmospheric chemistry causing the use of the label y. hence we define y dwarfs as cooler than the temperature for the coolest subclass of t dwarf given by  @xcite , 770k .",
    "there are many different sets of models ",
    "e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite  which predict a range of near infrared colours for these objects  @xcite .",
    "clearly y dwarfs discovered with ukidss can help to constrain these atmosphere models .    in the rest of this paper , we go on to describe our simulation method for predicting the number of ultra  cool dwarfs that will be found in the ukidss  las and  uds given the various assumptions described above concerning the form of the underlying birthrate and imf .",
    "we implement a simulated population method to predict the possible results of the ukidss las and uds .",
    "simulated ( very low mass ) stellar and substellar populations based on the different imfs and birthrates discussed previously are created .",
    "each simulated object is given an age based on the birthrate and a mass based on the imf , and these dictate the photometric and astrometric properties assigned .",
    "each object is subsequently passed through the survey selection mechanism to yield the simulated results of the survey .",
    "the local number of very low mass stars simulated is anchored using the same method as @xcite with the mass spectrum in the range @xmath51  m@xmath9 set to @xmath52  pc@xmath53 . using this method ,",
    "histograms binned by observables such as proper motions and colours can be produced .      in order to effectively model the positions and proper motions of our synthetic stellar population",
    "we must first consider their cartesian positions and space velocities .",
    "we generate heliocentric galactic cartesian coordinates out to a maximum distance of 2  kpc for the las and 10  kpc for the uds .",
    "our simulations indicate that l dwarfs are not detectable in either survey at distances greater than these . in our coordinate system @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "lie in the galactic plane while @xmath56 is perpendicular to the plane . these have velocities @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 associated with them .",
    "the @xmath54 and @xmath55 positions are randomly generated from a flat distribution while the @xmath56 position is generated from an exponential distribution with scale height @xmath60 .",
    "it is well established that the older populations have larger scale heights , hence we must incorporate this age dependency into our model .",
    "it is also clear that due to disk heating a population s velocity dispersion increases with age , and this is taken into account .",
    "hence , we generate space positions and velocities based on the age of the object . from these",
    "we calculate the sky positions , distance and proper motions .",
    "any object whose angular position falls within the survey area passes the positional survey selection mechanism .",
    "we utilise evolutionary models from  @xcite of ultra ",
    "cool dwarfs to provide look - up tables of quantities such as  @xmath61 and absolute magnitudes in a given passband , versus mass and age .",
    "the current picture of substellar models is one of division between two different model sets : those in which dust is suspended in the photosphere and those where the dust has largely settled below the photosphere .",
    "the spectrum of t dwarfs is best fitted by the models where the dust has settled , but the infrared colours of such models do not match well those observed for l dwarfs .",
    "we use temperatures and bolometric magnitudes from the dust settled ( cond ) models   across the m , l , t and y regimes in a manner similar to @xcite ( who noted that this would not produce a temperature error greater than @xmath62 ) . however , in order to properly model the photometric detectability for all these spectral types we must utilise an effective temperature versus bolometric correction relation of reach passband . @xcite calculated the colours of a series of ultra  cool objects from their spectra .",
    "we combined these with absolute j magnitudes ( converted into the mko system ) along with absolute magnitudes and effective temperatures   from @xcite and bolometric magnitudes from @xcite .",
    "we then fitted two separate polynomials in the t regime and in the m & l regime ( figure  [ bc ] ) since it is clear that in some passbands the relationship is discontinuous across the l  t boundary .",
    "we utilise the @xcite models in which the dust has settled below the photosphere to provide an effective temperature and a bolometric magnitude for each of the simulated stars .",
    "the temperature is then used to calculate the bolometric corrections ( and hence infrared magnitudes ) for each simulated object . for objects cooler",
    "than @xmath63 k we have no observational data on which to base bolometric corrections so we rely on the magnitudes predicted by the models . finally , the photometric survey selection method is simply detection above the quoted depths for the survey in all passbands used except k. this is because cool t dwarfs will be very faint in the k band due to methane and water absorbtion .",
    "( 75,150 )      the simulated @xmath61 distributions shown in figures  [ mfchange ] and  [ birthchange ] illustrate how altering the imf and birthrate respectively affects such histograms .",
    "mass functions which increase at lower masses will increase the number of low luminosity objects and hence will raise the height of the peak around @xmath64  k. a birthrate where most objects were created at early star formation epochs will deepen the trough around @xmath65  k as most objects will have evolved past the mid l spectral types into the t and y domain .",
    "these peaks and troughs are similar to those found by @xcite but , due to the varying ages of the objects , the complicated system of peaks and troughs found by @xcite for single  age populations is not seen .",
    "since the underlying form of the imf and birthrate affects markedly the number counts in @xmath61 and colour , those histograms should be a useful probe of the imf and birthrate .",

    "the las is designed to search for ultra  cool dwarfs , high redshift quasars and cool subdwarfs .",
    "it uses @xmath35 , @xmath40 and @xmath48 in addition to the @xmath44 filter  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath44 filter lies in between the @xmath34 and @xmath35 bands , is centred around one micron and is slightly redder than the @xmath66 filter .",
    "it is specifically designed for the study of ultra  cool dwarfs and quasars .",
    "it will provide a band to allow m , l , t and y dwarfs to be distinguished both from each other and from hotter main sequence stars .",
    "additionally sdss  @xcite photometry can be used to remove quasars from the sample  @xcite .",
    "the final survey will cover an area around the northern galactic pole as well as a small strip in the south galactic cap .",
    "both areas are scanned by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) allowing additional optical photometry to be utilised .",
    "the full seven year survey will go to depths of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( detection in @xmath48 was not required in the survey selection mechanism as many cooler objects have their luminosity severly reduced in this band due to methane and water absorption ) with an additional second scan in @xmath35 to allow proper motion measurements .",
    "simulations of the full seven year las area were carried out as described in section  [ sim ] .",
    "figure  [ pmhist ] shows the simulated proper motion histograms for objects of different spectral types .",
    "notice that later spectral types histograms peak at higher proper motions .",
    "this is simply a selection effect as cooler objects will only be observable nearby , where they will typically have large proper motions , @xmath35 and @xmath40 . ] .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     in order to study the constraints that could be set in more detail we first simulate a coarse grid in the ranges @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "once we identify the area of maximum probability in this coarse grid we simulate a second , finer grid centred around this region .",
    "this has ten times the resolution in @xmath17 and five times the resolution in @xmath73 .",
    "the results for such finer grids are shown in figure  [ zerozoom ] ( @xmath74 ) , figure  [ minus1zoom ] ( @xmath75 ) and figure  [ 0.1zoom ] ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the first thing that becomes apparent is that the noise on these finer grids means that there is not a smooth probability distribution .",
    "however it is obvious that there is a degeneracy between @xmath17 and @xmath73 . in order to glean information on the typical errors",
    "expected the probability distribution was marginalised over @xmath17 to produce a distribution in @xmath73 and vice - versa .",
    "the mean value of each parameter along with their standard deviations can then be calculated .",
    "these results are shown in table  [ res1 ] .",
    "it is clear that the calculated values are in agreement with the values of the parameters used to generate the @xmath77 histograms .",
    "( 75,100 )    ( 75,100 )    ( 75,100 )      to allow some real results in advance of ukidss data being available , we simulated the results of an existing ultra  cool dwarf survey , _ viz .",
    "_  the @xmath35 band luminosity function of @xcite , covering the l dwarf regime .",
    "we simulated a grid in the same manner as for the ukidss las with the appropriate cuts and limiting magnitudes quoted in cruz et al .",
    "we excluded the bin centred on @xmath78 as , although our maximum mass of @xmath79 equates to a stable main sequence absolute @xmath35 magnitude of 10.2  @xcite , the scatter into this bin from brighter bins caused by photometric errors would not be modelled correctly .",
    "we also excluded the two faintest bins from the probability analysis as they are described as being incomplete ( however we did simulate them to correctly model scatter ) .",
    "finally after going through the probability analysis we excluded a secondary peak which appeared at the edge of our grid as it was at a very high value of @xmath17 excluded by other studies .",
    "( 75,100 )    the resulting probability surface is shown in figure  [ cruzfig ] .",
    "the measured values of the parameters were ; @xmath80 ( implying a mass function rising at lower masses ) and @xmath81 .",
    "the question remains over what range of masses is this result valid .",
    "if we take @xmath79 as a maximum mass then our minimum mass will by given by the mass of an object with @xmath82 at an age of @xmath83  gyr , the maximum calculated in the @xcite models  we find this to be @xmath84 .",
    "hence the value of @xmath17 covers the range @xmath85 .",
    "this result ( albeit with a large error ) is consistent with both @xcite , who measured a value in the range @xmath86 of @xmath87 , and with the @xcite log  normal imf peaking at @xmath88 .",
    "it differs by just over @xmath89 from the @xcite value of @xmath90 .",

    "they can be used as a method for predicting the results of the ukidss surveys , yielding more accurate values for the expected number of extremely cool objects .",
    "this shows that  given current models and reasonable assumptions of the imf and birthrate ",
    "tens of y dwarfs should be detected .",
    "the second use will be using las data in conjunction with these simulations to constrain underlying distributions .",
    "our simulations show that for a sample size with a typical local density in the range @xmath91 the exponent of a power law imf can be constrained with an error of approximately @xmath92 while the birthrate parameter @xmath73 can be constrained to an error of @xmath93 .",
    "this method could prove very useful in determining both the imf and birthrate .",
    "however binarity has not been taken into account in these simulations .",
    "the level of unresolved binarity will provide another parameter to characterise the results of the las .",
    "furthermore , the simulations do not take contamination of the sample into account .",
    "photometric errors will scatter objects such as hotter stars and white dwarfs across colour  colour diagrams so that they have colours similar to ultra ",
    "cool dwarfs .",
    "this contamination will have to be quantified in order for accurate comparisons to be made with the simulations .",
    "the quasar locus crosses the ultra  cool dwarf locus on a @xmath94 versus @xmath95 plot ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and such objects may also cause contamination of the ultra  cool dwarf sample .",
    "however @xcite have produced a method to separate quasars from ultra ",
    "cool dwarfs using sdss  @xcite photometry , and this should minimize quasar contamination .",
    "clearly the techniques outlined here provide useful tools for both predicting the results of ukidss surveys and using those results to constrain the imf ( to an error in @xmath17 of 0.06 ) and birthrate ( to an error in @xmath73 of 0.015 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that using an existing small dataset ( 55 objects ) we can utilise this technique to produce loose constraints of @xmath17 and @xmath73 that are consistent with other studies : using the lf of @xcite , we have found values of @xmath80 in the range @xmath85 and @xmath81 .",
    "these techniques are also complimentary to those used by @xcite to examine the imf by empirical spectroscopic methods . while our techniques have the discussed limitations they will provide useful information to constrain the imf and birthrates .",
