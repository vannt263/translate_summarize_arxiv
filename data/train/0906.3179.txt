    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) can be formed in the early universe through the gravitational collapse of primeval cosmological density fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the formation probability of pbhs and their observational manifestations depend significantly on how the primeval density fluctuations emerged and developed .",
    "theoretical predictions of the pbh formation probability depend strongly on the adopted theory of gravitation and on the model of gravitational collapse .",
    "the evaporation of black holes @xcite , on which their experimental search is based , has not been completely studied either .",
    "thus , pbh detection will provide valuable information about the early universe and can be a unique test of the general theory of relativity , cosmology , and quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "direct searches for the bursts of gamma rays from the evaporations of pbhs have been carried out in several works during the last 15 years @xcite .",
    "the search for high energy gamma ray bursts on a shower array reduces to the search of space and time correlations ( clusters ) of registered extensive air showers ( eas ) .",
    "if time intervals used for the search are rather small , this search is performed in a horizontal reference frame .",
    "for each shower @xmath0 having absolute registration time @xmath1 and arrival angles @xmath2 the cluster of events @xmath3 is sought for , using a condition that arrival directions should differ less than @xmath4 from the weighted mean direction .",
    "thus , each cluster is characterized by multiplicity @xmath5 , duration @xmath6 , absolute time @xmath7 , and arrival direction @xmath8 .    during such a search ,",
    "experimentally obtained dependencies ( e.g. , cluster registration frequencies for each @xmath5 ) are compared to the ones expected from the background of accidental coincidences .",
    "if measured frequencies of cluster registration can be explained with distributions expected for accidental coincidences , one can obtain the constraints on a gamma ray burst frequency producing clusters with a given multiplicity ( and thus having particular energy flux ) .",
    "evaporating pbhs which have almost reached their final evaporation state are a possible source of high energy gamma ray bursts .",
    "since the calculated temporal and energy characteristics of such bursts depend on the theoretical evaporation model @xcite , the technique of an experimental search and the constraints imposed on the pbh number density in the local universe are model dependent .",
    "pbhs can be sought for in experiments on arrays designed to detect eass from cosmic rays with effective primary gamma - ray energies of 10 tev or higher only within the assumption that the evaporation model without a chromosphere @xcite is correct ( in such a model , evaporated particles do not interact with each other ) .",
    "the duration of the high - energy grbs predicted by chromospheric evaporation models is too short , much shorter than the dead time of eas arrays , and other methods have to be applied for the pbhs search in this case @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the duration of the high energy grbs is fairly short in the evaporation model without a chromosphere as well .",
    "therefore , the effect of the array dead time on the burst detection probability should be taken into account when interpreting the experimental data from eas arrays with a high threshold energy of the primary photons .",
    "such analysis have been performed in our previous work @xcite .    in the experiments searching for gamma ray bursts produced by pbhs",
    ", the constraints on the pbh number density are usually obtained from a condition of absence of clusters with a given multiplicity and duration .",
    "thus , an one - dimensional task is solved - each cluster ( not depending on multiplicity ) corresponds to the point with coordinate @xmath6 on a time axis , and cluster duration distribution is analyzed then .",
    "however , for the cluster with @xmath5 showers , the number of independent parameters ( time intervals ) is @xmath9 and such a cluster can be represented as a point in space with @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "one can expect that in those cases when time characteristics of pbh produced clusters are different from ones arising due to accidental coincidences , the increase the number of parameters can help to separate pbh events from background ones . in this case , due to background reduction",
    ", the constraint on the pbh number density obtained on a given array can be improved .",
    "this paper is devoted to exploring this idea and improving the constraint on pbh number density obtained previously on andyrchy array @xcite .",
    "the detailed description of this experimental facility can be found in @xcite .",
    "the detection probabilities @xmath10 of the eass generated by primary gamma - rays with energy @xmath11 falling on andyrchy array at zenith angle @xmath12 were determined by simulating of electromagnetic cascades in the atmosphere and the detector ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "total number of gamma rays which can be detected by the array ( integral burst profile ) is given by @xmath13 it depends on the time @xmath14 left until the end of pbh evaporation .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have defined the burst duration @xmath15 for the given array as time until the end of pbh evaporation during which 99% of photons which can be detected by this array are evaporated .",
    "this interval was used as the interval for search of clusters from pbhs , i.e. , @xmath16 ( and shower clusters with @xmath17 were sought for ) .    because the exact moment of pbh evaporation is unknown , the obtained experimental distributions for cluster lengths",
    "should be compared not with the burst profile , but with the calculated distribution of clusters with given multiplicity .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows , for @xmath18 , the calculated integral @xmath6 distributions for clusters with @xmath19 ( curves 2,3 and 4 ) . in the calculation , the dead time of the array had been taken into account . in the same fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the burst profile ( i.e. , the probability to detect a gamma particle from evaporating pbh in the interval of time between @xmath20 and full evaporation ) is also shown ( curve 1 ) .",
    "it is seen from this figure that 99%-level for clusters is achieved at durations much larger than @xmath15 .",
    "correspondingly , the time interval for search @xmath21 should be taken now as @xmath22 which we define as the time interval in which 99% of clusters with multiplicity @xmath5 fall .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the dependence of @xmath23 on zenith angle for different @xmath5 .",
    "one can note that time intervals @xmath23 shown in this figure are larger than @xmath15 ( e.g. , for @xmath24 , @xmath25 ms - see @xcite ) .",
    "because of this , maximum multiplicities for registered clusters also increase : for the case @xmath16 , maximum multiplicities were 4,4,3,2 for zenith angles @xmath26 ; for the case @xmath22 these values are 4,4,4,3 for the same corresponding values of zenith angles .    the probability to detect all showers hitting the array in a cluster with multiplicity @xmath5",
    "was calculated using monte - carlo method taking into account the dead time of the array ( only those clusters were taken for which time interval between consecutive events was larger than a dead time of the array @xmath27 ms ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "the result of the search for shower clusters from evaporating pbhs is the set of duration distributions of clusters for different @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows the experimentally measured distributions for a full observational time @xmath28 days , summarized over all zenith angles . for the search of clusters",
    ", we took @xmath29 - such a region contains 90% of events from a point source . in the same figure",
    ", we show modeled distributions for clusters produced by accidental coincidences of regular eass .    , zenith angle is @xmath18 .",
    "a ) events , expected from the evaporating pbh ; b ) events registered by the andyrchy array.,width=11 ]    it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] that , generally , experimentally registered cluster distributions can be explained as accidental coincidences of eass produced by cosmic rays .",
    "for clusters with @xmath5 showers , as we have seen , number of independent parameters ( time intervals ) is @xmath9 , and such a cluster can be represented as a point in space with corresponding number of dimensions . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows 3-dimensional distributions of clusters expected from pbhs ( fig . [",
    "fig11]-a ) and experimentally registered clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig11]-b ) for the case of @xmath30 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is seen that the measured clusters and the ones expected from pbhs occupy different regions in 3-dimensional space of time intervals .    in the subsequent analysis ,",
    "the probabilities for the modeled pbh event to get into a @xmath31-dimensional cell with size 1 ms in each dimension were calculated for each range of zenith angles @xmath12 and cluster multiplicities @xmath5 .",
    "these probabilities were summarized for each cell which contained experimentally registered events .",
    "if this sum did not exceed @xmath32 , we assumed , for pbh number density constraint calculation , that number of registered pbh events is zero ( for particular values of @xmath5 and range of zenith angles ) .",
    "we have obtained @xmath33 and @xmath34 for maximum cluster multiplicities of registered events , for @xmath26 , correspondingly .",
    "the constraints on the number density of evaporating pbhs in the local region of galaxy were obtained using technique described in work @xcite . let a pbh be located at distance @xmath35 from the array and be seen from it at zenith angle @xmath12 .",
    "the mean number of gamma - ray photons detected by the array over the burst duration is then @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the array area and @xmath38 is the fraction of the events from a point source that fell into an angular cell with a size of @xmath4 .",
    "the number of bursts detected over the total observation time t can be represented as @xmath39 with effective volume of the space surveyed by the array @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the detection probability of a cluster of @xmath5 or more eass with the mean value of @xmath42 . it can be expressed through the poisson probabilities for having @xmath0 showers ( and @xmath43 ) with average value of @xmath42 and probabilities @xmath44 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ] to detect all @xmath0 showers having a dead time for one event @xmath45 : @xmath46 for the calculation of the effective volume , we take @xmath47 ( this means that the distributions of the detected clusters in multiplicity can be explained by the background of accidental coincidences ; @xmath48 is the maximal multiplicity of the detected cluster obtained using multidimensional analysis ) .",
    "numerically , we obtain @xmath49 pc@xmath50 . if the evaporating pbhs are distributed uniformly in the local region of the galaxy , then the upper limit @xmath51 on the number density of evaporating pbhs at the 99% confidence level can be calculated from the formula @xmath52 as a final result , we obtain @xmath53 pc@xmath54yr@xmath55 .",
    "this is slightly better than the result obtained in our previous work @xcite with the same set of data but without using multidimensional analysis ( @xmath56 pc@xmath54yr@xmath55 ) .",
    "the detailed comparison of the results of different experiments searching for evaporating pbhs can be found in @xcite .",
    "this work slightly improves the pbh number density constraint of @xcite , but it is still significantly weaker than the best ( to date ) limit obtained in the experiment on the whipple cherenkov telescope @xcite ( @xmath57 pc@xmath54yr@xmath55 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the effective gamma - ray energy in our experiment is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the whipple telescope .",
    "thus , our upper limit pertains not to black holes in general , but to black holes with certain properties ( those emitting 100-tev gamma - rays at the end of their evaporation during bursts lasting @xmath58 ms ) .",
