    "the direct observations and evidences made by the high - z supernova search teams ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) in 1998 and 1999 indicated that the rate of the expansion of our universe is positive i.e we live in an accelerating expanding universe .",
    "the above fact has also been approved by astrophysical observations such as measurements of cosmic microwave background ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ; benoit et al . 2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) and the galaxy power spectrum ( tegmark et al . 2004 ; page et al . 2003 ) .",
    "these observations show that the geometry of the present day universe is almost flat .",
    "but the most surprising and unbelievable result comes from these observations is the fact that only @xmath4 of the universe total energy density is in the baryonic ( non - relativistic ) matter , @xmath5 non - baryonic ( relativistic ) matter called dark matter ( dm ) , and almost @xmath6 is an completely unknown component with negative pressure called dark energy ( de ) . despite the matter , dark energy produces a repulsive force which give raises to the current cosmic accelerating expansion . since 1998",
    ", many theoretical and observational attempts have been done in order to investigate the real nature of the dark energy .",
    "the most important problem in the study of de is the fact that this mysterious component does not interact with baryonic matter and hence we do not have any way to detect it . although some of current observations ( bertolami et al .",
    "2007 ; le delliou et al . 2007 ) show that there is an interaction between de and dm , bout the amount of this interaction is very small and it is not detectable by our today technology . up to date , we only know that dark energy is non - clustering and spatially homogeneous ; while it dominates the the present universe , it was small at the early times .",
    "+ from theoretical point of view , the study of the nature of dark energy is possible through it s equation of state parameter @xmath1 which is the ratio of the pressure and the energy density of de .",
    "however , the exact value of the dark energy eos parameter at the present time is not clear for us yet .",
    "the lack of our knowledge , allow us to suggest different theoretical candidates for dark energy .",
    "the first and natural candidate is a cosmological constant @xmath7 with @xmath8 ( weinberg 1989 ; carroll 2001 ) .",
    "but this model can not explain why the present amount of the dark energy is so small compared with the fundamental scale ( fine - tuning problem ) and why it is comparable with the critical density today ( coincidence problem ) . to solve such fundamental problems associate with the cosmological constant scenario the different forms of dynamically changing de with an effective equation of state eos including quintessence ( @xmath9 ) ( wetterich .",

    "2004 ) , and etc have been proposed . +",
    "a simple and straightforward way to solve the coincidence problem in cosmology is to consider an energy flow from de to dm ( cimento et al .",
    "2003 ; dalal et al .",
    "such an energy transfer could easily explain why , at the present time , the energy densities of dark energy and dark matter are almost equal . theoretically , interacting and non - interacting dark energy models have been widely studied in the literatures ( zhang 2005 ; zimdahl & pavon 2004 ; setare 2007a , b ; setare et al .",

    "+ in this paper , we study the interaction between dark energy and dark matter on the bases of anisotropic bianchi type i space - time . up to our knowledge , this work is the first study of interacting dark energy in an anisotropic space - time in it s general form .",
