    "a long - lived isolated stochastic population ultimately goes extinct via a large fluctuation : an unusual chain of deleterious events resulting from the demographic noise ( the intrinsic discreteness of individuals and random nature of birth - death processes ) and environmental variations , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "it is important to understand how the interplay of environmental and demographic noises determines the mean time to extinction ( mte ) @xcite .",
    "early models postulated that the environmental noise , which modulates the birth and death rates of the population , is delta - correlated in time @xcite . later on",
    ", population biologists realized , mostly via stochastic simulations , that temporal autocorrelation , or color , of environmental noise may have a considerable effect on population extinction @xcite .",
    "these insights inspired physicists who developed a theoretical framework for the analysis of a joint action of demographic and colored environmental noise on extinction of an established population whose dynamics follows a simple stochastic logistic model @xcite .",
    "this theoretical framework provided a transparent way of evaluating the mte and finding the optimal environmental fluctuation that determines the optimal ( most likely ) path of the population to extinction .",
    "the theory of @xcite predicted the mte in different regions of a two - dimensional  phase diagram \" whose axes are the properly rescaled intensity ( or , alternatively , variance ) , and the correlation time of the environmental noise .",
    "it tracked how the population - size dependence of the mte changes from exponential with no environmental noise to a power law for a short - correlated noise and to no dependence for long - correlated noise .",
    "it also established the validity domains of the white - noise limit and adiabatic limit .",
    "( in the adiabatic limit the environmental noise is assumed to vary very slowly compared with the relaxation rate of the population toward the attracting fixed point of the deterministic rate equation . )",
    "the simple logistic models adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite do not account for the demographic allee effect , by which population biologists mean a host of effects leading to an effective reduction in the per - capita growth rate at small population size @xcite .",
    "when the allee effect is significant , a non - zero critical population size for establishment arises .",
    "if the initial population size is smaller than the critical size , the population quickly goes extinct .",
    "if the initial population size is greater than the critical one , an established population appears .",
    "population biologists have argued that the allee effect may influence , in a significant way , the population extinction risk due to the demographic and environmental noise @xcite .",
    "no satisfactory theoretical framework , however , has been developed .",
    "the present work attempts to close this gap .",
    "we formulate a minimal theoretical framework for this problem by considering a simple set of stochastic reactions which mimics the allee effect in a well - mixed population .",
    "the per - capita rates are modulated by a positively correlated gaussian noise with given magnitude and correlation time .",
    "we assume that the allee effect is so strong , that the established population size , as predicted by the deterministic rate equation , is close to the critical population size for establishment . in this limit ( that is , close to the saddle - node bifurcation of the deterministic rate equation )",
    "a fokker - planck equation can be derived , which accurately describes the time evolution of the joint probability distribution of the population sizes and environmental fluctuations . throughout this work",
    "we assume that both the environmental noise and the demographic noise are weak , so the mte of the population is very long compared with the characteristic relaxation time predicted by the ( noiseless ) deterministic rate equation for this population .",
    "this enables us to use a small - noise approximation due to freidlin and wentzell @xcite : essentially , a dissipative variant of wkb approximation .",
    "the wkb approximation reduces the fokker - planck equation to an effective two - dimensional classical mechanics .",
    "the optimal path of the population to extinction and the optimal environmental fluctuation are encoded in an instanton - like trajectory in the hamiltonian phase space of this classical mechanics , while the mte is related to the mechanical action along the instanton .",
    "we solve the effective mechanical problem , and obtain analytic estimates for the mte , perturbatively in three different limits : of short - correlated , long - correlated , and relatively weak environmental noise , for a population exhibiting a strong allee effect .",
    "we also find , in each of these limits , the optimal ( most likely ) path of the population to extinction and the optimal environmental fluctuation .",
    "we complement our analytic results by solving numerically the equations of motion of the effective classical mechanics .",
    "we find that the allee effect has a strong impact on the mte .",
    "it was discovered more than 30 years ago by leigh @xcite that , without the allee effect , a strong uncorrelated ( white ) environmental noise changes the population - size dependence of the mte from an exponential to a power - law with a large exponent .",
    "we show here that , in the presence of the strong allee effect , no power law appears . here",
    "the population - size dependence of the mte changes from exponential for weak environmental noise to no dependence for strong environmental noise .",
    "our theory is readily extendable to population _ switches _ between different metastable states , and to noise - induced population explosion , due to a combined action of demographic and environmental noise .",
    "where possible , we compare our results with previous ones .",
    "we reiterate that both demographic and environmental noises are weak in our theory .",
    "therefore , when we call the environmental noise weak or strong , we only mean that it is weak or strong compared with the demographic noise .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "sections ii and iii include preliminaries . in section ii",
    "we introduce a simple model of long - lived stochastic population which exhibits the allee effect and ultimately goes extinct because of demographic noise .",
    "we start with the deterministic limit of the model and then outline its stochastic behavior , focusing on the limit of a strong allee effect . as a preliminary , we present in section ii a calculation of the mte based on wkb approximation . in section iii we add environmental noise to the model : first white noise , and then colored noise . in section iv we evaluate the mte of the population under the simultaneous action of environmental and demographic noises .",
    "different subsections of section iv deal with different limits : of short - correlated , long - correlated and ( relatively ) weak environmental noise .",
    "section iv also includes a brief discussion of ( relatively ) strong environmental noise where our results for the mte coincide with previously known results .",
    "our main findings are summarized in section v.",
    "in the absence of environmental noise , a stochastic population exhibiting the allee effect can be mimicked by three elementary reactions describing binary reproduction , its inverse process and linear decay @xcite : @xmath1 with the ( constant ) reaction rates @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the _ deterministic _ ( or mean - field ) theory only deals with the mean population size ( the number of @xmath5 s in the system ) , which is assumed to be large : @xmath6 .",

    "these fluctuations are caused by the demographic noise coming from the discreteness of  particles \" and from the stochastic character of the reactions ( [ reactions ] ) .",
    "as @xmath13 , these fluctuations are typically small .",
    "however , a rare large fluctuation ( an unusual chain of deleterious reactions ) ultimately arises and drives the population to extinction .",
    "indeed , with the death of the last particle , there is no mechanism which would replenish the population . because of the allee effect , it is sufficient for the fluctuation to bring the population below the critical point @xmath20 , whereupon the population goes extinct essentially deterministically @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the population size are encoded in the probability @xmath22 to have , at time @xmath23 , a population of @xmath14 particles .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath22 is governed by the master equation @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the effective birth and death rates . after a short _ relaxation time _ , determined by eq .",
    "( [ a_mf ] ) , a long - lived metastable distribution is formed where @xmath22 becomes sharply peaked at @xmath21 with an exponential decay towards @xmath20 and an almost flat tail at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this almost flat tail determines the very slow  probability leakage \" into the absorbing state at @xmath27 .",

    "@xcite for detail .    employing the large parameter @xmath34",
    ", one can accurately calculate the mte and qsd in this and many other one - population models @xcite .",
    "our present strategy , however , is different .",
    "we will make an additional assumption of a very strong allee effect where the critical population size @xmath16 is relatively close to the established population size @xmath17 as described by the deterministic system ( [ a_mf ] ) .",
    "equivalently , the system ( [ a_mf ] ) is close to its saddle - node bifurcation corresponding to the appearance of the fixed points @xmath35 . in this limit",

    "furthermore , in this limit @xmath22 varies with @xmath14 sufficiently slowly , and the van kampen system size expansion @xcite becomes an accurate and controllable procedure .",

    "<S> we study the combined impact of a colored environmental noise and demographic noise on the extinction risk of a long - lived and well - mixed isolated stochastic population which exhibits the allee effect . </S>",
    "<S> the environmental noise modulates the population birth and death rates . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the allee effect is strong , and the environmental noise is positively correlated and gaussian , we derive a fokker - planck equation for the joint probability distribution of the population sizes and environmental fluctuations . in wkb approximation </S>",
    "<S> this equation reduces to an effective two - dimensional hamiltonian mechanics , where the most likely path to extinction and the most likely environmental fluctuation are encoded in an instanton - like trajectory in the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the mean time to extinction @xmath0 is related to the mechanical action along this trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain new analytic results for short - correlated , long - correlated and relatively weak environmental noise . </S>",
    "<S> the population - size dependence of @xmath0 changes from exponential for weak environmental noise to no dependence for strong noise , implying a greatly increased extinction risk . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is readily extendable to population switches between different metastable states , and to stochastic population explosion , due to a combined action of demographic and environmental noise . </S>"
