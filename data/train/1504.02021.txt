    "<S> this implies that in these regions the dissociation effect is very strong and saturated . </S>",

    "<S> ( c , e , g ) , in the regions where @xmath40 is extremely large , the ratio @xmath38 gradually increases with @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in these regions the dissociation effect becomes weak again . according to our theoretical analysis , </S>",
    "<S> this is because that the feshbach molecule state is resonant with free - motion states with high momentum when @xmath40 is very large . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element of the hamiltonian between these two states ( frank - condon factor ) becomes small , and thus the transition rate from the molecule state to the polarized states is decreased .    </S>",
