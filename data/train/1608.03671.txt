    "bok globules , introduced by @xcite are the regions of relatively small isolated and dense , rounded globules . these globules are believed to be the areas of potential star formation and hence , are the most suitable candidates for studying the direct interplay between protostellar collapse , fragmentation and magnetic fields @xcite . the magnetic field in the outer region of a molecular cloud is often mapped in the optical wavelength , whereas the inner area is mapped in infrared and sub - millimeter wavelength , by measuring the linear polarization of the background stars @xcite .",
    "the polarization of the radiation observed through a dusty medium is partly plane polarized , from the aligned dust grains in the interstellar medium .",
    "these dust grains are generally lined up with their long axes perpendicular to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied three globules cb 56 , cb 60 and cb 69 to map the magnetic field within the observed region of the cloud .",
    "they estimated the extinction of field stars from @xmath6 magnitudes and identified the probable location of each field star ( background / foreground / within the cloud ) .",
    "the polarization efficiency of these clouds was also studied which showed a decrease in polarization efficiency with an increase in extinction along the observed line of sight .",
    "@xcite presented the polarimetric observations in the optical and near - infrared of the three bok globules b 335 , cb 68 and cb 54 , which were combined with archival observations in the sub - millimeter and the optical .",
    "they traced the magnetic field structures of these globules over a range of @xmath7 au , covering optically thin and optically thick regions .",
    "recently , @xcite studied near - ir polarimetry data of background stars shining through a selection of starless cores taken in the @xmath8 band , probing visual extinctions up to a@xmath9 48 ( mag ) .",
    "they found that polarization efficiency decreases with increase in a@xmath10 with a power law slope roughly @xmath11 .",
    "however , at greater optical depths they found no grain alignment .",
    "if one accepts the theory of dust grain alignment via radiative torques , this lack of alignment at greater optical depths may be due to the absence of a radiation source @xcite .    as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", there are two conventional methods viz .",
    "the star count and the near infrared color excess ( nice ) method , used for measuring extinction of background stars in the observed line of sight . in the star count method , extinction values are measured , at the expense of angular resolution which in turn losses the details of structural information @xcite . however ,",
    "multi - wavelength near infrared ( nir ) color excess method can measure extinction value at much deeper optical depth with significantly improved angular resolution with smaller uncertainties @xcite .",
    "various nir extinction mapping techniques ( nice , nicer , nicest ) have been used in the recent years to study the detailed structure of the clouds ( viz .",
    "the distribution of the dust , temperature , density and the stability of the core ) @xcite .",
    "we have taken polarimetric observations of cb130 at the r - band , with an aim to measure the optical polarization of background field stars to map the magnetic fields within the globule .",
    "the values of visual extinction ( @xmath12 ) for background field stars are estimated using e(j - k ) method @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have made a combined study of optical polarization and extinction of background field stars of cb130 .",
    "we have also created a visual extinction map of cb130 , using the stellar color excess method as described by @xcite , which is a generalized version of nice mapping technique developed by @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present a brief description of cb130 .",
    "observation details and data reduction techniques are discussed in section 3 .",
    "finally , a detail discussion of results obtained are given in section 4 , and a set of conclusions based on our work is presented in section 5 .",
    "cb130 ( l507 ) is an elongated globule , situated in the aquila rift region ( galactic coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) @xcite . @xcite first cataloged cb130 , along with 248 other small isolated molecular cloud . @xcite",
    "have categorized cb130 as `` a '' type cloud , by comparing co peak line , temperature and co line width of 248 small molecular clouds .",
    "`` a '' type cloud comprises a maximum number of clouds i.e. 74@xmath15 of 248 clouds , where gas temperatures are cold ( @xmath1 8.5 k ) and have tiny turbulent gas motion .",
    "cb130 is found to be located at a distance of 250@xmath250 parsec ( pc ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected three cores in cb 130 from south to north and named them as cb 130 - 1 , cb 130 - 2 and cb 130 - 3 whose central coordinates are shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "it is to be noted here that cb 130 - 1 represents the central core of the globule cb 130 . @xcite",
    "detected two ysos in cb 130 - 1 using a three - color ( 3.6 @xmath16 as blue , 4.5 @xmath16 as green , and 8.0 @xmath16 as red ) image of cb130 - 1 using @xmath17 irac images and go-2 program ( cores2deeper ) .",
    "@xcite later named these two ysos as cb130 - 1-irs1 and cb130 - 1-irs2 , which are 15@xmath18 apart , corresponds to 4100 au , further , they mapped cb130 - 1 region with co ( j = 2@xmath191 ) at caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) and found no significant evidence of out - flowing gas .",
    "@xcite also detected that cb130 core contains two well resolved compact sources ( named them as smm1 and smm2 ) , and observed that smm1 is brighter than smm2 .",
    "further , smm1 is associated with a faint nir source , a very red star @xmath1 3000 au east of smm1 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite detected previously known embedded heating sources like protostars , including the vello ( very low - luminosity object ) in cb 130 , based on the temperature and the herschel maps .",
    "they did nt detect any new source other than the previously known warm , compact source in the globule .",
    "polarimetric observation of bok globule cb130 was carried out at r - band with exposure time of 600 sec in six nights , namely 26th , 28th and 30th april , 2014 and 2nd , 3rd and 4th may , 2014 , from the 2-m cassegrainian focus telescope ( focal ratio of f/10 ) of girawali observatory at inter university center for astronomy and astrophysics ( iucaa ) , pune ( igo , latitude : 19@xmath205@xmath21n , longitude : + 73@xmath2040@xmath21 e , altitude = 1000 m ) , india .",
    "the iucca faint object spectrograph and camera ( ifosc ) is the main instrument attached with the telescope , which is equipped with an eev 2k @xmath22 2k pixel@xmath23 ccd camera and an imaging polarimeter of fov @xmath1 2 arcmin radius , to measure linear polarization in the wavelength band @xmath24 nm .",
    "this instrument also uses a half - wave plate ( hwp ) followed by wollaston prism to observe two orthogonal polarization components that define a stokes parameter . for further details",
    "please refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "the average value of fwhm for the stellar images is @xmath1 2 arcsec .",
    "the observations were made for four sub - regions to cover cb 130 - 1 core .",
    "description of the steps followed for data reduction , and calibration of results are same as discussed in @xcite .",
    "instrumental polarization is determined by observing an unpolarized standard star hd 115617 , and its polarization value in r - band , is found to be @xmath25 0.05@xmath15 which is in good agreement with literature @xcite .",
    "we have also observed a polarized standard star hd 154445 at r - band taken from @xcite ( our results : @xmath26 = ( 3.48 @xmath2 0.06)% , @xmath27 = 88.90 @xmath2 0.87 degrees ) to calibrate our result with zero - position angle . in table",
    "[ tab2 ] , we have presented the estimated values of linear polarization at r - band for 54 field stars of cb 130 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     .",
    "[ tab3 ]    we have estimated the value of mean particle density @xmath28 by using the relation    @xmath29    assuming it to be a cylindrical filament . here ,",
    "@xmath30 ( in cm ) is the diameter of the cloud and @xmath31 = 1.74 is the mean extinction based on our study on section 4.2.1 and this value matches well with our extinction map .",
    "it is worthy to mention here that we have considered all the stars are lying behind the cloud .",
    "based on spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , column density and dust temperature maps , @xcite estimated the mean radii of cb130 to be @xmath32 . also we have used standard gas - to - extinction ratio @xmath33 @xcite to estimate the mean molecular hydrogen column density .",
    "this ratio assumes that most of the hydrogen is in molecular form where @xmath34= 3.1 .",
    "further we assumed that cb130 is located at a distance of 250 pc ( refer to section 2 ) .",
    "further uncertainty in our estimations of the magnetic field strength , arises from the errors in measuring , density of the core , turbulence velocity and standard deviation of position angles .",
    "however unavailability of uncertainties in both density of the core and turbulence velocity , have restricted us to determine the uncertainty in the magnetic field from the error associated with the standard deviation of polarization angles .",
    "we used , the standard error ( s.e ) @xcite , here n represents sample size , for our case n=39 ] as a measure of precision in measuring standard deviation of polarization angle , which is found out to be 3.20@xmath0 . using above data ,",
    "we have estimated the mean magnetic field in the peripheral region of cb130 to be @xmath35 which is listed in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "the non - spherical dust grains of the interstellar medium , are believed to be aligned with respect to the magnetic field by the interactions of the incident anisotropic radiation with the grains and the local magnetic field , which in turn produces differential extinction and hence polarize the background starlight .",
    "@xcite found that the bending and distortions of magnetic field lines traced by optical polarization can be expected in regions where the accumulation of gas has occurred , or still occurring , with infall speeds comparable to or greater than the alfven waves .",
    "the dependence of polarization ( hence the grain alignment ) , on the visual extinction , is generally estimated by measuring _ polarization efficiency _ , defined as the ratio of polarization produced for a given amount of extinction ( @xmath36 ) @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5](a ) , represents the variation of @xmath12 versus @xmath37 for the field stars of cb130 .",
    "it should be noted here that we have considered all the stars to be located in the background to the cloud .",
    "however tracing the magnetic field by estimating the linear polarization of background starlight in optical wavelength is limited to low extinction region only ( @xmath38 1@xmath395 ( mag ) ) @xcite .",
    "it can also be observed that the field stars of cb130 , lie below the line drawn by using the relation : @xmath40 ( mag ) representing the optimal polarization efficiency of the grains due to selective extinction in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite found @xmath36 = 3 ( per cent mag@xmath41 ) for those regions where the magnetic field is disordered or not transverse to the line - of - sight , or the degree of grain alignment is lower .",
    "they also concluded that the interstellar dust grains must be sufficiently non - spherical and sufficiently aligned so that @xmath36 = 6 ( per cent mag@xmath41 ) .",
    "however the theoretical upper limit of the @xmath36 @xmath42 14 ( per cent mag@xmath41 ) , for dust grains consisting of completely aligned infinite dielectric cylinders @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5](b ) displays the variation of @xmath43 vs. @xmath12 for the field stars of cb130 , it indicates that polarization efficiency decreases with the increase in extinction , which suggests that there is a decline in the efficiency of grain alignment in the inner region as compared to the outer region of the dark cloud .",
    "this observed variation in @xmath36 may arise due to various factors , such as the presence of turbulence in the magnetic field in the medium and/or various components of random / uniform magnetic fields oriented differently along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "@xcite also studied this phenomenon of a decrease in polarization with an increase in extinction for the taurus dark cloud ( tdc ) by considering some factors ( poor grain alignment , grain growth and/or changes in grain shape or composition ) .",
    "recently @xcite showed that the radiative torques model can predict a fall - off of polarization efficiency with increasing extinction .",
    "this dependency of polarization efficiency on extinction can be well explained by using a power law of the form @xmath44 .",
    "the solid line in the figure shows an unweighted power - law fit to our sample @xmath36 = @xmath45 ( percent mag@xmath41 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the findings of @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , a similar dependence of polarization efficiency on extinction in the bok globules cb56 , cb60 and cb69",
    "was reported .",
    "1 .   we have traced the local magnetic field structure of cb 130 in low - density region , by measuring the value of linear polarization in the optical wavelength for 30 field stars ( whose @xmath46 ) .",
    "polarization map obtained from our study indicates that the polarization vectors of most of the stars are aligned in some common direction which in turn shows that magnetic field orientation sampled by these background stars appear to be aligned on average .",
    "the angular offset between the position angle of the galactic plane of the cloud and the mean value of observed polarization position angle is 53@xmath47 , which indicates the polarization produced within the cloud has a direction different from that generated in the is medium .",
    "further , we have found that the minor axis is almost perpendicular to the mean peripheral magnetic field of cb130 .",
    "we have estimated the value of @xmath28 = @xmath48 for cb130 , which is further used to calculate the mean magnetic field strength in the outer envelope which is given by @xmath49 .",
    "we have also presented the visual extinction map , on which polarization vectors of 39 field stars are overlaid , which represents the spatial variation of polarization with extinction in the observed plane of the sky of cb 130 .",
    "we have found that the variation of polarization with extinction is feeble in the low - density region of the cloud .",
    "the extinction map is constructed using nice method from nir data , of dimension @xmath50 .",
    "we have detected three distinct cores in cb130 and named them as @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 from south to north .",
    "cores @xmath51 and @xmath53 are found to be located very close to the central coordinates of cb 130 - 1 and cb 130 - 2 .",
    "further , we have observed that @xmath53 is identical with cb130 - 1-irs2 detected by @xcite .",
    "we could nt associate @xmath52 to any previously known sources in the literature , as we did nt find enough studies done around that region .",
    "contours of herschel spire 500@xmath54 map , are overlaid on the extinction map at the center of the cloud cb130 .",
    "it is observed that the contours are roughly elongated along north - east to southwest direction , and the magnetic field geometry of the cloud in the periphery seems to follow this large - scale structure , as most of the polarization vectors overlaid are well aligned with the elongation of these contours .",
    "5 .   visual extinction ( @xmath12 ) for 15 field stars of cb 130 has been estimated employing @xmath55 method .",
    "we further found that the background starlight of cb 130 shows a tendency to decrease in polarization efficiency ( @xmath43 ) with the increase in extinction .",
    "this suggests that there is a decline in the efficiency of grain alignment in the inner region as compared to the outer region of the dark cloud .",
    "our results are in agreement with the findings of other clouds by different investigators .",
