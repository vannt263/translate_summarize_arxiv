    "the appearance of quantum phase transitions at zero temperature and its consequences toward finite temperature have attracted considerable attention in the last years .",
    "the heavy - fermion compound ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 is regarded as a model system to study the influence of quantum criticality on the physical properties at low temperatures .",
    "it exhibits an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase transition at an extremely low temperature of @xmath1 = 70  mk . upon applying a tiny magnetic field of @xmath2 = 60  mt within the tetragonal basal plane the afm ordering",
    "is suppressed and the system is driven toward a field - induced quantum critical point ( qcp ) @xcite . recently , an additional energy scale @xmath9 was found to vanish at the critical point in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite , at which hall effect measurements indicate a fermi surface volume reconstruction according to the local moment scenario @xcite .",
    "the thermoelectric power is a sensitive tool to study low - energy excitations and can shed light on the evolution of the fermi surface topology . for a degenerate fermi gas within the boltzmann picture and the relaxation time approximation the diffusion thermopower",
    "is given by the mott formula @xmath10 .",
    "the logarithmic derivative @xmath11 can be transformed into a transport term that contains the energy dependence of the scattering time and a term of purely thermodynamic character including the inverse of the effective mass tensor @xcite .",
    "thus , thermopower reflects both the influence of the energy dependence of the density of states ( dos ) and the quasiparticle scattering rate at the fermi level . in the landau - fermi - liquid ( lfl ) state , when @xmath11 is temperature - independent , @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath12 . in heavy - fermion metals due to the reduced characteristic energy scale @xmath13 the renormalized electron masses and",
    "the ratio s / t are strongly enhanced . as a consequence , a close relation between the thermopower @xmath5 and the specific heat @xmath14 in the zero temperature limit",
    "is discussed @xcite .    here , we report on low - temperature thermopower @xmath3 measurements of a high - quality ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 single crystal down to 30  mk , tuning the ground state of the system from an antiferromagnetically ordered state to a non - magnetic fermi - liquid state by the application of varying magnetic fields .",
    "ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 single - crystalline platelets of high purity were grown from in flux with a molten - metal - solvent technique in closed ta crucibles as described earlier @xcite . for the presented thermoelectric transport investigations a large , bar - shaped sample ( 4 @xmath15 0.5 @xmath15 0.1 mmm@xmath16 ) with an optimized geometry factor of @xmath17 = 60  mm@xmath18",
    "was chosen , whereas @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the effective length and the cross section of the sample .",
    "the sample exhibited a residual resistivity @xmath21 = 2  @xmath22 cm corresponding to a residual resistivity ratio @xmath23 40 .",
    "the thermopower measurements in the temperature range 0.03  k @xmath24 6  k were carried out in a commercial dilution refrigerator .",
    "the measurements were performed in steady - state conditions by utilizing a one - heater - two - thermometer - technique .",
    "the thermal gradient along the specimen @xmath25 was determined by two ruo@xmath26 chip resistors acting as hot and cold thermometer , while the heater in use was a meander - shaped resistor .",
    "the thermovoltage @xmath27 was measured with an analogue picovoltmeter by using superconducting nbti wires connected to the sample . during experiment temperature gradients @xmath28",
    "0.01 were applied , with @xmath29 being the mean temperature .",
    "the temperature stability of the two sample thermometers was usually better than 0.1% . to achieve a good thermal contact the sample",
    "was tightly clamped to the cold finger and thermometry was connected to the sample by means of 50  @xmath30 m au wires .",
    "all thermometry equipment was suspended by thin nylon wires in a frame of vespel , electrical connections made with nbti wires .",
    "the heat flow was always applied perpendicular to the @xmath31 axis of the tetragonal structure of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "no respect was paid to the distinction between ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) direction within the @xmath32 plane .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field was always parallel to the heat flow and therefore transverse effects in field are disregarded .",
    "the reliability of the low-@xmath12 set - up was verified by measuring a pb test sample below its superconducting transition temperature @xmath33 = 7.19  k. as the thermopower is zero in the superconducting state the results of this measurement are taken to determine the thermovoltage background signal @xmath34 .",
    "it was found to scatter around zero with a magnitude of the order of 25  nv / k in the whole temperature range , only at lowest temperatures ( @xmath35 200  mk ) it increased to 50 nv / k .",
    "for the analysis of the presented low - temperature data only the electron diffusion contribution @xmath36 to the thermopower has to be considered as it is described by the mott formula ( see above ) .",
    "a phonon - drag contribution @xmath37 to the thermopower usually yields a maximum in @xmath3 at 0.1 - 0.2 @xmath38 @xcite , with @xmath38 being the debye temperature of the system .",
    "as @xmath38 was estimated to be of the order of 380  k @xcite , a possible phonon - drag contribution would not appear within the investigated temperature range and is therefore completely disregarded .",
    "furthermore , crystal electric field ( cef ) effects do not play any role in the low-@xmath12 range , as the excited levels of the yb@xmath39 ion are well separated from the ground state @xcite .",
    "high - temperature thermopower studies on pure and lu - doped ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 reveal the influence of the kondo temperature @xmath40 at @xmath41 10 - 20  k and the overall cef splitting to appear at @xmath41 80  k @xcite , respectively .",
    "figure [ ybrh2si2-s ] shows the low - temperature part of the thermoelectric power @xmath3 of an ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 single crystal for various magnetic fields applied .",
    "@xmath3 exhibits a smoothly decreasing curvature with comparably large negative values over the whole investigated temperature and field range .",
    "high values and a negative sign are typically observed in yb kondo - lattice systems with the sharp kondo resonance lying below the fermi level .    in zero field and at sufficiently low temperature",
    "the system is situated on the afm side of the qcp , but very close to the magnetic instability . from thermopower measurements",
    "the phase transition at @xmath1 = 70  mk is neither evidenced by any kind of anomaly , nor a distinct change of temperature behavior is resolved when entering the afm phase .",
    "this is in contrast to observations from @xmath42 and @xmath7 measurements , where @xmath1 shows up as a sharp anomaly and a pronounced drop in zero field @xcite , respectively .",
    "however , a sign change of @xmath3 from negative to positive appears in thermopower at @xmath43 30  mk for @xmath44 = 0 .",
    "this situation is very exceptional , as to our knowledge _ positive _ thermopower values at such low temperatures have never been observed in any yb system before .",
    "the zero - field measurements do not resolve a linear - in - t behavior , neither above nor below @xmath45 .",
    "thus , in contrast to @xmath42 and @xmath7 the thermopower results do not indicate a recovery of a lfl ground state within the magnetic phase .    upon applying magnetic fields the ground - state properties of the system changes as it is driven toward the non - magnetic side of the qcp and lfl regime",
    "is recovered .",
    "this is evidenced by a @xmath46 behavior in resistivity and a constant sommerfeld coefficient @xmath47 @xcite . in the thermopower",
    "the low - temperature behavior strikingly changes compared to the zero - field curve . below a certain temperature @xmath6",
    "the thermopower extrapolates linearly to zero for @xmath48 , clearly evidencing the lfl regime from thermopower measurement .",
    "the temperature @xmath6 below which lfl behavior is recovered is well distinguished and fully coincides with the findings from resistivity investigations on the same sample . with increasing field the range of lfl regime",
    "is extended to higher @xmath12 , while absolute values are reduced and the slope of the curves changes . for temperatures",
    "well above 1  k all @xmath3 curves finally merge and exhibit an almost identical @xmath12 dependence ( not shown ) . the low-@xmath12 thermopower behavior within lfl phase",
    "is fitted according to @xmath49 , with @xmath50 being the initial slope of the curves .",
    "this yields large values of @xmath50 = 13.5  @xmath30v / k@xmath51 and 7.2  @xmath30v / k@xmath51 for @xmath44 = 0.1 and 1  t , respectively .",
    "enhanced values of @xmath52 have been reported for a few heavy - fermion systems ( see for example @xcite ) and are considered to be in close relation to the strongly enhanced specific heat in these systems .",
    "when approaching the critical field @xmath2 of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 the @xmath20-coefficient of the @xmath46 term to @xmath7 , the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath47 and the initial slope of @xmath5 are strongly increasing .",
    "figure [ ybrh2si2-phasediagram ] shows the low - temperature @xmath53 - phase diagram of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "the shaded region represents the non - magnetic lfl phase , where @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath12 together with a @xmath46 behavior in @xmath54 and @xmath47 being a constant .",
    "the crossover line @xmath6 as derived from resistivity measurements coincides perfectly with the recovery of lfl behavior as evidenced by the thermopower investigations .",
