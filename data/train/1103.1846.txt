    "standard proto - planetary disc models @xcite show that the inner @xmath6 au region is too hot to allow existence of small solid particles there .",
    "thus planets should not be able to grow there . yet",
    "observations of nearby solar type stars show that many of them do host planets in that inhospitable to planet formation region .",
    "the very first exoplanet to be convincingly detected had the separation of @xmath7 au to its parent star and had a mass of about that of jupiter @xcite .",
    "such gas giant planets circling their parent stars in a close proximity ( @xmath8 au ) are now called `` hot jupiters '' .",
    "it is believed that they are explained by the inward radial drift ( migration ) of the planets born further out @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission has recently produced a number of surprising results @xcite , one of which is that there is an even greater number of smaller planets , e.g. , earth - size to neptune - size , in that region .",
    "it is similarly obvious that these smaller `` hot '' planets also had to be brought there from further out by an inward radial migration .",
    "one practical difficulty in testing this idea , though , is that the migration of smaller planets is expected to occur in the poorly understood `` type i '' regime @xcite .",
    "this is different from the better understood `` type ii '' regime by which the giant planets migrate @xcite .",
    "this theoretical difficulty leads to a large range in uncertainties in the predictions of the detailed core accretion model calculations ( e.g. , see fig . 5 in * ? ? ?",
    "recently , the key importance of the radial migration of the earliest gas condensations formed in the massive proto - planetary discs by the gravitational instability was realised @xcite .",
    "analytical estimates @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite show that these condensations can migrate all the way from their birth - place in the outer @xmath9 au disc into the inner @xmath10  few au disc and be disrupted there during the earliest massive disc phase ( @xmath11 few@xmath12 yrs , typically ) .",
    "it was pointed out by @xcite and @xcite that this migration - and - disruption sequence yields an unexplored way of forming terrestrial like planets .",
    "if dust grows and sediments in the centre of the clump and forms a solid density core there , then tidal disruption of the gas clump may leave a solid core ",
    "an earth - like proto - planets ( note the connection to earlier ideas of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used a simple spherically symmetric radiation hydrodynamic code with the dust grains as a second fluid to delineate the conditions when such a mechanism for the solid core growth can work .",
    "based on the potential promise of these ideas , @xcite formulated the `` tidal downsizing '' ( td hereafter ; * ? ? ? * ) hypothesis for planet formation . in this picture a partial disruption of a @xmath13 gas clump ( which we also call giant embryos ; ges ) leaves a giant planet , whereas a complete disruption yields a terrestrial like planet .    in this letter",
    "we continue to assess the potential utility of the td hypothesis to planet formation .",
    "we note that another ingredient , muted but not explicitly considered by @xcite , must be included in the scheme . to explain it , consider isolated ges first . as they contract , their internal temperature increases .",
    "at early times the rate of this contraction is controlled by the radiative cooling rate of the embryo  which is by the rate at which the embryo can get rid of the excess energy . however , when temperature @xmath14 k is reached , molecular hydrogen disassociates .",
    "this process is an efficient energy sink , which allows the embryo to contract rapidly  in fact collapse hydrodynamically  without the need to radiate the energy away .",
    "the embryo collapse stops only at much higher densities , and temperatures as high as @xmath15 k , at which point hydrogen is ionised .",
    "the embryo must then continue a slower contraction , again regulated by the rate at which its energy is radiated away .",
    "the collapse is known as the `` second collapse '' in the star formation literature @xcite , when the `` first cores '' of masses @xmath16 collapse @xcite to become `` second cores '' , which are the proper proto - stars .    in the td hypothesis for planet formation",
    ", the second collapse may be the last step to making a gas giant planet .",
    "however , as we show below , this final step is not automatically successful  planets continuing to migrate rapidly towards their parent stars may still be disrupted at @xmath17 au .",
    "we suggest this process as a way of forming the hot super earths observed by the _",
    "_ mission @xcite .",
    "in analogy to the star formation literature , we refer to the ges that are mainly molecular , embryo s temperature @xmath18 , as the `` first ges '' ; those where h@xmath19 is disassociated are termed `` second ges '' instead .      to illustrate the main point of this paper , we calculate the contraction of a giant embryo with `` typical '' parameter values ( e.g. , those that appear quite reasonable to us for a solar metalicity disc around a @xmath10 solar mass star ; see * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the embryo mass is @xmath20 , the normalised dust opacity is @xmath21 , and the grain mass fraction @xmath22 .",
    "the embryo is initialised as a first core of same mass ( see * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the time evolution of the embryo s central temperature ( solid , in units of @xmath23  k ) , the gas density ( dotted , in units of @xmath24 g @xmath25 ) , and the outer radius of the embryo , @xmath26 , ( dashed , in units of 1 au ) .",
    "the calculation is carried out with an updated version of the 1d gas - dust grains radiative hydrodynamics code of @xcite . instead of using an ideal gas equation of state with @xmath27",
    ", the code now uses the equation of state appropriate for molecular hydrogen , including disassociation and rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom for h@xmath19 , with the orto - hydrogen to para - hydrogen ratio fixed at 3:1 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    despite the updated equation of state ,",
    "the evolution of the first embryo is quite similar to that of the cases studied in @xcite .",
    "this may not be entirely surprising given the similar insensitivity of the first ( gas ) cores to the equation of state as found by @xcite .",
    "the embryo contracts and heats up , whereas dust grains grow . by time",
    "@xmath28 yrs , the grains increase in size to about 20 cm .",
    "their density exceeds that of the gas in the centre of the embryo ; they become self - gravitating and form a solid core of mass @xmath29 . in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , the solid core formation is notable by the bump in the central temperature . after the core formation , the central region becomes hotter than grain vaporisation temperature of @xmath30  k , evaporating the grains , and thus terminating further core growth ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details on this negative feedback loop ) .",
    "the central region also expands slightly .",
    "most of the ge is however unaffected by the solid core in this case , and the curves resume their otherwise monotonic behaviour a few hundred years later .    at @xmath31 yrs",
    ", the ge goes through the second collapse when the central temperature exceeds about 2300 k. the embryo radius drops rapidly , while the density and the temperature increase strongly .",
    "the first embryo becomes the second in our terminology .",
    "our radiation hydrodynamics code is not well suited @xcite to follow the long cooling and contraction of the second embryo .",
    "however , there is a body of work on the hydrostatic contraction of very low - mass stars and jupiter - mass planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which allows us to describe the process with a good degree of confidence .",
    "let @xmath32 be the time of the second collapse of the embryo .",
    "as is well known , the embryo spends the initial contraction stages on the hayashi track . during this phase ,",
    "the outward energy transfer is dominated by convection . the effective temperature , @xmath33 is almost constant at @xmath34 [ see figs 1 in @xcite ] .",
    "the luminosity of the embryo is then @xmath35 .    with this simple cooling model",
    ", we solve for the evolution of the second ge radius , @xmath36 , @xmath37 where the energy of the ge is defined with the positive sign as @xmath38 .",
    "a trivial integration yields proto - stars as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "] , @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the ge radius at the time of the second collapse , @xmath32 , and @xmath41 .",
    "this model does not take into account the electron degeneracy pressure in the ge , but that becomes important only after @xmath42 yrs , and would make disruption of the planets even more likely .",
    "evaluation of equation ( [ re_t ] ) shows that at times @xmath43 yrs , the initial radius of the embryo is quickly forgotten , and the contraction proceeds as @xmath44 the second embryo s density as a function of time is @xmath45 in terms of absolute values , the initial density of the second embryo is at least @xmath46 g @xmath25 ( cf .",
    "fig . 1 ) and rises with time according to @xmath47 where we set @xmath48 for certainty .",
    "a distance @xmath49 away from the star , the tidal density is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the stellar mass , and @xmath521 au .",
    "a giant embryo that migrated to a distance @xmath49 is disrupted if the embryo s density @xmath53 .",
    "the first and the second embryos have considerably different internal densities . the `` first embryos '' are characteristically disrupted at @xmath54 au @xcite .",
    "we term these disruptions `` cold '' and do not consider any further here .    to evaluate the second ge s fate",
    ", we need to estimate its migration rate .",
    "we assume that there is only one such ge in the inner @xmath55 few au at any one time . due to its significant mass",
    ", the ge migrates in the type ii regime .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the migration time , @xmath56 , is shorter than but is comparable to the `` accretion time '' , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the accretion rate in the disc . in the td model ,",
    "the planets are born in the very early gas - rich phase of the disc when the proto - star is far from its final mass .",
    "the accretion rate during that phase is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 yrs is the free - fall time for typical interstellar molecular gas cores of @xmath61 mass @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath62 now , this time scale is to be compared with the kelvin - helmholtz time scale for isolated giant planets , which is of the order of @xmath63 yrs ( e.g. , see figs . 2 & 3 of * ?",
    "in fact , any additional effects we can think off , e.g. , stellar irradiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , tidal heating , energy stored in the rotation of the ges , accretion of planetesimals , etc .",
    ", should only increase @xmath64 .",
    "we can now estimate the embryo - star separation at which the disruption occurs , @xmath65 , e.g. , where @xmath66 . for this",
    "we note that @xmath67 in equation ( [ rho_ass ] ) should be of the order of @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , this is the time it takes the embryo to migrate inwards , and thus the embryo s age should be comparable to that . entering @xmath56 instead of @xmath67 in equation ( [ rho_ass ] ) , we find that the dependence on the embryo s mass cancels out , and we arrive at @xmath69^{1/3 } = 0.12 \\;\\hbox{au } \\left({\\dot m \\over 10^{-5 } \\msun",
    "\\hbox{yr}^{-1 } } \\right)^{1/3}\\ ; , \\label{rhot_t}\\ ] ] where we set @xmath48 and retained the dependence on @xmath58 only .",
    "we term this inner disruption `` hot '' to distinguish from the more distant cold disruptions .",
    "equation [ rhot_t ] shows that a second ge entering the inner @xmath70 au in an early disc phase , when @xmath58 is very high , is likely to be tidally disrupted . on the other hand",
    ", `` late arrivals '' , when @xmath4 yr@xmath3 , may survive and contract into hot jupiters as the disc runs out of mass , presumably due to photo - evaporation @xcite .",
    "we now present two approximate example calculations that are complete in the sense that they start off with the embryo s birth at @xmath71 au and they end with the embryo arriving in the innermost disc .",
    "we use the model embryo calculated in  2.1 and 2.2 , and an approximate radial migration model of @xcite .",
    "we consider two opposite limiting cases to illustrate the points made in [ sec : young ] .      in the first case , presented in figure [ fig : fig2 ] ,",
    "the accretion disc is massive and the accretion rate is high . in particular , the initial mass of the star is @xmath72 , the doubling timescale for the star , @xmath73 yrs .",
    "this yields an accretion rate through the disc of @xmath74  yr@xmath3 . at @xmath75 , the assembly of the star",
    "is assumed complete ( its mass reaches 1 @xmath76 ) , and the disc torques are abruptly removed .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that the mass of the ge is constant until it is disrupted dynamically .",
    "3d simulations of embryos migrating in gas discs show destruction of the embryos in a matter of two or three orbits @xcite once they fill their roche lobes .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the radial location of the embryo .",
    "the embryo migrates into the inner @xmath70 au region of the disc in less than @xmath77 yrs due to the high disc accretion rate .",
    "the middle panel shows the evolution of the hills radius , @xmath78 , and the embryo s radius , @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath26 is initially one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the hills radius , especially right after the second collapse .",
    "the lower panel shows the embryo s temperature evolution , which is comprised of two parts : the first one calculated as in  2.1 ( and shown in figure 1 ) until the second collapse occurs , at which point we switch to the model of  2.2 , with @xmath79 found through the virial relation of the embryo .",
    "the `` hot '' disruption of the embryo occurs at time @xmath80 yrs , at the embryo - star separation of @xmath81 au .",
    "note that disruption of the gaseous envelope leaves a solid core behind since the solid core formation occured much earlier .",
    "the solid core migrates slightly to @xmath82 au by @xmath75 .",
    "this last bit of radial migration is via type i and may in reality be far less efficient @xcite .      in the other example we take a proto - star that is closer to its final mass , @xmath83 , accreting at a rate of @xmath84  yr@xmath3 for @xmath85 yrs .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows that in this case the embryo migrates much slower . by the time it arrives in the innermost disc , the embryo radius , @xmath26 , dropped to about @xmath86 au .",
    "the embryo is too compact to be disrupted unless it migrates even further to @xmath87 au ( it is likely to stall before that due to the magnetospheric cavity in the inner disc ) .",
    "we suggested here that massive gaseous proto - planets in the `` second '' configuration , migrating rapidly inward , are tidally disrupted in the inner @xmath70 au .",
    "if these protoplanets contain solid cores , then the cores remain unaffected by the disruption as their densities are much higher . for solid cores more massive than @xmath88",
    ", parts of the gaseous envelopes may be retained as well @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hot disruption of gas giant planets could in principle result in the production of purely solid and also solid plus gas envelope planets similar to those found in the _ kepler _ data .",
    "further modelling of the regions closest to the solid cores inside the embryos is needed for a more quantitative statement .",
    "the outcome of a hot jupiter arriving in the inner @xmath89 au strongly depends on the migration rate of the latter and its age .",
    "if the proto - planet is `` old '' , e.g. , @xmath90 myrs , then it is too dense to be disrupted near the star .",
    "the observed hot jupiters in our interpretation are the planets that arrived in the inner @xmath89 au somewhat late , when they were already compact , and when the disc was running out of material .",
    "some of the _ kepler _ neptune and earth - size planets could have parted with their gaseous envelopes in the cold disruptions at a few au , and then migrated inward in the disc .",
    "this would make for a second channel of making these planets in the inner disc .",
    "however , the location of hot disruption is quite well defined , @xmath91 , due to the strong dependence of the tidal density on @xmath49 .",
    "therefore we predict a pile - up of smaller planets at those radii _ as long as _",
    "the actual type i migration rate of the disruption remnants is far smaller than the theoretical type i migration rate ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "such a pile - up may be testable with the current exoplanet data .",
