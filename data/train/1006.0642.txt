    "psr  j1738 + 0333 is a 5.85ms pulsar in a low eccentricity binary system with orbital period of @xmath1 @xcite and a low mass helium white dwarf ( wd ) companion .",
    "the pulsar was discovered in 2001 in a 20-cm intermediate galactic latitude survey @xcite carried out with the multi - beam system of the parkes telescope .",
    "given its low northern declination , it can be observed with much improved sensitivity using the the 305-m arecibo telescope . for that reason",
    "it has been timed with arecibo since 2003 using the l - wide receiver ( with frequency coverage from 1100 to 1700 mhz ) .",
    "we used the wide - band arecibo pulsar processor ( wapp ) correlators and the arecibo signal processor ( a coherent dedispersion machine ) as back - ends .",
    "the wapps have bandwidths of 100 mhz centered at 1170 , 1410 and 1510 mhz ( and , occasionally , a fourth wapp centered at 1310 mhz as well ) .",
    "the wapp correlator data were fourier transformed to obtain one 256-point power spectrum every 64 @xmath2s .",
    "these are then folded and dedispersed at the pulsar s spin period and dm using `` sigfoldpow '' , a program designed by ingrid stairs specifically for producing highly accurate average pulse profiles from search data .",
    "the asp data have not yet been fully analyzed , that is one of the reasons why these results are still preliminary .",
    "the observed pulse profiles are then cross - correlated with a low - noise template , the best fit yields a pulse time of arrival at the telescope ( toa ) .",
    "the toas were then analysed using the tempo timing software , which makes a least - squared fit of the observed barycentric toas to a timing model , which includes spin , astrometric and orbital parameters .",
    "we have obtained a toa residual rms of 1.4 @xmath2s , with toas taken every 268 s for each of the 12 ( or 16 ) simultaneous 12.5-mhz sub - bands .",
    "this results in more than 16000 toas . of these",
    ", we use 9000 with a stated accuracy better than 3 @xmath2s .",
    "this large number of precise toas provide extraordinarily precise timing parameters . these include the proper motion ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and parallax ( @xmath5 ) , which corresponds to a distance of @xmath6kpc .",
    "the orbital period is measured so precisely ( @xmath7 s ) that we can already detect the orbital decay , albeit to only 2-@xmath8 precision : @xmath9 .",
    "this becomes more significant after subtracting the extrinsic orbital period variation caused by the proper motion of the system @xcite and the galactic acceleration : @xmath10 .",
    "the intrinsic orbital period derivative is @xmath11 .",
    "the companion white dwarf has been detected , and it has deep spectral lines typical of a @xmath12 thick - envelope he white dwarf .",
    "these were used to determine a radial - velocity curve using gemini south on cerro pachn . from this",
    "we can derive the mass ratio of the system , @xmath13 ( van kerkwijk , 2007 , pers .",
    "comm . ) . at the moment",
    "we do nt have a good estimate of the companion mass .",
    "however , if it follows the relation postulated by tauris & savonije in 1999@xcite , then the companion mass @xmath14 , which is qualitatively consistent with the observed spectral properties . given the mass ratio this results in a pulsar mass @xmath15 and an orbital inclination @xmath16 .",
    "apart from resulting in a reasonable value for @xmath17 , the low inclination is consistent with the non - detection of the shapiro delay .",
    "furthermore , when we introduce shapiro delay parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 in our solution , the apparent eccentricity diminishes to an insignificant level of @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that the difference between the semi - major and semi - minor axes is only @xmath21 !",
    "if these values for @xmath18 and @xmath17 hold , the orbital decay due to the emission of quadrupolar gravitational waves predicted by general relativity is @xmath22 .",
    "this is consistent with the intrinsic orbital decay @xmath23 .",
    "subtracting @xmath24 from @xmath23 we obtain an `` excess '' of @xmath25 . following the logic of lazaridis et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) , we can combine this `` excess '' with that from a pulsar with a longer orbital period , like psr  j0437@xmath264715 @xcite , and derive joint limits for the variation of the gravitational constant @xmath27 and the dipolar gravitational wave emission constant @xmath28 . in figure",
    "[ fig : limits ] , we can see that , provided that the companion mass estimate is realistic , psr  j1738 + 0333 already provides excellent limits on dipolar gravitational wave emission : @xmath29 ( 1-@xmath8 ) and @xmath30 ( 2-@xmath8 ) .",
    "this happens despite it having a baseline that is only half that of psr  j1012 + 5307 : this is more than compensated by its shorter orbital period and better timing precision .",
    "this also means that the measurement of @xmath23 will keep improving much faster for psr  j1738 + 0333 in the future .",
    "one of the consequences is that , if we assume general relativity to hold ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) , we will obtain precise values for @xmath18 , @xmath17 and @xmath32 from the measurements of @xmath24 and @xmath33 .",
    "these will help to calibrate the spectral models of low - mass wds ."
