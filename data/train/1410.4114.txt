    "the far scrape - off layer of magnetically confined plasmas is dominated by intermittent fluctuations of the particle density and concomitant large transport events .",
    "a large body of research links these phenomena to the radial propagation of plasma filaments which are elongated along the magnetic field and localized in the radial - poloidal plane .",
    "they carry excess particle density and heat relative to the background plasma and are hence called _ blobs _ blobs are believed to mediate the parallel and perpendicular transport channels of particle and heat fluxes in the scrape - off layer .",
    "furthermore may blob propagation be responsible for a significant heat load on plasma facing components of the vacuum vessel .",
    "as the empirical discharge density limit [ ] is approached , the relative magnitude of these transport channels changes such as to favor perpendicular transport [ ] . to understand the impact of blobby transport on plasma confinement , their mode of propagation as well as the statistics of fluctuation induced transport have to be studied .",
    "the basic mechanism underlying plasma blob propagation is the interchange mechanism .",
    "magnetic gradient and curvature drifts in an inhomogeneous magnetic field give rise to an electric current which polarizes filament structures of elevated pressure perpendicular to the magnetic field and its direction of variation . at the outboard mid - plane location of a toroidally magnetized plasma ,",
    "a filament of elevated pressure is polarized in such a way that it propagates radially outwards towards the main chamber wall [ ] .",
    "the path along which electric currents within the filament are closed are crucial for its radial velocity . assuming that the electric current in the plasma filament can flow freely along magnetic field lines within the plasma filament , the electric current loop may be closed through these sheaths .",
    "two - dimensional fluid simulations of isolated plasma blob propagation reveal that the radial blob velocity decreases with increasing magnitude of the parallel electric currents , parameterized by a sheath dissipation parameter [ ] .",
    "sheath connection is expected to be limited by ballooning of the plasma filaments and large plasma resistivity which prevents parallel electric currents through the sheaths [ ] .",
    "fluid modeling of plasma blobs furthermore reveals a dependence of its radial velocity , @xmath3 , on the relative blob amplitude , where blobs with larger amplitude feature a larger radial center of mass velocity [ ] .",
    "studies of plasma blob propagation in alcator c - mod show a good agreement between their radial velocity and the sheath - connected velocity scaling law when the scrape - off layer is sheath - limited [ ] .",
    "work at alcator c - mod furthermore reveals correlation coefficients of up to 75% between time series of particle density proxies , sampled at different poloidal positions along a single magnetic field line [ ] .",
    "this supports the idea that blobs in alcator c - mod may extend from the outboard mid - plane to the divertor sheaths and are sheath connected in suitable low - density plasmas .",
    "the turbulent flows in the far scrape - off layer of magnetically confined plasmas have been demonstrated to have many universal properties [ ] .",
    "for one , the conditionally averaged waveform of large amplitude events in particle density time series presents a fast rise and a slow fall [ ] .",
    "the conditionally averaged waveform as well as the histogram of ion saturation current time series were found to collapse upon normalization for a range of line - averaged plasma densities and plasma currents in the _ tokamak  configuration variable _ ( tcv ) tokamak [ ] .",
    "exponentially distributed burst amplitudes and waiting times have been observed in the scrape - off layer of alcator c - mod and tcv [ ] .",
    "correlation analysis further reveals the presence of a dipolar electric potential structure centered around local maxima of the particle density [ ] .",
    "time series with frequent large amplitude bursts feature histograms with elevated tails as well as positive coefficients of sample skewness and excess kurtosis [ ] .",
    "the universal character of the fluctuations manifests itself in the fact that histograms of the particle density coincide upon normalization when obtained at a single position in the far scrape - off layer for various plasma parameters [ ] .",
    "particle density fluctuations in the scrape - off layer sampled at the tcv device were also found to be well described by a gamma and a log - normal distribution over a large range of discharge parameters [ ] .",
    "another salient feature of the density time series is a quadratic relation between sample skewness , @xmath4 , and excess kurtosis , @xmath5 , of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are real coefficients [ ] .",
    "this relation is intrinsic to some probability distribution functions that have been proposed to describe histograms of the particle density time series .",
    "data sampled in the torpex device over a large range of discharge conditions and spatial locations was shown to be well described by the generalized beta distribution [ ] .",
    "recent work models particle density time series as a stochastic process which is based on the superposition of individual pulses [ ] . under the assumption that the individual pulses decay exponentially , have exponentially distributed amplitudes and waiting times between pulses",
    ", this model predicts the particle density time series to be gamma distributed .",
    "it was shown that this model describes the intensity fluctuations at the outboard mid - plane scrape - off layer of alcator c - mod , as measured by gas - puff imaging , over several decades in normalized probability [ ] .",
    "so far however , no consensus on one particular analytic model exists in the fusion community . in this paper , we present an analysis of long time series of the ion saturation current and floating potential obtained by langmuir probes in the boundary region of the alcator c - mod tokamak . utilizing a probe dwelled in the outboard mid - plane scrape - off layer as well as probes embedded in the divertor baffle allows us to study the universality of the fluctuations sampled at these two positions as well as the dependence of the statistics on the line - averaged plasma density .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : fluct_stat ] introduces a stochastic model for density fluctuations in the scrape - off layer as well as the conditional averaging method to be used .",
    "the experimental setup is described in section [ sec : setup ] .",
    "section [ sec : sol_results ] presents the time series analysis data sampled by the probe in the outboard mid - plane scrape - off layer and section [ sec : div_fluct ] presents the corresponding analysis of the time series obtained from the divertor probes .",
    "a discussion of the universal properties of the time series sampled in both positions and their relation to blob theory are given in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] with suggestions for further work .",
    "recent work models the particle density fluctuations at a single point in scrape - off layer plasmas as the superposition of random pulse events [ ] : @xmath9 given that the arrival of pulses in the time series is governed by a poisson process , this model predicts a quadratic relation between coefficients of skewness and excess kurtosis .",
    "moreover , by assuming a poisson distribution it follows that the waiting time between pulses are exponentially distributed . further assuming an exponential pulse shape , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the heaviside step function and @xmath12 the duration time of a pulse , and exponentially distributed pulse amplitudes @xmath13 , the model implies that the particle density is gamma distributed [ ] .",
    "the ratio of pulse duration time and waiting times , @xmath14 , is the shape parameter of the gamma distribution .    to include random fluctuations of the background particle density",
    "we add normal distributed noise to the signal eqn .  , @xmath15 here the normal distributed noise @xmath16 has vanishing mean and variance @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting probability density function of the random variable is then given by the convolution of a @xmath18-distribution and a normal distribution and can be written using two parameters : @xmath19 and @xmath20 . while @xmath19 relates to the ratio of pulse decay and waiting time as before , in other words the density of pulse arrivals",
    ", @xmath20 relates the variance of @xmath16 to the root mean square value of @xmath21 via @xmath22 .",
    "a large value of @xmath20 denotes the case where the root mean square value of the process @xmath21 is smaller than the scale parameter of the white noise @xmath16 and a small value of @xmath20 denotes the converse relation .",
    "it is commonly observed in particle density fluctuation time series in scrape - off layer plasmas that pulses overlap as to form large amplitude burst events . to determine the average structure of the bursts we employ conditional averaging [ ] . starting from the largest burst event in the time series at hand",
    ", we identify a set of disjunct sub records , placed symmetrically around the peak of burst events which exceed a given amplitude threshold until no more burst events exceeding this threshold are left uncovered . the threshold is often chosen to be @xmath23 times the root mean square value of the time series at hand .",
    "this average can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the time offset relative to the peak of the burst .",
    "the variability of the burst events is characterized by the conditional variance [ ] : @xmath26 this quantity is bounded , @xmath27 , where the values @xmath28 and @xmath29 indicate respectively no and perfect reproducibility of the conditionally averaged waveform .    to study the intermittency of ion saturation current time series , they are rescaled according to @xmath30",
    "the subscripts @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the moving average and moving root mean square value respectively .",
    "both are computed within a window of @xmath33 elements when applied to data from the horizontal scanning probe .",
    "this window corresponds to roughly @xmath34 and exceeds typical autocorrelation times of approximately @xmath35 by a factor of @xmath36 [ ] . the same window length is used for the time series obtained by the divertor probes . in the latter case",
    ", this corresponds to approximately @xmath37 .",
    "since the amplitude of the density fluctuation in the scrape - off layer is sensitive to the distance to the last closed flux surface we compute the statistics within a moving window as to alleviate the fluctuations of the last closed flux surface indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : probes_rho ] .",
    "the use of such averaging has little influence on the conditional averaging threshold eqn .  .",
    "time series of the floating potential are rescaled by removing a linear trend from the time series and subsequently normalizing the time series to the electron temperature and as to have vanishing mean : @xmath38 we do not use a moving average for the floating potential since the amplitude of the signal varies little with distance to the last closed flux surface .",
    "alcator c - mod is a compact tokamak with a major radius of @xmath39 and a minor radius of @xmath40 , and allows for a magnetic field of up to @xmath41 on - axis .",
    "figure [ fig : acm_cross ] shows a cross - section of alcator c - mod together with the diagnostics from which we report measurements : the horizontal and vertical scanning probes and the langmuir probe array embedded in the lower outer divertor baffle .",
    "the magnetic equilibrium from discharge 2 of tab .",
    "[ tab : shotparams ] , as reconstructed by efit [ ] , is overlaid .",
    "the mach probe head installed on both scanning probes , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mach_head ] , is designed to routinely withstand heat fluxes of up to @xmath42 [ ] .",
    "all electrodes are connected to sampling electronics that sample current and voltage with @xmath43 and @xmath44 bit resolution .",
    "the horizontal scanning probe is installed @xmath45 above the outboard mid - plane and can be reciprocated horizontally @xmath46 into the plasma . for the present experiments this probe was dwelled at a fixed position in the scrape - off layer for the entire duration of the plasma discharge . as a common radial coordinate we employ the magnetic flux label @xmath47 , which gives the distance to the last - closed flux surface ( lcfs ) as mapped to the outboard mid - plane along magnetic field lines .",
    "this coordinate is calculated by magnetic equilibrium reconstruction with the efit code using input from a set of magnetic diagnostics installed in the vacuum vessel [ ] . for positions in the near and far scrape - off layer , the probe was targeted to dwell at @xmath48 and at @xmath49 respectively . the north - east ( ne ) and south - east ( se ) electrodes were biased to @xmath50 with respect to the vacuum vessel in order to sample the ion saturation current . the south - west ( sw ) and north - west ( nw ) electrodes were electrically floating .",
    "this allows to estimate the poloidal electric field from these electrodes as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the poloidal separation between the electrodes .",
    "the vertical scanning probe was set up to plunge through the scrape - off layer up to the last closed flux surface , as depicted by the vertical line in fig .",

    "a triangular voltage waveform , sweeping from @xmath53 to @xmath54 with a frequency of @xmath55 was applied to all four electrodes of the probe head .",
    "the electron temperature @xmath56 is obtained by fitting a three parameter exponential function on the measured voltage - current characteristic of each probe head with a spatial resolution of @xmath57 [ ] .",
    "the langmuir probe array embedded in the lower divertor baffle consists of two electrodes per probe which were configured to sample the ion saturation current and floating potential respectively with @xmath58 with @xmath59 bit resolution . in the targeted magnetic equilibrium configuration the two outermost divertor probes map to @xmath60 .",
    "this corresponds to the approximate position where the horizontal scanning probe was dwelled in the far scrape - off layer within error margins of @xmath61 .",
    "we report from measurements obtained in 5 ohmically heated plasmas in a lower single null magnetic geometry with @xmath62 on - axis magnetic field and a plasma current of @xmath63 . for all discharges",
    "it was attempted to minimize the movement of the strike point of the last closed flux surface on the lower divertor baffle . as a consequence ,",
    "the estimated position of the last closed flux surface at the outboard mid - plane is subject to larger fluctuations .",
    "table [ tab : shotparams ] lists the plasma parameters of all shots as well as the position of the horizontal scanning probe , the time interval on which the time series are analyzed , and the plot marker used in the following figures . the electron temperature at @xmath64 which is used to normalize the floating potential and to estimate the acoustic velocity at the position of the horizontal scanning probe is also listed . in discharge",
    "@xmath29 the horizontal scanning probe was dwelled in the near scrape - off layer , this data is not directly comparable to the far scrape - off layer data . in discharge 3 the sensitivity of the electronics of the divertor probes was not adjusted correctly such that this data is not analyzed either .",

    "the middle panel shows the radial coordinate of the probe head of the horizontal scanning probe and the lower panel shows the radial coordinates of the two outermost divertor probes .",
    "while the line - averaged plasma density is approximately constant and the radial coordinate of the divertor probes show a slight drift , the radial coordinate of the horizontal scanning probe is subject to larger fluctuations . the indicated time intervals in this figure correspond to the interval of the time series used for data analysis .",

    "typical rise times and fall times of the events in the time series sampled by the horizontal scanning probe are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , while the corresponding values for the time series sampled by the divertor probes are larger by a factor of @xmath69 .",
    "we note however that the time resolution of the divertor probes is @xmath70 which might affect the accuracy of the e - folding times negatively .",
    "the conditionally averaged structure of the time series sampled by divertor probe @xmath71 in discharge @xmath72 shows a larger asymmetry with a large fall time .",
    "however , the waveforms sampled by the divertor probes do not allow to draw conclusions about the physical dimensions of impinging plasma filaments .",
    "the recorded waveform may be due to both , a filament traversing the probe radially outwards or a filament impinging along the direction of the magnetic field on to the probe .",
    "the conditionally averaged waveforms of the normalized ion saturation current and the floating potential signal , sampled at the outboard mid - plane far scrape - off layer , support the conventional picture of plasma blob propagation through the scrape - off layer .",
    "that is , peaks in the plasma particle density are associated with a dipolar electric potential structure whose polarization gives an electric drift velocity pointing towards the vessel wall .",
    "the phase shift between the conditionally averaged waveforms of the ion saturation current and floating potential is approximately @xmath73 and the estimated radial velocities of the blobs structure are in the order of a few per cent of the ion acoustic velocity for all line averaged plasma densities .",
    "these results extend previous measurements made in the scrape off layer of alcator c - mod [ ] .",
    "a positive linear correlation is observed between the estimated radial blob velocities and their normalized amplitude , with pearson sample correlation coefficients given by @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "a possible explanation for this correlation is that the pressure gradient within the blob structure increases with filament amplitude .",
    "fluid modeling of isolated plasma filaments shows that the magnitude of the plasma pressure gradient increases the plasma vorticity associated with the plasma blob [ ] .",
    "assuming that the poloidal size of the plasma blobs is constant [ ] , this creates a larger electric field which in turn increases the electric drift magnitude .",
    "a simple estimate of parallel and perpendicular transport for a filament , see for example fig .",
    "@xmath78 in [ ] , suggests that the bursts in the time series sampled by the divertor probes may be due to plasma filaments impinging in the probes . for this",
    "we note that potential variations may also be caused by the internal temperature profile of plasma blobs [ ] .",
    "for @xmath79 we evaluate the electron thermal velocity to be @xmath80 and the ion acoustic velocity in a deuterium plasma to be @xmath81 . a lower bound on the characteristic velocity associated with transport of potential perturbations along the magnetic field is given by @xmath82 [ ] . given a connection length of @xmath83",
    ", the particles and potential generated by a blob ballooned on the low - field side will reach the divertor targets after @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "assuming that the blob is instantiated as a structure with sharp modulation along a flux tube and that it propagates normal to the flux tube at @xmath86 , independent of poloidal angle , the time estimate above implies that the footprint of the blob has reached the divertor sheaths at radial coordinates given by @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this interpretation is compatible with previous results from correlation analysis of particle density proxies along single field lines in alcator c - mod and nstx [ ] .",
    "neglecting electron temperature fluctuations , a dipolar potential structure measured by the divertor probes may be interpreted as the footprint of a plasma blob .",
    "when this is the case , the radial velocity scaling of the plasma filaments falls in the sheath connected regime . on the other hand",
    ", a random waveform implies that the electric current loop within a plasma filament closes upstream of the divertor . on the other hand ,",
    "random structures have been observed in numerical simulations of plasma blobs where the late blob has dispersed by rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities [ ] and in three - dimensional simulations , where no coherent structure of the late blob is recognizable [ ] .",
    "the hypothesis that the blobs are not electrically connected to the sheaths in discharge 5 is however also compatible with measurements of radial blob velocities in high density plasmas in alcator c - mod , which indicate that the radial filament velocity at the outboard mid - plane increases with increasing line - averaged density and exceed the value predicted for sheath connected blobs [ ] .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by histograms of the radial particle flux in the outboard mid - plane far scrape - off layer , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_flux_normalized ] . upon proper normalization , the histograms for discharges @xmath69 , @xmath78 , and @xmath89 collapse , while the histogram for discharge @xmath72 features a more elevated tail .",
    "all histograms feature exponential tails for both the positive and the negative abscissa . the average radial particle flux increases by a factor of approximately @xmath90 from the discharge with @xmath75 to the discharge with @xmath77 .",
    "this increase of the radial particle flux with line - averaged plasma density is consistent with previous experiments in the alcator c - mod tokamak [ ] as well as with experiments performcd in the tcv tokamak [ ] .",
    "the higher frequency of large flux events is consistent with the observation that blobs are moving faster while their cross - field size diameter remains constant [ ] .",
    "another possible explanation for the high average radial particle flux in discharge 5 may be increased levels of temperature fluctuations due to plasma filaments .    the effective convective velocity , @xmath91 , also increases with the line - averaged plasma density . for discharge 2",
    "we find @xmath92 , while we find @xmath93 for discharge 3 and 4 . for discharge @xmath72 with @xmath77",
    "we find @xmath94 .",
    "such an increase in effective convective velocity is consistent with flux measurements done in the alcator c - mod tokamak [ ] .",
    "the values we find for @xmath95 are furthermore in the same order of magnitude as measured in the tore supra device [ ] and in tcv [ ] .",
    "to conclude , we have studied the dependence of fluctuations in scrape - off layer plasmas on the line - averaged particle density , as measured by langmuir probes at the outboard mid - plane location and embedded in the outer divertor of alcator c - mod .",
    "time series of ion saturation current , sampled in the far - scrape off layer , all feature dynamics which is governed by the intermittent arrival of large amplitude burst events .",
    "waiting times between large amplitude burst events are well described by an exponential distribution .",
    "sub records of the time series feature a quadratic relation between coefficients of sample skewness and sample excess kurtosis .",
    "the fact that large - amplitude events occur uncorrelated and the quadratic relation between sample skewness and excess kurtosis , support assumptions of a stochastic model for the density fluctuations in scrape - off layer plasmas .",
    "the probability density function of this model describes the histograms of all sampled ion saturation current time series well .",
    "the conditionally averaged waveform of the associated potential fluctuations is dipolar , except for time series sampled in the divertor plasma where the divertor is detached .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that plasma blobs are electrically detached in sufficiently high density plasmas and may explain the observed increase in radial blob velocity with line - averaged plasma density [ ] .",
    "electric disconnection of the plasma blobs from the divertor sheaths may also explain recent experiments performed at the asdex upgrade tokamak where it was observed that the radial blob velocity and cross - field diameter increases as the divertor detaches [ ] .",
    "future work will include a more detailed comparison of the stochastic model to time series measured in scrape - off layer plasmas .",

    "<S> we study long time series of the ion saturation current and floating potential , sampled by langmuir probes dwelled in the outboard mid - plane scrape off layer and embedded in the lower divertor baffle of alcator c - mod . </S>",
    "<S> a series of ohmically heated l - mode plasma discharges is investigated with line - averaged plasma density ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the greenwald density . </S>",
    "<S> all ion saturation current time series that are sampled in the far scrape - off layer are characterized by large - amplitude burst events . </S>",
    "<S> coefficients of skewness and excess kurtosis of the time series obey a quadratic relationship and their histograms coincide partially upon proper normalization . </S>",
    "<S> histograms of the ion saturation current time series are found to agree well with a prediction of a stochastic model for the particle density fluctuations in scrape - off layer plasmas .    </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the waiting times between successive large - amplitude burst events and of the burst amplitudes are approximately described by exponential distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the average waiting time and burst amplitude are found to vary weakly with the line - averaged plasma density . </S>",
    "<S> conditional averaging reveals that the radial blob velocity , estimated from floating potential measurements , increases with the normalized burst amplitude in the outboard mid - plane scrape - off layer . for low density discharges , </S>",
    "<S> the conditionally averaged waveform of the floating potential associated with large amplitude bursts at the divertor probes has a dipolar shape . in detached divertor conditions the average waveform is random , indicating electrical disconnection of blobs from the sheaths at the divertor targets </S>"
