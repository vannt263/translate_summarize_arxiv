    "in hadron collisions determination of this frame is difficult because the direction of the @xmath9 that decayed from the @xmath10 is unknown . therefore instead , the charge - signed rapidity difference@xcite defined to be @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the charge of the @xmath13 decayed from the @xmath10 and @xmath14 is the @xmath15 rapidity difference ) is used . at the tevatron ,",
