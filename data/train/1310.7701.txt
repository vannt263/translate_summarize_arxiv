    "eso  323g77 ( @xmath12 ) is an optically bright ( @xmath13  mag ) seyfert  1 galaxy originally reported as an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) by fairall ( 1986 ) .",
    "the nuclear spectrum indicates significant reddening with @xmath14 ( winkler 1992 ; winkler et al .",
    "1992 ) , a property that is often observed in seyfert  1 galaxies showing a high level of optical polarisation such as e.g. mrk  231 and fairall  51 ( see smith et al . 1995 ; schmid et al .",

    "schmid et al .",
    "( 2003 ) report the detection of high linear polarisation in eso  323g77 , ranging from @xmath15  % at 8300    to @xmath16  % at 3600    for the continuum .",
    "similar amounts of polarisation are found for the broad emission lines .",
    "the position angle of the polarisation does not depend on wavelength , and it is found to be perpendicular to the orientation of the [ o  iii ] ionization cone of the galaxy .",
    "this suggests that eso  323g77 is observed at an intermediate inclination of @xmath17 with respect to the symmetry axis .",
    "hence , eso  323g77 appears to be a borderline seyfert  1 galaxy , seen at an inclination that is intermediate between the typical orientation of seyfert  1 and seyfert  2 galaxies , a viewing angle that is likely grazing the obscuring medium ( the so  called torus of unified models , antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "if this is the case , then one generally expects that more centrally  concentrated emitting regions ( i.e. x  rays ) will show a higher level of obscuration than more extended ones ( e.g. optical and broad emission lines ) as the latter ( e.g. their far side ) correspond to lower observer inclination than the former .",
    "indeed , the optical extinction towards eso  323g77 , as obtained by winkler ( 1992 ) from the observed balmer decrement , corresponds to a column density of @xmath18  @xmath1 ( e.g. gver & zel 2009 ) , much lower than the x  ray  derived one , which is more than one order of magnitude higher ( jimnez  bailn et al .",

    "[ varrange ] , we show the remaining _ swift _ observations ( 2,3 , and 4 in table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the reason to show them in a different panel is twofold : firstly , the spectral shape during the _ swift _ observations is almost coincident with that during the _ xmm  newton _ ones ( observations 2 and 10 are similar , as are observations 3 , 4 , and 1 ) , so that the _ swift _ data are shown separately for clarity ; secondly , the _ swift _ observations reveal the fastest variability event of the overall monitoring and are then worth special attention : as seen in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ varrange ] , observation 2 ( black ) is significantly more absorbed than observation 3 ( red ) which was performed @xmath24  months after .      in order to define a global spectral model to be applied to all multi  epoch data ,",
    "we first consider the two _ xmm  newton _ observations 1 and 10 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) which have the highest spectral quality .",
    "hereafter , we consider the x  ray data in the 0.510  kev band , unless specified otherwise .",
    "spectral analysis is performed using the v12.7 software ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we start our analysis by defining a phenomenological , typical seyfert  2like spectral model comprising , besides galactic absorption ( applied to all components with @xmath25  @xmath1 , see kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) , an intrinsic agn power law nuclear continuum absorbed by a column density @xmath26 at the redshift of eso  323g77 , a gaussian emission line at rest  frame @xmath27  kev describing fe k@xmath28 emission , and a soft power",
    " law which is only absorbed by the galactic column density and represents the scattered component that is often associated with soft x  ray emission lines in the x  ray spectra of obscured agn ( e.g. bianchi et al . 2005",

    "we force the continuum spectral index to be the same during both observations , deferring a discussion about this hypothesis to a later stage . as soft x ",
    "ray emission in obscured agn likely originates in an extended region ( possibly the narrow line region , see bianchi , guainazzi & chiaberge 2006 , as well as star  forming regions in the host galaxy ) , we force the soft power law normalisation to be the same at both epochs , and we also assume the same spectral index as that of the continuum .",
    "all the other parameters are allowed to vary independently .",
    "the model , which can be thought of as a rather typical seyfert  2 spectral model , is not successful in describing the data resulting into @xmath29 for 1450 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the data , spectral models , and data  to  model ratio for both observations are shown in fig .",
    "[ ratiobad ] .",
    "important residuals are left in both observations around 0.9  kev pointing to the presence of a further soft ( and constant ) emission component . on the other hand ,",
    "the two spectra differ significantly around 24  kev and in the fe k band .",
    "in particular , the overall hard x  ray spectral shape of the more absorbed _",
    "xmm  newton _",
    "observation 10 is not at all well described by our model .    as a first step , in order to account for the common residuals around 0.9  kev , we add an optically  thin plasma emission model , representing phenomenologically the soft x  ray contribution from either photo  ionized or collisionally  ionized gas ( we use the model in , smith et al .",
    "the normalisation is assumed to be the same at the two epochs , as the model is physically associated with extended emission .",
    "the fitting statistic improves significantly with @xmath30 for 1448 dof for a plasma temperature of @xmath31  kev . adding a second component results in a better statistic with @xmath32 for 1446 for a temperature of @xmath33  kev .",

    "[ ratiobad ] almost completely .    as already pointed out by jimnez ",
    "bailn et al . ( 2008a ) , the _ xmm  newton _ observation 1 exhibits blueshifted absorption lines in the fe k band that these authors model with two highly ionized outflowing absorbers .",
    "we then first add one ionized , outflowing absorber to our overall model using the model ( reeves et al .",
    "2008 ) in assuming a covering fraction of unity . for simplicity",
    ", we force the same absorber parameters ( column density and ionization ) at both epochs , deferring the analysis of the ionized absorber variability to a later stage , once a satisfactory global spectral model is found .",
    "the fit improves significantly with @xmath35 for 1443 . adding the second highly ",
    "ionized absorber identified by jimnez ",
    "bailn et al . (",
    "2008a ) further improves the statistic to @xmath36 for 1440 .",
    "the absorbers are both highly  ionized ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and outflowing with velocities of @xmath10  km  s@xmath11 ( measured by letting the redshift parameter free to vary ) , in good agreement with previous results .    as for the emission components in the fe k band , the fe k emission",
    "is generally associated with an x  ray reflection continuum .",
    "we then remove the gaussian line and add a model ( nandra et al .",
    "2007 ) which self  consistently describes the reflection continuum and most important emission lines arising from an illuminated slab of optically  thick gas . as our spectral fits suggest that the fe emission line has constant intensity with @xmath39  ph  @xmath1  s@xmath11 and @xmath40  ph  @xmath1  s@xmath11 , we force all parameters to be the same at both epochs .",
    "we convolve the reflection model with a gaussian kernel to allow for some non  zero width of the emission lines .",
    "the illuminating spectral index is set to be the same as that of the intrinsic continuum , we assume solar abundances and an inclination of @xmath41 , so that the only free parameter of the reflection model is its normalisation ( which is the same at both epochs ) .",
    "as we assume constant reflection , the reflection fraction @xmath42 varies with the source intrinsic flux . as an example , we here report its value ( @xmath43 ) for observation 1 only .",
    "the statistical description of the data improves to @xmath44 for 1442 dof ( to be compared with @xmath45 for 1440 dof when the simpler gaussian emission  line model was used ) .",
    "however , as for all the models used above , the 24  kev residuals of observation 10 shown in fig .",
    "[ ratiobad ] are not accounted for .    after a series of further tests , we find that the data can be described at both epochs with the addition of a further power law absorbed by a column density different than that the primary one , whose physical nature is discussed in section  [ scattexpla ] .",
    "the normalisation of this component is allowed to vary between the two epochs .",
    "the statistical description of the data is now excellent with a @xmath46 for 1438 dof . as the additional power law is absorbed by two column densities that are consistent with each other in the two observations ( and of the order of @xmath47  @xmath1 ) , we force the column density to be the same at both epochs which results into @xmath48 for 1439 dof . the best ",
    "fitting models for both observations are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ models ] . in the lower panel ,",
    "we show the total best  fitting model for the more absorbed _ xmm  newton _ observation 10 , together with all spectral components . in fig .",
    "[ ratios ] , we compare the residuals obtained without ( upper panel ) and with ( lower panel ) the inclusion of the additional absorbed power law component .",
    "some residuals are present around 67  kev , a possible signature of an extra  component or of some inadequacy of the absorber model .",
    "however , we refrain from modelling these residuals by adding further ad  hoc absorption / emission lines to an already complex model .",
    "the overall reduced @xmath23 is already @xmath49 so that adding more complexity to the spectral model would imply the risk of over  modelling the data ( see , however , section  [ broadfe ] for a further discussion ) .",
    "having found a good description of the x  ray spectrum of eso  323g77 , we can now critically consider some of the assumptions we made .",
    "we first allow the intrinsic spectral index to be different .",
    "however , the two spectral indices are consistent with each other with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we then consider possible variations in the warm absorber parameters .",
    "we keep the outflow velocities linked between the two epochs , and we first allow for variations in the ionization parameter only , but no improvement is obtained .",
    "the same holds for variations in the warm absorbers column density .",
    "we must point out , however , that the warm absorbers have little effect on the more absorbed observation 10 , so that their properties are in fact mostly set by the less absorbed observation 1 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the only significant difference between the two spectra is a one order of magnitude variation in the column density towards the nuclear continuum ( with @xmath52  @xmath1 during the _ xmm  newton _ observation 1 and @xmath53  @xmath1 during observation 10 ) .",
    "the best  fitting parameters will be reported later on , when the multi  epoch spectral results are presented ( section  [ multi  epoch ] ) .",
    "as clear from the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ models ] , our spectral model predicts no short  timescale variability below @xmath24  kev as all soft components are expected to originate in distant material . on the other hand , the intrinsic , absorbed , nuclear continuum dominates in the 410  kev band so that some variability may be in principle expected . as for the additional absorbed power law",
    ", this component dominates in the intermediate 24  kev band .",
    "the _ xmm  newton _",
    "observation 10 is long enough ( @xmath54  ks ) to investigate the short  timescale variability in different energy bands .",
    "we use light curves with 5000  s bins to compute the rms variability amplitude in the following energy bands : 0.51  kev , 12  kev , 24  kev , 46  kev , and 811  kev .",
    "we avoid the 68  kev band because this spectral range is not dominated by one single component , bearing contributions from continuum , reflection , and from the additional power law .",
    "all rms variability amplitudes are consistent with zero , except that in the 46  kev and 811  kev bands that are dominated by the absorbed intrinsic continuum .",
    "for those bands , we measure a rms variability amplitude of @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the variability properties provide support to our spectral model , indicating that short  timescale variability is only present in energy bands that are dominated by the nuclear continuum",
    ". moreover , the energy  dependent variability also shows that the additional absorbed power law dominating the 24  kev band ( see fig .  [ models ] , lower panel ) is less variable than the intrinsic continuum .",
    "this is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ shortvar ] , where the light curves in the continuum  dominated 46  kev and 811  kev energy bands band ( upper and lower curves ) are compared with that in the 24  kev band ( middle curve ) , which is dominated by the additional absorbed power law component .",
    "the observed short ",
    "timescale variability in the continuum  dominated bands can also be used to investigate whether intra  observation x  ray absorption variability is present . as seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ models ] , the 811  kev band is ( almost ) insensitive to column density variations , while the softer 46  kev band is instead sensitive to variations of @xmath56 .",
    "hence , the ratio between the two energy bands can highlight any intra ",
    "observation spectral variability due to absorption changes .",
    "the ratio of the 811  kev to the 46  kev band light curves is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ shortvar ] .",
    "no spectral variability is detected , and the ratio is consistent with being constant throughout the observation ( a fit with a constant produces @xmath57 for 23 dof ) .",
    "we then conclude that no intra  observation absorption variability is detected during the 120  ks exposure of observation 10 .      the best  fitting spectral components shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ models ] are all typical of the x  ray spectra of agn except the additional absorbed power law component that we introduced to account for the 24  kev residuals during the more absorbed _ xmm  newton _ observation 10 ( see e.g. fig .  [ models ] and fig .",
    "[ ratios ] ) .",
    "hence , the inclusion of such additional component deserves some more detailed physical explanation .",
    "we interpret this component as scattering of the nuclear continuum in a clumpy absorber . indeed ,",
    "if the absorber is clumpy , the observed continuum comprises a transmitted component , namely an absorbed power law with column density set by that of the particular clump ( or clumps ) that happens to be on our line of sight ( los ) , plus a scattering component due to clumps out of the los that intercept and scatter the nuclear continuum , re  directing part of it into our los . as this component likely arises from a number of different clumps , the scattered component is absorbed by the average column density of the clumpy absorber rather than that of one particular clump , which explains why the column density towards the transmitted and scattered components may be different and why the column density towards the scattered component is consistent with being always the same ( see e.g. yaqoob 2012 for a detailed discussion of the envisaged geometry , in particular his fig .  2 and section  7 ) .",
    "modelling the scattered component with a simple absorbed power law is only a zeroth ",
    "order approximation of the likely spectral shape which encodes our ignorance of the true scattering geometry .",
    "notice that our scattering interpretation is consistent with the lower variability amplitude ( if any is present ) of the 24  kev band with respect to energy bands that are dominated by the continuum , as scattering in a relatively extended medium tends to wash out any intrinsic variability .",
    "if our interpretation is correct , the scattering component is likely to be a fixed fraction of the intrinsic continuum , representing the scattering efficiency for a given geometry and physical condition of the scattering medium . to test this further hypothesis",
    "we modify our best  fitting model for the _ xmm  newton _ observations 1 and 10 forcing the scattered continuum to be a constant fraction of the intrinsic nuclear continuum in both observations .",
    "we indeed find that the scattered component is consistent with a constant fraction ( @xmath58  % ) of the nuclear continuum , with a final statistic of @xmath59 for 1440 dof , to be compared with @xmath60 for 1439 dof when the scattered component is free to vary independently .",
    "as the two fits are statistically equivalent , we retain this further assumption in subsequent analysis . in summary ,",
    "our interpretation suggests the presence of a variable , clumpy absorber whose properties can be investigated in great detail thanks to the remarkable absorption variability of eso  323g77 ( see fig .  [ varrange ] ) .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is devoted precisely to this goal .      before proceeding with a multi ",
    "epoch spectral analysis of all available x  ray observations , we point out that the _ suzaku _ observation 9 on 2011/07 deserves some dedicated study . as clear from fig .",
    "[ varrange ] ( upper panel ) , the suzaku observation is reflection  dominated with a very prominent fe k@xmath28 emission line whose equivalent width is @xmath61  ev . however , the xis data ( up to 10  kev ) can not discriminate between two different scenarios that can give rise to reflection  dominated spectra , namely a compton ",
    "thick state where the nuclear continuum is heavily absorbed only marginally contributing below 10  kev , or a switched  off state where the nuclear continuum is extremely dim , only leaving the reprocessed components below 10  kev .    in principle , _ suzaku _ is the ideal observatory to accurately measure the column density towards absorbed agn thanks to the presence of the hxd and , in particular , the pin detector with good sensitivity up to tens of kev .",
    "however , the large ( @xmath62 ) field  of  view ( fov ) of the hxd implies that the pin x  ray data are contaminated by the nearby and relatively x  ray bright agn eso  323g81 , which is only @xmath63 away from eso  323g77 .",
    "no other relatively bright x  ray source is known within the hxd fov . as such , we extract the spectra of both eso  323g77 and eso  323g81 from the xis0 detector using circular regions of same radius ( limited to @xmath64 due to the position of eso  323g81 , close to the xis0 detector edge ) .",
    "we then build an overall spectral model for both eso  323g77 ( for which we use the same model described in the previous section ) and for eso  323g81 which is well described by a rather typical seyfert  1 x  ray model comprising galactic absorption , a power law continuum , a distant reflection component , and a soft excess that we model here phenomenologically with a simple blackbody .",
    "hereafter , the spectral models for eso  323g77 and eso  323g81 are called model a and b respectively .",
    "we then fit the xis  0 spectra of both sources simultaneously with the pin spectrum , which comprises contributions from both .",
    "the xis0 spectrum of eso  323g77 is described with model a , the xis0 spectrum of eso  323g81 with model b , and the pin spectrum with model a+b .",
    "we fix the pin / xis0 cross  calibration constant to the value of 1.16 for eso  323g77 , which is appropriate for observations performed at the xis nominal position . the position of eso  323g81 ( close to the west edge of the xis detectors ) falls closer to the hxd nominal position .",
    "hence we use a cross  calibration constant of 1.18 ( the value appropriate for the hxd nominal position ) for eso  323g81 .",
    "however , we must point out that our results are basically insensitive to this conservative choice .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ suzakufigs ] we show the xis0 spectra of eso  323g77 and eso  323g81 , together with the pin spectrum and the corresponding best  fitting model(s ) .",
    "the dotted line represents the extrapolation of model b ( the best ",
    "fitting model for eso  323g81 ) in the pin band and highlights the hard x  ray excess that we attribute to eso  323g77 .",
    "the extrapolation of model b to the pin band suggests that eso  323g81 has a 1540  kev flux of @xmath65  erg  s@xmath11  @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed pin flux is @xmath66  erg  s@xmath11  @xmath1 in the same band , i.e. more than a factor of 2 higher . in the bottom panel fig .",

    "in such situation , scattering can arise in the clumpy torus itself , from los with higher inclination than ours , so that the scattered component emission reasonably intercepts more clumps than the intrinsic nuclear continuum ( e.g. the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] ) .",
    "indeed , we measure a column density of @xmath186  @xmath1 towards the scattered component , and a ( variable ) column density of @xmath187  @xmath1 towards the nuclear continuum , possibly indicating that the scattered component goes through more absorbing clouds than the nuclear emission into our los .",

    "* blr clouds : * blr clouds are instead responsible for x  ray absorption with column density of the order of @xmath319  @xmath1 .",
    "the x  ray variability can be used to infer a typical blr cloud size @xmath320  cm with a typical number density @xmath321  @xmath5 , in line with the density that is needed to efficiently produce the optical / uv broad emission lines .",
    "the derived number density is slightly lower than that inferred from occultation events in e.g. ngc  1365 and mrk  766 ( e.g. risaliti et al .",
    "2009 ; 2011 ) and may imply that absorption in eso  323g77 occurs in the outer blr , closer to the dust sublimation radius than in ngc  1365 and mrk  766 .",
