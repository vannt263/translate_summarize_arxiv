    "the nature of quantum entanglement has been pursued almost since the inception of quantum mechanics itself . whereas the early insights of schrdinger , as well as of einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite were framed in the _ gedankenexperiment _ mode of discussion with continuous degrees of freedom ( particle position and momentum eigenstates ) , the issues were taken up quantitatively in bell s theorem @xcite for the case of spin degrees of freedom , via the transcription to this context given by bohm @xcite .",
    "however , continuous variable ( cv ) systems are the natural framework for most quantum optics and quantum communication work @xcite , and bell , and the more general clauser , horne , shimony and holt ( chsh ) inequalities @xcite , are important measures of entanglement .",
    "a technical difficulty in working with continuous variables is that the theoretical ideal epr type states are singular , whereas experimental investigations require regularised states . in the bipartite case",
    "these may be provided by so - called nopa squeezed states @xcite in the large squeezing limit . in an alternative approach , fan and klauder @xcite constructed somewhat more general classes of epr states , but without providing a regularisation .    in the extension to multipartite cases ,",
    "a natural question is the choice of relative variables , chosen from amongst the positions and momenta of the constituent particles of the system , which will provide an appropriate generalisation of the bipartite epr states ( with or without regularisation ) .",
    "one possibility is provided by the multipartite greenberger - horne - zeilinger nopa - like squeezed states @xcite .",
    "these have the virtue of experimental accessibility @xcite , and do show singular behaviour in the large squeezing limit which moreover leads to violations of the multipartite chsh inequalities @xcite . for a derivation of the chsh inequalities for @xmath12-particle systems",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "however , many other choices of relative variables exist ",
    "see for example @xcite and references therein .    in this paper",
    "we take up a logical generalisation of the original epr suggestion , in selecting simultaneously diagonalisable joint degrees of freedom from amongst the canonical jacobi relative coordinates of the particles .",
    " 2 is divided into two subsections . in the first we introduce the bipartite fan and klauder epr - like state and",
    "propose a possible regularisation .",
    "this is shown to be identical to the bipartite nopa state ( which approximates the ideal epr limit ) with squeezing parameter @xmath13 .",
    "in fact the correspondence is that our regularisation @xmath9 coincides with @xmath14 as @xmath13 , with @xmath15 . in the bipartite case the fan and klauder states",
    "are more general than the original epr states in that they realise explicit nonzero eigenvalues of total or relative positions and momenta ; but a study of the wigner functions reveals that such nonzero eigenvalues can be absorbed into shifts of the complex displacement parameters , and so in the bipartite case the nopa states do not lose any generality in not allowing for such nonzero eigenvectors . in the next subsection",
    "we follow the fan - klauder approach , in second quantised formalism , to derive the explicit theoretical tripartite cv states of epr type conforming to this structure , and we develop the methods to provide a plausible regularisation .    in  3 , we derive explicit wigner functions for our regularised tripartite states of epr type by interpreting the wigner functions themselves as expectation values of displaced parity measurement operators . as could be expected from their different second - quantised forms , the tripartite epr and nopa wigner functions differ significantly ( the appendix provides a comparison of the second - quantised forms and their respective wigner functions , including an explicit evaluation of the former in the nopa - like case , and a detailed derivation of the latter for our epr - type states ) . specifically , whereas the multipartite nopa wigner functions are singular in the large squeezing limit , our regularised tripartite states of epr type admit two different singular regimes : not only in the epr - type regime ( @xmath3 in our notation ) , where of course the wigner function still differs from that of nopa , but also , rather unexpectedly , for an additional , auxiliary regime of the regulator ( @xmath4 ) . in ",
    "4 we exploit the fact that wigner functions are immediately applicable as summands in the appropriate tripartite chsh inequalities .",
    "we explore the two singular regimes and their bell operator expectation values which control the classical - quantum boundary via the chsh bound ( @xmath7 ) and identify some instances of violations for each of the cases @xmath16 and @xmath17 . ",
    "5 includes further discussion of our findings , as well as comparison with the recent work @xcite , which provides a general construction of ideal epr states , and some concluding remarks .",
    "the case considered by epr in @xcite discusses the simultaneous diagonalisation of the two commuting variables of difference in position @xmath18 and total momentum @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are a standard pair of canonically conjugate variables with @xmath21=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "fan and klauder @xcite give an explicit form for the common eigenvectors of the relative position and total momentum for two epr particles in terms of creation operators as follows : @xmath22 is an arbitrary complex number , @xmath23=1 $ ] , @xmath24=1 $ ] and @xmath25 , the two - mode vacuum state .",
    "thus @xmath26 with the coordinate and momentum operators definable as : @xmath27    as a genuine representation of ideal generalised epr states , with appropriate orthonormality and completeness , @xmath28 is singular . in this paper",
    "we consider the following regularised version : @xmath29 .",
    "the bipartite cv state ( [ bieta ] ) is to be compared with a regularised epr - like state which has already appeared in the literature  the so - called nopa state from quantum optics @xcite-@xcite : @xmath30 operators , we can reorder the expression for nopa ( [ nopa ] ) into the following form : @xmath31 note from ( [ rearrangednopa ] ) that in the number basis , as @xmath32 the @xmath33 state approximates the ideal epr limit : @xmath34      a suitable analogue of equations ( [ bieta ] ) or ( [ rearrangednopa ] ) which has the features required of an entangled state , which we analyse in detail below , is defined by : @xmath39 .",
    "for the case @xmath40 , the tripartite epr - like state becomes : @xmath41 ) belong to the well known pure , fully symmetric three - mode gaussian states , the more general case of ( [ trieta ] ) where the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are retained is not symmetric , since the parameters can all differ .",
    "for discussion of gaussian states in relation to entanglement in cv systems , see @xcite and references therein .    whereas the bipartite state @xmath45 was a simultaneous eigenstate of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , in the tripartite case the choice of relative variables is no longer immediately apparent . in a similar manner to the derivation of ( [ bieta ] ) , it is readily established using manipulations of the type : @xmath48+\\frac 12 [ a,[a , a]]+\\ldots\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that generically @xmath49 is an eigenstate of the following combinations : @xmath50    from this it is clear that different values of @xmath51 will dictate limiting cases wherein @xmath49 becomes a singular eigenvalue of various choices of relative variables .",
    "( note that in the bipartite case we could have introduced @xmath36 as @xmath52 analogously , recovering ( [ bieta ] ) in the case @xmath53 . )",
    "keeping @xmath51 general , the eigenvalue equations become : @xmath54    from ( [ neweigen ] ) it is clear that the singular cases will occur for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "for the case @xmath55 we evidently have a singular eigenstate of the relative coordinates , while remaining a _ squeezed _ state @xcite of the total momentum .",
    "conversely , for @xmath56 we have a singular eigenstate of the total momentum , but a squeezed state of the relative coordinates .",
    "if we construct mode operators corresponding to the jacobi relative variables and the canonical centre - of - mass variables , say @xmath57 then we find , from ( [ neweigen ] ) for general @xmath51 : @xmath58 from which it is again obvious that for @xmath55 or @xmath56 , canonical combinations arise in the first two , and last cases respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - canonical combinations appearing for @xmath55 in the third , and @xmath56 in the first two cases , indicate that the squeezing parameters have the values @xmath59 in each instance .",
    "having established the structure of the tripartite epr - like states , we can examine their behaviour when applied to wigner functions , and the consequences of using these states in chsh inequalities .",
    "the wigner function @xcite , was an attempt to provide the schrdinger wavefunction with a probability in phase space .",
    "the time - independent function for one pair of @xmath60 and @xmath61 variables is : @xmath62    alternatively , it has been shown @xcite that a useful expression of the wigner function is in the form of quantum expectation values . for @xmath12 modes , the wigner function for a state @xmath63 may be expressed as the expectation value of the displaced parity operator , where the parity operator itself performs reflections about phase - space points ( @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , with @xmath66 denoting the mode , and : @xmath67 the displaced parity operator is : @xmath68 where @xmath69 are the number operators , and for each mode the glauber displacement operators are of the form : @xmath70    when we express the wigner function in the form of ( [ wigner ] ) , we can derive a set of these functions to construct the inequalities that will be discussed in section [ chshsect ] .",
    "the tripartite wigner function for @xmath49 becomes :    @xmath71    we evaluate such matrix elements by commuting mode operators with the parity operator and rearranging using bch identities before casting the operators into anti - normal ordered form .",
    "then a complete set of coherent states is inserted and integrated over . as indicated in section [ bipsub ] and shown in [ etaappendix ] , we can absorb the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 parameters by shifting the displacement parameters up to a factor : @xmath72 .",
    "we are free to choose instances where @xmath73 , and henceforth we assume @xmath74 unless otherwise stated , and write simply @xmath75 . with this shift in displacements ,",
    "the wigner function for our tripartite state becomes : @xmath76\\bigg)\\label{wigner2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77    the most important point to note here is the emergence of mixed conjugate / non - conjugate pairs , which do not appear in the wigner function for the second - quantised nopa - like optical analogue ( see [ a1 ] ) . to make the behaviour of the wigner function in the asymptotic region clearer ,",
    "the parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are written in polar form , @xmath81 etc .",
    "the wigner function thus becomes :    @xmath82\\bigg)\\label{polarwigner}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the chsh inequalities @xcite are cv generalisations of the original bell inequalities which were set up to test the scheme proposed by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) in 1935 @xcite . considering the measurement of an entangled pair of particles performed after they have been separated such that no classical communication channels are open when the wavefunction collapses , epr posited that either quantum mechanics must be incomplete , with room for a hidden variable theory , or spatiotemporal locality is violated .",
    "bell showed that hidden variables were not permitted if we preserve both the assumptions of accepted theory  specifically locality  and the probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics .",
    "generalised @xmath12-mode bell inequalities  chsh inequalities , in terms of the bell operator expectation values @xmath83  exist ( see for example @xcite ) . in their bi- and tripartite form",
    "we can apply these to our regularised epr - like states . following @xcite ,",

    "if we look in the region @xmath16 for ( [ bizeroeta ] ) , an all - imaginary substitution obviously gives exactly the same maximum violation as nopa with @xmath13 , both having a maximum value of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the figure shows clearly that the value of @xmath88 increases as @xmath16 and @xmath89 .    in the tripartite case",
    "however , we must examine the wealth of other possible choices which extremise the inequality . from the form of the wigner function in ( [ polarwigner ] ) , however , there are some clear choices that will minimise the last term in @xmath90 . choosing all the phases @xmath91 , and all the magnitudes @xmath92 , such that all the parameters are imaginary @xmath93 , equation ( [ polarwigner ] ) becomes : @xmath94 consequently @xmath90 is ( from ( [ b3 ] ) ) : @xmath95    in the region @xmath16 , @xmath90 never reaches a value greater than @xmath96 ( figure [ tripartite2 ] ) . a violation corresponding to the epr limit @xmath97",
    "can be found by making the choice @xmath98 ; @xmath99 , for which ( [ polarwigner ] ) gives : @xmath100 and @xmath90 becomes ( figure [ tripartite2.09 ] ) : @xmath101 as @xmath16 , @xmath89 , the maximum value is @xmath102 , which can be checked both analytically and numerically .",
    "however , what is more interesting still is exploring an auxiliary regime of the regulator , @xmath17 , in equation ( [ imb3 ] ) .",
    "this is shown in figure [ tripartite2.32 ] . analytically , we can approximate the maximum to the lowest order in @xmath103 by writing @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , with maximum @xmath107 at @xmath108 .",
    "this can be confirmed numerically for @xmath17 , @xmath89 .",
    "the values of @xmath109 correspond exactly to those calculated for the experimentally verified nopa - like states , whose maximisation as @xmath1 is also governed by ( [ b3max ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have analysed tripartite cv entangled states which are natural generalisations of the classic bipartite epr - type states ( for two systems with canonical variables @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) .",
    "given the necessity of working with normalisable states which still approximate the ideal epr - type limit for practical implementation of chsh inequalities , we examined a family of such regulated states parameterized by a regulating parameter @xmath51 .",
    "this family of states was compared with those relating to multipartite nopa - like states .",
    "the nopa states have been shown to manifest chsh violations , and have the advantage of being directly accessible by experiment via standard quantum optics protocols such as multiparametric heterodyne detection techniques and beam splitter operations . however , as an extension of a direct transcription of the epr paradox , this new family of regularised states provides an alternative , systematic description of the approach to the ideal epr states for relative variables .    by finding expressions for the eigenstates of the regularised tripartite cv epr - like states it became apparent that there are two regimes of the regularisation parameter",
    "in which these states become singular : in one case ( @xmath3 ) we have a singular eigenstate of the relative coordinates while remaining squeezed in the total momentum ; in the other , @xmath6 limit we have a singular eigenstate of the total momentum , but squeezed in the relative coordinates . in these two regimes we have explored chsh inequalities via wigner functions regarded as expectation values of displaced parity operators .",
    "violations of the tripartite chsh bound ( @xmath7 ) are established analytically and numerically , with @xmath8 in the canonical regime ( @xmath9 ) , as well as @xmath10 in the auxiliary regime ( @xmath11 ) .    related tripartite entangled states have recently been constructed by fan @xcite . although these states are also accessible by standard quantum optics techniques , they are not true generalisations of ` epr ' states . in this case , while they diagonalise one centre - of - mass variable ( for example , @xmath114 ) , they are _ coherent _ states @xcite of the remaining relative jacobi observables ( that is , they diagonalise their annihilation mode operators @xmath115 , @xmath116 in contrast to the @xmath6 limit of our epr - type tripartite states , which as stated above turn out to be _ squeezed _ states of these relative degrees of freedom ( eigenstates of a linear combination @xmath117 , @xmath118 in the relative mode operators , with the value @xmath59 for the squeezing parameter ) . in the case of the tripartite entangled states of @xcite ,",
    "no regularisation has been given .",
    "a construction of true multipartite ideal epr states has , however , been provided in @xcite , with a second - quantised form for the tripartite state ( [ fan3 ] ) , which may be compared with the form for the nopa - like state ( [ quantizednopa3 ] ) .",
    "although the wigner functions for the tripartite nopa - like states show peaks at zeroes of @xmath119 and @xmath120 for all distinct pairs @xmath121 @xcite , which does not appear to be consistent with simultaneous diagonalisation of commuting observables , it can be inferred from the agreement of ( [ fan3 ] ) and ( [ quantizednopa3 ] ) that indeed in the infinite squeezing limit , @xmath122 , and with relative parameters equal to zero , the nopa - like state does again tend to the ideal epr state .",
    "since the nopa - like states are constructed with a view to experimental realisability , and , in the bipartite case , to manufacture the specific properties of the wigner function , this new suggestion for a regularisation stemming from a direct transcription of the epr paradox in terms of the simultaneous diagonalisation of commuting observables could be seen as a more general or fundamental description .",
    "it also considers in more detail the specific instance of tripartite epr - type states , compared to the comprehensive @xcite which finds @xmath123-partite representations of entangled states through their gaussian - form completeness relation without exploring regularisations and wigner function properties . as",
    "the proposed epr - type regularised state produces a different wigner function from the nopa - type , with two singular limits , this paper s proposed regularisation may potentially suggest that alternative experimental ways to achieve the violations of the chsh inequalities are possible . for a review of gaussian states , and discussions of the realisability of entangled states",
    ", we refer to @xcite , and references therein",
    ". it will be worth investigating the full extent of the constraints placed on the choices of displacement parameters entailed by the shift in @xmath42 ( see [ etaappendix ] ) .",
    "the current discussion might also easily be extended to include a presentation of the alternative bipartite starting point of conjugate variable choice @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "@xcite discusses the canonical combinations for any number of modes , but in our case it is reasonable to assume that an @xmath12-partite generalisation would be of the form @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "we would also expect that these states would admit standard completeness relations in the singular cases .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented a rigorous extension of fan and klauder s general epr - like states to the regularised tripartite cv case for relative variables , and highlighted the connection to current quantum optics implementations .",
    "the chsh inequalities constructed with component wigner functions for this case show significant violation of the classical bound , and the different choices of regularisation parameter making the state singular illustrate an interesting new feature of the structure of generalised cv epr - like states .",
    "this research was partially supported by the commonwealth of australia through the international endeavour awards .",
    "we thank robert delbourgo for a careful reading of the manuscript , and the referees for their suggestions helping to improve the presentation of this work .",
    "in this appendix the tripartite nopa and @xmath127 wigner functions are derived for comparison .      applying two phase - free beamsplitters at specified angles acting on one momentum squeezed state and two position squeezed states of mode @xmath128 , @xmath96 and @xmath129 respectively , @xcite states that the tripartite nopa - like states can be derived from the following expression :    @xmath130 ( where @xmath131 ) with the baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) relation :    @xmath132\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\exp\\left[\\frac 12 ( e^{i\\theta}\\tanh r)a^{\\dagger 2}\\right ] \\exp\\left[-2(\\ln\\,\\cosh r)(\\frac 12 a^{\\dagger}a \\!+ \\!\\frac 14)\\right]\\exp \\left[-\\frac 12 ( e^{-i\\theta}\\tanh r)a^2\\right].\\label{bch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the following beamsplitter operation phase shift ) between the two modes has been omitted ;",
    "see for example @xcite ] can then be applied , where @xmath133 here refers to the angles @xmath134 and @xmath135 for the @xmath136 and @xmath137 splitters respectively : @xmath138 and normalising , the tripartite nopa is expressible in second - quantised form as : @xmath139    using this state to derive the wigner function of the form ( [ wigner ] ) , the complex exponential that is produced may be rearranged using the formula ( [ berezin ] ) .",
    "the tripartite nopa wigner function then becomes : @xmath140 this is the result quoted in @xcite , and further explication can be found in that paper .",
    "this function should be compared with the wigner function of our regularised tripartite epr - like state , @xmath49 .",
    "further details of that derivation are given below .",
    "in the interest of brevity , the conditions for shifting the @xmath42 parameters are shown below for the biparite case .",
    "however , the analysis extends in an obvious way to the triparite case .",
    "after bch and anti - normal ordering , the bipartite wigner function ( tripartite given in equation ( [ wignerstart ] ) ) becomes : @xmath142 we then make the generic substitutions @xmath143 into @xmath144 . to find the expressions for @xmath145 and @xmath146 that will allow us to set @xmath147 , we solve the following : @xmath148",
    "thus we can see that , if we allow the constraints @xmath149 ( i.e. @xmath150 real and @xmath42 imaginary or vice versa ) , then the expressions for @xmath145 and @xmath146 become @xmath151    therefore , up to a factor , taking @xmath147 corresponds to a shift in the parameters of the displacement operators @xmath152 , @xmath153 ( and @xmath154 in the tripartite case ) . for the tripartite wigner function as used in section ( [ wignersec ] ) , this can be expressed as : @xmath155      the second - quantised epr - like state is expressed as ( [ trieta ] ) .",
    "this is used to find the wigner function in the form of ( [ wignerstart ] ) .",
    "by commuting mode operators with the parity operator and rearranging using bch identities , the expression becomes , in anti - normal ordered form : @xmath156 in anti - normal ordered form we may insert a complete set of coherent states @xmath157 such that we may rearrange the exponential according to the formula @xcite : @xmath158 \\exp\\left(-\\frac 12 ( z , z^*)\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c } z\\\\z^ * \\end{array}\\right ) + ( \\mu , \\nu^*)\\left(\\begin{array}{c } z\\\\z^ * \\end{array}\\right)\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ = \\left[det\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}c & d \\\\ a & b \\end{array}\\right)\\right]^{-\\frac 12 } \\exp\\left[\\frac 12(\\mu,\\nu^*)\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{array}\\right)^{-1 } \\left(\\begin{array}{c } \\mu\\\\\\nu^ * \\end{array}\\right)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ = \\left[det\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}c & d \\\\ a & b \\end{array}\\right)\\right]^{-\\frac 12 } \\exp\\left[\\frac 12(\\mu,\\nu^*)\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}c & d \\\\ a & b \\end{array}\\right)^{-1 } \\left(\\begin{array}{c } \\nu^*\\\\\\mu \\end{array}\\right)\\right]\\label{berezin},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where matrices @xmath159 and @xmath160 must be symmetrical , and @xmath161 . in this instance @xmath162",

    "<S> whereas the multipartite entangled states of nopa type have singular wigner functions in the limit of large squeezing , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 ( approaching the epr states in the bipartite case ) , our regularised tripartite epr states show singular behaviour not only in the approach to the epr - type region ( @xmath3 in our notation ) , but also for an additional , auxiliary regime of the regulator ( @xmath4 ) . while the @xmath5 limit pertains to tripartite cv states with singular eigenstates of the relative coordinates and remaining squeezed in the total momentum , the @xmath6 limit yields singular eigenstates of the total momentum , but squeezed in the relative coordinates . </S>",
