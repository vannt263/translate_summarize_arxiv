    "one starts similarly calculating each single - junction sm .",
    "then , the iterative use of this combining recipe leads to the total sm .      in the case of cylindrical symmetry ,",
    "overlapping integrals get easier since can be reduced to one dimension .",
    "let us detail the expressions for the simple case of plane hard - wall confinement .",
    "the symmetry assures that will be no matching of modes belonging to different acimutal quantum numbers @xmath67@xcite , so we obtain a 2d equivalent problem for each @xmath67 . the number of 2d problems that one needs to solve increases with tubes width .",
    "let us consider a _",
    "cylindrical uniform _ waveguide section .",
    "electrons are confined with hard - walls at distance @xmath11 of axis @xmath68 , the confining potential @xmath69 is only function of the distance to this axis .",

    "this is : @xmath82 where : @xmath83 @xmath84 being @xmath85 the @xmath80 component of the wavevector for the subband @xmath86 .",
    "therefore given the ( infinite ) set of complex numbers @xmath87 and given the basis @xmath78 , we have completely described the wavefunction @xmath77 . for any other radius @xmath88",
    "the solution is , obviously , analogous .",
    "this formulation of the problem gives the correspondent sm for each @xmath67 quantum number .",
    "matrix equations are the same than in previous sections if we specify the change of basis matrix @xmath33 and the transverse wavevector diagonal matrix @xmath89 .",
    "so that for a single junction joining tubes of radius @xmath19 and @xmath34 , being @xmath34 lower than @xmath19 ( similar to that represented in fig . [",
    "fig1 ] ) we have : @xmath90 @xmath91 ^ 2 = 4 \\pi^2 e   - [ q_{ml}(r)]^2\\ ] ] being @xmath92 given by the transversal quantized levels .",
    "the calculation of the relevant integral , for the _ simple case of hard - wall boundary conditions ( @xmath93 constant inside the tubes ) _ , yields : @xmath94 } { [ \\alpha_{mh}/b]^2   - [ \\alpha_{mj}/a]^2 }   \\end{array}\\ ] ] in this case , radial wavefunctions are given by : @xmath95 being @xmath96 the zero number @xmath97 of @xmath98 , the bessel function of integer order @xmath67 , and @xmath85 the @xmath80 component of the wavevector given by : @xmath99 - [ \\alpha_{ml}/r]^2 } $ ] .      within this framework , one can easily evaluate the conductance of a two terminal system on the basis of landauer s scattering approach @xcite , which is given by the formula : @xmath100 where the sum runs to all propagant modes in the input lead ( propagant modes are defined as those with a correspondent real @xmath8 , while the rest -those with imaginary longitudinal wavevector @xmath8- are called evanescent ) . here",
    ", @xmath101 is the universal spinless quantum of conductance with the value @xmath102 .",
    "the transmission probability for incidence through mode @xmath103 can be easily obtained and is given by : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the @xmath106 element of the @xmath107 matrix given in equation [ eq25c ] , the sum runs to all propagant modes of the final lead , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the @xmath21 and @xmath103 longitudinal wavevectors of the final and initial tubes respectively .",
    "one crucial point in the correct calculation of the sm of a quantum waveguide junction is the right truncation of two infinite series of modes representing wave functions at both sides of the junction .    in the analysis of junctions ,",
    "different converged results may be obtained for different ratios of the number of modes retained on each side .",
    "this convergence problem is usually referred to as relative convergence phenomenon @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have found that the correct converged result is obtained if the ratio of modes on each side is taken the same as the ratio of the corresponding waveguide widths @xcite .",
    "further calculations give another optimum value for this ratio which is 1.5 times the ratio of waveguide widths @xcite .    in our analysis",
    "we have found that one can generalize this optimal ratio criterium to an optimal `` procedure '' which gives different ratios in different cases .",
    "our approach is based on observations of the coupling between different modes at waveguide junctions .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the 2d axial symmetric hard - wall problem of a single junction like the one shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . assuming incidence from left to right and for a fixed incident mode @xmath103 ,",
    "the plot of the coupling integral @xmath110 versus `` wide '' transversal modes , @xmath21 , is `` peaked '' at @xmath111 such that its transverse wave vector satisfies @xmath112 .",
    "thick dots in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] represent values of this overlaping integral , the peak can be clearly seen at @xmath112 ( in this simple case @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) . in a `` mean field approximation ''",
    "@xcite true overlaps are approximated by a uniform coupling to all modes within one level spacing , represented by the dashed line in fig .",
    "this approximation gives excellent total transmission results when the difference in widths is big @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that exists a given band of modes of the wide side effectively coupled to the @xmath103-th mode of the narrow side .",
    "one needs to take into account all modes in this continuous interval to assure a correct representation of the `` narrow '' mode @xmath103 in the `` wide '' basis of transversal eigenfunctions .",
    "the truncation recipe that we have found is based on this observation .    though we have shown here a simple case , this mode matching scheme holds for different confining potentials and presumably for all of them ( in particular we have checked some axial symmetric potentials in 2d and 3d : hard - wall , soft wall and harmonic .",
    "also some non symmetric 2d and 3d potentials have been checked : hard - wall and soft - wall ) consequently , for one single junction similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the truncation procedure is as follows .",
    "given transversal levels sorted in crescent energy : ( i ) take one arbitrary number of modes @xmath115 in the narrow side , greater or equal than the number of propagant ones .",
    "this implies that @xmath115 can be written as @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the number of propagant modes and @xmath118 is the number of evanescent modes in the narrow tube .",
    "( ii ) take all modes of the wide side which are effectively connected to the ones chosen in the narrow side .",
    "this implies that we should use every wide - mode whose energy lies bellow @xmath119 given by @xmath120 .",
    "in other words , @xmath119 is the energy correspondent to the @xmath121 level of the narrow side .    for the truncation in the case of a greater system , in which the number of junctions is larger",
    ", the procedure is the same but choosing the narrowest of the whole system ( i.e. , the one that has the sparser transversal energy levels ) as the tube to define the threshold transversal energy @xmath119 .",
    "this @xmath119 value is then used to fix the number of modes retained at the rest of the uniform waveguide sections of the system .    using this procedure ,",
    "the number of evanescent modes taken in the narrowest tube @xmath118 is the only free parameter , it can be tuned for proper convergence of the results . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we can see the convergence of the conductance versus @xmath118 ( note that the number of evanescent modes taken into account in the wide side could be quite larger than @xmath118 ) .",
    "the plot has been done for the 3d `` hard - wall '' problem and is quite representative of the general behaviour for different confining potentials .",
    "the problem converges for @xmath118 equal four with an error of @xmath122 .",
    "the crucial point is that this way of making the truncation ensures good coupling of every mode at the narrow side , and the appropriate description of these modes is the main influence in conductance values .",
    "it is worth to notice here that matrices involved are rectangular in general .",
    "algebraical operations done assure the appropriate use of them : no numerical inversion of non - squared matrices has been done .",
    "one good property of this particular way of treating matrices involved is that flux is conserved with any truncation chosen ; this implies that @xmath123 even for @xmath124 ( where @xmath125 is the total transmission and @xmath126 is the total reflection for one particular propagant mode @xmath103 in the initial lead ) .    by the use of the matrix algebra proposed here",
    ", numerical unitarity and stability are achieved with ease .",
    "the sm formalism used , in which information from both ends of the system is taken in each step , avoids numerical roundoff errors accumulation in particular when combined with a suitable change of transversal basis as a function of the local width of the system .",
    "the truncation procedure explained above is the key for the achievement of these characteristics : it produces a self filtering of numerically unstable components without further data manipulation , hence the unitarity ( to compare with recursion - transfer - matrix methods see for instance ref .",
    "for several years now and in various experimental ways , the formation of ultrathin wires between two macroscopic pieces of metal has been routinely achieved and characterized @xcite .",
    "however , direct information about the atomic structure of these wires has not been available until recently when various experiments have achieved atomic resolution tem images on gold nanowires @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting features seen is the almost ideal perfect geometry , as well as surprising helical structures@xcite . to the date , theoretical",
    "work has been focused on the study of the stability and electronic structure for the thinnest monoatomic chains @xcite ; while for the helical wires works have been focused esentially in the prediction of the very structure for various metals @xcite , and the influence of helicity in the ideal ballistic conductance @xcite . in the second part of this work",
    "-by making use of the calculation method we have just described above- we approach this problem .",
    "we will point out some remarkable effects in the current and conductance patterns due to the ideal _ sharp _ geometries observed , these effects are valid in the presence or not of helicity .",
    "for a study on the effects of global _ smooth _ shapes in the conductance of atomic - scale 3d contacts see ref .",
    "@xcite .      a narrow - wide connection is eventually formed when an unsupported gold nanowire is done by experimental means@xcite .",
    "this can be modelled by a simple single junction connection in a 3d wire similar to that sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig8b ] .",
    "previous theoretical work on 2d nanowires have pointed out the existence of a vortex structure , for the quantum current density , as a result of a narrow - wide connection .",
    "interestingly , a change of pattern from laminar to `` turbulent '' flux is obtained for ballistic 2d free - electron calculations @xcite . in the analogous simplest case for 3d wires we observe a similar behaviour and transition , the onset of vortex structure formation is intimately linked to the income of the second transversal level in the wider part .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8b ] and [ fig9 ] we can see the charge and the current density for this 3d narrow - wide structure .",
    "the width of the narrow wire allows just a single propagating channel while the wide part allows two channels , this is the minimum required to exhibit the vortex structure that is remarked in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . periodic charge and current density structures are formed along the final wider tube , this can be readily explained in terms of constructive and destructive interference patterns for the only two channels occupied in the wide lead .",
    "there are points with charge density zero regularly distributed at both sides of the charge density maximums in fig .",
    "[ fig8b ] , these points are vortex centers in the quantum current map of fig .",
    "note that , due to the axial symmetry , these vortex points define rings in real space , and the flux sourrounding them torus surfaces .",
    "when the wide lead gets much wider , many transversal levels come up and the charge density structure gets irregular as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9b ] . the same explanation remains valid this time : the pattern results from the interference of many -in this case- longitudinal wavelenghts , the period of these patterns increases with the number of levels involved , eventually it gets seemingly non periodic as the case seen in fig . [ fig9b ] where no regular pattern is observed",
    ".    these results could be important for the understanding -and therefore control- of coherent waves by tuning geometrical parameters .",
    "in particular the transition from a regular one dimensional lattice of maximums to a disordered pattern by changing the width of the outgoing waveguide could be amenable of experimental verification ( may be with electromagnetic waves rather than electrons ) .",
    "a single junction , as the one seen in previous section , can be regarded as a scattering center in general terms .",
    "realistic wires have atomic structure and therefore many possible scattering centers for the conduction electrons passing through .",
    "the inclusion of increasing number of scattering centers gives rise -as we will see- to a richer phenomenology . in this subsection",
    "we will focus in the case of just two scattering centers : a wide - narrow - wide ( wnw ) junction .",
    "two ( strong ) scattering centers suffice to predict negative differential resistance in point contact experiments .",
    "the ballistic conductance of a wnw structure , as the one in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , presents a dense resonant behaviour @xcite as a function of the narrow area and lenght as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "being this a very simplistic model , it is a fair representation of what can be expected when we have these main ingredients : @xmath127 a couple of strong scattering centers at a given distance , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 transversal confinement ( characterized by the area @xmath19 ) . in these cases we can expect a `` wavy landscape '' for the conductance as a function of ( @xmath128 , @xmath19 ) , though may be not the same than the one in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "clearly , however , the variation of any of these relevant parameters can eventually give any derivative .",
    "this diversity of results is what -we will see- is possible for the case of monoatomic contacts .    within this very simple wnw representation of atomic size contacts",
    ", we can easily locate the zone in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] that reasonably belongs to monoatomic ( or very few atoms ) contacts for typical metals .",
    "this zone is what we have represented in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , on it we have labeled three different points belonging to 3 different possible particular geometries or ideal contacts .",
    "arrows indicate the evolution due to an eventual stretching process of these few - atoms contacts . before breaking , seems reasonable to think that the effective lenght will increase and effective area will slightly decrease @xcite , this is what the arrows indicate .",
    "now , as can be seen , as a function of the starting spot , the subsequent evolution of the conductance can be very different .",
    "if we are initially located in point 1 , the evolution will be mostly quantized ( values very near @xmath101 ) and essentially horizontal ; the probability of this event to happen is quite high due to the great number of points in the plane ( @xmath128 , @xmath19 ) belonging to this type .",
    "however , there is a good chance of falling in a place like the one labeled 3 , in this case -as the arrow indicates- we expect to observe a decreasing of @xmath130 before breaking the contact .",
    "finally , there is a little but non negligible chance for our starting point to be like the labeled 2 ; in this case , since we are located in the minimum of the `` valley '' , further stretching will make an increase in the conductance as indicated .",
    "the behaviour for case 2 is the more surprising since it predicts increasing of conductance while stretching the wire .",
    "should this model be valid , it could be expected to be found for given geometries and/or metals .",
    "in fact there is compelling experimental evidence of negative differential resistance for the case of aluminum@xcite , and theoretical explanation in terms of atomistic density functional calculations @xcite for the case of relatively wide cross - section wires .",
    "our present free - electron result provides a helpful simple view of good part of the relevant physics in these systems , a complementary piece of the whole picture , especially relevant for the few - atoms - contact case .",
    "long physical wires have their thinnest expression in what we can call monoatomic ( in width ) long wires .",
    "the existence of -relatively long- monoatomic gold wires has been experimentally reported @xcite and theoretically studied @xcite very recently . in a chain like this ,",
    "each atom is a system on its own that holds localized electronic states in addition to those extended states responsible for conduction .",
    "very simple modelling of this can be done by the repitition of a wnw structure .",
    "as we will see , this periodic repetition gives rise to a long chain of 3d `` resonance boxes '' . with the selection of proper dimensions for the geometrical parameters of these boxes",
    ", localized states can be contained inside .",
    "the correspondent energy levels of this states can be an open door for _ resonant tunneling _ phenomena in these 3d structures .",
    "this is proved here for a sufficiently long periodic wire .    for a clear exhibition of resonant tunneling phenomena in 3d structures",
    "let us start with the standard wnw problem as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath130 versus incident energy yields the expected quantized steps with resonance oscilations overimposed .",
    "there is a threshold energy at @xmath131 marking the onset of the first propagating level in the narrow tube , which is seen as the first jump in conductance .",
    "now , if we mantain the same geometry but we add -in the central narrow tube- a wider box as shown in the inset , we can clearly appreciate the appearance of a resonant tunneling peak quite before this threshold energy .",
    "this is completely analogous to the obtained in 1d and 2d models .",
    "it can be clearly prooved that perfect transparence is achieved at the resonant tunneling energy .",
    "not only the value of transmission gets to 1 at a given e , but the periodic repetition of this structure does not filter down conductivity but simply increases the number of peaks . there is a new peak for each 3d quantum resonant box we add : a splitting effect between degenerate localized levels is proved as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] . in this figure",
    ", a zoom of the resonant peak is seen for the cases of 1 , 2 and 28 resonant boxes .",
    "perfect transmission peaks are not the only consequence of interference , total reflection is also obtained as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] .",
    "a `` band like '' structure appears as a consequence of the periodicity imposed in the chain of 28 boxes .",
    "there are intervals of energy where transmission is nearly one and intervals where it is practically zero , this is in connection with conduction bands and energy gaps of simple one dimensional band theories @xcite .",
    "the complete inhibition of transmission is not obtained in pure 1d problems while for 2d and 3d problems total reflection is naturally achieved@xcite .",
    "we have developed a formulation of the scattering matrix method to solve general three dimensional waveguide problems .",
    "the truncation method , based on the way the mode coupling is done , provides quick convergence of results with one single parameter to be tuned : the number of evanescent modes in the narrowmost part of the system .",
    "the method has been already successfully used for the calculation in optical waveguides @xcite and electronic ballistic contacts@xcite .",
    "examples of convergence tests and calculations have been also shown .",
    "in particular , we have studied with some detail the problem of quantum conductance in metallic nanowires .",
    "various simple models of crescent number of junctions have been studied . for narrow - wide connections charge density and quantum current patterns",
    "have been shown , interestingly vortex rings are obtained for this simple geometry in analogy to previous 2d calculations . this vortex structure starts forming a regular pattern and becomes apparently disordered with increasing tubes width .",
    "the calculation for wide - narrow - wide connections gives rise to strong resonant behaviour of the conductance as a function of width and length of the contact .",
    "due to the very recent appearance of experiments in which impressively straight nanowires have been imaged , seems pertinent a closer look at this idealized geometry model . therefore , interpretation of wnw results , leads to the prediction of several behaviours of the conductance in the last plateaus of an experimental breaking proccess ; in particular negative differential resistance can be expected .",
    "further addition of junctions to form periodic wnw structures gives rise to resonant tunneling effects in what we can think of as a simple model for a long periodic nanowire .",
    "opossite to 1d models and analogous to 2d , not only perfect transmission is obtained for the resonant tunneling energy but perfect reflection appears for some finite intervals of energy .",

    "<S> an easy to implement and powerful method for the solution of 3d scattering problems that can be well described by helmholtz equation is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix algebra used provides excellent stability versus the number of junctions as well as great computational speed . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix truncation method yields an easy single - parameter convergence procedure . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , some aspects of the electronic transport through metal nanowires are studied by the use of landauer s scattering approach to the conductance . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the existence of current vortex - rings patterns due to sharp enough narrow - wide connections in atomic size point contacts . </S>",
    "<S> longitudinal resonances between scattering centers provide a simple physical picture for the understanding of negative differential resistance in ideal monoatomic contacts . </S>",
    "<S> relatively long nanowires with high geometrical perfection -like those recently observed by transmission electron microscopy- are modelled exhibiting resonant tunnelling and total reflection at given incident energy intervals . </S>",
    "<S> +    2    future daily - life technology will be greatly based on miniaturization of both electronic components and optical devices . </S>",
    "<S> state - of - the - art research has already prototyped tools using simultaneously both electrons and photons confinement . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in artificially created electromagnetic micro - cavities interaction light - matter can best be described by new concepts like those of `` cavity polaritons''@xcite , devices in which the light emission process can be extra - ordinarily fast . </S>",
    "<S> also , quantum well lasers utilizing two - dimensional electron gas and optical modulators with quantum confinement effect are now practically used . </S>",
    "<S> the ultimate integration of any opto - electronic device has to overcome the theoretical and practical problem of the waveguiding at tiny sizes for both electrons and photons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , it is not surprising the huge research effort devoted , in the last decade , to these waveguides themselves : _ metallic wires at the nanometer scale _ and _ optical waveguides at the micrometer scale_. a common characteristic lays on the basis of these waveguide systems : elastic scattering processes are dominant for transport . </S>",
    "<S> metallic atomic - size wires and micro - optical guides present lateral dimensions of the order of the wavelength associated to the particles passing through . </S>",
    "<S> helmholtz equation governs elastic flux of waves through a general dispersive system ( note here that the independent free - electron stationary schrdinger equation is equivalent ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ability to calculate solutions for this equation is of great importance .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the experimental and theoretical study of metallic nanowires , namely their electrical and structural properties , has been focus of intense research in the last decade ( see e.g articles in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as well as the various experimental works of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and the theoretical works in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , only very recently , the combination of scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) with transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) has achieved atomic - resolution images of metallic nanowires@xcite . in particular , ultrathin gold wires have been observed exhibiting a striking geometrical regularity in some cases . here </S>",
    "<S> we intend to look at some possible effects due to the ideal geometry of these nanowires . due to the simple -therefore general- phenomenology studied , </S>",
    "<S> the same physics is expected to be found by more sophisticated approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : first we present a generalized scattering matrix method for the solution of helmholtz ( or schrdinger ) equation in section [ secsm ] . though the formalism developed can be applied to general scalar wave propagation problems and even scattering of light in some cases , we use it later to address the problem of conduction through atomic - size contacts : in section [ secwires ] we focus on the study of electronic conduction through metallic nanowires with several models . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in section [ secconcl ] we summarize our results . </S>"
