    "the study of mott insulating states of spin-1/2 systems has a long history in condensed matter physics .",
    "the main motivation of these studies lies in their relation to high-@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "solid state systems are seldom clean , usually lattice defects , vibrations , or simply the complicated nature of the compound obscure the main effects that theoretical models try to grasp .",
    "ultracold atoms on optical lattices seems to provide a nice alternative to study mott insulators and quantum magnetism , since the optical lattice is free of any defects and there is a great liberty in choosing or even tuning the geometry of the lattice even in situ . in the last decade",
    "mott states of bosonic @xcite as well as fermionic @xcite atoms has been reached experimentally , however , it still remains a challenge to reach quantum magnetism and detect magnetic correlations .",
    "the main reason behind the difficulties is the limitation on cooling , since with present experimental methods it is hard to access the temperatures at the scale of the magnetic superexchange , i.e. in the range of few nano kelvins ( for recent progress see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , a series of nice experiments were developed to catch quantum @xcite or even classical @xcite magnetism .",
    "one possibility is the realization of effective models that can be easier to cool down to sufficiently low temperature . in ref .",
    "@xcite tilted hubbard model was used to mimic an ising chain , where the empty and double occupied sites represent the spin up and down states , respectively .",
    "another possibility opens by tuning the tunneling amplitude between the neighboring lattice sites to create a staggered - dimerized lattice or a quasi - one - dimensional lattice @xcite . in these cases",
    "the energy scale of the stronger bonds are tuned above the temperature of the cloud , while along the weak bonds the energy is well bellow of it . with this arrangement",
    "the system preserves some features of the lower temperature state and can show weak magnetic order .",
    "high spin mott insulating states also have been realized experimentally with ytterbium isotopes @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "ytterbium just as alkaline - earth atoms have 2 electrons on the outer @xmath1-shell , therefore their total electronic angular momentum is zero , and the total hyperfine spin of the atom comes only from the nuclear spin .",
    "these atoms interact essentially via @xmath1-wave scattering independent of the nuclear spin . as a consequence of the spin independent interaction , alkaline - earth metal systems  or atoms with equivalent electron shell structure  can be described with good accuracy even by extremely high su(n ) symmetric models , where n@xmath2 is given by the nuclear spin @xmath3 of the atom . comparing with the usual two - component electron systems",
    ", high spin fermionic systems can show novel magnetic behavior @xcite . in the strong atom - atom interaction limit they can provide different multipole orders @xcite , valence bond solid ( vbs ) states , spin liquid ( sl ) states @xcite , or even chiral spin liquid ( csl ) states with non - trivial topology @xcite .",
    "the su(4 ) symmetric spin-3/2 system as the simplest case after the usual spin-1/2 electrons , has been studied intensively in the last few years @xcite , mostly on square lattice . on mean - field level",
    "the ground state is a vbs state with disconnected resonating valence bond plaquettes , but different numerical results for small systems raises the possibility of a bond - antiferromagnetic columnar dimer state @xcite . on a honeycomb lattice",
    "it was found that the pure su(4 ) heisenberg system realizes a spin - orbital liquid phase @xcite , while the addition of next nearest neighbor exchange induces collapse to a tetramerized vbs like state @xcite .",
    "the physics of the su(6 ) symmetric spin-5/2 system seems to be even more interesting , as its mean - field ground state is a csl on a square @xcite and also on a hexagonal lattice @xcite .",
    "the csl state violates time reversal symmetry and is topologically nontrivial and supports chiral edge states on the boundary of the lattice .",
    "the low - energy dynamics is described by 6-flavor spinons ( as matter fields ) interacting with a u(1 ) gauge field emerging from the antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the arising u(1 ) gauge theory is a dynamical chern - simons field theory where the gauge field dynamics is generated by the short distance physics of the underlying fermions @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a two - dimensional gas of spin-5/2 alkaline - earth atoms on optical lattices provides a possibility to access experimentally u(1 ) gauge field dynamics as well as the corresponding non - trivial topological states .",
    "this way an alternative quantum simulator of gauge theories can be achieved , which complements other proposals with ultracold atoms @xcite .    in our previous work",
    "the csl state on a hexagonal lattice has been found to be competing with various vbs states with energies very close ( 1.5% ) to that of the chiral spin liquid ground state @xcite .",
    "considering the very small difference between the energies of the low lying states , a stability analysis of these low - energy states is needed to support or even deny their existence . according to the fact , that experiments are always done at finite temperature , it is also important to see the behavior of the zero temperature mean - field solutions at finite temperatures in order to determine the critical temperatures of the different sl and vbs states , and to see whether the lowest free - energy state changes to another one as the temperature is increased .",
    "finite temperature calculation was made for a similar system in ref .",
    "@xcite in the high temperature regime , and they managed to describe the metal - insulator transition , but still left open the finite temperature physics far in the mott insulator regime , where quantum magnetism characterizes the system .",
    "in this paper we address these problems by considering spin-5/2 alkaline - earth atoms loaded into a two - dimensional hexagonal lattice . supposing a strong on - site repulsive interaction and a filling of one particle per site , the system is described by an effective nearest - neighbor model of su(6 ) spin exchange .",
    "hermele , gurarie and rey argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that a classical nel - like ground state is unfavorable for su(n ) systems for @xmath4 .",
    "therefore we assume that the state is not classically ordered but rather one with a conserved su(6 ) symmetry .",
    "we analyze the stability and the finite temperature properties of the three lowest lying states within the path integral formalism , which is a reformulation of the gutzwiller projected variational mean - field theory .",
    "we show that the chiral sl state and one of the higher energy vbs states are stable against the displacement from the saddle point , while the staggered - like vbs state occurs to be unstable .",
    "the finite temperature analysis shows that by increasing the temperature all three states vanish at the same critical temperature giving way to the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the free energy functions never cross each other , the chiral sl state characterizes the system even at finite temperatures , however , in the vicinity of the critical temperature the free energies practically coincide . from experimental aspects",
    "it is also important to provide information about the measurable quantities .",
    "accordingly we determine the magnetic structure factor of the three lowest lying states and argue that these states can be distinguished by their fingerprints on the structure factor .",
    "we also determine the spectral function of the spin correlator and show how the spectrum of elementary excitations differ for the discussed phases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pathint ] the model and the path integral formulation of the problem is introduced . with the help of a hubbard - stratonovich transformation we introduce slowly varying bosonic fields characterizing the vbs and sl phases .",
    "we integrate out the fermion degrees of freedom and arrive to a non - polynomial effective action of the hubbard - stratonovich fields . in sec .",
    "[ sec : meanfield ] we apply the saddle - point expansion which to leading order gives the mean - field solutions of the problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stability ] the next - to - leading order correction is calculated for the effective action in order to study the stability of the saddle - point solutions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : structfact ] the spin - spin correlation function and its spectral function are calculated and compared for the different saddle - point solutions .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is the summary .",
    "some calculations are moved to the appendix .",
    "we consider a system of ultracold spin-5/2 @xmath5 atoms on an optical lattice with hexagonal structure . for a single yb atom",
    "the angular momentum of the electrons is zero since the outer shell is an @xmath1-shell with two opposite spin electrons .",
    "therefore the total spin of an yb atom is given by its nuclear spin alone and as a consequence atomic collisions become spin independent . at low temperatures and when the optical lattice is sufficiently deep the atoms occupy the lowest bands of the individual sites and the system can be described by a hubbard model generalized to 6 components . @xmath6 where the first sum is over nearest neighbor pairs while the second sum runs through the sites of the whole lattice .",
    "the operator @xmath7 creates a fermion at site @xmath8 with spin component @xmath9 , and @xmath10 represents the hopping amplitude . in the second term @xmath11 denotes the occupation number of site @xmath8 , and @xmath12 is the strength of the repulsive , su(6 ) symmetric on - site interaction .",
    "we consider the case of 1/6 filling , where the number of lattice sites is equal to the number of atoms .",
    "we also assume strong on - site interaction , @xmath13 .",
    "this limit can be already achieved in standard tight optical lattices , as recently demonstrated by the lens group @xcite , where the tonks parameter @xmath14 in the 1-dimensional ytterbium gas was reached , indicating a strongly correlated regime .",
    "another idea is to use supertight lattices employing nanotechnology , as proposed in ref .",
    "this limit can in principle also be realized in experiments with feshbach or optical feshbach resonances @xcite , although this method is experimentally very challenging .    in the exact limit of @xmath15 , the hopping term vanishes from eq . and",
    "the lattice gas becomes completely static , with a highly degenerate ground state , which is a mott insulator state with exactly one particle at every site . at low temperatures and for @xmath16 , but finite , one can use perturbation theory in @xmath17 up to second order to resolve the degeneracy and to arrive to an effective spin exchange hamiltonian ( similarly as in the case of the standard fermi - hubbard model @xcite ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "this effective hamiltonian describes processes conserving the unit population at every site and only allows the exchange of spins between nearest neighbor sites .",
    "one can considered this model as a generalization of the su(2 ) heisenberg model to su(6 ) spins , since the hamiltonian can also be expressed as @xmath20 , where the `` artificial '' su(6 ) spin operators are given by @xmath21 these su(6 ) generators are not to be confused with the 6 dimensional representation of the original atomic spin operators .",
    "the @xmath22 spin operators at every site , given by eq .",
    ", span the su(6 ) lie algebra , i.e. operators on the same lattice site satisfy the commutator @xmath23=s_{i,\\gamma\\beta}\\,\\delta_{\\alpha\\delta}-s_{i,\\alpha\\delta}\\,\\delta_{\\gamma\\beta},\\ ] ] while operators on different lattice sites commute with each other . according to the one particle per site constraint , the operator sum @xmath24 .",
    "it means that this sum of the su(6 ) spin operators commutes with all other su(6 ) operators , therefore the number of independent generators is actually @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , it means that the dimension of the local hilbert space at site @xmath8 is 6 , and thus we work with the fundamental representation of su(6 ) .",
    "one should stress , however , that in the following we do not make use of the description in terms of local spins , allowing instead for fermi pairings on the links , similarly as in the case of slave - boson theories @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian has local u(1 ) gauge invariance , namely it is invariant under the following local gauge transformation    [ fermion_sym_sinkovicz ] @xmath26    with the arbitrary position and time dependent real parameters @xmath27 .",
    "we discuss finite temperature properties of the system .",
    "the key quantity is the canonical partition function at inverse temperature @xmath28 which is evaluated in the imaginary time path - integral formalism @xcite @xmath29 e^{-s[\\overline{c},c ] } \\prod_{i,\\tau } \\delta\\left(\\sum_\\alpha\\overline{c}_{i \\alpha}c_{i \\alpha } - 1\\right).\\ ] ] the delta functions in the integrand assure the one - particle constraint at every site and for every imaginary time @xmath30 .",

    "according to the pioneering works by marston and affleck on the general su(n ) hubbard models @xcite and the more recent analysis of hermele , gurarie and rey on su(n ) symmetric models realized with ultracold atoms @xcite we consider only spin liquid states , i.e. where the global su(6 ) symmetry is not broken . in this case , with the help of a hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation @xcite , new , slowly varying fields are introduced .",

    "the fermion action is quadratic , and one can think about the system as noninteracting fermions hopping on the sites of the hexagonal lattice immersed into a scalar potential @xmath39 and vector potential @xmath46 .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the appearing gauge fields are not static : there is functional integration over all the possible @xmath44 and @xmath45 configurations .",
    "indeed , the integration over the gauge degrees of freedom is the essence of the path - integral formulation of the problem as it renders the expectation values of all non gauge invariant quantities to zero . this way the mean value of those operators which violate the one particle per site constraint are annulled @xcite .      in order to use momentum space representation on the honeycomb lattice one needs to introduce a nontrivial unit cell .",
    "the simplest choice is to use two sublattices , which is the case used in graphene , or generally in systems with two component fermions on hexagonal lattices . in our six component fermion case ,",

    "the temperature dependence of @xmath160 together with a sketch of the elementary fluxes is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfsols ] a ) .",
    "this shows that the chiral spin liquid state is robust at finite temperature , too , up to a critical temperature which is in the order of the exchange energy @xmath161 .",
    "the next phase , a bit higher in free energy , is the _ quasi plaquette _ or _",

    "@xcite ( or @xcite for the su(3 ) system ) . in this phase",

    "the flux of the central plaquette is @xmath157 , while the flux of the neighboring plaquettes is @xmath158 .",
    "this phase is three times degenerate due to the choice of the central plaquette , which can be any of the three independent elementary plaquettes , i.e. the hexagon of the unit cell , or one of its two independent neighbors .",
    "this state is time reversal symmetric , but violates the translation symmetry by one hexagon .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnitude of the bigger hs field , say @xmath160 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfsols ] b ) together with an illustration of the arrangement of the fluxes .",
    "the third phase we have considered is the _ plaquette phase _ @xcite .",
    "the hs fields in this phase have unit magnitude inside a central plaquette @xmath164 , with a wilson loop @xmath165 , and the others are zero @xmath166 .",
    "consequently , @xmath167 .",
    "this phase is also three times degenerate and violates lattice translation by one plaquette but is invariant under time reversal .",
    "this phase can also be characterized by the @xmath160 as order parameter , whose temperature dependence is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : mfsols ] . in this figure",
    "the configuration of the plaquette phase is also depicted .",
    "the results at zero temperature coincide completely with those found in @xcite .",
    "the interesting thing is that even at finite temperatures these three states remain to be the three lowest free energy saddle - point solutions .",
    "for these three lowest lying phases the temperature dependence of the free energy per plaquette is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : freeenerg ] .",
    "we have found that the free energy of the chiral spin liquid state remains slightly below the two other states , however , close to the critical point the free energy curves approach each other with high accuracy .",
    "this is in agreement with the behavior of the order parameters .",
    "when the temperature is increased the order parameters , the saddle - point values of the hs fields , get smaller and smaller and eventually vanish at a common critical temperature @xmath168 .",
    "the order parameters vanish with an exponent of @xmath169 , characteristic to the mean - field approximation . above this temperature",
    "the paramagnetic mott phase is stable , and close to @xmath0 a ginzburg - landau type analysis , based on this saddle - point expansion , describes the critical behavior .     of the three",
    "lowest lying saddle - point solutions . ]",
    "in the framework of the saddle - point approximation the stationary values of the fields are calculated with condition . therefore the effective action eq .",
    "has no first order contribution in the fluctuations . in order to go beyond the saddle - point approximation we consider the leading correction , which is the second order one in the fluctuations .",
    "thus the functional integral becomes a gaussian integral , with @xmath170 .",
    "the last two terms , which are quadratic in the fluctuations can be arranged to a convenient matrix form    [ eqs : curvature ] @xmath171 the @xmath172 kernel is the so called hessian and provides the curvature of the effective action : @xmath173    the hessian is a @xmath174 matrix , and depends on the saddle - point values of the fields @xmath175 .",
    "the derivation and explicit form of @xmath176 is given in appendix [ appendix ] .    throughout the paper",
    "we have assumed that the weight function @xmath177 in the path integral around the saddle - point configurations takes gaussian form . in this case",
    "the path integral can be evaluated and the partition function is the sum of the gaussian contributions of the different saddle - points . the first step to test the validity of a specific phase is to check whether the hessian @xmath178 is positive definite at the related configuration @xcite .",
    "if @xmath178 is positive definite , the weight function in the path integral drops when we move a bit farther from the saddle point , so the saddle - point solution is stable .",
    "the curvature is complex for nonzero matsubara frequencies , but the sum of the contributions of the @xmath179 pairs always provides a non - negative curvature , since @xmath180 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to check the stability of the phases for @xmath181 only .",
    "a minor difficulty still remains .",
    "namely , the scalar potential , introduced in eq .",
    "has to be purely imaginary for the representation of the dirac delta functions .",
    "however , the saddle - point equations provide real solutions for @xmath182 .",
    "such solutions are physical , and one can interpret the homogeneous and real @xmath183 as the chemical potential of the system . consequently the functional integral representation has to be understood after an analytical continuation @xmath184 .",
    "hence in the hessian the curvature is changed from positive to negative along the 6 directions of the scalar potential . the easiest way to treat",
    "the problem is to perform the gaussian integral over @xmath185 , as was done e.g. in ref @xcite to arrive to an effective action only for the @xmath97 fields , @xmath186 with @xmath187 a vector of 18 elements , obtained from @xmath188 by simply dropping the last 6 entries .",
    "@xmath189 is a @xmath190 matrix whose elements are formed from the matrix @xmath178 .",
    "its final form is also given in appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "now we reduced the stability problem to the eigenvalue analysis of the @xmath191 matrix : if all the 18 eigenvalues of @xmath191 for each @xmath82 ( i.e. in the whole brillouin zone ) are positive , @xmath191 is positive definite , the path integral remains gaussian , so the saddle - point approximation is reliable .",
    "we have determined the spectrum of @xmath191 for each of the three low lying states at low temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvals ] we plot the lowest nonzero eigenvalues for the stability matrix @xmath192 in the brillouin zone for the chiral spin liquid phase a ) , and for the quasi plaquette phase b ) .",
    "the chiral spin liquid phase is stable against perturbations , as the lowest nonzero eigenvalue is positive everywhere .",
    "contrary , the lowest nonzero eigenvalue of the curvature of effective action in case of the quasi plaquette phase develops prominent negative values around the @xmath193 point .",
    "this phase turns out to be unstable .",
    "note that among the 18 eigenvalues ( for every @xmath82 ) of the stability matrix @xmath192 we have some flat zero modes corresponding to the local gauge symmetry .",
    "both the chiral spin liquid and quasi plaquette phases have 6 such flat bands , since 6 of the link variables can be chosen real with the help of gauge fixing .    in the plaquette phase",
    "all eigenvalues are flat , because the lattice is formed by the completely disjoint plaquettes and no momentum dependence remains . in this phase three of the links",
    "are zero , and we can fix only 5 of the 6 remaining @xmath94 links to be real . correspondingly only 5 flat zero modes remain .",
    "all the other ( nonzero ) eigenvalues are positive , which means that the plaquette phase is stable .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that , however , the free energy analysis suggests a strong competition of the quasi plaquette state and the chiral sl state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : freeenerg ] ) , the stability analysis shows that the quasi plaquette state collapses towards the lower free energy solution .",
    "the situation is similar to the case when the @xmath158-flux state of the su(2 ) system on square lattice turns out to be unstable and collapse into the so called `` box '' state @xcite .",
    "accordingly , only the chiral sl state remains the lowest lying state at least up to @xmath194 , where its free energy starts to compare with that of the plaquette state . above this temperature the two states have practically the same free energy , and with simple cooling it can not be predicted which phase will stabilize",
    "nevertheless , the two phases have different symmetries and most importantly different topological properties that may allow to select the demanded state .",
    "for example during cooling and yet in the high temperature phase via imprinting a synthetic external gauge field to generate the nontrivial topology of the csl state . at the low temperature state",
    "the enforced topological property remains even when the external constraints are switched off .",
    "in order to study experimental signatures of the different spin liquid and valence bond phases one can look for the experimentally measurable spin - spin correlation function , also known as the structure factor : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the @xmath197-component of the spin operator of a spin-5/2 alkaline earth atom at site @xmath198 , accordingly , @xmath199 is the @xmath197-component of the three su(2 ) generators in 6 dimensional representation . in momentum space and matsubara representation @xmath200 where the numeric factor comes from spin summation : @xmath201 , and the fermionic occupation number at finite temperature is given by the fermi distribution function @xmath202^{-1}$ ] .",
    "@xmath203 and @xmath204 are the eigenenergies and eigenvectors of @xmath127 , respectively , as they were introduced in eq . .",
    "the structure factor @xmath205 in eq . is a @xmath206 matrix in the sublattice space . in order to take into account the total contribution of the unit cell",
    ", one needs to consider its trace , @xmath207 .",
    "we plot the static structure factors in fig .",
    "[ fig : staticstructfact ] of the chiral spin liquid phase a ) and of the quasi plaquette phase b ) . that of the plaquette phase is completely flat due to its dispersionless spectra , and is not shown . for the other two low lying saddle - point solutions",
    "the static structure factors look completely different , both carry unambiguous features to identify them . in the chiral spin liquid phase the structure factor",
    "has a minimum at the center of the brillouin zone ( the @xmath193 point ) and it has maxima at the @xmath208 points . in contrary , in the quasi plaquette phase the structure factor is peaked close to the @xmath193 point and has minima around the edge of the brillouin zone . since the experimentally measurable structure factor of the three lowest lying saddle - point configurations show completely different behavior , it is a suitable tool to distinguish between them .     at zero temperature of the chiral spin liquid phase a ) , the quasi plaquette phase b ) , and the plaquette phase c ) . ]    by radio - frequency - spectroscopy one can measure the spectral density integrated to the whole lattice .",
    "this quantity can also be extracted from the structure factor given by eq . .",
    "it can be obtained by analytically continuing @xmath209 on the the upper half plane of complex frequencies and through the real axis by setting @xmath210 .",
    "@xmath211 with @xmath212 being an infinitesimally small number . in our calculation",
    "we set its value to @xmath213 ( in units of the coupling strength @xmath161 ) .",
    "we plot the spectral density of the three mean - field solutions in fig .",
    "[ fig : specdens ] .",
    "the spectral function of the three different phases looks completely different indicating some characteristic features of the specific phase . while the chiral spin liquid phase ( a ) , and the plaquette phase ( c ) are gapped phases , there are no accessible states up to a gap , the quasi plaquette phase ( b ) is gapless .",
    "furthermore , the plaquette phase is very simple , it contains only 3 delta peaks , also because of the lack of dispersion of the fermion energies .",
    "the first two peaks have twice the strength of the third one according to the fermion spectrum that consists of 4 dispersionless flat bands . from these 4 flat bands",
    "the lowest and the highest energy bands have only one state for every @xmath82 momentum , and between them two doubly degenerate flat bands can be found . at zero temperature the lowest band",
    "is occupied and the higher bands are empty . by exciting a fermion to the upper bands the middle two have twice the number of states than the last one .",
    "in this paper we have studied finite temperature spin liquid and valence bond solid phases of alkaline earth atoms on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "we have determined the lowest free energy solutions in a mean - field level and studied their temperature dependence .",
    "we have found that the spin liquid and valence bond solutions melt at a common critical temperature in the order of the superexchange interaction .",
    "we also studied the stability of the encountered states and have shown that the chiral spin liquid state is indeed the stable saddle - point and the quasi plaquette state is unstable against fluctuations with zero momentum .",
    "the plaquette state is also stable , though with higher free energy .    in experiments cooling the fermions towards quantum degeneracy",
    "is a difficult to achieve goal . though systems of fermions with su(6 ) symmetry seem to be more complicated than the two component su(2 ) fermions , it turned out recently , that experimentally it is easier to cool them towards the magnetic transition @xcite because an isolated 6 component atom can carry away much more entropy than a 2 component one .",
    "this effect is similar to the pomeranchuk cooling first observed in solid @xmath214he @xcite . combining the pomeranchuk cooling with lattice shaking @xcite , which can imprint a nontrivial topology to the system ,",
    "it might be possible to directly cool the su(6 ) symmetric mott insulator into the topologically nontrivial csl state even if its free energy is close to other vbs like phases .",
    "we have also studied the experimentally measurable signatures of the mean - field states , namely the spin - spin correlation function , and its spectral function , of the alkaline earth atoms .",
    "we have shown that these quantities qualitatively differ for the different mean - field solutions and therefore can be used as a smoking gun in experiments to reveal the realized specific phase .    a further method to unambiguously verify whether the state is",
    "the topologically nontrivial csl state would be by probing the existence of chiral edge states . in ref .",
    "@xcite a simple method was introduced to image directly the chiral edge modes .",
    "the method is based on the shaping of the atomic cloud with an extremely steep confining potential and then suddenly removing the confining wall .",
    "after the sudden release of the gas the spatial density evolution of the bulk as well as the edge modes are traceable , and the movement of the chiral edge states becomes directly visible . in order to get better visibility on longer time scale ,",
    "there are two important requirements . on one hand ,",
    "a large initial occupancy of the edge states is required , and on the other hand , it is also important that the edge states contribution to the density has to remain spatially separated from the bulk during the evolution .",
    "the former requirement can be tuned via the density ( fermi energy ) , while the latter one can be ensured by populating a quasi - dispersionless bulk band with non - zero chern number . in ref .",
    "@xcite we demonstrated that the chiral spin liquid state lowest lying bulk band is almost flat , and completely filled , therefore , it is expected that the emerging topological edge states of the chiral sl state as unequivocal signatures of its topological nature can be detected .",
