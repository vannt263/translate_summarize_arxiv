    "the investigation of the disorder induced metal  insulator transition ( mit ) is an exciting and yet unsolved problem in condensed matter physics . during the past almost fifty years of research",
    "many important features have been cleared out using analytical , numerical , and experimental techniques . yet this problem continues to bring interesting and unexpected novelties to daylight .",
    "@xcite    many characteristics of disordered metals and those of insulators have been understood over the past .",
    "the spectral fluctuations of a disordered metal are well described by random matrix theory , while the fluctuations of a system in the insulating regime follow the poisson statistics .",
    "@xcite the nature and the details of the mit , on the other hand , still belong to the most intensively studied problems .",
    "we know already that the spectral fluctuations of a system right at the transition have properties merged from the two extremes .",
    "@xcite however , relations between the spectral and eigenfunction fluctuations show that there is an intimate connection between the two  @xcite which is related to anomalous wave packet spreading and diffusion .",
    "@xcite recently , several works have been devoted to deepen our understanding of the scattering properties of disordered systems by analyzing the distribution of resonance widths and wigner delay times .",
    "@xcite both distribution functions have been shown to be closely related to the properties of the corresponding closed system , i.e. , the fractality of the eigenstates and the critical features of the mit . in this respect ,",
    "detailed analysis have been performed for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) anderson model  @xcite and also for the power law band random matrix ( pbrm ) model .",
    "@xcite the pbrm model , which describes a one - dimensional ( 1d ) sample with random long - range hopping , has been found to provide many of the features of the localization - delocalization transition present in the 3d anderson model .    in the present work",
    "we look at the pbrm model more closely to see how general are the findings presented in refs .  , and . here",
    ", we find good scaling of the distribution functions of resonance widths and wigner delay times .",
    "moreover , we state new scaling relations of their typical values ( i.e. , their geometric mean ) determined by the information dimension , @xmath5 , and the correlation dimension , @xmath6 , of the eigenfunctions of the corresponding closed system .",
    "we note that @xmath6 also governs the spreading of wave packets in systems at the mit.@xcite    finally , we have to mention that in recent microwave experiments the study of systems in which the resonance states resemble the characteristics of those of our interest was reported .",
    "@xcite therefore the direct verification of our results is expected to be available in the near future .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the model we use and define the scattering setup .",
    "section iii is devoted to the analysis of the coupling between sample and lead . in sec .",
    "iv we present our results for the distribution functions of resonance widths and wigner delay times .",

    "nevertheless , for sites far away from each other and the border , i.e. , @xmath12 , the variance decays with a power law @xmath13 field - theoretical considerations  @xcite and detailed numerical investigations  @xcite verified that the pbrm model undergoes a transition at @xmath14 from localized states for @xmath15 to delocalized states for @xmath16 .",
    "this transition shows all the key features of the anderson mit , including multifractality of eigenfunctions and non - trivial spectral statistics at the critical point . at the center of the spectral - band a theoretical estimation for the multifractal dimensions , @xmath17 , of the eigenfunction @xmath18 gives  @xcite @xmath19^{-1 } ,   & b \\ll 1 \\nonumber\\\\   1-q(2\\pi b)^{-1 } , & b\\gg 1 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the gamma function .",
    "@xmath17 is defined through the rnyi entropy  @xcite of the participation number  @xcite @xmath21 where the participation number is defined as @xmath22 showing a nontrivial scaling with respect to the linear size of the system @xmath2 .",
    "thus model ( [ pbrm ] ) possesses a line of critical points @xmath23 , where the multifractal dimensions @xmath17 change with @xmath10 .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath10 describes the strength of disorder . in other words",
    "it is related to the classical conductance through the relation  @xcite @xmath24 , where @xmath25 stands for the global symmetry of the system : @xmath26 describes the presence and @xmath27 the absence of time reversal symmetry .    among all dimensions ,",
    "the information dimension @xmath5 and the correlation dimension @xmath6 play a prominent role.@xcite however , @xmath5 is obtained as the @xmath28 limit of eq .",
    "( [ re ] ) , being the scaling of the shannon entropy .",

    "= 8.4 cm    we turn the isolated system to a scattering one by attaching one semi - infinite single channel lead to it .",
    "the lead is described by the following 1d tight - binding hamiltonian : @xmath35    using standard methods  @xcite one can write the scattering matrix ( a single complex number for one attached lead ) in the form  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an @xmath7 unit matrix and @xmath38 is an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian given by @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is an @xmath41 vector with elements @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the coupling strength between sample and lead and @xmath44 is the site at which the lead is attached .",
    "all our calculations take place in an energy window close to the band center @xmath45 .",
    "then , the wigner delay time is given by  @xcite @xmath46    = 8.4 cm    in addition to the delay times , which captures the time - dependent aspects of quantum scattering , the poles of the scattering matrix are also of great relevance .",
    "@xcite they determine the conductance fluctuations of a quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime  @xcite or the current relaxation .",
    "@xcite the poles of the scattering matrix show up as resonances , which are the complex eigenvalues @xmath47 of @xmath48 . @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the position and width of the @xmath51th resonance , respectively .",
    "of course for @xmath52 the real part of the poles , @xmath49 , correspond to the eigenvalues of the closed system .",
    "the @xmath50s , on the other hand , are related to the lifetime of the resonances through @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we may expect close correspondence between wigner delay times and the resonance widths which , in fact , we calculate independently from each other .",
    "bellow we use matrices of sizes varying from @xmath54 up to @xmath55 to compute probability distribution functions of scattering phases @xmath56 , wigner delay times @xmath0 , and resonance widths @xmath1 . for statistical processing",
    "a large number of disorder realizations is used . in the case of @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "we have at least @xmath59 data values . for the statistics of @xmath1 we use the eigenvalues around @xmath60 , about one tenth of the total spectra . here",
    ", at least @xmath61 data values are used .",
    "in this section we define more precisely the way the lead is attached to the system under the condition of perfect coupling .",
    "we should first note that the lead is attached to any site ( chosen at random ) within the sample and that the ensemble average also implies average over the position of the lead .",
    "the value of the coupling strength , @xmath43 , is defined by analyzing the distribution of the scattering phases @xmath57 .",
    "see also ref .  .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] we present @xmath57 for various values of @xmath10 and @xmath2 .",
    "we use ( here and bellow ) the coupling strengths @xmath43 such that @xmath62 , where the corresponding setup is associated with perfect coupling between sample and lead .",
    "@xmath63 is the ensemble average of the @xmath64 matrix .",
    "notice that for @xmath65 we recover the uniform distribution .",
    "moreover , in this case , the expression  @xcite @xmath66 holds ( not shown here ) ; where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "= 8.4 cm    = 8.4 cm    = 8.4 cm    = 8.4 cm    = 8.4 cm",
    "we first have to mention that moments of the the inverse wigner delay time have been ( numerically and analytically ) shown to be related to the multifractal dimensions of eigenfunctions as  @xcite @xmath69 although the validity of this relation depends strongly whether the lead is attached to a site inside or at the border of the sample .",
    "however , in the case of the periodic pbrm model , studied here , all sites are _ generic _ and eq .",
    "( [ scaletw ] ) holds well ( not shown here ) .",
    "now , let us turn to the main results of our present investigation .",
    "we have looked at the distribution of wigner delay times as well as that of the resonance widths a little bit differently , compared to previous works .",
    "first we tried to obtain a universal ( i.e. , @xmath2 independent ) form of the distribution function @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "however , for small @xmath10 the relation @xmath72 does not hold and we have found a breakdown of the scaling of @xmath73 with @xmath2 , in contrast to the expectation according to ref .  .    instead of @xmath74",
    "we decided to look at the typical value of @xmath0 : @xmath75 .",
    "we found that @xmath76 shows a good scaling with @xmath2 and a tendency to a universal distribution ( for each @xmath10 ) as @xmath77 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we also plot @xmath78 to see the behavior of the tails of @xmath76 , where @xmath79 here , only for @xmath80 we see a clear decay of the form @xmath81 . notice that the value of the exponent is the same as the one found in ref .   for @xmath82 in the case of the 3d anderson model .",
    "in view of eq .",
    "( [ scaletw ] ) we may estimate the scaling behavior of @xmath83 . using a simple relation  @xcite @xmath84 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath85 this is contrasted with the numerical results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6a ] where we plot @xmath86 as a function of @xmath10 . here",
    ", @xmath86 is extracted from the scaling @xmath87 ( see the insets in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the data agree well with eq .",
    "( [ ttypscal ] ) .",
    "= 8.4 cm    in the case of resonance widths , we observe an excellent scaling of @xmath88 for all values of @xmath10 and the approach to a universal distribution ( for each @xmath10 ) as @xmath77 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] . here , @xmath89 . also , from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] we observe that as @xmath77 , the integrated distribution function follows a power law decay @xmath90 for all values of @xmath10 in complete agreement with refs .   and .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6b ] we plot @xmath91 as a function of @xmath10 where @xmath91 is extracted from the scaling @xmath92 ( see the insets in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "we found that @xmath91 is well approximated by @xmath93 .",
    "notice that in the limit @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , we recover the full random matrix limit in which case we also have @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this means , for instance , that as @xmath94 , @xmath98 , where the later scaling was found in ref .   for the 3d anderson model .",
    "in figs .  [",
    "fig : fig6a ] and [ fig : fig6b ] we see that the two quantities , @xmath83 and @xmath99 , behave very similarly and in the limit of weak multifractality , @xmath100 , we nicely recover the features of the 3d anderson transition .",
    "@xcite moreover , this similarity calls for a simple scaling law @xmath101",
    "we have presented an analysis of the scattering properties of the pbrm model with one lead attached to it .",
    "especially , the system with large conductance ( weak multifractality ) shows remarkable correspondence with the properties of the standard 3d anderson model at criticality .",
    "this is in accordance with earlier findings .",
    "we have also found a novel relation between the scaling of the shannon entropy , described by @xmath5 , and the typical values of the wigner delay times ; as well as a relation between the scaling exponent of the participation number @xmath33 , described by @xmath6 , and the resonance widths . on the other hand",
