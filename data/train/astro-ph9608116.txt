    "any acceptable theory for growth of structure has to pass the tests imposed by observations in our local ( @xmath9 ) universe . among those the most stringent",
    "is provided by observations of clusters of galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; pen 1996 ) , simply because they probe the tail of a gaussian ( or alike ) distribution , which depends extremely strongly on some otherwise fairly stable quantities such as the rms of density fluctuation amplitude .",
    "in addition , a model has to match cobe observations of the universe at the epoch of recombination ( @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of these two relatively fixed points defines the shape and amplitude of the assumed power spectrum , thus significantly limiting the allowable parameter space for the gaussian family of the cold dark matter cosmological models ; one is essentially left undecided how to adjust the following three parameters : @xmath10 , @xmath8 or @xmath11 , where @xmath10 is the primordial power spectrum index , @xmath8 the current cosmological constant and @xmath11 density parameter of the hot dark matter .",
    "critical differentiators are likely to come from areas which are as far removed as possible from both cobe epoch ( on large scales ) and our local vantage point ( on scales of @xmath12mpc ) .    in the intervening redshifts , among those accessible to current observations , the @xmath0 forest observed in spectra of high redshift quasars ( e.g. , carswell 1991 ; rauch 1993 ; petitjean 1993 ; schneider 1993 ; cristiani 1995 ; hu 1995 ; tytler 1995 ; lanzetta 1995 ; bahcall 1996 ) provides possibly the single richest set of information about the structure of the universe at low - to - moderate redshift .",
    "furthermore , each line of sight to a distant quasar indiscriminately samples the distribution of neutral hydrogen gas ( hence total gas ) over a wide redshift range ( @xmath13 ) in a _ random _ fashion ( i.e. , a quasar and foreground absorbing material are unrelated ) ; thus , the @xmath0 forest constitutes perhaps the _ fairest _ sample of the cosmic structure in its observed redshift range .",
    "the new _ ab initio _ modeling of @xmath0 clouds by following the gravitational growth of baryonic density fluctuations on small - to - intermediate scales ( @xmath14kpc to several mpc in comoving length units ) produced a remarkably successful account of the many observed properties of @xmath0 clouds ( cen 1994 ; zhang 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ; miralda - escud 1996 ) .",
    "however , at first sight it appears that three _ different _ cosmological models  a cdm+@xmath15 model ( hubble constant @xmath16 km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; cen 1994 ) , a biased critical density cdm model ( @xmath22 km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ; hernquist 1996 ) , and a high amplitude critical density cdm model ( @xmath26 km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; zhang 1995 )  all approximately fit observations , gauged by column density distribution , doppler width @xmath30 distribution , etc .",
    "while the overall agreement between models and observations is encouraging from an astrophysicist s point of view because it implies that the physical environment produced by the hydrocodes of widely distributed photoionized gas does correspond to the real world , it seems that more sensitive tests are demanded from a cosmologist s point of view in order to test models . in this _",
    "letter _ we show that a statistic based on the @xmath0 flux distribution may serve as a potentially strong discriminator between cosmological models .",
    "we argue that , while the column density distribution is useful in providing information about the @xmath0 clouds , it requires post - observation fitting procedures such as line profile fitting and line deblending , and it consequently superimposed by additional uncertainties related to the procedures themselves .",
    "naively , it may seem that measures based on the flux ( or optical depth ) distribution may be redundant given that we already have the traditional column density distribution .",
    "but we note that in complex multivariate problems ( kendall 1980 ) such as that of the @xmath0 forest it should not be taken for granted that a one - to - one correspondence or correlation between the two exists . in other words",
    ", two different flux distributions may yield a similar column density distribution considering the many factors involved , including real space clustering , thermal broadening , peculiar velocity effect and line profile fitting .",
    "therefore , it may be profitable to deal directly with the flux distribution .",
    "we use two of the current popular models  the cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ( @xmath15cdm ) and the mixed hot and cold dark matter model ( mdm )  to demonstrate the applicability of the statistic .",
    "we begin by showing the variance of the density fluctuations ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 calculated using linear theory ) as a function of the comoving radius of a sphere in the @xmath15cdm model ( solid curve ) and the mdm model ( dashed curve ) at @xmath4 in figure 1 .",
    "both the @xmath15cdm model ( hubble constant @xmath16 km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) and the mdm model ( @xmath22 km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath25 ; ma 1996 ) are normalized to both cobe on large scales and local galaxy cluster abundance ( on scales of @xmath12mpc comoving ) . both models involve a slight tilt of the spectrum ( plus some small gravitational wave contribution to the temperature fluctuations on large scales in the @xmath15cdm model ) in order to achieve the indicated @xmath37 values .",
    "we see a somewhat _ modest _ difference in the amplitude of density fluctuations in the two models .",
    "the density fluctuations are larger in the @xmath15cdm than in the mdm model by ( 26% , 33% ) on scales of ( @xmath38mpc , @xmath39mpc ) , respectively .",
    "focusing on the high end of the optical depth distribution the following statistic is examined for the purpose of testing cosmological models  the fraction of pixels in a quasar spectrum with @xmath0 optical depth greater than @xmath2 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the cumulative distribution of @xmath0 optical depth . in figure 2",
    ", we show the results of the @xmath15cdm model ( thick solid curve ) and the mdm model ( thick dashed curve ) obtained from detailed synthetic @xmath0 spectra ( miralda - escud 1996 ) .",
    "a sampling bin of 2.0 km  s@xmath17 is used and the spectrum is degraded by a point spread function with a 6.0 km  s@xmath17 fwhm . note that noise is _",
    "not _ added for the two thick curves in figure 2 .",
    "the boxsize , resolution and physics input of the two simulations are identical ( for details of the @xmath15cdm model see miralda - escud 1996 ) .",
    "the differences between the two model simulations are : 1 ) different input power spectra , 2 ) different background models and , 3 ) there is one additional ( hot ) dark matter species in the mdm simulation .",
    "ionization equilibrium between photoionization and recombination is assumed .",
    "we require that the average flux decrement in each model , @xmath42 , be equal to the observed value , @xmath43 at @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is achieved by adjusting the following parameter : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is hubble constant in units of @xmath46km / s / mpc , @xmath47 is the mean baryonic density and @xmath48 is the hydrogen photonization rate .",
    "this normalization procedure for the flux distribution is _ necessary _ in order to fix its overall amplitude , due to the large uncertainties of the observed values of @xmath47 and @xmath49 .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath50 are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , for the @xmath15cdm and the mdm models ( note that the value of @xmath50 for the mdm model is obtained after the temperature of the intergalactic medium in the model is raised ; see below ) .",
    "although the @xmath15cdm model yields temperature of the clouds consistent with observations , as indicated by the @xmath30 parameter distribution ( miralda - escud 1996 ) , it is found that the mean temperature of the intergalactic medium in the mdm model at @xmath4 is unrealistically low with @xmath53  kelvin ( compared to @xmath54  kelvin in the @xmath15cdm ) .",
    "the reason is that our self - consistent treatment of structure formation ( star / galaxy formation ) and ionizing radiation field does not produce sufficient photo - ionization / photo - heating of the intergalactic medium due to the very small fraction of baryons which have collapsed to form stars or quasars in the mdm model by @xmath4 [ for details of our treatment of atomic processes , radiation , and galaxy formation see cen ( 1992 ) and cen & ostriker ( 1993 ) ]",
    ". it would be meaningless had we generated the @xmath0 spectrum for the mdm model using such low temperature .",
    "instead , we uniformly raise the gas temperature in the mdm model to @xmath55  kelvin ( but retain other properties of the gas including density and velocity ) , and then generate the @xmath0 spectrum with thermal broadening effect of the gas of the putative high temperature . to test the sensitivity of the results on the artificial temperature adjustment in the mdm model , we also compute the results by raising the temperature to @xmath56  kelvin and @xmath57  kelvin , respectively .",
    "we find that at @xmath58 , the results are @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 for three cases with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64  kelvin , respectively .",
    "one more experiment is made for the mdm model : instead of setting the temperature uniformly to @xmath55  kelvin , @xmath55  kelvin is _ added _ uniformly to the temperature of each cell , and we find the results of @xmath1 for the two cases are indistinguishable within the quoted digits , at all three @xmath2 s .",
    "it seems that the results depend only weakly on the temperature within the reasonable range , with the trend that higher temperatures yield lower fractions of pixels with high optical depth .",
    "we find that @xmath65 and @xmath66 , at @xmath58 , respectively , i.e. , a difference between the two models by a factor of @xmath67 at the three @xmath2 s .",
    "it is likely that the high end of the @xmath0 optical depth distribution in the mdm model ( thick dashed curve ) would be further reduced , had we run the simulation with sufficient ( i.e. realistic ) photo - ionization / photo - heating , since reduced cooling and increased thermal pressure would result in less condensation of dense regions responsible for high @xmath0 optical depth considered here .",
    "the countervailing effect is that the current mdm simulation may have overcooled the dense clouds , making them much smaller thus much less capable of intercepting qso lines of sight .",
    "however , examinations of the cloud sizes and densities in the dense regions as well as the found trend of higher temperatures yielding lower high optical depth fraction ( see the preceding paragraph ) indicate that this effect is unimportant for the mdm model ; there do not seem to exist superdense clouds in the mdm model . in short",
    ", we anticipate that a more realistic mdm simulation with higher photoionization field would produce even smaller @xmath2 than that of the current mdm simulation .",
    "it is clear from figure 2 that the higher the @xmath2 , the more model - differentiating power @xmath1 possesses .",
    "however , detecting high @xmath2 is difficult due to noise and telescope systematics . to see how noise affects the statistic , we generated synthetic spectra with noise added in the following way . by definition ,",
    "the signal to noise ratio at the continuum is s / n@xmath68 , where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and s / n are the number of source photons at the continuum , the number of noise photons and the signal to noise ratio , respectively , per frequency pixel .",
    "thus , given s / n and @xmath70 , we can obtain @xmath69 . to simplify the illustration ( without loss of generality ) we assume that @xmath70 is dominated by the detector readout noise .",
    "this is a good approximation only for a bright quasar where the number of sky photons are small ( due to a shorter exposure time ) compared to the readout noise of , say , a ccd detector .",
    "for example , the gain of the hires ccd detector on the keck telescope is 6.1 electrons , so the number of photons due to the ccd readout noise integrated over 5 spatial pixels ( for each frequency bin ) is @xmath71 . for a @xmath72 mag quasar at @xmath73a with 1-hr integration time ,",
    "about 4 photons from the sky per spatial pixel , giving a total count of sky photons per frequency pixel ( integrated over the 5 spatial pixels ) of only 20 photons ( see , e.g. , hu 1995 ) .",
    "a frequency pixel in the simulated noise - free spectrum with flux @xmath74 contains @xmath75 photons .",
    "when noise is added , the  observed \" number of photons ( subtracted by the known ccd noise ) in the pixel will be @xmath76 , where @xmath77 means a poisson distributed random number with the mean equal to @xmath78 .",
    "the resultant distributions [ @xmath79 are also shown in figure 2 for three continuum signal to noise ratios of s / n@xmath80 for each model ( thin solid curves for the @xmath15cdm model and thin dashed curves for the mdm model ) .",
    "the @xmath81 statistical errorbars are also shown for the case with s / n@xmath82 ( other cases have comparable errorbars but are not shown to maintain the readability of the plot ) , assuming a quasar absorption spectrum coverage of unit redshift range about z=3 with a sampling bin of @xmath83 km  s@xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath84 value of the hires ccd detector is adopted in the calculation .",
    "we see that three values of s / n@xmath80 are able to preserve the differences between the two models up to @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "another complication , telescope systematics , may cause further difficulties .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that @xmath1 for @xmath3 can be fairly accurately obtained with a high statistical accuracy in good keck spectra [ e.g. , womble , sargent , & lyons ( 1995 ) achieved a typical signal to noise ratio of 150 per resolution element using the hires spectrograph on the keck telescope ] .",
    "a preliminary comparison of the simulation results using @xmath1 with observations ( rauch 1997 , figure 1 ) at @xmath3 at @xmath86 appears that the result of the @xmath15cdm model matches the observed value well ( @xmath87 computed versus @xmath88 observed ) , while the mdm model seems to predict a value ( @xmath89 ) lower than observed .",
    "this study illustrates that high quality quasar @xmath0 absorption spectra are potentially useful to discriminate between cosmological models .",
    "it is demonstrated that the @xmath1 statistic  the cumulative probability of a spectrum with @xmath0 optical depth greater than a high value @xmath2 ( @xmath90 )  serves as an amplifier of the differences between models .",
    "we show that a modest difference ( @xmath91 ) in the mean amplitudes translates into a large difference in the two @xmath1 s ( by a factor larger than 2.0 for @xmath92 ) between the @xmath15cdm model and the mdm model at @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath1 is at the level of 0.01 to 0.1 , i.e. , the relevant regions with @xmath93 cover a sizable portion of a quasar spectrum .",
    "therefore , one is _ not _ dealing with small number statistics , ensuring that @xmath1 is a potentially accurately determinable statistic statistically .",
    "the statistic is also _ simple _ in that it does not involve complicated procedures such as line profile fitting , and hence can be directly applied to the observed flux distribution .",
    "in addition to the need of a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n@xmath94 for @xmath95 ) , it is essential that telescope systematics be understood and scattered noise photons be minimized , which may push one to focus on the brightest quasars at this time .",
    "furthermore , it is required that the spectroscopic resolution be sufficiently high so that @xmath0 optical depth can be reliably extracted from the observed flux .",
    "the latter requirement is equivalent to having a fwhm less the doppler width , which seems readily satisfied with current observations .",
    "finally , we note that a stable normalization procedure for the overall flux distribution is necessary due to large uncertainties in @xmath47 and @xmath49 .",
    "we adopt @xmath96 as a normalization parameter in this work .",
    "the primary difficulty in fixing @xmath96 is to determine the continuum , which is fairly obscured by heavy absorption at high redshift ( compare , e.g. , zuo & lu 1993 and @xcite to see the situation ) ; the situation is better at lower redshift .",
    "it is equally essential to determine the robustness of the prediction of a theoretical model for the proposed statistic .",
    "this may only be made definitive by performing many simulations with varying input parameters including the ionization radiation field , baryonic density , feedback processes , simulation resolution and simulation volume ( boxsize ) .",
    "it is expected , however , that all these effects may not change results significantly .",
    "let us take an example to illustrate this conjecture .",
    "a @xmath0 cloud with a column density of @xmath97@xmath98 and a doppler width @xmath99 km  s@xmath17 has a central @xmath0 optical depth of @xmath100 .",
    "since these clouds are not cooling efficiently ( cooling time is longer than the hubble time ) , cooling effects are likely to be small , implying that changing radiation field or baryonic density would have a small dynamic effect within plausible ranges .",
    "for the same reason , these clouds are not effective in forming stars , therefore feedback effect may be small ( which , if any , may be due to nearby star forming regions , which may be much rarer . )",
    "these clouds are also found to be relatively large and well resolved in our current simulations , but small compared to the simulation boxsize , so an increase of simulation resolution or boxsize would not affect the statistic substantially .",
    "lastly , we note that , since the relevant regions are optically thin to lyman limit photons , self - shielding effects are likely to be unimportant .",
    "so it appears that @xmath1 is a relatively _ easy _ statistic to determine theoretically .",
    "we anticipate that the evolution of different models may be quite different , due to the dependence of the growth of density fluctuations on @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( peebles 1980 ) , possibly coupled with other nonlinear , redshift dependent thermal / dynamical effects .",
    "the redshift evolution of @xmath1 , computable with both observations and simulations of different models , may be potentially revealing .",
    "it is conceivable that we can constrain the amplitude of density fluctuations on small - to - intermediate scales as a function of redshift using observations of @xmath0 clouds , thus possibly constrain @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
