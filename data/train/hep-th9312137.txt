    "physical reality can be approached by means of quantum field theory from different perspectives .",
    "this in particular depends on the kind of information one is interested to extract in order to solve a problem under consideration but it is also influenced by the individual view toward the fundamental difficulties met in present day standard quantum field theory ( and its generalized concepts like string theory ) . to a large extent , these different approaches reflect technical difficulties to fully ( in particular , nonperturbatively ) understand quantum field theoretical models rather than really differences in concept on a fundamental level .",
    "however , few pioneers of quantum field theory like dirac @xcite,@xcite and feynman @xcite,@xcite in particular pointing to the uv divergency problem always maintained the view that the right theory has not yet been found .",
    "this attitude has apparently not received majority support in time but in this respect it does not seem to exist any majority opinion at all . from this state of affairs we feel free to draw justification for a reconsideration of certain conceptual foundations of quantum field theory constituting the purpose of the present paper .",
    "+ notwithstanding above mentioned problems , it seems to exist wide agreement that the scattering matrix can be considered as the fundamental object for describing a particular quantum field theoretic model .",
    "this amounts to saying that full knowledge of the complete scattering matrix is considered equivalent to the solution of a quantum field theory and all interesting information , at least in principle , can be extracted from it .",
    "construction of the scattering matrix can be attempted by different methods .",
    "for instance , the so - called s - matrix theory as studied in the 1950s in reaction to the emergence of the divergency problem in lagrangian quantum field theory was designed to find the ( finite ) scattering matrix from rather general fundamental principles like causality , unitarity , lorentz invariance using dispersion techniques without making reference to any lagrangian underlying the theory ( see @xcite,@xcite , e.g. ) . however , although quite general and interesting results have been obtained principles applied turned out not restrictive enough to completely fix the scattering matrix for realistic theories . nowadays , after the successful re - emergence of ( renormalizable ) lagrangian quantum field theory at the end of the 1960s description of the scattering matrix is supplied in a standard way in terms of the effective action of the theory considered @xcite . in this sense",
    ", we may view the effective action as the genuine fundamental object of interest and will concentrate on its study in this article .",
    "+ historically , beyond the s - matrix theory already mentioned attempts to cure uv divergencies by nonlocal field theories played a particular role since the emergence of the divergency problem in the 1930s ( for a review including references see @xcite,@xcite ; also @xcite ) .",
    "although it has been recognized early that nonlocal field theories may be accompanied by new , perhaps even more unpleasant difficulties , so with unitarity and ( macro-)causality , theoretical thinking in this direction never ceased to exist .",
    "most prominent , present day string theory although much more ambitious can be viewed as a particular way of giving preference to a special kind of nonlocality @xcite . in recent years",
    ", few papers were again dealing with nonlocal quantum gauge field theories @xcite@xcite ( to mention only this subject ) where in part the nonlocalities introduced are understood as regulators .",
    "although having a different aim than fighting uv divergencies , also the average action concept proposed recently should be mentioned here @xcite,@xcite . in principle , the drawback of all these nonlocal approaches however consists in the arbitrariness in the choice of the nonlocality introduced .",
    "so far , no unique recipe starting from first principles has been proposed .",
    "+ however , the dominant paradigm in the field remains local renormalizable lagrangian quantum field theory ( throughout the paper we will denote it by the term standard quantum field theory . ) .",
    "but , also there nonlocality is a well - known phenomenon because it is a feature of the effective action that can be derived for any quantum field theory ( either local or nonlocal ) and which also serves ( in most cases ) as generating functional of the one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) green functions . in general ,",
    "the effective action is attributed different meanings by different authors .",
    "few regard the effective action as some low energy representation of a quantum field theory obtained by integrating out certain ( massive ) degrees of freedom , while others consider the effective action as a full fledged description of the model under investigation from which arbitrary s - matrix elements ( related to any observation one might be able to perform ) can be derived .",
    "we will stick here to the latter view . to us , very pragmatically the effective action is that object which contains all the information ever to be measured under certain defined circumstances and there is no other ( independent ) object linking theory to physical reality .",
    "the shape of the effective action of course may depend on some of these circumstances ( external conditions , e.g. ) .",
    "a similar point of view has recently been described with respect to the gravitational effective action by vilkovisky @xcite .",
    "the effective action concept we have in mind aims at quantum field theoretic models , especially those which are realistic like qed , and assumes that certain sectors of physical reality can be described in a consistent way independently of each other .",
    "it is therefore quite different from the toe ( theory of everything ) concept often related to superstring theory .",
    "+ in short , the program of the present article can be described by saying that we intend to find a concept which allows to determine the structure of the ( highly complex ) observable effective action without making reference to any other quantity not accessible to observation . in particular",
    ", the approach to quantum field theory will be based on a critical attitude towards the distinction artificial from an experimental point of view between the so - called classical action and the effective action . this way we will be lead to propose an equation for determining the ( finite ) effective action , which can be understood as a certain fixed point condition .",
    "it will be an equation for functionals of fields ( actions ) and is therefore designed to remove ( to a certain extent  the field content has to be prescribed as usual ) the arbitrariness in the choice of the lagrangian standing at the beginning of any field theory .",
    "such however can only be expected to happen for interacting theories , where our approach differs from the established paradigm . for free field theories , where this is not the case , nothing new is accomplished in this respect . as technical tool we rely on the functional integral formulation of lagrangian quantum field theory which seems to be the appropriate and most convenient language for the description of our concept . while nonlocality will be an inherent feature of our approach in most cases , it is by no means the conceptual starting point of the present investigation .",
    "of course , the program as just sketched is an abstract one .",
    "however , once we have proposed the general concept it will simply serve us as a guiding line for finding an appropriate approximative approach to perform explicit calculations ( in this article : in qed as the prototype gauge field theory ) .",
    "+ in the past decade the effective action concept has received interest from the point of view of its invariant geometrical formulation .",
    "this is an important step in ensuring the physical relevance of the effective action because its physical consequences should not depend on the particular choice of coordinates for the field variables .",
    "initial work in this direction traces back to vilkovisky @xcite,@xcite and dewitt @xcite , for a recent discussion of the geometrical effective action see @xcite , for a review including further references @xcite . for the purpose of the present article ( to reduce complexity of the considerations )",
    "we simply bypass the subject and maintain that always those field coordinates are applied in terms of which the formalism takes it naive ( non - geometrical ) shape .",
    "furthermore , for gauge field theories , a main concern of the unique ( geometrical ) effective action concept , we find that generalized landau gauge is the only sensible gauge .",
    "inasmuch as for gauge field theories the geometrical effective action has been found to agree with the naive one ( calculated by means of the standard background field method ) exactly for generalized landau gauge we feel free to ignore the subject also there @xcite@xcite .",
    "+ the outline of the article is as follows . in chapter 2",
    "we explain the general concept in some length .",
    "this is done in three steps . in section 2.1 based on a methodological analysis",
    "we establish a quest for an equation for the complete effective action . while section 2.2 serves to suggest a particular answer to this question by imposing a certain fixed point condition in terms of a functional integral equation section 2.3 discusses some features of this equation , among others the relation between standard quantum field theory and the present approach .",
    "chapter 3 then applies the concept to gauge field theories .",
    "specifically , there we formulate the functional integral equation for the complete effective action of qed and then in sections 3.1 and 3.2 ward - takahashi identities and schwinger - dyson equations are discussed respectively .",
    "chapter 4 contains the major body of the explicit calculation performed .",
    "the model under investigation is qed in 4d minkowski ( euclidean ) space .",
    "while section 4.1 spells out what kind of approximative approach to the functional integral equation for the complete effective action of qed is applied in general section 4.2 and its subsections serve to establish a more concrete approximation strategy suited for explicit calculation and are concentrating on the quadratic kernels of the action .",
    "subsections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 discuss certain general requirements on the quadratic kernels of the fermion and gauge field actions respectively while subsection 4.2.3 explains the approximation strategy finally chosen .",
    "section 4.3 also split into several subsections then presents the explicit calculation in some detail .",
    "subsection 4.3.1 contains technical details of the functional integration performed . while for the quadratic kernel of the gauge field action we rely on a certain ansatz subsection 4.3.2 establishes an integral equation for the quadratic kernel of the fermion action .",
    "this integral equation is then approximatively solved in subsections 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.2.2 in the asymptotic uv and ir regions respectively",
    ". this analysis yields certain nonperturbative information about the quadratic kernel of the fermion action . in the final subsection 4.3.3 of chapter 4 as particular application of the present method the approximative calculation of the qed coupling constant @xmath0",
    "is explicitly studied .",
    "it is understood as one of the characteristics of a fixed point given as a solution of the functional integral equation proposed .",
    "certain technical details of the calculation described in chapter 4 are deferred to two appendices at the end of the article .",
    "chapter 5 shortly discusses the vacuum energy problem for qed on the 1-loop level .",
    "final consideration then is devoted to the relevance of the proposed approach to the induced gravity concept .",
    "the article closes in chapter 6 with a discussion of some aspects of the results obtained .",
    "as introductory step let us begin with displaying key elements of the standard formulation of the effective action . we consider lagrangian quantum field theory in flat ( minkowski ) space - time and in this chapter we use scalar field theory to pursue the discussion .",

    "+ above consideration justifies following view .",
    "once the functional integral measure is constructed ( and typically this is done for a whole class of classical actions and then fixed forever ) the classical action @xmath21 uniquely determines the corresponding effective action @xmath20 . in other words ,",
    "the effective action does not contain more information than ( implicitly ) contained in the classical action ( supplemented by the functional integral measure ) .",
    "this point is usually not stressed in studying concrete models due to the calculational complexity involved .",
    "although it is of next to no practical ( i.e. , calculational ) relevance therefore , it involves important methodological implications . the most important one consist in the fact that the effective action does not appear as object in its own right but as a derived quantity only .",
    "mere reformulations of the calculational tools used to determine the effective action , like schwinger - dyson equations , e.g. , do not change this character . + before proceeding further let us mention that formulas ( [ ba1])([ba5 ] ) reflect two features of modern quantum field theory . on one hand side , they stand for the convincing success of quantum field theory as witnessed in the last few decades , of a theory providing us with operational instruments producing numbers which agree with measurement to a degree not seen elsewhere in physics ( or in any other science ) . on the other hand",
    ", they also stand for the fundamental conceptual difficulties inherent to local quantum field theory .",
    "the most important of them is manifesting itself in terms of the well - known ultraviolet divergencies .",
    "although there exist two or three ( different ) mainstream opinions with respect to this issue ( and some other , related ones ) numerous dissenting ones can also be found . from this observation",
    "one may conclude that research apparently has not yet lead to any generally accepted concept explaining and removing the problems in a finally convincing manner as judged from physics as an inherently consistent building combining theory and experiment .",
    "this amounts to saying that search in different directions seems justified and even certain doubt in the foundations of quantum field theory should not be rejected at once . with this in mind , in what follows we will apply the point of view that perhaps even certain foundations of quantum field theory are not understood up to their end and we will see whether we can throw different light on them . in this context , as outlined in the introduction , we will focus on the effective action which we consider as the appropriate object to be studied .",
    "+ let us ask for principles effective actions should be governed by in general . while we have no problem in giving principles they should obey , like lorentz invariance , cpt invariance , e.g. , the answer to the question what they are in detail determined by in view of considerations given further above reduces to saying that they are uniquely given as image of the corresponding classical action by means of the map @xmath19 containing information about the functional integral measure .",
    "this way , the question is traced back to the uncertainty in classical field theory what lagrangian to choose . although , one does not necessarily need to worry about this point here we will",
    ". basically , we prescribe an effective action in terms of some low energy information rather than to find it from independent ( quantum ) principles not exhausted by fixing the classical action . and",
    ", if we are honest , at best we may say that our prescription is approximately right .",
    "+ one may now confront the methodological insight obtained so far with the deductive idea often applied in theoretical physics that the special case ( here the classical action ) should be derived from the more general one ( here the effective action ) and not the other way around . in this sense",
    ", the complete effective action is the genuine fundamental object to be studied .",
    "if so , up to further investigation , one is willing to allow that the complete effective action might be an object in its own right then one has to find a method of determining the complete effective action differing from the established method .",
    "there are not so many methods available and to use an equation for determining the complete effective action seems to be an approach natural within theoretical physics .",
    "therefore , above view leads to the task to find such an equation for the complete effective action .",
    "+ to the best of the authors knowledge such a question has not been raised so far in the existing literature .",
    "independent of the kind of further answer to it , it should be emphasized that in view of the fundamental role of the effective action in quantum field theory it deserves one .",
    "even rejection of the question ( e.g. , by closely sticking to the established formalism ) has important methodological consequences as we have demonstrated above .",
    "+ search for an equation for the complete effective action needs to be ruled by a couple of principles .",
    "first , solutions of such an equation should be able to reproduce standard quantum field theoretic result with the required accuracy in order to stay in line with experiment .",
    "obviously , this leaves not much room for an answer differing from the known one .",
    "second , the formalism connected with such an equation should sufficiently differ from standard quantum field theory in order to be able to remove known problems , at least in part . and third , any sensible search for an equation for the complete effective action should take into account that the eventual result needs to be sufficiently general in order to be applicable to various situations and has to be restrictive enough at the same time in order to allow to derive from it concrete information .",
    "+ while the call for an equation for the complete effective action still might be shared by a number of researchers and probably represents the least disputable part of the present investigation , to reach agreement with respect to an eventual answer to it very likely will be much more difficult . in the following section we are going to propose an answer which then shall be investigated in some further detail . +      basically , there are two different routes to find the particular answer on the question put forward in the preceding section we prefer by proposing a specific equation for the complete effective action",
    ". one way is to discuss certain principles to be built in and then to write down an equation which embodies these .",
    "the other way which we will choose now is heuristically to motivate an equation which then will be analyzed with respect to its conceptual content .",

    "is to ask which effective action term is induced and which is not because eq .",
    "( [ bb6 ] ) is a self - consistency condition .",
    "+ continuing above consideration , it should be mentioned that already in standard quantum field theory there is no difference in principle between a certain mode of vacuum fluctuations and macroscopic ( external ) fields .",
    "this is reflected by the insight that the effective action has a dual nature , namely on one hand side it is considered as action governing the behaviour of macroscopic ( external ) fields and at the same time it is the generating functional of 1pi green functions playing herewith a central role in describing vacuum fluctuations . in addition , any particular mode of vacuum fluctuations is acting in the background of all of them and merely experiences their total effective impact as described by the complete effective action .",
    "therefore , the path integral construction should not rely on the classical action governing the weight of each path ( mode ) as is done in standard quantum field theory but the weight of each path ( mode ) should be determined by the complete effective action expressing the vacuum properties in total .",

    "we may say that eq.([bb6 ] ) is the theoretical expression of the dual nature of the complete effective action being effective action and generating functional at the same time .",
    "in other words , vacuum fluctuations are governed by one and the same action like macroscopic phenomena .",

    "this requirement of structural similarity perhaps could be sufficient to keep the conceptual content alive and at the same time admits to count indeed ( not only seemingly ) in any arguments on the eventual smallness of @xmath0 .",

    "perhaps , still more severe changes are required .",
    "finally , it should be said that the calculation discussed in chapter 4 should merely be understood as a first ( naive ) attempt to extract information out of the functional integral equation for the complete effective action by means of a simple approximation which however admits mostly analytical investigation .",

    "however , the criticism spelled out in section 2.3 with respect to the artificial distinction between classical action and effective action also applies to this view on the space - time structure .",
    "therefore , more adequate the structure of space - time should be understood as some characteristics of the quantum field theoretic vacuum .",

    "the point is that only one situation can be considered as the one where normalization is performed ( and we typically choose free minkowski space as reference situation and the signal velocity of light there as reference standard , although of course also any less symmetrical set - up could be used ) .",
    "but , in view of the discussion performed in section 2.3 it makes no sense to consider any normalized value of a certain quantity ( mass , charge , velocity of light , e.g. ) as classical because this is a concept not accessible to experiment .",
    "we can only denote certain values defined by a certain measurement scenario under defined circumstances as reference values .",
    "any changes of these values measured under different circumstances are certainly of quantum nature but equally well these values could have served as initial reference values .",
    "consequently , it appears most sensible to consider these quantities from the very beginning as characteristics of the quantum field theoretic vacuum and their changes as parameterizing changes of it with respect to some reference situation . + summarizing the concept proposed in the present article let us point out that it proposes a view on quantum field theory which differs from the established one , but the established standard paradigm finds it natural explanation and place within this new approach .",
    "in particular , it incorporates and continues in modified shape certain ideas used in local renormalizable quantum field theory such as the unobservability of bare quantities and the hypothesis that the vanishing of the beta function(s ) ( corresponding to a fixed point of the renormalization group ) defines the physical coupling constant(s ) of a model . the functional integral equation for the complete effective action proposed ensures ( merely by definition ) that any of its solutions is finite ( it is not a solution , otherwise . ) .",
    "this removes to a certain extent the concern of divergencies standard quantum field theory is beset by , but the price to pay for this is the present uncertainty whether the functional integral equation proposed has beyond free field theories any other nontrivial solution ( i.e. , any nonlinear ( interacting ) field theory ) .",
    "the most natural place to find out whether the proposed concept is physically correct should be qed because unlike some other model theories it is a theory for phenomena definitely present in nature .",
    "qed is certainly structurally more complex than scalar model field theories , e.g. , but if for qed something new can be learned we may feel sure that our physical understanding has advanced .",
    "the approximative approach to the functional integral equation for the qed effective action presented has proved its calculational accessibility .",
    "although the particular approximation studied is still quite simple it has yielded certain nonperturbative information what indicates that the present approach also has certain calculational advantages .",
    "however , only further investigation will show whether any obviously appropriate approximation can be found which yields with reasonable calculational effort the correct value of the fine structure constant . in a certain sense",
    "this should be viewed as a crucial test because in principle the present approach if really physically correct and adequate should be able to pass it .",
