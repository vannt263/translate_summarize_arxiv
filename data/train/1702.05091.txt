    "cosmic rays originating in our heliospheric environment , and the galactic cosmic rays affected by the heliospheric plasma , are an interesting and cosmic ray population to study : we can observe not only the particles , but often also directly or indirectly the properties of the particle sources and the turbulent plasmas the particles propagate in .",
    "thus , by studying the solar and heliospheric cosmic rays , we can improve our knowledge of the fundamental processed responsible for cosmic ray acceleration and transport in plasma environments in general . in this way , the heliosphere is our local laboratory for delving into the the physics of the cosmic rays .",
    "the heliospheric cosmic ray research has also a practical application : the cosmic rays represent a space weather hazard to humans and technology at earth and in space .",
    "for this reason , the cosmic ray research has also entered national and international awareness as significant risk for humans .    as any scientific research topic",
    ", the heliospheric cosmic ray research requires experiments to observe the particles . due to the earth s magnetic field ,",
    "large part of the energy range of interest for heliospheric particles precludes the use of instruments at the surface of the earth , thus the research requires instrumentation that is attached to spacecraft .",
    "therefore , the advance of the research area depends on the availability of current , and the outlook of the future scientific space missions , and the planned instrumentation .    the purpose of this overview is to outline the current status of the heliospheric cosmic ray instrumentation .",
    "we will first outline in section  [ sec : solar - heli - cosm ] the main research topics in the heliospheric cosmic rays .",
    "we then will present the current status of the instrumentation in section  [ sec : current - fleet ] , and discuss the future instrumentation in section  [ sec : future - missions ] .",
    "the sources of the heliospheric cosmic rays observed in the heliosphere can be classified into three categories : the solar cosmic rays , or solar energetic particles ( seps ) ; interplanetary cosmic rays ; and particles originating from outside our heliosphere .",
    "a full review of these categories is beyond the scope of this overview , we will only briefly outline these categories below .",
    "the seps originate at the sun and its vicinity , related to the activity of the sun , and are observed during and after violent magnetic eruptions at the sun .",
    "the sep signatures are seen indirectly in x - rays and gamma rays at the sun , and as radio bursts in the corona and in the interplanetary space  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the particles also escape from the sun , and are observed with in situ instruments throughout the heliosphere , and , in the high - energy ground level enhancement ( gle ) events , also within the earth s atmosphere , by neutron monitors , at the surface of the earth  @xcite .",
    "the seps have been considered to originate at two acceleration locations : solar flares , which can have field - aligned electric fields , strong turbulence and internal shock waves ; and coronal and interplanetary shock waves that have been considered as blast waves and waves driven by the mass ejected during the eruption , the coronal mass ejection ( cme )  @xcite .",
    "a two - class paradigm has been considered related to the two acceleration schemes , and the differences in particle abundances and flare and radio signatures in the so - called impulsive and gradual events @xcite . in the classification ,",
    "the impulsive events are rich in heavy ions , and the acceleration takes place in the narrow flare region , whereas the proton - rich gradual events are due to wide shock waves driven by the cmes .",
    "recently , the two - class paradigm has been challenged with evidence suggesting that the division to the two classes is not clear @xcite .",
    "in addition , the very wide sep events analysed by multiple spacecraft show that the heavy ions , traditionally related to impulsive events , can have a wide access to a wide longitudinal ranges @xcite , which seems to contradict the idea of acceleration at small flare region .",
    "the questions around the two - class paradigm are currently unsolved , and subject of continuing research",
    ".    particles are also accelerated in the interplanetary space , further away from sun .",
    "some coronal mass ejection driven shock waves are capable of accelerating particles as they propagate throughout the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "such cmes offer a possibility to observe the acceleration region directly , in situ .",
    "particle acceleration can also take place in the corotating interaction regions ( cirs ) , where fast solar wind stream overtakes a slower solar wind , which , in the parker spiral geometry , results in an interaction region between the two solar wind streams  @xcite . at distances beyond 1  au from the sun ,",
    "the boundaries of the interaction region form a pair of shocks , which can accelerate particles to mev energies @xcite .",
    "planetary magnetospheres , and their bow shocks , are also capable of accelerating charged particles . while the planetary particle research is outside the scope of this overview , the particles escaping from the planetary acceleration processes into the interplanetary medium are of interest to the cosmic ray community .",
    "in particular , the jovian electrons , accelerated at jupiter @xcite , which represents a steady - state point source in the heliosphere , have been used to probe the models of cosmic ray propagation in the heliosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "particles are also accelerated at the outer boundaries of the heliosphere .",
    "the anomalous cosmic rays ( acr ) , first observed in 1973 , are an anomalous component in the spectra of some heavy ion species , as observed during solar activity minima @xcite .",
    "the acr have been considered as pickup ions accelerated at the termination shock @xcite .",
    "however , the recent observations by the voyager spacecraft have cast doubt to this view @xcite .    finally , the cosmic rays that originate outside our heliosphere are also important for the heliospheric cosmic ray research .",
    "the galactic cosmic rays are modulated by the interplanetary turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which gives information on the properties of the interplanetary turbulence , the particle transport within the turbulence , and the source spectrum of the particles outside the heliosphere .",
    "the voyager 1 is now measuring the interstellar spectrum @xcite , thus the modulated observations in the inner heliosphere can be used to improve our understanding of the state of the interplanetary turbulence , and the physics behind the particle transport in such turbulent fields .",
    "in this section , we will investigate our current abilities to measure the cosmic ray fluxes at different energies to study the different heliospheric cosmic ray sources .",
    "we will start our search from the surface of the earth , reaching to outside the heliosphere .",
    "the mission and instrument details are collected in table  [ tab : currfleet ] ."
