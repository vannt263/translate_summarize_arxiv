    "during the last few years impressive progress was made in the experimental investigation of ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices.@xcite it is now possible to measure not only density profiles and static correlation functions but even dynamical quantities such as spectral functions of the trapped particles , using bragg spectroscopy.@xcite thereby momentum resolved bosonic spectral functions were obtained in the case of condensed bosons@xcite and across the phase transition to a mott insulator.@xcite by contrast , only rather few calculations of bosonic spectral functions have been performed so far for the bose - hubbard model .",
    "early studies were based on the strong - coupling approximation to the bose - hubbard model.@xcite later the weak - coupling limit at zero temperature was thoroughly analyzed with the functional renormalization group.@xcite other approaches include the variational cluster approximation,@xcite which was used to investigate systems in one@xcite and two@xcite dimensions , the quantum rotor approximation,@xcite which was recently applied to three - dimensional systems,@xcite and the linked - cluster expansion ( lce).@xcite in particular the lce , which was employed to approximately solve the equations of the bosonic dynamical mean - field theory ( b - dmft),@xcite allows one to study the bose - hubbard model for strong interactions and near the phase boundary between the superfluid and the mott - insulating phase .",
    "the b - dmft treats local correlations in time exactly and includes spatial correlations on the mean - field level .",
    "it is applicable for all values of the hubbard interaction , density and temperature .",
    "the b - dmft was derived subsequent to the dmft for lattice fermions@xcite and was applied to various bosonic problems@xcite as well as to mixtures@xcite of bosons and fermions .",
    "it has been extended and applied also to inhomogeneous situations@xcite and to bosonic systems in non - equilibrium@xcite .    in this paper we solve the bose - hubbard model within the b - dmft framework on a simple cubic lattice in three dimensions using a continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) solver.@xcite this approach is known to give excellent results for the phase diagram and static properties@xcite of interacting bosons .",
    "we compute the momentum resolved and the momentum integrated spectral functions and the dispersion relation of interacting bosons in , both , the superfluid and the mott insulating phase .",
    "the following questions will be addressed and answered : ( i ) how well can strong - coupling approaches , which are known to capture the phase diagram of correlated bosons very well , describe dynamical properties such as spectral functions ? ( ii )",
    "how does the presence of the superfluid influence the spectral properties of normal bosons ? ( iii )",
    "how is the dispersion relation modified by the interaction ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect2 ] we introduce the bose - hubbard model and recapitulate the main steps of the b - dmft framework .",
    "we also introduce an improved method for calculating the self - energy which makes use of two - particle green functions and discuss the method for the numerical analytic continuation .",
    "in section [ sect3 ] we present the results for the momentum resolved spectral function in the limit of weak , intermediate , and strong interactions , respectively . finally , section [ sect4 ] concludes the paper with a summary .",
    "we consider spinless bosons on a lattice described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is a bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator on a lattice site @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the chemical potential , @xmath5 is the local interaction strength , and @xmath6 is the hopping amplitude .",
    "we assume nearest neighbour ( nn ) hopping , i.e. , @xmath7 if sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 are nn and @xmath10 otherwise .",
    "our calculations were performed for a simple cubic lattice with coordination number @xmath11 and @xmath12 in arbitrary units .      in the b - dmft",
    "the lattice problem is replaced by a single - site ( `` impurity '' ) problem with self - consistency conditions .",
    "a detailed derivation can be found in ref . .",
    "the impurity action reads @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the inverse of the temperature @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a geometrical parameter depending on a lattice type , and @xmath17 is the imaginary ( matsubara ) time .",
    "we use the nambu vector notation for operators @xmath18 and complex variables @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 then the connected green functions are defined by @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the equilibrium average in the grand canonical ensemble , and @xmath23.@xcite the last two terms in eq . represent the coupling of the site to two types of external mean - fields : ( i ) the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) which is represented by a static mean - field @xmath24 , and ( ii ) the dynamical mean - field of normal bosons represented by the matrix @xmath25 , the elements of which are hybridization functions .",
    "the hybridization functions are related to the green functions @xmath26 for a lattice with a cavity at site @xmath10 ( i.e. , where site @xmath10 is removed ) by@xcite @xmath27 similarly , the condensate field @xmath24 for a lattice with a cavity at site @xmath10 reads @xmath28 the connection between the condensate field on a full lattice , @xmath29 , and the condensate field on a lattice with a cavity , @xmath24 , is expressed by @xmath30\\mathbf{\\phi}.\\ ] ]    once the mean fields @xmath24 and @xmath31 are known it is possible to solve the impurity problem and calculate the local green functions and local condensate fields .",
    "this can be achieved by exact diagonalization@xcite , the lce approximation@xcite , or ct - qmc.@xcite in this paper we use the ct - qmc method to solve the impurity problem .",
    "our code is based on the work of anders _ _ et al.__@xcite we employ an improved calculation of the self - energy via two - particle green functions , to be discussed in section [ imp_se ] and in the appendix .",
    "tests of our code show numerical agreement with the results of ref . .",
    "once the single - particle green functions have been obtained by solving the single - site problem , the local self - energy can be calculated from the dyson equation @xmath32^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 are even matsubara frequencies for bosons ( @xmath34 ) . in the b - dmft",
    "the self - energies are local , i.e. , momentum independent .",
    "the momentum resolved green functions are then given by @xmath35^{-1 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the dispersion relation for noninteracting bosons . to close the self - consistency equations we calculate the local green functions from the @xmath37-integrated dyson equation @xmath38^{-1 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the noninteracting density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the self - energies can be calculated by solving the single - impurity model with the ct - qmc method and then using eq .  .",
    "however , this calculation is subject to stochastic uncertainties at high positive and negative frequencies for the following reason : in the first step the impurity problem is solved with the ct - qmc from which one obtains the green function @xmath40 , which has the form @xmath41 for large @xmath42 . the numerical error of this result is almost independent of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore relative error grows linearly with @xmath33 . in the second step",
    "the green function is inverted and substituted into eq .  .",
    "the linear term cancels out , and only terms of the order of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and smaller remain .",
    "this results in a progressively larger relative error , i.e. , the error increases quadratically with frequency @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "[ self_energy ] ) .    to improve the accuracy of the calculation of the self - energies we adapt the method proposed by snoek and hofstetter,@xcite and use the two - particle green functions .",
    "the strategy goes as follows : finding equations for the self - energies requires solving the equations of motion for the green functions in the bosonic single - impurity model .",
    "this is similar to the method proposed for fermions.@xcite the final expression for the self - energy reads @xmath45 \\mathbb{g}^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the fourier transform of a matrix of two - particle , _ disconnected _ green functions @xmath47 given by @xmath48(\\tau ) \\hat{b}^{\\dag}(0 ) & [ \\hat{b}^{\\dag } \\hat{b } \\hat{b}](\\tau ) \\hat{b}(0 ) \\\\ [ \\hat{b}^{\\dag } \\hat{b}^{\\dag } \\hat{b}](\\tau ) \\hat{b}^{\\dag}(0 ) & [ \\hat{b}^{\\dag } \\hat{b}^{\\dag } \\hat{b}](\\tau ) \\hat{b}(0 ) \\end{pmatrix}\\bigg\\rangle.\\ ] ] details of this derivation are presented in appendix  [ appa ] . in fig .",
    "[ self_energy ] we see that the improved method significantly reduces the error , i.e. , it now grows only linearly in frequency .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to calculate the momentum resolved spectral function @xmath49 and the momentum integrated spectral function @xmath50 , respectively , of the bose - hubbard model  . from the ct - qmc impurity solver",
    "we obtain the green functions and the self - energies in imaginary time or in matsubara frequencies . since these functions are analytic in the upper complex plane we can analytically continue them to the real axis .",
    "this involves an inversion of the hilbert transform : @xmath51 or @xmath52 it is well - known that this is a numerically ill - posed problem , in particular for noisy data obtained with ct - qmc . to make the analytic continuation tractable we use the maximum entropy ( maxent )",
    "method.@xcite we found that the maxent procedure sometimes fails to converge , especially in calculations of sharply peaked momentum resolved spectral functions @xmath49 . in these cases",
    "we use the _ historic _ rather than the _ bryan _ version of maxent .",
    "in the following we present results for spectral functions of the bose - hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice for weak , intermediate , and strong interaction strengths . for illustration",
    "we indicate the sets of parameters at which the calculations for strong and intermediate coupling , respectively , were performed in the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] ) .",
    "the diagram was calculated within the static fisher mean - field theory @xcite and the b - dmft,@xcite which was solved by ct - qmc@xcite and lce.@xcite      our results in the weak interaction limit were obtained for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . for these parameters the average occupation per site is @xmath56 and the average number of condensed bosons per site is @xmath57 . since @xmath58 is small in comparison to the bandwidth @xmath59 , the weak - coupling bogoliubov approximation@xcite can be expected to be applicable .",
    "the momentum resolved spectral function @xmath49 obtained within the b - dmft is presented in fig .",
    "[ spectr_weak]a .",
    "there are two bands : with positive energies for particle addition and with negative energies for particle removal .",
    "most of the spectral weight is concentrated in the upper band .",
    "the widths of the peaks for specific @xmath37-points represent the mean lifetime of the quasiparticles .",
    "the weight of the lower band is orders of magnitude smaller , and therefore its exact shape and position is not determined reliably by maxent .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath60 , obtained from @xmath49 according to the definition @xmath61 is shown in fig .",
    "[ spectr_weak]b .",
    "the dispersion relation obtained from the bogoliubov approximation is found to be in very good agreement with the b - dmft result , except near the @xmath62 point , where the b - dmft dispersion does not go to zero .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the hugenholtz - pines theorem@xcite is not fulfilled in the b - dmft as already reported by anders _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite      calculations in the limit of strong interactions were performed for @xmath53 , and @xmath63 . in fig .",
    "[ spectr_scl ] we present the spectral function @xmath49 for the mott insulating phase at @xmath64 and the superfluid phase at @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] ) .",
    "a striking difference between the spectra in the mott insulating and superfluid phases , respectively , is the number of bands and their width at specific @xmath37-points .    in the mott insulating phase",
    "there are two bands , separated by a gap whose width is approximately given by @xmath66 .",
    "this value becomes exact in the atomic limit ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath68 corresponds to the sum of half - widths of the upper and lower bands .",
    "the shape of this dispersion relation is almost the same as that for a noninteracting band . in the mott insulating phase with average occupation @xmath69 one particle",
    "is frozen on every lattice site such that an extra particle or hole can move almost freely through the system .",
    "since the energy for creating an excitation is large , the density of excitations is very low , and therefore one can neglect their interaction . as a result quasiparticle and quasihole excitations",
    "behave almost like noninteracting particles , i.e. , have almost noninteracting dispersion relations .",
    "the width of the peaks is therefore small , implying that the mean lifetime is large .",
    "in fact , we checked that the width corresponds to the uncertainty of the analytic continuation rather than to the mean lifetime .",
    "the bandwidth of particle excitations is wider than that of hole excitations by approximately @xmath70 . in the strong interaction limit",
    "the bandwidths of the hole and particle excitations in the mott insulating phase with integer filling @xmath71 are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "this is a quantum effect related to particle indistinguishability , which is simple to derive by starting with a state in which each site is occupied by @xmath74 particles and treating the hopping term in the hamiltonian   as a small perturbation .    in the superfluid phase",
    "this is no longer valid . as the chemical potential increases , the energy for creating particle excitations decreases",
    "therefore the interaction between the quasiparticles needs to be taken into account .",
    "indeed the spectrum of the superfluid is significantly different from that in the mott insulating phase .",
    "in particular , we find four rather than two bands .",
    "only the positions of the three lowest bands are determined reliably by maxent .",
    "the four bands arise from two processes : ( i ) the splitting of a single band due to the interaction , similar to the mott insulating phase ; ( ii ) the creation of bogoliubov quasiparticles due to the mixing of particle and hole excitations .",
    "we checked that , in contrast to the mott insulating phase , the width of the peaks for small @xmath75 is robust with respect to maxent parameters as well as re - sampling and therefore represents the mean lifetime of quasiparticles and not the accuracy of analytic continuation .    in fig .",
    "[ disprel_scl ] we show the dispersion relations @xmath60 obtained within the b - dmft scheme according to eq . .",
    "we compare them with the dispersion relations obtained from the self - energies calculated within the static fisher mean - field approximation.@xcite the results of both methods are in good agreement in the mott insulating phase ( fig .",
    "[ disprel_scl ] , top panel ) .    in the superfluid phase ( fig .",
    "[ disprel_scl ] , bottom panel ) this comparison is presented for the three dominant bands .",
    "the results are also in good agreement with the static fisher mean - field results . in both approaches",
    "the high - energy ( negative ) band is similar to the band of a noninteracting hole .",
    "the remaining two dispersions are linear for small values of @xmath76 in the fisher mean - field theory and correspond to massless bogoliubov quasiparticles . in the b - dmft",
    "we also see the linear behaviour except for the vicinity of the @xmath62-point .",
    "the dispersion relation around @xmath77 does not go to zero , since the hugenholtz - pines theorem is not obeyed in the b - dmft ( see also section  [ non_lim ] ) .",
    "the slight deviation of the ct - qmc result from that of the static fisher mean - field theory@xcite in the middle of the band around the r point is attributed to the finite resolution of maxent .",
    "the most interesting regime is that of intermediate interactions where both the bogoliubov approximation and the static fisher mean - field theory@xcite are no longer valid .",
    "we computed the spectral functions in this regime within b - dmft and compare our ct - qmc results with those obtained within the lce@xcite .",
    "we used the same set of parameters as in ref .",
    ", i.e. , each set corresponds to a point in a \\{@xmath78 } parameter space for @xmath79 .",
    "the selected points allow us to study the evolution of the spectral functions through the phase transition . here",
    "we consider the phase transitions driven by the change of the interaction and by the change of the chemical potential ( fig  [ phase_diag ] , left and right panel , respectively ) . in fig.[lce_ctqmc ] we present the b - dmft results and compare with the lce .",
    "there is good agreement regarding the widths and the positions of the bands in the superfluid phase .",
    "however , in the mott insulating phase the lce spectral functions develop a two - peak structure for both positive nad negative energies .",
    "this is not supported by the ct - qmc results .",
    "the origin of this feature in the lce may be an overfitting of the numerical analytic continuation , since in the lce the error is small but unknown .",
    "we now focus on the momentum dependence of the spectral functions and the dispersion relations for the mott insulating and superfluid phases ( figs .",
    "[ ak ] ,  [ disprel_int ] ) .",
    "the most striking feature is the difference of the width of the peaks for specific @xmath37-points in these two phases .",
    "deep in the mott insulating phase the width represents the uncertainty of the maxent fit .",
    "this is not the case in the superfluid phase in which the width represents the mean lifetime of quasiparticles .",
    "effectively , deep in the insulating phase we can describe the particles as almost free , whereas approaching the phase transition the quasiparticles obtain a mean lifetime . in the superfluid phase we observe high - energy excitations , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ ak]c , resembling a structure found in the strong - coupling regime . within the accuracy of our method a more precise calculation of their position is not possible .",
    "the dispersion relations shown in fig.[disprel_int ] are compared with the strong - coupling dispersions obtained for @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in the mott insulating phase",
    "the gap obtained by the static fisher mean - field theory@xcite is much smaller than in the b - dmft .",
    "thereby the phase transition is shifted to larger interactions , see fig  [ phase_diag ] . in the superfluid phase",
    "we observe that , in contrast to the weak and strong - coupling limits , the dispersion relation obtained at intermediate coupling within the b - dmft is not symmetric with respect to zero energy .",
    ", which leads to a symmetric dispersion relation . ]    in fig .",
    "[ spectr_weak_u10 ] we present the results obtained in the dilute gas regime .",
    "the parameters are @xmath53 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath84 and @xmath85 . as in the previous cases ( superfluid phase )",
    "we observe that the peaks in the spectral function are wide , which means that the mean lifetime of excitations is finite .",
    "the negative energy band has a weight which is orders of magnitude smaller , and therefore its exact shape and position is again not determined reliably by our method of analytic continuation .",
    "the results at the @xmath62-point are not included , since maxent failed to converge for very small @xmath37 .",
    "although the particle density is low and the majority of the particles constitute the condensate , the interaction is not weak .",
    "therefore one is not in the parameter range where the bogoliubov approximation is applicable . indeed , as seen in fig .",
    "[ spectr_weak_u10]b , the dispersion relation is not reproduced by this approximation .",
    "a similar discrepancy was reported in the experiment@xcite , where at high momenta the bogoliubov approximation was found to overestimate the measured excitation energy .",
    "a further effect of the interaction is the appearance of an additional band at high energies , fig .",
    "[ spectr_weak_u10]a .",
    "this high energy band appears to repel the one with low energies . as a result",
    "the low energy band is narrower .",
    "this explains the discrepancy between the b - dmft and the bogoliubov results , since the high energy band is absent in the latter .",
    "we presented a computational method which allows one to calculate spectral functions for bosonic systems described with the bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "this approach has the great advantage of being applicable for arbitrary values of @xmath86 , the ratio of the interaction strength and the hopping amplitude .",
    "it reproduces well the results in the limiting cases of large and small values of the interaction .",
    "results obtained by this method were shown for parameters where perturbative methods fail , thus providing new insights into the properties of correlated lattice bosons in previously inaccessible parameter ranges .",
    "the results show that while in the insulating phase particle and hole excitations tend to behave like free particles , in the superfluid phase the system is described by bogoliubov quasiparticles with a finite mean lifetime . finally , we discussed an alternative method for calculating the local self - energy in the ct - qmc solver which employs two - particle green functions , and which produces accurate data at large matsubara frequencies .",
