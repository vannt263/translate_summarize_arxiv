    "localized excitation in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) has become one of the most interesting topics in nonlinear lattice systems since the discrete breathers ( dbs ) and the intrinsic localized modes are discovered @xcite .",
    "the most well - known fascinating feature of the localized mode is that it can propagate without changing its shape as a result of the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion @xcite .",
    "db arises intrinsically from the interplay between the nonlinearity and the discreteness of the system .",
    "db has been observed in various systems , such as micromechanical cantilever arrays @xcite , antiferromagnet systems @xcite , josephson - junction arrays @xcite , nonlinear waveguide arrays @xcite , becs @xcite , tonks gas @xcite , superfluid fermi gases @xcite , and some dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "the static , dynamical , and other properties of db have been studied theoretically in the last decade @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that dbs are attractors in dissipative systems @xcite , or act as virtual bottlenecks which slow down the relaxation processes in generic nonlinear lattices @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the stability of the discrete localized modes plays a crucial role in blocking , filtering , and transfer of the norm through a localized mode . by far",
    ", there are many interesting works focused on this stability by considering two - body interactions @xcite .",
    "recently , the three - body interactions could be observed or realized in experiment and theory @xcite . in 2014 ,",
    "petrov @xcite proposed a method to control the two- and three - body interactions in ultracold bose gas in any dimension .",
    "the three - body interactions play an important role in many interesting physical phenomena @xcite , and even lead to a variety of unique properties that are absent in the system dominated by the two - body interactions which can be governed by a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "for example , in 2010 , dasgupta @xcite discovered that if the two - body interactions are attractive , the presence of three - body interactions makes the crossover process from bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) to bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) a nonreversible one . in 2012 , singh _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found that the coupling of the two- and three - body interactions can affect strongly the transition from mott insulator to superfluid for ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice or a superlattice .",
    "up to now , there are few works on localized excitations in nonlinear lattice systems by considering three - body interactions .",
    "especially , there are no systematical analysis of the types , existence , and stability of the localized modes , such as db , the discrete kink ( dk ) @xcite , and multi - breather ( mub ) .",
    "it is natural to ask how the two- and three - body interactions affect these properties of the localized modes in becs .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the stability and phase transition of localized modes in becs in an optical lattice with a discrete nonlinear schrdinger model ( dnls ) in the case by considering both two- and three - body interactions .",
    "we find that there are three different types of localized modes , that is , db , dk , and mub , and give the critical conditions for these localized modes .",
    "both the two- and three - body on - site repulsive interactions can stabilize db , while the three - body on - site attractive interactions destabilize it .",
    "we calculate analytically the energy thresholds , the peierls - nabarro ( pn ) energy barrier @xcite , characterizing the stability of the localized excitation modes .",
    "if the total energy of the system is higher ( lower ) than the thresholds , the localized states are unstable ( stable ) . moreover , the stability and dynamics characters of db and mub are general for extended lattice systems .",
    "our result is important for the transfer of becs through the discrete localized modes , and is useful for controlling the transmission of matter waves in interferometry and quantum - information processes when there are both two- and three - body interactions in the system .",
    "besides the on - site two - body interactions , let us investigate the effect on transfer of becs through discrete localized mode from the on - site three - body interactions of ultracold bose gas in an optical lattice . under the mean - field theory , the hamiltonian of the system of becs in an optical lattice can be written as @xcite : @xmath0 here @xmath1 @xmath2 is the index of the site .",
    "@xmath3 is a complex variable and @xmath4 is the mean number of bosons at site @xmath1 ( i.e. , the norm @xmath5 ) .",
