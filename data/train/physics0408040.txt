    "external fields are nowadays widely used to control the motion of atoms including their cooling and trapping as well as the preparation of their internal states .",
    "optical lattices and atom chips are two major examples of devices that allow to deal with atomic ensembles but also possess the perspective of manipulating single atoms for the purpose of quantum information processing . to this end",
    "it is indispensable to understand the structure and behaviour of ( excited ) individual atoms in traps . in the case of the atom chip",
    "( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) tight magnetic traps on the micrometer scale can be created exhibiting large field gradients which are not accessible in the case of macrosopic traps .",
    "highly excited rydberg atoms therefore start to feel the variation i.e. the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field across the extension of their wave functions .",
    "this naturally leads to the question : how do inhomogeneous magnetic field configurations alter the electronic structure of excited atoms ?    during the past decades",
    "many thorough investigations have been performed on the behaviour and properties of excited ( rydberg- ) atoms in homogeneous magnetic fields ( see the books and reviews @xcite ) .",
    "indeed investigations on atoms in strong magnetic fields provided major contributions to a variety of different research areas such as semiclassics of nonintegrable systems , quantum chaos , nonlinear dynamics , astrophysics of magnetized stars and it elucidated and significantly advanced our understanding of magnetized structures in general .",
    "in contrast to the case of a homogeneous magnetic field there exist no studies on the electronic structure of atoms in the presence of inhomogeneous external fields : all investigations in the literature on the behaviour of ultracold atoms in inhomogeneous fields typically treat the atom as a point particle whose magnetic moment couples either adiabatically @xcite or nonadiabatically @xcite to the external field .",
    "this holds with the exception of two very recent works @xcite that consider the electronic structure of atoms with a single active electron subject to a three - dimensional quadrupole field .",
    "a variety of interesting new phenomena have been observed there .",
    "the symmetries of this system cause each energy level to be degenerate in the presence of the field .",
    "furthermore the intimate coupling of the spin and spatial degrees of freedom leads to a complex spatial distribution of the spin polarization of individual electronic states .",
    "a remarkable property of the electronic states in the 3d - quadrupole trap is the fact that they possess a magnetic field - induced permanent electric dipole moment whose size strongly varies with the rydberg state considered . besides the 3d - quadrupole field",
    "there is another generic inhomogeneous magnetic field configuration which is employed to trap atoms in particular on the atom chip @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called side guide which is created by superimposing the magnetic field of a current carrying wire with a homogeneous bias field oriented perpendicular to the wire .",
    "the resulting magnetic guide can be augmented to a ioffe - pritchard type 2d - trap by applying an additional homogeneous bias field parallel to the wire .",
    "it is exactly this configuration which is studied in the present work i.e. we investigate the structure and properties of electronically excited atoms in a magnetic guide . according to the effects obtained for atoms in a 3d - quadrupole trap in refs .",
    "@xcite we expect also the atoms in a side guide to exhibit interesting new features .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] we introduce the field configuration generated by a so - called side guide .",
    "we specify our approach which is particularly suited for ultra - cold atoms with a single active electron and derive the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian exhibits a wealth of both unitary and anti - unitary symmetries and constitutes an uncommon large symmetry group which is analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : symmetries ] .",
    "in particular these symmetries lead to a two - fold degeneracy of any energy level , similar to the case of an atom in a 3d - quadrupole trap .",
    "a discussion of an arbitrary spin-@xmath0-systems in a field configuration obeying certain symmetries are discussed .",
    "section [ sec : eigenstates ] contains a discussion of the properties of the symmetry - adapted electronic states . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ioffe ] the latter are studied in case an additional homogeneous ( ioffe-)field is applied .",
    "the numerical methods being employed in order to solve the stationary schrdinger equation are briefly outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] .",
    "a discussion of our results is provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we analyze the spectra for a wide range of gradients .",
    "furthermore we explore properties of the electronic spin such as spin expectation values and distributions of the spin polarization .",
    "selection rules and dipole strengths of electric dipole transitions are calculated .",
    "we close with a discussion of the electronic structure in case a homogeneous magnetic field is applied in addition to the field of the magnetic guide .",
    "[ sec : outlook ] contains the summary and outlook .",
    "alkali atoms are used throughout many experiments in ultra cold atomic physics . besides a single active electron they possess a closed shell core and the total electronic spin",
    "is therefore exclusively carried by the outer electron .",
    "we assume the motion of this valence electron to take place in the coulomb potential of a single positive point charge .",
    "since the focus of this work is to understand fundamental features of electronically excited atoms in a certain inhomogeneous magnetic field we do not account for quantum defects which would require the consideration of core - electron scattering processes .",
    "we also neglect relativistic effects such as spin - orbit and hyperfine coupling .",
    "both interaction possess a @xmath1-dependence with @xmath2 being the distance between the outer electron and the nucleus . for ( highly ) excited states their contributions can safely be neglected or , if necessary accounted for by means of perturbation theory .",
    "since we focus on ultra cold atoms effects of the center of mass ( c.m . ) motion on the electronic motion are neglected here .",
    "specifically we assume an infinitely heavy core ( c.m . ) located at the minimum of the magnetic field . employing the above approximations the hamiltonian describing the motion of the valence electron in the presence of an external magnetic field reads @xmath3 the magnetic field",
    "is introduced via the minimal coupling including the vector potential thereby providing the kinetic energy in the presence of the field .",
    "the third term represents the coupling between the spin of the electron and the external field .",
    "a common configuration for the manipulation of neutral atoms is the so - called magnetic side guide @xcite .",
    "this particular setup is generated by a current carrying wire whose circular magnetic field is superimposed by an external homogeneous bias field perpendicular to the current flow . as a result the field vanishes along a line parallel to the wire at a distance @xmath4 being completely determined by the current @xmath5 and the homogeneous magnetic field strength @xmath6 .",
    "the taylor expansion of the field around @xmath7 yields @xmath8 these are the quadrupolar , hexapolar and octopolar expansion terms of the field . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the linear term which should provide a good approximation of the magnetic field configuration as long as @xmath9 .",
    "thus we obtain the expression @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the magnetic field gradient determining the linear growth of the field with increasing distance from the line of zero field .",

    "a corresponding vector potential in the coulomb gauge is given by @xmath16 inserting the expressions ( [ eq : magnetic_field ] ) and ( [ eq : vector_potential ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_general ] ) thereby adopting atomic units , @xmath17 , @xmath18 : the magnetic gradient unit then becomes @xmath19 .",
    "the magnetic field strength unit is @xmath20 yields @xmath21 the first two terms of ( [ eq : hamiltonian_cart ] ) represent the non - relativistic hydrogen atom .",

    "the spatial coordinates in @xmath22 and @xmath23 couple with the momentum in @xmath14 direction .",
    "the successive diamagnetic term @xmath24 represents an oscillator coupling term confining the electronic motion in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 direction except for the axis exit channels .",
    "this is reminiscent but also very different to the situation in a homogeneous field , where the diamagnetic interactions in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 direction separate and represent pure harmonic oscillators .",
    "finally the fifth term represents the coupling of the electronic spin to the spatial coordinates arises from the interaction of its magnetic moment with the field .",
    "we here encounter a linear dependence on the spatial coordinates and the gradient @xmath11 .",
    "this term prevents the factorization of the motions in coordinate space and spin space .",
    "finally one should note that the only explicit dependence on the coordinate @xmath14 is due to the coulomb term . without this rotationally invariant interaction",
    "the system would be invariant under translations with respect to the @xmath14-coordinate .    performing the canonical scaling transformation @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath26 the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_cart ] ) becomes @xmath27 with @xmath28 and where we have for simplicity omitted the bar on top of the phase space variables .",
    "this shows us that employing a scaled energy ( scaled hamiltonian ) the only free parameter is the scaled coulomb coupling strength @xmath29 that depends on the field gradient .",
    "the scaled hamiltonian describes the motion of an electron in the coulomb - field of a charge @xmath29 and the field with gradient @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath31 the coulomb term vanishes since @xmath32 . in this limit",
    "the energy level spacing is expected to scale according to @xmath33 .",
    "in this section we analyze the structure of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_cart ] ) in detail . after studying its symmetries",
    "we discuss how these symmetries affect the excitation spectrum . as a result of a tedious and elaborate analysis of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_cart ] ) we found 15 distinct symmetry operations leaving it invariant .",
    "a complete list is provided in table [ tbl : symmetries ] .",

    "bottom part : anti - unitary symmetries . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     due to the presence of the additional homogeneous field numerous symmetries are lost ( see table [ tbl : symmetries ] for comparison ) .",
    "the remaining operations form a non - abelian algebra .",
    "in contrast to the group operations listed in table [ tbl : symmetries ] there are no two anti - commuting operators . hence it is not possible to construct pairs of degenerate energy eigenstates as discussed above .",
    "thus , applying the ioffe field lifts the degeneracies occuring in the absence of it .",
    "even with a finite ioffe field the operations @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 together with @xmath37 form a set of commuting operators .",
    "in order to obtain many eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hamiltonians ( [ eq : hamiltonian_cart ] ) and ( [ eq : hamiltonian_ioffe_cart ] ) particularly for highly excited rydberg states we adopt the linear variational principle . here the bound state solutions of the schrdinger equation are expanded in a finite set of square integrable basis functions .",
    "determining the expansion coefficients is equivalent to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem in case of non - orthogonal basis functions .",
    "the latter is done numerically by employing standard linear algebra techniques and routines .    to accomplish the above we adopt spherical coordinates .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_cart ] ) then becomes @xmath38 with an additional ioffe applied we have to consider the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_ioffe_cart ] ) which reads in spherical coordinates @xmath39 we utilize a sturmian basis set of the form @xmath40 these functions form a complete set in real and spin space but are not orthogonal .",

    "the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be adapted in order to gain an optimal convergence behavior in any spectral region .",
    "in particular the non - linear variational parameter @xmath47 has to adapted such that it corresponds to the inverse of the characteristic length scale of the desired wavefunctions .",

    "the linear variational principle has been used to solve the stationary schrdinger equation : employing a sturmian basis set enabled us to converge a large number of eigenfunctions .    a careful inspection of the hamiltonian yields an amazingly large number of symmetries involving both the spin and spatial degrees of freedom : we have found 15 symmetry operations of both unitary and anti - unitary character .",
