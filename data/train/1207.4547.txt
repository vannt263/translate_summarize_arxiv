    "in the last three decades , a new class of quantum phases which are described by topological field theory has attracted much interest .",
    "the topological structure is reflected in the existence of gapless edge states and in characteristic magnetoelectric responses .",
    "the first example was an integer quantum hall phase , which is characterized by the thouless - kohmoto - nightingale - de nijs ( tknn ) number and shows the quantized hall conductivity in an applied magnetic field.@xcite furthermore , in this decade , @xmath0 topological band insulators ( tbis ) have been found as a new family of topological phases.@xcite for the realization of a @xmath0 topological phase , the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling plays the essential role instead of the magnetic field .",
    "tbis have been extensively studied from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints , and their realization in two- and three - dimensional systems has been found in @xmath1 quantum wells @xcite and bismuth based compounds.@xcite    recently , correlation effects on the tbis have spurred intense activities in theory , since electron correlations are expected to create exotic states under topologically non - trivial conditions .",
    "this issue has further been stimulated by theoretical proposals for the realization of topological phases in @xmath2- , @xmath3- electron systems , ( e.g. iridium oxides , @xcite heusler compounds , @xcite and filled skutterudites @xcite ) . in the context of correlation effects on tbis ,",
    "the competition between long - range ordered phases and tbis have been addressed.@xcite for example , a competition between an antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase and the tbi phase was studied by numerical approaches as well as mean field theory . in a quantum monte carlo study by hohenadler _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite it was clarified that the tbi phase can change into a topologically trivial af phase .",
    "this statement was supported by the results obtained with a variational cluster approach and also by the results obtained in a cluster dynamical mean field study.@xcite the former study also clarified the absence of edge states in the af phase.@xcite    in parallel with these efforts , antiferromagnetic topological insulators ( aftis ) , i.e. af insulators having non - trivial topological structures , have been studied.@xcite such a phase was first proposed by mong _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite who found that if a three - dimensional insulator breaks both time - reversal ( @xmath4 ) and primitive - lattice translational ( @xmath5 ) symmetries but preserves the combination @xmath6 ( @xmath7 serves as the time - reversal operator at a certain plane of the brillouin zone ) , then the system may have a topological structure . according to the periodic table of tbis,@xcite aftis",
    "may not be realized in generic two - dimensional systems , but we can still find such afti phases under spin quantized conditions.@xcite    because the above studies have been restricted to hartree - fock mean - field theory , there are still open and interesting questions about aftis . this paper aims to study the aftis by incorporating electron correlations beyond the hartree - fock treatment . to this end",
    ", we analyze an extended bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model@xcite including the hubbard interaction with the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) and the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) .",
    "we elucidate the remarkable fact that an af phase can have a topologically non - trivial structure near the transition point even if the hartree - fock treatment does not support it .",
    "we demonstrate that the renormalization of the electronic states due to strong correlations is essential to stabilize the afti phase .",
    "this kind of renormalization is inherent and ubiquitous in correlated tbis , and may play the key role in realizing non - trivial ordered phases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , the model and the method are briefly explained in the next section . in sec .",

    ". a brief summary is given in the last section .",
    "we extend the bhz model , which is defined on a two - dimensional square lattice , to include an on - site coulomb interaction.@xcite the hamiltonian reads    @xmath8    where @xmath9 . the operator @xmath10 creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath11 and in orbital @xmath12 and spin @xmath13 state .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the hopping matrix @xmath14 drive the system into a non - trivial band insulator at @xmath15 .",
    "we analyze the system using dmft , which treats local correlations exactly and is suitable for the systematic calculation of arbitrary strength of the coulomb interaction . in dmft",
    ", the original lattice problem is mapped onto an effective impurity model , which is solved self - consistently.@xcite the self - consistency equation for a paramagnetic phase is given by @xmath16^{-1 } + \\hat{\\sigma}^{r}_{\\sigma}(\\omega ) , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the fourier transform of the hopping matrix .",
    "the self - energy of the lattice green s function @xmath18 can be computed from the green s function @xmath19 of the effective impurity model .",
    "note that , since the orbitals are hybridized by so coupling , the hybridization function is diagonal in the orbital index .",
    "thus , off - diagonal elements of the self - energy @xmath20 are supposed to vanish in our model . in this study",
    ", we employ the nrg method to solve the impurity model,@xcite which is a powerful method for calculations at zero - temperature . to analyze the af phase",
    ", we divide the original square lattice into two sublattices specified by checkerboard pattern . for simplicity",
    ", we study the particle - hole symmetric case and choose the model parameters as @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the hopping integral @xmath24 is chosen as the energy unit .",
    "first , let us briefly discuss the hartree - fock results . in fig . [",
    "fig : hartree ] , the results are shown as a function of the interaction strength @xmath25 .",
    "a close examination of the effective hamiltonian in the strong coupling region elucidates that the off - diagonal elements of the hopping matrix @xmath26 induce a spin dependent exchange ; the @xmath27-component of the exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic , while the in - plane components are ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) between neighbors in @xmath28- ( @xmath29- ) direction , respectively .",
    "this results from the fact that the phase of the intra - orbital hopping affects the spin - exchange process .",
    "thus , the spin configuration of the af phase is expected to be the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hartree](a ) . in this figure ,",
    "the staggered moment is parallel to the @xmath27-axis , and the in - plane components are zero . here",
    "it should be noted that this effective hamiltonian preserves four - fold symmetry ; the hamiltonian is invariant under the @xmath30 spatial rotation combined with the rotation of the spin space ( @xmath31 ) at every site , where @xmath32 represents the @xmath29 @xmath33 component of spin operator at site @xmath11 and orbital 1 , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hartree](c ) , we show that for @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , the system is in a paramagnetic phase ( af phase ) respectively .",
    "accordingly , the brillouin zone is reduced ( fig . [",
    "fig : hartree ] ( b ) ) , since the ordering vector is ( @xmath36 ) . in this figure , for @xmath37 , a hysteresis behavior is observed@xcite , and in the region of @xmath38 , the paramagnetic ( af ) solution is stable ( unstable ) .",
    "corresponding to the magnetic transition , in fig .",
    "[ fig : hartree ] ( d ) , we observe that the topological property changes at @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) with increasing ( decreasing ) interaction . as a result , a non - trivial af phase is not found .",
    "this is attributed to the large hartree shift induced in the af phase .",
    "recall that in our model , the origin of the gap depends on the energy splitting ( @xmath41 ) , where @xmath42 is the energy level of each orbital including the hartree shift , and if it becomes zero , the gap closing occurs . in the region of @xmath43 ,",
    "the gap is induced by the so interaction . moreover , in this region , we can confirm that the system possesses non - trivial topology ( see fig . 1 ( d ) ) .",
    "if the green s function has no anomaly ( gap closing or zeros of it ) , the topological properties are never changed.@xcite we thus conclude that for @xmath44 the system is driven into the non - trivial phase . keeping this in mind , we plot the energy levels in fig . [",

    "thus , we can conclude that the gap is generated by the so interaction in this region , while as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ak](c ) and ( d ) , in the trivial af phase , the peaks below the fermi energy are mainly contributed by the state @xmath76 , and thus , the gap is induced by the af order .",

    ", width=226 ]    since the system behaves as a correlated band insulator in the non - trivial af region , as mentioned above , we expand the self - energies around @xmath59 and plot the renormalized energy level of each orbital defined by @xmath77 , where the @xmath78 is the renormalization factor of each orbital in fig .",
    "[ fig : renormalized ] .",
    "note that as long as the system is recognized as a correlated band insulator , the relation @xmath79 is the condition required for existence of the so induced gap . in this figure",
    ", we can see that for @xmath80 , the state @xmath81",
    "is located below the fermi energy , implying that the energy gap is dominated by the so interaction .",
    "since such an so induced energy gap in the af phase is not observed at the hartree - fock level , we conclude that correlation effects renormalize each band and thus suppress the energy shifts resulting from the spin polarization .",
    "this kind of renormalization should commonly occur in tbis . before summarizing this paper ,",
    "the effects of spatial fluctuations , which are neglected in the dmft framework , should be mentioned .",
    "spatial fluctuations generally suppress the magnetic order and have a tendency to shift the transition point to the strongly correlated region .",
    "therefore , such fluctuations would usually cause substantial effects on magnetic transitions , so we have to carefully examine our results on the non - trivial magnetic phase .",
    "although we can not draw a definite conclusion beyond the dmft results in this paper , we expect that the non - trivial phase found here can persist even when such spatial fluctuations are incorporated .",
    "first , we should note that while the magnetic transition point is shifted to the correlated region , the topological properties also remain up to , at least , antiferromagnetic transition point as long as singularities in the green s function are absent .",
    "furthermore , as demonstrated in this paper , the band renormalization effects , which mainly originate from the local fluctuations , are essential for stabilizing the non - trivial magnetic phase .",
    "we thus expect that the essential properties of the non - trivial magnetic phase can be captured with the dmft treatment , and the qualitative properties may not be changed even in the presence of spatial fluctuations . to confirm this point , however , the microscopic analysis taking into account spatial fluctuations properly ( e.g. with cluster extension of dmft , variational cluster approach , etc . )",
    "should be necessary , which is left for our future work .",
    "finally , we comment on the edge states .",
    "the nonzero spin hall conductivity in the afti phase implies the existence of gapless spin excitations on open edges , which carries the spin hall current , when the system has open boundaries@xcite .",
    "thus one can deduce that the af order is suppressed at the edges , and the helical edge states are topologically protected against magnetic instability , in spite of the existence of the bulk af order .",
    "in summary , we have studied topological properties of the af phases in the extended bhz model including local coulomb interaction .",
    "the dmft+nrg calculation of the magnetic moment and the spin chern number has suggested the existence of a topologically non - trivial antiferromagnetic phase , where one can observe both the quantized spin hall conductivity and the magnetic order , even if the hatree - fock treatment does not support it . we have demonstrated that the correlation effects are essential to realize the non - trivial af magnetic phase ; the correlation effects strongly renormalize the energy - level shift induced by the af ordering , keeping the system still in the band - inversion regime . although the detailed situations should depend on the system under consideration",
    ", this kind of renormalization effect is inherent in the tbi caused by the band - inversion mechanism , which encourages us to look for topologically non - trivial phases in the strong correlation regime .",
