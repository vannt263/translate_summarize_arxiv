    "many gaps exist in the understanding of the post - main sequence evolution of the most massive ( @xmath640  m@xmath5 ) stars , due in large part to the small number of such stars identified as being in this evolutionary phase .",
    "it is known that during part of the post - main sequence phase , identified as the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stage ( conti 1984 ) , these stars lose a large amount of mass in a short time interval ( e.g. chiosi & maeder 1986 ) .",
    "the identifying characteristics of an lbv in addition to its blue colors are ( 1 ) a mass loss rate of ( @xmath7  m@xmath5yr@xmath1 ) , ( 2 ) a low wind velocity of no more than a few hundred kms@xmath1 , ( 3 ) photometric variations of up to 2 magnitudes on time - scales ranging from months to decades , and ( 4 ) the presence of a circumstellar ( and sometimes bipolar ) nebula ( nota & clampin 1997 ) .    less than a dozen confirmed lbvs are known in our galaxy . however , in recent years a number of lbv candidates ( lbvc s ) have been found .",
    "candidates generally have both of the first two characteristics listed above and one of the other two ( for reviews see nota & lamers 1997 ) .",
    "one recently discovered lbvc is the central star of the radio shell g79.29 + 0.46 ( higgs et al . 1994 , hereafter hwl ; and waters et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "the principal evidence for its candidacy are its high luminosity and mass loss rate ( estimated as @xmath31  @xmath8  10@xmath9 m@xmath5yr@xmath1 in paper i ) and the presence of a slightly bipolar ring nebula .",
    "few spectra have been reported and the only spectral features in them thought to be associated with the star are several recombination lines of hydrogen and helium , most notably h@xmath2 ( hwl ) and br@xmath2 ( paper  i ) .",
    "hwl also reported the presence of diffuse interstellar lines and bands .",
    "in this paper we present and discuss additional optical and near - infrared spectra of the central star of g79.29 + 0.46 ( hereafter g79 * ) .",
    "the resolution of the optical spectrum is considerably higher than the spectrum published by hwl and the infrared spectra provide considerably more wavelength coverage than the spectrum in paper  i. the new spectra allow us to estimate the excitation , luminosity and current activity of the star .",
    "we conclude that although g79 * may have gone through a more intense mass loss episode in the recent past , it probably still is in the luminous blue variable stage of evolution .",
    "a log of observations is provided in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "high resolution optical spectra of g79 * were obtained in 1995 with the utrecht echelle spectrograph ( ues ) mounted on the william herschel telescope on la palma .",
    "the tek  5 detector ( 1024@xmath81024 pixels ) was used .",
    "the slit length was 15 arcsec , allowing a portion of the nebula to be observed simultaneously .",
    "insufficient time was available to obtain the blue part of the spectrum , which is very faint due to the high extinction .",
    "two overlapping settings were chosen to cover the red part of the spectrum , with three exposures obtained at each setting .",
    "a spectrum of a thar lamp combined with telluric lines in the spectrum of the g79 * allowed the wavelength calibration to be determined to an accuracy of 1  kms@xmath1 and provided an estimate of @xmath10 for the resolving power .",
    "data reduction used the midas echelle package . because of the faintness of the object ( @xmath11  16  mag is about the limiting magnitude for the ues ) and because the position of the orders on the ccd was not constant during the night , considerable care had to be taken ( for details see voors 1999 ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the continuum in the final spectrum ( not shown ) increases from @xmath125 around 6000    to @xmath1250 around 8000   .    .observing log [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the strength of the dibs are a good measure of the interstellar extinction due to diffuse matter . in several ob associations in cygnus a tight relation exists between the strength of the @xmath135797 dib and @xmath14 , ( chlewicki et al . , 1986 ) . assuming this relation for g79.29 + 0.46 , which is very close in the sky to cyg  ob2",
    ", we obtain @xmath14 = 2.1 @xmath15 0.3 .",
    "this is much less than the values derived above .",
    "the discrepancy may be resolved if additional reddening is present in the form of molecular clouds .",
    "g79.29 + 0.46 is only 9 distant from the center of the obscured star - forming region dr 15 , which is thought to contain a few hot stars ( odenwald et al . ,",
    "an ir spectrum obtained with iso - sws morris et al .",
    "( in preparation ) shows bands of h@xmath16o and co@xmath16 ice .",
    "it remains to be determined whether the extinction derived from the iso spectrum accounts for the difference between the two values of @xmath14 , but it seems safe to conclude that the extinction to g79.29 + 0.46 contains both diffuse and molecular contributions .",
    "from the radial velocity of g79 * and after allowing for peculiar motions of up to 10  km  s@xmath1 , we derive a kinematic distance of 2  kpc from the galactic rotation curve with an uncertainty of approximately a factor of two ( see , e.g. , hwl fig .",
    "trams et al .",
    "use their best fitting model atmosphere , with a luminosity of 3@xmath810@xmath17  l@xmath5 and mass loss rate of 1.3@xmath810@xmath18m@xmath5 ( considerably higher than the estimate of paper  i ) to derive a distance of 1.8  kpc .",
    "it is virtually certain that the distance exceeds 0.7  kpc since no interstellar clouds closer than that distance are known which could cause the large observed extinction .",
    "the dr  15 complex , which we have suggested is responsible for some of the extinction to g79.29 + 0.46 , is 1  kpc distant .",
    "we conclude that the distance to g79.29 + 0.46 is in the range 1 - 4  kpc , with a most likely value of @xmath32  kpc .",
    "= 8.8 cm = 8.0 cm",
    "line profiles , averaged along the 15@xmath19 slit , excluding the regions influenced by stellar radiation , are shown in fig .",
    "the profile of h@xmath2 was averaged over a slightly smaller region along the slit than [ nii]@xmath136583 , because of contamination by the bright central peak of stellar h@xmath2 .",
    "the widths and the shapes of the broad components of the [ nii ] and the h@xmath2 nebular profiles agree very well , h@xmath2 being 2.3 times stronger .",
    "however , the narrow nebular component seen in h@xmath2 is missing in [ nii ] .",
    "clearly the narrow and broad components originate from different regions .",
    "the broad profiles of both lines are well fitted by a gaussian with fwhm 45@xmath153  kms@xmath1 .",
    "the fwzi is about 70  kms@xmath1 .",
    "the central wavelength of the gaussian is @xmath20 2  kms@xmath1 and agrees very well with the radial velocity of the central star , @xmath21  kms@xmath1 .",
    "more recent observations ( voors 1999 ) show that both the broad and narrow components extend well beyond the ring nebula , implying that they are interstellar in origin and probably associated with emission from the cygnus - x region .",
    "even at the minimum distance of 1  kpc the luminosity of g79 * is 1@xmath810@xmath17  l@xmath5 ; at the maximum distance of 4  kpc it approaches that of some of the most luminous stars known .",
    "its temperature and spectral type are not well defined , but the presence of neutral species in emission and absorption as well as n ii lines in absorption suggests it is similar to a mid b supergiant .",
    "the high luminosity , high mass loss rate , moderate wind velocity of 110  km  s@xmath1 , and presence of a circumstellar nebula all are hallmarks of an lbv .",
    "the massive dusty ring nebula surrounding g79 * indicates a period of much higher mass loss in the recent past ( paper  i ) , possibly during a red supergiant phase .",
    "the star may evolve into a wolf - rayet star .",
    "variability has not been demonstrated , but given the paucity of observations this is not surprising .",
    "more detailed spectra , such as those recently obtained for the pistol star ( najarro et al .",
    "1998 ) and fmm362 ( geballe et al . 2000 ) , are needed for g79 * in order to allow quantitative analysis , including a direct estimate of the mass loss rate , and more careful comparison with other lbvc s and lbv s .",
