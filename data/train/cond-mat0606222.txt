    "for the present work we will not concern ourselves with the subtleties of how the em field introduces the transition , we will simply assume that a photo - induced promotion occurs , by depleting the occupied states of one electron `` forming a hole '' and placing the electron near the bottom of the unoccupied `` conduction '' states .",
    "the idea is that a system initially at equilibrium will not be after the procedure : hellmann - feynman forces  @xcite due to the occupation change will cause structural rearrangements , which may be negligible or dramatic , depending on the flexibility or stability of the network , and the localization of the states .",
    "the changes in force will initially be local to the region in which the orbitals are localized , followed by transport of the thermal energy .",
    "in general , it is necessary to investigate photo - structural changes arising from various different initial and final states , though only well localized states near the gap have the potential to induce structural change  @xcite .",

    "this mobile h atom then collides ( forms a metastable bond ) with another si+db structure or breaks an si - si bond to form another si - h bond .",

    "consequently , our calculations show two basic ideas for the diffusion of h in the light - excited state : 1 ) the diffusion of hydrogen does nt only break a si - h bond but it also breaks a si - si bond and 2 ) the possibility that two mobile h atoms might form a bond to a single si atom to form a metastable sih@xmath2 structure in addition to the formation of ( h - si - si - h ) and ( h - si si - h ) structures .    in the model - ii ,",

    "the first mode is the rocking mode at 629 @xmath37 and 625 @xmath37 ; the second is the scissors mode at 810 @xmath37 and 706 @xmath37 and the last is the asymmetric stretching mode that occur at 2025 @xmath37 and 2047 @xmath37 for the first and second configurations respectively .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the ir absorption spectra for the sih@xmath2 structure .",
    "the comparison of our results for the vibrational modes of sih@xmath2 with the experiment is summarized in table [ table3 ] .",
    "the results shown in table [ table3 ] are sensitive to the basis sets used in the calculation , in agreement with other work emphasizing the delicacy of h dynamics@xcite .",
    "we have presented a direct _ ab - initio _ calculation of network dynamics and diffusion both for the electronic ground state and light - excited state for a - si : h .",
    "we computed the preferential diffusion pathways of hydrogen in the presence of photo - excited carriers . in the light - excited state ,",
    "we observe enhanced hydrogen diffusion and formation of new silicon dihydride configurations , ( h - si - si - h ) , ( h - si si - h ) , and sih@xmath2 .",
    "the two hydrogens in the sih@xmath2 unit show an average proton separation of 2.39   .",
    "the results are consistent ( a ) with the recent nmr experiments and our previous studies , and ( b ) with the hydrogen collision model of branz and other paired hydrogen model in the basic diffusion mechanism and formation of dihydride structures .",
    "in contrast , simulations in the electronic ground state do not exhibit the tendency to sih@xmath2 formation .",
    "undoubtedly , other h diffusion pathways exist , and the importance of larger simulation length and time scales as well as effects of promotions involving different states ( which could include strain defects and floating bonds@xcite ) should be undertaken .",
    "for the first time , we show the detailed dynamic pathways that arise from light - induced occupation changes , and provide one explicit example of defect creation and paired h formation .",
