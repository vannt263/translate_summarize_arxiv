    "excluded volume effects dominate the behaviour of liquids around the triple point @xcite and play a key role in structuring crystalline @xcite and amorphous solids @xcite .",
    "thus , hard spheres have long functioned as a reference system for theoretical and simulational studies of condensed matter . in 1986 ,",
    "pusey and van megen demonstrated @xcite that suspensions of sterically - stabilised polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) colloids showed nearly - perfect hard - sphere equilibrium phase behaviour , undergoing a first - order phase transition from a fluid to a crystalline state at concentrations around those predicted some time ago by computer simulations for hard spherical particles @xcite . soon afterward , the same authors showed @xcite that pmma colloids underwent a glass transition at even higher concentrations .",
    "subsequently , in a 1991 review , pusey enunciated the ` colloids as atoms ' paradigm @xcite  brownian suspensions can be used as ` test tube simulations ' of many generic condensed matter phenomena such as crystallization and vitrification . since then , the use of colloids as models has become very popular , especially since the addition of non - adsorbing polymers can be used to induce an inter - particle attraction ` tuneable ' separately in its range and depth @xcite . in such colloid - polymer mixtures ,",
    "gas - liquid coexistence can be studied @xcite , including interfaces and criticality @xcite , as well as novel modes of arrest @xcite . due to their slow intrinsic time scales ,",
    "colloids are also ideal models for studying phase transition kinetics @xcite .    while a range of inter - particle interactions are now available in model colloids , hard spheres remain an important reference system for which very direct comparison between experiments and theoretical calculations or computer simulations is in principle possible .",
    "the behaviour of a single - sized , or monodisperse , system of hard spheres is controlled by one parameter , the volume fraction @xmath0 , i.e. the fraction of the total volume @xmath2 that is filled by @xmath3 spheres , each of radius @xmath4 , @xmath5 since @xmath0 is precisely known in theory or simulations , a comparison with experiments is straightforward provided that this quantity is also accurately measurable for real suspensions .",
    "much of the literature has indeed proceeded on this basis , assuming that @xmath0 is unproblematically known from experiments .    however , as pusey and van megen pointed out in a symposium article @xcite following their _ nature _",
    "paper,@xcite the experimental determination of @xmath0 is emphatically _ not _ unproblematic , because : ( 1 ) no real colloid is truly ` hard ' , since there is always some softness in the interparticle potential ; and ( 2 ) real colloids always have a finite size distribution , i.e. they are polydisperse .",
    "thus , pusey and van megen calculated an experimental ` effective ' hard - sphere volume fraction @xmath6 , and found that the freezing and melting volume fractions of their system were @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , compared to 0.494 and 0.545 in simulations.@xcite their careful conclusion reads : ` despite ambiguities  in the experimental determination of the coexistence region this difference is probably significant . '",
    "the same degree of caution has not characterized the literature since .",
    "experimental reports typically do not discuss in any detail the method used for arriving at @xmath0 . on the other hand , theory or simulations",
    "almost always take experimental reports of @xmath0 at face value and proceed to use the data on this basis .",
    "this is unsatisfactory , particularly in situations where theory testing demands a degree of accuracy and certainty in the experimental @xmath0 that is probably unattainable . in this paper",
    ", we critically review a plethora of methods for the experimental determination of @xmath0 in hard - sphere suspensions , evaluate the degree of accuracy attainable in each case , comment on the potential discrepancies between methods , and give a case study showing how different experiments should be compared taking into account possible difference in @xmath0 determination .    with the increasing popularity of confocal microscopy , direct counting of particles is becoming a standard method for determining @xmath0 ( see sec .",
    "[ particlecounting ] ) .",
    "this method depends on knowing the particle size .",
    "thus , after introducing model colloids ( section  [ particles ] ) , we review particle sizing ( section  [ sizesec ] ) .",
    "the ` classic ' method for determining @xmath0 is via the crystallization phase behaviour , which changes with polydispersity@xcite .",
    "so we review polydispersity measurements ( section  [ polysec ] ) before turning to consider the determination of @xmath0 in detail ( section  [ volsec ] ) .",
    "we finish with a case study ( section  [ casestudy ] ) and a conclusion .",
    "we focus on suspensions of nearly - perfect hard spheres .",
    "a system that potentially behaves most like perfect hard spheres is charge - stabilised colloidal silica in water .",
    "when the charges are sufficiently screened out by the addition of salt @xcite , the resulting suspension is very close to being hard - sphere - like .",
    "however , a significant drawback of silica as a model system is that these particles have a density @xmath9 g/@xmath10 , and it has proved impossible to find solvents that match this density . the sedimentation problem can be alleviated by using smaller particles , but at the expense of increasing polydispersity .",
    "charged - stabilised polystyrene spheres are also potentially very hard - sphere - like , and are easier to density match , though ( unlike silica ) almost impossible to refractive index match .",
    "a more popular model hard sphere system is pmma , sterically stabilized by a @xmath11  nm layer of phsa ( poly-12-hydroxystearic acid ) @xcite .",
    "this layer confers a degree of softness to the interparticle potential on the scale of @xmath12 .",
    "pmma particles can be dispersed in solvent mixtures that match both the particles density and index of refraction @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , particle swelling by solvents is endemic @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the swelling process can take several weeks , so the particle size changes over time , though heat shock may speed up the process to taking only a few hours @xcite .",
    "as swelling is poorly characterized , _ in situ _ measurement is the only reliable means of ensuring that it is complete before the particles are used in experiments .",
    "this is particularly important at high @xmath0 , where many properties are steep functions of the concentration : an @xmath13% increase in the particle radius translates into @xmath14% in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , e.g. , an index - matching mixture of cis - decalin and tetrachloroethylene causes 20% swelling , which has a drastic effect upon the colloid volume fraction @xcite . finally , batch - to - batch variations generate further uncertainties .",
    "below , we focus on pmma particles , although much of what we say will also apply to silica and other model systems .",
    "the basic parameter characterizing spherical colloidal particles is their radius , @xmath4 .",
    "some methods of determining @xmath0 , most obviously by ` counting ' from confocal microscopy images , depend directly on measuring @xmath4 . in this section",

    "but this is deceptive , fig .",
    "[ pmma ] . for sterically - stabilized particles like pmma",
    ", we can usefully define as least four different radii .",
    "first , the _ hydrodynamic _ radius , @xmath17 , occurs in the relationship between the drag , @xmath18 , on a particle moving at velocity @xmath19 in a fluid of viscosity @xmath20 at low reynolds numbers , @xmath21 , where the friction coefficient @xmath22 relating @xmath17 to @xmath0 is a non - trivial problem in hydrodynamics .",
    "somewhat more directly related to @xmath0 is the _ core _ radius , @xmath23 , which is the radius of the sterically - stabilized particles _ minus _ the stabilizing hairs .",
    "thirdly , if we can determine the average hair thickness @xmath15 , then the _ core - shell _ radius , @xmath16 . for ` hairless ' particles , such as charge - stabilized silica , @xmath24 . finally , we may assign an _ effective hard sphere _",
    "radius , @xmath25 , to the particles to obtain the best fit to theory or simulations of hard - sphere behaviour in a certain range of @xmath0 , so that @xmath25 is inevitably dependent on the chosen property and @xmath0 range .",
    "we will not review established sizing methods in any detail , but will reference existing literature and note cautionary points . then we will introduce a number of newer methods .      scattering methods have a long history in sizing spherical particles@xcite .",
    "static and dynamic scattering determine the size of particles by measuring the time - averaged or fluctuating intensity of the scattered light respectively .",
    "dynamic light scattering ( dls ) and its x ray equivalent , x ray photon correlation spectroscopy ( xpcs ) , measure the diffusion coefficient of particles , which is related to the friction coefficient via the stokes - einstein - sutherland relation@xcite : @xmath26 . dls and xpcs therefore determine @xmath17 ( cf .",
    "[ xi ] ) , and are most useful in the case of particles consisting of core only , such as silica , since it is less clear how to relate @xmath17 to @xmath27 for core - shell particles such as pmma .",
    "note that the accuracy of this method depends on having an accurate value for @xmath20 , the solvent viscosity , which is temperature dependent .",
    "for example , we have found that for the common solvent mixture cyclohexylbromide and decalin ( 85%/15% by weight ) @xmath28c , @xmath29  mpa@xmath30s and @xmath31 mpa@xmath30s / k .",
    "thus , a 1@xmath32c uncertainly in @xmath33 is a 0.3% uncertainty of @xmath33 but a 1.7% uncertainty in @xmath34 and therefore in @xmath17 .",
    "static light scattering ( sls ) , small - angle x ray scattering ( saxs ) or small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) can potentially determine @xmath23 and @xmath27 .",
    "since the core and shell of ( say ) a pmma particle in general has different contrasts to light , x rays ( refractive index , @xmath35 , in both cases ) and neutrons ( scattering length , @xmath36 ) , the diffraction pattern of a single particle is determined by the interference of radiation scattered from these two parts .",
    "fitting this diffraction pattern ( the form factor ) therefore can in principle yield @xmath23 and @xmath37 . in a solvent with @xmath35 or @xmath36 quite different from both the core and the shell , the whole entity scatters more or less as a homogeneous sphere and a radius close to @xmath27",
    "is returned from form - factor fitting .",
    "when solvent mixtures are used to ` tune ' the relative contrasts of core and shell , even a small amount of a minority component in the solvent mixture can swell the particles by up to 10% or more@xcite , and the fractional swelling of core and shell is not necessarily identical . in xpcs , where the shell has little contrast , @xmath12 can not be accurately determined ; however , the brightness of the beam gives many orders of oscillations in the form factor , allowing very accurate data fitting .    for both static and dynamic scattering , samples must be dilute enough so that the properties of non - interacting particles are measured in the single - scattering limit .",
    "the only sure way to know that this has been achieved is to collect data at different @xmath0 and look for the convergence in the @xmath38 limit .",
    "static scattering at finite @xmath0 gives the static structure factor as a function of scattering vector , @xmath39 .",
    "fitting this to , e.g. , the percus - yevick form @xcite or simulations yields simultaneously @xmath25 and @xmath0 , although polydispersity is a significant complication@xcite .",
    "alternatively , the bragg peaks in @xmath39 from colloidal crystals at fluid - crystal coexistence can be used to deduce @xmath25 if the melting point is known ( but see section  [ polysec ] for caveats ) .",
    "electron microscopy ( em ) measures @xmath23 of dried particles , because drying collapses the steric - stabilizing ` hairs ' in core - shell particles such as pmma , and deswells particles swollen by solvent when dispersed .",
    "various optical microscopies can , in principle , be used in the same way as em for sizing particles ; caveats are pointed out in section  [ radiuscase ] .",
    "dls measures diffusion via determining the intermediate scattering function ( isf ) , which is the spatial fourier transform of a time - dependent density - density correlation function@xcite ; it requires a laser and bespoke electronics ( a correlator ) .",
    "recently , a method for measuring the isf has been demonstrated@xcite that requires only the use of everyday laboratory equipment , viz . , a white - light optical microscope and a ccd camera .",
    "this method , differential dynamic microscopy ( ddm ) , exploits the fact that the intensity of a low - resolution microscope imaging is linearly related to the density of particles in the sample being imaged@xcite .",
    "thus , correlating the fourier transform of the images gives directly the isf .",
    "being a scattering method , dls works in reciprocal space .",
    "ddm uses microscope images , but also yields the isf in reciprocal space . in both cases ,",
    "the measured quantity is the diffusion coefficient , which controls the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) of brownian particles : @xmath40 , with @xmath41 or 6 in 1 , 2 or 3 dimensions respectively .",
    "direct real - space methods for measuring the msd are increasingly popular .",
    "the motion of particles in a dilute sample ( @xmath42 ) can be captured by video microscopy@xcite , and the particle motion tracked@xcite using publicly available software@xcite .",
    "provided the microscope has been properly calibrated , such tracks yield the msd .",
    "problems can occur at short and long times .",
    "the issue at short times is measurement error due to pixellation .",
    "the pixellation error for a particle whose image is @xmath3 pixels in diameter with individual pixels of width @xmath43 is roughly @xmath44 . in 1 dimension ,",
    "a positional uncertainty of @xmath45 generates an apparent msd of @xmath46 , which is time independent , giving @xmath47 if the short - time msd plateau due to @xmath46 is observed , it provides an excellent means of determining the measurement uncertainty @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ figmsd ] shows that it is important to take this term into account for accurate determination of @xmath48 by tracking .",

    "touching particles can be generated in a spun - down sediment@xcite , or by inducing a very short range attraction ( e.g. by adding small non - adsorbing polymers ) . while the first peak of @xmath63 is typically averaged over @xmath64 correlations , and so is in principle highly accurate , the particle size in a typical confocal image is @xmath65 pixels , which limits the best accuracy to @xmath66  pixel .",

    "the resulting expressions can be used to fit dynamic or static scattering data to yield rather accurate values of @xmath80 .",
    "we now turn to describe and evaluate a number of methods for determining the volume fraction of model colloids .",
    "the method used by pusey and van megen to determine @xmath0 in their classic work on hard - sphere colloid phase behaviour@xcite and described subsequently in detail in a symposium paper@xcite remains conceptually the simplest .",
    "they dried a suspension of known total ( or ` wet ' ) mass to determine the mass of dry particles , and converted the resulting mass fraction into @xmath0 using literature values of the densities of the solvents and of ( dry ) pmma .",
    "there are multiple assumptions behind this procedure that lead to systematic uncertainties .",
    "in particular , this procedure assumes that the properties of dry and wet particles are the same , which , due to solvent absorption and solvation of the ` hairs ' , is unlikely to be true .",
    "thus , many have subsequently proceeded differently .",
    "if @xmath0 has been separately determined for one sample using other methods ( e.g. at @xmath85 or @xmath84 , see below ) , the the ratio of mass to volume fractions can be used to calibrate other samples .",
    "but the exact relationship between these two quantities is not a direct proportionality , and involves ( unknown ) ratios of the properties of wet and dry particles .",
    "a somewhat more involved procedure is in principle less problematic@xcite .",
    "first , one determines the hydrodynamic radius @xmath17 from dynamic light scattering .",
    "then the sedimentation velocity , @xmath90 , of a dilute suspension is determined by analytic centrifugation to obtain the density difference between the ( wet ) particles and the solvent , @xmath91 : @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the solvent viscosity ( separately measured ) and @xmath94 is the gravitational acceleration , although the assumption that the non - slip boundary condition holds at the ` hairy ' particle surface may not be strictly valid ( e. sloutskin , personal communication ) .",
    "since liquid densities can be determined very accurately using pycnometry or other densitometric methods if the temperature is controlled , we can measure @xmath95 and the density of an arbitrary suspension , @xmath96 , from which its @xmath0 can be determined using @xmath97      a popular method of calibrating @xmath0 relies on the known phase behaviour of hard spheres . in particular , in the region @xmath98 , hard spheres show coexistence of fluid at @xmath85 and crystals at @xmath84 .",
    "the fraction of crystals , @xmath99 , increases linearly from 0 to 100% over the interval .",
    "measuring @xmath99 for a sample within the coexistence region then gives its @xmath0 . to determine @xmath99 accurately , one needs to take into account the compression of the crystalline sediment by its own weight@xcite .",
    "the main uncertainty associated with using phase behaviour to calibrate @xmath0 is the effect of polydispersity . all calculations and simulations to date agree that finite @xmath80 increases @xmath85 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus , e.g. , in the ` moment free energy ' calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ sollichfig ] , @xmath100 and @xmath101 at @xmath102 , the latter being a representative value of a typical preparation of pmma colloids . to date there has been no independent experimental check on such theoretical predictions , one of the main issues being the measurement of @xmath0 in polydisperse colloids !",
    "nevertheless , these results may throw light on one of the puzzles remaining from the original work of pusey and van megen@xcite , who found that if they assumed a freezing point of @xmath82 , their measured melting point was @xmath103 .",
    "the ratio @xmath104 of these two values , which characterises the width of the coexistence gap , is @xmath105 . for monodisperse colloids , @xmath106 , while calculations@xcite for @xmath102 gives @xmath107 .",
    "it is therefore possible that the narrowing of the coexistence gap observed by pusey and van megen is largely due to polydispersity .",
    "note , however , that the phase diagram likely depends on the whole @xmath79 and not just @xmath80 .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty is residual charge@xcite so that , hard - sphere phase behaviour no longer obtains : crystallization is expected at lower volume fractions ( for pmma , see , e.g.@xcite ) . in these cases the phase behaviour can not be matched to that of hard spheres at all .",
    "however , by adding salt , the charges can be screened and hard sphere behaviour recovered to an extent ( e.g. , for pmma , see@xcite ) .",
    "we mention that confocal microscopy of a sample in the fluid - crystal coexistence region can be used to deduce a value for @xmath25 by assuming particular values for @xmath85 and @xmath84@xcite , subject to all the above - mentioned caveats and uncertainties .",
    "perhaps the quickest way to obtain samples with approximately calibrated @xmath0 is by centrifuging to obtain a sediment that one assumes to be at ` random close packing ' ( rcp ) , and therefore some known @xmath108 , which can then be redispersed with fixed volumes of solvent to give samples at lower concentrations .",
    "the method can be applied even with charged particles , since hard centrifugation can reduce even such particles to a mutually - touching amorphous state@xcite .",
    "the main problem with this method is that the theoretical status of rcp is still debated , with different simulation algorithms giving different results@xcite .",
    "experimentally , different regions of the centrifuged sediment have somewhat different concentrations ( @xmath109 in silica colloids@xcite ) , and little is known about the almost - certain dependence of sediment structure on centrifugation protocol .",
    "moreover , the spun - down sediment is inevitably compressed , and will expand with time after the cessation of centrifugation , which introduces an extra degree of uncertainty . finally , the dependence on polydispersity is poorly known@xcite .",
    "but centrifugation is convenient , and if the protocol is kept constant , it can be used to produce a series of samples with highly accurate normalized concentrations , viz . , @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the volume fraction of the sediment .    under this heading",
    ", we may mention that particles with small enough gravitational pclet number@xcite ( either by virtue of near density matching or by virtue of being small ) and low enough polydispersity will sediment slowly under gravity to form sedimentary crystals consisting of more or less randomly - stacked hexagonal close packed ( rhcp ) layers of particles . if the particles are monodisperse hard spheres , then @xmath112 in this sediment .",
    "again , however , the ( largely unknown ) effect of polydispersity as well as any changes due to charges need to be taken into account .",
    "confocal microscopy can be used to locate the position of thousands of particles in a suspension .",
    "thus , if the particle radius , @xmath4 , is known , then counting @xmath3 particle in an imaging volume @xmath2 will yield @xmath0 directly using eqn .",
    "[ phidef ] .",
    "occasional particle mis - identification or missing a particle all together by the software give rise to erroneous @xmath0 , so that it is important to cross - check particle positions identified against raw images . in particular , particles near the edge of images",
    "are often mis - identified , so that in practice a sub - volume only is considered .",
    "finally , uncertainties in @xmath4 are magnified 3-fold or more in calculating @xmath0 .",
    "this latter uncertainty is compounded by the issue of which of the possible radii ( section  [ radiusdefine ] ) one should use .",
    "the intensity of x rays transmitted by a sample is given by @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the incident intensity , @xmath49 and @xmath13 are the attenuation coefficient and thickness of the sample . in the case of a colloidal suspension , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the volume fraction of particle _ cores _ , and @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the attenuation coefficients of the solvent and particles . the negligible amount of electron density represented by sterically - stabilizing ` hairs ' means that they hardly contribute to the beam attenuation .",
    "x ray transmission can therefore be used to determine @xmath0 directly for model colloids such as charge - stabilised polystyrene @xcite or silica@xcite , but only the core volume fraction for sterically - stabilised particles .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of a number of material properties of hard - sphere suspensions are known either from analytic theory or highly - accurate simulations . in principle , therefore , measuring these properties can be used to determine @xmath0 . here",
    "we review three : viscosity , diffusivity and structure factor .",
    "einstein predicted that in the limit @xmath38 , the viscosity of a hard - sphere suspension is given by @xmath119 , with @xmath93 being the viscosity of the solvent @xcite .",
    "thus , in principle , measuring @xmath120 is a method for determining @xmath0 ( e.g.@xcite ) . while suspensions in general shear thin",
    ", this should not be a problem in the very dilute limit .",
    "but temperature control is important , since @xmath93 is temperature sensitive ( cf .",
    "section  [ established ] ) .",
    "the problems associated with this method have been detailed before@xcite .",
    "in essence , very low @xmath0 , certainly @xmath121 , must be reached for the einstein result to be valid ; otherwise , second@xcite and higher order term in this ` virial ' expansion needs to be taken into account . in the case",
    "cited@xcite , using the einstein relation at @xmath122 leads to an error in @xmath0 of @xmath123@xcite .",
    "the difficulty , of course , is that in the limit @xmath38 , _ very _ accurate viscometry is needed to distinguish the dilute suspension from pure solvent . using the einstein relation to calibrate @xmath0 in suspensions that are too concentrated for the relation to be valid accounts for some of the spread in literature values of @xmath124 , the viscosity of the most concentrated stable fluid state of hard spheres .",
    "interestingly , determining @xmath0 using the einstein relation is strictly independent of polydispersity : in the dilute limit , each particle contributes by an additive amount that is proportional to its volume .    instead of measuring @xmath120 , one could determine the single - particle diffusion coefficient as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , el masri _",
    "et al._@xcite measured the short - time self diffusion coefficient as a function of volume fraction , @xmath125 .",
    "the difficulty is that there are at least two different predictions for this behaviour @xcite which leads to a 7% absolute uncertainty in @xmath0 .",
    "lastly , we have already mentioned ( section  [ established ] ) that analytical expressions for the static structure factor , @xmath39 , of hard spheres are available . in particular",
    ", the closed - form expression from the percus - yevick ( py ) approximation @xcite fits simulation data closely , provided that the empirical verlet - weis correction to the volume fraction@xcite is applied , i.e. the py structure factor for volume fraction @xmath126 is used for an experimental sample at @xmath0 : @xmath127 .",
    "thus , fitting measured @xmath39 can yield a measure of @xmath0 , provided that the particles can be treated as hard spheres . again , caution about residual charges applies .",
    "alternatively , @xmath63 determined from confocal microscopy can be fitted to the py form or to simulation data@xcite to give @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we explain how using an accurately calibrated ` stock colloid ' may still lead to errors in the @xmath0 of samples .",
    "first , we have already mentioned a number of times the issue of swelling .",
    "if particles used for calibrating volume fraction are still in the process of swelling due to solvent absorption , then samples prepared subsequently will have a higher @xmath0 than the earlier calibration would suggest .",
    "secondly , preparing samples almost invariably involves transferring suspension from one container ( e.g. a bottle of stock ) to another ( e.g. a capillary for microscopy ) using ( typically ) a pipette or a syringe .",
    "apart from difficulties caused by very high viscosities@xcite and shear thickening@xcite , there is the problem of jamming of the particles as the suspension enters a constriction@xcite , which leads to a ` self filtration ' effect .",
    "particles jammed at ( say ) the entrance to a pipette prevents other particles from entering , but solvent continues to flow , so that the sample inside the pipette has a lower @xmath0 than the bulk suspension that we hope to transfer .",
    "thus , a sample loaded for confocal microscopy may be more dilute than one expects .",
    "thirdly , except for very well density - matched samples at a temperature accurately remaining at the temperature at which the density matching was originally achieved , suspension inevitably sediment ( or cream ) with time at all except @xmath108 or @xmath128 .",
    "this will lead to concentration gradients .",
    "indeed , such gradients can be deliberated exploited@xcite , e.g. to determine equations of state .",
    "but in other cases , concentration gradients lead to unintended local deviations from the average @xmath0 at which the sample as a whole was originally prepared .",
    "since one of the most important uses of hard - sphere colloids is as a model to study dynamical arrest@xcite and associated properties such as aging@xcite , any of the above three sources of unintended changes in @xmath0 will have severe consequences : all suspension properties change very rapidly with @xmath0 at and above the glass transition ( @xmath129 ) .    ): the normalized long - time self diffusion coefficient of pmma colloids as a function of volume fraction , @xmath130@xcite , with the volume fraction multiplied by 1.022 .",
    "( @xmath77 ) : the normalized low - shear viscosity of pmma colloids , @xmath131 , as a function of volume fraction@xcite .",
    "( @xmath132 ) : the volume fraction of the viscosity data set being multiplied by 0.965 .",
    "( b ) violation of stokes - einstein - sutherland relation .",
    "the factor @xmath133 , eqn .",
    "[ beta ] , from the raw data ( @xmath132 ) , from theory@xcite ( @xmath78 ) and after the @xmath0 values of the viscosity data set having been multiplied by 0.965 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    ", width=207 ]      the most important message from the preceding critical review is that the _ statistical _ errors involved in determining @xmath0 in the competent use of any of the above methods can almost certainly be brought below the _ systematic _ errors involved .",
    "thus , for example , if one uses confocal microscopy to count particles and thus determine @xmath0 , the major source of uncertainty is likely to be the input radius .",
    "thus , it is perfectly possible to produce a series of samples with _ relative _ uncertainty in @xmath0 of 1 part in @xmath134 .",
    "however , our collective experience in using many of these methods suggests that the systematic uncertainties are unlikely to be below 3 - 6% .",
    "far from being a small error , such uncertainties can have dramatic effects .",
    "thus , e.g. , the viscosity of a hard - sphere suspension@xcite grows by a factor of 2 when @xmath0 increases from 0.47 to 0.49 ; and the simulated crystal nucleation rate@xcite near @xmath85 can change by 10 orders of magnitude for a 1% change in the absolute value of @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we give a case study to illustrate how important it is to be critical about experimental @xmath0 values by analyzing two published data sets .",
    "these data sets give as a function of @xmath0 the long - time self diffusion coefficient , @xmath135@xcite , and the low - shear viscosity , @xmath120@xcite , of pmma colloids . at the time of publication ,",
    "the diffusion data was the best and most complete available , and the viscosity data remain one of the most complete to date .",
    "the two groups came to quite different conclusions about dynamical divergence at high @xmath0 .",
    "van megen and his collaborators concluded that @xmath135 diverged at @xmath136 , in a manner consistent with that predicted by mode coupling theory for an ideal glass transition .",
    "chaikin and his collaborators , however , concluded from their @xmath120 that there was no glass transition at @xmath137 ; instead , they suggested that @xmath120 diverged at rcp , @xmath138 , according to a volgel - fulcher law .",
    "this controversy is ongoing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we do _ not _ to enter into this discussion here ; instead , we use older data to illustrate many of the issues concerned with measuring @xmath0 and using experimental data sets . these issues are , of course , pertinent for the ongoing discussion .",
    "the first thing to notice about these two experiments is that the reported volume fractions can not be compared directly . both sets of authors relied on measuring phase behaviour to calibrate @xmath0 ( cf . section  [ phases ] ) , but one set of authors took into account polydispersity , and one did not .",
    "van megen and co - workers used @xmath82 , the value for monodisperse hard spheres , to determine @xmath0 , but cautioned that their particles had a polydispersity of @xmath102 .",
    "the colloids used by chaikin and his co - workers also had the same @xmath80 , and they used the simulation data of bolhuis and kofke @xcite to move freezing to @xmath139 for this polydispersity .",
    "interestingly , the latest analytic calculations agree closely : wilding and sollich@xcite give @xmath100 at @xmath102 , fig .",
    "[ sollichfig ] .",
    "thus , we multiply the @xmath0 value of the van megen data set by a factor of @xmath140 to make it consistent with the chaikin @xmath0 values .",
    "the resulting data are shown in fig .",
    "[ caution ] .",
    "the measurements have been normalised , @xmath135 by the single - particle diffusivity , @xmath141 , and @xmath120 by the solvent viscosity , @xmath93 .",
    "the normalized viscosity diverges at higher @xmath0 than the normalized ( inverse ) diffusivity .    at @xmath38 ,",
    "the solvent viscosity and the single - particle diffusivity are related by the stokes - einstein - sutherland relation ( sesr ) : @xmath142 . at finite @xmath0",
    ", there is no _ a priori _ reason that a generalized sesr should hold for any of the many diffusion coefficients that can be defined .",
    "so we write @xmath143 where @xmath133 is a numerical factor that can be restated as @xmath144 we plot in fig",
    ".  [ caution](b ) ( diamonds ) the @xmath145 implied by the data sets in fig .",
    "[ caution](a ) . in",
    "so far as @xmath146 , the sesr is violated .",
    "violation of the sesr is widely known for glass - forming systems near the glass transition . in all experimental cases known ( see e.g.@xcite ) , @xmath147 , i.e. the particles diffuse somewhat faster than the viscosity allows according to the sesr . the fact that @xmath133 drops very substantially below unity at @xmath148 in fig .",
    "[ caution](b ) is therefore surprising , and merits further analysis .",
    "to proceed , we turn to the work of banchio _ et al._@xcite , who have calculated various diffusivities and viscosities of hard sphere suspensions within a mode - coupling framework , and have shown that their results compared well with multiple experimental data sets .",
    "their calculations predict that @xmath133 as defined in eqn .",
    "[ beta ] hovers just below unity in the range @xmath149 .",
    "[ caution](b ) shows that the experimental @xmath145 from the data plotted in fig .",
    "[ caution](a ) ( diamonds ) essentially agrees with theory ( squares ) up to @xmath150 , but start to diverge thereafter .    since we conclude that absolute values of @xmath0 are unlikely to be accurate to better than @xmath151 , it is interesting to note that multiplying the volume fractions in the viscosity data set by a factor of 0.965 overlaps the two normalized data sets , fig .",
    "[ caution](a ) .",
    "not surprisingly , then , this renormalization of @xmath0 also brings very substantially better agreement in @xmath145 in the whole range of @xmath0 covered by theory@xcite ( triangles , fig .",
    "[ caution](b ) ) . assuming that there is a glass transition at @xmath152 , then this renormalization of @xmath0 also brings the direction of sesr violation in the vicinity of @xmath153 in line with all other known glass formers , viz .",
    ", @xmath154 .",
    "thus , the supposed disagreement between the two data sets is well within the range of expected uncertainties in the absolute determination of @xmath0 .",
    "hard sphere colloids are now part of the accepted ` tool kit ' of experimental statistical mechanics .",
    "what we aim to do in this critical review is to counsel caution in comparing data from experiments against theory or simulations , because there are substantial , and probably irreducible , systematic errors in determining suspension volume fraction .",
    "this situation calls for at least three responses .",
    "first , experimentalists need to take the cue from the pioneering work of pusey and van megen@xcite and always report exactly _ how _ they arrive at their quoted @xmath0 values , and discuss likely sources particularly of _ systematic _ errors .",
    "secondly , experimental data sets need to be compared vigilantly against each other to reveal possible discrepancies .",
    "finally , theorists and simulators seeking experimental confirmation of their results should not be too easily satisfied with apparent agreement , at least not until in - depth inquiry into the systematic uncertainties in @xmath0 has been carried out .",
    "finally , we note that while perfect hard spheres are indeed characterized by a single thermodynamic variable @xmath0 , real particles are never truly hard .",
    "some softness in sterically - stabilized particles necessarily comes from compressible ` hairs ' , but this becomes less significant as @xmath4 increase .",
    "however , it is becoming clear that for larger ( @xmath155 m ) pmma particles , a certain degree of charging is inevitable@xcite , which can not be entirely screened by salt ( due to limited solubility in organic solvents ) .",
    "such softness means that accurate measurement of @xmath0 alone is insufficient , and introduces further uncertainties .",
