    "the characteristic modes of black holes and black branes are eigenmodes of these systems which convey important information about the background geometry .",
    "these systems are intrinsically dissipative ( energy flows to the event horizon and/or towards the spatial infinity ) and therefore their eigenmodes are not stationary .",
    "one calls the eigenmodes of these dissipative systems quasinormal modes ( qnms ) @xcite . within the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) duality @xcite ,",
    "these modes serve as an important tool for determining the near - equilibrium properties of strongly coupled quantum field theories , in particular their transport coefficients such as viscosity , conductivity and diffusion constants @xcite . recently ,",
    "qnms have also been used to study properties like the `` meson melting '' in d3/d7-brane models @xcite and the spectrum of collective excitations of holographic superconductors @xcite .",
    "it is thus of interest to understand the spectrum of black holes and black branes in asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes .",
    "recent studies by festuccia and liu ( henceforth fl ) have shed light on this issue , predicting the existence of long - lived modes in asymptotically ads black hole ( bh ) geometries @xcite .",
    "their work shows that the eikonal limit in ads depends sensitively on the relative size of the black hole . for small black holes ,",
    "they find exponentially long - lived modes , which can be thought of as modes trapped inside the potential barrier .",
    "if we write @xmath0 for the typical `` energy '' eigenvalue , these modes take the bohr - sommerfeld form 2i_r_b^qdr=(2n+ ) , n=0,1, ... [bohrsommerfeld ] where q , @xmath1 is the black - hole horizon function ( see eq .",
    "( [ lineelementads ] ) below ) , and @xmath2 is the angular momentum of the perturbation . accordingly , their lifetime is dictated by a `` tunneling probability '' of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two real zeros ( turning points ) of @xmath6 , and the proportionality coefficient is given in @xcite .",
    "this prediction is supported by numerical studies for small ads black holes @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the nature of the long - lived modes for large black holes is completely different , since no trapped modes are allowed in the large black - hole regime .",
    "a consequence of this fact is that the `` breit - wigner resonance method '' used to investigate small ads black holes fails to give reliable results in the large black - hole regime @xcite .",
    "these modes are also expected to be long - lived @xcite ( see section [ eikonal ] below ) .",
    "thus these modes will presumably dominate the bh s response to arbitrary perturbations , hence the thermalization timescale in the dual cft .",
    "since their existence may be very relevant for the ads / cft conjecture , we decided to investigate numerically these long - lived modes .",
    "we use two , well established methods to study the qnms of black holes .",
    "one is the series solution expansion @xcite , which outputs the characteristic frequencies directly and is especially well suited for large black holes . by using time - domain methods ,",
    "in particular the scattering of gaussian wavepackets @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , we confirm and expand the series solution results and furthermore show that these modes _ are _ excited in physically interesting situations . as a by - product , we confirm once more that there are no late - time tails in this geometry .",
    "bh s in asymptotically ads spacetimes form a class of solutions which is interesting from a theoretical point of view and central for the study of strongly coupled field theories at finite temperature in the gauge / gravity duality framework .",
    "we are interested in a simple class of non - rotating , uncharged @xmath7-dimensional schwarzschild - ads black holes with line element ds^2= -fdt^2+f^-1dr^2+r^2d_d-2 ^ 2 , [ lineelementads ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the metric of the unitary @xmath10-sphere .",
    "the ads curvature radius @xmath11 is related to the cosmological constant @xmath12 by @xmath13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is proportional to the mass @xmath15 of the black hole : @xmath16 , where @xmath17}$ ] .",
    "the well - known schwarzschild geometry corresponds to @xmath18 .",
    "the black - hole horizon radius @xmath19 is the ( unique ) positive real root of @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , we want to focus here on the large black hole regime , @xmath21 . in this case , the above geometry goes over to a @xmath22dimensional plane - symmetric spacetime ( black brane ) @xcite , which is also an exact solution of einstein s equations @xcite .",
    "the black brane has the following line element [ fundo ] ds^2=-f(r)dt^2 + r^2^d-2_i=1dx^idx_i+dr^2 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole ( [ lineelementads ] ) is [ hawkingtemp ] t= , and it reduces to @xmath24 for large black holes , which is the hawking temperature of the black brane ( [ fundo ] ) .",
    "gravitational perturbations in these backgrounds were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath25 and in @xcite for higher dimensions . in a generic number of dimensions",
    ", the gravitational perturbations can be divided in three different types , the tensor- , vector- and scalar - type perturbations .",
    "these can all be reduced to a master wave equation of the form f^2+ff+ ( ^2-v(r))=0,[waveeq ] where the potential @xmath26 depends on both the type of perturbation and on basis functions used to separate the coordinates of the ( @xmath27)-dimensional hypersurface of constant @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "for instance , for tensor - type perturbations in the black - hole background ( [ lineelementads ] ) , = + f+ .[potsads ] here , the angular number @xmath2 is related to the eigenvalue of the hyper - spherical functions used to factor out the dependence on the @xmath10-spherical angles .    for the black brane background ( [ fundo ] )",
    ", the separation of trivial dimensions is achieved through the ansatz @xmath30 and one ends up with the large @xmath31 limit of ( [ potsads ] ) , [ pott ] = .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath26 for the vector- and scalar - type perturbations can be found in refs .",
    "the potential for tensor - type gravitational perturbations is equal to the potential for scalar - field perturbations , so our results are also valid for spin-0 fields",
    ".    we will be interested in the large-@xmath32 limit of the qnm frequencies , i.e. , characteristic @xmath33 s for which the solutions to ( [ waveeq ] ) satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "note that in this limit one can formally identify @xmath34 with @xmath2 in the black hole / black brane spacetimes .",
    "hereafter we will always refer to @xmath34 , with the understanding that the replacement @xmath35 describes large black holes .",
    "an important characteristic of classical field evolutions on asymptotically ads spacetimes is the variety of choices for the boundary conditions at spatial infinity . in general",
    ", these can be dirichlet , neumann or robin boundary conditions .",
    "so we need to establish an objective criterion before to choose a specific condition . in the ads",
    "/ cft context , a natural criterion is such that the qnm frequencies of a certain field correspond to poles of two - point correlation functions of the dual operator in the boundary field theory @xcite .    when we consider a variable @xmath36 such that the master equation for the gravitational perturbations is of the form ( [ waveeq ] ) , in general the dirichlet condition at spatial infinity",
    "is the ` correct ' boundary condition .",
    "there is only _",
    "one _ exception : for scalar - type perturbations in four spacetime dimensions , the boundary condition that leads to qnm frequencies corresponding to poles of retarded correlation functions is of robin type ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion in @xmath37 and @xcite for an arbitrary number of dimensions . )      in asymptotically ads spacetimes the eikonal limit is especially interesting , since large-@xmath34 modes can be very long - lived @xcite .",
    "a wkb analysis suggests that for the tensor - type gravitational perturbations ( and therefore also scalar fields ) and @xmath38 @xcite , the following asymptotic behavior holds r^fl&=&q+ _",
    "n ( ) ^ q^ - , [ eikonalads ] + _ n & & ( ) ^e^-,as @xmath39",
    ". so large-@xmath34 modes are very long - lived , and they could play a prominent role in the bh s response to generic perturbations .",
    "this is at variance with the asymptotically flat case , where the damping timescale is roughly constant as @xmath34 varies .",
    "notice also that the scaling with the bh size differs from that of the weakly- and highly - damped modes .",
    "c    we use two conceptually different methods to determine the gravitational qnm frequencies of the spacetimes and , and both methods yield consistent results , within the expected error bars .",
    "the first consists on a series expansion method @xcite , which reduces the problem to finding roots of a polynomial .",
    "this method is well suited to large black holes and black branes , though the convergence properties worsen for large wavenumber @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , for larger dimensions ( @xmath40 ) and higher overtones ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) the problems of convergence of the series solution arise even for intermediate wavenumber values ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the second method employed in this work consists on a direct time - evolution in these backgrounds @xcite .",
    "a particular example is shown in figure [ fig : timeevolution ] , which shows the time - development of a gaussian wavepacket in a @xmath44 black brane .",
    "the ringdown is characterized by the decay timescale and ringing frequency , which can directly be extracted from the slope and frequency of the signal above .",
    "equivalently , we characterize the qnms by a complex frequency @xmath0 .",
    "time evolution methods can not determine very accurately which overtone is dominating the response , though experience has shown that the fundamental mode seems to be more excited than all others , and by definition decays much slower @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the scattering of wavepackets shows that weakly - damped modes _ are _ excited in physically interesting situations .",
    "although not the direct focus of this work , our numerical results show no sign of a power - law tail at late stages , confirming earlier predictions @xcite .",
    "c +    in figure [ fig : sadss ] we show numerical results for scalar - field ( tensor - type gravitational ) perturbations of a @xmath44 black brane .",
    "similar results hold for large black holes .",
    "low-@xmath34 results for @xmath37 are well known in the literature ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) , while the higher - dimensional cases are discussed in details in ref .",
    "@xcite : both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are almost independent on @xmath34 ( or @xmath2 for large black holes ) in this regime . for wavenumbers",
    "@xmath47 , the qualitative behavior changes : @xmath45 grows linearly while @xmath46 decreases with @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , it is also clear from fig . [",
    "fig : sadss ] that both the sub - leading term in @xmath45 and the leading term in @xmath46 scale as a power of @xmath34 ( or @xmath2 ) .",
    "this power can be directly read from the slope of the curves of figure [ fig : sadss ] at large @xmath34 . to investigate this further , we parameterize the numerical results by r_r = q+_rq^-_r , r_i=_iq^-_i , and we extract @xmath48 by least - squares .",

    "<S> using series solutions and time - domain evolutions , we probe the eikonal limit of the gravitational and scalar - field quasinormal modes of large black holes and black branes in anti - de sitter backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> these results are particularly relevant for the ads / cft correspondence , since the eikonal regime is characterized by the existence of long - lived modes which ( presumably ) dominate the decay timescale of the perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm all the main qualitative features of these slowly - damped modes as predicted by festuccia and liu @xcite for the scalar - field ( tensor - type gravitational ) fluctuations . however , quantitatively we find dimensional - dependent correction factors . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the dependence of the qnm frequencies on the horizon radius of the black hole ( brane ) and the angular momentum ( wavenumber ) of vector- and scalar - type gravitational perturbations . </S>"
