    "the @xmath9 - @xmath10 mass difference @xmath11 is an interesting quantity to measure an explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry by the gauge coupling ( @xmath12 ) in the spontaneously broken phase of the chiral symmetry .",
    "it in fact has been a prototype of the mass calculation of pseudo nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons in strong coupling gauge theories such as those in the technicolor theories  @xcite and more recently in the little higgs models  @xcite .",
    "the sign as well as the absolute value of @xmath13 is an important issue ( `` vacuum alignment problem '' ) , since the negative sign would imply that the vacuum would align so as to break spontaneously the gauge symmetry ( @xmath12 in the case of pion ) which explicitly breaks the spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "such a situation never happens in the real - life qcd but may do in other theories .",
    "hence this type of calculation plays a central role of the model buildings .",
    "the first successful calculation of @xmath13  @xcite was done by the current algebra in conjunction with the weinberg spectral function sum rules  @xcite saturated by the @xmath14 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 meson poles .",
    "somewhat more elaborate calculation on this line was done combined with the qcd information  @xcite .",
    "recently , an effective field theory calculation without @xmath8 meson has been successfully done  @xcite , based on the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) model  @xcite at loop level  @xcite and the wilsonian matching  @xcite of the hls model with the qcd ( for reviews of the hls approach , see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the hls model is a little higgs model with two sites and two links ( open moose ) whose locality of theory space forbids quadratic divergence in @xmath13 even without @xmath8 meson .    on the other hand , direct qcd calculation of the @xmath13",
    "has never been done except for the lattice simulation  @xcite .",
    "although the lattice qcd is a powerful method , it is still important to establish alternative qcd - based methods which are more intuitive and less dependent on the power of computers .",
    "such methods will be crucial to the subjects which are difficult to be studied in the framework of the lattice simulation .",
    "most relevant subjects are the dynamical origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking , qcd at finite density , etc .    in this paper , we calculate in the chiral symmetric limit the @xmath13 simultaneously with the the pion decay constant @xmath15 and the qcd @xmath1 parameter  @xcite ( or the gasser - leutwyler parameter @xmath2  @xcite ) within the framework of the the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation and the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation in the the improved ladder approximation .",
    "we note that all these quantities are given by `` generalized '' weinberg spectral function sum rules for the difference between the vector current correlator @xmath3 and the axial - vector current correlator @xmath4 : @xmath16 is given by the weinberg first sum rule , the @xmath1 parameter by the das - mathur - okubo ( dmo ) sum rule  @xcite or the `` zeroth weinberg sum rule '' , and @xmath13 by the das - guralnik - mathur - low - young ( dgmly ) sum rule  @xcite or the `` third weinberg sum rule '' .",
    "we then rewrite them in terms of the current correlators instead of the spectral functions and directly calculate @xmath17 on the same footing as @xmath15 and the qcd @xmath1 parameter through @xmath6 in the _ space - like momentum region_. such correlators are written in terms of the bs amplitudes which are given by solving the _ inhomogeneous _ bs ( ibs ) equation and the sd equation with the improved ladder approximation in the landau gauge both in the _ space - like region_. in contrast to our case , solving the bound state spectra by the homogenous bs equation in the time - like region is usually difficult , since it would need analytic continuation of the running coupling which is not an analytic function .",
    "this kind of method has been extensively used to investigate masses and decay constants of low lying mesons  @xcite in good agreement with the experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "the same method failed to reproduce the qcd @xmath1 parameter consistently with the experiment  @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the qcd @xmath1 parameter is rather sensitive to the infrared ( ir ) cutoff parameter of the qcd running coupling .",
    "we actually reproduce the qcd @xmath1 parameter consistently with the experiment by setting the ir cutoff parameter in the region never investigated in the previous works .",
    "our parameter choice corresponds to taking the qcd scale parameter as @xmath18 , while it was chosen as @xmath19 in the previous results of the decay constants and the masses  @xcite and of the qcd @xmath1 parameter  @xcite , both values being considerably higher than the conventional @xmath20-@xmath21mev obtained in the @xmath22 scheme  @xcite .",
    "this actually corresponds to exploiting the `` scale ambiguity ''  @xcite of @xmath23 in the sd and bs equations recently emphasized by hashimoto and tanabashi  @xcite .",
    "we then show that @xmath0 mass difference @xmath13 is calculated in rough agreement with the experimental value for the same parameter region as that reproducing the qcd @xmath1 parameter and @xmath15 . actually , although infrared dynamics is quite important for determination of @xmath15 and @xmath1 , it is not so important for determination of @xmath13 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath1 are sensitive to the infrared structure of the running coupling , while @xmath13 is not .",
    "we also derive the masses and decay constants of @xmath7 meson and @xmath8 meson by fitting them to the calculated @xmath6 within our method using the pole saturated form of @xmath6 . these quantities",
    "are also compared with experiments , which is another check of the validity of the calculation in the present analysis .",
    "the calculation presented in this paper turns out to be the first example which derives @xmath13 directly from qcd without depending on the lattice simulation .",
    "once we have checked the reliability of such a method in the ordinary qcd ( with three light flavors ) , we may apply it to the mass of pseudo ng bosons and vacuum alignment problem in other strong coupling gauge theories such as the large @xmath24 qcd , walking technicolor , little higgs , hot / dense qcd , etc ..    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : spectral ] we introduce spectral function sum rules : the dmo sum rule or the zeroth weinberg sum rule for @xmath1 parameter , the first weinberg sum rule for @xmath16 , the second weinberg sum rule , and the dgmly sum rule or the third weinberg sum rule for @xmath13 .",
    "we then rewrite them in terms of the current correlators @xmath6 . in section  [ sec : correlator - bs ]",
    "we show how the current correlators are obtained from the bs amplitude which is calculated from the ibs equation in the space - like region . in section  [ sec : ibs ] we introduce the ibs equation and show how to solve it numerically .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] is the main part of this paper : we first show the result of the ibs equation for qcd , and discuss the dependence of @xmath15 , @xmath1 and @xmath13 on the infrared structure of the running coupling .",
    "then we compare them with the experimental values .",
    "we also show results for masses and decay constants of @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons . in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "we give summary and discussions on applications to the large @xmath24 qcd and the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "in this section we introduce the spectral function sum rules , which express the pion decay constant @xmath15 , the qcd @xmath1 parameter and @xmath13 in terms of @xmath6 in the space - like momentum region . here",
    "we consider only the chiral symmetric limit of massless three flavors ( @xmath25 ) , the corrections of the finite quark mass being expected to be small for the quantities we consider .",
    "let us begin with introducing the vector and axial - vector currents as @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the generator of @xmath29 normalized as @xmath30 and we consider @xmath31 . in the chiral symmetric limit the current correlator @xmath32",

    "since the axial - vector current @xmath37 couples to the massless ng boson , the pion , while no massless particles couple to the vector current @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 where @xmath15 is the decay constant of the ng boson @xmath14 defined by @xmath40    using the spectral functions , we can write down the following `` generalized '' weinberg sum rules : @xmath41     & = & \\frac{s}{4\\pi}\\ , ,    \\label{eq : zeroth}\\\\    \\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\frac{ds}{s}\\     \\left [ \\rho_{v}^{(1)}(s ) - \\rho_{a}^{(1)}(s ) \\right ]     & = & f_\\pi^2\\ , ,    \\label{eq : first}\\\\    \\int_{0}^{\\infty } ds\\     \\left [ \\rho_{v}^{(1)}(s ) - \\rho_{a}^{(1)}(s ) \\right ]     & = & 0\\ , ,    \\label{eq : second}\\\\    - \\frac{3 \\alpha_{em}}{4\\pi f_\\pi^2 }     \\int_{0}^{\\infty } ds \\log{s}\\     \\left [ \\rho_{v}^{(1)}(s ) - \\rho_{a}^{(1)}(s ) \\right ]     & = & \\delta m_\\pi^2\\ , ,    \\label{eq : third}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath1 is the qcd @xmath1 parameter  @xcite , which in the case of @xmath42 is related to the gasser - leutwyler parameter @xmath2  @xcite as @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the coupling constant of the electromagnetic interaction , and @xmath13 is the @xmath45 mass difference defined by @xmath46 .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : first ] ) and ( [ eq : second ] ) are the first and second weinberg sum rules  @xcite , respectively , and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zeroth ] ) is the dmo sum rule  @xcite or often called the `` zeroth weinberg sum rule '' .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : third ] ) was derived by das et al .",
    "@xcite and may be called the dgmly sum rule or the `` third weinberg sum rule '' .    of course these relations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zeroth ] ) , ( [ eq : first ] ) , ( [ eq : second ] ) , and ( [ eq : third ] ) make sense only if the integrals converge .",
    "for example , convergence of the second sum rule ( [ eq : second ] ) requires that the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 must satisfy @xmath47\\ \\",
    "\\stackrel { ( q^2 \\rightarrow \\infty ) } { \\longrightarrow}\\ \\ 0\\ , , \\label{eq : convergence}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is related to the space - like momentum as @xmath49 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the current correlators can be calculated by the operator product expansion ( ope ) technique . in the chiral limit",
    ", the form of @xmath50 in the ultraviolet region is estimated as follows  @xcite : @xmath51 up to logarithm .",
    "this means that @xmath50 indeed satisfies the condition ( [ eq : convergence ] ) and the relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : second ] ) makes sense . when the integral in the second sum rule converges , those in the first and zeroth sum rules are also convergent .",
    "now we rewrite the zeroth and the first sum rules in terms of the current correlators as @xmath52 \\right\\vert_{q^2 = 0}\\ , , \\label{eq : s_parameter}\\\\    f_\\pi^2 & = & \\pi_{vv}(0 ) - \\pi_{aa}(0)\\ , , \\label{eq : fpi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and also the third sum rule :  @xcite @xmath53\\ , .",

    "@xcite the pion decay constant @xmath15 and the qcd @xmath1 parameter were calculated by the use of the above formulas .",
    "however , @xmath13 was not calculated so far .",
    "so the calculation presented in this paper turns out to be the first example which derives @xmath13 directly from qcd without depending on the lattice simulation .",
    "moreover , there is another interest regarding @xmath13 related to the structure of the qcd vacuum , as we stressed in the introduction .",
    "when we switch off the electromagnetic interaction and set masses of quarks to be zero , pions are identified with the exact ng bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of @xmath54 chiral symmetry down to @xmath55 symmetry .",
    "the existence of the electromagnetic interaction explicitly breaks the @xmath54 chiral symmetry , which makes @xmath9 and @xmath56 be the pseudo ng bosons . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath10 remains massless since the photon does not interact with @xmath10 .",
    "the interesting point here is whether @xmath46 ( @xmath57 in the chiral limit ) becomes positive or negative , which is called `` vacuum alignment problem '' .",
    "negative @xmath13 means that fluctuation of @xmath9 field around @xmath58 is unstable and the vacuum with @xmath58 is not a true vacuum .",
    "if this is the case , @xmath9 has non - zero vacuum expectation value and @xmath12 symmetry is broken .",
    "we know that , in the real world , @xmath13 is positive and the vacuum with @xmath58 is the true vacuum .",
    "@xmath12 symmetry is not broken in the real world .",
    "this is quite nontrivial fact resulting from the nonperturbative dynamics of the strong interaction .",
    "so it is interesting to investigate whether we can reproduce positive @xmath13 which is realized in the real - life qcd .",
    "in the previous section we have written down the qcd @xmath1 parameter , @xmath15 , and @xmath13 in terms of the current correlators . then , in this section , we show how the current correlators are obtained from the bs amplitude which will be calculated from the ibs equation .    to derive properties of hadrons as boundstates , it is straightforward to perform calculations directly in the time - like momentum region . however , it is difficult to solve the bs equation and the sd equation in the time - like region since we have to carry out the analytic continuation of the running coupling from the space - like region to the time - like region . in the case of qcd ,",
    "the one - loop running coupling is not an analytic function , so that we have to approximate it by some analytic function in order to perform the calculations in the time - like region .",

    "in other words , @xmath50 is sensitive to the infrared structure of the qcd running coupling .",
    "once we obtain @xmath50 , we can calculate the qcd @xmath1 parameter , @xmath15 and @xmath13 by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s_parameter ] ) , ( [ eq : fpi ] ) and ( [ eq : mass_diff ] ) . in table",
    "[ tab : dimensionless ] , we list the resultant values of these quantities for several values of @xmath144 . here , we normalized dimensionfull quantities by @xmath159 , and expressed them as dimensionless quantities .",
    ".resultant values of the qcd @xmath1 parameter , @xmath15 and @xmath160 for several values of @xmath144 .",
    "dimensionfull quantities are normalized by @xmath159 and expressed as dimensionless quantities . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     resultant best fitted values",
    "are listed in table  [ tab : results-2 ] together with the experimental values . from the results shown in this table",
    ", we can see that the masses and the decay constants of @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons are not so much dependent on the infrared cutoff parameter @xmath144 compared with @xmath144 dependence of @xmath13 and @xmath1 .",
    "when we choose @xmath149 , for which the values of @xmath13 and @xmath1 are predicted in good agreement with experiments , we obtained @xmath161 these are also in good agreement with experiments .",
    "this confirms the reliability of calculations in the present analysis based on the improved ladder bs equation with small infrared cutoff parameter ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath45 mass difference @xmath13 on the same footing as the pion decay constant @xmath15 and the qcd @xmath1 parameter through the vector and the axial - vector current correlators . for the calculations we solved inhomogeneous bs equations for the vector and axial - vector vertex functions together with sd equation for the quark mass function within the improved ladder approximation in the landau gauge .",
    "we also obtained the masses and the decay constants of @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons by fitting them to @xmath50 using the pole saturated form .",
    "we showed that all of these quantities are simultaneously fit in agreement with the experiments when we take the ir cutoff parameter @xmath163 , which corresponds to taking @xmath164 this parameter choice of @xmath144 is fairly smaller than the ones investigated in the previous works  @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath165 either value of @xmath23 above is substantially larger than that in the @xmath22 scheme  @xcite : @xmath166 our results imply that the running coupling of qcd in the ir region should be taken larger than that considered so far , when we calculate not only @xmath15 but also the qcd @xmath1 parameter and @xmath13 in the framework of the bs and the sd equations in the improved ladder approximation .",
    "apparently , choosing the ir cutoff parameter corresponds to exploiting the `` scale ambiguity ''  @xcite of @xmath23 in the sd and bs equations as was recently emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite which proposed an interesting method to resolve the scale ambiguity in the the calculation of @xmath15 .    in order to establish the approach of the sd and the bs equations in the improved ladder approximation , it is certainly desirable to apply the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to our case , namely the calculations of @xmath13 and qcd @xmath1 parameter as well as @xmath15 . this will be done in future work .",
    "the success of the analysis based on the bs and the sd equations in the real - life qcd in this paper well motivate us to apply this method for studies of other strong coupling gauge theories .",
    "one of the most interesting examples of such is the large @xmath24 qcd ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which is a qcd with large number of massless flavors ( but not too large number as to destroy the asymptotic freedom ) .",
    "it is expected that the chiral symmetry gets restored for a certain large number of massless flavors , which was in fact confirmed by the lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "it was argued  @xcite based on the effective field theory of hls  @xcite that this chiral restoration of the large @xmath24 qcd is accompanied by the massless vector meson degenerate with the ng boson ( pseudoscalar meson ) as the chiral partners ( `` vector manifestation '' of chiral symmetry ) .",
    "it was further argued  @xcite that the hls model even in the real - life qcd behaves as a little higgs model  @xcite with two sites and two links , whose locality of theory space forbids the quadratic divergence in @xmath13 which is nothing but the @xmath167 of the higgs in the framework of the little higgs models . in the large @xmath24 qcd @xmath13",
    "becomes small compared with @xmath16 near the chiral restoration point , which may suggest that the large @xmath24 qcd may be considered as a uv completion of the little higgs model",
    ".    on the other hand , we found in the previous paper  @xcite , by the explicit calculation based on the homogeneous bs and the sd equations in the improved ladder approximation , that masses of the scalar , vector , and axial - vector mesons in the large @xmath24 qcd are proportional to @xmath15 and vanish at the chiral restoration point , which implies somewhat different manifestation than the vector manifestation in the hls model .",
    "( this behavior was also conjectured in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "thus it would be very useful to clarify the situation to calculate the @xmath1 parameter and @xmath13 in large @xmath24 qcd which have not yet been calculated directly from qcd . in the forthcoming paper",
    "we shall calculate @xmath13 and @xmath1 parameter in large @xmath24 qcd by the same method presented in this paper .",
