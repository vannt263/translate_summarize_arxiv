    "consider a measurement in which the current coming out of a mesoscopic sample is filtered around a frequency @xmath0 , then amplified , measured , squared , then this process is repeated many times and the results are averaged .",
    "the final result of such a procedure is called the _ current fluctuations _ , the _ power spectrum _ , or the _ current noise _ , at frequency @xmath1 .",
    "often , two such measurements are performed on the same system : the first while it is driven out of equilibrium ( e.g. , by applying a dc voltage @xcite or electromagnetic radiation @xcite to it ) and the second in equilibrium ( the voltage source is turned off , i.e. , the power supply becomes a short ) .",
    "the _ excess noise _ is defined as the difference in the noise between the first and the second measurement .",
    "the present work analyzes what quantity one should calculate in order to predict excess noise .    in the rest of the introduction",
    "some basic concepts in amplification theory are introduced . in sec .",
    "[ sec noise measur proc ] the measurement procedure is defined . in sec .",
    "[ sec which quant is meas class ] we analyze the classical case and in sections [ sec which quant is meas quant ] and [ sec excess quan noise meas ] the quantum one - when @xmath2 is comparable with or larger than the temperature , the voltage , or the rf radiation frequency applied to the sample .",
    "finally , a possible verification of the results is presented .",
    "our main result can be stated as follows .",
    "the result of a noise measurement depends on the particular instrumentation used in the setup - what type of amplifier and detector are used , what are their temperatures , etc .",
    "it is generally , and usually , neither the fourier transform of the current correlator in the sample , nor its symmetrized version .",
    "however , the _ excess _ noise is instrumentation - independent , and is equal to the amplifier - gain squared times the difference in the fourier transform of the current correlator , in and out of equilibrium .",
    "this difference has a clear physical meaning : it is the difference in the power emitted _ from _ the sample and _ into _ the filter , in and out of equilibrium .",
    "a real ( and well behaved ) function , @xmath3 , can be fourier - represented as : @xmath4.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 if @xmath6 is negligible outside a narrow bandwidth @xmath7 around a center frequency @xmath8 , @xmath9 , then it is useful to write @xmath3 in the form @xcite : @xmath10 where are @xmath11 and @xmath12 are real and slowly varying - they have fourier - components only at frequencies smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are called the _ cosine _ and _ sine _ components of @xmath3 . defining the time average of @xmath13 as : @xmath14 then ( if @xmath9 ) eq . ( [ it cos + sin ] ) implies : @xmath15 in a _ stationary state _ , the choice of the origin of time does not affect average quantities and therefore using and eq .",
    "( [ it cos + sin ] ) for @xmath16 and @xmath17 one gets : @xmath18 moreover , in a stationary state time averaging may be replaced by averaging over realizations .",
    "we choose these realizations as repeated measurement on the same system at @xmath19 different times , @xmath20 , which are distributed over a whole time interval , @xmath21 , which is longer than other time scales in the systems : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ( in practice , usually the largest time is @xmath25 and therefore it is enough to require that the measurements are distributed over a time interval longer than it . ) .",
    "thus , we can replace the time average : @xmath26      below , we shall consider only _ linear _ amplifiers .",
    "an amplifier is linear if the current coming out of it , @xmath27 , is related to the one entering it , @xmath28 by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the cosine and sine components of @xmath32 and where at least one of the numbers @xmath33 and @xmath34 is large .",
    "if @xmath35 the amplifier is called _ phase - insensitive_. a phase insensitive amplifier does what one would naively expect from an amplifier - it just multiplies the incoming signal by a large number . if @xmath36 the amplifier is called _ phase sensitive _ and it affects the two components of the incoming signal differently .",
    "an important special case is when @xmath37 @xmath38 where the amplifier amplifies only one of the components while disposing of the other .",
    "phase sensitive and insensitive amplifiers have similar classical behaviors , but may have different technical advantages .",
    "however , when quantum effects are important they differ fundamentally due to the limitations heisenberg principle puts on them - see ref . [ 4 ] and the appendix .    in noise measurement in mesoscopic systems phase",
    "insensitive amplifiers are commonly used ( e.g. , in setups that include a field effect transistor ) but we consider below also the phase sensitive case such as the degenerate parametric amplifiers @xcite because their quite developed technology ( that was used , for example , in order to enable sensitive detection in experimental gravitational physics @xcite ) seems to be less familiar in the mesoscopic community and also in order to demonstrate the universality of our result .",
    "in a typical noise measurement ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) at frequency @xmath1 the current @xmath39 that flows out of the sample ( which is assumed to be in a stationary state , but not necessarily in equilibrium , ) is filtered with an rlc circuit around a resonance frequency @xmath40 .",
    "the current coming out of the filter , @xmath41 , is amplified , measured at some arbitrary time point , @xmath42 , and the result of this measurement , @xmath27 , is squared ( say , by a square law detector ) .",
    "this measurement is then repeated at @xmath19 different times , @xmath43 , and the results are averaged and divided by the filter bandwidth , @xmath7 , giving a number which we shall denote by @xmath44 , @xmath45 finally , a voltage proportional to @xmath46 is sent out to drive a display .    the explanation for why the above measurement is , at least in the classical case , a measurement of the current spectrum is given in the next section",
    ". meanwhile we make the following comments :    \\1 .",
    "the above procedure is not a measurement of a function of time .",
    "it is merely a series of _ independent _ samplings of a stationary process .",
    "though many setups perform these samplings at times which are separated by a _ constant _ time interval , we stress that this is _ not _ essential ( and actually may create confusion ) : the result will be the same even if the measurement is performed at _ random times _ as explained below eq .",
    "( [ time average i2 ic2 is2 statinary st ] ) ) .    \\2 . in some setups",
    "it is convenient to convert the signal to a low - frequency one and measure only the sine or cosine components , for example , by mixing the signal with a local oscillator ( as is done in heterodyne and homodyne detection ) , that is , multiplying it by a pure sine or a cosine and averaging the result over time before squaring it .",
    "such a mixing may introduce additional noise that should be taken into account .",
    "numerical factors that may multiply the signal as a result of such a procedure are then cancelled by , e.g. , calibration of the setup with respect to a source of noise with a known power spectrum such as a resistor in thermal equilibrium .    if the system , the filter and the amplifier are all in a stationary state , then according to eq .",
    "( [ time average i2 ic2 is2 statinary st ] ) such a procedure yields the same @xmath44 as in the case of measuring and squaring the whole signal .",
    "we shall always assume that the sample and the filter are in a stationary state , but we shall not necessarily assume that this is the case for the amplifier .",
    "it is typically the case for semiconductor amplifiers such as the field effect transistors used in noise measurement in mesoscopic systems but it is _ not _ the case in several types of parametric amplifiers @xcite .      in an excess noise measurement one subtracts the noise measured when the system is in equilibrium from that which is measured when the same system is driven out of equilibrium : @xmath47 the excess noise is useful when one is interested in looking into the changes in the system which are due to driving it out of equilibrium .",
    "it is also useful when a particular setup ( amplifier temperature and type , etc ) affects the measurement by introducing an _ additional _ noise which is independent of the sample state , so by taking the difference between the two noise powers one can get rid of the instrumentation - dependent noise power .",
    "equilibrium properties , can not be described by the excess noise since by definition it vanishes in equilibrium .    since in most cases",
    "mesoscopic samples are driven out of equilibrium by an external dc voltage , @xmath48 , we shall consider the quantity : @xmath49 however , other means ( e.g. , by application of external radiation @xcite,@xcite ) can be used to drive the system out of equilibrium .",
    "what quantity should one calculate in order to predict @xmath50 ?",
    "will this quantity depend on the properties of the sample only , or also on the particular experimental setup ?    to answer these questions",
    "we first consider the classical case .",
    "consider a current @xmath3 flowing in a system which is in a stationary state . consider a long time interval @xmath51 and define the _ restricted fourier transform _ of @xmath3 , @xmath52 the _ power spectrum _ of @xmath3 , @xmath53 and the _ correlator _ of @xmath3 , @xmath54 the wiener - khinchin theorem @xcite states that @xmath55 @xmath56 and specifically also that , @xmath57    by its definition , a filter greatly reduces the fourier components at frequencies further than a band width @xmath7 away from its center frequency , @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , assuming a regular behavior of @xmath58 , and a small @xmath7 , the restricted transform of the current coming out of that filter , @xmath59 is related to that of the incoming current , @xmath58 , by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is constant .",
    "an example of a filter is shown in fig .",
    "2 . for the moment we do not consider the possibility that the filter adds its own thermal noise to @xmath41 .",
    "thus , according to their definitions , the power spectrum of @xmath41 and @xmath39 are related by : @xmath62    applying eq .",
    "( [ c0=int sw ] ) to @xmath41 , eq . ( [ weiner khinchine ] ) to @xmath39 , and using eq .",
    "( [ smw sw rectangular relation ] ) one gets @xmath63 eq .",
    "( [ c0=jj ] ) clarifies what might be a confusing feature of a noise measurement with a filter : taking the square of the current coming out of the filter at one time yields information on the correlation in the current in the sample at two different times .",
    "the average energy stored in an rlc filter is @xcite : @xmath64 for later purposes we note that this equation is valid also in a stationary quantum state as a consequence of the virial theorem @xcite .",
    "since , for the moment , the amplification stage is ignored we have @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , making use of the definition of the measured noise , eq .",
    "( [ smw defined ] ) , we see that @xmath66          we proceed now to include the amplification stage . in order to avoid complications due to the differences between different types of amplifiers we assume here that only the cosine component of the output current , @xmath67 is measured , squared and averaged . such an assumption enables us to assign a single gain , @xmath68 , to the amplifier ( whether it is phase sensitive or not ) that multiplies the incoming signal .",
    "thus , @xmath41 enters the amplifier and @xmath27 comes out of it .",
    "then , the component @xmath69 is measured and squared . but @xmath70 and therefore by eqs .",
    "( [ c0=jj])-([what is measured classicaly ] ) one has : @xmath71 where @xmath72      even when considered classically , the measurement setup can perform according to eq .",
    "( [ lin ampl defined ] ) and ( [ what is measured classicaly with ampl ] ) only as long as its components are operating at temperatures which are low compared with the signal power spectrum . at higher temperatures , one should take into account the thermal noise , @xmath73 produced by these components and add it to the output signal .",
    "we shall not discuss the particular form of this noise , except for mentioning that in equilibrium and at low frequencies its contribution is @xmath74 ( the nyquist - johnson noise ) times the amplifier - gain squared , and that it is independent of the input , i.e. , of the state of the sample .",
    "thus , we write : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is defined as the noise measured with no input .",
    "comments :    \\1 .",
    "other types of noise such ( e.g. , @xmath77 noise ) may occur inside the setup components .",
    "however , unlike the noise required by thermodynamics ( and in the quantum case also that required by the heisenberg principle ) , these may in principle be eliminated and thus are not considered here .",
    "\\2 . adding a setup noise which is assumed to be independent of the input ,",
    "is justified by assuming that the statistical distributions of the state of the total system is a product of that of the amplifier ( and the detector ) and the filter+sample and that the coupling between those parts is weak . in the quantum case",
    "the assumption is that the density matrix of the system is a product of that of the amplifier ( and the detector ) and the sample+filter . for more details",
    "see the appendix .      according to eqs .",
    "( [ excess noise v defined ] ) , ( [ what is measured class+ampl + therm noise ] ) , the excess noise in a classical measurement is : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the differences in the filter energies and the correlators in and out of equilibrium .",
    "( [ what is measured class+ampl + therm noise ] ) and ( [ measured excess classicaly + therm noise ] ) tell us what are the measured quantities in noise and excess noise measurements in classical situations , i.e. , when quantum effects can be neglected .",
    "they show that although the measured noise , eq .",
    "( [ what is measured class+ampl + therm noise ] ) , is setup - dependent because the term @xmath76 depends on the setup type and temperature , the measured excess noise is not .",
    "( [ measured excess classicaly + therm noise ] ) also gives a simple physical picture to the excess noise : when a voltage is applied to the sample and drives it out of equilibrium , the current ( or charge ) fluctuations in the sample change ( typically , they increase ) , and interact with the charges or currents in the rlc circuit ( e.g. , through capacitive or inductive coupling ) causing an increase in the energy flow from the sample into the circuit in a similar way to that in which the current fluctuations in an antenna of a classical transmitter emit energy into a receiver ( fig .",
    "2 ) . part of this energy is accumulated in the capacitor and the inductor and part is dissipated in the resistor .",
    "eventually the system arrives at a stationary ( though not an equilibrium ) state where the filter energy is higher than before .",
    "the measured excess noise is simply this increase in the filter energy multiplied by the amplifier gain .",
    "having obtained a detailed picture of the classical noise measurement we are now ready to analyze the quantum case .",
    "when the measured frequency is higher than the temperature of the sample or the setup , quantum effects become important . one may then consider replacing the current @xmath81 and the average over realizations @xmath82 in eqs .",
    "( [ what is measured class+ampl + therm noise ] ) and ( [ measured excess classicaly + therm noise ] ) by , respectively , the heisenberg current operator of the electrons in the sample , @xmath83 and the expectation value of the product of operators , @xmath84 in the quantum stationary state of the system . however , in attempting to do so one immediately encounters the following two questions ( which are answered below ) :    \\1 .",
    "the current operator does not commute with itself at different times ( the product @xmath85 is not hermitian ) and therefore it is not clear in which order , @xmath85 or @xmath86 the product should be written or whether it should be replaced by its _ symmetrized _",
    "version @xmath87 ( which is hermitian ) as is customarily suggested in text books @xcite .",
    "what are the properties of the setup noise ( the analog @xmath76 ) in the quantum case , and specifically , does it vanish in the limit of zero temperature as was the case in the classical regime ?",
    "consider first a mesoscopic system , e.g. , a ballistic quantum point contact between two ohmic contacts , in which a dc voltage is applied to the left contact and the current flowing out of the right one interacts with the current in an rlc circuit ( modelled by an harmonic oscillator with a small damping ) through an inductive coupling of the form ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : @xmath88 the above system was considered in refs . @xcite and @xcite ( in the limit of small @xmath89 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "it was shown , that as a result of this interaction there is an energy flow between the electronic system and the filter .",
    "the current fluctuations in the electronic system excite the harmonic modes of the filter in a similar way to that in which current fluctuations in an antenna excite the photon modes in the electromagnetic field of the vacuum . as a result of switching the _ interaction _ on adiabatically while keeping the dc voltage constant , ( unlike what is considered above where the _ voltage _ is switched on )",
    ", the energy of the filter was found to increase by an amount of @xcite-@xcite : @xmath90=   \\gamma^2 \\left [ s_j(\\omega)-2 n \\hbar \\omega g_d(\\omega)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the transform of the _ nonsymmetrized _ quantum correlator , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the average number of quanta in the oscillator , and @xmath94 is the differential conductance @xcite .",
    "@xmath95 is equal to @xmath96 times some multiplicative factors ( which anyhow cancel in the setup calibration ) .",
    "@xmath91 has a physical meaning : it is proportional to the fermi - golden rule emission - rate of quanta of @xmath97 from the sample into the filter @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath98 is proportional to the absorption rate .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ delta ef lc ] ) has a simple physical meaning : the change in the filter energy correspond to the spontaneous emission from the sample plus the net energy flow due to the difference between the induced emission and absorption .    in order to obtain the change in the filter energy due to the application of the voltage",
    ", one has to calculate the difference between finite and zero voltage : @xmath99 .",
    "one obtains : @xmath100 where it was assumed that the voltage - dependence of the differential conductance is weak .",
    "( [ ef excess quantum ] ) expresses the change in the filter energy when the sample is in and out of equilibrium .",
    "we are now ready to proceed to the final step and take the amplification into account .",
    "consider the current @xmath101 in an rlc circuit which serves as the input signal of a linear amplifier .",
    "the quantum theory of linear amplifiers @xcite specifies what limitations the heisenberg principle puts on their performances .",
    "the limitations relevant to our case can be summarized as follows :    an amplifier that amplifies both sine and cosine components of the input signal _ must _ add noise , which we will denote by @xmath102 , to the measured signal , and this noise does not vanish at zero temperature .",
    "therefore , a phase insensitive amplifier must add noise to the measured signal . however , the added noise is not necessarily distributed evenly between the two components .",
    "the amount of noise which is added , say , to the cosine component , depends on the particular amplification setup and temperature .",
    "the fluctuation of the current coming out of a phase insensitive amplifier are given by the form @xcite : @xmath103 where @xmath102 depends only on the properties and state of the amplifier and detector while @xmath104 depends only on those of the filter .",
    "similarly , the fluctuation of the current coming out of a phase sensitive amplifier ( which can be , ideally , noiseless and which amplifies only the cosine component and disposes of the sine component ) are given by the form : @xmath105 a brief review on the origin of the additive form of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ia2 ] ) is given in the appendix .",
    "since the filter is in a stationary state , one has @xmath106 and therefore , eqs .",
    "( [ ef ] ) , ( [ ia2 ] ) and ( [ iac2 ] ) yield : @xmath107    eqs .",
    "( [ ef excess quantum ] ) and ( [ sm quantum ] ) imply @xmath108 where @xmath72    eq . ( [ sm excess quantum ] ) is our main result .",
    "it shows that in order to predict the result of an excess noise measurement one should calculate the correlators ( no symmetrization is required ) in and out of equilibrium and take the difference between them .",
    "it also shows that there will be no contribution from the zero - point fluctuations since @xmath109 ( the _ emission _ spectrum ) does not contain such contribution - the zero point fluctuations can not emit energy .",
    "when the @xmath110 ( but not necessarily the setup ) is at zero temperature the correlator vanishes in equilibrium since the sample can not emit anything .",
    "therefore : @xmath111    we note that the equality in eq .",
    "( [ sm excess quantum ] ) is not term - by - term .",
    "the excess noise is equal to the excess of the correlator but the noise by itself is not equal to the correlator by itself since according to eq .",
    "( [ ia2 ] ) the former depends also on the setup properties while the latter depends only on the sample properties .    the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ sm excess quantum ] ) is valid for all linear amplifiers used in noise measurements in mesoscopic systems and the parametric ones which are analyzed in ref .",
    "the condition that the conductance @xmath112 remains constant when the dc voltage is turned on , that was used in deriving this equation , may be understood by considering the zero temperature case : the excess noise is the power flow of energy from the sample into the filter . in order to enable an efficient measurement of this power an impedance matching is needed between the sample , the transmission lines and the filter . if the sample conductance is very different in its equilibrium and nonequilibrium states , then , initially good impedance - matching with the detector that enables an efficient power flow in equilibrium , means a bad impedance matching out of equilibrium with an inefficient power flow .",
    "in such a case one should correct eq .",
    "( [ sm excess quantum ] ) by taking into account the different impedance ratios in and out of equilibrium .",
    "a straightforward way to verify eq .",
    "( [ sm excess quantum t=0 ] ) is to measure the excess noise in a single - channel ballistic quantum point contact at high frequencies , @xmath113 for such a system the nonsymmetrized correlator is given by ( see ref . [ 14 ] for the symmetrized version , and [ 15 ] and [ 13 ] for the nonsymmetrized one ) : @xmath114 where @xmath115 , @xmath116 is the sample temperature and @xmath117 is the transmission of the channel .",
    "according to our theory , such an excess noise measurement would yield @xmath118 for any amplifier type or temperature , while without taking the excess the result will generally depend substantially on type of the setup and its temperature .",
    "in particular , for @xmath119 , the excess noise measurement will yield @xmath120 , i.e. , the nonsymmetrized correlator ( with no contribution from the zero point fluctuations ) while without taking the excess the result will generally differ from both the non - symmetrized and the symmetrized correlators and will depend on the particular setup .",
    "consider an rlc circuit ( see e.g. , fig .",
    "2 ) , which we shall call the input , connected into a linear amplifier . let @xmath121 be the heisenberg operator of the current in the input . this operator acts on the degrees of freedom of the circuit and therefore its expectation values are determined when the circuit state is given .",
    "let @xmath122 be the heisenberg operator of the current at the output port of the amplifier .",
    "in general , this operator acts on both the input and the amplifier degrees of freedom . for an ideal linear amplifier : @xmath123 note that in such an ideal case the output operator , @xmath124 , acts only on the degrees of freedom of the input ( and not any of the setup ) - the input state determines completely the output independently of the amplifier state .",
    "however , the heisenberg principle limits on the possibility of realizing such a device : it requires the sine and the cosine components to obey a minimum uncertainty relation ( see eq .",
    "( 2.19 ) in ref . [ 4 ] ) .",
    "suppose one constructs a minimum - uncertainty state for @xmath125 and @xmath126 so that they can be measured simultaneously at the maximum accuracy permitted without violating the heisenberg principle . if @xmath127 ( as is the case for a phase insensitive amplifier where @xmath128 ) then @xmath129 and @xmath130 could have been measured simultaneously up to an accuracy which is @xmath131 times better than allowed simply by measuring @xmath125 and @xmath126 and then applying eq . ( [ lin ampl ideal quantum ] ) . therefore , an amplifier with @xmath127 and specifically a phase insensitive amplifier is forbidden in quantum mechanics .",
    "one way to overcome these limitations is to build an amplifier in which , for example , @xmath132 that is , a phase sensitive amplifier that amplifies the cosine component and diminishes the sine component so that in the limit of @xmath133 we can write : @xmath134 an example for such a device is the degenerate parametric amplifier @xcite . another way to overcome the above limitations is to allow @xmath135 ( and in particular @xmath136 ) but add to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lin ampl ideal quantum ] ) an additional term that will operates on the amplifier degrees of freedom so that : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is an operator acting on the amplifier degrees of freedom such as the electronic state in a field effect transistor or the idler resistor state in a non - degenerate parametric amplifier .",
