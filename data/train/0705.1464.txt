    "solar prominences have been observed since the invention of the spectrohelioscope and as an example one can see well - known h@xmath1 drawings by @xcite ( one can be found in the textbook of @xcite ) . although these pioneering observations were rather simple ,",
    "they already indicate that prominences consist of many complicated structures having seemingly chaotic behaviour .",
    "prominence fine structures have then been frequently observed with better and better resolution , reaching today a hundred of  km .",
    "however , although the fine structure was known , the prominences have been modeled for decades _ as a whole _ , using simplified one - dimensional ( 1d ) slab models .",
    "their magneto - hydrostatic ( mhs ) structure was first derived by @xcite ( hereafter referred to as ks - model ) and their radiative properties were studied in a 1d - slab approximation by many authors .",
    "such models reproduced rather well the spectral properties of prominences as observed with lower resolution . the aim of this review is to discuss various aspects of current investigations of prominence fine structures .",
    "this topic was thoroughly reviewed by @xcite , while @xcite summarized the latest observational results achieved with the highest resolution .",

    "[ ph - fig5 ] from @xcite .",
    "these authors have studied the same filament as @xcite .",
    "spectral diagnostics of prominence fine structures is a difficult task for several reasons .",
    "first , one has to distinguish between optically - thin and optically - thick fine structures . in the former case",
    "several fine - structure elements ( fse ) are seen along the line of sight and their radiation output is thus integrated . on the other hand , in case of thick structures , we mostly see only one fse , most probably located closer to the border of a prominence rather than in its central parts .",
    "the situation is actually more complex , because an optically - thick fse is thick in the line core but becomes thin in the line wings , where we again see many fse along the line of sight .",
    "this situation largely complicates the analysis of spectral data .",
    "second reason is that , as already mentioned above , fse are highly dynamical and thus any multi - wavelength observation has to be made simultaneously or at least quasi - simultaneously ( this means within time shorter than the life - time of the fse ) in all wavelength bands of interest .",
    "another complication arises from the lack of our detailed knowledge about the internal structure of fse and their distributions within a prominence  even their elementary geometry is subject of a controversial debate ( vertical threads , horizotal fibrils with flows , blobs etc . ) . for spectroscopic work ,",
    "two basic models are usually considered : ( i ) each fse has its own prominence - corona transition region ( pctr ) , its 3d shape will then depend on the magnetic field threading the fse because of principally different thermal conductivity along and across the field lines , ( ii ) fse are more - or - less isothermal , but their temperature increases towards the prominence boundaries and this forms another kind of pctr on a larger scale .",
    "a combination of ( i ) and ( ii ) is also possible . for further details and references",
    "see the review by @xcite and his recent summary at the soho-17 workshop @xcite .",
    "the scenario ( i ) was corroborated by various authors , while the second one ( ii ) was suggested e.g. , by @xcite who analyzed the spectral data from smm / uvsp . here",
    "it is worth mentioning that the scenario ( ii ) allows one to use a 1d slab model with a relevant pctr on each side as a first approximation ( see @xcite ) , while the effect of a fine - structure pctr ( case ( i ) ) has to be modeled by considering a superposition of several fse ( each of them , however , can be again modeled by a simple 1d slab which describes , contrary to ( ii ) , only one fse ) ",
    "see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "finally , a principal difficulty in our understanding of the thermodynamical properties of prominence plasmas comes from the nature of radiation processes involved .",
    "the prominence spectral lines are mostly formed , namely in cooler parts , by the scattering of the incident radiation coming from the solar surface ( photosphere , chromosphere , or even pctr , depending on the spectral line under consideration ) .",
    "this leads to strong departures from lte and thus the non - lte theory of radiative transfer must be applied to prominences and filaments .",
    "this is known for a long time , here we can mention pioneering works by @xcite , by an hao group in the seventies ( see @xcite and references therein ) or by kiev groups ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for a recent summary of modern non - lte techniques",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the use of these transfer methods for 1d slabs is almost routine today and several 1d non - lte codes do exist : the ias code @xcite , the ondejov code @xcite , pandora is now also being modified to prominence slabs @xcite .",
    "2d slab models were considered first by @xcite using the mam code of @xcite , then by @xcite and @xcite and finally by @xcite .",
    "all these codes can be or have been used to model either the prominence or filament as a whole ( note : for prominences one uses slabs standing vertically above the solar surface , while in case of filaments the slabs are horizontal , i.e. , parallel to the solar surface ) or individual fse .",
    "however , in case of several fse , the situation becomes much more complex because of their mutual radiative interaction .",
    "this was treated in simplified ways by @xcite and by @xcite , but in most other cases the radiative interaction was neglected , all fse were considered the be identical ( as 1d slabs ) and simply superimposed along the line of sight ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this interaction could , however , be tackled using todays high - performance parallel machines .    in the above summary we have tried to give the reader an idea how complex the spectral diagnostics of prominence fine structure is .",
    "however , we still completely neglected the dynamics or temporal variations of thermodynamic properties .",
    "the actual values of thermodynamic parameters like the kinetic temperature ( @xmath6 ) , gas pressure ( @xmath7 ) , plasma density ( @xmath8 ) , electron density ( @xmath9 ) , but also the number of fse along the line of sight or their geometrical dimensions , derived from prominence / filament spectra , have been summarized e.g. , by @xcite , @xcite or recently , using soho / sumer data , by @xcite .",
    "one approach is to study in detail the properties at a given prominence location , where we see  as discussed above ",
    "one or more fse along the line of sight , or to perform a statistical analysis of the raster data to get the information about a global distribution of such parameters . here",
    "we can mention the recent work by @xcite ( see also @xcite on p.  291ff in this volume ) , where the line ratio technique ( hed@xmath10 over h@xmath0 ) was used .",
    "the results based on high - resolution filtrograms taken on vtt at tenerife do indicate distinct situations : the case when for example the gas pressure would be almost constant over the prominence region ( see also @xcite ) is of a particular interest since it indicates an almost linear decrease of the magnetic field intensity with height and a statistical homogeneity of the spatial distribution of fse .      a few months before this coimbra meeting solar physicists celebrated 10 years of successful observations with the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) , which is a joint esa / nasa mission ( see proceedings from soho 17 workshop held in sicily , may 2006 ",
    "esa sp-617 ) . during this period ,",
    "soho was frequently used to observe solar prominences and filaments in uv and euv spectral bands .",
    "in particular sumer and cds spectrometers provided us with a wealth of unique data .",
    "the use of sumer for prominence physics was reviewed by @xcite , prominence spectroscopy with sumer was also summarized by @xcite . concerning the prominence fine structure , @xcite and @xcite have studied the behaviour of lines formed in pctr , while @xcite give a summary of their work on the hydrogen lyman spectrum .",
    "the lyman lines of hydrogen were also studied by @xcite .",
    "finally , let us mention that @xcite and @xcite have produced an atlas of the prominence euv spectrum observed by soho / sumer .",
    "magnetic fields in solar prominences were measured since several decades , using first the zeeman technique and later on the hanle effect .",
    "this is summarized in the review by @xcite on p.  291ff in this volume .",
    "older polarimetric observations made with the coronagraph led , in the case of quiescent prominences , to magnetic fields typically below 20  g. for latitudes larger than 35@xmath11 one obtains a mean value of @xmath12 equal to 8  g , while at lower latitudes the mean field is around 10  g @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed data for a large number of polar - crown filaments and found @xmath12 in the range 2  15  g , while @xcite arrived at values 6  27  g for a sample of 13 prominences ( however , they did nt distinguish between quiescent and eruptive prominences ) .",
    "practically all these measurements have indicated the predominance of horizontal fields which naturally posses the question why the fine - structure threads appear quasi - vertical and not aligned along the field lines like the magnetic flux - tubes @xcite .",
    "more recent measurements seem to indicate higher fields , reaching values of a few tens of gauss ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the respective observations concern only a rather restricted sample of prominences which may not always be of a quiescent type or are restricted to low parts of prominences ( including their feets ) .",
    "higher fields also follow from the analysis of the stokes @xmath13  signal which was not used in earlier studies .",
    "the actual intensity of the magnetic field is critical for our understanding of the prominence support and we will discuss this in the next section .",
    "since the fine - structure magnetic fields have not yet been detected ( not because of lack of the spatial resolution , but due to still a low signal - to - noise ratio in polarimetric signals ) , most of our current knowledge or ideas come from data - driven modeling . either one can use the detailed distribution of surface magnetic fields ( like the soho / mdi maps ) and perform coronal extrapolations of various degrees of sophistication ( see review by @xcite in this volume ) , or use indirect spectroscopic methods and modeling to infer the fine structure of the magnetic field ( like that suggested in @xcite and recently used in @xcite ) . here we are mainly interested in the topology of the field inside and in the surroundings of fse ( for a recent summary see also @xcite ) .",
    "two different magnetic configurations are considered in relation to prominence fine structures .",
    "the first one , also discussed by @xcite , is based on the assumption that the plasma-@xmath0 ( ratio of gas to magnetic pressure ) is always very low , of the order of 10@xmath14 or lower . in that case , the plasma itself has negligible effect on the topology of magnetic fields related to fse .",
    "if , however , the plasma-@xmath0 is larger , of the order of 0.1  1.0 or even higher , the weight of the plasma will produce what we call `` gravity - induced magnetic dips '' .",
    "let us discuss these two situations in more detail ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the topology of the prominence magnetic fields at low @xmath0 is discussed by @xcite on p.  291ff so that we give only a brief overview here .",
    "today various authors try to model the prominence magnetic field by linear or non - linear force - free - field ( `` fff '' ) extrapolations of the measured photospheric field .",
    "@xcite show that the prominence may consist of many rather shallow magnetic dips which can be filled by the cool material visible e.g. , in the h@xmath1 line .",
    "the presence of such dips was further demonstrated by @xcite and by @xcite . in the latter paper",
    "the authors studied several prominences and found that the extrapolated field strength is rather low for typically quiescent prominence ( less that 10 g ) , higher than 10 g for a plage filament and can reach 30 - 40 g for active - region prominences .",
    "this clearly shows how important the knowledge of the prominence type is : when we speak about the fine structure of quiescent prominences ( as in this review ) , we can not use measurements obtained for other types of structures .",
    "some of the recent measurements which indicate rather strong fields seem to be related to more active structures .",
    "moreover , these new measurements were not obtained using the coronagraphs and thus , because of scattered light higher above the limb , the measurements are more restricted to lower heights where the prominences appear brighter and where the polarization signal / noise ratio is sufficient ( lpez ariste  private communication ) .",
    "the usefulness of the filament modeling with linear fff was rather convincingly demonstrated by @xcite who performed a kind of `` blind test '' : magnetic dips obtained from numerical extrapolation were marked by black bars schematically indicating the location of the absorbing h@xmath1 material ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ ph - fig6 ] .",
    "the shape of the filament and its various parts were then compared with the true shape as observed on the disk in h@xmath1 and the agreement is quite reasonable .",
    "non - linear fff models were considered e.g. , by @xcite .     computed dark - fibril pattern from linear fff extrapolations ( left ) and the corresponding filament observed in the h@xmath1 line ( right ) .",
    "see the text where this `` blind '' test is described . from @xcite . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   computed dark - fibril pattern from linear fff extrapolations ( left ) and the corresponding filament observed in the h@xmath1 line ( right ) .",
    "see the text where this `` blind '' test is described . from @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]    for a given curvature of the magnetic dip , @xcite assumed that the dip is filled by cool plasma up to one pressure scale - height @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean molecular mass ( fig .",

    "dips one can draw the bars which indicate the presence of the absorbing material and have the length 2@xmath18 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ ph - fig7 ] .",
    "however , the real distribution of the opacity will depend on the actual dip configuration , mass loading in it and on various plasma parameters including the hydrogen excitation / ionization conditions .",

    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]      spectroscopic determinations of the plasma density and its ionization degree , together with spectro - polarimetric determinations of the magnetic field lead in many cases to rather high values of the plasma-@xmath0 .",
    "this is for example the case of a sample of 14 prominences studied by @xcite , where the plasma-@xmath0 reaches unity in several cases ( see also the non - lte analysis of these prominences by @xcite ) . using a simple 1d mhs configuration for a vertical fine - structure slab ( representing vertical threads as seen in fig .",
    "[ ph - fig2 ] ) , one can easily derive a relation between the plasma-@xmath0 and the angle @xmath19 of the magnetic - field inclination at the border of the dip ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath20 .",
    "construction of equilibrium configurations in which the weight of the plasma inside the magnetic dip is balanced against the solar gravity by the lorentz force is a difficult task .",
    "an analytical solution to this problem , assuming that the whole prominence is represented by a 1d vertical plasma slab hanging in a dipped magnetic field , was proposed already in 1957 by kippenhahn and schlter ( so - called `` normal '' polarity model ) , while @xcite have suggested a similar model but with an `` inverse '' polarity .",
    "based on the idea of @xcite that the fine - structure threads are in fact vertically - aligned magnetic dips loaded with mass , @xcite and @xcite started to model such gravity - induced dips using general 1d or 2d mhs equilibria , respectively .",
    "such local solutions within the magnetic dip are sometimes called ks - type models ( according to kippenhahn and schlter ) because they use the ks - type analytical solution of the pressure equilibrium ( see section 8) . however , they have nothing to do with the global magnetic topology of the whole prominence so that the inverse - polarity prominences can be treated in the same way .",
    "a comprehensive description of the gravity - induced dip models is given in the lecture notes by @xcite to which the reader is referred for further details .",
    "here we will only mention one important result , namely the dependence of the plasma-@xmath0 on the mass loading @xmath21 and the field strength @xmath12 , which can be derived for 1d vertical slab in mhs equilibrium ( @xcite )    @xmath22    using the results of @xcite , one can relate this @xmath21 to optical parameters like the h@xmath1 line - center optical thickness or h@xmath1 integrated intensity .",
    "recently , @xcite have also considered a series of 1d gravity - induced dips aligned along the prominence spine and being in mhs equilibrium of the ks - type ( fig .",
    "[ ph - fig8 ] ) .",
    "however , these authors did not consider the radiative transfer in these structures and thus could not predict their optical properties like the h@xmath1 contrast against the disk .",
    "they only draw the black bars as other authors do in case of low-@xmath0 dips .",
    "finally , we should also mention that some authors considered waves propagating vertically within a flux - tube and aimed at supporting the cool plasma against the gravity .",
    "for example , @xcite have suggested mhd waves .",
    "they show an illustratory example ( see their fig .  1 ) of such `` vertical flux - tubes '' in a quiescent prominence with presumably vertical field in which the waves are propagating .",
    "however , this example rather resembles the situation discussed by @xcite , i.e. , quasi - vertical fine - structure threads which are threaded by horizontal field lines .",
    "there is also an ongoing debate whether the field in barbs is more inclined or quasi - vertical ( @xcite ) or made of dips ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the former case , for flows which do not correspond to a free fall",

    "the energetics of quiescent prominences is still an unsolved problem .",
    "although mutually connected , we can divide this problem in two aspects : the energetics of central cool cores of the fse and the energetics of their pctrs .",
    "the basic question is whether the incident radiation which almost fully determines the radiation properties of cool cores can also determine the kinetic temperature in these regions . in other words , is the cool core of fse in a radiative equilibrium or do we need some extra heating to achieve the observed values of temperatures which are typically between 6000 to 9000 k. the computation of the radiative equilibrium under the non - lte conditions is a rather difficult task , moreover , the result will strongly depend on the incident radiation fields used as boundary conditions for the solution of the radiation transfer problem .",
    "radiation - equilibrium models in 1d slabs , for a mixture of hydrogen and helium plasma , were first constructed by @xcite who arrived at relatively low temperatures , down to 4600 k. by adding some extra energy input via a heating function , higher temperatures were obtained in accordance with typical observations . since the thermal conductivity is not efficient in these central cool parts , several other mechanisms were considered during the last few decades . among them , we can mention mainly the wave dissipation or enthalpy transport .",
    "however , a surprisingly new result was recently obtained by @xcite , who computed a set of fine - structure models in radiation equilibrium .",
    "1d axially - symmetric cylinders represent vertically standing threads illuminated by the disk radiation . with currently used incident radiation fields ( @xcite ) , @xcite arrived at much higher radiation - equilibrium temperatures as compared to the results of @xcite  we show this in fig .",
    "[ ph - fig9 ] .",
    "namely thinner cylinders which are of interest for the fine - structure modeling ( plots in fig .",
    "[ ph - fig9]a ) reveal temperatures between 7000 and 9500 k for gas pressures between 0.5 to 0.01 dyn cm@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "this would then mean that no extra heating is required for cool central parts of fine - strucure threads .",
    "in these models only the radiative losses due to the hydrogen were considered , which nevertheless can be compared with results of @xcite because the helium does not contribute much . however , there is still an open question concerning the importance of other species like calcium , magnesium or other optically - thin losses ( see e.g. , discussion by @xcite ) .",

    "say up to 10@xmath5  k , the conduction along the magnetic field already plays a role ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in analogy to cctr ( @xcite ) , the ambipolar diffusion was also considered for fine - structure prominence threads by @xcite .",
    "quite recently , @xcite tested various kinds of 1d models against the soho / sumer observations of hydrogen lyman line intensities and found that all models with the ambipolar diffusion predict unrealistically high integrated intensities of the lyman @xmath0 line .",
    "this can be related to the relative orientation of the line of sight and the magnetic field as discussed in @xcite . at still higher temperatures ,",
    "most of the work was restricted to the analysis of the differential emission measure ( dem ) ",
    "see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , this analysis is usually based on the so - called coronal approximation and thus the question arises whether the departures from this approximation , due to radiative excitations , can play any important role . for chromospheric conditions ,",
    "this issue is discussed in this book by @xcite . at temperatures higher than 30000 k",
    ", dynamical models of flux - tubes with prominence condensations were studied using extensive numerical simulations of the time - dependent loop energetics and plasma dynamics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the equations of magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium originally derived by ks become considerably simpler if one uses instead of the cartesian coordinate @xmath24 the column - mass coordinate @xmath25 , defined by the relation @xmath26 where @xmath8 is the the plasma density .",
    "@xmath25 = 0 at one surface of the prominence slab and @xmath27 at the opposite .",
    "loading of such mass into an initially horizontal magnetic field leads to a formation of a gravity - induced dip as we will demonstrate in the next section .",
    "the pressure - balance equation for such a 1d equilibrium dip configuration is governed by the equation @xmath28 where @xmath7 is the gas and turbulent pressure and @xmath29 is the coronal pressure at the surfaces .",
    "this equation was first derived by @xcite and used to model prominences as a whole . at the slab surface one",
    "has the vertical component of the field vector @xmath30 which gives , together with the horizontal component @xmath31const .",
    "@xmath32 using this formula , we obtain for @xmath33 @xmath34 the quantity @xmath33 can be interpreted in the following way : at the slab center we have the pressure @xmath35 if @xmath29 would be zero , then @xmath36 , which is the magnetic pressure .",
    "therefore , in this case the gas pressure at the slab centre will be equal to the magnetic pressure calculated with @xmath37 .",
    "this formulation with the column mass has a great advantage of a simple analytical integration which is valid for any ( i.e. , non - constant ) temperature and ionization - degree distribution . to get the density @xmath38 we use the state equation with the mean molecular mass @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ionization degree of hydrogen @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the proton and hydrogen densities , respectively ) , @xmath1 the helium abundance relative to hydrogen and @xmath44 the hydrogen atom mass .",
    "@xmath40 varies between zero ( neutral gas ) and unity ( fully - ionized plasma ) . inside the prominence and its pctr",
    ", one can consider some schematic variation of @xmath40 with depth but for a given prominence model the true ionization - degree structure results from rather complex non - lte radiative - transfer calculations .",
    "the 1d - slab mhs equilibrium of this type was first used by @xcite , who combined it with the full set of non - lte equations .",
    "their models were aimed at describing the whole prominence .",
    "a similar study was repeated recently by @xcite who have considered a grid of models and studied their energetics . in the latter work , new incident radiation fields and the partial - redistribution in hydrogen lyman lines were used . as a next step ,",
    "@xcite have generalized these 1d models to two dimensions and developed fully 2d mhs models coupled to the radiation field .",
    "the latter were computed using the 2d radiative - transfer technique similar to that of @xcite . in this way",
    ", all quantities including the ionization structure were consistently evaluated in the frame of such a 2d radiation - mhs ( rmhs ) approach .",
    "however , contrary to previous work , these 2d models were aimed at representing the vertical fine - structure threads frequently observed in quiescent prominences .",
    "the only drawback of this kind of modeling is that @xcite did nt consider the energy - balance problem and , instead , used some kind of empirical temperature structure .",
    "their pctr _ along _ the magnetic field lines is much more extended as compared to that _ across _ the lines , which corresponds to different thermal conductivities . since these 2d models allow us to look at the fine - structure threads in various directions , we see that the respective synthetic spectra reflect very well the different structure of pctr s .",
    "namely the hydrogen lyman lines appear quite reversed when we look across the field lines and much less reversed or even unreversed when looking along the field lines .",
    "this quite interesting behaviour was discovered already in @xcite on basis of soho / sumer spectra .    in subsequent papers , @xcite and @xcite",
    "extended this 2d modeling of vertical threads to a 12-level plus continuum hydrogen model atom and studied in detail the formation of hydrogen lyman lines and lyman continuum . in fig .",
    "[ ph - fig10 ] we show one of their results , and namely the 2d contribution functions which illustrate the formation of hydrogen lyman lines along and across the field lines , in a 2d vertical thread with pctr temperatures ranging up to 50 000 k in this numerical box .",
    "this pattern is quite complex but leads to synthetic line profiles which are in good agreement with soho / sumer observations ( see also the paper by gunr et al .  on p.  317ff in this volume ) .",
    "the sensitivity of lyman - line profiles to orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the line of sight has been also proven recently by @xcite who studied a kind of `` round - shape filament '' approaching the solar limb and consecutively showing its different parts above the limb having different orientations of the field lines .",
    "finally , let us note that these 2d threads which can be anisotropically irradiated represent the basic ingredient of a more realistic multi - thread modeling .",
    "several such threads distributed in space will be illuminated by the solar radiation penetrating through this `` forest '' of threads and the mutual radiative interaction between all those threads can be consistently taken into account .",
    "another important aspect of this 2d mhs modeling is that such threads or their clusters can represents prototypes of realistic models used to synthesize the stokes profiles and thus study the influence of the fine structure on the polarization signals .",

    "equation ( 3 ) gives the 1d mhs equilibrium of the ks - type . in order to see how the cool and dense plasma structure can evolve in the magnetic field under the action of lorentz and gravity forces",
    ", @xcite solved numerically the system of compressible one - fluid mhd equations in a 2d vertical plane , starting with the dense and cool blob ( a thread in 3d ) representing a thread of the filament fine structure surrounded by the gravitationally stratified , constant - temperature hot corona .",

    "the plasma blob starts to fall down , the internal electric current is induced inside it which generates the restoring lorenz force . due to the inertial mass",
    "the blob overshoots the ( global ) equilibrium point and an upward - directed lorentz force prevails over the gravity turning the movement of the blob up .",
    "the system starts to oscillate but due to the numerical viscous term the oscillations are damped .",

    "any analysis of 2d images or movies can lead to misinterpretations just due to the lack of information on fully 3d structural and dynamical pattern . as an example we will mention here again the scenario of counter - streaming ( @xcite or @xcite ) . a close inspection of high - resolution h@xmath1 movies ( see them on cd enclosed to the solar physics vol .",
    "216 ) reveals that dark fine - strucure blobs ( rather than long threads ) move on relatively short paths , although sometimes in opposite directions .",
    "these motions do nt resemble at all flows along long magnetic fluxtubes , but rather a kind of oscillations .",
    "quite interestingly , when watching the trace movies of similar prominences , one clearly sees sideway oscillations of small blobs which , projected on the disk , would probably resemble the kind of motions seen on sst movies ( projected blobs seen in h@xmath1 and trace 195 are shown in fig .",
    "[ ph - fig5 ] ) . however , these blobs visible on trace movies form very frequently the quasi - vertical threads also shown in fig .  [ ph - fig1 ] and fig",
    ".  [ ph - fig2 ] and thus , according to our discussion above , they should represent plasma condensations hanging in a dipped magnetic field which seems to oscillate in the corona .",
    "this scenario is , however , quite different from that of @xcite ( flows along long fluxtubes without any dips ) .",
    "another observational support for dips being located along the prominence spine is the fact that the h@xmath1 absorbing fibrils are concentrated along the spine and we typically do nt see any significant absorption further away from the spine .",
    "this seems to indicate that there are no such flows which could be detected along the whole magnetic arcade which is of course much wider than the width of the spine .",
    "even h@xmath1 images or movies taken out of the line center do nt show such a pattern .",
    "actually there should be no principal controversy between low-@xmath0 dip models and gravity - induced dip models .",
    "yet there are no time - dependent simulations of how the plasma is condensed in a dipped field and how this may evolve leading to an enhancement of the plasma density and thus its weight which , eventually , will modify the magnetic structure of the dip .",
    "existing time - dependent simulations of prominence condensations assume an initial shape of the magnetic loop and this is not changed during simulations even when the mass loading at the loop top increases .",
    "static models of dips which neglect the prominence weight ( fff extrapolations ) can reasonably well reproduce the large - scale distribution of dips and this has proven to be a quite novel approach . on the other hand , static models of gravity - induced dips have been developed to understand the _ local _ magnetic topology of a dip and its thermodynamic and radiative properties .",
    "these two approaches should not be in conflict , but rather complementary : provided that the plasma-@xmath0 is large enough , the weight effects should be added to initially fff - dips .",
    "this is a challenge for future prominence modeling . as discussed above , today the actual values of plasma beta are still very uncertain and thus various configurations are possible",
    ". an important diagnostics test would be the quantitative modeling of the h@xmath1 contrast of fine - structure fibrils located along the filament spines .",
    "this contrast , which certainly increases with increasing spatial resolution of new telescopes , is due to the absorption of the background radiation in the h@xmath1 line ( the scattering contribution to the source function is typically small ) .",
    "it has to be modeled in 3d fibril geometry which requires realistic estimate of the mass loading .",
    "an example of how this can be handled was given recently by @xcite , who used some kind of ( 2 + 1)d models to demonstrate the theoretical h@xmath1 contrast of gravity - induced magnetic dips as projected against the solar disk .",
    "a few examples are shown in fig .",
