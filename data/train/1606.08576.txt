    "the phenomenon of quantum hall effect is not limited to perfectly two dimensional systems and is reported to occur in a number of bulk systems with high anisotropy and layered structures , such as gaas / algaas multi - quantum wells  @xcite , graphite  @xcite , bechgaard salts  @xcite , mo@xmath37o@xmath38  @xcite , bi@xmath39sn@xmath40te@xmath1  @xcite , and sb@xmath39sn@xmath40te@xmath1  @xcite .",

    "the observation of qhe in the bulk transport regime of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 demonstrates that a transition from 3d to perfect 2d transport is not an essential requirement for qhe in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",

    "@xcite suggested that possibly the enhanced warping and nesting of bulk conduction band at high @xmath2 drives the formation of charge density waves which are important for observation of bulk quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "the hexagonal wrapping of fermi surface of surface states at high carrier concentration has been observed in arpes studies  @xcite but no such deformation of bulk states has been reported till now . moreover , the temperature dependence of resistivity ( see fig .",

    "the bulk quantum hall effect can also occur in narrow band semiconductors having disorder broadened defects / impurity band near the fermi energy and 3d landau levels in bulk band . at high fields , the resonance between the impurity band and the bulk band forms the localized state at the edge of each landau level and these localized states cause the quantum hall effect in these systems  @xcite .",
    "such 3d quantum hall effect has been observed in bi@xmath39sn@xmath40te@xmath1  @xcite , sb@xmath39sn@xmath40te@xmath1  @xcite , hg@xmath48cd@xmath40te  @xcite , and insb  @xcite .",

    "the observation of quantum hall effect in samples having @xmath50  @xmath4 but its absence in samples with @xmath51@xmath4  @xcite suggest that if qhe is only governed by carrier concentration ( @xmath2 ) , the critical concentration for qhe lies between @xmath52 to @xmath53@xmath4 .",
    "the other important characteristic of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 samples exhibiting qhe is their relatively large dingle temperature ( t@xmath28 ) ; t@xmath28 for our sample is @xmath8 40  k  @xcite , for cao et al .",

    "recent hard x - ray photoemission experiments show the presence of vacancies / defects states close to the fermi energy of bi@xmath0se@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the resonance between the disorder broadened vacancies / defects band and the 3d landau levels could cause the quantum hall effect in our system .",
    "the appearance of quantum hall effect in highly doped and disordered samples ( present study , ref .",
    "@xcite&@xcite ) and its absence in less doped and clean samples ( ref .",
    "@xcite&@xcite ) supports this conjuncture .",
    "further systematic investigations on samples with different disorder by varying @xmath2 either by substitution or by creating vacancies would help in determining whether the charge carrier density @xmath2 or the crystalline defects / disorder dictates the appearance of qhe and the physical mechanism responsible for it .",
    "in conclusion , we present the observation of quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in a bi@xmath0se@xmath1 crystal , and discusses its possible origin .",
    "our results show that qhe in our system is not from 2d surface states but from the bulk of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 having 3d fermi surface .",
    "these results are important , as they reveal that the perfect 2d transport is not an essential criterion for qhe in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "the bulk qhe in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is ascribed to formation of localized state at the edge of landau levels due to presence of disorder broadened defect band near fermi energy .",
    "a comparison of our results with literature suggest that a transition from qhe to non - qhe behavior is expected between n@xmath81@xmath2510@xmath26 @xmath4 to 5@xmath2510@xmath55 @xmath4 .",
    "the correlation of qhe with the carrier concentration and microstrain indicate that bi@xmath0se@xmath1 can be tuned in its various transport regimes e.g qhe to non - qhe , 2d to 3d and dirac to non - dirac conduction on variation of carrier concentration and strain / micro - strain .",
