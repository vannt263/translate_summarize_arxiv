    "today s global economy is more interconnected and complex than ever , and seems out of any particular institution s control .",
    "the diversity of markets and traded products , the complexity of their structure and regulation , make it a daunting challenge to understand behaviours , predict trends or prevent systemic crises . the neo - classical approach , that aimed at explaining global behaviour in terms of perfectly rational actors , has largely failed @xcite .",
    "yet , persistent statistical regularities in empirical data suggest that a less ambitious goal of explaining economic phenomena as emergent statistical properties of a large interacting system may be possible , without requiring much from agents rationality ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most robust empirical stylised fact , since the work of pareto , is the observation of a broad distribution of wealth which approximately follows a power law .",
    "such a power law distribution of wealth does not require sophisticated assumptions on the rationality of players , but it can be reproduced by a plethora of simple models ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in which it emerges as a typical behaviour  i.e. as the behaviour that the system exhibits with very high probability  within quite generic settings .",
    "the debate on inequality has a long history , dating back at least to the work of kutznets @xcite on the u - shaped relationship of inequality on development .",
    "much research has focused on the relation between inequality and growth ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "inequality has also been suggested to be positively correlated with a number of indicators of social disfunction , from infant mortality and health to social mobility and crime @xcite .",
    "the subject has regained much interest recently , in view of the claim that levels of inequality have reached the same levels as in the beginning of the 20th century @xcite .",
    "saez and zucman @xcite corroborate these findings , studying the evolution of the distribution of wealth in the us economy over the last century , and they find an increasing concentration of wealth in the hands of the 0.01% of the richest .",
    "figure [ fig : data ] shows that the data in saez and zucman @xcite is consistent with a power law distribution @xmath0 , with a good agreement down to the 10% of the richest ( see caption ref .",
    "@xcite reports the fraction @xmath1 of wealth in the hands of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 richest individuals . if the fraction of individuals with wealth larger than @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath5 , the wealth share @xmath1 in the hands of the richest @xmath6 percent of the population satisfies @xmath7 ( for @xmath8 ) .",
    "hence @xmath9 is estimated from the slope of the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] ( left ) for a few representative years .",
    "the error on @xmath9 is computed as three standard deviations in the least square fit . ] ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 has been steadily decreasing in the last 30 years , reaching the same levels it attained at the beginning of the 20th century ( @xmath12 in 1917 ) .",
    "of the wealth distribution ( left y - axis ) as a function of time .",
    "both time series refer to the us .",

    "liquidity , defined as the probability that a unit - money random exchange takes place , ( right y - axis ) as a function of @xmath9 , in the synthetic economy described by our model ( see eq .",
    "[ def : pavg ] and figure [ fig : k10_ps_beta ] for details on the numerical simulations).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    rather than focusing on the determinants of inequality , here we focus on a specific consequence of inequality , i.e. on its impact on liquidity .",
    "there are a number of reasons why this is relevant .",
    "first of all , the efficiency of a market economy essentially resides on its ability to allow agents to exchange goods .",
    "a direct measure of the efficiency is the number of possible exchanges that can be realised or equivalently the probability that a random exchange can take place .",
    "this probability quantifies the `` fluidity '' of exchanges and we shall call it _ liquidity _ in what follows .",
    "this is the primary measure of efficiency that we shall focus on .",
    "secondly , liquidity , as intended here , has been the primary concern of monetary polices such as quantitative easing aimed at contrasting deflation and the slowing down of the economy , in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis . a quantitative measure of liquidity is provided by the _ velocity of money _",
    "@xcite , measured as the ratio between the nominal gross domestic product and the money stock and it quantifies how often a unit of currency changes hand within the economy .",
    "as figure [ fig : data ] shows , the velocity of money has been steadily declining in the last decades .",
    "this paper suggests that this decline and the increasing level of inequality are not a coincidence .",
    "rather the former is a consequence of the latter .    without clear yardsticks marking levels of inequality that seriously hamper the functioning of an economy , the debate on inequality runs the risk of remaining at a qualitative or ideological level .",
    "our main finding is that , in the simplified setting of our model , there is a sharp threshold beyond which inequality becomes intolerable .",
    "more precisely , when the power law exponent of the wealth distribution approaches one from above , liquidity vanishes and the economy halts because all available ( liquid ) financial resources concentrate in the hands of few agents .",
    "this provides a precise , quantitative measure of when inequality becomes too much .",
    "our main goal in the present work is thus to isolate the relation between inequality and liquidity in the simplest possible model that allows us to draw sharp and robust conclusions .",
    "specifically , the model is based on a simplified trading dynamics in which agents with a pareto distributed wealth randomly trade goods of different prices .",
    "agents receive offers to buy goods and each such transaction is executed if it is compatible with the budget constraint of the buying agent .",
    "this reflects a situation where , at those prices , agents are indifferent between all feasible allocations .",
    "the model is in the spirit of random exchange models ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but our emphasis is not on whether the equilibrium can be reached or not .",
    "in fact we show that the dynamics converges to a steady state , which corresponds to a maximally entropic state where all feasible allocations occur with the same probability .",
    "rather we focus on the allocation of cash in the resulting stationary state and on the liquidity of the economy , defined as the fraction of attempted exchanges that are successful .",
    "we remark that since the wealth distribution is fixed , the causal link between inequality and liquidity is clear in the simplified setting we consider .    within our model ,",
    "the freezing of the economy occurs because when inequality in the wealth distribution increases , financial resources ( i.e. cash ) concentrate more and more in the hands of few agents ( the wealthiest ) , leaving the vast majority without the financial means to trade .",
    "this ultimately suppresses the probability of successful exchanges , i.e. liquidity ( see figure [ fig : data ] , right ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : we start by describing the model and its basic characteristics in section [ sec : modeldescription ] , providing a quick overview of the main results and features of the model in section [ sec : main_features ] . in section",
    "[ sec : solutionsnumerical_and_analytical ] we explain in more detail how these features can be understood by an approximated solution of the master equation governing the trading dynamics .",
    "details on the analytical derivations and monte carlo simulations are thoroughly presented in the appendices .",
    "we conclude with some remarks in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "the model consists of @xmath13 agents , each with wealth @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "agents are allowed to trade among themselves @xmath16 objects .",
    "each object @xmath17 has a price @xmath18 .",
    "a given allocation of goods among the agents is described by an @xmath19 allocation matrix @xmath20 with entries @xmath21 if agent @xmath22 owns good @xmath23 and zero otherwise .",
    "agents can only own baskets of goods that they can afford , i.e. whose total value does not exceed their wealth .",
    "the wealth not invested in goods @xmath24 corresponds to the cash ( liquid capital ) that agent @xmath22 has available for trading .",
    "the inequality @xmath25 for all @xmath22 indicate that lending is not allowed .",
    "therefore the set of feasible allocations ",
    "those for which @xmath25 for all @xmath22  is only a small fraction of the @xmath26 conceivable allocation matrices @xmath20 .",
    "starting from a feasible allocation matrix @xmath20 , we introduce a random trading dynamics in which a good @xmath23 is picked uniformly at random among all goods .",
    "its owner then attempts to sell it to another agent @xmath22 drawn uniformly at random among the other agents . if agent @xmath22 has enough cash to buy the product @xmath23 , that is if @xmath27 , the transaction is successful and his / her cash decreases by @xmath18 while the cash of the seller increases by @xmath18 .",
    "we do not allow objects to be divided .",
    "notice that the total capital @xmath14 of agents does not change over time , so @xmath14 and the prices @xmath18 are parameters of the model .",
    "the entries of the allocation matrix , and consequently the cash , are dynamical variables , which evolve over time according to this dynamics .",
    "this model belongs to the class of zero - intelligent agent - based models , in the sense that agents do not try to maximize any utility function .",
    "an interesting property of our dynamics is that the stochastic transition matrix @xmath28 is symmetric between any two feasible configurations @xmath20 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",
    "we note that any feasible allocation @xmath20 can be reached from any other feasible allocation @xmath29 by a sequence of trades .",
    "this implies that the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition , with a stationary distribution over the space of feasible configurations that is uniform : @xmath31 .",
    "alternative choices of dynamics which also fulfil these conditions are explored in appendix [ app : rules_enumeration ] .",
    "in particular , we focus on realisations where the wealth @xmath14 is drawn from a pareto distribution @xmath32 , for @xmath33 for each agent @xmath22 .",
    "we let @xmath9 vary to explore different levels of inequality , and compare different economies in which the ratio between the total wealth @xmath34 and the total value of all objects @xmath35 is kept fixed .",
    "we use @xmath36 so as to have feasible allocations .",
    "we consider cases where the @xmath16 objects are divided into a small number @xmath37 of classes with @xmath38 objects per class ( @xmath39 ) ; objects belonging to class @xmath40 have the same price @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath42 is the number of object of class @xmath40 that agent @xmath22 owns , then takes the form @xmath43 .",
    "the main result of this model is that the flow of goods among agents becomes more and more congested as inequality increases until it halts completely when the pareto exponent @xmath9 tends to one from above .",
    "the origin of this behaviour can be understood in the simplest setting where @xmath44 , i.e. all goods have the same price @xmath45 ( we are going to omit the subscript @xmath46 in this case ) .",
    "figure [ fig : picturesque_richpoor_transition_beta ] shows the capital composition @xmath47 for all agents in the stationary state , where @xmath48 is the average number of goods owned by agent @xmath22 .",
    "the population of agents separates into two distinct classes : a _ class of cash - poor _ agents , who own an average number of goods that is very close to the maximum allowed by their wealth , and a _ cash - rich class _ , where agents have on average the same number of goods .",
    "these two classes are separated by a sharp crossover region .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig : picturesque_richpoor_transition_beta ] shows the cash distribution @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 represents the number of goods they are able to buy ) for some representative agents .",
    "while cash - poor agents have a cash distribution peaked at @xmath51 , the wealthiest agents have cash in abundance .",
    "agents , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "points @xmath47 denote the average composition of capital for different agents obtained in monte carlo simulations .",
    "this is compared with the analytical solution obtained from the master equation ( green dashed line ) given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : me_solution_1good ] ) .",
    "the vertical dashed line at @xmath55 indicates the analytically predicted value of the crossover wealth that separates the two classes of agents .",
    "insets : cash distributions @xmath56 of the indicated agents . ]",
    "these two observations allow us to trace the origin of the arrest in the economy back to the shrinkage of the _ cash - rich class _ to a vanishingly small fraction of the population , as @xmath57 . as we ll see in the next section , when @xmath9 is smaller than @xmath58 the fraction of agents belonging to this class vanishes as @xmath59 . in this regime ,",
    "not only the wealthiest few individuals own a finite fraction of the whole economy s wealth , as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but they also drain all the financial resources in the economy .",
    "these findings extend to more complex settings .",
    "figure [ fig : k10_ps_beta ] illustrates this for an economy with @xmath60 classes of goods ( see figure caption for details ) and different values of @xmath9 . in order to visualise the freezing of the flow of goods we introduce the success rate of transactions for goods belonging to class @xmath40 , denoted as @xmath61 .",
    "figure [ fig : k10_ps_beta ] shows that , as expected , for a fixed value of the pareto exponent @xmath9 the success rate increases as the goods become cheaper , as they are easier to trade .",
    "secondly it shows that trades of all classes of goods halt as @xmath9 tends to unity , that is when wealth inequality becomes too large , independently of their price .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the decrease of @xmath61 when inequality increases ( i.e. as @xmath9 decreases ) is a consequence of the concentration of cash in the hands of the wealthiest agents .",
    "this can be observed in the right panel of figure [ fig : k10_ps_beta ] , which shows the average cash of agents with a given wealth , for different values of @xmath9 .",
    "the freezing of the economy when @xmath9 decreases occurs because fewer and fewer agents can dispose of enough cash ( i.e. have @xmath62 ) to buy the different goods ( prices @xmath41 correspond to the dashed lines ) .",
    "note finally that @xmath61 quantifies liquidity in terms of goods . in order to have an equivalent measure in terms of cash that can be compared to the velocity of money , we average @xmath63 over all goods @xmath64 this quantifies the frequency with which a unit of cash changes hand in our model economy , as a result of a successful transaction .",
    "it s behaviour as a function of @xmath9 for the same parameters of the economy in figure [ fig : k10_ps_beta ] is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : data ] .",
    "in order to shed light on the findings described above , in this section we describe how to derive them within an analytic approach .",
    "we start by dealing with the simpler case where all the goods in the system have the same price @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( i.e. @xmath44 ) .    a formal approach to this problem consists in writing the complete master equation that describes the evolution of the probability @xmath67 to find the economy in a state where each agent @xmath68 has a definite number @xmath69 of goods .",
    "taking the sum over all values of @xmath70 for @xmath71 , one can derive the master equation for a single agent with wealth @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding marginal distribution @xmath72 in the stationary state can be derived from the detailed balance condition @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the maximum number of goods which agent @xmath22 can buy with wealth @xmath14 and @xmath75 is the probability that a transaction where agent @xmath22 sells one good ( i.e. @xmath76 ) is successful .",
    "( [ eq : mastereq3_1good_1guy ] ) says that , in the stationary state , the probability that agent @xmath22 has @xmath77 objects and buys a new object is equal to the probability to find agent @xmath22 with @xmath78 objects , selling successfully one of them .",
    "the factor @xmath79 enforces the condition that agent @xmath22 can afford at most @xmath80 goods and it implies that @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "exchanges are successful if the buyer @xmath83 does not already have a saturated budget @xmath84 . so the probability @xmath75 is also given by @xmath85 where the last relation holds because when @xmath86 the dependence on @xmath77 becomes negligible .",
    "this is important , because it implies that for @xmath13 large the variables @xmath69 can be considered as independent , i.e. @xmath87 , and the problem can be reduced to that of computing the marginals @xmath88 self - consistently .    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mastereq3_1good_1guy ] ) can be written as a truncated poissonian with parameter @xmath89 @xmath90 \\theta\\left(m_i - z \\right ) \\label{eq : me_solution_1good}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath91 is a normalization factor that can be fixed by @xmath92 .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath75  or equivalently of @xmath93  can be found self - consistently , by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : ps_1guy ] ) .",
    "notice that the most likely value of @xmath77 for an agent with @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 this provides a natural distinction between cash - poor agents  those with @xmath96  that often can not afford to buy further objects , and cash - rich ones  those with @xmath97  who typically have enough cash to buy further objects .",
    "this separation into two classes of agents was already pointed out in figure [ fig : picturesque_richpoor_transition_beta ] . in terms of wealth ,",
    "the poor are defined as those with @xmath98 whereas the rich ones have @xmath99 , where the threshold wealth is given by @xmath100 .",
    "notice that when @xmath101 , a condition that occurs when the economy is nearly frozen ( @xmath102 ) , the distribution @xmath72 is sharply peaked around @xmath103 so that its average is @xmath104 .",
    "then the separation between the two classes becomes rather sharp , as in figure [ fig : picturesque_richpoor_transition_beta ] .    in this regime",
    ", we can also derive an estimate of @xmath75 in the limit @xmath105 , for @xmath8 .",

    "( [ eq : c1_correct ] ) , we have @xmath120 .",
    "therefore the liquidity @xmath75 vanishes as @xmath116 .",

    "an estimate of @xmath75 for finite @xmath13 and @xmath122 can be obtained by observing that the wealth @xmath117 marking the separation between the two classes can not be larger than the wealth @xmath123 of the wealthiest agent . by extreme value theory ,",
    "the latter is given by @xmath124 , with @xmath125 .",
    "therefore the solution is characterised by @xmath126 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath122 the average wealth is dominated by the wealthiest few , i.e. @xmath127 and therefore @xmath128 .",
    "in other words , in this limit the cash - rich class is composed of a finite number of agents , who hold almost all the cash of the economy .",
    "figure [ fig : summary_section_one_object ] ( left ) shows that the rough analytical estimate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ps_correct ] ) is in good agreement with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the analysis carries forward to the general case in which @xmath37 classes of goods are considered , starting from the full master equation for the joint probability of the ownership vectors @xmath129 for all agents @xmath68 . for the same reasons as before",
    ", the problem can be reduced to that of computing the marginal distribution @xmath130 of a single agent .",
    "the main complication is that the maximum number @xmath131 of goods of class @xmath40 that agent @xmath22 can get now depends on how many of the other goods agent @xmath22 owns , i.e. @xmath132 , where @xmath133 .",
    "the detailed balance condition @xmath134 again yields the stationary state distribution ( for @xmath86 ) . on the left we have the probability that one of the @xmath135 objects of type @xmath40 of agent @xmath22 is picked for a successful sale ( here @xmath136 is the vector with all zero components and with a @xmath137 component equal to one , and",
    "@xmath61 is the probability that a sale of an object of type @xmath40 is successful ) .",

    ", this implies that all markets freeze : @xmath161 .",
    "the arrest of the flow of goods appears to be extremely robust against all choices of the parameter @xmath41 , as @xmath162 is an upper bound for the other success rates of transactions @xmath61 .",
    "these conclusions are fully consistent with the results of extensive numerical simulations ( see figure [ fig : summary_section_one_object ] in appendix [ app : derivationofps ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a zero - intelligence trading dynamics in which agents have a pareto distributed wealth and randomly trade goods with different prices .",
    "we have shown that this dynamics leads to a uniform distribution in the space of the allocations that are compatible with the budget constraints .",
    "we have also shown that when the inequality in the distribution of wealth increases , the economy converges to an equilibrium where typically ( i.e. with probability very close to one ) the less wealthy agents have less and less cash available , as their budget becomes saturated by objects of the cheapest type . at the same time",
    "this class of cash - starved agents takes up a larger and larger fraction of the economy , thereby leading to a complete halt of the economy when the distribution of wealth becomes so broad that its expected average diverges ( i.e. when @xmath57 ) . in these cases , a finite number of the wealthiest agents own almost all the cash of the economy .",
    "the model presented in this paper is intentionally simple , so as to highlight a simple , robust and quantifiable link between inequality and liquidity .",
    "in particular , the model neglects important aspects such as _ i ) _ agents incentives and preferential trading , _ ii ) _ endogenous price dynamics and _ iii ) _ credit .",
    "it is worth discussing each of these issues in order to address whether the inclusion of some of these factors would revert our finding that inequality and liquidity are negatively related .",
    "first , our model assumes that all exchanges that are compatible with budget constraints will take place , but in more realistic setting only exchanges that increase each party s utility should take place . yet",
    "if the economy freezes in the case where agents would accept all exchanges that are compatible with their budget , it should also freeze when only a subset of these exchanges are feasible .",
    "also the model assumes that all agents trade with the same frequency whereas one might expect that rich agents trade more frequently than poorer ones .",
    "could liquidity be restored if trading patterns exhibit some level of homophily , with rich people trading more often and preferentially with rich people ?",
    "first we note that both these effects are already present in our simple setting .",
    "agents with higher wealth are selected more frequently as sellers as they own a larger share of the objects . in spite of",
    "the fact that buyers are chosen at random , successful trades occur more frequently when the buyer is wealthy .",
    "so , in the trades actually observed the wealthier do trade more frequently than the less wealthy , and preferentially with other wealthy agents .",
    "furthermore , if agents are allowed to trade only with agents having a similar wealth ( e.g. with the @xmath163 agents immediately wealthier or less wealthy ) it is easy to show that detailed balance still holds with the same uniform distribution on allocations . as long as all the states are accessible , the stationary probability distribution remains the same changes , in particular for goods more expensive than @xmath164 , the seller is typically cash - rich and thus its neighbours are too .",
    "this can induce to have a liquidity of expensive goods higher than that of cheaper ones .",
    "however in the limit @xmath57 , it is still true that cash concentrates in the hands of a vanishing fraction of agents , and there is still a freeze of the economy . ] .",
    "therefore , our conclusions are robust with respect to a wide range of changes in our basic setting that would account for more realistic trading patterns .",
    "secondly , it is reasonable to expect that prices will adjust ",
    "i.e. deflate  as a result of a diminished demand caused by the lack of liquidity . within our model ,",
    "the inclusion of price adjustment , occurring on a slower time - scale than trading activity , would reduce the ratio @xmath165 ( between total value of goods and total wealth ) , but it would also change the wealth distribution .",
    "since the freezing phase transition occurs irrespective of the ratio @xmath165 , the first effect , though it might alleviate the problem , would not change our main conclusion .",
    "the second would make it more compelling , because cash would not depreciate as prices do , so deflation would leave wealthy agents  who hold most of the cash  even richer compared to the cash deprived agents , that would suffer the most from deflation .",
    "so while price adjustment apparently increases liquidity , this may promote further inequality , that would curtail liquidity further .",
    "finally , can the liquidity freeze be avoided by allowing agents to borrow ?",
    "access to credit , we believe , will hardly improve the situation .",
    "] , in line with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and for similar reasons .",
    "credit may mitigate illiquidity in the short term , but cash deprived agents should borrow from wealthier ones . with positive interest rates , this would make inequality even larger in the long run . so credit is likely to make things worse , in line with the arguments in @xcite .",
    "therefore , even though the model presented here can be enriched in many ways , we do nt see a way in which the relation between inequality and liquidity could be reversed .",
    "corroborating the present model with empirical data goes beyond the scope of the present paper , yet we remark that our findings are consistent with the recent economic trends , as shown in figure [ fig : data ] . for example",
    ", it is worth observing that , alongside with increasing levels of inequality , trade has slowed down after the 2008 crisis .",
    "more generally , avoiding deflation -or promoting inflation- has been a major target of monetary policies after 2008 , which one could take as an indirect evidence of the slowing down of the economy .",
    "furthermore , the fact that inequality hampers liquidity and hence promotes demand for credit suggests that the boom in credit market before 2008 and the increasing levels of inequality might not have been a coincidence .",
    "an interesting side note is that the concentration of capital in the top agents goes hand in hand with a flow of cash to the top .",
    "indeed , in our model an injection of extra capital in the lower part of the wealth pyramid the so - called _ helicopter money _ policy is necessarily followed by a flow of this extra cash to the top , via many intermediate agents , thus generating many transactions on the way . this _ trickle up _",
    "dynamics should be contrasted with the usual idea of the _ trickle down _ policy , which advocates injections of money to the top in order to boost investment . in this respect , it is tempting to relate our findings to the recent debate on quantitative easing measures , and in particular to the proposal that the ( european ) central bank should finance households ( or small businesses ) rather than financial institutions in order to stimulate the economy and raise inflation @xcite .",
    "clearly , our results support the helicopter money policy , because injecting cash at the top does not disengages the economy from a liquidity stall .",
    "extending our minimal model to take into account the endogenous dynamics of the wealth distribution and of prices , accounting for investment and credit , is an interesting avenue of future research , for which the present work sets the stage . in particular",
    ", this could shed light on understanding the conditions under which the positive feedback between returns on investment and inequality , that lies at the very core of the dynamics which has produced ever increasing levels of inequality according to @xcite , sets in .",
