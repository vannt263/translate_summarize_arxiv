    "colloidal quantum dots ( qds ) are semiconducting crystals with sizes in the range from a few to hundred of nanometers @xcite .",
    "they are bright and photo - stable with a broad excitation spectrum and a narrow emission spectrum , normally distributed around a specific wavelength @xmath0 . because of the high quantum yield and low bleaching , qds have a broad range of applications in the investigation of biological systems@xcite , e.g , single - particle tracking of individual receptors in a cell membrane @xcite and in vivo imaging @xcite .",
    "optical tweezers are often used to trap and manipulate nanometer - sized particles , the interest arises from the fact that the nanoparticles serve as excellent handles for investigations of individual biomolecules . within the recent years",
    "there have been several reports on optical trapping of metallic nano - particles @xcite with dimensions down to 8 nm .",
    "qd are among the nanoparticles with inducible dipole moments which can be optically trapped by an individual infrared relatively weak laserbeam @xcite . from knowledge of the thermal fluctuations of the nanoparticle within the trap",
    ", one can deduce the trapping force acting on the quantum dot and the polarization of the particle @xcite .",
    "qds can be exited by two - photon absorption of infrared laser light which simultaneously traps the qds .",
    "the absorption does not alter the trapping properties , e.g. , the spring constant , in any pronounced way @xcite .",
    "two - photon absorption of the trapping laser light does give rise to bleaching of qds .",
    "however , bleaching is more rapid if the qds in addition to the trapping laser are illuminated by a hg lamp @xcite . hence , it is beneficial to only use a single light source for both trapping and excitation .",
    "it is custom to perform force calibrations in order to quantitatively measure forces present in trapping assays .",
    "one common way to do this is through power spectral analysis @xcite .",
    "this can be combined with allan variance analysis which provides information concerning the optimal time window to perform force calibrations and system measurements , and which also serves as a method to minimize force contributions in the experimental setting @xcite .    here",
    ", we show how the optical trapping properties of individual qds vary as a function of qd emission wavelength , the emission wavelength being closely related to the physical size of the qd . also , we perform an allan variance analysis of the time series originating from the optical trapping experiment , this analysis revealing the optimal calibration window and quality of the experimental setting . finally , we present an example of how to use individual qds as markers of single molecule systems .",
    "we used qds were as tracer particles of dna tethered particle method ( tpm ) and the analysis revealed that this small tracer particle had a minimum of influence on the dynamics of the dna tether .",
    "it is important to correctly choose the qd such that it matches the given experimental goals and conditions , e.g. , available excitation lasers and filter cubes .",
    "therefore , the optical trapping properties of qds were determined as a function of emission wavelength or size .",
    "the optical trap was based on a 1064 cw laser implemented in an inverted leica sp5 microscope , details regarding the experimental settings are given in references @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : tem ] shows tem images of the qds investigated in the present study .    [ fig : subfigureexample ]    it is well established that the optical tweezers exert a harmonic force on the trapped particle : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the trap stiffness and @xmath3 is the position of the particle with respect to the center of the trap .",
    "to quantify @xmath2 and hence find the range of optical forces exertable on a qd we performed a power spectral analysis of the time series using the routines described in reference @xcite .",
    "the distance between the qd and the cover slide surface was very large in comparison to the radius of the qd , and we approximated the overall shape of the qd as a sphere .",
    "hence , the drag coefficient , @xmath4 , can be found by stoke s law , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the effective diameter of the qd .",
    "the equation of motion of a particle performing brownian fluctuations inside an optical trap at low reynolds number in one direction is : @xmath7 where * f*(t ) is a stochastic force resulting from the thermal motion of the media surrounding the trapped particle .",
    "fourier transformation of the equation of motion gives the positional power spectrum which follows a lorentzian function : @xmath8 where @xmath4 is the drag coefficient and the corner frequency is denoted @xmath9 .",
    "the corner frequency distinguishes the plateau region of slow fluctuations and the region with a scaling exponent of @xmath10 .",
    "this is the characteristic of brownian motion for rapid fluctuations .",
    "@xmath9 is related to @xmath2 and to @xmath4 of the qd : @xmath11 .",

    "[ fig : kappa4 ] indicates that @xmath2 could be increasing as a function of qd size .",

    "allan variance analysis is a method to quantify noise . in comparison to power spectral analysis",
    "it is in particular well suited to pinpoint low - frequency noise .",
    "in contrast to the normal variance , allan variance converges for most of the naturally occuring types of noise . through allan variance analysis",
    "one can determine the optimal time for a measurement or calibraion , this is the time where the advantage of drawing additional points from a gaussian position distribution is overcome by the drift inherently present in a real experiment .",
    "for a timeseries of @xmath15 elements and a total measurement time of @xmath16 the allan variance , @xmath17 , is defined as follows @xcite : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the mean of a time interval of length @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the number of elements in this particular interval . in words , the allan variance is half the averaged squared mean of neighboring intervals each of length @xmath22 .    the allan deviation , @xmath23 , of an optically trapped 655 nm qd w is plotted in fig .",

    "[ fig : allandevqd ] is elongated ( @xmath27 24 x 40 nm@xmath28 ) , and the straight lines on the figure denote the thermal limits of particles with sizes of 6 nm , 12 nm , 24 nm , and 40 nm , respectively .",
    "the larger the particle , the less its thermal diffusion , the lower the thermal limit . also shown in the figure is the limitation originating from the binning of data on the acquisition card ( pci m-6251 , national instruments ) .",
    "this sets a technical limit to a measurable accuracy .",
    "the allan variance of the 655 qd in both lateral directions fall just above the thermal limit for a 24 nm particle , hence , not much noise is present , the equipment is performing very well . at present",
    "we do not know the orientation of an elongated qd within the optical trap .",
    "it is possible that it orients along the electrical field of the trap as is the case for an optically trapped gold nanorod @xcite .",
    "the optimal measurement time ( @xmath22 = 0.3 seconds ) for a trapped colloidal qd is fairly short in comparison to , e.g. , the optimal measurement time for a micron - sized polystyrene bead ( @xmath26 2 - 5 seconds ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is significantly longer than the optimal measurement time for a gold nanorod ( @xmath26 0.05 seconds ) @xcite , despite the fact that the trap stiffness for a gold nanorod is essentially identical to the trap stiffness for a colloidal qd @xcite .",
    "their small size , low bleaching , and high quantum yield make qds ideal tracker particles for assays that rely on the tethered particle method ( tpm ) .",

    "the equation of motion of a particle ( with low reynolds number ) tethered to a surface and performing brownian fluctuations is ( in one dimension ) : @xmath30 where * * f**@xmath31 is the force exerted by the dna tether on the particle .",
    "the first term on the right hand side depends linearly on the radius , @xmath32 , of the tethered particle .",
    "hence , for small particles the brownian motion is dominated by the macromolecule and not by the tracer particle .",
    "the proximity of the tethered particle to the anchoring surface affects both the interpretation of the tethered particle s motion and the possible conformations of the tethering macromolecule @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the tracer particle does not dominate the dynamics of the tethering macromolecule when its radius , @xmath33 , fulfills @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the kuhn length and @xmath15 the number of segments .",

    "it has a value 294 nm for the 605 nm qd .",
    "hence , with a qd tracer particle we are in the limit where movements of the tracer is dominated by the tethering dna .",
    "the double stranded dna tether had a length of 1.36 @xmath29 m , biotin was specifically attached to one end and digoxygenin to the other end .",
    "complete information regarding the preparation of the dna is found in reference @xcite .",
    "sample chambers were prepared with an anti - digoxygenin - coating which would bind to the digoxygenin end of the dna tether .",
    "after incubation with 0.1 nm dna in te ( 10 mm tris - hcl and 1 mm edta ) buffer the samples were incubated with streptavidin - coated qds ( invitrogen ) in te buffer that would bind to the biotin - end of the dna .",
    "the solution was then interchanged with te buffer containing 2 mg / ml @xmath36-casein and the samples were sealed with vacuum grease .",
    "the qds were excited using a hg lamp .",
    "images of the samples were collected with a cooled electron - multiplying ccd ( andor ixon ) with a rate of 10/s .",
    "the image sequences were analyzed with the particle tracker routine spottracker2d @xcite , available as plug - in for imagej .",
    "the coordinates of the qd were extracted through a tiff - stack .",
    "to discriminate multi - tether events only symmetric in - plane motion about the anchor point were regarded .",
    "the second moments of the positions give the co - variance matrix : @xmath37 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the positions in the two directions in the projected plane , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are average displacements around the anchor point , and @xmath15 is the total number of frames .",
    "if the dynamics of the tracer particle were perfectly symmetric , the eigenvalues of this matrix @xmath40 would be equal .",
    "our criterion for symmetry was @xmath41 1.1 @xcite .",

    "in addition to the symmetry criterion we had a lower limit on the rms displacement , this is in order to remove those data sets where multiple ( more than two ) tethers attach to an individual qd , or the qd is unspecifically bound to the lower cover slide . in conclusion , we only consider those datasets for which rms @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the contour length of the tether .",
