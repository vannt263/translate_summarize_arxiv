    "young @xcite and laplace @xcite studied soap bubbles . by taking the minimum of the free energy @xmath5",
    ", they obtained @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the osmotic pressure ( pressure difference between outer and inner sides ) of a soap bubble and @xmath8 is the volume enclosed by the bubble .",
    "we can only observe spherical bubbles because `` an embedded surface with constant mean curvature in 3-dimensional ( 3d ) euclidian space ( @xmath9 ) must be a spherical surface '' @xcite . in 1812 , poisson @xcite considered a solid shell and put forward the free energy @xmath10 .",
    "its euler - lagrange equation is @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "now the solutions to this equation are called willmore surfaces . in 1973",
    ", helfrich recognized that lipid bilayers could be regarded as smectic - a ( sma ) liquid crystals ( lcs ) at room temperature .",
    "based on the elastic theory of liquid crystals @xcite , he proposed the curvature energy per unit area of the bilayer @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are elastic constants . @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 are gaussian curvature and spontaneous curvature of the lipid bilayer , respectively . starting with helfrich s curvature energy ( [ helfrich ] )",
    ", the morphology of lipid vesicles has been deeply understood @xcite . especially , the free energy is expressed as @xmath17 for lipid vesicles , and the corresponding euler - lagrange equation is @xcite : @xmath18 for an open lipid bilayer with a free edge @xmath19 , the free energy is expressed as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the line tension of the edge .",

    "the boundary conditions are available for open lipid bilayers with more than one edge because the edge in our derivation @xcite is a general one .    secondly , we turn to the puzzle about the formation of focal conic structures in sma lcs . as we imagine , the configuration of minimum energy in sma lcs is a flat layer structure .",
    "but dupin cyclides are usually formed when lcs cool from isotropic phase to sma phase in the experiment @xcite .",
    "why the cyclides are preferred to other geometrical structures under the preservation of the interlayer spacing @xcite ? this phenomenon can be understood by the concept that the gibbs free energy difference between isotropic and sma phases must be balanced by the curvature elastic energy of sma layers @xcite .",
    "the total free energy includes curvature energy , volume energy and surface energy .",

    "the new operator @xmath30 can be found in in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thirdly , let us see carbon related structures .",
    "there are three typical structures composed of carbon atoms : buckyball ( c@xmath31 ) , single - walled carbon nanotube ( swnt ) , and carbon torus . in the continuum limit",

    "the total free energy of a graphite layer is @xmath34 { \\mathrm{d}}a + \\lambda\\int { \\mathrm{d}}a$ ] , where @xmath3 is the surface energy per unit area for graphite .",
    "please note that the surface energy per unit area for solid structures is not as a constant quantity as the surface tension for fluid membranes .",
