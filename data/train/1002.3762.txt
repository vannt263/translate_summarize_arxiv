    "let @xmath0 be a many - sorted first - order topological structure in the sense of @xcite .",
    "so for each sort @xmath1 of @xmath0 there is a distinguished formula @xmath2 such that @xmath3 is of sort @xmath1 and the family of definable sets obtained by varying the parameters @xmath4 forms a basis for a topology on @xmath5 ( where @xmath5 is the set of realisations of the sort @xmath1 ) .",
    "when we speak of a set being definable in @xmath0 we mean that it is a subset of some product @xmath6 and that it is first - order definable over some parameters .",
    "each product @xmath6 is equipped with the appropriate product topology and so it makes sense to ask , for any definable set , whether or not it is open . throughout this paper @xmath7",
    "is an expansion of @xmath0 in which there are no new sorts .",
    "we consider the question `` when is it the case that every open set definable in @xmath7 is definable in @xmath0 ? '' .",
    "this question is inspired by recent work of dolich , miller and steinhorn in @xcite and @xcite on the property of having o - minimal open core .",
    "this property makes sense in the special case where @xmath0 is a one - sorted expansion of a model of the theory of dense linear orderings without endpoints and @xmath8 is `` @xmath9 '' .",
    "the open core of such an @xmath0 is a relational structure which has the same underlying set as @xmath0 and a predicate for each open set which is definable in @xmath0 .",
    "the property of having o - minimal open core is an interesting generalisation of o - minimality which is studied extensively in @xcite .",
    "there is also earlier work of miller and speissegger in @xcite .",
    "two important classes of structures which are not o - minimal but which have o - minimal open core receive special attention in @xcite .",
    "they are dense pairs of o - minimal ordered groups , as studied by van den dries in @xcite , and expansions of o - minimal structures by a generic predicate , in the sense of chatzidakis and pillay in @xcite . in both cases",
    "the structure arises as an expansion of an o - minimal structure and it is proved in @xcite that every open set definable in the expansion is definable in the original structure .",
    "so the question which we are addressing is intimately connected with the issue of having o - minimal open core .",
    "our answer has the benefit of working outside the ordered setting .",
    "we assume throughout that @xmath7 is @xmath10-saturated and strongly @xmath10-homogeneous for some sufficiently large @xmath10 .",

    "we denote by @xmath16 the subset of @xmath6 defined by the formula @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",

    "+ assumption ( i ) : for any sorts @xmath19 of @xmath0 and @xmath20 such that @xmath21 is open , @xmath22 has non - empty interior . + assumption ( ii ) : for any sorts @xmath19 of @xmath0 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 is open .",
    "+ under assumption ( i ) we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for it to be the case that every open set definable over @xmath11 in @xmath7 is definable over @xmath11 in @xmath0 .",
    "this is theorem [ two ] . using somewhat similar methods",
    "we show that , under assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) , it is enough to consider only open sets @xmath21 such that @xmath21 is equal to the interior of its closure .",
    "this is theorem [ three ] .    in section 3",
    "we apply theorems [ two ] and [ three ] to classes of expansions which resemble the dense pairs of o - minimal ordered groups studied in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we answer a question from @xcite about lovely pairs of dense o - minimal structures and prove that every open set definable in @xmath25 is definable in @xmath26 . outside",
    "the ordered setting we prove that every open set definable in a lovely pair of henselian valued fields of characteristic zero ( and arbitrary residue field characteristic ) is definable in the underlying henselian valued field .",
    "in section 4 we assume @xmath27 is an expansion of @xmath0 by a generic predicate in the sense of @xcite .",
    "it is established in @xcite that if @xmath0 is an o - minimal expansion of a model of the theory of dense linear orderings without endpoints and @xmath8 is `` @xmath9 '' then every open set definable in @xmath28 is definable in @xmath0 .",
