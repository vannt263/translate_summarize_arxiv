    "models of large ecosystems form an important class of dynamical systems generating complicated patterns and strange ( chaotic ) attractors . however , modeling these large systems is made difficult by rapid , small scale biological evolution and gaps in observations to use for comparison . also , there is uncertainty in how to set up reliable experiments on such ecosystems .",
    "a well studied example is the ocean ecosystem , where the main resource for many species is phytoplankton .",
    "phytoplankton plays an important role in the dynamics of the climate system through the oceanic carbon cycle by removing about half of all carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "previous studies  @xcite have shown that phytoplankton communities respond to climate warming through changes in diversity and productivity .",
    "however , it was determined  @xcite that changing the climate temperature directly impacts the chemical cycles in plankton , affecting the system as much as nutrients and light .",
    "another example where environmental temperature may be related to the dynamics of the plankton ecosystem is the very recent appearance of a _ fall _ phytoplankton bloom in the arctic ocean@xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous observations , the new plankton dynamics may be approaching a possible bistable regime , where plankton bloom not only during the spring time , but in early fall as well .",
    "this in turn could affect surface ocean temperature and delay sea ice re - freezing .",
    "also , an unusual massive phytoplankton bloom which has been found _ underneath _ the arctic ice pack in the chukchi sea  @xcite may correlate with planetary warming . thus , theoretical investigation of the dynamical properties of large ecosystems under external forcing makes a significant contribution to understanding properties of the ecosystems as well as the climate system .",
    "we consider here a new phytoplankton model , which takes into account resources , self - limitation effects , and species extinctions .",
    "the model parameters depend on the state of the environment via time dependent coefficients .",
    "this system is connected with some phytoplankton models , and under certain assumptions can be derived from them .",
    "if the resource turnover rate is large enough , the model reduces to a lotka - volterra system  @xcite .",
    "if we remove self - limitation effects for the lotka - volterra system , one finds  @xcite that a single species can survive only in an ecosystem for certain fixed climate parameters .",
    "biologically , it is the exclusion principle . in the framework of the phytoplankton model , it is the so - called _ plankton paradox _ studied in many interesting works  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in contrast to the exclusion principle , we observe the coexistence of many plankton species sharing the same niche .",
    "numerical simulations  @xcite have shown that in such systems chaos and unpredictable behavior occur . in the papers   @xcite it was shown that a temporal variability of the nutrient supply can lead to coexistence of species .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the model of huisman and weissing  @xcite by introducing self - limitation for species and species extinctions .",
    "such an extended model can describe the coexistence of many species when self - regulation is stronger than species competition .",
    "our primary goal is to compare the two following situations : a ) system with fixed parameters ; b ) the same system with time dependent parameters . in case",
    "b we consider two situations : time periodic oscillations and time chaotic ones .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we state the standard model of species coexistence .",
    "further , we prove a general assertion on attractor existence for this model . for the case of a single resource",
    "we show that the global attractor consists of equilibria and derive an equation for species abundances . for large turnover @xmath0",
    "this equation has a simple asymptotic solution .    in section iii",
    "we introduce the new extended model , which takes into account species extinctions and time oscillations of the resource @xmath1 .",
    "we also prove the existence of a compact global attractor when @xmath2 . for the model with time dependent parameters",
    "we describe two situations where we can find asymptotic solutions . in section",
    "iv we describe the results of numerical simulations .",
    "we consider the following standard model of plankton biodiversity  @xcite : @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 are michaelis - menten s functions , @xmath6 are species abundances , @xmath7 are the species mortalities , @xmath0 is the resource turnover rate , @xmath1 is the supply of resource @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the content of the resource in the @xmath10-th species .",
    "these constants define how different species share resources .",
    "note that if @xmath11 then the equation for @xmath8 becomes trivial and @xmath12 for large times @xmath13 , i.e. , the resource equals the resource supply .",
    "the terms @xmath14 define self - regulation of species populations that restrict the species abundances , and @xmath15 with @xmath16 define a possible competition between species for resources .",
    "the coefficients @xmath17 are specific growth rates and the @xmath18 are self - saturation constants .",
    "the coefficients @xmath9 determine how the species share the resource ( nutrient supply ) .",
    "it is natural thus to assume that @xmath19    when @xmath20 this system is equivalent to those in works where the plankton paradox  @xcite is studied ( see the previous section ) . for the case of @xmath21 resources",
    "we have more complicated equations @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this model is widely used for primary producers like phytoplankton and it can also be applied to describe competition for terrestrial plants @xcite . relation ( [ mm2 ] ) corresponds to the von liebig minimum law , but we can consider even more general @xmath28 satisfying the conditions @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a positive constant , and @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the boundary of the positive cone @xmath33 .",
    "note that condition ( [ mm2b ] ) holds if @xmath28 are defined by ( [ mm2 ] ) .",
    "similarly as above , we assume that @xmath34      let us first describe some sufficient conditions which guarantee that systems ( [ hx11 ] ) , ( [ hv11 ] ) and ( [ hx2 ] ) , ( [ hv2 ] ) are dissipative and have a global attractor . define the matrix @xmath35 with the entries @xmath36 to satisfy the following condition ( this is a classical assumption  @xcite ) :    * assumption . * _ the matrix @xmath37 with the entries @xmath36 has a positive dominant diagonal : @xmath38 _ this assumption means that species self - regulation is stronger than competition between species .",
    "then , we can assert that the solutions to ( [ hx2 ] ) , ( [ hv2 ] ) are non - negative and bounded .",
    "[ lsm1 ] assume the @xmath28 satisfy ( [ mm2a ] ) .",
    "let us consider for ( [ hx2 ] ) , ( [ hv2 ] ) the cauchy problem with positive initial data for @xmath39 and bounded positive initial resources @xmath40 then solutions of this cauchy problem are positive and a priori bounded , that is , @xmath41 where the @xmath42 are positive constants .",
    "* proof*. the proof is standard .",
    "let us prove that @xmath43 .",
    "assume that this fact is violated .",
    "then there exists an index @xmath44 and a time @xmath45 such that @xmath46 condition ( [ mm2b ] ) entails that the term @xmath47 equals zero .",
    "then we substitute these inequalities into the @xmath44-th equation ( [ hv2 ] ) and obtain a contradiction .    in a similar way",
    ", we can prove that @xmath48 .",
    "here , we use the positivity of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 which implies @xmath51 positivity of @xmath6 follows from the fact that the @xmath10-th right hand side of system ( [ hx2 ] ) is proportional to @xmath6 , thus , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a function .",
    "let us prove that @xmath54 for some @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 .",
    "let us estimate @xmath57 for large @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 be an index such that @xmath60 . according to ( [ mm2a ] )",
    "the @xmath61 are uniformly bounded by @xmath62 .",
    "therefore within any open interval , where @xmath63 is fixed , one has @xmath64 where @xmath65 due to assumption ( [ gamm ] ) on @xmath35 . thus",
    ", if @xmath58 is large enough , @xmath66 is a negative number and @xmath67 .",
    "thus @xmath58 is bounded , which completes the proof .",
    "we then obtain the following corollary .",
    "[ lsm2]under the conditions of the previous lemma , system ( [ hx2 ] ) , ( [ hv2 ] ) is dissipative and has a compact global attractor .      on the attractor structure",
    ", one can say more for the particular case ( [ hx11 ] ) , ( [ hv11 ] ) . numerical simulations for this system show that all trajectories tend to equilibria . to understand this fact ,",
    "let us recall the fundamental concept of cooperative systems@xcite .",
    "the condition which determines a cooperative system @xcite does not hold for ( [ hx11 ] ) , ( [ hv11 ] ) but if we change variables to @xmath68 , then in the new variables in this system become cooperative .",
    "this fact implies that all local attractors are stable equilibria .",
    "the stable rest points @xmath69 of systems ( [ hx11 ] ) and ( [ hv11 ] ) can be found as follows .",
    "let us set , for simplicity , that @xmath70    setting @xmath71 in ( [ hx11 ] ) , we obtain @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes @xmath74 .",
    "this gives the following nonlinear equation for @xmath75 : @xmath76 this equation has an asymptotic solution for large turnovers @xmath77 .",
    "we obtain @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    "we extend system ( [ hx2 ] ) and ( [ hv2 ] ) to describe two important effects .",
    "the first effect is species extinctions . in reality abundances @xmath6",
    "are discrete numbers , therefore , if the abundance becomes too small , the corresponding species must become extinct . to describe this effect mathematically",
    ", we introduce a parameter @xmath80 and suppose that if the @xmath10-th species abundance @xmath81 becomes less than @xmath82 , i.e. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 for some @xmath10 and @xmath85 , then the corresponding species should be excluded from systems ( [ hx2 ] ) and ( [ hv2 ] ) .",
    "we then set formally that @xmath86 for all @xmath87 .",
    "note that after this modification the model stays mathematically well posed .",
    "in fact , let us introduce a function @xmath88 , which is the number of surviving species at time @xmath13 , i.e. the number of indices @xmath10 such that @xmath89 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath88 is a piecewise constant non - increasing function .",
    "let @xmath90 be the points of discontinuity of this function . within the intervals",
    "@xmath91 $ ] the cauchy problem for systems ( [ hx2 ] ) and ( [ hv2 ] ) is well posed therefore the cauchy problem is well posed for the modified systems ( [ hx2 ] ) and ( [ hv2 ] ) with extinctions .",
    "there are two possible situations . if @xmath92 , then all the species vanish .",
    "if @xmath93 , then on some infinite semiaxis @xmath94 the modified system is equivalent to the standard model , which has a compact global attractor . therefore , in this case the modified model also has a compact global attractor .",
    "the time @xmath95 when at least one species with @xmath96 exists is called the survival time .",
    "the second effect is a result of climate ( environmental ) influence on the dynamics of the modified systems ( [ hx2 ] ) and ( [ hv2 ] ) and species extinctions . to introduce dependence on the climate state ( for example , on the average environmental temperature @xmath97 ) we can assume that the resource depends on @xmath97 and that t is a periodic function of time",
    ". we also include stochastic effects .",
    "for example , we can suppose that @xmath98 where @xmath99 are parameters , @xmath100 is a frequency , @xmath101 is standard white noise and and @xmath102 is the noise amplitude .",
    "this means that the temperature changes periodically in time .",
    "the parameter @xmath103 is a mean nutrient supply ( resource ) , whereas the parameter @xmath104 describes the intensity of periodic forcing .    to simulate chaotic time forcing we set @xmath105 where the function @xmath106 can be obtained by chaotic trajectories of the lorenz system , a rough model of atmospheric dynamics given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 are parameters and",
    "@xmath109 is a parameter that controls the speed of the trajectories .",
    "this system shows chaotic behaviour for @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we construct @xmath106 as follows .",
    "the third component @xmath112 in ( [ a.12 ] ) describes the time evolution of temperature .",
    "we set @xmath113 , where @xmath114 on a large interval @xmath115 $ ] and @xmath116 is the average of @xmath117 on this interval .",
    "the time extended model reduces to the time independent model with constant @xmath1 in the two opposite cases : ( * a * ) @xmath118 and ( * b * ) @xmath119 .",
    "assume @xmath120 is defined by ( [ supplyper ] ) . in case",
    "( * a * ) , we can apply the averaging principle to ( [ hx11 ] ) , ( [ hv11 ] ) and replace @xmath121 by @xmath103 in ( [ hv11 ] ) .",
    "this averaging also works for @xmath121 defined by ( [ supplychaos ] ) .",
    "the number @xmath122 of coexisting species tends to a constant for large @xmath13 .",
    "this asymptotic approach is confirmed by numerical results in a large diapason of parameter values ( see the next section ) .    in case (",
    "* b * ) we introduce a slow time @xmath123 and use the quasistationary approximation .",
    "then we obtain that the equilibria @xmath124 are functions of slow time .",
    "the number @xmath125 of coexisting species is also a function of @xmath126 .",
    "note that @xmath125 is a measure of biodiversity .",

    "we assume that @xmath128 ( the case of a large ecosystem ) and @xmath129 is distributed randomly according to a lognormal law with parameters @xmath130 .",

    "case @xmath142 is the situation when the environment does not influence the system . in case",
    "2 @xmath125 is always above that of case 1 , this implies that the time oscillating recourse diminishes biodiversity .",
    "4 shows the dependence of the number @xmath125 on the speed parameter @xmath154 when the resource @xmath121 evolves chaotically according to ( [ a.12 ] ) .",
    "we observe that the biodiversity is a decreasing function of the speed parameter .",
    "this decrease depends on the averaged supply level @xmath103 , for larger @xmath103 the effect is weaker .     of coexisting species on the parameter @xmath154 in the case of chaotic supply dynamics defined by ( [ a.12 ] ) .",
    "the time interval @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 . ]    finally , the numerical and analytical results are as follows . for large values of @xmath103 and @xmath158 ,",
    "when the period of time oscillations is much less , the system defined by ( [ hx11 ] ) , ( [ hv11 ] ) shows formidable stability even for @xmath159 close to @xmath103 .",
    "the periodic and chaotic oscillations always decrease biodiversity , but the effect on coexisting species is small : the numbers @xmath143 remain close or they coincide . to obtain diminishing biodiversity , it is necessary to take @xmath160 which corresponds to the case of very strong oscillation . in seldom situations ,",
    "the counterintuitive effect of biodiversity increasing under oscillations is possible .",
    "it may happen when the averaged resource @xmath103 is not large ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "note that this effect can be explained .",
    "in fact , the time oscillations and increasing supply can conserve some species which were close to extinction .",
    "in this paper , a resource model for phytoplankton species is developed , which generalizes the well known model  @xcite and takes into account species self - regulation , extinctions , and time dependence of resources .",
    "such conceptual models describe a simple and easily understandable mechanism for resource competition . for the case of fixed parameters , a general assertion on attractor existence for this model is proved .",
    "the sufficient condition of the attractor existence is that species self - regulation is stronger than the species competition . for the case of a single resource the large time behaviour of solutions",
    "can be described since then the system is cooperative .",
    "we find that all local attractors are stable steady points .",
    "these points can be found from a simple nonlinear equation for the equilibrium resource level . for large supply turnovers we find an asymptotic solutions of this equation .",
    "in the case of time dependent resource oscillations two regimes are found which can be investigated analytically .",
    "the first regime describes fast oscillations",
    ". then one can proceed by averaging the resource over time .",
    "the second regime arises when the resources change slowly , here we use the quasistationary approximation .",
    "the numerical results show that when the averaged supply level is large enough , sufficiently fast resource time oscillations do not affect essential biodiversity , i.e. , the number of coexisting species .",
    "this result is valid both for chaotic and periodic oscillations .",
    "the effect of oscillations becomes observable when the averaged resource value is sufficiently small .",
    "then , typically , the oscillations ( both chaotic and periodic ) diminish biodiversity , however , in some cases oscillations with a noise component can increase biodiversity .",
    "these results can be interesting for the biodiversity problem , where new ideas have been proposed recently ( see  @xcite and also references therein ) .",
    "some ecologists emphasized the roles of competition and environmental interactions in ecological system structure ( niche theory ) .",
    "this niche model considers ecological selection as a driving force of ecosystem evolution .",
    "in contrast , so - called neutral models assume an equivalency between species and the role of stochasticity . in",
    "@xcite it is shown that a transition is possible between two models , niche and neutral .",
    "the model  @xcite involves three terms : a term describing a species immigration into communities from a large regional species pool , a term that limits a species population to its carrying capacity and a stochastic force .",
    "our model also includes different terms .",
    "it involves self - limitation terms and the resource term , which increases species populations but is much more sophisticated than the immigration term .",
    "moreover , we consider noisy periodic and chaotic resourse oscillations instead of purely stochastic forcing  @xcite . instead of immigration",
    ", we consider an inverse process , namely , species extinctions .",
    "our results lead to the conclusion that a chaotically varying environment only affects an ecosystem when the averaged resource level is not large enough .",
    "then the resource rate decrease can lead to a sharp biodiversity decline .",
