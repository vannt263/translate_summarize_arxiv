    "rotation curves of spiral galaxies have been studied for several decades now , and they are a useful tool to show the mass discrepancy in galaxies : the observed kinematics and that predicted from the observed baryonic distribution do not match . either an additional mass component or a modification of gravity are needed . in the recent past , rotation curves have been exploited to test the predictions of cosmological models of structure formation in the universe , such as the currently favoured @xmath2 cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) .",
    "most observations show that the baryons are the main kinematic component in the inner parts and that the so - called `` cuspy '' halos predicted by @xmath2cdm ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 , moore et al . 1999 ,",

    "mond , the modified newtonian dynamics ( milgrom 1983 ) is another successful prescription to predict the rotation curve of a spiral galaxy .",
    "according to mond , the mass discrepancy is not due to an unseen mass component ( the dark matter halo ) , but it is instead the signature of the failure of newtonian gravity to describe the observed kinematics at the low accelerations found in the outer parts of galaxies . in mond , below a certain critical acceleration @xmath3 the newtonian gravity is no longer valid .",
    "earlier concerns about the inconsistency of mond with general relativity are now overcome with the teves theory ( bekenstein 2004 ) .",

    "the modified newtonian dynamics ( milgrom 1983 , see sanders & mcgaugh 2002 for a review ) can be invoked as an alternative to dark matter to explain the observed kinematics of disk galaxies . within the mond framework , the true gravitational acceleration @xmath4 is linked to the newtonian one @xmath5 through the following relation :    @xmath6    [ mondeq ]    where @xmath7 is an interpolation function whose asymptotic values are @xmath8 when @xmath9 and @xmath10 when @xmath11 .",

    "mond correctly predicts general scaling relations linked to rotation curves , such as the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( see mcgaugh 2005 , even though we note that other authors find different slopes , mainly due to different choices of the stellar @xmath24 ratio ) or the mass discrepancy - acceleration relation ( mcgaugh 2004 ) .",
    "pss , from the analysis of a sample of more than 1000 rotation curves , showed that the circular velocity of a disk galaxies at a given radius ( note that they considered rotation curves extended up to 2 optical radii @xmath27 ) can be described as a function of only one parameter , e.g. the total luminosity .",
    "the function which describes the rotation velocity depending only on radius and luminosity is given the name universal rotation curve ( urc ) .",
    "we note that the kinematics of real galaxies depend on other factors too ( such as the surface brightness ) , but the general phenomenological properties of rotation curves can be described well with the luminosity as only parameter .    in detail , the circular velocity @xmath28 at radius @xmath19 can be expressed as a function of @xmath29 ( the circular velocity at @xmath27 ) , and of the stellar and dark contributions @xmath30 and @xmath31 normalised at @xmath29 ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) :    @xmath33    @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 can be in turn expressed as functions of @xmath19 , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the total blue luminosity of the galaxy in question and log @xmath36=10.4 in solar units ) , and @xmath37 kpc :    @xmath38^{1/2 } } ~{\\rm km~s}^{-1 } \\label{vopt}\\ ] ]    @xmath39^{1.43 } } \\label{vdiskn}\\ ] ]    @xmath40    according to pss , eqs .

    "predict the circular velocity of a spiral galaxy at radius @xmath19 with an uncertainty of 4% .",
    "choosing @xmath37 kpc hides any variation of surface brightness for a given luminosity , which results in different rotation curve shapes for galaxies with different surface brightnesses ( see e.g. mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ) .",
    "however , we note that the original formulation of the urc ( with the radius @xmath19 in units of the stellar exponential scale length @xmath41 ) takes this effect into account , since the rotation curves of low- and high - surface brightness galaxies are virtually indistinguishable once the radius is expressed in units of @xmath41 ( e.g. , verheijen & de blok 1999 ) . also , in the urc the contribution of the gaseous disk is ignored .",
    "this is acceptable in the range of luminosities considered by pss because a ) the gasous disk never dominates the kinematics and b ) because of its scaling with the dark matter contribution , its contribution can be implicitely accounted by @xmath42 .",
    "an important feature of the urc is the strong dependence of the logarithmic slope of the rotation curve @xmath43 on the luminosity .",
    "they define @xmath43 in the range @xmath44 : @xmath45 .",
    "fainter galaxies have an increasing rotation curve around @xmath27 , while in the most massive galaxies @xmath46 is already decreasing around @xmath27 .",
    "the question that this paper is addressing is : since both mond and the urc are successful ways to predict the general kinematical properties of disk galaxies , to what extent do they have similar properties ?",
    "one way to compare their properties is to try to derive something like the urc within the framework of mond . in order to achieve this ,",
    "both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are needed . for the former term",
    ", the urc provides us with a recipe to estimate it , while the latter is ignored in the urc .",
    "a rough estimate of @xmath23 can be made through the scaling property of @xmath47 compared to @xmath23 noticed by e.g. bosma ( 1981 ) and hoekstra , van albada & sancisi ( 2001 ) : @xmath48 .",
    "the factor @xmath49 was calculated by performing a linear fit to the observational data in the scaling factor versus luminosity plot ( see fig .",
    "[ scaling ] ) .",
    "the data were taken from the samples of swaters ( 1999 ) and hoekstra et al .",
    "the former work gives r - band luminosities , whereas the urc uses b - band .",
    "the b - band luminosities of the swaters ( 1999 ) sample were calculated from the leda database , when available , and from ned .",
    "the linear fit gives @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we estimated @xmath23 through the following relation : @xmath51",
    ". this turns out to be in line with the findings of swaters ( 1999 ) , who finds @xmath49 to be correlated with surface brightness , and hence with luminosity .",
    "such a scaling of the actual surface density with the gas surface density would happen in the case of a conspicuous amount of disk dark matter , e.g. h@xmath52 in the form of clumps ( pfenniger , combes & martinet 1994 ) or in a cold neutral medium phase ( papadopoulos , thi & viti 2002 ) .",
    "the mond formulas ( eqs .",
    "[ vmond ] and [ vmondnew ] ) were then applied to the @xmath22 and @xmath23 derived above . however , using the face value @xmath22 coming from the urc formulas leads to a mond universal rotation curve that is quite different from the original urc , especially for galaxies where the stellar disk dominates the kinematics . in the lower panels of figs .",
    "[ urc ] and [ urc_new ] the mond curves would lie significantly above the urc curves .",
    "thus , a parameter @xmath53 such that @xmath54 was fitted in order to have the best possible agreement between the urc and the `` mond urc '' , assuming that the scaling of the stellar mass - to - light ratio with luminosity predicted by the urc is correct .",
    "this parameter @xmath53 corresponds to the ratio of the stellar m / l ratios required in mond and the urc frameworks , respectively .",
    "a best - fit value of @xmath55 was found for the standard interpolation function ( eq . [ mond ] ) and a value of @xmath56 for the simple one ( eq . [ mondnew ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with famaey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who compare rotation curve fits made with the two @xmath57 functions considered here are conclude that the simple @xmath57 function gives stellar @xmath24 ratios that are on average @xmath5830% lower than with the standard @xmath57 .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratios are generally not well known in spiral galaxies .",
    "here we considered a conservative estimate of the uncertainties to be 50% ( see de jong & bell 2006 ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the gas scaling factor @xmath49 was taken to be 3.4 , from the scatter in the distribution of @xmath49 shown in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] .",
    "this scatter is large , but it is not possible to find more a accurate way to estimate the scaling factor within the context of the urc , because one would need to consider other parameters ( e.g. the hubble type ) than the luminosity , which are much more difficult to take into account : for instance , in early - type disk galaxies usually there is a central depression in the hi distribution , but its size and magnitude are variable .",
    "moreover , the urc , by construction , has the luminosity as the only parameter varying from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the uncertainties on the baryonic contribution to the rotation curve result in uncertainties on the calculated rotation curves .",
    "they are only rough estimates , since other ( less easily quantifiable ) sources of errors were ignored , such as the presence of the bulge .",
    "these uncertainties on the stellar @xmath24 ratios mean that the disagreement between the mond and urc stellar @xmath24 ratios ( i.e. , @xmath53 being @xmath59 ) does not necessarily imply that the approach of the present paper is incorrect .",
    "moreover , this is in qualitative agreement with the fact that 1 ) in mcgaugh ( 2005 ) the ratio of the `` maximum '' @xmath24 ratio and the mond @xmath24 ratio has a median value of 1.8 , where `` maximum '' in mcgaugh ( 2005 ) is admittedly loosely defined but it is generally taken as a fit where the peak of the rotation curve can be entirely explained by the stellar disk ; and 2 ) the urc has disks close to `` maximum '' ( following the above definition ) for most galaxies apart from the least massive ones .    the urc and the `` mond urc '' ( using @xmath60 ) are compared in fig .",
    "[ urc ] : for the whole range of circular velocities and radii usually sampled by rotation curves , the two datasets display almost identical properties . not surprisingly , the best agreement is found for the range @xmath61 , where most observed rotation curves lie . the worst disagreement is found for the largest distances , in particular in the most massive galaxies .",
    "this has to be expected , though , as the number of data points in this region of the parameter space is quite small : the sample of pss has very few data for large radii of massive galaxies .",
    "indeed , only a minority of the curves come from hi observations ( which trace the kinematics typically out to 2 - 3 @xmath27 ) , and few galaxies are early - type large spirals ( only two galaxies in their sample have type sab or earlier ) .",
    "however , using the uncertainties on the baryonic contribution discussed above , the urc and the mond urc are always in agreement with each other within the errorbars .",
    "also , note that in this paper we ignored the contribution of the bulge , since it was ignored in the urc .",
    "this is likely to have a strong effect on the rotation curves of the largest galaxies .",
    "the same considerations can be made if one uses @xmath62 instead of @xmath60 .",
    "[ urc_new ] shows that the urc and the `` mond urc '' using @xmath62 agree with each other as well as if one uses @xmath60 .",
    "using either interpolation function , the trend in logarithmic slope ( see section [ section_urc ] ) is also reproduced : in the outer parts of the galaxy , the faintest galaxies have a rising rotation curve while the brightest galaxies have a declining rotation curve .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nabla ] , where the logarithmic slope as a function of @xmath29 is displayed .",
    "again , within the uncertainties the two formalisms agree with each other .",
    "mond does not reproduce particularly well the slopes of the most massive galaxies , mainly because of the fact that the bulge is not taken into account .",
    "for consistency with pss we first performed a linear fit of the rotation curves between 0.5 and 1 @xmath27 , then we took the slope at 1 @xmath27 .",
    "the uncertainties on the slopes were computed as the maximum between the propagation of the uncertainties on the rotation curves and a minimum value of 0.1 ( see pss ) .    ) .",
    "the thick black lines represents the urc , the ( less thick ) red and ( thin ) blue lines represent the mond curves , with the standard and simple @xmath57 functions , respectively . , width=321 ]",
    "now that it has been shown that mond can reproduce something which is quite close to the urc , in order to further compare the two phenomena let us have a look if the urc can reproduce one of the main properties linked to mond : the mass discrepancy - acceleration relation .",
    "mcgaugh ( 2004 ) showed that rotation curve data seem to organise themselves along a relation linking the mass discrepancy ( defined as @xmath63 , where @xmath46 is the rotation velocity at radius @xmath19 ) to the gravitational acceleration ( here the newtonian acceleration is used , @xmath64 ) . in the same paper , it is also shown that the stellar @xmath24 ratios arising from the mond fits minimise the scatter in the mass discrepancy - acceleration relation .",
    "[ mda ] shows that using the urc formulas one finds such a relation , whatever choice of baryonic mass is made .",
    "since we are looking for such a relation in the urc context , the mass discrepancy is always computed with respect to the urc rotation curve ( i.e. , in the above definition of @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) .",
    "obviously , using @xmath67 ( whichever @xmath57 is used ) leads to a zero - scatter relation , by construction . a priori the tightness of the relations shown in fig .",
    "[ mda ] comes a bit as a surprise : while in mond a critical acceleration is inbuilt in the theory , in the urc framework there is no such thing , at least in an explicit way .",
    "semi - analytical dark matter models ( e.g. , van den bosch & dalcanton 2000 ) can also reproduce a mass discrepancy - acceleration relation using the right choice of parameters .",
    "however , the main thing to note is that in the present paper the urc gives a mass discrepancy - acceleration relation without any parameter to adjust .    from the lower four panels fig .",
    "[ mda ] one can see that the mass discrepancy - acceleration relation from the urc formulas is consistent with that found by mcgaugh ( 2004 ) with observational data if the baryonic contribution to the rotation curve is chosen to be the same as in section [ murc ] , with @xmath56 or 0.77 .",
    "the former value of @xmath53 slightly overestimates the mass discrepancy ( compared to mcgaugh s points ) for a given newtonian acceleration @xmath5 : this is to be expected because @xmath56 corresponds to the `` simple '' interpolation function , where the full mond regime is reached faster than with the `` standard '' function .",
    "using @xmath55 gives an excellent agreement : it corresponds to the `` standard '' interpolation function , which is what mcgaugh used .",
    "taking the face - value @xmath18 predicted by the urc yields a remarkably tight relation ; the scaling is obviously different , since the stellar @xmath24 ratio is different and the gaseous contribution is ignored .",
    "we also considered different ranges of luminosities : since the urc is defined for @xmath68 km s@xmath69 ( see pss ) , the predicted scaling relations are not expected to hold with high accuracy . indeed , the left panels fig .",
    "[ mda ] show that for @xmath70 km s@xmath69 the innermost few points of the rotation curves start to become discrepant .",
    "one of the main differences between the urc and the mond fits is the stellar @xmath24 ratio : while in the former disks are mostly close to maximum ( following the definition in section [ murc ] ) , the latter yields slightly submaximal disks ( see mcgaugh 2005 ) , which results in a very different scaling in the mass discrepancy - acceleration plane .",
    "again , we note that a limitation of the present approach is that these statements ignore any surface brightness variation at equal luminosity .",
    "a robust , precise and incontrovertible method to determine stellar @xmath24 ratios is yet to be found .",
    "a number of methods have been suggested ( see e.g. de jong & bell 2006 ) , which suggest @xmath24 ratios ranging roughly between half - maximum to maximum disks .",
    "therefore , a distinction between the urc and mond based on the predicted stellar @xmath24 ratios is not viable at the moment .",
    "the fact that the simple @xmath57 function gives lower stellar @xmath24 than the standard one has already been shown by famaey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    in the present paper",
    "the discussion is focussed only on the general properties of spiral galaxies rotation curves .",
    "both mond and the urc are successful ways of describing the overall behaviour of rotation curves , but inevitably there are cases where they fail to reproduce the details in the rotation curves .",
    "also , only a rough estimate of @xmath18 was made in the context of mond , in particular for @xmath23 .",
    "the observed @xmath47/@xmath23 scaling shows considerable variations around the value of @xmath71 that was assumed here . despite these large approximations , the urc and mond exhibit remarkable phenomenological similarities .",
    "a major feature of mond and the urc is that in both frameworks one is able to infer in a reasonably accurate way the general properties of rotation curves based on the amount and distribution of baryonic matter only .",
    "this is closely linked to another property of rotation curves ( sancisi 2003 ) , whereby for any feature in a rotation curve there is a corresponding feature in the baryonic distribution .",
    "the literature is full of such examples , one of the most spectacular being ngc 1560 ( broeils 1992 ) .",
    "this empirical fact is unexpected in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) framework since cdm fits to the rotation curves require strongly submaximal disks , which would cancel this baryon - kinematics coupling that is observed ( see e.g. de blok et al . 2001 , mcgaugh 2004 , gentile et al . 2004 ) .",
    "yet another evidence of the close coupling of baryonic and general properties of spiral galaxies is the observed correlation between stellar exponential scale lengths and halo core radii ( donato , gentile & salucci 2004 ) .",
    "a similar effect can be inferred also within mond ( milgrom & sanders 2005 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the baryon - kinematics coupling is not obvious : possible solutions are that baryons and dark matter are interacting in some unknown way other than gravity in the central parts of galaxies or that a mond - like theory such as teves is the correct theory of gravity .    a possible concern about the approach presented in this paper might have been that the similarity between mond and the urc might actually be an identity .",
    "this is not the case , since even if one assumes the same baryonic contribution in both frameworks ( e.g. the ones considered in section [ murc ] , with either @xmath56 or 0.77 ) , the functional form of the halo contribution in the urc context ( eq . [ vhalon ] ) is completely different from the functional form of the `` pseudo - halo '' contribution in mond ( second term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ vmond ] ) .",
    "as pointed out by salucci & gentile ( 2006 ) , any alternative theory of gravity ( such as mond or mog , see moffat 2006 ) should be able to account for the observed phenomenology of rotation curves . in the present paper we have demonstrated that mond does fairly well , despite the naive expectation of having only flat rotation curves because of the asymptotically flat behaviour of the mond rotation curves .",
    "hence , the mond framework not only usually gives good fits to rotation curves , but it also predicts the correct scaling of the rotation curves properties with luminosity , as shown by the urc .",
    "starting from the consideration that both mond and the universal rotation curve ( urc ) are valid ways to describe the general properties of rotation curves , the two approaches were compared by trying to reproduce one s predictions using the prescriptions of the other one .    the first comparison was made by attempting to reproduce something like the urc in the mond framework . some ( observationally - based ) assumptions on the stellar and gaseous contributions to the rotation curve were made .",
    "it turns out that it is possible to build a `` mond urc '' with very similar properties to the urc .",
    "the mond urc also exhibits the trend in logarithmic slope versus luminosity seen in the urc . both the `` standard '' mond interpolation function and the simple one proposed by famaey & binney ( 2005 ) were tested , with almost identical results .",
    "the second comparison was made by looking for a mass discrepancy - acceleration relation using the urc formulas . with all three choices of baryonic contributions ( @xmath1 ) considered in this paper a tight ( unexpected a priori ) relation arises . using the @xmath1 values that match best the `` mond urc '' to the urc one finds a mass discrepancy - acceleration relation like the observed one .    while these results have no implications as to whether mond is a valid theory of gravity , mond and the urc , even though they are based on totally different assumptions ,",
    "are found to display similar properties and to reproduce each other s predictions well .",

    "<S> the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) and the universal rotation curve ( urc ) are two ways to describe the general properties of rotation curves , with very different approaches concerning dark matter and gravity . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenological similarities between the two approaches are studied by looking for properties predicted in one framework that are also reproducible in the other one .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we looked for the analogous of the urc within the mond framework . </S>",
    "<S> modifying in an observationally - based way the baryonic contribution @xmath0 to the rotation curve predicted by the urc , and applying the mond formulas to this @xmath1 , leads to a `` mond urc '' whose properties are remarkably similar to the urc .    </S>",
    "<S> second , it is shown that the urc predicts a tight mass discrepancy - acceleration relation , which is a natural outcome of mond . with the choice of @xmath1 that minimises the differences between the urc and the `` mond urc '' the relation is almost identical to the observational one .    </S>",
    "<S> this similarity between the observational properties of mond and the urc has no implications about the validity of mond as a theory of gravity , but it shows that it can reproduce in detail the phenomenology of disk galaxies rotation curves , as described by the urc . </S>",
    "<S> mond and the urc , even though they are based on totally different assumptions , are found to have very similar behaviours and to be able to reproduce each other s properties fairly well , even with the simple assumptions made on the luminosity dependence of the baryonic contribution to the rotation curve . </S>"
