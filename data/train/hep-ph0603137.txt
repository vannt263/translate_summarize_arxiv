    "in contrast to a coordinate with a single lorentz index , @xmath1 allows for the construction of an infinite number of lorentz invariant combinations , for example @xmath37 in general , the directions in which these invariants are vanishing differ from one to another .",
    "thus , we seek a function that drops off at large values of all of its arguments and that depends on a sufficient number of these invariants so that no flat directions remain .    the simplest possibility is to work only with the two available quadratic invariants @xmath38 where the numerical factors are introduced for later convenience . to make integration as easy as possible",

    "here we will simply state the important qualitative features . at large distances ,",
    "the coulomb potential is not altered ; this region corresponds to small @xmath70 for which @xmath174 . on the other hand ,",
    "as one approaches the origin , one finds that @xmath175 remains nonsingular .",
    "writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : modpot ] ) as @xmath176 one may use the fact that @xmath177 to see that @xmath178 the last integral is finite and is @xmath179 , for our parameter choice @xmath65 .",
    "hence , the singularity at the origin is not present , a result that one might attribute to the fuzziness of the noncommutative space .",
    "it is important to note that this result is independent of the detailed form of @xmath14 and would be obtained for any weighting function with finite volume in momentum space , since such a function provides an @xmath180 ultraviolet cut - off in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modpot ] ) .",
    "in the theories that we have considered , the lorentz - invariant , noncommutative modification to the tree - level vertices leads to a suppression in scattering cross sections at energies above the typical scale of the new physics .",
    "it is not unreasonable to guess that , at least in some theories , a violation of unitarity in the commutative limit may be cured by the additional high - momentum suppression of the noncommutative vertex . in this subsection",
    ", we will give one example where this is the case , working at tree - level .",
    "consider a theory of two distinguishable fermions , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , with the nonrenormalizable interaction lagrangian @xmath183 we may assume that the fermions have masses @xmath184 and @xmath185 , though we will only be interested in the behavior of the scattering cross sections at high energies , where these masses are irrelevant .    the possible tree - level , two - into - two scattering processes are fermion - anti - fermion annihilation , and the scattering of fermions and/or antifermions of a different type . with the interaction written as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dimsix ] ) ( again with one star product removed ) , the relevant differential cross sections in the center - of - mass frame and in the high - energy limit are given by @xmath186   \\,\\,\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath187 \\,\\,\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath188 \\,\\,\\,,\\ ] ] for @xmath189 .",
    "clearly , for any @xmath190 , these differential cross sections are suppressed in the large @xmath98 limit : the exponential damping of @xmath99 above the noncommutative scale wins over the @xmath191 growth of the commutative result .",
    "this conclusion remains unchanged when one integrates over the center - of - mass scattering angle @xmath112 .",
    "provided that the scale of noncommutativity is not far in the ultraviolet , one can prevent an unlimited growth in the total cross section that would exceed the unitarity bounds . to quantify this",
    ", one may consider the partial wave decomposition @xmath192 where the partial wave amplitudes must satisfy the unitarity constraint @xmath193  @xcite . in all of the examples above , we find that @xmath92-wave unitarity provides the tightest bound , which numerically is consistent with the inequality @xmath194 for our canonical parameter choice @xmath65 .",
    "thus , if @xmath195 is not far below the scale of noncommutative physics , one need not worry that this theory will violate unitarity at tree - level .",
    "in this paper , we have revisited a proposal for constructing lorentz - invariant , noncommutative field theories .",
    "canonical noncommutative field theories involve a lorentz - violating parameter , while nature shows no indication that lorentz - invariance is broken .",
    "experimental limits on the amount of lorentz violation that is tolerable in the low - energy effective theory force the typical energy scale of the noncommutative interactions to be above the center - of - mass energies that can be probed directly in planned collider experiments .",
    "this motivated the proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite to formulate a lorentz - conserving alternative to the canonical models .    as we have reviewed earlier",
    ", this proposal involves extending the coordinate algebra by promoting the noncommutativity parameter of the canonical theories to a fictitious coordinate .",
    "the mapping of this algebra into a field theory is again accomplished through a star product , but the new coordinates are integrated in the action with a weighting factor , which sets the scale of the noncommutative physics .",
    "the resulting four - dimensional effective theory remains lorentz invariant and a function of ordinary coordinates only . unlike previous phenomenological work based on this approach , we have considered theories in which the prescription described for constructing a lorentz - invariant noncommutative theory could be implemented and studied without recourse to a low - momentum expansion . in particular , this allows us to study how cross sections behave as typical energies exceed the noncommutative scale , as we have done in both toy models ( yukawa and @xmath29 theory ) and the more realistic case of noncommutative qed for fields in the lepton sector , where the matter have charges @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "interestingly , we find that cross sections drop quickly as the center - of - mass energy exceeds the noncommutative scale . roughly speaking , the noncommutative vertex modification smears out the point - like interaction so that at high center - of - mass energies the incoming scatterer sees less and less of the target .",
    "equivalently , the prescription for integrating over the fictitious @xmath17 coordinates with the weighting function @xmath14 introduces form - factors in the tree - level vertices of the theory .",
    "as we saw in a number of cases , this also has consequences for the angular distributions of scattering processes , since the various contributions to a scattering amplitude with differing angular dependence in the commutative limit may each receive different noncommutative corrections .",
    "the modifications to the qed processes of dilepton production , bhabha scattering and diphoton production were all presented . while ref .",
    "@xcite evaluated the lowest - order effects of noncommutativity on these processes in one version of noncommutative qed ( which is appropriate for determining the collider bounds on the model ) , the results presented here would be useful for a qualitative comparison to the data if , for example , a @xmath196  tev international linear collider ( ilc ) were to discover and study noncommutative physics at a scale comparable to its center - of - mass energy .    finally , we noted that a modification to a tree - level interaction that suppresses a given cross - section at high center - of - mass energies may alter one s conclusions as to whether the cross section ever violates the constraints from unitarity of the @xmath197-matrix .",
    "we demonstrated this in the case of a simple four - fermion interaction .",
    "since our vertex modification introduces an exponential suppression factor at high @xmath98 , then a theory whose cross section grows only as a power @xmath98 in the commutative limit , will not grow indefinitely in the noncommutative case . using the constraint from partial - wave unitarity",
    ", we obtained a bound on the coefficient of the four - fermion interaction so that the theory would remain unitary for arbitrarily large @xmath98 .",
    "whether this could be an avenue for constructing a new type of higgsless theory is an interesting question , but one that first requires a more tractable , all - orders formulation of noncommutative standard model .",
