    "the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) 050525a is a bright brief flash of gamma - ray radiation detected by the _ swift _",
    "burst alert telescope ( bat ) on 25 may 2005 00:02:53 ( ut ) @xcite .",
    "it showed two peaks , with a duration of @xmath5 in the 15 - 350 kev band @xcite .",
    "fitting to the band spectral model yields a low - energy photon index of @xmath6 and a peak energy of @xmath7 kev @xcite .",
    "the fluence in the 15 - 350 kev band is @xmath8 .",
    "this burst was also detected by other on - board instruments such as integral and konus - wind , with peak fluxes of @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the fluences were @xmath11 in 20 - 200 kev ( for the 12 second integration time ) by integral and @xmath12 by konus - wind in 20 - 1000 kev ( for the 11.5 second integration time ) , respectively .",
    "the time - integrated spectrum shows a peak energy @xmath13 by konus - wind @xcite .",
    "about six minutes later , the rotse iii telescope in namibia was able to obtain images , and detected an optical afterglow of magnitude 14.7 @xcite .",
    "a presumed host galaxy was measured with a redshift of z=0.606 , based on both [ o iii ] 5007 and @xmath14 emission and ca h@xmath15k and ca i 4228 absorption @xcite .",
    "assuming cosmological parameters",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , the isotropic - equivalent gamma - ray energy is about @xmath19 .",
    "the follow - up observations of grb 050525a revealed that the optical afterglow decayed as @xmath20 until about 0.01 days after the burst .",
    "subsequently the afterglow showed a major rebrightening starting at @xmath0 days and ending at @xmath1 days , and then decayed as @xmath21 .",
    "this early - time emission feature is similar to the behavior of external reverse shock emission predicted by the standard fireball - shock model @xcite , which was first confirmed by the detections of early prompt optical emission from grb 990123 @xcite .",
    "the reverse shock model was also suggested to interpret early optical emission of grb 021004 @xcite and grb 021211 @xcite .",
    "besides , the prompt optical - infrared emission from grb 041219a was recently suggested to be the internal shock emission , since a strong correlation between @xmath22-ray and optical - infrared signals was detected @xcite , which further confirmed the standard internal - external - shock model of grbs .",
    "mirabal et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported a break at @xmath23 days in the optical afterglow light curve of grb 050525a . in this paper , we show that the optical afterglow in @xmath23 days after the _ swift _ trigger can be well understood due to the reverse shock emission superposed by the forward shock emission .",
    "the standard model for grbs and their afterglows is the fireball - shock model ( for recent review articles , see mszros 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ; piran 2005 ) .",
    "in this model , the prompt emission of grbs is ascribed to internal shocks and the long - term afterglow to external shocks .",
    "the prompt or very early optical emission is therefore explained as a consequence of the reverse component of the external shocks @xcite .    for shock - accelerated slow - cooling electrons with a power - law distribution ,",
    "the typical spectrum of synchrotron emission is described by three power laws @xcite : ( 1 ) @xmath24 for @xmath25 ; ( 2 ) @xmath26 for @xmath27 ; ( 3 ) @xmath28 for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the typical synchrotron frequency , cooling frequency and peak flux , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is the index of the electron energy distribution .",
    "here we ignore the synchrotron self - absorption because its corresponding frequency may be much less than the optical band of interest .",
    "both a forward shock and a reverse shock emerge when an ultrarelativistic cold grb ejecta with initial lorentz factor of @xmath34 sweeps up a stationary cold interstellar medium : the forward shock propagates into the interstellar medium and the reverse shock propagates back into the ejecta @xcite .",
    "the emission of the forward shock is characterized by @xcite @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where , @xmath39 is the critical times when the break frequency , @xmath40 crosses the observed frequency @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the fraction of the shock energy goes into the magnetic field , @xmath43 is the fraction of the shock energy goes into the electrons , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xcite , @xmath47 is the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy , @xmath48 is the density of interstellar medium in units of 1 @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the redshift of the burst , @xmath51 is the corresponding luminosity distance , and @xmath52 is the observer s time in units of 1 day .",
    "the above equations are valid for @xmath53",
    ". afterglows with the hard electron spectrum of @xmath54 have been discussed by dai & cheng ( 2001 ) .    for reverse shocks",
    ", it is possible to get a simple analytic solution in two limiting cases : thin shell and thick shell ( which are corresponding to newtonian and relativistic reverse shock , respectively ; sari @xmath15 piran , 1995 ) .",
    "since the reverse - shocked gas is separated with the forward - shocked gas by a contact discontinuity , which keeps the equality of pressures and velocities in both shocks , we can find the emission properties of reverse shock in the aid of the correlations between forward and reverse shocks at the crossing time @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "first , since the reverse- and forward - shocked gases have the same magnetic field and lorentz factor at @xmath55 , the cooling frequency of the reverse - shocked electrons is equal to that of the forward - shocked electrons , @xmath56 .",
    "second , the electron s random lorentz factor of the reverse shock is smaller than that of the forward shock by a factor of @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is the lorentz factor of both shocked regions at @xmath55 ) , the typical synchrotron frequency of the reverse shock is by a factor of @xmath59 less than that of the forward shock , @xmath60 .",
    "this is basically valid for the thick shell case .",
    "as for a thin shell , it is more realistic with the expression , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the lorentz factor of the shocked ejecta in the rest frame comoving with the unshocked ejecta at the crossing time and @xmath63 @xcite . third , the peak flux @xmath64 of an emission region is proportional to the electron number , the magnetic field , and the lorentz boost . since at @xmath55 ,",
    "the electron number of the ejected shell is larger than that of the swept - up medium by a factor of @xmath65 , we obtain @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , we can directly write down the corresponding characteristic variables of the reverse shock emission , at @xmath67 , @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 for the thin shell ( i.e. newtonian ) case , and @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 for the thick shell ( i.e. relativistic ) case . here , the grb duration t is given by the shell width @xmath74 , according to the internal shock model .",
    "as derived by sari & piran ( 1999a ) and kobayashi ( 2000 ) , the typical synchrotron frequency and peak flux evolve as @xmath75 , @xmath76 at @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , @xmath79 at @xmath80 , for the thin - shell case ; @xmath81constant , @xmath82 at @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , @xmath85 at @xmath86 , for the thick - shell case . before the crossing time",
    ", the cooling frequency evolve as @xmath87 for the thin - shell case and @xmath88 for the thick - shell case ; after the crossing time , @xmath89 turns into the cutoff frequency due to synchrotron cooling of electrons without acceleration , and it evolves the same as @xmath90 for both cases . according to the emission properties shown above , we derive light curves of the emission from the forward- and reverse - shocked regions and thus can constrain the model parameters by fitting the early afterglow of grb 050525a .",
    "from the emission features described by equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) , we see that the optical band is commonly between the typical frequency @xmath30 and cooling frequency @xmath31 in both forward and reverse shocks around the crossing time .",
    "thus , the optical light curve of grb 050525a can be fitted by the superposition of two broken power - laws : ( 1 ) forward shock : @xmath91 for @xmath92 , and @xmath93 for @xmath94 ; ( 2 ) reverse shock : @xmath95 for @xmath96 , and @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "these scaling laws are valid for the thin - shell case , in which the reverse shock decelerates the shell insignificantly @xcite .    in figure [ fig1 ] we present the r - band afterglow light curve of grb 050525a between may 25.0062 ut ( @xmath99 ) and may 25.5333 ut ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "we find that , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 can fit the light curve well for the component of forward shock emission .",
    "given redshift @xmath104 @xcite , the corresponding luminosity distance is @xmath105 . using equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath106 and @xmath107 furthermore , from the flux inferred by the light curve of the reverse - shock emission ( depicted as a dashed line in figure [ fig1 ] , where we see a flux @xmath108 at @xmath109 ) , using equations ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) , we further obtain @xmath110 by simple algebra from equations ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , we obtain a constraint on the initial lorentz factor of grb ejecta , @xmath111 which is weakly dependent on the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy @xmath47 and interstellar medium density @xmath48 . assuming the efficiency of energy conversion is @xmath112 , @xmath47 is approximately equal to the detected isotropic - equivalent @xmath22-ray energy , i.e. @xmath113 .",
    "thus , we can obtain a mutual constraint between @xmath42 and @xmath43 from equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) . by eliminating the medium density @xmath48",
    ", we have @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , as a natural consequence of @xmath115 , we have @xmath116 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "these constraints are more clear than the cases of grb 990123 @xcite , grb 021004 @xcite and grb 021211 @xcite .",
    "our preliminary fitting to the afterglow observations of grb 050525a update to may 25.5333 ut ( @xmath100 ) is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "additionally , we also give a constraint on the parameters for the thick - shell case .",
    "we can find from a fitting similar to that shown above that , the crossing time of the reverse shock , i.e. , the grb duration @xmath117 is approximated by @xmath118 which is inconsistent with the observed @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "this implies that grb 050525a seems to be a thin - shell case .",
    "the optical afterglow of grb 050525a rebrightened starting at @xmath0 days and ending at @xmath1 days , which was followed by an initial power - law decay . in this paper , we have shown that this early emission feature can be interpreted as the reverse shock emission superposed by the forward shock emission in an interstellar medium environment . a good fitting to the observed light curve is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we further find the initial lorentz factor of the ejecta @xmath2 .",
    "some other model parameters are also constrained : the magnetic energy fraction @xmath3 and the medium density @xmath4 .",
    "these limits are consistent with those from the other very - early optical afterglows observed so far @xcite and with the values of the forward - shock parameters @xcite .",
    "our model is simplified under some assumptions : first , the reverse- and forward - shocked regions have the same electron and magnetic energy fractions , requiring that the ejecta is not initially magnetized .",
    "this requirement seems to be relaxed for grb 990123 @xcite .",
    "the interaction of a magnetized ejecta with its surrounding medium has been investigated in details @xcite .",
    "second , we neglect the effect of inverse compton scattering ( ics ) on the reverse shock emission in  2 .",
    "as shown by wang , dai , & lu ( 2001a , b ) , this effect not only decreases the cooling frequency but also produces higher - energy emission .",
    "however , this decrease does not affect the limits derived above because the cooling frequency is much larger than the optical band at the times of our interest .",
    "third , the surrounding environment is assumed to be a uniform interstellar medium , in which case two types of light curves are expected for the reverse - forward - shock emission combination : a rebrightening light curve ( type i ) and a flattening light curve ( type ii ) @xcite .",
    "early afterglows in wind environments have been studied by chevalier , & li ( 2000 ) , wu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , kobayashi & zhang ( 2003b ) , panaitescu & kumar ( 2004b ) , and zou et al .",
    "generally , a flattening light curve in optical band is expected in the wind model @xcite , i.e. , there is only type ii light curve for the reverse - forward - shock emission combination . since the early optical afterglow of grb 050525a shows a rebrightening ( type i ) light curve , the reverse - forward shock model in a wind environment for the early afterglow of grb 050525a is not favored .",
    "the observed break at @xmath120 days in the optical afterglow light curve of grb 050525a @xcite may be due to an ultrarelativistic jet .",
    "this conclusion seems to be strengthened by lulin observatory around 17.7 hours after the burst ( at which the r - band magnitude is about @xmath121 , chiang et al .",
    "if so , the jet s half opening angle @xmath122 ( sari , piran , & halpern 1999 ) and thus the beaming - corrected gamma - ray energy @xmath123 ergs , which is by a factor of a few smaller than the mean energy release found by frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "even so , this energy still satisfies the relation of ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , @xmath126^{1.50\\pm 0.08}$ ] ( see dai , liang , & xu 2004 ) .    finally , what we want to point out is that besides the reverse - shock model discussed in this paper , the other plausible explanations of a rebrightening light curve include the density - jump medium ( dai & lu 2002 ; lazzati et al .",
    "2002 ) , pure poynting - flux injection ( dai & lu 1998 ) , baryon - dominated injection ( rees & mszros 1998 ; granot , nakar & piran 2003 ; nakar , piran & granot 2003 ; bjrnsson et al .",
    "2004 ) , two - component jet ( berger et al . 2003 ; huang et al . 2003 ) , neutron - fed fireball ( beloborodov 2003 ) , temporal fluctuation of @xmath43 and/or @xmath42 and departure of the electron distribution from a power law ( panaitescu & kumar 2004 ) .",
    "multiwavelength observations in the _ swift _ era are expected to distinguish among these possibilities .",
