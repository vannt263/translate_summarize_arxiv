    "a discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite and a great deal of work attempting to model this phenomenon allows to suppose that existence of a special class of scalar fields  phantom fields  is possible in the universe  @xcite .",
    "the phantom fields are some type of matter with the violated weak or null energy conditions .",
    "one of the ways of introduction of such fields is consideration of theories of a scalar field with a negative sign before a kinetic term ( ghost fields )  @xcite . in  @xcite , using the ghost fields , we have obtained regular wormhole , particle - like and brane - like solutions .",
    "another way consists in a consideration of braneworld models of dark energy which also allow violation of the weak or null energy conditions  @xcite .",
    "the accelerated expansion of the universe is being supported in phantom models by the phantom fields filling all the universe . in this paper",
    "we suppose that the phantom field really fills the universe , and we use this assumption for obtaining a thick - brane solution in a 5d spacetime with two interacting phantom scalar fields . previously , one of us has already obtained a similar regular solution for two usual interacting scalar fields  @xcite . here",
    "we want to compare the solutions from  @xcite with a solution to be found below , and to clarify the difference between thick - brane solutions with phantom and usual scalar fields .",
    "also we want to compare our results with the results from @xcite where thick branes with one usual scalar field are under consideration ( see also earlier work on thick branes  @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown there that corresponding solutions have ads asymptotics , the potential @xmath0 must be an alternating function , and also some fine tuning condition should be satisfied .",

    "this problem is being solved by the shooting method which is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the obtained results are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : fields_phantom]-[fig : energy_phantom ] . the solutions for the case @xmath4",
    "are shown by solid lines , and for the case @xmath3  by dashed lines .",
    "the following values of the masses were found : @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the case @xmath4 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath3 .",

    "one can see from that asymptotically @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an asymptotic value of the metric function , and subscripts ( -1 ) and ( + 1 ) refer to cases with phantom and usual fields , respectively .",
    "then , using these expressions and looking for a solution of equations - in the form @xmath26 we have the following asymptotic form for the scalar fields : @xmath27 } , \\\\      \\delta \\chi_{(-1)}&=&\\chi_\\infty \\exp{\\left[\\left(2k_{(-1)}-      \\sqrt{4k_{(-1)}^2 + 2m_1 ^ 2-\\lambda_2 m_2 ^ 2}\\right)r\\right ] } , \\\\      \\delta \\varphi_{(+1)}&=&\\varphi_\\infty \\exp{\\left[\\left(2k_{(+1)}-      \\sqrt{4k_{(+1)}^2 + 2 \\lambda_1m_1 ^ 2}\\right)r\\right ] } , \\\\      \\delta \\chi_{(+1)}&=&\\chi_\\infty \\exp{\\left[-\\left(2k_{(+1)}+      \\sqrt{4k_{(+1)}^2 + 2m_1 ^ 2-\\lambda_2 m_2 ^ 2}\\right)r\\right]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 are asymptotical values of the functions .",
    "one can see from the obtained expressions that asymptotically @xmath29 and @xmath30 , i.e. the solutions are finite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_phantom ] the profiles of the energy density @xmath31 \\label{energy - density}\\ ] ] for the phantom and usual scalar fields are shown .",
    "let us now study the dynamical stability of the above solutions against linear perturbations . to do this we have to write field equations following from the lagrangian keeping time dependence of metric and scalar fields functions .",
    "then @xmath32 and @xmath33 components of the einstein equations will be : @xmath34&= & \\epsilon\\left[\\frac{1}{2}a^2\\left(\\dot{\\varphi}^2+\\dot{\\chi}^2\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\varphi^{\\prime 2}+\\chi^{\\prime 2}\\right)+v\\right],\\\\ -3\\left[-\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a^3}+2\\left(\\frac{a^\\prime}{a}\\right)^2\\right]&= & \\epsilon\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}a^2\\left(\\dot{\\varphi}^2+\\dot{\\chi}^2\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\varphi^{\\prime 2}+\\chi^{\\prime 2}\\right)+v\\right],\\\\ 3\\left[-\\frac{\\dot{a}a^\\prime}{a^2}+\\frac{\\dot{a}^\\prime}{a}\\right]&= & \\epsilon\\left(-\\dot{\\varphi}\\varphi^\\prime-\\dot{\\chi}\\chi^\\prime\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where differentiation with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath9 is denoted by a @xmath36 and a @xmath37 correspondingly .    introducing a new metric function @xmath38 via @xmath39 the component @xmath33 takes the form @xmath40 the corresponding equations for the scalar fields are @xmath41-\\varphi^{\\prime\\prime}-4\\alpha^{\\prime}\\varphi^{\\prime}= -\\varphi\\left[2\\chi^2+\\lambda_1\\left(\\varphi^2-m_1 ^ 2\\right)\\right],\\\\ \\label{sfe_chi } e^{-2\\alpha}\\left[\\ddot{\\chi}+2\\dot{\\alpha}\\dot{\\varphi}\\right]-\\chi^{\\prime\\prime}-4\\alpha^{\\prime}\\chi^{\\prime}= -\\chi\\left[2\\varphi^2+\\lambda_2\\left(\\chi^2-m_2 ^ 2\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we perturb the solutions of the system - by expanding the metric function and scalar fields functions to first order as follows @xmath42 where the index @xmath43 indicates the static background solutions of equations - , and the index @xmath44 refers to perturbations .",

    "if there is a negative eigenvalue @xmath47 then the solution will be unstable since then @xmath48 will grow exponentially . in order to make clear this question , we will search for numerical solutions of equations , with boundary conditions @xmath49 for a case",
    "@xmath4 one can find that at @xmath50 the following regular solutions for @xmath51 exist ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : perturb_phant ] ) .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath52 ( dashed line ) from equations , with the boundary conditions and @xmath50.,width=453 ]    it indicates that the solutions with phantom scalar fields are stable for the case under consideration .",
    "but for a case @xmath53 we could not find any regular solutions of equations , .",
    "it seems that there is no stable solutions for usual scalar fields ( at least for the model s parameters we used here ) .",
    "in our opinion , the main distinction of the phantom thick brane from a brane created by usual scalar fields consists in asymptotical behavior of the metric function @xmath54 : for the phantom thick brane @xmath55 , and for the usual brane @xmath56 .",
    "we think that it happens due to the following reasons : let a solution has the following form near @xmath57 : @xmath58 their substitution in gives the following result @xmath59 it implies that at @xmath60 , @xmath61 and one has ( at least near @xmath57 ) a steadily increasing function which was confirmed by the numerical calculations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : metric_phantom ] . at @xmath62 , @xmath63 and one has a decreasing function .",
    "another interesting feature of the obtained solution is that the energy density of the phantom brane at the origin of coordinates @xmath57 has an absolute maximum . at the same time",
    ", the usual brane has a local minimum at @xmath57 .",
    "physically , it implies that in the phantom case the brane looks like a hill on the background of phantom matter with constant energy density . in case of usual brane a maximum of energy is concentrated near the brane on both sides . in our opinion",
    ", it may results in different scenarios of trapping of 4d matter on the phantom and usual branes .    at comparison of our solutions with the results from @xcite",
    "one might note the following differences : ( a ) the metric function @xmath54 increases exponentially ; ( b ) the potential @xmath64 does not change a sign ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] ) ; ( c )  in consequence of the condition ( b ) , there is no a fine tuning condition .      in ref .",
    "@xcite such fine tuning condition is necessary for obtaining of a thick brane supported by one scalar field .",
    "this fine tuning condition consists in the following : using the metric @xmath65 with the harmonic coordinate @xmath66 , such that @xmath67 , one should has the following fine tuning condition @xmath68 where @xmath69 in our case the corresponding condition could be obtained as follows : from equations , one has @xmath70 and because of @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 this indicates that the nontrivial potential @xmath73 does not change a sign as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] .",
    "so we have obtained the solutions describing a thick phantom brane in 5d bulk .",
    "there are two main distinctive features of these solutions : a ) they have different asymptotic behavior ; b ) the solutions with phantom scalar fields are stable , and the solutions with usual scalar fields are not ( at least for the parameters @xmath74 we used here ) .",
