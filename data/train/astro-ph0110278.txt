    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are the sites of most star formation in the milky way , and the evolution of the galaxy and its stellar population are controlled in large part by the physics of gmcs . despite several decades of observations , the clouds physical nature , longevity , and modes of formation and destruction are still matters of debate .",
    "if clouds survive for more than a single dynamical time , it is plausible that their observed properties are ( like stars ) the product of internal sources and sinks of energy ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "if instead they disappear after one crossing time @xcite then their properties will be more affected by the mechanism of their formation @xcite .",
    "however , rapid destruction also implies that the means of cloud destruction may play an equally important role .",
    "this paper considers what consequences the mechanisms of cloud destruction  primarily hii regions ",
    "imply for the internal motions , energy budgets , star formation rates , and lifetimes of gmcs .",
    "molecular clouds are observed to obey a set of scaling relations known collectively as larson s ( @xcite ) laws . as updated by @xcite ,",
    "these can be summarized : a constant mean column density @xmath1 , corresponding to a visual extinction @xmath2 mag ; and virial balance , with a virial parameter @xmath3 @xcite of order unity @xcite . @xcite",
    "adopt the value @xmath4 , yielding the relation @xmath5 between the r.m.s . and escape velocities . ) , whose observations may be affected by beam smearing and velocity crowding ( j.  p. williams 2001 , private communication ) , this assumption should be checked by future observations . ]",
    "a third but not independent property is the scaling of line width ( @xmath6 ) with cloud radius ( @xmath7 pc ) : @xmath8 km / s . as they do not represent infall , these motions are considered turbulence .",
    "the molecular gas is cold ( @xmath9 k ) and highly magnetized ( @xmath10 ) , so its motions are supersonic but roughly alfvnic .    @xcite advance a model in which these properties derive from motions within the interstellar medium ( ism ) from which gmcs form . in two - dimensional simulations of turbulence within the galactic disk ,",
    "they identify a population of overdensities that could be considered clouds . because of the turbulent spectrum , all of the objects formed in their simulations obey the line width - size relation noted above .",
    "however , all but the few most massive of these are transient compressions rather than self - gravitating objects ; hence their escape velocities and surface densities do not follow the virial relation .",
    "@xcite suggest that selection effects restrict observed clouds to a narrow range of inferred column densities . specifically",
    ", they note that the iras survey of @xcite may only be sensitive to an outer shell of warm dust around clouds of various columns .",
    "however , @xcite has countered that co would form and be detectable at significantly smaller columns ( @xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than are typical of the observed gmcs .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the common gmc column density arises from internal cloud processes : specifically energetic feedback due to star formation ( as in the model of * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m89 ) .",
    "for this to be possible , two conditions must hold : 1 .",
    "stars form rapidly only in regions that exceed a critical column density ; and 2 .",
    "star formation is potentially so vigorous a source of turbulent energy that it overwhelms the natural decay of turbulence if the column is much above this critical value . under these conditions",
    "a gmc will settle into a state of energetic equilibrium much like a star s , with star formation occurring just fast enough to offset turbulent decay .",
    "the necessary column density would be roughly the critical value , hence the common value observed among gmcs .    for condition",
    "( 1 ) , @xcite proposed that star formation is inhibited in regions that are not shielded by @xmath12 visual magnitudes in each direction , because these layers are penetrated by far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons that elevate the level of ionization .",
    "fuv ionization thus slows ambipolar diffusion , which m89 argued to be a rate - limiting step for star formation because stellar mass regions are too highly magnetized to collapse directly .",
    "this sets the critical column density at roughly 8 visual magnitudes ( 4 on each side ) , close to the value of 7.5 observed in gmcs .",
    "corroborating this hypothesis , @xcite find a sharp distinction among substructures in the taurus clouds between those with @xmath13 mag that are actively forming stars , and those with lower extinctions that are not . in the low - metallicity environment of the smc",
    ", @xcite verified that the clouds maintain @xmath14 mag , although this required a higher column density than for milky way clouds .    for condition ( 2 ) , @xcite specified protostellar winds as the agents of star formation feedback , following @xcite and @xcite , who implicated main - sequence winds , and @xcite , who realized the potential of their protostellar counterparts .",
    "subsequent numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have indicated a much faster decay of turbulence than @xcite assumed , calling into question ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the notion that energy injection from protostellar winds is vigorous enough to offset turbulent decay .",
    "below , we show that hii regions ( originally considered by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) represent an additional , inevitable , and more important source of turbulent energy for molecular clouds .",
    "the rapid decay of turbulent energy should logically cause an equally rapid contraction of gmcs , the end product of which is star formation .",
    "nevertheless , clouds make stars at a tiny fraction of the rate allowed by direct gravitational collapse .",
    "star formation is not only slow , but inefficient : the protostellar sources observed by @xcite compose @xmath15 of their surrounding clouds ; @xcite surveyed 54 clouds , estimating @xmath16 of their mass to be in stars , on the basis of their hii regions ; and @xcite ( hereafter , wm97 ) argued that only @xmath17 of the mass of a gmc would ever become stellar .",
    "more recently , @xcite has estimated that @xmath18 of the mass of several nearby molecular clouds is in embedded stars .",
    "the sluggishness and inefficiency of star formation can only be consistent with the rapid decay of turbulent energy if gmcs are destroyed more rapidly than they can convert themselves into stars .",
    "what process destroys molecular clouds ?",
    "@xcite note that gravitationally unbound clouds formed by turbulent compressions are easily disrupted in a single crossing time by the flows that created them .",
    "however they also show that bound objects , once formed , continue to collapse rather than re - expanding .",
    "( in these authors simulations , such clouds are stabilized or disrupted by a local heating included to represent the action of massive star formation , a topic to be addressed in detail below . )",
    "the @xcite  survey indicates that molecular clouds are far too tightly bound to be destroyed by turbulence in the interstellar medium : their hydrostatic pressures are in excess of @xmath19 , whereas the bounding gas pressure is only @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the ram pressure of motions in the diffuse ism ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) is also @xmath23 , and thus insufficient to disrupt a cloud .",
    "clouds contain a binding energy per volume that is roughly three halves their hydrostatic pressure ( somewhat less , due to magnetization ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this was radiated in the process of formation and must be resupplied to unbind the cloud .",
    "the most plausible source for this energy is young and massive stars formed within the cloud itself .",
    "several mechanisms have been considered in this regard . @xcite",
    "have shown that small clouds can be disrupted by protostellar outflows as they form low - mass stars ; however , they predict such mass loss not to be important for giant clouds .",
    "@xcite suggested that radiation pressure might unbind clouds if their stellar populations became too luminous , but neglected the reprocessing of radiation into far - infrared wavelengths to which clouds are transparent ( see * ? ? ?",
    "molecules are destroyed by fuv photons in photodissociation regions ; however , the thermal velocities of these regions are far below the escape velocities of gmcs .",
    "therefore , photodissociation regions are thought to form an atomic layer around gmcs @xcite and have only been suggested as a means of destruction for clouds that are dynamically disrupted by a different process @xcite , as @xcite may have observed around the cold cloud g216 - 2.5 .",
    "@xcite calculated the destructive effects of massive stars due to the ejection of photoionized gas , finding @xmath24 to be ejected for each blister - type hii region .",
    "supernova explosions typically add @xmath15 and at most @xmath25 to this amount , for hii regions created by single stars .",
    "a few supernovae arise from b stars in the mass range @xmath26 , which do not have appreciable hii regions @xcite ; however , these require at least @xmath27 years to evolve , and eject only @xmath28 each if they explode inside their cloud ( and much less otherwise ; ) . the main - sequence winds of massive stars emit a total energy comparable to supernovae . @xcite and @xcite have argued that stellar wind bubbles are confined within hii regions in the context of a cloudy medium .",
    "for these reasons , we concentrate on photoionization as the primary cause of destruction for gmcs ( as have @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite , and wm97 )",
    ". the dynamical effects of stellar winds and supernovae are considered in  [ winds&sne ] .",
    "the fact that massive stars are responsible for unbinding molecular clouds more rapidly than they can form stars implies that they supply more energy than is dissipated in turbulence .",
    "if a fraction of this energy is incorporated into the motions of the remaining molecular gas , it will sustain turbulence and slow the cloud s contraction . in the following sections we consider the loss and regeneration of turbulent motions (  [ sourcesandsinks ] ) , the relative importance of hii regions and protostellar winds (  [ dominance ] ) , the dynamics of an individual association (  [ obmomentum ] ) and of a population of associations (  [ pperstar ] ) , and the implications of an equilibrium between the decay of turbulence and its regeneration in hii regions for the ionizing luminosities and star formation rates (  [ sfr ] ) and lifetimes (  [ lifetimes ] ) of massive clouds .",
    "these estimates are corrected for the interaction between hii regions in  [ porosity ] .",
    "finally , in  [ conclusions ] we point out that the high - pressure environments of starburst galaxies prevent molecular clouds from being destroyed or even supported by photoionization . in the absence of other sources of energy ,",
    "such clouds must collapse and form stars at a high efficiency ; this is a recipe for the efficient formation of massive star clusters often observed in starbursts .",
    "to consider the fates of gmcs , one must account for the gains and losses of turbulent energy @xcite . m89",
    "assumed a range of timescales for the dissipation of turbulent energy , @xmath29 ranging from three to ten times the free - fall time of the cloud . here , @xmath30 represents both kinetic and magnetic energy associated with turbulent motions @xcite .",
    "simulations by @xcite show incomplete equipartition between these components : for the case that most resembles molecular clouds ( magnetic pressure 100 times greater than gas pressure ) , @xmath31 @xcite s assumption of a relatively long decay time scale was based on the notion that the magnetic field should cushion gas motions . testing this notion numerically ,",
    "several groups @xcite have found the dissipation to be much more rapid , especially if turbulence is driven on scales smaller than the entire cloud .",
    "for the same physical situation that gives equation ( [ equipart ] ) , @xcite find @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the wavelength on which the turbulence is stirred .",
    "combining this with @xcite s virial relation @xmath34 gives @xmath35 .",
    "this dissipation time scale is shorter than the range assumed by m89 if the forcing scale for turbulence is smaller than the radius of the cloud ; the importance of the forcing scale has recently been highlighted by @xcite .    to estimate how turbulence is driven",
    "one must allow for the radiative nature of the gas , which causes compressions to be very dissipative .",
    "our argument follows @xcite and m89 . an impulse ( such as a protostellar wind ) whose momentum is @xmath36 will cause a disturbance that decelerates as it sweeps into the cloud .",
    "since energy is radiated , a thin shell forms and conserves linear momentum in each direction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the kinetic energy associated with the motion is @xmath37 when the velocity is @xmath38 .",
    "this continues until @xmath38 has decelerated to a terminal velocity that wm97 estimate to be the effective sound speed , @xmath39 .",
    "( note that @xmath40 far exceeds the thermal sound speed , as @xmath41 includes the total hydrostatic pressure . ) at this point the swept - up shell thickens , stalls , and loses coherence , rendering its energy to the turbulence .",
    "the increase of turbulent energy is therefore @xmath42 the efficiency coefficient @xmath43 is uncertain , and must be determined by simulation ; @xcite suggests @xmath44 to account for the energy stored in magnetic perturbations at the end of deceleration .",
    "equation ( [ regen ] ) implies that protostellar winds and hii regions generate turbulent energy in proportion to the rate at which they impart momentum to the cloud .    equation ( [ regen ] )",
    "is essentially the same formula employed previously by @xcite , m89 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it assumes that energy is injected in an explosive manner , so that the early stage of momentum - conserving thin shell expansion ( at speeds above @xmath40 ) can be separated from the later stage of turbulent dissipation ( at speeds of about @xmath45 ) .",
    "it is only valid in cases where the kinetic energy of relative gas motions is present in the center - of - mass frame of the cloud ; therefore , it does not apply to large - scale gravitational fields . for the same reason its validity is suspect if the force that gives rise to @xmath36 is applied over a large length scale compared to the cloud radius .",
    "however , we shall see in the subsequent sections that hii regions are explosive events that input momentum on scales smaller than @xmath46 , at least for clouds in our mass range of interest .",
    "what are appropriate values of @xmath36 ? in the formation of a low - mass star , a fraction of the material that accretes onto the star - disk system is redirected into winds with a characteristic velocity @xmath47 km / s .",
    "an observational analysis by @xcite implies a characteristic wind momentum of roughly @xmath48 times the mass of the star that forms ; however , this analysis is quite uncertain .",
    "models exist in which the wind removes anywhere from a tenth to half the mass flowing through the disk @xcite .",
    "we adopt one - sixth as an intermediate value ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that the wind mass is five times smaller than the star s mass . with this choice",
    ", each star of mass @xmath49 generates a wind impulse @xmath50 where @xmath51 represents our uncertainty . in ",
    "[ winds&sne ] we find that main - sequence and evolved stars contribute a comparable momentum in the six million years after their formation ; here , we restrict our attention to the more impulsive protostellar winds .",
    "if @xmath52 is the total rate at which mass is converted into stars in a cloud , equation ( [ regen ] ) gives @xmath53 as the rate of turbulence regeneration by protostellar winds .",
    "next , consider cloud destruction at a rate @xmath54 in a sequence of discrete events ( ejecting @xmath55 per event ) , no one of which completely destroys the cloud .",
    "each mass ejection delivers an equal and opposite impulse to the cloud material left behind , and each impulse increases cloud turbulence according to equation ( [ regen ] ) .",
    "since the ejection velocity must exceed @xmath56 near the surface of the cloud , @xmath57 if photoionization is the primary means of destruction , then material is ejected at about the thermal velocity of ionized gas , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 where @xmath60 is defined in analogy to @xmath51 ; by equation ( [ regen ] ) , @xmath61 an analysis of the generation of momentum in ionization fronts , presented in section [ ifmomentum ] , shows that @xmath62 .      a comparison between equations ( [ pdotstar ] ) and ( [ edotionization ] ) reveals the importance of massive star formation in the support of gmcs .",
    "relevant to this comparison is the net efficiency of star formation , @xmath63 , defined as the fraction of cloud mass that will ever become stars : @xmath64 the denominator equals the initial mass of the cloud ( in the absence of ongoing accretion from the ism ) .",
    "thus @xmath65 where the brackets are time averages .",
    "@xmath63 is estimated observationally by the _",
    "current _ fraction of mass in stars ; the two are comparable if the efficiency is low , if stars remain within their clouds @xcite .",
    "if we take @xmath66 as typical , then @xmath67 of the cloud s mass will be disrupted by blister hii regions rather than achieving stardom .",
    "equations ( [ pw ] ) , ( [ pdotionization ] ) , and ( [ sfe2 ] ) imply that the momentum contributed by protostellar winds is smaller than the contribution by hii regions so long as @xmath68 clouds that make stars as inefficiently as galactic gmcs derive more turbulent energy from blister hii regions _ alone _ than from protostellar winds . in  [ pperstar ] we shall show that hii regions would be more important than protostellar winds even if star formation were efficient .",
    "the dynamical phases of expansion of an hii region have been presented in numerous prior works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these authors neglected the inertia of the shell of shocked cloud gas ; we give only a cursory treatment including this inertia , for the purpose of quantifying the momentum generated .",
    "we follow @xcite ( hereafter , mw97 ) in adopting a common temperature of 7000 k for ionized gas ( and mean molecular weight 0.61 , so @xmath69 km / s ) and in approximating that @xmath70 of the ionizing photons ( emitted at a rate @xmath71 per second ) are absorbed by dust rather than gas .",
    "we will also take for the molecular gas a uniform density @xmath72 and hydrogen number density @xmath73 consistent with a mean hydrogen column density @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "after a rapid expansion to the initial strmgen radius ( using the recombination coefficient of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath75 the hii region is governed by the requirement that a very small fraction of the ionizing photons actually reach the ionization front .",
    "this causes ionized gas density @xmath76 to vary as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the current radius of the ionization front .",
    "as the ionization front expands subsonically the density @xmath79 and pressure @xmath80 are nearly uniform within the hii region ( albeit more perfectly for embedded than for blister regions , in which a pressure gradient develops as gas accelerates away ) .",
    "so long as the hii region expands supersonically with respect to the molecular gas , it is bounded by a thin shell of dense , shocked cloud gas .",
    "the radius of this shell is nearly identical to @xmath81 , and we shall restrict our attention to the period of expansion @xmath82 , when nearly all of the mass originally within @xmath81 remains within the shell @xcite .",
    "let @xmath83 denote the shell s area and @xmath84 its mass .",
    "the shell s momentum equation is @xmath85.\\ ] ] on the left of this equation is @xmath86 , the rate of increase of the shell s momentum ; on the right , the forces due to pressure ( first term in brackets ) and due to thrust caused by the exhaust of ionized gas at a velocity @xmath87 relative to the cloud .",
    "blister and embedded hii regions differ in the coefficient relating @xmath88 to @xmath81 : @xmath89 for ( blister , embedded ) hii regions whose ionization fronts are idealized as hemispheres and spheres , respectively .",
    "another difference is the relative importance of thrust and pressure in generating momentum . in an embedded region ,",
    "the ionized gas is trapped and only expands homologously ; equation ( [ rhoii ] ) then implies @xmath90 , which is much less than @xmath91 when @xmath92 @xcite so that only pressure need be considered . in blister regions , on the other hand , ionized gas flows away freely allowing the ionization front to tend toward the d - critical state @xcite for which @xmath93 if the ionized gas is effectively isothermal : recoil is just as important as pressure in generating momentum .",
    "the term in brackets on the right hand side of ( [ shellmom ] ) is therefore , to a good approximation , @xmath94 for ( blister , embedded ) regions respectively , assuming a d - critical ionization front for the former .",
    "the rate at which mass is ionized is @xmath95 , or approximately @xmath96 for a blister region when @xmath97 .",
    "the ratio between the rate of momentum generation and the rate of ionization is @xmath98 , so equation ( [ shellmom ] ) implies @xmath99 where equality holds for @xmath100 , i.e. , a d - critical front .",
    "the expansion of the hii region is simplest to determine when @xmath92 . in this phase , @xmath101 assuming radial expansion .",
    "we seek a self - similar expansion of the form @xmath102 ; equation ( [ shellmom ] ) admits the solution @xmath103^{2/7 } r_{\\rm st , 0}^{3/7 } ( { c_{\\rm ii } } t)^{4/7 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & ( 23,19 ) \\times \\left(\\frac{t}{3.7~{{\\rm myr}}}\\right)^{4/7 } \\left(\\frac{n_{h,22}}{1.5}\\right)^{-3/7 } \\nonumber \\\\ & ~ & \\times   { m_{\\rm cl,6}}^{1/7 } s_{49}^{1/7 } ~{{\\rm pc}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for ( blister , embedded ) regions , respectively . in this equation",
    "the first line indicates @xmath104 , which fixes the coefficient in the second line .",
    "we have normalized to the ionization - averaged lifetime of rich ob associations ( m97 ) of 3.7 myr .",
    "the momentum of radial motion of the expanding shell is @xmath105 for ( blister , embedded ) regions .",
    "note that the extra thrust generated at the ionization front in a blister region compensates for the smaller working surface @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , the two results are so similar that we may estimate @xmath36 using the intermediate coefficient @xmath106 , without discriminating between the two types of regions .",
    "this will simplify the analysis in  [ pperstar ] .    for a blister region ,",
    "the mass evaporated is @xmath107 : for @xmath108 , @xmath109 the axisymmetric calculations of give a result that is only @xmath110 lower , once we account for the differences between their ionized sound speed and recombination coefficient and ours ( without these corrections , their result would be @xmath111 higher ) .",
    "this favorable comparison gives us confidence in the approximations adopted in this section .",
    "note that the above results differ quantitatively from those given by @xcite , which were adopted by wm97 to study the erosion of molecular clouds ( see  [ ifmomentum ] ) .",
    "our equation ( [ meveval ] ) for the mass evaporated agrees with these authors results within @xmath112 .",
    "however , equation ( [ riieval ] ) gives a radius for a blister or an embedded region that is smaller by a factor of 1.6 or 1.9 , respectively , than the characteristic size quoted by these authors for blister regions  implying this characteristic size is best interpreted as the diameter of the hii region ( note that @xmath113 ) .",
    "the above equations must be restricted to hii regions that are still expanding and bounded within their gmc at the end of their ionizing lifetimes .",
    "if its luminosity is too low , the region will decelerate to @xmath40 and stall before its driving stars burn out ; as wm97 argue , such associations are too small to matter ( but see  [ conclusions ] ) .",
    "if its luminosity is too high , the hii region will envelop its entire cloud ( @xmath114 , deforming the gmc into a cometary configuration @xcite rocketing away from the association @xcite .",
    "since this reduces the rate of photoevaporation considerably , wm97 argued that an appropriate maximum value for @xmath55 should be roughly the value predicted for a blister region at twice the time required for its size to match the cloud radius .",
    "using @xcite s theory for the size scale , wm97 identified a maximum value @xmath115 because the blister hii region radius derived in equation ( [ riieval ] ) is smaller by a factor 1.6 than in @xcite s theory , this upper limit corresponds to evaluating equation ( [ meveval ] ) at a time when @xmath116 . since this upper limit is quite uncertain , and",
    "since there is an ambiguity between the radius and diameter of the hii region in wm97 s argument , we shall simply adopt their value as given in equation ( [ mevmax ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , we shall take an upper limit for the effective injection of momentum to be @xmath117 note that these upper limits on @xmath55 and @xmath36 are important for hii regions if @xmath118    a more serious limitation on the theory presented here arises from the fact that we have ignored gravity in the evolution of an hii region .",
    "if the gmc is too dense ( @xmath119 ) , its free - fall time will be shorter than the typical ionizing lifetime of 3.7 myr .",
    "this is typically true of clouds unless @xmath120 for clouds below this limit , the orbital motion of an association within or about the cloud is likely to alter its hii region , possibly by converting it into a cometary hii region of the type discussed by , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "lastly , we have not attempted to account for the inhomogeneities of molecular cloud material in the evolution of an hii region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nor to instabilities that may develop during its expansion @xcite .",
    "the finite porosity of the gmc ( i.e. , the interaction between hii regions ; see wm97 ) will be accounted for in an approximate manner in  [ porosity ] .      we now consider the effects of stellar winds and supernovae on the evolution of an hii region .",
    "results in this section are based on the stellar evolution code starburst99 @xcite , for which we have used a scalo stellar initial mass function normalized as in mw97 . in the first 3.7 million years after stars form , they inject roughly @xmath121 of momentum : @xmath122 from protostellar winds , @xmath123 from main - sequence and evolved stars , and @xmath124 in supernova ejecta . in the formation of a sufficiently massive stellar cluster ,",
    "protostellar winds are mostly stopped within the self - gravitating clump from which the cluster arose @xcite and will affect this clump s dynamics @xcite more than those of the surrounding cloud .",
    "the remaining contribution is @xmath125 if , in the first 3.7 myr , this is smaller than the momentum imparted by the hii region , the ram pressure from stellar winds is lower than @xmath80 .",
    "this means that the winds will be confined within the hii region , while the ionizing stars shine , unless @xmath126 for ( blister , embedded ) hii regions , respectively .",
    "sufficiently luminous associations couple primarily through stellar ejecta rather than through their hii regions ; this is significant for the massive clusters forming in starburst environments @xcite and for the most luminous of milky way clusters",
    ".    equation ( [ windrelevance ] ) accounts only for the momentum in material flung away from a star .",
    "more radial momentum can potentially be generated in a pressurized bubble or blastwave that entrains ambient mass , as the radial momentum varies with energy @xmath127 and total mass @xmath128 as @xmath129 .",
    "whereas in a thin shell @xmath36 is conserved while @xmath127 is not , in a fully adiabatic bubble or blastwave @xmath127 is conserved while @xmath36 increases as @xmath128 does .",
    "intermediate cases , such as pressure - driven snowplows @xcite and partially radiative bubbles @xcite , involve a loss of energy but a gain of radial momentum .",
    "@xcite have argued that , in the context of an inhomogeneous medium , stellar wind bubbles are either confined within their hii regions or made radiative by mass input from photoevaporating clumps . in a blister hii region , furthermore , hot gas can escape from the cloud . for these reasons we shall assume that stellar wind bubbles do not generate momentum significantly in excess of the wind momentum itself .",
    "supernovae merit special attention , as supernova remnants typically experience an adiabatic sedov - taylor phase ( @xmath130 ) followed by a pressure - driven snowplow phase ( @xmath131 ) . for",
    "an upper imf cutoff of @xmath132 , the first supernovae explode 3.6 myr after the onset of star formation and thereafter occur every @xmath133 myr for the first million years , slowing to once per @xmath134 myr thereafter .",
    "this frequency should be compared with the sound - crossing time of the hii region , @xmath135 myr , and with the @xmath136-folding decay time of the ionizing luminosity , roughly 2.5 myr . in a rich association",
    "the delay between supernovae is the shortest of these , implying that supernovae blend together with the stellar winds .",
    "the above arguments indicate that the combined effects of supernovae and winds are negligible unless equation ( [ windrelevance ] ) is satisfied .    as a check",
    ", we have calculated the dynamics of the very first supernova remnant inside the hii region , using the theory of @xcite .",
    "because the progenitor mass is very high ( @xmath137 in the presupernova state ) , the remnant becomes radiative before a comparable mass has been swept up , skipping the sedov - taylor phase ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the high progenitor mass also allows for a transition to a momentum - conserving snowplow phase while the remnant is still expanding supersonically .",
    "the remnant becomes subsonic and merges with the hii region before striking its periphery if @xmath138 for ( blister , embedded ) regions .",
    "if this happens , the remnant adds little or no momentum to the hii region .",
    "this corroborates the above conclusion that supernovae are not significant for the momentum of the hii region , except for regions smaller than the limit in equation ( [ snmerge ] ) or larger than the limit in equation ( [ windrelevance ] ) .",
    "the possibility remains that supernovae in small associations contribute non - negligibly to the total momentum input and hence reduce the ionizing flux and star formation rate we derive below by neglecting supernovae ; this merits further study .",
    "if a cluster were to deliver an impulse in excess of @xmath139 to its parent cloud in a time short compared to the cloud s dynamical time , the cloud would be dynamically unbound .",

    "this result was indicated by the low efficiency of star formation in gmcs in  [ dominance ] and demonstrated on more general grounds in   [ winds&sne ] and [ populationmomentum ] .",
    "2 .   the input of turbulent energy by hii regions occurs on scales comparable to , but somewhat smaller than , the cloud radius .",
    "large - scale forcing minimizes the rate of turbulent decay , as recently emphasized by @xcite .",
    "3 .   a balance between turbulent decay and the regeneration of turbulence by hii regions allows a prediction of the stellar ionizing luminosity and ( less robustly ) the star formation rate .",
    "we present these results for clouds in the mass range @xmath306 , in which the stellar ionizing lifetime is briefer than the free - fall time .",
    "the results are roughly consistent with the total ionizing luminosity and star formation rate of the inner galaxy , provided that future numerical simulations verify our estimate of the coupling between momentum input and turbulent energy ( eq . [ [ suggestnumerics ] ] ) .",
    "our estimate of the ionizing flux in the inner galaxy is @xmath234 higher than the observed value ; we list in  [ porosity ] several possible resolutions of this discrepancy .",
    "because hii regions also evaporate their clouds , an energetic balance also implies a rate of photoevaporation and a destruction time scale for gmcs .",
    "we derive a destruction time of 17 to 24 times @xmath316 million years , somewhat shorter than was found by wm97 .",
    "the upper mass limit for milky way gmcs most likely derives from the difficulty of assembling an object that destroys itself in a single crossing time",
    ". however , less massive clouds ( at least down to @xmath317 ) survive for many crossing times , produce many hii regions per crossing time , and are in both energetic and dynamical equilibrium .",
    "so long as there exists a minimum optical depth or column density required for star formation , the vigorous energetic feedback by hii regions provides a mechanism for the maintenance of cloud column densities near the critical value , and hence , for the gmc line width - size relation .",
    "massive clouds therefore follow the scenario proposed by m89 , but with hii regions rather than protostellar winds as the primary agents of feedback .",
    "this conclusion is not assured for clouds less massive than @xmath317 , for which cloud gravity must be considered in the dynamics of hii regions .",
    "the theory we have presented is robust , in the sense that it applies to massive gmcs ( containing the bulk of the molecular mass ) and derives from the flattening of the luminosity function between rich and poor ob associations  a product solely of the upper mass limit for stars  rather than the detailed birthrate distribution of ob associations .",
    "so long as a galaxy s molecular mass is concentrated in the most massive clouds , and so long as the birthrate of stellar associations drops with ionizing luminosity more steeply than @xmath318 , energetic equilibrium within molecular clouds determines its ionizing flux .",
    "this assertion can be tested by extragalactic observations .",
    "starbursts may however be an exception to this rule if , as discussed below , their gmcs are not in equilibrium .",
    "other observational tests of the theory presented here include the variation of ionizing luminosity and star formation rate ( figure [ fig2 ] ) with cloud mass and the high porosity of hii regions ( figure [ fig4 ] ) for massive gmcs .",
    "the variations of these quantities with mean cloud column density can potentially be tested by observations of the smc .",
    "the star formation efficiency ( figure [ fig1 ] ) and cloud lifetime ( figure [ fig3 ] ) will be more difficult to verify .",
    "the inhomogeneity of giant molecular clouds is the greatest source of uncertainty in the present work .",
    "the interaction of hii regions  one source of inhomogeneity  was treated in an approximate manner in  [ porosity ] , but future work must treat the interaction of hii regions with a realistic background cloud .",
    "we have noted that clouds more massive than @xmath319 should not form in the milky way because they would be disrupted by hii regions in the time needed to assemble them .",
    "however , we must also note that clouds more massive than about @xmath320 may be incapable of driving champagne flows because their escape velocities exceed the exhaust velocity @xmath321 of ionized gas .",
    "this fact does not affect our derivation of the star formation rate in such clouds , but it does call into question our derivation of the lifetime for the most massive clouds ( and hence our suggestion for the origin of the upper mass limit ) . further work will be needed to resolve this issue .",
    "similarly , clouds more massive than about @xmath322 can not have supersonic hii regions , as their effective sound speeds exceed @xmath323 , the sound speed of ionized gas .",
    "objects created in this state or pushed into it by an increase in external pressure can neither be disrupted nor even supported by photoionization , and must collapse as rapidly as their turbulence decays ; this is a recipe for the efficient production of massive star clusters observed to occur in starburst galaxies .",
    "for instance , @xcite find values of @xmath324 in the range @xmath325 to @xmath326 for the _ mean _ central molecular gas in a number of starbursts ; this is sufficient to crush all gmcs in the mass range @xmath327 .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank chris mckee , jonathan williams , and the referee , mordecai - mark mac low , for substantial comments that led to improvements of this paper .",
    "i am also grateful to peter goldreich , rob kennicutt , peter martin , eve ostriker , nick scoville , and jim stone for insightful discussions and suggestions .",
    "this research was supported by an nserc fellowship ."
