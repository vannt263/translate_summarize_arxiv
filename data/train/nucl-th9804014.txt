    "large - basis no - core shell - model calculations have recently been performed @xcite . in these calculations",
    "all nucleons are active , which simplifies the effective interaction as no hole states are present . in the approach taken , the effective interaction derived microscopically from modern nucleon - nucleon potentials is determined for a system of two nucleons only and subsequently used in the many - particle calculations . to take into account a part of the many - body effects a , so - called , multi - valued effective interaction approach was introduced and applied in the no - core shell - model calculations @xcite .    in the past , these calculations concentrated on the @xmath5-shell nuclei and @xmath6 @xmath7-shell nuclei .",
    "in addition , @xmath8li was studied in a @xmath4 model - space calculation @xcite and the obtained wave - functions were employed for evaluating proton and electron scattering characteristics @xcite .",
    "large - basis no - core shell - model calculations for heavier @xmath7-shell nuclei have not been discussed until recently . in the most recent application , we applied the no - core shell - model approach to the @xmath9 nuclei in order to evaluate the isospin - mixing correction to the fermi matrix element @xmath10c@xmath11b @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we complement this study by presenting the results for other light @xmath7-shell nuclides .",
    "in particular , we present calculations for the @xmath2 nuclei @xmath12he , @xmath12li , @xmath12be and @xmath12b performed in a @xmath3 model space , in which configurations up to an energy of @xmath3 relative to the unperturbed ground - state configuration are included .",
    "for @xmath13 , results were obtained for @xmath14he , @xmath14li , @xmath14be and @xmath14b in a @xmath4 model space . for @xmath15 we calculated properties of @xmath16he , @xmath16li , @xmath16be , @xmath16b and @xmath16c also in a @xmath4 model space . as the @xmath9 nuclides @xmath10c , @xmath10b , and partly @xmath10be ,",
    "were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we now complete the @xmath9 nuclei description by including results for @xmath10he , @xmath10li and @xmath10be . finally , we give the results of a @xmath4 calculation for @xmath17li and @xmath17be .",
    "our study is distinguished from other @xmath7-shell - nuclei calculations by the fact that we are using microscopically derived effective interactions , contrary to phenomenological interactions employed in most other papers @xcite .",
    "the other distinguishing factor is the use of large multi - configuration model spaces .",
    "the organization for the paper is as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec2 ] we discuss the shell - model hamiltonian with a bound center - of - mass and the method used to derive the starting - energy - independent effective interaction .",
    "results of the calculations for @xmath0 are presented in section [ sec3 ] and concluding remarks are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "in the present paper we apply the approach discussed in refs . @xcite .",
    "we start with the one- plus two - body hamiltonian for the a - nucleon system , i.e. , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the nucleon mass , @xmath20 the nucleon - nucleon interaction and @xmath21 @xmath22 is the the center - of - mass harmonic - oscillator potential .",
    "the latter potential does not influence intrinsic properties of the many - body system .",
    "it provides , however , a mean field felt by each nucleon and allows us to work with a convenient harmonic - oscillator basis .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , depending on the harmonic - oscillator frequency @xmath23 , may be cast into the form @xmath24 + \\sum_{i < j}^a \\left [ v_{\\rm n}(\\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j ) -\\frac{m\\omega^2}{2a } ( \\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j)^2 \\right ] \\ ; .\\ ] ] the one - body term of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega ] ) is then re - written as a sum of the center - of - mass term @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and a term depending only on relative coordinates .",
    "shell - model calculations are carried out in a model space defined by a projector @xmath27 . in the present work",
    ", we will always use a complete @xmath28 model space which includes all the configurations up to an energy of @xmath28 relative to the unperturbed ground - state configuration .",
    "the complementary space to the model space is defined by the projector @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , from among the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega ] ) , it is necessary to choose only those corresponding to the same center - of - mass energy .",
    "this can be achieved by projecting the center - of - mass eigenstates with energies greater than @xmath30 upwards in the energy spectrum .",
    "the shell - model hamiltonian , used in the actual calculations , takes the form @xmath31p + \\sum_{i < j}^a p\\left [ v_{ij}-\\frac{m\\omega^2}{2a } ( \\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j)^2 \\right]_{\\rm eff } p   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\beta p(h^\\omega_{\\rm cm}-\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega)p\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a sufficiently large positive parameter . in eq .",
    "( [ phamomegabeta ] ) , the notation @xmath33_{\\rm eff}$ ] means that the quantity within the square brackets is the residual interaction to be used in the determination of the effective interaction within the model space @xmath27 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .    the effective interaction introduced in eq .",
    "( [ phamomegabeta ] ) should , in principle , exactly reproduce the full - space results in the model space for some subset of states . in practice",
    ", the effective interactions can never be calculated exactly , because , in general , for an @xmath34-nucleon system an @xmath34-body effective interaction is required .",
    "consequently , large model spaces are desirable when only an approximate effective interaction is used . in that case , the calculation should be less affected by any imprecision of the effective interaction .",
    "the same is true for the evaluation of any observable characterized by an operator . in the model space ,",
    "renormalized effective operators are also required .",
    "the larger the model space , the less renormalization is needed .",
    "usually , the effective interaction is approximated by a two - body effective interaction determined from a two - nucleon system . in this study",
    ", we use the procedure , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . to construct the effective interaction",
    "we employ the lee - suzuki @xcite similarity transformation method , which gives an interaction in the form @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the transformation operator satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "the projection operators @xmath38 project on the two - nucleon model and complementary spaces , respectively . note that we distinguish the two - nucleon system projection operators @xmath39 from the a - nucleon system operators @xmath40 .",
    "our calculations start with exact solutions of the hamiltonian @xmath41 which is the shell - model hamiltonian ( [ hamomega ] ) applied to a two - nucleon system .",
    "we construct the effective interaction directly from these solutions .",
    "let us denote the two - nucleon harmonic - oscillator states , which form the model space , as @xmath42 , and those which belong to the q - space , as @xmath43 .",
    "then the q - space components of an eigenvector @xmath44 of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2 ] ) can be expressed as a combination of the p - space components with the help of the operator @xmath36 @xmath45 if the dimension of the model space is @xmath46 , we may choose a set @xmath47 of @xmath46 eigenevectors , typically the lowest states obtained in each channel , for which the relation ( [ eigomega ] ) will be satisfied . under the condition that the @xmath48 matrix @xmath49 for @xmath50 is invertible , the operator @xmath36 can be determined from ( [ eigomega ] ) .",
    "once the operator @xmath36 is determined the effective hamiltonian can be constructed as follows @xmath51 \\ ; .\\ ] ] this hamiltonian , when diagonalized in a model - space basis , reproduces exactly the set @xmath47 of @xmath46 eigenvalues @xmath52 .",
    "note that the effective hamiltonian is , in general , quasi - hermitian .",
    "it can be hermitized by a similarity transformation determined from the metric operator @xmath53 .",
    "the hermitian hamiltonian is then given by @xcite @xmath54^{1/2 } h_{\\rm 2eff}\\left[p_2(1+\\omega^\\dagger\\omega ) p_2\\right]^{-1/2 } \\ ; .\\ ] ] finally , the two - body effective interaction used in the present calculations is determined from the two - nucleon effective hamiltonian ( [ hermeffomega ] ) as @xmath55 .",
    "to at least partially take into account the many - body effects neglected when using only a two - body effective interaction , we employ the recently introduced , so - called , multi - valued effective interaction approach @xcite . in that approach ,",
    "different effective interactions are used for different harmonic - oscillator excitations of the spectators .",
    "the effective interactions then carry an additional index indicating the sum of the oscillator quanta for the spectators , @xmath56 , defined by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the total oscillator quanta in the initial and final many - body states , respectively , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the total oscillator quanta in the initial and final two - nucleon states @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "@xmath64 is the minimal value of the spectator harmonic - oscillator quanta for a given system .",
    "e.g. , for a=7 , @xmath65 .",
    "different sets of the effective interaction are determined for different model spaces characterized by @xmath56 and defined by projection operators    [ projop]@xmath66    in eqs .",
    "( [ projop ] ) , @xmath67 characterizes the two - nucleon model space .",
    "it is an input parameter chosen in relation to the size of the many - nucleon model space .",
    "this multi - valued effective - interaction approach is superior to the traditional effective interaction , as confirmed also in a model calculation @xcite .",
    "we apply the formalism outlined in section [ sec2 ] for selected @xmath7-shell nuclei . in the calculations we use the reid93 nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite and consider the following isospin - breaking contributions .",
    "first , the reid93 potential differs in the @xmath1 channels for proton - neutron ( pn ) and proton - proton ( pp ) , neutron - neutron ( nn ) systems , respectively .",
    "second , we add the coulomb potential to the pp reid93 potential . consequently , using the eqs .",
    "( [ eigomega])-([hermeffomega ] ) , we derive different two - body effective interactions for the pn , pp , and nn systems .",
    "as we derive the effective interaction microscopically from the nucleon - nucleon interaction , the number of freely adjustable parameters in the calculation is limited .",
    "first , we have the choice of the model - space size in the shell - model diagonalization .",
    "that is , however , constrained by computer capabilities .",
    "the largest model space we were able to use was the space allowing all @xmath3 excitations relative to the unperturbed ground state for @xmath2 nuclei and all @xmath4 excitations relative to the unperturbed ground state for @xmath68 nuclei , respectively .",
    "the calculations were done in the m - scheme using the many - fermion - dynamics code @xcite extended to allow the use of different pn , pp , nn interactions .",
    "we note that in this study the same effective interaction is used for each isobaric chain , and thus the same model - space size is employed for all the isobars of given @xmath34 .",
    "second , our effective interactions depend on the choice of the two - nucleon model space size .",
    "the two - nucleon model space size is related to the many - nucleon model - space size , and , in principle , is determined by that size .",
    "traditionally , however , the @xmath69 space used to determine the g - matrix does not , neccesarily , coincide with the many - particle model space @xcite . in our calculation , the two - nucleon model space is characterized by a restriction on the number of harmonic - oscillator quanta @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 . here , @xmath73 is the harmonic - oscillator quantum number for the nucleon @xmath74 .",
    "this type of restriction guarantees an orthogonal transformation between the two - particle states and the relative- and center - of - mass - coordinate states . with regard to the @xmath4 calculation for the @xmath7-shell nuclei",
    ", the choice of @xmath75 appears to be appropriate .",
    "however , it has been observed in the past  @xcite that when the lee - suzuki procedure is combined with the g - matrix calculation according to ref .",
    "@xcite ( which is equivalent to the procedure we are using ) and is applied to calculate the two - body effective interaction , the resulting interaction may be too strong .",
    "this is , in particular , true , when the multi - valued approach is used .",
    "the reason for this is likely the fact that our effective interaction is computed for a two - nucleon system bound in an harmonic - oscillator potential .",
    "therefore , artificial binding from this potential is included in the effective interaction and the many - body effects coming from the large - basis space calculation do not completely compensate for this spurious binding .",
    "this effect decreases when the model - space size increases as is demonstrated in our earlier three - nucleon shell - model calculations @xcite .",
    "several possible adjustments have been discussed to deal with this problem @xcite in smaller model spaces and amount to introducing an extra parameter . in the present calculations , we use two methods introduced in the previous papers . for the @xmath9 @xmath4 calculation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we preferred to treat @xmath67 as a free parameter and use @xmath76 for the @xmath4 calculations . with this choice , which results in an overall weaker interaction than that calculated with @xmath75 , we obtain quite reasonable binding energies for all the studied nuclei .",
    "this approach is employed here for the @xmath4 calculations for the nuclei with @xmath68 . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath2 for the @xmath3 space",
    "we follow ref",
    ". @xcite and use the parameter @xmath77 introduced there . while for @xmath78 there is no modification , the choice of @xmath79 reduces the contribution of the @xmath80-space part of the harmonic - oscillator potential on the two - nucleon effective interaction . for this calculation ,",
    "@xmath76 appropriate for the @xmath3 many - nucleon space size is employed . in ref .",
    "@xcite we used this approach for the @xmath3 calculations for @xmath81 and 6 nuclei as well as for the @xmath82 calculations for @xmath83 and 4 nuclei .",
    "we note that we are studying ways on how to eliminate these extra parameters by means of renormalizations of the two - body effective interactions utilizing knowledge of the three - body effective interactions .",
    "the three - body effective interactions can be calculated following the approach introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , our results depend on the harmonic - oscillator frequency @xmath23 .",
    "we have studied this dependence by performing calculations for the values @xmath84 , and @xmath85 mev for @xmath10c and @xmath10b in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we present the same dependence for @xmath10li .",
    "for the other studied nuclei we choose @xmath86 in the range 15 - 17 mev .",
    "we keep the same value of @xmath86 for each isobaric chain .",
    "let us note that our calculations do not violate the separation of the center - of - mass and the internal relative motion .",
    "in particular , a variation of the parameter @xmath32 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ phamomegabeta ] ) does not change the eigenenergies and other characteristics of the physical states .",
    "this is so due to the utilization of a complete @xmath28 many - nucleon model space and the triangular two - nucleon model space for deriving the effective interaction as well as due to the procedure used to derive the effective interaction .      in figs .",
    "[ fig : he7 ] , [ fig : li7 ] , [ fig : be7 ] , and [ fig : b7 ] we present the experimental and calculated excitation spectra of @xmath12he , @xmath12li , @xmath12be , and @xmath12b , respectively .",
    "their ground - state properties are summarized in the first part of table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the calculations were performed in the @xmath3 model space .",
    "an harmonic - oscillator frequency of @xmath87 mev was used . as discussed earlier in this section",
    ", we employed the additional parameter @xmath77 , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and set its value to @xmath88 .",
    "note that for @xmath12li and @xmath12be , the dimension in the m - scheme reaches 663,527 .",
    "it is the largest dimension in the present study .",
    "we should mention that larger matrix dimensions have been used in other shell - model studies @xcite , although our calculations include more single - particle states .",
    "it should still be feasible to further extend our no - core calculations to higher dimensions than presented here .    in general , good agreement with experiment",
    "is found for both the ground - state characteristics as well as the low - lying excited states .",
    "we observe underbinding for @xmath12he and @xmath12b .",
    "note that for an isospin invariant interaction these states would be degenerate with the @xmath89 isopin states of @xmath12li or @xmath12be .",
    "so this underbinding is equivalent to too much spread in the excitation spectrum .",
    "this is a common feature in the no - core shell - model calculations , which diminishes as the model - space size increases .",
    "note in figs .",
    "[ fig : li7 ] and [ fig : be7 ] the correct ordering of excited states in most cases .",
    "also the magnetic moment of @xmath12li is nicely reproduced .",
    "the radii and the quadrupole moments are typically smaller in absolute value in our calculations .",
    "we used bare nucleon charges , so there is still need for e2 effective charges despite our large model - space size . by examining the calculated quadrupole matrix elements , we can deduce that effective charges of @xmath90 and @xmath91 are needed to obtain the experimental quadrupole moment of @xmath12li .",
    "we note that these effective charges are significantly smaller than the standard effective charges , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , typically employed in @xmath94 shell - model calculations .",
    "the @xmath12li calculation can be compared to the previously published @xmath4 no - core calculation of ref .",
    "apart from the larger model - space size in the present calculation , we also take into account more realistically the isospin breaking and derive the effective interaction in a different way .",
    "the results are not dramatically different .",
    "however , the present @xmath3 calculation provides a better overall agreement with the experiment .",
    "our results can also be compared to the recent greens - function monte carlo ( gfmc ) and variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculations @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the gfmc calculations are qualitatively different .",
    "no effective interaction is used and the aim is to obtain the exact many - body solutions . as the vmc is an upper bound variational calculation , it is more appropriate to compare the present shell - model calculations with the gfmc , which includes all the statistically sampled correlations in the system .",
    "because the gfmc calculations are much more involved than vmc , they have not been carried out for all excited states .",
    "we should also mention that the gfmc and vmc calculations were done with the argonne v18 interaction . as both the argonne v18 interaction and the reid93 interaction ( that we used ) describe the nn scattering data more - or - less equally well , a different choice of potential should not cause significant difference in the obtained results . in addition ,",
    "a real three - body interaction was included in the gfmc and vmc , unlike in our calculations .",
    "still , it is interesting to note some similarities between our shell - model calculations and the vmc and gfmc results for @xmath2 .",
    "our @xmath12li calculation shows correct level ordering for the lowest five states , while the sixth and seventh states are interchaged in comparison to the experiment .",
    "the same feature is found in the vmc calculation .",
    "also our higher excited states have energies typically too large , similar to the vmc and gfmc . on the other hand ,",
    "the excitation spectrum of @xmath12he , obtained in our calculation , has energies about two times higher than those of the vmc , although the level ordering is the same .",
    "in addition , in both approaches a larger decrease in the calculated binding energies is observed for isobars with higher ground - state isospin than is observed experimentally .      in figs .",
    "[ fig : he8 ] , [ fig : li8 ] , [ fig : be8 ] , and [ fig : b8 ] we present the experimental and calculated excitation spectra of @xmath14he , @xmath14li , @xmath14be , and @xmath14b , respectively .",
    "their ground - state properties are summarized in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the calculations were performed in a model space of up to @xmath4 excitations relative to the unperturbed ground - state configuration .",
    "an harmonic - oscillator frequency of @xmath87 mev was used .",
    "as explained earlier in this section , the two - body effective interaction was evaluated using @xmath76 .",
    "we note that the same effective interaction was used for all the @xmath13 isobars .    like in the case of the @xmath2 nuclei",
    ", we obtain a good description of the ground state properties as well as of the low - lying excitation spectra .",
    "in particular , for @xmath14be we have excellent agreement with the experiment for all positive - parity states below the excitation energy of 20 mev .",
    "we note that the @xmath95 @xmath96 doublets show significant isospin mixing compared to other calculated states . in our calculations",
    ", the lower state always has the @xmath1 component dominant .",
    "we note that electromagnetic properties of the 16.6 and 16.9 mev @xmath97 doublet in @xmath14be were recently analyzed @xcite .",
    "the doublet has almost equal admixtures of @xmath98 and @xmath1 components . in table",
    "[ tab : tab2 ] we compare the experimentally extracted isoscalar and isovector electromagnetic transition rates from the doublet with those obtained in our shell - model calculation .",
    "our results can also be compared with other shell - model calculations as presented in table iii of ref .",
    "in those calculations , phenomenological effective interactions of refs . @xcite were employed .",
    "our calculation provides excellent agreement with experiment for the m1 properties and , unlike the other shell - model calculations used for the analysis , gives the positive sign of the isoscalar - isovector matrix element ratio in agreement with experiment . also , unlike the other shell - model calculations discussed , we obtained stronger isoscalar than isovector transition strength for the transition to the 0 + state .",
    "we note that bare nucleon charges were employed in our calculations and that the e2 transitions as well as the quadrupole moments are typically underestimated .",
    "this indicates a need for effective e2 charges despite the large model space used . in order to reproduce the @xmath14li and @xmath14b quadrupole moments , we need average effective charges of @xmath99 and @xmath100 for this isobaric chain , with smaller values for @xmath14li than for @xmath14b .",

    "the largest difference between our results and the vmc results is in the position of @xmath106 states of @xmath14he and @xmath14li . in the vmc calculations their excitation energy is significantly lower than that obtained in the shell - model calculations .",
    "as the vmc gives an upper bound , the gfmc result would be lower still .",
    "the @xmath14he nucleus is a weakly bound system , where scattering to the continuum will play an important role in the structure of higher - lying states .",
    "because the harmonic - oscillator basis employed in our shell - model calculations has incorrect asymptotics for the single - particle wave - functions , we would not expect our calculation to describe well the higher - lying states in weakly bound systems .",
    "the magnetic moments obtained in our shell - model calculations for the @xmath2 and @xmath13 nuclei are in some cases in a better agreement with the experiment than those obtained by the vmc . on the other hand ,",

    "in most cases our calculated splitting is larger than the corresponding experimental splitting , though the difference does not exceed about 10% .",
    "mainly the coulomb energy is responsible for the isospin - analog - state splitting . as our calculated proton radii are typically smaller than the experimental ones , we obtain stronger coulomb splitting .",
    "we discussed this point in ref . @xcite and pointed out the importance of the correct value of the proton radius in order to get the correct isopin - analog - state splitting .",
    "for @xmath119 nuclei we performed calculations only for the @xmath17li and @xmath17be . in the last part of table [ tab : tab1 ] we show the ground - state properties of @xmath17li and the lowest negative - parity state of @xmath17be . in fig .",
    "[ fig : be11 ] we present the experimental and calculated negative - parity spectra of @xmath17be .",
    "the calculations were performed in the @xmath4 model space using @xmath120 mev .",
    "we note that the ground state of @xmath17be is a positive - parity state @xmath121 .",
    "we also performed calculations for the positive parity states in the @xmath122 model space .",
    "we got a correct level ordering for the lowest positive - parity states .",
    "however , those states were shifted with respect to the negative - parity states by 5.56 mev , so that the calculated ground state has a negative parity .",
    "it should be realized that the relative position of the positive- and negative - parity states depends on the size of the respective model spaces .",
    "it is quite likely that a @xmath123 model - space calculation would result in a positive - parity ground state .",
    "our @xmath4 model space is insufficient for reproducing the halo properties of the @xmath17li nucleus .",
    "this is seen , in particular , in a smaller calculated point - proton rms radius as well as a smaller absolute value of the quadrupole moment compared with the experiment . in order to reproduce the @xmath17li experimental quadrupole moment ,",
    "we need effective charges of @xmath124 and @xmath125 . on the other hand",
    ", we easily obtain the correct ground - state spin , a reasonable binding energy as well as the magnetic moment .",
    "we note that the rms point - proton radii obtained in our calculations are smaller than the experimental ones with the largest discrepancies for @xmath126li and @xmath127b , e.g. , nuclei far from the stability .",
    "one should remark , however , that the experimental extraction of the rms radii is model dependent .",
    "we have performed large - basis no - core shell - model calculations for selected @xmath7-shell nuclei with @xmath128 .",
    "we used two - body effective interactions derived from the reid93 nucleon - nucleon potential with the isospin breaking taken into account .",
    "we were able to reproduce most of the characteristics of the ground states as well as the correct ordering of the lowest excited states .",
    "as discussed in detail in section iii , our no - core shell - model approach has only a very limited number of freely adjustable parameters , such as the harmonic - oscillator frequency and the size of the model space .",
    "the calculations were performed in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 model spaces for the @xmath2 and @xmath129 nuclei , respectively .",
    "our results show , that the multi - configuration shell - model approach combined with the use of microscopic effective interactions is capable of a good qualitative and quantitative description of the @xmath7-shell nuclei .",
    "it is feasible to extend the present @xmath4 calculations to heavier @xmath7-shell nuclei as well . for those nuclei slightly higher m - scheme dimensions than in the present calculations will have to be dealt with .",
    "the present results can be used for calculating electromagnetic and weak properties and scattering characteristics as well as other applications , like , e.g. , @xmath12be@xmath130b nuclear vertex constant . with regard to the effective - interaction theory",
    ", it is desirable to eliminate some of the free parameters still present in the calculations by using three - body effective interactions . in particular",
    ", we should be able to eliminate the treatment of the two - nucleon model - space size prameter @xmath67 as an adjustable parameter , or alternatively the use of the parameter @xmath77 employed in our @xmath3 calculations , in this way .",
    "also , the use of the three - body effective interaction should weaken the dependence on the harmonic - oscillator frequency .",
    "we are presently investigating this aspect in four - nucleon shell - model calculations .",
    "a complete elimination of the dependence of the results on the harmonic - oscillator frequency will hardly be achieved , however , in the model - spaces of only a few @xmath86 above the unperturbed ground - state configuration , although it can be greatly weakened .",
    "our investigation of the three - nucleon shell - model calculations @xcite supports this statement .",
    "most likely , the three - body effective interaction should not be used directly as an input into the shell - model calculation , but rather it should be utilized for renormalizing the two - body effective interactions .",
    "work in this direction is under way .",
