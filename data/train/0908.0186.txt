    "direct observations of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources would open a new window to the universe , and a new era of astronomy .",
    "it is now well known that there are many gravitational lens systems of various sorts in the electromagnetic astronomy .",
    "this must also happens in gravitational wave astronomy in the future .",
    "one difference between electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves are their wavelength .",
    "the wavelength of gravitational waves which the currently working and the planned gravitational wave observatories may detect are typically much larger than the electromagnetic waves in the current astronomy . therefore once they suffer from gravitational lensing , we have a chance to observe interference . to be more quantitatively ,",
    "a condition may be met for interference to be seen . in the electromagnetic astronomy ,",
    "a wave source is typically extended and it consists of pieces of incoherent emitters .",
    "then , to observe interference , the typical linear dimension of the source @xmath0 should be smaller than or comparable to the wavelength @xmath1 divided by the angular separation among the multiple images @xmath2 ( in radians ) , or @xmath3 with @xmath4 of order unity in a typical gravitational lensing occurring in cosmology .",
    "otherwise incoherent waves from different parts of the source distract the interference . observing at , say , @xmath5 m and assuming @xmath6 radians , @xmath7 cm .",
    "this is one reason why we usually do not see interference in the electromagnetic astronomy .",
    "one exception where wave effects become important is scintillation for radio sources due to ionized interstellar / interplanetary gas ( see , e.g. , chap .",
    "13.4 of @xcite ) . as an application , for example",
    ", the size of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) can be estimated using the interstellar scintillation of radio afterglow of a grb ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , there are compact gravitational wave sources whose linear sizes are of order the wavelength they emit .",
    "these include relativistic coalescing binaries such as neutron stars binaries and isolated non - axisymmetric pulsars , both of which are two of the most promising sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) for the gravitational wave detectors that are currently working or planned , such as ligo @xcite , lcgt @xcite , lisa @xcite , bbo @xcite , and decigo @xcite . at around the bbo / decigo observing frequency of @xmath8hz , the orbital separation @xmath0 of a neutron stars binary would be @xmath9 , while @xmath10 @xmath0 .    in the above argument",
    ", we saw that there is an upper limit on the size of the emitter to see interference .",
    "this is not a sufficient condition for interference pattern to form in the space and for us to observe its amplitude changing as the earth ( or a detector ) moves in that spatial pattern . for a clear interference pattern to form in the space ,",
    "coherence time must be larger than the time delay among multiple images .",
    "note that the coherence time is of order @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the frequency shift during an observation .",
    "suppose an extragalactic neutron stars binary as a gravitational wave source . then to have a large enough signal to noise ratio with bbo / decigo to claim detection",
    ", we may integrate the signal from the binary for a couple of years during which the signal frequency of the source binary would shift over of order of the bbo / decigo observing frequency , @xmath13 hz . the coherence time would then be @xmath14 seconds , which is smaller than , for example , the time delays of the known gravitational lensing systems listed in the castle data base @xcite .",
    "so unless the time delay is smaller than @xmath15 seconds or the source is highly monochromatic , we are not in a situation where we ( on the earth ) move in a clear spatial interference pattern .    the above argument does not preclude a possibility of detecting an interference term in the time domain , or equivalently , in the frequency domain . in this paper , we do not aim to detect an interference pattern in the space .",
    "rather , we propose a method of a filtered cross - correlation of gravitational lens images in the frequency domain .",
    "we shall point out that the interference term contains information of the relative transverse velocity of the source - lens - observer system and study how well we could determine it using the future bbo / decigo detector .",
    "there have already been several works that point out importance of interference and , more broadly , wave optics effects in gravitational lensing phenomena of gravitational waves @xcite . since a gravitational wave source such as",
    "a coalescing binary is essentially a point source , we have to use wave optics rather than geometrical optics approximation for such a source near caustics @xcite .",
    "the works @xcite studied observable effects on the gravitational waves propagating in an inhomogeneous universe . in this paper , we propose a method for extracting an interference term in the geometrical optics limit and for obtaining information on a relative transverse velocity of the source - lens - observer system .",
    "there are various methods to measure a relative transverse velocity of astronomical objects at a cosmological distance in the electromagnetic astronomy .",
    "those includes for example , a method to measure transverse velocities of clusters of galaxies detecting a signature of gravitational scattering of the cosmic microwave background @xcite and to measure those of galaxies using a parallax effect due to gravitational micro - lensing @xcite .",
    "possibilities are also discussed in in the gravitational lens literature by @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing of gravitational waves possibly offers another way to measure a relative transverse velocity of cosmological objects in addition to those methods above .",
    "our method could be applied to various sources including continuous waves from pulsars , cosmic strings and so on .",
    "however , to be specific , we consider a coalescence neutron stars binary at a cosmological distance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain our situation by discussing a ( astronomical scale ) young s interference experiment . in sec .",
    "iii , we remind readers of the basic equations and the notations for study of gravitational lensing of gravitational waves , for which we follow @xcite .",
    "after remarks on a situation we would be in when searching for gravitational lensing of gravitational waves and on the geometrical optics approximation , sec iv explains how to extract interference term when the approximation applies . in the section [ sec : transversevelocity ] ,",
    "we propose a method for extracting information contained in the interference term , namely , the relative transverse velocity of the source - lens - observer system .",
    "we then study a correlation between the time delay and the transverse velocity in sec [ sec : correlation_time_delay_and_transverse_velocity ] and a correlation among parameters in [ sec : correlation_among_parameters ] in the absence of noise .",
    "[ sec : accuracy ] then shows the precision to which we could measure a transverse velocity by introducing detector noise .",
    "the section [ sec : summary ] gives summary of our result .    in this paper",
    "we use a unit of @xmath16 unless otherwise written explicitly .",
    "an amplitude of a gravitational wave inversely depends on the luminosity distance from the observer to the source , to compute which we assume a flat universe with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "to explain our situation , consider the ( astronomical scale ) young s two pin - holes interference experiment . the ( gravitational ) wave intensity @xmath20 at the observer s time and position @xmath21 on the screen is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the distance from the @xmath24-th pin - hole to the observer and @xmath25 is the phase of the wave from the @xmath24-th pin - hole .",
    "we neglect the difference in @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the amplitude and write @xmath28 .",
    "the phase difference @xmath29 may be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the source retarded time for the wave through the pin - hole 1 , @xmath32 is the time length for a wave crest to propagate from the source to the observer through the @xmath24-th pin - hole , and @xmath33 is the time delay between two pin - holes .    for a monochromatic wave at the frequency @xmath34 constant , @xmath35 and",
    "the scale of the interference pattern is @xmath36 ( @xmath2 being the angular separation of the two pin - holes seen from the observer ) as usual . known possible monochromatic gravitational wave sources are isolated pulsars .",
    "the planned next generation gravitational wave antennas would see those within the milky way galaxy .",
    "so considering micro - lensing phenomena on a gravitational wave emitted by an isolated millisecond pulsar in a globular cluster ( say ) , the spatial scale of the interference pattern is @xmath37 suppose , in the spatial interference pattern due to the monochromatic wave , we move at 200 km / s ( about the orbital speed of the solar system around the galactic center ) , it takes @xmath38 years for us to go across the spatial interference pattern .",
    "the wave intensity will vary in time as @xmath39    in principle , for a monochromatic wave , we would be able to detect relative transverse velocity of the source - lens - observer system by using interference pattern ( by measuring the temporal variation of @xmath40 ) . if we recognise such interference pattern , we would conclude that gravitational force shows interference phenomena and propagate as `` wave '' .",
    "other than that , the information we could obtain , @xmath41 , is in principle the same as that in micro - lensing experiments in the conventional electromagnetic astronomy .",
    "( and the number of millisecond pulsars is much smaller than that of the stars in the magellanic clouds , say . )",
    "when observing pulsars within the milky way , it is also important to note that diffraction effect becomes non - negligible when gravitational wavelength @xmath1 is larger than the lens mass @xmath42 @xcite , or @xmath43 .",
    "if we observe interference of gravitational waves from pulsars in the milky way , then the lens should have mass larger than @xmath44    eq .",
    "( [ eq : interferencepatternscale ] ) suggests a cosmological application of gravitational lensing phenomena on gravitational waves .",
    "@xmath45 unfortunately for our purpose of seeing an interference pattern , the most promising cosmological sources , relativistic compact binaries in an inspiralling phase , do not emit monochromatic wave .",
    "for such a source the frequency of the gravitational wave varies in time , to the lowest order , @xmath46 with @xmath47 is the chirp mass , @xmath48 being the mass of the @xmath24-th star in the binary . for wave",
    "having time - varying frequency @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 constants , @xmath52 with @xmath53 at which inspiralling phase ends and the binary stars crush into each other .",
    "the interference pattern changes with time even if there is no relative transverse velocity in the system .",
    "moreover because of the smallness of the amplitudes of possible gravitational waves , we normally need to integrate signals for some time duration to get a sufficiently - large - for - claiming - detection signal to noise ratio .",
    "schematically , we would do @xmath54 @xmath55 is determined by either the source lifetime , its pass - time over the frequency band of our detector , or a pre - set threshold for claiming detection ( , say , signal to noise ratio larger than 5 ) .",
    "large @xmath55 in the integration makes the interference term vanishingly smaller than the bolometric ( non - interference ) term . for a massive compact binary ,",
    "depending on binary masses , it is possible that @xmath56 so that one wave packet through the pin - hole 1 comes to the detector , and after some quiet period , the second through the pin - hole 2 visits it . in this case , no interference pattern forms in the space and we would detect their interference by taking a cross - correlation ( in a computer ) .",
    "this paper shall use a filtered cross - correlation technique to take care of the issues above .",
    "but before moving onto explaining the technique we use in this paper , we start our discussion by explaining lensed waveform of gravitational waves in the next section .",
    "we consider a coalescence compact stars binary at the redshift @xmath57 with the redshifted chirp mass @xmath58 as a target source to be lensed . the detector is assumed to be a space borne interferometer such as ( one - triangle ) bbo / decigo , which outputs two independent data streams @xmath59 .",
    "when the gravitational wave from the binary is lensed by a lensing object of redshifted mass @xmath60 , the wave through the @xmath61-th image to the detector in the frequency domain would be written , in the geometrical optics limit and in the stationary phase approximation , as @xcite @xmath62 with @xmath63 where @xmath64 and 1 when the j - th image corresponds to a minimum , saddle , and maximum point , respectively .",
    "@xmath65 is written in terms of the detector beam pattern functions @xmath66 @xcite and defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 ( given by @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 ( given by @xmath71 ) are the direction unit vector of the binary orbital angular momentum and the direction unit vector toward the j - th image .",
    "these vectors are defined in the fixed barycenter frame of the solar system .",
    "the detector phase @xmath72 and the source phase @xmath73 are @xmath74 where @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 1 year for bbo / decigo ( those detectors are planned to orbit around the solar system barycenter with its average orbital radius 1 au . for simplicity we assumed a circular orbit for the detector here ) .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational wave @xmath50 and the phase of the gravitational wave @xmath78 , to the newtonian approximation , are @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the source angular diameter distance . @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the amplification factor and the time delay for the j - th image measured with respect to the fictitious time of arrival of non - lensed signal . @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 are the time and the phase of the binary coalescence . finally , the time variable @xmath86 in the above equations must be understood to be a function of frequency as @xmath87    in a gravitational wave search , the unknown parameters would be , to the lowest order , @xmath88 where the last three depend on the lens property .",
    "we consider the following situation .",
    "first of all , for simplicity we study that two images occur due to gravitational lensing .",
    "then the wave from one lens image would be in the detector s observation frequency band in the time duration from , say , @xmath89 to @xmath90",
    ". the second wave would be in the band after the time delay @xmath91 later from @xmath92 to @xmath93 .",
    "we assume the observation frequency and the time delay satisfy @xmath94 so that we can use the geometrical optics approximation ( @xcite studied the case where wave optics is important ) . as as result",
    ", we may detect the two waves separately using unlensed waveform templates as if those were unlensed , in the same sky direction ( the angular resolution of the gravitational wave source is @xmath95(signal to noise ratio)@xmath96 radians with the current bbo design @xcite , so we do not expect to resolve images ) .",
    "we would then realize that those two waves have similar parameters sets @xmath97 , and conclude that those two are actually due to one lensed event .",
    "we may find the ( relative ) time delay @xmath98 and the ratio of the magnification @xmath99 .",
    "the observational errors of these two numbers are at the same level as those of @xmath84 and @xmath50 .",
    "we might now cross - correlate the two waves to see interference between these two ( in a computer ) .",
    "however , a simple cross - correlation disappears when the geometrical optics approximation applies ( and this is the reason we could detect two waves separately , anyway ) .",
    "let us see this using some equations below and propose a method to extract information contained in the interference term even in this case .",
    "we consider a sort of cross - correlation between the two waves , given by ( [ eq : lensedwaveform ] ) .",
    "we use the waves with the supports in the time domain assumed to be from @xmath100 to @xmath90 for the wave that reaches the detector first , and from @xmath101 to @xmath102 for the second . the detector s",

    "the frequency domain support of @xmath107 in the time segment @xmath50 is lower than @xmath109 .",
    "we now compute a simple cross - correlation between the two waves as @xmath111 with @xmath112 the one - sided spectral density of the detector s noise . because we defined the integral region from @xmath109 to @xmath110 so that there is no auto - correlation term of @xmath113 which otherwise appears due to @xmath107 term in @xmath114 .",

    "now , how can we extract non - zero cross - correlation ? we propose a filtered cross - correlation statistic .",
    "we multiply the two images , and before the frequency domain integration we further multiply @xmath118 where @xmath119 , the tuplet @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 denoting a template .",

    "we can measure @xmath129 using gravitational lensing phenomena in the usual electromagnetic astronomy . when one can use information in an interference term",
    ", we could get new information on the lens / source object : its relative transverse velocity .",
    "when there is a relative velocity among the source - lens - observer , there may be two effects .",
    "one is the time variation of the direction of the images @xmath70 , which may not be detected for cosmological sources in the foreseeable future because of the poor pointing ability of the planned gravitational wave detectors .",
    "the other is the doppler effect which causes rescaling of the mass of the source , the time variables and the amplitudes of the gravitational waves .",
    "the rescaling due to the doppler effect differs for different images as @xmath130 and @xmath131 and @xmath132 with @xmath133 where the velocity @xmath134 is a linear combination of the observer velocity @xmath135 , the lens velocity @xmath136 , and the source velocity @xmath137 as @xcite @xmath138 with @xmath139 being the angular diameter distance between the lens and the source .",
    "the lensed gravitational waveform from a coalescing binary now becomes @xmath140 with @xmath141 if there is only one image , then we could not resolve the degeneracy and would get , in principle , a biased estimate of the masses and the source distance . however , if we know in advance that we see multi - waves due to gravitational lensing ( see sec .
