    "high pressure studies form an important area of research in solid state physics . over the years",
    "such studies have provided useful insight into our understanding of the physical properties of solids@xcite .",
    "pressure has basically two effects on the electrons in solids : increased kinetic energy and accompanying change in the effects of coulomb interaction among the electrons . in typical band structure calculations",
    "the former effect is captured via increased overlap of the basis orbitals , leading to increased hopping matrix elements and band broadening .",
    "the changes in the correlation effects are captured via self - consistency of charge and potential , as dictated by the density functional theory and its variants ( e.g. generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , local density approximation with on - site coulomb interaction ( lda+u ) ) . both of these affect magnetic properties of materials such as exchange interaction , local moments , curie temperature and resistivity due to magnetic scattering .",
    "of particular importance for metallic magnets are the change in the fermi surface and the hybridization between different orbitals , which influences the itinerant vs. localized nature of the charge carriers .",
    "it is a useful exercise to explore how the existing theories of electronic and magnetic structure calculation fare in describing the pressure variation of these physical properties . in the present paper",
    "we study the pressure - dependence of the curie temperature and the resistivity of some quaternary heusler alloys , which form an important class of magnetic materials , with potential industrial / technological applications@xcite .",
    "the present work is a natural continuation of our previous paper @xcite in which we presented an extensive study of the magnetic and transport properties of these alloys at ambient pressure .",
    "there exists a number of experimental studies of the variation of the curie temperature ( t@xmath4 ) under pressure for elemental ferromagnets , transition - metal alloys @xcite , as well as heusler alloys @xcite including co@xmath0tial , @xcite ni@xmath0mnsn , @xcite pd@xmath0mnsn and some others @xcite .",
    "recently diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite and some random heusler alloys @xcite have also been studied . however , the corresponding experimental studies of the pressure - dependence of the resistivity are rare : one example of such a study is the work by austin and mishra @xcite",
    ".    several studies of the ambient / equilibrium electronic and magnetic properties of such alloys have appeared recently@xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the pressure - dependence of the curie temperature of elemental transition metal ferromagnets include model - based studies @xcite as well as recent first - principles calculations .",
    "@xcite turek @xcite have studied the pressure - dependence of the curie temperature in hcp gd and found a strong dependence of @xmath5 on the @xmath6 ratio , which , they suggested , can be related to the measured @xmath5 of thick epitaxial gd(0001 ) films on various transition - metal substrates .",
    "similar calculations have also been carried out for the intermetallic compound gdal@xmath7 @xcite and for cr - based compounds in the zinc blende structure .",

    "_ , @xcite where the experimentally observed increase of @xmath5 with pressure @xcite in ni@xmath0mnsn was reproduced correctly , albeit only qualitatively so . there exists some other studies of heusler alloys in which the dependence of the exchange integrals on volume contraction / expansion @xcite was explored .",
    "the particular heusler systems considered in this work are the ( ni@xmath1,cu@xmath2)@xmath0mnsn and ( ni@xmath1,pd@xmath2)@xmath0mnsn alloys .",
    "we employ the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) to treat the disorder in the ni - sublattice due to doping with cu- or pd - atoms .",
    "it is well known that cpa neglects the effects of short - range order , which are often present in random alloys . however , for the cases under study , such effects should be weak , as we need to describe the magnetic interactions on the non - random mn sublattice , which is only indirectly influenced by the randomness of the transition - metal sublattice via hybridization",
    ". the most important effect of disorder is , therefore , the change in carrier concentration , which is well - described by the cpa . in a recent paper @xcite , it was demonstrated that the cpa provides a reasonably good description of the electronic structure for the case of disorder on the magnetic sublattice as well .",
    "the electronic structure calculations are performed employing the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) basis @xcite and the density functional theory ( dft ) . the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) for the exchange - correlation part of the potential",
    "the effect of substitutional disorder among ( ni , cu ) or ( ni , pd ) atoms is described by the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) as formulated in the framework of the tb - lmto green function method .",
    "@xcite the calculations employ an @xmath8-basis , the same atomic radii are adopted for all atoms , and the vosko - wilk - nusair exchange - correlation potential @xcite is used .",
    "the exchange interactions and curie temperatures are studied here by employing a classical heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the exchange integral between mn atoms at sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are unit vectors in the directions of the local magnetization on sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the parameters of the heisenberg hamiltonian are obtained using a two - step approach .",
    "@xcite the reference state for our calculations is chosen to be the disordered local moment ( dlm ) state , @xcite which was successfully used in previous studies .",
    "@xcite the exchange interactions @xmath10 can be expressed in the framework of the tb - lmto method as @xmath15 where @xmath16 characterizes the exchange splitting of the mn atom at the site @xmath11 , @xmath17 is the configurationally averaged green function describing the motion of an electron with spin @xmath18 , @xmath19 , between mn sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the integration is done over the contour @xmath20 in the complex energy plane @xmath21 which starts below the valence band and ends at the fermi energy .",

    "further details on the exchange interactions evaluated in the dlm reference state can be found in ref .  .",
    "we have found that the mapping can be improved ( providing a better agreement of calculated @xmath5 with the experiment ) by including the electron correlation effect on ni - sites in the framework of the lsda+u method ( see fig .  1 in ref .  ) .",
    "the electron correlations on pd - sites are found to have negligible influence on the calculated @xmath5 .",
    "we determine the curie temperature corresponding to the heisenberg hamiltonian using the rpa @xcite and by including all exchange interactions up to @xmath26 4 lattice constants .",
    "the pressure is simulated by reduction of the lattice constants from their ambient pressure values , as reported in experiments ( see table 4 of ref .   and table 2 of ref .  ) .",
    "in ref .   an empirical pressure - volume relation was given for ni@xmath0mnsn .",
    "although such a relation can be obtained entirely from theoretical calculations , in the present study , as in ref .  , we simply reduce the lattice constant and estimate the corresponding pressure from the empirical pressure - volume relation . according to both the empirical pressure - volume relation@xcite and theoretical calculations@xcite , a 3  % reduction of the lattice",
    "constant corresponds roughly to a pressure of 16  gpa in ni@xmath0mnsn .    in heusler alloys ( ni@xmath1,t@xmath2)@xmath0mnsn ( t = cu , pd )",
    "the effect of disorder among the ni- and t - atoms at the fermi energy @xmath27 is weak because the ni- and t - states lie well below @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite consequently , the corresponding residual resistivity is small .",
    "the resistivity due to phonon scattering @xcite is known to be small as well .",
    "the dominant contribution to the resistivity , thus , is from the spin - disorder scattering , which increases with temperature , reaching its maximum value at @xmath5 . in ref .",
    "we employed a simplified approach to estimate the temperature - dependent resistivity in ( ni@xmath1,pd@xmath2)@xmath0mnsn heusler alloys .",
    "it was shown that the spin - disorder at and above @xmath5 can be described satisfactorily using the dlm model , and the corresponding resistivity can be described by the kubo - greenwood approach adapted to the tb - lmto method .",
    "@xcite we have used the same approach to study the resistivity under pressure as well . for further details concerning computational techniques we refer the reader to our recent paper .",
    "@xcite    the method we have used is based on mapping the ( @xmath28 ) total energy to an effective heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "in fact it is just the band energy , not the total energy , which is considered in the mapping , by appealing to the so - called magnetic force theorem(see ref .",
    "( ) and references therein ) .",
    "for finite temperature ( @xmath29 ) calculations , as would be appropriate for the dlm reference state , one needs to consider the mapping of the free energy @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the internal energy and @xmath32 is the entropy .",
    "@xmath31 should include the electronic and the average vibrational energy and @xmath32 should include both electronic and vibrational entropy .",
    "electronic energy should be calculated via finite temperature density functional theory .",
    "this free energy can not , in principle , be mapped to an effective heisenberg form , which includes only the electronic parameter ( spin or magnetic moment ) .",
    "such a scheme could be implemented for a supercell calculation . however , the advantage of being able to calculate exchange interactions up to a large distance with relative ease and reasonable accuracy and therefore predict results and trends for a group of materials will be gone . for finite temperatures , both electronic excitations and lattice vibrations will influence magnetic properties .",
    "however , in the absence of an accurate scheme , we will refrain from speculating on these effects on our results .",
    "in this section we present results for the pressure - dependence of the curie temperature and spin - disorder resistivity of ( ni@xmath1,t@xmath2)@xmath0mnsn ( t = cu , pd ) heusler alloys over a broad range of concentrations .",
    "we start with a brief review of previous theoretical studies , both model - based and first - principles .",
    "theoretical study of the pressure - dependence of @xmath5 on a model level has usually been based on a discussion of the indirect exchange interaction among spins @xcite or on the hubbard model of magnetism .",
    "@xcite it is clear that the pressure - dependence of @xmath5 carries information about the volume - dependence of the electron wave functions @xcite ( bloch functions in the case of crystalline solids ) . in an rkky - type indirect exchange interaction model , the volume - dependence of @xmath5 can be related to the volume dependencies of the density of states at the fermi level @xmath33 and the exchange integral or the matrix element of the exchange interaction between the wave functions at the fermi energy @xcite(henceforth referred to as the bare exchange interaction @xmath34 , see eq.([eqjbare ] ) ) .",
    "the density of states at the fermi level usually decreases with pressure ( unless , under pressure , new bands start crossing the fermi level ) , as the bands broaden due to increased overlap between the orbitals centered on neighboring atoms .",
    "the bare exchange integral usually increases under pressure , due to increased overlap of the wave functions .",
    "the above two effects compete with each other in determining the final change of @xmath35 under pressure .    in a description based on the hubbard model ,",
    "the band terms and the term involving the intra - atomic coulomb interaction @xmath31 are written separately . in this case",
    "it is possible to divide the volume / pressure - dependence of @xmath5 into a term originating from the band broadening under pressure and another that relates to the volume - dependence of @xmath31 .",
    "the importance of this latter term for the pressure - dependence of @xmath5 in ni and ni - cu alloys was first pointed out by lang and ehrenreich .",
    "@xcite they argued that it is this term involving the intra - atomic coulomb interaction that is responsible for the increase in @xmath5 under pressure ( @xmath36 ) in ni and the decrease of @xmath37 with the increase of cu - concentration in ni - cu alloys .",
    "in _ ab initio _ calculations based on dft , such as ours , the above effects are merged together and it is hard to delineate one from the other . the advantage , of course , is that the exchange interactions are realistically calculated for the system at hand , and no assumption related to the volume - dependence of any parameter needs to be made .",
    "prototypical studies in this direction are refs .  , addressing the pressure - dependence of the curie temperature of bcc iron .",
    "in particular , a very recent first - principles study @xcite seems to agree with experiment , which gives essentially no pressure - dependence of @xmath5 .",
    "the authors describe this result as a balance between the band structure effect which reduces the magnetization and an increase of the bare exchange integrals with decreasing volume , as mentioned above .",
    "a somewhat different situation is encountered for fcc - ni .",
    "this metal is a strong ferromagnet , its magnetic moment depends on pressure only weakly and an increase of exchange integrals under pressure thus dominates . as a result , @xmath35 of fcc - ni increases with pressure . in general",
    "both effects are relevant and the observed change of @xmath35 under pressure is a result of the competition between them .",

    "the increase of the bare exchange interactions with pressure is clearly seen for the first five neighbors ( see fig .",
    "it is also obvious that magnetic moments decrease with the pressure , as expected .",
    "these two effects , i.e. , enhancement of @xmath40 and suppression of magnetic moments , both due to the volume decrease , compete with each other , resulting in smaller pressure - induced changes of the effective interactions @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "the final result in the present case is an enhancement of @xmath5 under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "the same qualitative explanation was put forward by csontos @xcite for the increase of @xmath5 with pressure in some diluted magnetic semiconductors .      in this section",
    "we present and compare results for ( ni , pd)@xmath0mnsn and ( ni , cu)@xmath0mnsn heusler alloys , with ni@xmath0mnsn considered as the reference case .",
    "the heusler alloy ni@xmath0mnsn was studied theoretically in great detail in a recent paper , @xcite while corresponding experimental results can be found in refs .   and  .",
    "the experiments give the rate of increase of @xmath5 with pressure around 0.62  k / kbar @xcite ( for pressures up to 10  kbar or 1  gpa ) and 0.744  k / kbar for higher pressures up to 9  gpa .",
    "@xcite the authors of the theoretical study @xcite employ the frozen - magnon approach and inverse lattice fourier transform to construct the effective heisenberg hamiltonian , which is then analyzed in the framework of the multisublattice mfa .",
    "they obtain an increase of @xmath5 by 38  k for pressures around 16  gpa , an increase from the ambient value @xmath5=362  k to @xmath5=400  k. our estimated values are @xmath5=322 ( 334 )  k for ambient pressure and @xmath5=375 ( 401 )  k ( an increase of 53 ( 67 )  k for 3% reduction of the lattice constant , roughly corresponding to the same pressure @xmath26 16  gpa ) .",
    "the values in brackets correspond to the model assuming electron correlations on ni - sites ( the effective hubbard @xmath44 chosen is 2  ev ) . assuming linear relation between @xmath5 and pressure , the experimental increase is expected to be around 100@xmath45120  k. the theory thus correctly predicts a pressure - induced increase of @xmath5 , while the absolute increase is at least three times ( ref . ) to 1.5@xmath451.8-times ( present study ) too small .",
    "the experimental data for pd@xmath0mnsn heusler alloys that we have come across in the literature @xcite also indicate an increase of @xmath5 with pressure at a rate of 0.75  k / kbar , the same @xcite or almost the same @xcite as that for ni@xmath0mnsn . we have correctly obtained an increase of @xmath5 for 3% reduction of the ambient pressure lattice constant , as in the case of ni@xmath0mnsn .",
    "specifically , @xmath5 is increased by 40  k , a value smaller than but still comparable to that for ni@xmath0mnsn and in reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "we find that any additional ( i.e. , in addition to that given by lsda ) coulomb term @xmath31 on pd - sites has a negligible effect on @xmath35 or its pressure - dependence .",
    "the hockey - stick - like variation of the composition dependence of @xmath35 for ni@xmath1,pd@xmath46)@xmath0mnsn alloys at ambient pressure is captured in the rpa , but not in the mfa .",
    "the rpa is equivalent to including the reaction field ( or the onsager cavity field ) effect in the calculation of @xmath35 ( see , for example , cyrot@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our results point to the importance of including the reaction field effect in reproducing the correct ( experimentally observed ) composition - dependence of @xmath35 in this alloy system .",

    "this is also reflected in the concentration - dependence of @xmath5 , namely a similar increase of @xmath5 under pressure over the whole concentration range .",
    "the monotonic and essentially linear concentration - dependence of @xmath5 under pressure reflects a similar trend of exchange interactions found for the case of ambient pressure ( see ref .  ) .",

    "however , both lsda and lsda+u reveal the same general trend .",
    "specifically , we observe two concentration regions , the first one for @xmath490.4 in which @xmath5 is essentially constant with a shallow minimum and that for @xmath500.4 where @xmath5 increases monotonically with @xmath51",
    ". with increasing pressure the behavior in the first concentration region remains unchanged , but there is a gradual reduction of the slope in the other concentration region ( the cu - rich end ) .",
    "such a development is clearly related to opposite trends in the pressure - dependence of @xmath5 in ni@xmath0mnsn and cu@xmath0mnsn , a reduction of @xmath5 with pressure for cu@xmath0mnsn and an increase for ni@xmath0mnsn .",
    "the crossover from the positive derivative of the pressure - dependence of @xmath5 to the negative one takes place around @xmath51=0.7 .",
    "thus , for the pressure corresponding to a 3% reduction of the lattice constant we predict only a weak dependence of @xmath52 on the alloy composition .      in this subsection we will present a qualitative understanding of the composition - dependence of @xmath35 at ambient pressure as well as the effect of pressure on @xmath5 using the idea of anderson s superexchange @xcite interaction and stearns @xcite model of the indirect ( rkky - type ) interaction in ferromagnetic heusler alloys .",
    "the mn - mn exchange interaction , as in most other cases , can be divided into three groups : direct , indirect and superexchange . because the mn - atoms are not the nearest neighbors of themselves and have a large separation ( @xmath53 ) , the direct interaction is not of any importance in heusler alloys .",
    "the most important interaction turns out to be the rkky - type indirect interaction@xcite .",
    "of somewhat minor importance is the superexchange interaction , introduced in a series of papers by anderson@xcite .",
    "superexchange , which is also an indirect interaction , is antiferromagnetic , while the rkky - type interaction can be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic .",
    "sasioglu @xcite recently used these two interactions to interpret the results for some heusler alloys .",
    "superexchange is related to possible transitions from occupied states at the fermi level @xmath27 to unoccupied levels above , in the present case to the unoccupied minority mn - bands . because the superexchange interaction is negative , the stronger the superexchange part , the smaller is the total exchange integral ( and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the strength of the superexchange interaction depends on the density of states ( dos ) at @xmath27 and the energy separation between @xmath27 and the unoccupied mn - bands",
    ". the larger the dos at @xmath27 and/or the smaller the above energy separation , the stronger is the superexchange .",
    "this lends a qualitative understanding of the increase of @xmath5 from pd@xmath0mnsn to ni@xmath0mnsn to cu@xmath0mnsn , if the dos mechanism dominates over the decreasing of energy separation in the above sequence of alloys ( fig.2 of ref .  ) .",
    "if we dope the ni - sublattices with cu - atoms in the ni@xmath0mnsn host , the observed hockey - stick - like composition - dependence of @xmath35 can be understood as a competition of above two effects : for low cu - content the decrease of @xmath5 with increasing cu - concentration is due to reduction of the above energy separation , causing an increase of the superexchange part of the interaction . for @xmath54",
    "the dos - effect starts to dominate , with decreasing dos at @xmath27 and thus smaller superexchange and larger total exchange interaction .",
    "this leads to higher @xmath5 of cu@xmath0mnsn as compared to ni@xmath0mnsn .    in ( ni , pd)@xmath0mnsn alloy the dos - effect is the only important effect over the entire concentration range . because the ni- and pd - atoms have the same valency , the above mentioned energy separation does not change with concentration .",
    "there is a small decrease in the dos at @xmath27 in pd@xmath0mnsn compared with ni@xmath0mnsn ( fig.2 of ref .  ) , decreasing the superexchange and increasing @xmath5 .    as mentioned above ,",
    "although the superexchange mechanism seems to support the observed results , it can not be the driving mechanism for the heusler alloys under study .",
    "this is because of relatively large separation of the unoccupied minority mn - peak above @xmath27 ( the mn - dos just above @xmath27 is small ) . of much - larger importance",
    "is the indirect interaction and its key feature in ferromagnetic heusler alloys was captured and successfully described by stearns@xcite in a series of papers in the late seventies .",
    "stearns asserts that the magnetism of heusler alloys ( as well as bcc fe@xcite  ) can be understood by dividing the @xmath3-electrons into localized @xmath3-electrons ( @xmath55 ) associated with narrow @xmath3-subbands and itinerant @xmath3-electrons ( @xmath56 ) associated with ( usually ) one broader @xmath3-subband .",
    "the interaction between these localized and itinerant @xmath3-electrons is similar in nature to rkky interaction , originally formulated for the interaction between localized moments in a free electron gas .",
    "the @xmath3-band gets narrower across ( with increasing number of electrons ) a given series and broader with increasing row number ( e.g. from @xmath57 to @xmath58 ) .",
    "thus stearns used her model to describe correctly the change of @xmath35 from ni@xmath7mnsn to cu@xmath7mnsn ( an increase in @xmath55 causing a rise of @xmath35 ) and from ni@xmath7mnsn to pd@xmath7mnsn ( a decrease of @xmath35 due to decreasing @xmath55 ) .",
    "uhl@xcite used stearns model to explain the hockey - stick appearance of the composition - dependence of @xmath35 with increasing @xmath51 in ( ni@xmath1,cu@xmath46)@xmath0mnsn heusler alloys . with increasing cu - concentration , the lattice dilates .",
    "initially , this dilation causes a reduction in the strength of the @xmath56-@xmath55 interaction , associated with increased mn - mn distance .",
    "however , the addition of cu also causes an increase in the number of @xmath55 and thus in the @xmath56-@xmath55 interaction .",
    "the resulting @xmath35 thus shows an initial decrease followed subsequently by an increase ( for further details , see uhl  @xcite  ) .",
    "thus both superexchange and indirect @xmath56-@xmath55 exchange interaction give rise to the same trend for the composition - dependence of @xmath35 .",
    "the pressure effect on @xmath35 can be understood in the light of the above explanation for the composition - dependence at ambient pressure .",
    "pressure reduces the lattice parameter , an effect opposite to the dilation caused by cu - addition .",
    "pressure also broadens bands , reducing @xmath55 and increasing @xmath56 , again opposite to what happens with increasing cu - content .",
    "thus on the ni - rich side increased pressure increases @xmath35 ( opposite to the result with cu - addition ) , and beyond a certain critical cu - concentration increasing pressure results in decreasing @xmath35 ( opposite to the result with cu - addition ) .",
    "similar reasoning explains the composition - dependence of ambient pressure @xmath35 and the pressure - dependence of @xmath35 in ( ni@xmath1,pd@xmath46)@xmath0mnsn alloys . doping ni - sublattice with pd - atoms results in dilation of the lattice .",
    "in addition , d - electrons in pd are more delocalized than in ni",
    ". both of these will lead to a decrease of @xmath35 with increasing pd concentration .",
    "pressure , via contraction of the lattice , reverses this effect .",
    "it appears that in this case the increasing strength of the interaction due to reduction in the mn - mn distance supersedes the effect of the pressure - induced delocalization of the electrons .",
    "a couple of comments are in order .",
    "stearns model is applicable to only ferromagnetic heusler alloys .",
    "in several semi - heusler alloys , or in general in situations where the superexchange part of the interaction becomes important , stearns model may fail to predict the results correctly",
    ". it would not be incorrect to point out that without an accurate first - principles study as presented here , it would be almost impossible to capture theoretically the details of the composition- or pressure - dependence of @xmath35 , although some qualitative understanding ( especially , _ a posteriori _ ) is possible . in this sense",
    "the importance of first - principles studies like the present one is irrefutable .      in magnetic alloys",
    "there are three contributions to the resistivity : a temperature - independent residual resistivity due to the alloy disorder and other defects , and two temperature - dependent contributions , one due to electron - phonon and the other due to electron - magnon scatterings . in the present case ,",
    "the residual resistivity is small because the states corresponding to ni- , cu- , and pd - atoms are well below the alloy fermi energy , @xcite and thus influence states at the fermi energy ( relevant for residual resistivity ) only weakly . the contribution due to phonons is well understood , and for heusler alloys around room temperature , @xcite this contribution is known to be small .",
    "the dominant contribution is thus due to spin - disorder .",
    "@xcite the spin - disorder induced resistivity is controlled by the spin - spin correlation function which is small at and above @xmath5 , so that a reasonable representation of the situation is given by the dlm state , as explained in detail elsewhere .",
    "@xcite kasuya s @xmath59-@xmath3 interaction model@xcite shows that the temperature - dependence of spin - disorder resistivity is primarily quadratic and can be well - simulated by the @xmath60-law . in the present case",
    "we determine the constant @xmath61 from first principles using @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is identified with the resistivity of the dlm state .",
    "the dlm state is described in the framework of the cpa as an equiconcentration alloy with two types of mn atoms ( a and b ) with their moments pointing randomly up or down ( collinear disorder ) .",
    "the corresponding resistivity can be properly calculated by the kubo - greenwood formula applied to this binary - mn alloy .",

    "it should be noted that the residual resistivity of the ( ni@xmath64,pd@xmath64)mnsn alloy in the ferromagnetic state is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the dlm state .",
    "@xcite    the spin - disorder part of the resistivity is controlled by the constant @xmath61 . for the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , @xmath5 increases under pressure .",
    "due to band - broadening under pressure and accompanying delocalization of the electrons , @xmath68 decreases in general for a given @xmath69 less than the ambient pressure @xmath35 .",
    "however , @xmath63 ( as well as @xmath68 for @xmath70 ambient pressure @xmath35 ) is higher under pressure because of the increase in @xmath35 .    to our knowledge , there are no available experimental results for the systems studied in this paper , although the results of austin and mishra @xcite for related pd@xmath0mnsb heusler alloy do indicate , as in this work as well , an increase of the resistivity under pressure for temperatures above @xmath5 .",
    "undoubtedly pressure has non - negligible influence on the part of the resistivity due to phonons .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "we have studied magnetic and transport properties of quaternary heusler alloys ( ni , t)@xmath0mnsn ( t = cu , pd ) under pressure by means of the first - principles density functional method .",
    "in particular , we have investigated in detail the pressure - dependence of the curie temperature . in agreement with experiments ,",
    "we obtain an increase of the curie temperature under pressure ( reduction of the lattice constant ) for ni@xmath0mnsn and pd@xmath0mnsn . on the other hand ,",
    "cu@xmath0mnsn alloy exhibits a reduction of the curie temperature with applied pressure .",
    "the results can be qualitatively understood as an interplay of two effects : an increase of the bare exchange integrals with the volume reduction and the decrease of magnetic moments with pressure due to band broadening .",
    "the concentration - dependence of the curie temperature under pressure is simple in ( ni , pd)@xmath0mnsn heusler alloys where the increase of the curie temperature has an almost constant slope . on the other hand ,",
    "we predict a dramatic change of the curie temperature with pressure from the positive for ni - rich ( ni , pd)@xmath0mnsn alloys to a negative one in cu - rich alloys , the crossover being around 70  % of cu .",
    "we emphasize that such a complex behavior can not be obtained without an accurate calculation of the exchange interaction and a proper statistical treatment to compute @xmath35 ( i.e. , by going beyond the mfa ) .    a simple explanation of the behavior of the calculated @xmath5 under pressure is given in the framework of anderson s superexchange interaction and the stearns model of the indirect exchange interaction between itinerant and localized @xmath3-electrons .",
    "we have also investigated the pressure - dependence of the spin - disorder related part of the resistivity , which dominates at higher temperatures , the residual resistivity due to alloy disorder being small and important only for very low temperatures .",
    "we have found that the resistivity at the curie temperature increases with pressure , but this result is due to the increase of the curie temperature with pressure itself . for temperatures below the ambient pressure",
