    "since pioneering experiments measuring inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) signals  @xcite , intense efforts have been made to understand inelastic transport properties when conducting electrons interact with local vibrations  @xcite .",
    "the iets signals are identified as steps in the differential conductance at a threshold bias voltage equal to a vibrational energy  @xcite .",
    "the same steps also appear in the voltage derivative of the shot noise  @xcite .",
    "these steps indicate opening of inelastic transport channels , where electrons can pass through the junction by losing energy .    it is known that the conductance variation undergoes a crossover from an increase to a decrease when a bare transmission @xmath0 evolves from zero to one  @xcite .",
    "the similar crossover behavior in the shot noise has been reported in a recent experiment of the shot noise measurement  @xcite . in ref .  , it is observed that inelastic noise corrections are negative when a measured zero - bias conductance is approximately below @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , the noise corrections are exclusively positive for the zero - bias conductance close to @xmath2 .    to understand this crossover ,",
    "several model systems have been theoretically investigated  @xcite .",
    "the representative system is a single - level model with a single vibrating scatterer  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the conductance crossover occurs when @xmath3 for the single level symmetrically connected to single - channel electrodes  @xcite .",
    "considering the current noise , the single - level model symmetrically coupled to electrodes exhibits two crossovers in the inelastic noise correction at @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "reference   studied a two - site tight - binding model symmetrically connected to electrodes in order to analyze density functional theory ( dft ) calculations on inelastic signals of au atomic point contacts . for the out - of - phase longitudinal vibrational mode that gives a dominant contribution to inelastic signals",
    ", it is found that the two - site model exhibits the crossover in the conductance at @xmath3 and the noise signal crossover at @xmath4 , as the symmetric single - level model does  @xcite .",
    "although these simple models can give some qualitative hint on understanding the inelastic shot noise , it has not yet been clearly understood why the models exhibit the same crossover behaviors .",
    "furthermore , performing dft calculations for a variety of au atomic chains , ref .",
    "calculated the ratios of the steps in the inelastic noise signal to the conductance changes for the chains , and compared them with the ratio of the two - site model .",
    "reference   concluded that the ratio predicted by the two - site model might be an upper bound to those of the atomic chains .",
    "however , there is no theoretical justification for why the two - site model , which is originally designed to study atomic point contacts , can provide an upper bound to the computed ratios of the atomic chains varying in configurations and lengths .",
    "thus , it is needed to find out a general picture that can explain the aforementioned issues .",
    "recently we presented a scattering - state description of inelastic electron transport in a weak electron - vibration ( el - vib ) coupling regime , which is established by converting non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) to scattering states  @xcite . in this description , we clarified elastic and inelastic contributions to conductance variations in terms of eigenchannel scattering states and associated scattering matrices .",
    "doing so , we obtained a general expression for the conductance jump of single - channel systems .",
    "while the inelastic contribution is proportional to @xmath5 , the elastic one is always negative .",
    "it leads to conclusion that the conductance crossover can generally occur below @xmath3 for single - channel systems .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our scattering theory approach to the inelastic current noise , especially in order to unveil an unified picture that can comprehensively explain the existing results in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we specify elastic and inelastic contributions to the current noise by examining charge transfers between scattering states and energy exchange between electrons and vibrations .",
    "different from the conductance , such contributions to the current noise can be further decomposed into current correlations of electrons at the same energy and those of electrons at different energies . considering single - channel systems ,",
    "we show that the crossover for the inelastic noise signal can occur in two ranges of transmissions , _ i.e. _ , between @xmath6 and @xmath7 or between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , for mirror - symmetric junctions , even parity vibrational modes lead to two crossovers of the noise correction at @xmath4 , while there is only one crossover at @xmath3 for odd parity modes .",
    "when @xmath0 is close to one , our scattering - state description shows that the ratios of noise correction steps to conductance changes for odd and even parity modes are lower and upper bounds for those of general cases , respectively .",

    "second , we explain the scattering - state description of the inelastic noise correction , focusing on identification of scattering processes in the noise correction . in sec",
    ".  [ discussion ] , we apply our theory to single - channel systems . here",
    "we discuss the crossover of the noise correction in general situations including the systems investigated in the literature  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] , we make a final conclusion . technical details and derivations are discussed in appendixes  [ derivation ] and [ multichannel_systems ] .",
    "before presenting our scattering - theory description for the shot noise , we first discuss the competition between elastic and inelastic scattering processes in a general perspective  @xcite . here",
    "we define that electron transport is elastic ( inelastic ) if the total energy of conducting electrons is conserved ( not conserved ) after electrons pass through the vibrating region . in ref .",
    ", we clarified elastic and inelastic scattering contributions to the current in the second order of el - vib couplings , and used their interplay to explain the conductance crossover .",
    "in fact , the competition between elastic and inelastic scattering processes is not limited only to the current correction  @xcite , but it is generally respected in other transport properties such as the current noise  @xcite . when a zero temperature regime is considered for simplicity",
    ", a many - body state of electrons and vibrons perturbed by el - vib interactions can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a ground state of no el - vib coupling at zero temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote electronic and vibronic ground states respectively .",
    "note that the vibronic state @xmath15 represents that there are @xmath16 vibrons excited .",
    "@xmath17 is a perturbed state in the @xmath16th order of el - vib couplings .",

    "two cases are possible : the first case is that electrons regain the vibronic energy quantum from vibrations , and the other is that electrons emit another vibron .",

    "<S> we present a scattering theory description for the inelastic current noise in the presence of electron - vibration interactions . in this description , we specify elastic and inelastic scattering contributions to the shot noise by examining charge transfers between scattering states and energy exchange between electrons and vibrations . the elastic and inelastic scattering processes are further decomposed into current correlations of electrons at the same energy and those of electrons at different energies . focusing on the inelastic noise signals defined as steps in the voltage derivative of the shot noise , we show that single - channel systems have two ranges of transmission at which the inelastic noise signals exhibit the crossover between positive and negative signs . in a high transmission regime , </S>",
    "<S> even and odd vibrational modes of mirror - symmetric systems provide upper and lower bounds to the ratio of the inelastic noise signal to the conductance step . </S>",
