    "the construction of tests for hypotheses on the coefficient vector in linear regression models with dependent errors is highly practically relevant and has received lots of attention in the statistics and econometrics literature .",
    "the main challenge is to obtain tests with good size and power properties in situations where the nuisance parameter governing the dependence structure of the errors is high- or possibly infinite - dimensional and allows for strong correlations .",
    "the large majority of available procedures are autocorrelation - corrected f - type tests , based on nonparametric covariance estimators trying to take into account the autocorrelation in the disturbances .",
    "these tests can roughly be categorized into two groups , the distinction depending on the choice of a bandwidth parameter in the construction of the covariance estimator .",
    "the first group of such tests , so - called ` hac tests ' , incorporates bandwidth parameters that lead to consistent covariance estimators , and to an asymptotic @xmath0-distribution of the corresponding test statistics under the null hypothesis , the quantiles of which are used for testing . concerning ` hac tests ' , important contributions in the econometrics literature are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it is safe to say that the covariance estimators introduced in the latter two articles currently constitute the gold standard for obtaining ` hac tests ' .",
    "in contrast to the estimator suggested earlier by @xcite - structurally @xmath1 times a standard kernel spectral density estimator ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite section 7.9 ) evaluated at frequency @xmath2 - the covariance estimators suggested in @xcite and @xcite both incorporate an additional prewhitening step based on an auxiliary vector autoregressive ( var ) model , as well as a data - dependent bandwidth parameter . a distinguishing feature of the estimators introduced by @xcite on the one hand and @xcite on the other hand is the choice of the bandwidth parameter : @xcite used an approach introduced by @xcite , where the bandwidth parameter is chosen based on auxiliary parametric models .",
    "in contrast to that , @xcite suggested a nonparametric approach for choosing the bandwidth parameter . even though simulation studies have shown",
    "that the inclusion of a prewhitening step and the data - dependent choice of the bandwidth parameter can improve the finite sample properties of ` hac tests ' , the more sophisticated ` hac tests ' so obtained still suffer from size distortions and power deficiencies .",
    "for this reason @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggested to choose the bandwidth parameter as a fixed proportion of the sample size .",
    "this framework leads to an inconsistent covariance estimator and to a non - standard limiting distribution of the corresponding test statistic under the null , the quantiles of which are used to obtain so called ` fixed - b tests ' . in simulation studies it has been observed that ` fixed - b tests ' still suffer from size distortions in finite samples , but less so than ` hac tests ' . however , this is at the expense of some loss in power .",
    "similar as in ` hac testing ' simulation results in @xcite and @xcite suggest that the finite sample properties of ` fixed - b tests ' can be improved by incorporating a prewhitening step . in the latter paper",
    "it was furthermore shown that the asymptotic distribution under the null of the test suggested by @xcite is the same whether or not prewhitening is used .    a number of recent studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) tried to use higher order expansions to uncover the mechanism leading to size distortions and power deficiencies of ` hac tests ' and ` fixed - b tests ' . these higher - order asymptotic results ( and also the first - order results discussed above )",
    "are pointwise in the sense that they are obtained under the assumption of a fixed underlying data - generating - process .",
    "hence , while they inform us about the limit of the rejection probability and the rate of convergence to this limit for a fixed underlying data - generating - process , they do not inform us about the _ size _ of the test or its limit as sample size increases , nor about the _ power function _ or its asymptotic behavior .",
    "size and power properties of tests in regression models with dependent errors were recently studied in @xcite : in a general finite sample setup and under high - level conditions on the structure of the test and the covariance model , they derived conditions on the design matrix under which a concentration mechanism due to strong dependencies leads to extreme size distortions or power deficiencies .",
    "furthermore , they suggested an adjustment - procedure to obtain a modified test with improved size and power properties .",
    "specializing their general theory to a covariance model that includes at least all covariance matrices corresponding to stationary autoregressive processes of order one ( ar(1 ) ) , they investigated finite sample properties of ` hac tests ' and ` fixed - b tests ' based on _ non - prewhitened _ covariance estimators with _ data - independent _ bandwidth parameters ( covering _ inter alia _ the procedures in @xcite , sections 3 - 5 of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , but _ not _ the methods considered by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "in this setup @xcite demonstrated that these tests break down in terms of their size or power behavior for generic design matrices . despite this negative result",
    ", they also showed that the adjustment procedure can often solve these problems , if elements of the covariance model which are close to being singular can be well approximated by ar(1 ) covariance matrices .",
    "@xcite did not consider tests based on prewhitened covariance estimators or data - dependent bandwidth parameters .",
    "therefore the question remains , whether the more sophisticated ` hac tests ' typically used in practice ( i.e. , tests based on the estimators by @xcite or @xcite ) and the prewhitened ` fixed - b tests ' ( i.e. , tests as considered in @xcite ) also suffer from extreme size distortions and power deficiencies , or if prewhitening and the use of data - dependent bandwidth parameters can indeed resolve or at least substantially alleviate these problems . in the present paper we investigate finite sample properties of tests based on prewhitened covariance estimators or data - dependent bandwidth parameters .",
    "in particular our analysis covers tests based on prewhitened covariance estimators using auxiliary ar(1 ) models for the construction of the bandwidth parameter as discussed in @xcite , tests based on prewhitened covariance estimators as discussed in @xcite , and prewhitened ` fixed - b ' tests as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we show that the tests considered , albeit being structurally much more complex , exhibit a similar behavior as their _ non - prewhitened _ counterparts with _ data - independent _ bandwidth parameters : first , we establish conditions on the design matrix under which the tests considered have ( i ) size equal to one , or ( ii ) size not smaller than one half , or ( iii ) nuisance - minimal power equal to zero , respectively .",
    "we then demonstrate that at least one of these conditions is generically satisfied , showing that the tests considered break down for generic design matrices .",
    "motivated by this negative result , we introduce an adjustment procedure . under the assumption that elements of the covariance model which are close to being singular can be well approximated by ar(1 ) covariance matrices , we show that the adjustment procedure , if applicable , leads to tests that do not suffer from extreme size distortions or power deficiencies .",
    "finally , it is shown that the adjustment procedure is applicable under generic conditions on the design matrix , unless the regression includes the intercept _ and _ the hypothesis to be tested restricts the corresponding coefficient . on a technical level",
    "we employ the general theory developed in @xcite .",
    "we remark , however , that the genericity results in particular do not follow from this general theory .",
    "rather they are obtained by carefully exploiting the specific structure of the procedures under consideration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the framework is introduced in section [ framework ] . in section [ tpwc ]",
    "we introduce the test statistics , covariance estimators , and bandwidth parameters we analyze . in section [ neg ]",
    "we establish our negative result and its genericity . in section [ pos ]",
    "we discuss the adjustment - procedure and its generic applicability .",
    "section [ concl ] concludes .",
    "the proofs are collected in appendices [ aa]-[ad ] .",
    "consider the linear regression model @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a ( real ) @xmath5 dimensional non - stochastic design matrix satisfying @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here",
    ", @xmath9 denotes the unknown regression parameter vector , and the disturbance vector @xmath10 is gaussian , has mean zero and its unknown covariance matrix is given by @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 satisfies @xmath13 and @xmath14 is assumed to be an element of a prescribed ( non - void ) set of positive definite and symmetric @xmath15 matrices @xmath16 , which we shall refer to as the _ covariance model_. throughout we impose the assumption on @xmath16 that the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath14 can be uniquely determined from @xmath11 .",
    "[ stationary ] the leading case we have in mind is the situation where @xmath17 are @xmath18 consecutive elements of a weakly stationary process . in such a setup a covariance model",
    "is typically obtained from a prescribed ( non - void ) set of spectral densities @xmath19 . assuming that no element of @xmath19 vanishes identically almost everywhere , the covariance model corresponding to @xmath19 is then given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 and where @xmath22 denotes the imaginary unit .",
    "every such @xmath23 is positive definite and symmetric .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath23 is a correlation matrix , @xmath12 and @xmath23 can uniquely be determined from @xmath24 . as outlined in the introduction the tests we shall investigate in this paper",
    "are particularly geared towards setups where @xmath19 is a nonparametric class of spectral densities , i.e. , where the corresponding set @xmath25 is rich .",
    "a typical example is the class @xmath26 , which consists of all spectral densities of linear processes the coefficients of which satisfy a certain summability condition , i.e. , spectral densities of the form @xmath27 where , for a fixed @xmath28 , the summability condition @xmath29 is satisfied .",
    "we observe that @xmath30 contains in particular all correlation matrices corresponding to spectral densities of stationary autoregressive moving average models of arbitrary large order .    the linear model described in",
    "induces a collection of distributions on @xmath31 , the sample space of @xmath32 . denoting a gaussian probability measure with mean @xmath33 and covariance matrix @xmath34 by @xmath35 and denoting the regression manifold by @xmath36 , the induced collection of distributions",
    "is given by @xmath37 since every @xmath38 is positive definite by definition , each element @xmath35 of the set in the previous display is absolutely continuous with respect to ( w.r.t . )",
    "lebesgue measure on @xmath39 .    in this setup",
    "we shall consider the problem of testing a linear hypothesis on the parameter vector @xmath9 , i.e. , the problem of testing the null @xmath40 against the alternative @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a @xmath43 matrix of rank @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "define the affine space @xmath46 and let @xmath47 adopting these definitions , the above testing problem can be written as @xmath48 where it is emphasized that the testing problem is a compound one .",
    "it is immediately clear that size and power properties of tests in this setup depend in a crucial way on the richness of the covariance model @xmath16 .",
    "before we close this section by introducing some further terminological and notational conventions , some comments on how the above assumptions can be relaxed are in order : we remark that even though our setup assumes a non - stochastic design matrix , the results immediately carry over to a setting where the data generating processes of the design and the disturbances are independent of each other .",
    "in such a setup our results deliver size and power properties conditional on the design .",
    "the gaussianity assumption might seem to be restrictive .",
    "however , as in section 5.5 of @xcite , we mention that the negative results given in section [ neg ] of the present paper immediately extend in a trivial way without imposing the gaussianity assumption on the error vector @xmath49 in , as long as the assumptions on the feasible error distributions are weak enough to ensure that the implied set of distributions for @xmath32 contains the set in equation , but possibly contains also other distributions .",
    "furthermore , by applying an invariance argument ( explained in @xcite section 5.5 ) one can easily show that all statements about the null - behavior of the procedures under consideration derived in the present paper carry over to the more general distributional setup where @xmath49 is assumed to be elliptically distributed .",
    "this is to be understood as @xmath49 having the same distribution as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , @xmath38 , @xmath52 is a random vector uniformly distributed on the unit sphere @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is a random variable distributed independently of @xmath52 and which is positive with probability one .",

    "in the present section we formally describe the construction of tests based on prewhitened covariance estimators .",

    "such an estimator is completely specified by three core ingredients : first , a _ kernel _ @xmath103 , i.e. , an even function satisfying @xmath104 , such as , e.g. , the bartlett or parzen kernel ; second , a ( non - negative ) possibly data - dependent _ bandwidth parameter _ @xmath105 ; and third , a deterministic _ prewhitening order _",

    "hence the covariance estimator would nowhere be well defined for such a choice , because ( i ) in remark [ wdpsi ] would then clearly be violated at every observation @xmath109 .    [ varols ] in the present paper we focus on var prewhitening based on the ols estimator .",
    "this is in line with the original suggestions by @xcite , as well as with @xcite .",
    "alternatively , for @xmath137 , @xcite suggested to use an eigenvalue adjusted version of the ols estimator , the adjustment being applied if the matrix @xmath138 is close to being singular .",
    "we shall focus on the unadjusted ols estimator for the following reasons : @xcite reported that the finite sample properties show little sensitivity to this eigenvalue adjustment .",
    "furthermore , it is the unadjusted estimator that is often used in implementations of the method suggested by @xcite in software packages for statistical and econometric computing ( e.g. , its implementation in the ` r ` package ` sandwich ` by @xcite , or its implementation in ` eviews ` , e.g. , @xcite , p. 784 . ) .",
    "we remark , however , that one can obtain a negative result similar to theorem [ thmlrvpw ] , and a positive result concerning an adjustment procedure similar to theorem [ tu_3 ] , also for tests based on prewhitened estimators with eigenvalue adjustment .",
    "furthermore , we conjecture that it is possible to prove ( similar to proposition [ generic ] ) the genericity of such a negative result , and to show that one can ( similar to proposition [ genericadj ] ) generically resolve this problem by using the adjustment procedure .",
    "we leave the question of which estimator to choose for prewhitening to future research .    in a typical asymptotic analysis of tests based on",
    "prewhitened covariance estimators the event @xmath139 is asymptotically negligible ( since @xmath101 converges to a positive definite , or almost everywhere positive definite matrix ) .",
    "hence there is no need to be specific about the definition of the test statistic for @xmath140 , and one can work directly with the statistic @xmath141 which is left undefined for @xmath140 . in a finite sample setup , however , one has to think about the definition of the test statistic also for @xmath140 . our decision to assign the value @xmath2 to the test statistic for @xmath140 is of course completely arbitrary . that this assignment does not affect our results",
    "at all is discussed in detail in the following remark .",
    "[ rdef ] given that the estimator @xmath101 is based on a triple @xmath108 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 that satisfies assumption [ weightspwrb ] introduced below ( which is assumed in all of our main results , and which is satisfied for covariance estimators using auxiliary ar(1 ) models for the construction of the bandwidth parameter as considered in @xcite , for covariance estimators as considered in @xcite , and for covariance estimators as considered in @xcite ) , it follows from lemma [ n*pw ] that @xmath139 is either a @xmath142-null set , or that it coincides with @xmath143 . in the first case , which is generic under weak dimensionality constraints",
    "as shown in lemma [ nulln*pw ] , the definition of the test statistic on @xmath139 does hence not influence the rejection probabilities , because our model is dominated by @xmath142 ( @xmath16 contains only positive definite matrices ) .",
    "therefore , size and power properties are not affected by the definition of the test statistic for @xmath140 .",
    "in the second case , i.e. , if @xmath139 coincides with @xmath143 , the statistic in is nowhere well defined , and hence , regardless of which value is assigned to it for observations @xmath140 , the resulting test statistic is constant , and thus the test breaks down trivially .      in the following we describe bandwidth parameters @xmath105",
    "that are typically used in step 2 in the construction of the prewhitened estimator @xmath100 as discussed above : the parametric approach ( based on auxiliary ar(1 ) models ) suggested by @xcite and @xcite , the nonparametric approach introduced by @xcite , and a data - independent approach which was already investigated in @xcite in simulation studies and which has recently been theoretically investigated by @xcite .",
    "since the bandwidth parameter @xmath105 is computed in step 2 in the construction of @xmath110 , we assume that @xmath108 , @xmath106 and @xmath109 are given and that step 1 has already been successfully completed , i.e. , all operations in step 1 are well defined at @xmath109 , in particular @xmath144 is available for the construction of @xmath105 . if not , we leave the bandwidth parameter ( and hence the covariance estimator ) undefined at @xmath109 .",
    "we also implicitly assume that the quantities and operations appearing in the procedures outlined subsequently are well defined and leave the bandwidth parameter ( and hence the covariance estimator ) undefined else .",
    "a detailed structural analysis of the subset of the sample space where a prewhitened estimator @xmath101 is well defined is then later given in lemma [ npwrb ] in section [ struct ] . finally , we emphasize that the bandwidth parameters discussed subsequently all require the choice of additional tuning parameters .",
    "these tuning parameters are typically chosen independently of @xmath109 and @xmath4 , an assumption we shall maintain throughout the whole paper ( but see remark [ rtuning ] for some generalizations ) .",
    "let @xmath145 be such that @xmath146 and @xmath147 for @xmath148 , i.e. , @xmath149 is a _",

    "then , one calculates @xmath154 finally , bandwidth parameters are obtained via @xmath155 where to obtain a bandwidth parameter , one has to fix the constants @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath73 and where @xmath158 .",
    "typically the choice of these constants and the choice of @xmath73 depends on certain characteristics of @xmath108 ( for specific choices see @xcite , section 6 , in particular p. 834 ) . for example , if @xmath108 is the bartlett kernel one uses @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , or if @xmath108 is the quadratic - spectral kernel one would use @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "since we do not need such a specific dependence to derive our theoretical results , we do not impose any further assumptions on these constants beyond being positive ( and independent of @xmath109 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath165 the set of all bandwidth parameters that can be obtained as special cases of the method in the present section , by appropriately choosing - functionally independently of @xmath109 and @xmath4 - a weights vector @xmath149 , constants @xmath156 , @xmath157 and a @xmath166 .",
    "since @xmath18 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 are fixed quantities , the tuning parameters @xmath149 , @xmath169 for @xmath170 and @xmath73 might also depend on them , although we do not signify this in our notation .",
    "a similar remark applies to the constants appearing in section [ mnw94 ] and in section [ mr ] .",
