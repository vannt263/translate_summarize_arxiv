    "the problem of dark energy has become one of the most important issues of the modern cosmology since the observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite first indicated that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion at the present stage ( if assuming that the universe is described by the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model ) .",
    "many cosmologists believe that the identity of dark energy is the cosmological constant which fits the observational data very well . however , one still has reasons to dislike the cosmological constant since it suffers from the theoretical problems such as the `` fine - tuning '' and the `` cosmic coincidence '' puzzles @xcite .",
    "thus , a variety of proposals for dynamic dark energy have emerged .",
    "for example , the  scalar field \" model @xcite has been explored for a long time . besides , the  holographic dark energy \" models @xcite , which arise from the holographic principle of quantum gravity theory , has also attracted much attention .",
    "there are also some other theoretical approaches to explain the current cosmic acceleration .",
    "for example , it is argued that the acceleration of the universe may signify the breakdown of einstein s theory of general relativity @xcite .",
    "another interesting idea @xcite is based on the assumption that the universe is described by the spherically symmetric , inhomogeneous lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) metric @xcite @xcite @xcite . recently , some authors further proposed a possibility of mimicking the cosmological constant in an inhomogeneous universe @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the idea is that , since cosmological observations are limited on the light cone , it is possible to reconstruct an inhomogeneous cosmological model ( indistinguishable from the homogeneous @xmath0cdm model ) to explain the cosmic acceleration without a cosmological constant .",
    "the formalism of reconstruction was developed in @xcite and was applied to the @xmath0cdm model in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors constructed a spherically symmetric , inhomogeneous cosmological model reproducing the luminosity - distance and the light - cone mass density of @xmath0cdm model up to @xmath3 .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the reconstructed inhomogeneous cosmological model and investigate whether it is consistent with cosmological observations .",
    "since in this model @xmath0cdm observations are exactly reconstructed on the light - cone , we should seek for some observational test _ not limited on the light - cone _ to distinguish it from the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "fortunately , we find that the age of the universe is an appropriate touchstone .",
    "the cosmic age , which depends on the evolution of the universe at a comoving position , contains information not limited on the light - cone ( the age is uniform in the @xmath0cdm model but may be dependent on the position in an inhomogeneous cosmological model ) .",
    "thus it may reveal the discrepancies between the @xmath0cdm model and the reconstructed inhomogeneous model . on the other hand ,",
    "it is rather convenient to use the cosmic age to test the validity of a specific cosmological model . to do this",
    "one may just compare the result with the age of some old objects in our universe @xcite .",
    "for example , to be consistent the age of our universe in our position must not be younger than the age of the oldest stellar in the milky way .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ltb ] , following the procedure of @xcite , we introduce the inhomogeneous ltb model and explain how to reconstruct @xmath0cdm observations in this model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosmicage ] , we calculate the cosmic age at our position and compare the result with the age of some old objects .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , following the procedure of @xcite , we explain how to reconstruct an inhomogeneous ltb model having the same luminosity distance and light - cone mass density of the homogeneous @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the ltb models are spherically symmetric cosmological solutions to the einstein equations with a dust stress - energy tensor .",
    "the general metric for the ltb models in a synchronous comoving coordinate takes the form , @xmath4 following @xcite , we use the prime superscript to denote @xmath5 , and the overdot to denote @xmath6 . noticing that here @xmath7 is a dimensionless coordinate , while @xmath8 has the dimension of length .",
    "the robertson - walker metric can be recovered after performing @xmath9 and @xmath10 . solving the einstein equations one obtains the generalized  friedmann equations \" for @xmath8 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 and the photon radial null geodesic equation for @xmath14",
    "is found directly from the ltb metric ( we are only interested in the past light cone ) , @xmath15 for convenence we denote quantities on the light cone by a hat .",
    "thus we have , @xmath16 then let us focus on the reconstruction procedures .",
    "the method was discussed by mustapha , hellaby , and ellis in 1997 @xcite , and was recently applied to the @xmath0cdm model in @xcite @xcite ( a related formalism was developed by @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "following their procedure , we take advantage of a coordinate freedom and rescale @xmath7 so that _ on the light cone _ , @xmath17 the corresponding coordinate transformation is @xmath18 . in the following , for simplicity we will use @xmath7 to denote @xmath19 .",
    "the redshift takes the form ( see sec . 2.3 in @xcite ) @xmath20 following the procedure of @xcite , we reconstruct @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the @xmath0cdm model . to do this",
    "we require that on the light cone , @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for mass density in the @xmath0cdm model , and @xmath25 stands for the hubble constant in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "these quantities take the forms , @xmath26 for simplicity we only consider a flat @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we use the notations , @xmath27 then from eq .",
    "( [ reconstruction ] ) it is straightforward to derive the following expressions , @xmath28 @xmath29 ^ 2 .\\ ] ] furthermore , the following three equations can be obtained by solving the corresponding @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( eqs .",
    "( 19 - 21 ) in @xcite ) @xmath33 @xmath34,\\ ] ] @xmath35 it should be emphasized that for these values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the corresponding ltb model _ exactly reproduces _ the luminosity - distance relation and light - cone mass density of the @xmath0cdm model . for convenience , in the following context we will use  ltb-@xmath0cdm model \" to denote this reconstructed ltb model .",
    "it should be stressed that since the ltb-@xmath0cdm model is reconstructed by mimicking @xmath0cdm model , it has the same luminosity - distance - redshift relation and light - cone mass - density - redshift relation as the homogeneous @xmath0cdm model .",
    "thus when estimating some physical quantities of the ltb-@xmath0cdm model from cosmological measurements one can just use the obtained values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 from the fit of the @xmath0cdm model ( i.e. it is not necessary to impose a special constraint on the ltb-@xmath0cdm model ) .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors just take @xmath40=0.3 to mimicking a flat @xmath0cdm with mass ratio @xmath41 .",
    "in the first subsection , we derive the expression of the cosmic age in the ltb-@xmath0cdm model .",
    "then in the second subsection , we estimate the age from cosmological observations , and compare it with that in the homogeneous @xmath0cdm model .",
    "finally , in the third subsection , we discuss the validity of the ltb-@xmath0cdm model by considering the astronomical measurements of the age of some old objects in our universe .",
    "first of all , we investigate the properties of eqs.([e1]),([e2]),([basiceq.1]-[basiceq.5 ] ) at @xmath42 ( corresponds to our position in the universe ) .",
    "since the function @xmath8 represents the diameter distance , one expects @xmath43 when @xmath7 approaches zero .",
    "so @xmath8 can be expanded near @xmath42 as , @xmath44 then from eq .",
    "( [ basiceq.4 ] ) we obtain @xmath45 from eqs .",
    "( [ lcdmvalue])([basiceq.2])([basiceq.4 ] ) , we expand @xmath46 to the leading order and substitute them into eq .",
    "( [ basiceq.4 ] ) to obtain @xmath47 @xmath48 the calculation of @xmath49 is also straightforward . from eqs.([basiceq.4])([basiceq.5 ] ) it follows that @xmath50 \\big)^2 - 1.\\ ] ] substituting @xmath51 into eq .",
    "( [ beta2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 notice that @xmath53 does not appear in the expression , so we just have to expand @xmath54 to the first order . using eqs.([basiceq.1])([basiceq.3 ] ) , it follows that , @xmath55 combining with eq .",
    "( [ beta2two ] ) we obtain @xmath56 next we calculate the age of the universe ( @xmath57 ) at @xmath42 . from eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) it follows that , @xmath58 where the upper and lower bounds of the integral can be determined by eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , @xmath59 finally , combining the above with eqs.([lcdmvalue])([alpha3 ] ) , we obtain the age of the universe at @xmath42 in the ltb-@xmath0cdm model , @xmath60      next we estimate the cosmic age in the ltb-@xmath0cdm model and compare the result with that of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "these two models are both determined by two parameters , the present matter ratio @xmath40 , and the hubble constant @xmath62 . for convenience ,",
    "let us denote the cosmic age in the ltb-@xmath0cdm model and @xmath0cdm model at @xmath42 as @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we have [ we perform a parameter transformation @xmath65 in @xmath66 @xmath67 the only difference between @xmath68 and @xmath61 lies in the second term in the square root . since @xmath69 ( the upper bound of the integral is @xmath70 ) , it is clearly that @xmath61 is smaller than @xmath68 given the same set of parameters .",
    "notice that @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath71 . to prove",
    "this one can perform a coordinate transformation @xmath72 , which yields that , @xmath73 so we have , @xmath74 clearly , @xmath63 has larger values with smaller values of @xmath40 and @xmath62 parameters .",
    "one can easily verify that the conclusion is the same for @xmath75 .",
    "now we are ready to calculate the specific values of @xmath61 with given values of @xmath62 and @xmath40 . here",
    "we refer to the result of the seven - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations @xcite . from the constraint from",
    " wmap7+bao+@xmath62 \" @xcite@xcite@xcite the wmap collaboration provides the best - fit values of @xmath76 and @xmath62 together with their 1@xmath2 uncertainties , @xmath77 from their result we can put a constraint on @xmath61 and @xmath68 at 1@xmath2 confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "the result is , @xmath78 it is found that @xmath61 is about 2gyr younger than @xmath79 . at the 1@xmath2 cl",
    "we obtain the upper limit of the age of the ltb-@xmath0cdm model @xmath1gyr , with the set of the smallest values of parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81km / s / mpc ( in fact this result is overestimated since we ignore the degeneracy between @xmath40 and @xmath62 .",
    "the upper limit value of @xmath61 should be smaller , or at least as small as 11.7gyr ) .",
    "it should be stressed that to be strict the previous estimation of @xmath82 is not appropriate , since we have assumed that the wmap and baryon acoustic oscillations data could be used to constrain the ltb models .",
    "in fact , the issues of cmb and structure formation in the ltb scenario are rather complicated and have not been clearly investigated . to avoid this problem one can put constraints to @xmath40 and @xmath62 from snia observations .",
    "the recent observations of sdss - ii ( sloan digital sky survey ii)@xcite and hubble space telescope@xcite show that @xmath83km / s / mpc in 1@xmath2 cl . from their result",
    "we find a upper limit @xmath84gyr , which is the similar with our previous result @xmath1gyr .",
    "the low limit to the cosmic age can be directly obtained from estimating the age of some old objects in our universe @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "as an example , based on white dwarf cooling the authors of @xcite get a result of @xmath85gyr . compared with the result of the previous subsection @xmath1gyr",
    "it seems that the ltb-@xmath0cdm model is inconsistent with their measurements .",
    "however , one should not conclude hastily .",
    "the reason is that the result of @xcite is subject to larger uncertainty .",
    "the uncertainty due to calculations of the white dwarf cooling is difficult to estimate , and in their result corresponding errors are not included .",
    "in fact , the authors of @xcite argued that systematic uncertainties are likely to be at least as large as , if not larger than , the quoted statistical errors .",
    "so if indeed the uncertainty due to calculations of the white dwarf cooling is as large as the observational error , then the ltb-@xmath0cdm model is within 1@xmath2 agreement with observations .",
    "the age based on evolution of compact binaries is somewhat lower . in @xcite@xcite",
    "the authors give a result of @xmath86gyr and @xmath87gyr , respectively .",
    "moreover , the oldest known star in the milky way , he 1523 - 0901 , is reported to have an age of 13.2@xmath882.7gyr @xcite , for a lower limit of 10.5gyr .",
    "obviously , these measurements are all in consistent with @xmath61 and @xmath68 obtained with data from @xcite at 1@xmath2 cl . therefore , although the obtained @xmath61 is about 2gyr younger than @xmath68 , it is still in 1@xmath2 agreement with current astronomical observations , and we are not able to argue against the reconstructed ltb-@xmath0cdm model .",
    "we show the situation in fig .",
    "the green and red regions represent parameters with cosmic age older than 11.2gyr in @xmath0cdm and ltb-@xmath0cdm model , respectively .",
    "the black shadow region is a 1@xmath2 cl constraint from the seven - year wmap observations @xcite ( we ignore degeneracy ) .",
    "the blue region is a 2@xmath2 cl constraint from a joint analysis performed in one of our previous works @xcite , in which we used the constitution supernovae sample @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite and the five - year wmap observations @xcite . since current limit to the cosmic age from astronomical measurements generally gives a result @xmath89gyr , we plot the regions of @xmath90gyr ( red shadow ) and @xmath91gyr ( green shadow ) in this figure .",
    "it is obvious that the @xmath0cdm perfectly passes the cosmic age text , while the overlap of the blue region , the black shadow region and the red shadow region implies that the ltb-@xmath0cdm model is also consistent with current observations .",
    "finally , at the end of this section , we stress that in this paper we only consider a particular ltb model - namely , the one with @xmath0cdm features . other inhomogeneous models ( such as the void models )",
    "may have larger age at the origin , and in these cases one would have to seek for other methods to test and identify them .",
    "[ fig1 ]   and @xmath62 plane .",
    "the green and red regions stand for @xmath9211.2gyr and @xmath93 11.2gyr respectively .",
    "the black shadow region represents the 1@xmath2 constraint to @xmath40 and @xmath62 from the seven - year wmap observations ( degeneracy is ignored ) .",
    "the blue region is a 2@xmath2 constraint from a joint analysis from the constitution supernovae sample , baryon acoustic oscillations and the five - year wmap observations .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=464 ]",
    "in this paper we calculate the cosmic age at @xmath42 in the ltb-@xmath0cdm model , which reproduces the luminosity - distance and light - cone matter density of the homogeneous @xmath0cdm model . using the constraints of @xmath40 and @xmath62 from the seven - year wmap observations combined with other cosmological observations , we get the upper limit @xmath1gyr at 1@xmath2 cl .",
    "this result is about 2gyr younger than the cosmic age in @xmath0cdm scenario .",
    "since current astronomical measurements generally put a 1@xmath2 cl lower limit on the age of the universe of about 11.2gyr , the ltb-@xmath0cdm model is still in 1@xmath2 agreement with all these observations .",
    "however , due to the relatively younger age the ltb-@xmath0cdm model might be disfavored by future observations .    besides , even if the ltb-@xmath0cdm model successfully passes all the tests of future observations , there might be some other problems in this scenario.(the discussions of these complicated problems are beyond the scope of this paper . )",
    "the main reason is that it is difficult to fit this model into the larger framework of fundamental physics such as particle physics , general relativity , astrophysics , and cosmology .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors mentioned the theory of structure formation and the integrated sachs - wolfe effect : study of these issues is very difficult in the ltb models .",
    "the topic of distinguishing the homogeneous @xmath0cdm model and the reconstructed inhomogeneous ltb-@xmath0cdm model is scientifically interesting and important , since it involves the question of the mysterious feature of dark energy and whether the nearby region of the universe is homogeneous .",
    "this topic should be carefully investigated . in this paper",
    "we propose the possibility of distinguishing the ltb-@xmath0cdm scenario with the standard @xmath0cdm model by performing the cosmic age test .",
    "the procedure is convenient and straightforward .",
    "although the result shows that the ltb-@xmath0cdm is still in 1@xmath2 agreement with current astronomical observations , since with the same set of parameters this model always has a younger age than the standard @xmath0cdm model it is possible to distinguish them from future observations . in all , the issue of using the cosmic age test to distinguish the reconstructed inhomogeneous ltb models from the homogeneous @xmath0cdm model is worth further investigation , and should be taken into consideration in future works , e.g. , in the cases when people try to construct a new model in the ltb scenario to explain the apparent cosmic acceleration .",
