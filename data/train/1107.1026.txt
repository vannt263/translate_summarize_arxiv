    "the smallness of the neutrino mass compared with the other quarks and leptons are one of the mysteries of nature .",

    "the similar mechanism generating the small neutrino dirac mass term for the tev seesaw mechanism is also proposed in @xcite and phenomenology is studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are also models with radiatively generated dirac mass term in @xcite .",
    "the interesting feature of the model proposed in @xcite is the tiny vacuum expectation value for an extra higgs su(2 ) doublet @xcite .",
    "the small neutrino mass is realized without introducing tiny yukawa coupling for neutrinos .",
    "a softly broken global u(1 ) symmetry guarantees the tiny vacuum expectation value for the extra doublet .",
    "in addition to the small softly breaking mass parameter , the mass squared parameter for the extra higgs is chosen to be positive so that the light pseudo nambu goldstone bosons due to the softly broken global symmetry do not appear .",
    "this is a contrast to the mass squared parameter for the standard model like higgs boson .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the global minimum of the tree level higgs potential by explicitly solving the stationary conditions .",
    "there are many studies of the tree level higgs potential of general two higgs doublet model @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for recent review of two higgs doublet model . )",
    "it has been shown that the charge neutral vacuum is lower than the charge breaking vacuum @xcite .",
    "also the vacuum energy difference of two neutral minima was derived @xcite .",
    "we make use of the results and identify the vacuum of the present model . when the u(1 ) symmetry breaking term is turned off , the tree level higgs potential and the phase structure of the present model is rather similar to the model with @xmath0 discrete symmetry @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0 symmetric case , it is essential to keep the soft breaking term when finding the true vacuum .",
    "if we set the symmetry breaking term at zero , then the order parameter corresponding to the softly broken u(1 ) symmetry becomes redundant parameter and can not be determined .",
    "we treat the soft breaking term as small expansion parameter and obtain the vacuum expectation values and the vacuum energies in terms of the parameters of the higgs potential .",
    "the constraints on the parameters of the model for which the desired vacuum can be realized , are derived and they are rewritten in terms of higgs masses and a few coupling constants which can not be directly related to the higgs masses .",
    "these constraints are fully used when we study the radiative corrections to the vacuum expectation values numerically .    beyond the tree level",
    ", we study the radiative correction to the higgs potential and the vacuum expectation values of higgs .",
    "since the neutrino masses are proportional to the vacuum expectation value of one of higgs , one can also compute the radiative corrections to neutrino masses . as already noted in @xcite the radiative correction to the softly breaking mass parameter",
    "is logarithmically divergent and it is renormalized multiplicatively .",
    "we derive the formulae for the one loop corrected vacuum expectation values for two higgs doublets by studying one loop corrected effective potential .",
    "the corrections are evaluated numerically by exploring the parameter regions allowed from the global minimum condition for the vacuum .",
    "we show how the radiative corrections change depending on the extra higgs spectrum .",
    "the radiative corrections are also evaluated for the case that a relation among the coupling constants is satisfied .",

    "if the charged higgs mass is as light as 100 ( gev ) @xmath28 200 ( gev ) , allowing the mass difference of charged higgs and pseudoscalar higgs is about @xmath53(gev ) , the quantum corrections to both @xmath9 and @xmath39 are within a few @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "if the charged higgs is heavy @xmath56 ( gev ) , a slight increase of the pseudoscalar higgs mass from the degenerate point leads to very large corrections to @xmath9 and @xmath39 .",
