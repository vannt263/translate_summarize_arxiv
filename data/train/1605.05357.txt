    "the description of non - equilibrium dynamics and thermalization in isolated quantum many - body systems has received renewed interest during the last years thanks mainly to the development of novel and powerful numerical approaches to study these problems , as well as , to the advance in sophisticated experimental techniques to control quantum systems with many degrees of freedom @xcite . while the connection between thermodynamics and statistical physics is clear in the context of microscopic laws governed by classical mechanics , for quantum mechanics is not the case because of the difficulties in defining important concepts like chaos , integrability and analytic solvability .",
    "we lack a complete framework able to explain how equilibrium and thermal states described by the ensembles of statistical mechanics arise from a microscopic description , and how a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) and its dynamics could be interpreted from the thermodynamic point of view .",
    "furthermore , in the case of many particles and degrees of freedom , the techniques developed to deal with the zero temperature case can not easily be extended for solving finite temperature problems @xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "quantum systems occupy only the ground - state",
    ". however , with finite temperature , a quantum system has enough thermal energy to occupy excited states .",
    "therefore , in order to study finite temperature problems in quantum many - body systems the information of their spectra is significant .",
    "this leads us to relate the point of view of statistical ensambles , where the temperature plays an important role , with the perspective of isolated systems , where the spectrum is relevant .",
    "one interesting feature of the spectrum in quantum many - body systems is the excited - state quantum phase transition ( esqpt ) .",
    "an esqpt is a singularity in the density of states which takes place along the energy spectrum for fixed values of the hamiltonian parameters @xcite and has a strong semi - classical connection @xcite .",
    "the esqpts have been studied in several nuclear physics models @xcite and it has been suggested they could have important effects in decoherence @xcite and the temporal evolution of quantum quenches @xcite . the relationship between the ground state qpts and esqpts is not completely clear , neither are the dynamical properties of the latter , so these issues are open to current research .    the aim of this work is to relate some critical features of the quantum spectrum in atom - field systems , specifically the qpt and esqpt , with their thermodynamics .",
    "we study these features in a generalized dicke model , including the dicke and tavis - cummings hamiltonians @xcite , which describe a system of @xmath0 two - level atoms interacting with a single monochromatic electromagnetic radiation mode within a cavity . in the language of quantum computing and quantum information , they also describe a set of @xmath0 qubits from quantum dots , bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices , and circuit qed @xcite interacting through a bosonic mode .    both hamiltonians are paradigmatic examples of quantum collective behavior in quantum optics . while the dicke hamiltonian is non - integrable , the tavis - cummings hamiltonian is its integrable version due the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) . the dicke model is interesting not only because its experimental realizations , but also thanks to its critical phenomena : the superradiant thermal phase transition @xcite , the well - known superradiant qpt , related with quantum chaos and entanglement @xcite , and the presence of ( _ dynamic _ and _ static _ ) esqpts @xcite .",
    "the dicke model is a suited toy model to explore the connection between thermodynamics and the spectrum of quantum systems . in order to address both hamiltonians at once , and",
    "at the same time to have the possibility to go from integrability to non - integrability , we put together the dicke and tavis - cummings hamiltonians in one expression introducing a control parameter .",
    "we call it the generalized dicke hamiltonian .",
    "originally , the thermodynamic analysis for the tavis - cummings model was presented by k. hepp and e. h. lieb in 1973 @xcite .",
    "their method was simplified trough the laplace s integral method and extended for the multimode case by wang and hioe @xcite .",
    "later , the counter - rotating terms were included in @xcite . in the following years",
    ", several authors developed different methods and approaches to study the thermodynamics of the dicke model @xcite .",
    "all these approaches rely on the canonical ensemble .",
    "the only analysis in the microcanonical ensamble we are aware of , presents some partial results employing non - normalized gaussian distributions @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the generalized dicke model . after a review of the well - known procedure to calculate the canonical partition function employing the laplace s integral method , used as reference",
    ", we make the calculation in the micro - canonical ensemble , building a natural link between the thermodynamics and the properties of the quantum spectrum .    as the generalized dicke hamiltonian commutes with the total pseudo spin operator @xmath1 , the hamiltonian is block - diagonal in subspaces labeled with @xmath2 running from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the eigenvalue of the total pseudo spin operator .",
    "in the last years most of the studies about the dicke model and its qpt have been restricted to the symmetric representation i. e. the subspace with maximum pseudo - spin sector @xmath6 , where the ground - state lies .",
    "nevertheless , in order to describe the thermodynamic properties of the full spectrum it is necessary to include all the @xmath2 sectors .",
    "as mentioned above , a satisfactory framework for this is still missing , so we employ a semi - classical approach to calculate the microcanonical ensamble .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we calculate the thermodynamics of the generalized dicke model in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the results of this section are recovered in section 3 , but from a microcanonical approach . in order to obtain the number of states for a given energy , a semi - classical approximation to the ground - state energies and to the density of states is obtained for each sector @xmath7 .",
    "likewise , the thermodynamical limit of the multiplicities @xmath8 is discussed and obtained .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions .",
    "besides , we present several appendixes with a detailed discussion of the calculations and other considerations about the thermal phases .",
    "in this section , we calculate the thermodynamics of the generalized dicke model following the traditional procedure for calculating the canonical partition function @xcite .",

    ", the operator does not affect the photon trace , only the atomic one , so we come back a few steps in order to calculate it .",

    "only one esqpt is observed at @xmath143 .",

    "it is interesting to observe ( see fig.[fig:6 ] ) that the region in the energy vs coupling space corresponding to @xmath149 ( the orange part of the sdos curves ) coincides with the region where the function @xmath38 of the canonical ensemble present two saddle points at @xmath150 , i.e. the region we have , already identified as the second superradiant phase that could be relevant in the finite size ( @xmath151 ) case .    with this",

    "besides , as it was already mentioned , we observe that for @xmath211 the derivative @xmath212 , consequently , @xmath213 and this energy range is unavailable for finite temperatures .",
    "finally , from ( [ eqn : temmic ] ) we can recover the internal energy in the micro canonical ensemble .",
    "for example , in the normal phase the energy is @xmath214 which agrees with our calculations in the canonical ensemble .    before concluding ,",
    "let us discuss the critical properties of the generalized dicke energy spectrum and their relation with the thermodynamical critical phenomena , under the light of our microcanonical results .",
    "as it was shown , the thermodynamical properties of the model are entirely given by the properties of the lowest energy state at each pseudospin @xmath2 .",
    "particularly , the thermal phase transition line between the normal and superradiant phase , is the aggregated of the qpts of each pseudospin @xmath215 . on the other hand ,",
    "the other critical phenomena observed in the energy spectrum , the so called esqpts , since they occur at energies larger than the minimal energy of each pseudo - spin @xmath2 have no effect or manifestation in the thermal properties .",
    "one of them , the called _",
    "static _ esqpt occuring at energy @xmath216 , belongs to a forbidden thermodynamic energy region ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "the other two esqpts , the one occurring at @xmath217 and that at @xmath145 , even if they are in an energy range thermally available , their contributions to the thermodynamics are negligible , and their effects disappear completely in the thermodynamical limit . nonetheless , it would be interesting to determine whether the esqpts have any effect or manifestation in the finite size corrections to the thermodynamical ( @xmath154 ) limit , which goes beyond scope of the present contribution .",
    "other interesting topic in the study of the finite size corrections , would be the comparison between a canonical and a microcanonical approach . in the thermodynamical limit , this work has explicitly shown that both descriptions give exactly the same results .",
    "we have solved the thermodynamics of the generalized dicke model both in the canonical and , for the first time , in the microcanonical ensemble . in order to calculate the microcanonical ensemble we employed a semi - classical approximation for the density of states .",
    "we showed results for all the relevant observables , which let us in a simple way recover the results for interesting temperature limits , @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the results for both ensembles agree in the thermodynamical limit , and , in this way we linked the point of view of the canonical statistical ensambles and the perspective of isolated quantum systems . besides , we obtained expression for the semiclassical dos for the extended dicke model .",
    "all of these calculations could help to study problems with a tunable parameter between an integrable system ( tavis - cummings ) and a non - integrable one ( dicke ) .",
    "like the dicke and tavis - cummings models , the generalized dicke model studied here exhibits only two thermal phases in the thermodynamical limit , a normal and a superradiant phase .",
    "however , unlike the dicke or tavis - cummings models , we identify a region which potentially could give rise to a second superradiant phase",
    ". however , this second superradiant phase can not be an equilibrium state .",
    "from the thermodynamic point of view , it corresponds to a saddle point , i. e. a non stable phase . from the semi - classical point of view , it is not the minimum of the classical energy surface .",
    "the minimum corresponds to the first superradiant phase .",
    "the second superradiant phase could have observable effects only in the finite size case .",
    "we connected in a simple way the thermal phase transition in the generalized dicke model with the qpts of the lowest energy states of each subspace of pseudospin @xmath2 , by calculating , for each subspace , their degeneracies and semi - classical lowest energies and densities of states .",
    "we found that the curve in the energy - coupling space where the qpt for each subspace @xmath2 takes place reproduces the curve of the critical energy corresponding to the critical temperature in the phase diagram , i.e. , to the thermal phase transition .",
    "then , the superradiant qpt is the thermal superradiant phase transition .",
    "so , we have related these critical phenomena in the spectrum with its thermal counterpart .",
    "the excited states of every @xmath2 are thermodynamically inaccessible , and the thermodynamical properties of the model are entirely given by the lowest energy states of each pseudospin @xmath2 .",
    "consequently the critical phenomena observed in the excited energy spectrum , the so called esqpts , have no effect and manifestation in the thermal properties .",
    "however they could be of interest in a finite size study of the model @xcite .",
    "the region of positive energies was also shown to be thermally inaccesible .",
    "the formalism presented here is immediately applicable to other systems formed by a set of @xmath0 identical few level atoms whose hamiltonians are expressed in terms of collective operators satisfying a given algebra .",
    "example of this is the lipkin - meshkov - glick model whose hamiltonian is expressed in terms of @xmath221 operators .",
    "we hope the formalism presented here could help to understand the relationship between the critical properties of the quantum spectrum with the thermal critical phenomena .",
    "also , this approach could help the developing of techniques to study finite temperature problems in isolated quantum many - body systems .",

    "<S> the thermodynamical properties of a generalized dicke model are calculated and related with the critical properties of its energy spectrum , namely the quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) and excited state quantum phase transitions ( esqpt ) . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal properties are calculated both in the canonical and the microcanonical ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> the latter deduction allows for an explicit description of the relation between thermal and energy spectrum properties . while in an isolated system </S>",
    "<S> the subspaces with different pseudo spin are disconnected , and the whole energy spectrum is accesible , in the thermal ensamble the situation is radically different . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicity of the lowest energy states for each pseudo spin completely dominates the thermal behavior , making the set of degenerate states with the smallest pseudo spin at a given energy the only ones playing a role in the thermal properties , making the positive energy states thermally inaccesible . their quantum phase transitions , from a normal to a superradiant phase , </S>",
    "<S> are closely associated with the thermal transition . </S>",
    "<S> the other critical phenomena , the esqpts occurring at excited energies , have no manifestation in the thermodynamics , although their effects could be seen in finite sizes corrections . a new superradiant phase is found , which only exists in the generalized model , and can be relevant in finite size systems .    _ </S>",
