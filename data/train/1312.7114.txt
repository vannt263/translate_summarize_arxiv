    "understanding the quark - gluon structure of the nucleon is one of the most important unsolved problems in high energy physics . to reveal it ,",
    "the deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) has played a pivotal role over several decades .",
    "the differential cross section of unpolarized dis is expressed with the two independent structure functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath0 is the bjorken scaling variable and @xmath7 is the photon four - momentum squared .",
    "since the structure functions are basically nonperturbative physical quantities , we can not directly calculate them . moreover , particularly in the small @xmath0 region , gluons are the dominant `` constituents '' and the analyses become much more complicated .    in the circumstance , the birth of the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence ( or gauge / string correspondence in general )  @xcite was one of the breakthroughs in high energy physics , which has provided us with opportunities to analytically investigate the nonperturbative regions in gauge theories including quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . using this correspondence",
    ", one can perform analyses of the strong coupling gauge theory in the usual minkowski space by the classical theory of gravitation in the higher dimensional curved space .",
    "so far , two ways have been proposed to apply the conjectured correspondence to qcd , the string theoretical top - down approach  @xcite and the phenomenological bottom - up approach  @xcite , according to the ads / cft dictionary . for both of them",
    ", various applications to phenomenological studies were done successfully  @xcite .    the first study for dis via ads / cft correspondence",
    "was done by polchinski and strassler  @xcite , and the pomeron exchange kernel was proposed by brower , polchinski , strassler , and tan ( bpst )  @xcite .",
    "the pomeron was originally introduced to describe the high energy scattering in the 1960 s based on analyticity of the @xmath10-matrix , and now it is assumed to be the complicated multi - gluon exchange in qcd . assuming the single - pomeron exchange picture , one can express the @xmath11 structure function at small @xmath0 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the pomeron intercept . in their study ,",
    "the pomeron in the usual minkowski space is identified as the reggeized graviton in the ads space , and the bpst kernel describes the pomeron ( graviton ) exchange contribution to the total cross section .",
    "subsequent to several elaborated analyses  @xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors showed that the experimental data of the nucleon @xmath11 structure function at small @xmath0 and the scale dependence of the pomeron intercept can be well reproduced by using the bpst kernel with the `` super local approximation '' for the pomeron couplings . subsequently in ref .",
    "@xcite , the present authors proposed another description of the structure functions of hadrons at small @xmath0 without assuming the super local approximation . in the study , they considered the more phenomenologically realistic pomeron couplings and showed that the consistent results for the nucleon @xmath11 can be obtained and structure functions for other hadrons can also be calculated in their model .    in this study , we improve the description of the target nucleon in the model setup of the previous study , and present more consistent analyses focusing on the highly nonperturbative kinematical region where @xmath1 and @xmath14 a few  [ gev@xmath3 .",
    "to realize the improvement , we describe the nucleon by introducing a soft - wall ads / qcd model , in which the ads geometry is smoothly cut off in the infrared ( ir ) region , instead of the hard - wall model adopted in the previous work  @xcite .",
    "the hard - wall model , in which the sharp cutoff for the geometry is imposed , has often been used to describe hadronic properties , because the calculations are much simpler and the analytical expressions can be easily obtained in general . however",
    ", when we consider masses of the excited mesons ( not the ground state ) , there is a crucial difference between results obtained by the soft- and hard - wall models . in hard - wall models , the squared masses of mesons",
    "@xmath15 with the excitation number @xmath16 grow as @xmath17 , while the correct regge behavior , @xmath18 , can be reproduced only in the soft - wall model  @xcite . when we consider the nucleon ,",
    "the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that for the soft - wall model , the correct regge behavior can be reproduced  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is not clear whether our previous treatment with the hard - wall model is adequate to the description of the structure function of the nucleon . to draw a conclusion for this question , testing the soft - wall version of the previous study",
    "is needed , and this is a primary aim of this paper . in actual calculations ,",
    "we improve the overlap function of the nucleon , which represents the nucleon - pomeron coupling , within the soft - wall model of ads / qcd .",
    "moreover , we also investigate the bpst pomeron kernel with the modification from the soft - wall model .",
    "analyses on the nucleon longitudinal structure function @xmath19 are also newly presented here . in the quark - parton model ,",
    "the structure functions are expressed as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , where @xmath22 is the quark charge and @xmath23 is the quark distribution function . however , experimental data show that @xmath19 does not vanish , which is due to the complicated gluon interactions . hence , studying the longitudinal structure function provides a unique opportunity to investigate the nonperturbative effects in qcd . in our framework , once we fix three adjustable parameters with the experimental data for @xmath4 , we can predict the @xmath19 structure function without further ambiguities .",
    "we also consider the longitudinal - to - transverse ratio of the structure functions , @xmath24 , which is a completely non - trivial physical quantity especially in the kinematical region we focus on in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : level2 ] , we present the whole setup of the model by introducing the bpst pomeron exchange kernel .",
    "we show how to obtain the pomeron - nucleon coupling in the ads space in sec .",

    "following the previous studies  @xcite , the holographic description of structure functions can be realized with the bpst pomeron exchange kernel and overlap functions ( or form factors in the 5d ads space ) .",
    "the amplitude for high energy two - body scattering , @xmath25 , can be expressed with the two - dimensional impact parameter @xmath26 and the fifth ( or bulk ) coordinates @xmath27 ( for the incident particle ) and @xmath28 ( for the target particle ) in the eikonal representation as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are overlap functions , which contain the information on internal structure of incoming and outgoing particles .    here , we focus on the nucleon dis , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in this case , the overlap functions are understood as density distributions in the ads space .",
    "the nucleon is an on - shell state , hence the nucleon overlap function @xmath31 satisfies the normalization condition ,",
    "@xmath34    we calculate the structure function considering the @xmath35 forward scattering amplitude by virtue of the optical theorem . keeping only the leading contribution to the eikonal approximation in eq .",
    ", i.e. considering the single - pomeron exchange , the structure functions at small @xmath0 are written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is for the longitudinal structure function @xmath19 and @xmath38 for @xmath11 .    in the conformal limit",
    ", the analytical form of the imaginary part of @xmath39 can be obtained , and the impact parameter integration can be demonstrated explicitly .",

    "is calculated in the conformal limit . however , the conformal symmetry is certainly broken in real qcd due to the nonperturbative effect such as color confinement .",

    "it seems , however , that such differences are absorbed into the readjustment of some of the model parameters , yielding quantitatively very similar numerical results for both soft- and hard - wall cases .",
    "therefore , the hard - wall model is still a valuable practical tool when we build a model of the ground state hadrons .",
    "second , the holographic approach provides a reasonable description of the high energy scattering phenomena , and further studies are certainly needed .",
    "the ads / qcd can be a powerful analytical tool as a `` building block '' to build a model of the nonperturbative qcd , although this approach involves fundamental uncertainties related to the original ads / cft correspondence . in principle , by giving the appropriate density distributions in the ads space for the incident and target particles , other two - body high energy scattering processes can be studied in this framework .",

    "<S> , we improve the description of the target nucleon in the current setup of the holographic model by introducing a soft - wall ads / qcd model , in which the ads geometry is smoothly cut off at the infrared boundary . combining the improved pomeron - nucleon coupling and the wave function of the 5d u(1 ) vector field with the bpst pomeron exchange kernel </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the structure functions . here </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the nonperturbative kinematical region , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 a few  [ gev@xmath3 , and show that our calculations for @xmath4 and @xmath5 are consistent with experimental data of the deep inelastic scattering at hera . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the resulting longitudinal - to - transverse ratio of the structure functions , @xmath6 , depends on both @xmath0 and @xmath7 . </S>"
