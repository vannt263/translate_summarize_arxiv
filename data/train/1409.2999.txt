    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been very successful in describing nature at the weak scale , however , there are many unexplained puzzles left , that implies going beyond sm .",
    "three concrete evidences for physics beyond sm are : ( i ) non zero neutrino masses , ( ii ) the existence of dark matter ( dm ) , and ( iii ) the observation of matter anti matter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "however , most of the sm extensions make no attempt to address these three puzzles within the same framework . for instance ,",
    "a popular extension of the sm , is introducing very heavy right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos ( @xmath2 ) , where small neutrino masses are generated via the see - saw mechanism @xcite , and the bau is produced via leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a rh neutrino heavier than @xmath3 , decouples from the effective low energy theory , and can not be tested at collider experiments .",
    "a small neutrino mass can be generated radiatively , where the famous example is the so - called zee model @xcite . in zee - model ,",
    "the solar mixing angle comes out to be close to maximal , which is excluded by the solar neutrino oscillation data @xcite .",
    "this problem is circumvented in models where neutrinos are induced at two loops @xcite or three loops @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of this class of models is that all the mass scales are in the tev or sub - tev range , which makes it possible for them to be tested at future colliders . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sm was extended with two charged @xmath4 singlet scalars and one rh neutrino field , @xmath5 , where a @xmath6 symmetry was imposed to forbid the dirac neutrino mass terms at tree level @xcite . after the electroweak symmetry breaking , tiny neutrino masses are naturally generated at three loops due to the high loop suppression . a consequence of the @xmath6 symmetry and the field content of the model , @xmath5 is @xmath6-odd , and thus guaranteed to be stable , which makes it a good dm candidate . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors considered extending the fermion sector of the sm with two rh neutrinos , in order for it to be consistent with the neutrino oscillation data , and they studied also its phenomenological implications .    in @xcite , we calculated the three loop neutrino masses exactly , as compared to the approximate expression derived in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that in order to satisfy the recent experimental bound on the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) process such as @xmath7 @xcite ; and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xcite , one must have three generations of rh neutrinos . taking into account the neutrino oscillation data and the lfv constraints , we show that the lightest rh neutrino can account for the dm abundance with masses lighter than 225 .",
    "the presence of the charged scalars in this model will affect the higgs decay process @xmath0 and can lead to an enhancement with respect to the sm , where as @xmath1 is slightly reduced . in this model , we find that a strongly electroweak phase transition can be achieved with a higgs mass of @xmath8 as measured at the lhc @xcite .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in the next section we present the model , and discuss the constraints from the lfv processes . in section iii",
    ", we study the relic density of the lightest rh neutrino and different dm features in this model .",
    "section iv is devoted to the study of the electroweak phase transition combined with the effect of the presence of extra charged scalars on the higgs decay channels @xmath0  and @xmath9 . in section",
    "v , we discuss the phenomenological implications of the rh neutrinos at the ilc . finally we conclude in section vi .",
    "our model is just the sm extended by three rh neutrinos , @xmath10 , and two charged singlet scalars , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in addition",
    ", we impose a discrete @xmath6 symmetry on the model , under which @xmath13 , and all other fields are even .",
    "the lagrangian reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath16 is the charge conjugation matrix , @xmath17 are yukawa couplings which are antisymmetric in the generation indices @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20  are the majorana rh neutrino masses ; and @xmath21 is the tree - level scalar potential which is given by @xmath22 where  @xmath23 is the sm higgs doublet . the @xmath6 symmetry imposed on the lagrangian",
    "implies:(1 ) if @xmath24 is the lightest particle among @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then it would be stable , and hence it is a candidate for dark matter",
    ". moreover , @xmath10 will be pair produced and subsequently decay into @xmath24 ( or to @xmath27 and then to @xmath24 ) and a pair ( or two pairs ) of charged leptons .",
    "we will discuss its phenomenology later .",
    "( 2 ) the dirac neutrino mass term is forbidden at all levels of the perturbation theory , and majorana neutrinos masses are generated radiatively at three - loops , as shown in fig .",
    "[ diag]-left .        the exact estimation of the diagram in fig",
    ". [ diag ] leads to @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 are flavor ( eigenstates ) indices , and the function @xmath30 is a loop integral given in ( a.8 ) in @xcite , which was approximated to one in the original work @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the radiatively generated neutrino masses are directly proportional to the charged leptons and rh neutrino masses as shown in ( [ nu - mass-1 ] ) unlike the conventional seesaw mechanism . the neutrino mass matrix elements ( [ nu - mass-1 ] )",
    "should fit the experimental values @xmath31_{\\alpha\\beta},\\label{comp}%\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the pontecorvo - maki - nakawaga - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix @xcite , where the mixing angles are given by the experimental allowed values for @xmath33 * * , * * @xmath34 * * , * * @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and the mass differences * *  * * @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "besides neutrino masses and mixing , the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) induces flavor violating processes such as @xmath41 if @xmath42 , generated at one loop via the exchange of both extra charged scalars @xmath43 . the branching ratio of such process can be computed as @xcite @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the fine structure constant and @xmath47 .",
    "another constraint which the bound on the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath48 , that receives the contribution @xcite @xmath49    in fig .",
    "[ amu]-left , we show a scattered plot of the muon anomalous magnetic moment versus the @xmath50 decay effective majorana mass @xmath51 , where the considered upper bound is @xmath52 @xcite . in our parameter space scan , we consider @xmath53 * ; * and demanded that ( [ nu - mass-1 ] ) to be consistent with the neutrino oscillation data . from fig .",
    "[ amu]-left , one can see that most of the values of @xmath54 that are consistent with the bound on @xmath48 are lying in the range @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "[ amu]-right gives an idea about the magnitude of the couplings that satisfy the constraints from lfv processes and the muon anomalous magnetic moment , and which also are consistent with the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "it is worth noting that when considering just two generations of rh neutrinos ( i.e , @xmath57 ) , we find that the bound @xmath58 is violated @xcite . therefore , having three rh neutrinos is necessary for it to be in agreement with the data from the bounds from lfv processes .",
    "moreover , one has to mention that the bound on @xmath59 makes the parameters space very constrained .",
    "for instance , out of the benchmarks that are in agreement with the neutrino oscillation data , dm and @xmath48 , only about 15% of the points will survive after imposing the @xmath7 bound .",
    "decay effective majorana @xmath60 .",
    "the blue lines represent their experimental upper bounds .",

    "as mentioned above , the lightest rh neutrino @xmath24 is stable , and could be the dm candidate . in the case of hierarchical rh neutrino mass spectrum , we can safely neglect the effect of @xmath27 and @xmath62 on @xmath24 density .",
    "the @xmath24 number density get depleted through the annihilation process @xmath63 via the @xmath64-channel exchange of @xmath12 . after estimating the feynman diagrams , squaring , summing and averaging over the spin states",
    ", we find that in the non - relativistic limit , the total annihilation cross section is given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 is the relative velocity between the annihilation @xmath67 s .",
    "as the temperature of the universe drops below the freeze - out temperature @xmath68 , the annihilation rate becomes smaller than the expansion rate ( the hubble parameter ) of the universe , and the @xmath24 s start to decouple from the thermal bath .",
    "the relic density after the decoupling can be obtained by solving the boltzmann equation , and it is approximately given by @xcite@xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ msmn ] , we plot the allowed mass range @xmath70 plane that give the observed dark matter relic density @xcite . as seen in the figure , the neutrino experimental data combined with the relic density seems to prefer @xmath71 for large space of parameters .",
    "however , the masses of both the dm and the charged scalar @xmath12 can not exceed @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "[ om ]     ( red ) and @xmath74 ( green ) versus the lightest rh neutrino mass , where the consistency with the neutrino data , lfv constraints and the dm relic density have been imposed.__,width=264,height=188 ]    in computing the relic density in ( [ omh2 ] ) , we have assumed that there is a hierarchy between the three right - handed neutrino masses . however , when the possibility for @xmath27 and/or @xmath62 being close in mass to @xmath24 , i.e @xmath75 , is considered , the coannihilation processes like @xmath76 might enhance the relic density values by three if the degeneracy is around @xmath77 .",
    "it is well known that the sm has all the qualitative ingredients for electroweak baryogenesis , but the amount of matter - antimatter asymmetry generated is too small .",
    "one of the reasons is that the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is not strongly first order , which is required to suppress the sphaleron processes in the broken phase .",
    "the strength of the ewpt can be improved if there are new scalar degrees of freedom around the electroweak scale coupled to the sm higgs , which is the case in the model that we are considering in this paper .",
    "the investigation of the transition dynamics and its strength requires the precise knowledge of the effective potential of the cp - even scalar fields at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the one - loop higgs effective potential is given in the @xmath78 scheme by @xmath79 where @xmath80  is the real part of the neutral component in the doublet , @xmath81  are the field multiplicities , @xmath82 are the field - dependent mass squared which are given in appendix b in @xcite , and @xmath83 is the renormalization scale which we choose to be the top quark mass . where the summation is performed over the scalar longitudinal gauge degrees of freedom , and @xmath84 are their thermal masses , which are given in appendix b. the contribution ( [ ring ] ) is obtained by performing the resummation of an infinite class of of infrared divergent multi - loops , known as the ring ( or daisy ) diagrams , which describes a dominant contribution of long distances and gives significant contribution when massless states appear in a system .",
    "it amounts to shifting the longitudinal gauge boson and the scalar masses obtained by considering only the first two terms in the effective potential @xcite .",
    "this shift in the thermal masses of longitudinal gauge bosons and not their transverse parts tends to reduce the strength of the phase transition .",
    "the integrals ( [ jbf ] ) is often estimated in the high temperature approximation , however , in order to take into account the effect of all the ( heavy and light ) degrees of freedom , we evaluate them numerically .    in order to generate a baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale @xcite , the anomalous violating @xmath85 interactions should be switched - off inside the nucleated bubbles , which implies the famous condition for a strong first order phase transition @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the critical temperature at which the effective potential exhibits two degenerate minima , one at zero and the other at @xmath88 .",
    "both @xmath87 and @xmath89 are determined using the full effective potential at finite temperature ( [ veff ] ) .    in the sm ,",
    "the ratio @xmath90 is approximately @xmath91 , and therefore the criterion for a strongly first phase transition is not fulfilled for @xmath92 .",
    "however , if the one - loop corrections in ( [ mh ] ) are sizeable , then this bound could be relaxed in such a way that the higgs mass is consistent with the measured value at the lhc",
    ". this might be possible since the extra charged scalars affect the dynamics of the sm scalar field vev around the critical temperature @xcite .    in this model , the one loop correction to the higgs mass due to the charged singlets , when neglecting the higgs and gauge bosons contributions , is@xmath93 where the first term on the right hand side of the equation is the higgs mass at the tree level .",
    "if one takes @xmath94 and @xmath95 , then the higgs mass is exactly 125@xmath96 for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath55 if @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "note that these values are still within the perturbative regime . on the other hand , these extra corrections could be negative and may relax the large tree - level mass value of the higgs to its experimental value for @xmath102 large .",
    "therefore , it is expected that these extra charged scalars will help the ewpt to be strongly first order by enhancing the value of the effective potential at the wrong vacuum at the critical temperature without suppressing the ratio @xmath90 , and therefore avoiding the severe bound on the mass of the sm higgs . however , as it has been shown in the previous section , the relic density requires large values for @xmath103 and so the higgs mass in eq .",
    "( [ mh ] ) can be easily set to its experimental value ( @xmath104),while keeping @xmath26 light , for small doublet quartic coupling ( which gives a strong ewpt ) .",
    "thus , both the measured values of the higgs mass and the requirement for the ewpt to be strongly first order are not in conflict with values of @xmath105 smaller than @xmath106 ( as required from the observed relic density ) .    during the universe cooling , the higgs vev decreases slower than the sm case , where it decays quickly to zero just around @xmath107 .",
    "here it is delayed up to @xmath108 due to the existence of the extra charged scalars ; and the ewpt occurs around @xmath107 due to the fact that the effective potential at the wrong vacuum ( @xmath109 ) is temperature - dependant through the charged scalars thermal masses in the symmetric phase @xcite .    in july 2012 ,",
    "atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations have announced the observation of a scalar particle with mass @xmath8 at about @xmath110 confidence level .",
    "the question is whether or not this is really the sm higgs or some higgs - like state with different properties .",
    "indeed , the fit of the data by the atlas collaboration seems to show an excess in @xmath0 events by more than @xmath111 with respect to the sm , while the updated cms analysis is consistent with the sm .",
    "defining @xmath112 and @xmath113  to be the decay width of @xmath0  and @xmath1 respectively , scaled by their expected sm value , we find that @xmath114 where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , with @xmath117 is the mass of the charged particle x running in the loop , @xmath118 is the color number , @xmath119 is the electric charge of the top quark in unit of @xmath120 , and the loop functions @xmath121 are defined in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the effect on @xmath122 the charged scalar singlets will depend on how light are @xmath123 , the sign and the strength of their couplings to the sm higgs doublet .",
    "for instance , an enhancement can be achieved by taking @xmath124 and/or @xmath125 to be negative .    in fig .",
    "[ ct ] , we present the ratio @xmath90  versus the critical temperature @xmath87 ( left ) ; and @xmath112 versus @xmath126 ( right ) for randomly chosen sets of parameters where the charged scalars are taken to be heavier than 100 @xmath127 , the higgs mass within the range @xmath128 . in our numerical scan ,",
    "we take the model parameters relevant for the higgs decay to be in the range@xmath129 where the higgs mass is calculated at one - loop level .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath122 can be obtained for a large range of parameter space , whereas @xmath130 is slightly reduced with respect to the sm .",
    "it is interesting to note that if one consider the combined atlas and cms di - photon excess , then @xmath113 is predicted to be smaller than the expected sm value by approximately @xmath131 .     in ( [ v / t ] ) . in the right one ,",

    "right : the modified higgs decay rates @xmath122 vs @xmath130 , scaled by their sm values , due to the extra charged scalars , for randomly chosen sets of parameters .",
    "the magenta ( yellow ) line represents the atlas ( cms ) recent measurements on the @xmath0 channel , while the blue one is their combined result.__,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=188 ]   in ( [ v / t ] ) . in the right one , the relative contribution of the one - loop corrections ( including the counter - terms ) to the higgs mass versus the parameter @xmath102 .",

    "[ ct ] , we can see that one can have a strongly first order ewpt while the critical temperature lies around 100 @xmath127 without being in conflict with the measured value of the higgs mass ; while @xmath112 can have an enhancement where @xmath113 remains almost constant .",
    "the rh neutrinos do couple to the charged leptons only , then one excepts them to be produced at @xmath132 colliders , such as the ilc and clic with a collision energy @xmath133 of few hundreds up to tev .",
    "if a @xmath134 pair is produced inside the collider , they will decay to pairs of charged leptons and @xmath135 , where the charged leptons have not necessary the same flavor .",

    "the process @xmath139  can be a good probe for this model , however there are here so many contributions to the missing energy whose sources both the f s and g s vertices in ( [ l ] ) @xcite . here , we analyze the production of all possible pairs of rh neutrinos , tagged with a photon from an initial state radiation , that is @xmath140 ( with @xmath141 ) , where one searches for a high @xmath142 gamma balancing the invisible rh neutrinos .",
    "if the emitted photon is soft or collinear , then one can use the soft / collinear factorization form @xcite @xmath143 with @xmath144 , here @xmath145  is the angle between the photon and electron and @xmath146 is the cross section evaluated at the reduced center of mass energy @xmath147 .",
    "collinear photon with the incident electron or positron could be a good positive signal , especially if the enhancement in ( [ fsr ] ) is more significant than the sm background .",
    "there are two leading sm background processes : a ) the neutrino counting process @xmath148 from the t - channel @xmath149 exchange and the s - channel @xmath150 exchange , and b ) the bhabha scattering with an extra photon @xmath151 , which can mimic the @xmath152 signature when the accompanying electrons or photons leave the detector through the beam pipe @xcite .",
    "in addition to putting the cut on the energy of the emitted photon , one can reduce further the mono - photon neutrino background , by polarizing the incident electron and positron beams such that @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the number densities of the left ( right)-handed electrons and positrons per unit time in the beam . at @xmath156",
    "the process @xmath157 is dominated by the @xmath149-exchange , and hence one expect that having the electron ( positron ) beam composed mostly of polarized right handed ( left handed ) electrons ( positron ) reduces this background substantially , whereas the signal increases since @xmath10 couples to the right handed electrons .",
    "when estimating the total cross section @xmath158 @xcite , we can present the differential cross section versus the photon energy for two values of collision energies @xmath159  and 1 ; using the approximation ( [ fsr ] ) , by integrating over the angle @xmath145 taking into account the minimum value of electromagnetic calorimeter acceptance in the ilc to be @xmath160  @xcite .     where the curves : red , green , black , blue , yellow , magenta correspond to ( i , k)=(1,1 ) , ( 1,2 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 1,3 ) , ( 2,3 ) , ( 3,3 ) respectively . here , we considered the following favored mass values : @xmath161 gev , @xmath162 gev , @xmath163 gev , @xmath164 gev , and the coupling values : @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167.__,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=188 ] where the curves : red , green , black , blue , yellow , magenta correspond to ( i , k)=(1,1 ) , ( 1,2 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 1,3 ) , ( 2,3 ) , ( 3,3 ) respectively . here , we considered the following favored mass values : @xmath161 gev , @xmath162 gev , @xmath163 gev , @xmath164 gev , and the coupling values : @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167.__,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=188 ]    we see that for the benchmark shown in fig .",
    "[ ga ] , the heaviest rh neutrino is largely produced due to its large couplings to the electron / positron .",
    "thus , for this particular benchmark the missing energy is dominated not by the dm , but rather by the other rh neutrinos .",
    "another interesting process that might be possible to search for at both lepton and hadron colliders is the production of @xmath123 . at the lhc they can be pair produced in an equal number via the drell - yan process , with a production rate of @xmath123 that is suppressed at very high energies , and",
    "so we expect that most of the produced @xmath123 will have energies not too far from their masses .",
    "then , each pair of charged scalars decays into charged leptons and missing energy , such as @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 .",
    "the observation of an electron ( positron ) and anti - muon ( muon ) , will be a strong signal for the production of the charged scalars of this model .",
    "the energy carried out by the charged leptons , @xmath171 , produced in the decay of @xmath123 will be limited by the phase space available to @xmath24 and @xmath172 since @xmath173 . on the other hand ,",
    "the leptons originating from the decay of @xmath11 will be produced in association with a sm neutrino , and hence can have energy as large as @xmath174 .",
    "thus , by putting the appropriate energy cuts on the energy of final states @xmath175 and discriminating the sm background ( from the decay of @xmath176 ) , one can , in principle , identify the signal for the charged scalars .",
    "this requires a detailed a analysis which we plan to carry out in a future publication @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed a radiative model for neutrino masses , generated at three loop level . beside it",
    "can accommodate the neutrino oscillation data and be consistent with the lfv processes , it provides a dm candidate with a mass lying between few up to 225 ; and a relatively light charged scalar , @xmath12 , with a mass below 245 .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the charged scalar singlets can give an enhancement for @xmath177 , whereas the decay @xmath178 get a small suppression , compared to the sm .",
    "we also found that charged scalars with masses close the electroweak scale make the electroweak phase transition strongly first order . since @xmath24 couples only to leptons , it can not be observed in experiments for direct dark matter searches",
    ". however it might be possible to search for such particle in indirect detection experiments , such as fermi - lat , and at future linear colliders , such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "thus , for this particular benchmark the missing energy is dominated not by the dm , but rather by the other rh neutrinos .    *",
