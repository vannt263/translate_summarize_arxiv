    "the safely correct development and credible presentation of a physical theory implies identifying physical phenomena to which the theory is assuredly applicable , however small such a validity domain would seem to be at the outset .",
    "historically , the special relativity theory came along in attempts to make newtonian / euclidean description of moving macroscopic bodies consistent with optical phenomena observable by means of these bodies .",
    "seminal paper@xcite establishes the principle of relativity and an idea that propagation of light does not depend on the motion of its source and can be used to define simultaneous events at different places as premises of a physically reasonable way to arrive at lorentz transformation , reproduced in subsequent monographs@xcite and textbooks@xcite .",
    "the alternative post - einsteinian presentation@xcite of the relativity theory brought einstein s attempts to identify physical foundations of the problem to its actual formal source : the required change of a coordinate system should preserve the form of free motion of point particles along with the speed of light @xmath0 as a universal limitation on the speed of any particle .",
    "such a mathematical approach appears physically important because it provides a consistent description of the macroscopically perceived ( commonly referred to as kinematic@xcite ) part of experimental particle physics : registering devices embedded in the solid wall of an accelerator can embody an inertial reference frame along with its euclidean geometry ; registrable / inferable collisions between particles are events .    up to the present time",
    ", all expositions of the special relativity theory heavily rely on cartesian coordinates for both formulating premises and developing inferences . apparently , within macroscopic physics resorting to that handy mathematical technique",
    "imposes no restriction on the applicability of such a reasoning .",
    "however , good practice of using coordinates in physics and engineering implies that the choice of coordinate systems should facilitate the application of basic / general regularities / rules to a particular problem , so that it is the spatial configuration of the problem that actually determines whether a suitable coordinate system is cartesian , or orthogonal curvilinear , or even special such as barycentric etc .    in the next section",
    "the reader can find a remainder of what physics secures the existence of frames and actually underlies the validity of euclidean geometry .",
    "section [ basic effects ] presents the concept of a boost direction , which enables the subsequent physics oriented inference of the well known spatio - temporal effects related to the special relativity theory .",
    "section [ transformation ] exploits these effects to formulate the relation between the time moments and the position vectors of a given event in two frames .",
    "this relation entails a logically consistent and physically meaningful presentation of the well known coordinate transformations in section [ coordinate transformations ] .",
    "within macroscopic physics , a ( necessarily inertial ) frame can be provisionally viewed as a rigid construct , which means that the spatial relations between its parts obey the rules of euclidean geometry .",
    "making use of this well known mathematical structure in the description of undeformed ( or , equivalently , non - accelerating and non - rotating ) macroscopic solids is evidently valid , which suggests that the regularities of statics ( supplemented with hooke law to resolve statics ambiguities ) can underlie euclidean geometry .",
    "usually , this formal struture is believed to be applicable to a wider range of spatial scales as well as a larger class of physical phenomena .",
    "so other regularities , such as those of electromagnetism and gravity , may take part in maintaining euclidean geometry for the set of all possible positions of sufficiently small interacting bodies.@xcite    as of now , the group of motions of rigid bodies ( described axiomatically ) is the only mathematical structure that reminds us of the physical foundation of euclidean geometry .",
    "the group includes spatial translations @xmath1 and rotations @xmath2 . the additive representation of a spatial translation is usually referred to as a spatial vector .",
    "one can use rotations to introduce an angle between two vectors etc .",
    "when the orthonormal vectors @xmath3 represent the translations along three mutually perpendicular directions , the decomposition @xmath4 of a displacement ( the change of a position vector @xmath5 ) is just what defines cartesian coordinates .",
    "this formal structure refers those interested in the origin of euclidean geometry to the physics of solids , which may not be a reasonable starting point of an investigation aimed something in the physics of fields and particles .",
    "meanwhile , it is newtonian laws that make an established formalism of mechanics . within the limitations imposed by microscopic phenomena ,",
    "newtonian formalism is believed to be applicable to each sufficiently small part of a macroscopic body , referred to as a point particle .    to calculate how the position vector @xmath6 of each particle @xmath7 is changing over time ,",
    "a theorist should invoke newton s second law @xmath8 here and hereinafter the notation @xmath9 is used for the list of expressions @xmath10 where the label @xmath7 runs over all its values .    within the purely mechanical formalism",
    ", the force of action of a particle @xmath11 on a particle @xmath7 can not be but conservative : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the nabla operator designed to act on functions of the position vector @xmath6 .",
    "for an isolated system of n particles and given functions @xmath14 , the decomposition turns eqs .   into a closed set of 3n differential equations of second order .",
    "its general solution @xmath15 involves 6n arbitrary constants , of which one is the time reference shift @xmath16 while seven can be the total energy @xmath17 and the components of the total momentum @xmath18 and the total angular momentum @xmath19 . in other words , inversion of the set of eqs .",
    "can yield 6n-8 constants of motions @xmath20 , possibly specific for each sufficiently small interval of @xmath21 , in addition to the seven universal constants of motion : @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24.\\ ] ]    of these functions , only @xmath25 essentially represent the internal / relative motions of the particles while @xmath17 describes the overall intensity of the whole motion , which can be arbitrary normalized by the choice of the unit of the time @xmath21 ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to the well known global directions related to the whole motion .",
    "the formalism based on the use of position vectors , their decompositions and eqs .   may not be a consistent introduction to foundations since it refers to the regularities / notions left without description in terms of the physics phenomena involved . to build a foundational construction straightforwardly",
    ", one should identify some real or possible stationary objects with euclidean points so that the appropriate constants of motion can approximate the values of the one - point vector field @xmath26 in eq .",
    ", two - point scalar field known as distance ( euclidean length ) etc .",
    "the well - known manifestations of quantization preclude implementing such a construction at sufficiently small scales.@xcite as a result , nor eqs .   nor eqs .",
    "appear applicable at those scales .",
    "nevertheless , to construct euclidean geometry ( or , at least , some pregeometry ) one could still adopt the motions of the interacting particles as primitive notions described with a set of experimentally identifiable relations between them .",
    "the formulation of such relations ( which would then make a low - level automatics of mechanics ) is far from the goals of this text , but there is hardly any doubt that the set of motions of interacting particles is sufficiently rich to support euclidean geometry and , therefore , the concept of a frame . at this logical level ,",
    "the relations that underlie euclidean geometry are not separable from those that eventually give rise to the existence of the constants of motion .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , within the familiar high - level formalism the concept of a frame manifests itself by means of a position vector @xmath5 , euclidean nature of which is most likely secured by non - relativistic classical physics .",
    "at least one connection between frames and regularities of classical physics reveals itself in terms of a position vector : eqs .",
    "keep their form when one changes a frame b for a frame a in accordance with the transformation rule @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath16 are given parameters . here and hereinafter the superscript ( f ) indicates that a quantity @xmath30 is initially defined in a frame f. ( but as far as the transformation is valid between any pair of frames , one can actually define a position vector @xmath5 in any frame . )    from the early days of the relativity theory , the following generalization of the above statement is regarded as a more or less universal principle , called the principle of relativity : the mutual disposition and the relative translational uniform rectilinear motion of two frames can not manifest itself in the description of physical phenomena within one of these frames .",
    "equivalently , physical laws have the same formulations in different ( necessarily non - accelerated non - rotating ) frames.@xcite    in the context of newtonian mechanics , the meaning of the relativity principle is plain : translational uniform rectilinear motion of a physical system as a whole with respect to some external ( reference ) bodies does not affect the motion of the internal parts of the system with respect to each other .",
    "however , this idea presumes a partition of the physical system that can not be seamlessly extended to include electromagnetic phenomena since the decomposition of an electromagnetic field into non - interfering components is possible only without electric charges .",
    "this apparent gap is accompanied ( and aggravated ) by the fact that the transformation does not preserve the form of source - free maxwell s equations .",
    "naturally , an attempt to derive the general transformation that keeps the full formalism of maxwellian electrodynamics would lead a researcher to a complicated problem .",
    "so the developers of the special relativity theory can not but begin with the simple coordinate transformation known as ( the original form of ) lorentz transformation ( which , in accordance with the purpose and logic of this article , is explicitly reproduced as late as in section [ lorentz transformation ] . )",
    "looking into early presentations of the special relativity theory , one can identify the following physics premise for the formal derivation of lorentz transformation : the law of motion of a free particle and the laws of propagation of a free electromagnetic field have the same form in all frames.@xcite to be exact , in an arbitrary frame f the position @xmath31 of a free particle is changing along with the time @xmath32 as @xmath33 while the positions @xmath34 taken by an electromagnetic wavefront ( wave phase - front ) at the time @xmath32 from a point source flashed at the position @xmath35 at the time @xmath36 satisfy @xmath37 the propagation speed @xmath0 of an electromagnetic spherical wavefront is the same in all frames . as long as the goals of one s inference are limited by the derivation of rules equivalent to those of lorentz transformation , one can confine oneself with the limiting form of eq .   for an infinitely far source position , i.e. the equation @xmath38 for a plane wavefront which propagates in the direction of the unit vector @xmath39 .",
    "one can view the above statements as a partial realization of einstein s original intention to extend the principle of relativity to electromagnetic phenomena .",
    "meanwhile , the next generation of authors has dispensed with both maxwell equations and eq .   in their introductions to the relativity theory . in the post - einsteinian derivations of the transformation rules between two frames",
    "one finds the principle of relativity replaced by the requirement to preserve the form of eq .",
    "supplemented with the condition @xmath40 to include `` the motion of a light signal '' ( in effect , the propagation of the intersection point of an electromagnetic plane wavefront with one of its associated ray paths.)@xcite as a result , the physics that underlies einstein s special relativity theory has been reduced to that of free point particles with the universal limitation on their speed , equal to @xmath0 in all frames .",
    "the use of free particles in a reasoning is evidently restricted by the processes of particles interaction .",
    "but as long as one neglects the extention and the duration of those processes , one can exploit an interaction act as a representation of a basic identifiable entity usually referred to as an event . in other words , each event appears to be real or possible interception of two ( or more ) free particles .",
    "then one can exploit experimentally identifiable relations between motions of free particles to establish relations between events .",
    "if need , the interaction between particles can be assumed so small as not to change their motion .",
    "( in general , one need exploiting eq .   for the motion of each particle @xmath7 between the points of interception , where the parameters @xmath41 may change .",
    ") this technique along with the basic appliance of the relativity principle is a main tool used in the next section .",
    "here it is also worth noting that the free motion of particles and the propagation of light rays are not sufficient to construct euclidean geometry , so the attempts to extend its validity to arbitrarily fast processes could end up with nothing but a new postulate.@xcite in order to have material carriers of euclidean geometry , presentations of the relativity theory have no choice but to borrow frames from newtonian mechanics .",
    "when someone applies newton s second law to a physical system which consists of weakly interacting ( e.g. , widely separated ) parts , he might think that newtonian mechanics should involve some means to identify motions in such parts as simultaneous processes . actually , eqs .   are well known to have originated from the regularities [ position evolution ] revealed by experiments / observations related to strongly interacting physical bodies , especially gravitationally bound ones , such as sun and planets .",
    "but in such a system , the existence of the time @xmath21 is an inherent property of its ( almost periodic or quasi - periodic ) motion . if @xmath42 is a characteristic speed of such motion , then for a given timescale @xmath43 it secures synchronization in changing physical quantities over the region of size @xmath44 .",
    "however , the special relativity theory implies the speed of light @xmath0 as a characteristic speed and , therefore , considers the region of size @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , within the special relativity theory , newtonian mechanics can secure the synchronization two processes ( `` clocks '' ) but only at one spatial point .    exploiting eq .  /eq .   or the light rays only ( without specifying geometrical structures prematurely ) one can synchronize events happened to particles at different positions ( as far as one neglects the time delay and the position shift due to interaction of a charged particle and electromagnetic field . ) this turns the time moment @xmath21 into a global variable , similar to a spatial coordinate .    in principle , within sufficiently small timescales",
    ", newtonian mechanics can maintain euclidean geometry only in the vicinity of each event , which means that the geometry of the subset @xmath46const might be riemannian.@xcite in this text , the global geometry of particles positions within each frame is still assumed euclidean , since it is appropriate for usual practical applications of the special relativity theory as well as common teaching curricula .",
    "for any pair of frames a and b , there are the velocity @xmath47 of a with respect to b and , vice versa , the velocity @xmath29 .",
    "since each of these vectors is defined as a spatial object in its own frame , there can be no procedure of comparing them directly on the basis of newtonian mechanics . nevertheless ,",
    "since all frames are supposed to be identical in their essential internal properties , one should accept @xmath48 denote a process that starts with an event @xmath49 and ends with an event @xmath50 , and let a number @xmath51 denote the elapsed time in an arbitrary frame f , so that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "if in the frame a one has @xmath54 for arbitrary events @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , then in the frame b one finds the same equality @xmath57 because the contrary would allow one to judge about the motion of b with respect to a on the basis of internal data in b , in contradiction with the principle of relativity .",
    "further generalization is possible if one exploits eq .   to partition a process into a series of shorter processes over even intervals of time : @xmath58 entails @xmath59 for any natural , rational and , finally , real @xmath60 .",
    "it follows that for any frame f the relation @xmath61 shows no dependence on the frame while for any process @xmath62 the relation @xmath63 depends only on @xmath42 defined by eq .  .",

    ", one can get an expression @xmath68 for the velocity @xmath69 of the body @xmath65 in the frame f where @xmath70 is actually independent of f in accordance with the previous analysis .",
    ".   allows one to define a one - parametric family of frames @xmath71 $ ] where @xmath65 is at rest while the bodies @xmath7 and @xmath11 move along the common straight line in opposite directions .",

    "@xmath77 $ ] , one can find that @xmath76 moves just along the boost line of @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath77 $ ] is an arbitrary member of the helicoboost class and @xmath76 can represent an arbitrary point body ( or even a light signal ) that moves along the boost line in @xmath77 $ ] , the boost lines in different frames of one helicoboost class prove equivalent in a sense : any point bodies that stay ( moving or resting ) on the boost line in one frame of a given helicoboost class remain ( moving or resting ) on the boost line in another frame of the same helicoboost class .",
    "if , in addition to the bodies @xmath7 and @xmath11 , one chooses more representatives of the frames a and b , one gets more parallel boost lines . to avoid specifying particular boost lines in a reasoning",
    ", one can invoke the direction of @xmath78 or @xmath79 , which represents a bundle of parallel boost lines in each member g of the helicoboost class .",
    "hereinafter this direction is referred to as a boost direction .",
    "it is possible to define both a boost direction and a helicoboost class of frames without prior reference to its two members : if there are a frame where a set of free point bodies have their velocities parallel or antiparallel to each other , then there are other frames where velocities of the these bodies are also parallel or anti - parallel to each other ; an equivalence class of such frames is a helicoboost class ; the direction of motion of such free bodies in each frame of the helicoboost class is a boost direction .",
    "the motion of light signals along the boost direction in one frame of a given helicoboost class is an important limiting case of the motions considered in the previous section .",
    "since the light signals represent the propagation of electromagnetic plane wavefronts , one can conclude that they propagate along the boost direction in any frame of the helicoboost class .",
    "it follows that simultaneous events in a plane perpendicular to the boost direction in one frame appear simultaneous in any other frame of the same helicoboost class , where they also occupy a plane perpendicular to the boost direction .",
    "let the locations of the above simultaneous events make a certain instantaneous arrangement over the plane wavefront . to represent it as a stationary geometric configuration",
    ", one should consider intersections some bundle of boost lines with a dense series of parallel wavefronts which propagate along the boost direction . since such wavefronts and",
    "the boost lines are observable in any frame of the helicoboost class , so is the stationary planar configuration they generate .",
    "the possibility of the common geometric configuration shows that the observers in different frames can come to agreement with each other about the orientation of their frames around the boost direction or , in other words , to another equivalence relation between two frames .",
    "this relation allows one to partition the helicoboost class into subclasses of identically oriented frames . in the following ,",
    "a subclass of this kind is referred to as a boost class .    to present the above equivalence relation in terms of a relative position vector",
    ", one can write : @xmath80 here and in the rest of the paper , the notation @xmath81 describes the decompositions of spatial vectors @xmath82 and @xmath83 in their respective frames .    since the symbol @xmath84 in eq .   denotes an arbitrary relative position vector , which connects two arbitrary points in a plane perpendicular to @xmath29",
    ", one can view eq .   as a notation for mapping a geometric configuration in the frame a to that in the frame b. to be accurate and limit onself by the use of spatial vectors only , without any explicit reference to the concept of euclidean points",

    "b these point bodies are at rest in a straight line along the boost direction . if in the frame a one has @xmath90 , then in the frame b one finds the correspondent equality @xmath91 due to the relativity principle . here",
    "the notation @xmath92 refers to a distance between moving bodies g and h momentarily observed in a frame a while @xmath93 denotes a distance between stationary bodies g and h in a frame b. if one exploits partitioning a line segment in a manner similar to the division of a time interval , one can eventually come to the similar conclusion that @xmath94 entails @xmath95 for any natural , rational and , finally , real @xmath60 .",
    "it follows that for any frame f of the boost class the relation @xmath96 shows no dependence on the frame while for any pair of bodies p and q stationary in the frame b the relation @xmath97 depends only on @xmath42 .",
    "the application of the above result is not bounded by a comparison of the distances between two bodies in the two frames .",
    "in fact , the distance @xmath98 between two moving point bodies in the frame a is a distance between two _ simultaneous _ events of detecting these bodies in the frame a. in the frame b , these events are not necessarily simultaneous but happening to the same bodies .",
    "so the distance @xmath99 between the bodies is a distance between the events , too .",
    "thus , the relation @xmath100 is the same for any pair of events in the straight line along the boost direction , provided that they are simultaneous in the frame a.    let simultaneous elementary events in the frame a occur over the length @xmath101 in a straight line along the boost direction , i.e. along the direction of motion of the frame b. physically , they together may be an act of detecting a rigid rod embedded into the frame a. if a flashlight occurs in the middle of the rod , it takes the same time interval @xmath102 for that light to get to each end of the rod .",
    "when instantaneously observed in the frame b , the length of the rod appears to be @xmath103 .",
    "the arrivals of the above mentioned flashlight at the ends of the moving rod are not simultaneous in the frame b : along the direction of the rod s motion the time difference makes @xmath104 while the distance between these events is @xmath105 here and hereafter @xmath106 .    the equations and take account of the possibility that in different frames a set of the same events may occupy segments of different sizes along their boost direction .",

    "this means that eq .   and",
    "eq .   together entail the time dilation effect @xmath115 which gives the laboratory time interval @xmath43 between two events at a moving point during its given proper time interval @xmath116 .    to show relations between the spatiotemporal effects of the relativity theory in one s practice of teaching",

    "the seemingly key formula appears to be nothing but a relation between two representations and for one relative motion , of which the formal simplicity of may even be misleading :    when asked about the direction of the @xmath168-axis , someone may correctly infer from that it is the direction of the @xmath169-axis instantaneously observed in the coordinate system a. but the problem is that a researcher must be able to identify any directions before establishing / verifying ( theoretically / experimentally ) the relationships . to avoid that apparent logical circle",
    ", one might take the above description of the direction as a definition and an explicit starting point in a derivation of the transformation rule .",
    "needless to say that such an accurate approach can hardly be found in the existing , history - oriented , presentations of the relativity theory .",
    "now the coordinate - free description for the relation between two arbitrary frames in section [ transformation ] allows one to formulate logically consistent and physically explicit definition of a boost coordinate transformation .      aside from the origins , the above",

    ", @xmath175 makes the same angles with @xmath171 in the frame b as @xmath29 does with @xmath170 in the frame a. then , by definition , the boost is the transformation of time along with the transformation of coordinates of an event between the coordinate systems satisfying the conditions and .",
    "the equivalence relations and along with the property yield the equality of numbers @xmath176 eqs .   and allows one to rewrite the dot products as @xmath177 and @xmath178 here the common pithy notation is used : @xmath179 while the repeated index @xmath180 implies the summation over all its values .",

    "one can address the definition of a boost in the previous section so as to come to physically meaningful conclusions directly .",

[ moving vector ] . )",
    "sometimes it may be reasonable to change the laboratory coordinate system with the aid of the boost transformation so as to reach simpler state of motion , to reduce the form of interaction law etc .",
    "then , in the limit @xmath195 , the angle @xmath196 shows what relative error is not properly compensated in case one fails to transform all relevant quantities appropriately .",
    "a boost direction for a pair of inertial reference frames is that spatial direction in one of the frames along which the other frame moves .",
    "free motions of point particles make an instrumentation for identifying the boost direction as well as events on a straight line along that direction .",
    "the concept of a boost direction secures the formulation of the basic relativity effects in a physics - based manner , which , eventually , results in the relation between two arbitrary frames in terms of their position vectors and time moments for a given event .",
    "within the physics - based approach , addressing the transformation of coordinates implies specifying some coordinate systems in each frame in terms of physical objects / directions .",

    "in particular , for a cartesian coordinate system subjected to a boost coordinate transformation , the coordinate - free technique of reasoning allows one to evaluate its instantaneously observable apparent distortion easily .",
    "since both electromagnetism and gravity manifest themselves via the concept of force , they allow one to distinguish directions and thereby support projective geometry at least . the next step should involve point particles , i.e. such entities that can strongly interact over a sufficiently short range .",
    "then the application of first newton s law to several particles on the same straight line helps one identify stationary particles , which can embody euclidean points .",

    "in general , the elementary charge @xmath197 , plank s constant @xmath198 , electron s rest mass @xmath199 , proton s rest mass @xmath200 are well known magnitudes which reveal the quantization of electric charge , angular momentum and mass / energy , respectively .",

    "the use of the cgs system of units is assumed , so one can take @xmath0 as a parameter in maxwell equations , not necessarily the observable speed of light .",
    "though no formal analysis of applicability of euclidean geometry has yet been published , it is over scales less than compton wavelength of electron where some authors have found it difficult to provide a consistent concept of a spatial coordinate . see p.  40 in ref .   and p.  2 in ref .",
    "for simple order - of - magnitude considerations and , e.g. , ref .   for the exemplars of existing theoretical approach to the problem .",
    "the thought that first newton s law has the same form in all inertial frames was viewed as trivial and , for this reason , exploited implicitly ( until the accurate presentation in ref .   has appeared . ) in contrast , einstein s idea that electromagnetic phenomena , such as the propagation of a spherical wave , was apparently perceived as nontrivial .",
    "so the statement that a spherical wavefront keeps its form in all frames appeared to be a popular explicit premise for the derivation of lorentz transformation ; see , e.g. , p.  100 in ref .   and",
    "p.  9 in ref .   .",
    "this is just the condition in the equations ( 8.05 ) and ( 8.06 ) at p.  21 in ref .  .",
    "interestingly , fock starts his consideration with the general wavefront equation , which , in principle , can describe non - spherical wavefronts , e.g. , from two interfering point sources .",
    "but eventually he has narrowed his inference with no explicit reasoning .",

    "this is an impicit reason why fock@xcite starts his inference of a boost with a generally nonlinear transformation of the space and time variables and addresses some concepts of riemannian geometry as elements of a suitable notation ."
