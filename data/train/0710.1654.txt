    "the rayleigh - jeans portion of the dust spectral energy distribution ( sed ) produces a strong negative @xmath3-correction and makes the observed submillimeter flux of a dusty galaxy almost invariant at @xmath4 to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this makes the submillimeter wavelength a potentially powerful probe to the high - redshift universe .",
    "however , to date , all the identified submillimeter galaxies are at redshifts lower than 4 , likely because of the limited resolution of current submillimeter instruments and the limited sensitivity of current radio instruments .",
    "the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the single - dish james clerk maxwell telescope resolved 20%30% of the submillimeter extragalactic background light into point sources brighter than @xmath6 mjy at 850 @xmath0 m ( @xcite ) . because of the low resolution ( @xmath7 ) of scuba , identifications of the submillimeter sources have to assume the radio  fir correlation in local galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and rely on radio interferometry to pinpoint the location of the submillimeter emission .",
    "optical spectroscopy of radio identified submillimeter sources shows that they are ultraluminous ( @xmath8 @xmath9 , corresponding to star formation rates of @xmath10@xmath11 @xmath12 yr@xmath13 ) sources at @xmath143 and that they dominate the total star formation at this redshift @xcite .",
    "however , the positive @xmath3-correction of the radio synchrotron emission makes the radio wavelength insensitive to high - redshift galaxies , and radio observations can only identify 60%70% of the blank - field submillimeter sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radio unidentified submillimeter sources are commonly thought to be at redshifts higher than the radio detection limit ( typically @xmath154 ) but there is no direct evidence for such a high - redshift radio - faint submillimeter population .    with recent development in submillimeter interferometry",
    ", it is now possible to locate submillimeter sources directly without relying on radio observations .",
    "we have begun a program to target radio - faint submillimeter sources with the submillimeter array ( sma ) to determine whether there is a high - redshift ( @xmath2 ) tail in the redshift distribution of the submillimeter sources . here",
    "we report our first identification in this program , goods 850 - 5 .",
    "goods 850 - 5 was detected by our scuba jiggle - map survey in the great observatories origins deep surveys - north ( goods - n , @xcite ) with an 850 @xmath0 m flux of @xmath16 mjy @xcite .",
    "it was also detected in the combined jiggle and scan map of goods - n ( gn 10 , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is the second brightest submillimeter source in our jiggle - map catalog of the goods - n and has an ir luminosity of @xmath17 @xmath9 .",
    "it does not have a @xmath18 radio counterpart in the deep very large array ( vla ) 1.4 ghz catalogs of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "this is important evidence for the existence of high - redshift submillimeter sources . in this letter ,",
    "we report the sma observation and the multiwavelength photometry (   [ observation ] ) and the redshift constraints derived from the photometric data (   [ z_constraints ] ) .",

    "a full track of sma observations were obtained on 2007 january 23 using eight antennas in the compact configuration .",
    "the receivers were tuned to a frequency of 345.0 ghz centered in the upper sideband , yielding 335.0 ghz in the lower sideband .",
    "each sideband covers a 2 ghz bandwidth and contains 768 spectral channels .",
    "the tracking center is at the scuba position of goods 850 - 5 ( @xmath22 = \\rm 12^h 36^m 33^s.45 $ ] , @xmath23=62\\arcdeg 14\\arcmin 09\\farcs43 $ ] ) .",
    "callisto and the bright quasar 3c84 were observed to provide flux and bandpass calibrations , respectively .",
    "quasars 1419 + 543 and 1048 + 717 , respectively @xmath24 and @xmath25 away from the target , were observed after every 15 minutes of on - target integration for time - dependent complex gain calibrations .",
    "the 225 ghz opacity was an excellent 0.030.06 , and the dual - sideband system temperature averaged over the entire track was 188 k.    the calibration and data inspection were performed with the caltech package mir , modified for the sma .",
    "continuum data were generated by averaging the spectral channels after the passband calibration .",
    "both gain calibrators were used to derive gain curves .",
    "however , we carried out a separate reduction in which the primary calibrator 1048 + 717 was used to calibrate 1419 + 543 .",
    "the reduced image of 1419 + 543 has a point source @xmath26 away from the phase center .",
    "since the two calibrators are separated by a large @xmath27 on the sky , this offset should be only considered as an upper limit to the astrometry error in the reduced image of goods 850 - 5 .",
    "the calibrated visibility data were fourier transformed and deconvolved in the package miriad to form images . in the transformation , we weighted each visibility point inversely proportional to the system temperature .",
    "combined with a natural weighting , this provides an optimum s / n and a synthesized beam fwhm of @xmath28 at a position angle of @xmath29 . in the dirty image of goods 850 - 5 , a point source is apparent and we restricted the clean deconvolution to a @xmath30 region centered at the point source .",
    "there is no sign of other sources both in the dirty and cleaned images .",
    "the noise level in the cleaned image is 1.4 mjy beam@xmath13 .",
    "a point source of @xmath31 mjy is clearly detected very close to the phase center .",
    "a gaussian fit to the image yields a source profile identical to the synthesized beam , indicating an unresolved source with good calibrations .",
    "the fit provides a source position of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , which agrees extremely well with the scuba position .",
    "the positional error in the fit is @xmath34 , consistent with the angular resolution for this s / n and also comparable to the aforementioned upper limit to the astrometry error derived from the calibrator 1419 + 543 .",
    "we also performed a point - source fit directly to the visibility data , and the result is fully consistent with the fit in the image plane .",
    "we present the goods _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images @xcite , our cfht wircam @xmath35 band image ( 36 hours of integration , keenan et al .",

[ thumbnail ] . in all of the four acs images ( f435w , f606w , f775w , and f850lp ) and the wircam image , there are no galaxies within @xmath36 from the sma position .",
    "a faint galaxy is clearly detected by _ spitzer _ in all four irac bands and in the 24 @xmath0 m mips band right at the sma position .",
    "because of the high accuracy ( @xmath34 ) of the sma astrometry , this _",
    "spitzer _ source is a robust identification of goods 850 - 5 .",
    "we list our broadband fluxes in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the 850 @xmath0 m flux is a noise weighted mean from the scuba jiggle map ( wang et al .",
    "2004 ) and the sma measurement .",
    "typical errors in flux calibrations at this wavelength are @xmath37 and could be larger than the noise .",
    "however , the fact that the sma flux and the scuba flux agree with each other extremely well suggests good flux calibrations in both experiments .",
    "the 1.4 ghz flux is measured at the sma position from the vla image of @xcite , assuming a point source and with a primary beam correction .",
    "the acs and wircam fluxes are also measured at the sma position with respectively @xmath38 and @xmath39 diameter apertures .",
    "measuring fluxes in the _ spitzer _ bands is more difficult . in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m images",
    ", there is a nearby blue galaxy blended with goods 850 - 5 .",
    "there is another galaxy blended with goods 850 - 5 in the mips image . to deconvolve the fluxes , we performed psf fitting to the blended sources .",
    "we used the irac and mips in - flight psfs and applied simultaneous two - component fits to the two sources , and scaled the measured fluxes to total fluxes using the psfs . to verify the fluxes measured in this way , we first compared them with simple aperture - corrected aperture fluxes .",
    "we found that at 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m where goods 850 - 5 is isolated , the psf fitting provides fluxes consistent with the aperture fluxes .",
    "we also used the sextractor package @xcite to measure fluxes .",
    "sextractor could deblend the two sources at 4.5 @xmath0 m but not at 3.6 @xmath0 m even with the most aggressive deblending .",
    "the aperture corrected sextractor fluxes at @xmath40 @xmath0 m and longer are all consistent with the psf fitting fluxes .",
    "we thus conclude that our psf fitting provides reliable estimates of the fluxes of goods 850 - 5 .",

    "goods 850 - 5 , one of the brightest 850 @xmath0 m sources in the goods - n , is incredibly faint at _ all _ other wavelengths . because of the optical and near - ir faintness , it is difficult to obtain its redshift through spectroscopy .",
    "we obtained redshift constraints for goods 850 - 5 using the multiwavelength broadband fluxes .",
    "there are three independent pieces of evidence that suggest goods 850 - 5 is a @xmath2 galaxy .    by assuming that the well known radio  fir correlation for local star forming galaxies also applies to submillimeter sources , we can estimate the redshift using the radio and submillimeter fluxes ( e.g. , @xcite ; barger et al .",
    "barger et al .  assumed pure power - law seds in both the radio and the submillimeter and obtained the formula @xmath42 , based on arp 220 .",
    "this implies @xmath43 for goods 850 - 5 . this is a lower limit , because the peak of the dust sed and the free - free emission start to move in the observed bands at @xmath2 .",
    "both effects underestimate the redshift . by adopting the complete arp 220 sed model in @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath44 for goods 850 - 5",
    "( @xmath43 if we adopt the radio flux of 33.1 @xmath0jy in @xcite ) .",
    "this redshift estimate is nevertheless very crude . because of the uncertainties in the submillimeter and radio seds and the radio  fir correlation at high redshift",
    ", such redshift estimates typically have an error of @xmath45 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the unusually large @xmath46 ratio also suggests a high redshift of @xmath47 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ 850_24_z ] , the @xmath46 ratio of goods 850 - 5 is an order of magnitude higher than the mean value for other identified submillimeter sources in the goods - n .",
    "this can only be explained by a @xmath47 galaxy with any dust seds allowed by current models .",
    "finally , we used the photometric redshift technique to test if the _ hst _ , wircam , and _ spitzer _ sed of goods 850 - 5 can be fitted with a @xmath2 galaxy . because there is not a unique correlation between the dust sed and stellar sed of galaxies",
    ", we only included the acs , wircam , and irac passbands in the photometric redshift study to account for just the stellar emission .",
    "although goods 850 - 5 is not detected in the acs images , the upper limits to the acs fluxes suggest a very red sed at @xmath48 @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ zphot ] ) and thus still provide useful constraints . in the photometric redshift fitting , we assigned zeros to the acs fluxes and used the 1 @xmath1 errors as the flux uncertainties .",
    "we used the measured @xmath35 flux , even though it is only 1 @xmath1 .",
    "we used the popular hyperz package @xcite .",
    "we limited the redshift range to @xmath4912 and adopted the @xcite extinction of @xmath505 .",
    "we used two sets of seds .",
    "the first set consists of empirically observed seds , including the i m , scd , sbc , and e type galaxies in coleman et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and the starburst seds sb2 and sb3 in @xcite .",
    "the primary solution provided by hyperz is @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and a sbc type galaxy .",
    "the corresponding probability is 65.1% , and the 99% confidence range is @xmath538.0 .",
    "the second sed set is the stellar population synthesis models included in hyperz , which is based on the earlier version of @xcite .",
    "the primary solution is @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and a burst type sed with an age of 0.5 gyr .",
    "the corresponding probability is 96.4% , and the 99% confidence range is @xmath568.0 . in both sed sets ,",
    "the photometric redshift confidence range is consistent with the range allowed by the radio , submillimeter , and mid - ir flux ratios discussed above . in fig .",
    "[ zphot ] we show the fitted and observed seds , and the best - fit @xmath57 , probability , and extinction as functions of redshift .",
    "the sed can only be fitted with @xmath58 at @xmath59 and the probabilities at @xmath59 of the best - fit models are zero even when @xmath60 is allowed in the fitting .",
    "therefore , a highly reddened galaxy at @xmath59 is ruled out for goods 850 - 5 . in the photometric redshift",
    "fitting , an intermediate redshift of 34.5 is not entirely ruled out , although the probability is low ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the primary uncertainty in the above analyses is the possibility of the existence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , whose sed may be different then the ones used for the radio , submillimeter , ir , and optical photometric analyses .",
    "we argue that whether or not there is an agn is not likely to change the high redshift of goods 850 - 5 .",
    "first , goods 850 - 5 is not detected in the 2 ms _ chandra _ images @xcite in either the hard or soft x - ray bands .",
    "this rules out a compton - thin agn at @xmath59 .",
    "( the 2 ms _ chandra _ observations can detect a @xmath62 and @xmath63 erg s@xmath13 soft and hard x - ray source , respectively , at @xmath15 . ) the best example of a local compton - thick agn in the far - ir luminosity class of goods 850 - 5 is mrk 231 . although the irac power - law spectral slope of goods 850 - 5 is similar to that of mrk 231 , its @xmath64 flux ratio is more than an order of magnitude higher than mrk 231 at @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ 850_24_z ] ) , i.e. , goods 850 - 5 does not show much of the warm dust emission that is characteristic for a heavily obscured agn .",
    "furthermore , the rest - frame 1.4 ghz flux of mrk 231 also follows the radio  fir correlation for normal galaxies with a @xmath65 value of 2.24 ( under the definition of @xmath65 in @xcite ) but it has a flat radio spectrum ( a smaller @xmath3-correction in the radio ) .",
    "therefore , even if goods 850 - 5 is an agn that is similar to mrk 231 , its large @xmath66 flux ratio will suggest a redshift even higher than that estimated from the arp 220 template .",
    "there is growing evidence for a signification submillimeter population at @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite presented evidence for an optically faint @xmath67 galaxy for hdf 850.1 .",
    "more recent sma results of @xcite suggest a number of radio and optically faint submillimeter sources to be at @xmath68 .",
    "goods 850 - 5 is similar to these galaxies . on the other hand , goods 850 - 5 has the highest @xmath69 flux ratio , and also has higher quality data at many other wavelengths . unlike hdf 850.1 , which is behind a bright galaxy , goods 850 - 5 can be studied in details especially in the optical and ir wavelengths .",
    "the discovery of goods 850 - 5 and its like extends the redshift distribution of bright submillimeter sources to beyond 4.0 , and perhaps even to @xmath70 .",
    "the 12.3 mjy 850 @xmath0 m flux of goods 850 - 5 implies an ir luminosity of @xmath71 @xmath9 ( @xmath72mjy , @xcite ) , and therefore a very high star formation rate of @xmath73 @xmath12 yr@xmath13 ( @xmath74 , @xcite ) .",
    "this is an extraordinary amount of star formation at high redshift but it can only be identified in the submillimeter .",
    "even if such a source could be picked up in optical and near - ir broadband dropout surveys , its star formation would still be missed due to the extreme faintness in the rest - frame uv .",
    "how much can hidden sources like this affect the current picture of the cosmic star formation history at high redshift ?",
    "bright submillimeter sources ( @xmath75 mjy at 850 @xmath0 m ) contribute @xmath76 jy deg@xmath77 to the total background , and 60% to 70% of them have radio counterparts .",
    "we assume that all of the @xmath78 jy deg@xmath77 radio - unidentified bright submillimeter sources are at @xmath797 . with the above conversions between 850 @xmath0 m flux , ir luminosity , and star formation rate ,",
    "this implies a mean comoving ir luminosity density of @xmath80 @xmath9 mpc@xmath81 , and therefore a star formation rate density ( sfrd ) of @xmath82 @xmath12 yr@xmath13 mpc@xmath81 .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate in barger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) based on a smaller sample of radio unidentified submillimeter sources , after taking into account the differences in cosmology .",
    "our value of 0.04 @xmath12 yr@xmath13 mpc@xmath81 _ averaged over _ @xmath797 is @xmath83 higher than the typical value of 0.010.02 @xmath12 yr@xmath13 mpc@xmath81 _ at _ @xmath84 determined from optical surveys without extinction correction ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general ,",
    "lyman - break galaxies are not bright submillimeter sources @xcite , suggesting that most ( if not all ) of the above sfrd estimated from the radio - unidentified bright submillimeter sources is missed by optical surveys .",
    "although our sfrd of 0.04 @xmath12 yr@xmath13 mpc@xmath81 is likely an upper limit due to the assumptions , it still shows the significance of dust hidden star formation at high redshift .",
    "we obtained accurate astrometry for the bright submillimeter source goods 850 - 5 with the sma interferometer at 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "the counterpart is extremely faint in the optical , near - ir , mid - ir , and radio .",
    "both the radio and 24 @xmath0 m faintness of goods 850 - 5 suggests a high redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "the very red sed between 3.6 and 8.0 @xmath0 m and the nondetection in the optical and @xmath35 bands can only be fitted by stellar continuum at @xmath2 .",
    "this discovery provides important evidence that some of the radio undetected submillimeter sources are at high redshift and extends the redshift distribution of bright submillimeter sources to @xmath2 .",
    "it suggests that a great fraction of star formation at high redshift is hidden from optical surveys .",
