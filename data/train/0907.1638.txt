    "it has been known for some time that negative energy densities and fluxes are a generic prediction of quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "states which involve negative energy , such as the casimir vacuum state and squeezed states of light , have even been produced in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "negative energy density may be viewed as an example of a sub - vacuum phenomenon , whereby the vacuum fluctuations are suppressed below their level in the minkowski vacuum state . the experiments which have been done measure an indirect effect , such as a casimir force or a change in photon counting statistics , not the energy density itself .",
    "this raises the question of whether more direct detection of negative energy density or related effects is possible .",
    "the gravitational effects are far too small to be feasible in a laboratory experiment .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude and duration of negative energy densities and fluxes are constrained by quantum inequalities  @xcite .",
    "these are constraints derivable directly from quantum field theory , which yield an inverse relation between the magnitude of the negative energy density and its duration .",
    "marecki  @xcite proved quantum inequality - type bounds on the magnitude and duration of squeezing in quantum optics experiments involving squeezed states of light .",
    "these constraints make the search for local measurements of sub - vacuum effects more challenging .",
    "nonetheless , there seems to be no barrier in principle to constructing a negative energy detector which relies solely upon electromagnetic interactions .",
    "one model for such a detector was proposed by ford , grove , and ottewill  @xcite , who analyzed a system of atomic spins , placed in an external magnetic field and coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field . when the system is coupled to a non - classical state of photons , such as a squeezed vacuum state",
    ", there can be a transient increase in the average magnetic moment , as compared to when the quantized field is in the vacuum state .",
    "this can be viewed as a suppression of a depolarizing effect of vacuum fluctuations on the spins , resulting in momentary `` re - polarization '' . in general , this change is not directly correlated with energy density . however , for a certain ranges of parameters of the system , the change in magnetic moment is in phase with the periods of negative energy density . under these circumstances ,",
    "this spin system represents a non - gravitational negative energy detector .",
    "unfortunately , the fractional change in the mean magnetic moment is quite small unless the photon energies approach the @xmath0-ray range .",
    "consequently , it is questionable that one could find a way to detect the extremely rapid changes in the mean magnetic moment .",
    "other models have been treated by davies and ottewill  @xcite , who studied the detection of negative energy fluxes using various types of switched monopole particle detectors , building on earlier work by grove  @xcite .",
    "marecki and szpak @xcite modeled spontaneous light emission from two - level atoms coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "they derived a volterra - type equation which controls the time evolution of the amplitude of the excited state .    in this paper , we follow the spirit of these earlier works and look for an indirect `` tracker '' which might lead to the detection of negative energy or vacuum fluctuation suppression - type effects .",
    "it is well - known that electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations are essential for the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms . without the coupling to the quantized radiation field , all energy levels of an atom would be eigenstates of the hamiltonian , and hence stable .",
    "this suggests that a suppression of the usual vacuum fluctuations could increase the lifetime of an excited state in a way which might be observable .",
    "we consider a model of a two - level excited atom interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field , using first - order perturbation theory .",
    "the field is confined to a closed cavity with two of its dimensions much larger than the other one .",
    "this is so that we can arrange the transit time of the atom through the cavity to be small compared to the light travel time across the larger two dimensions of the cavity .",
    "our idea is to prepare the cavity field in a non - classical state , such as a squeezed vacuum , and fire the excited atom through the cavity along its shortest dimension , before the state of the field has time to change very much .",
    "we want the atom to interact with the field during the period when the renormalized expectation value of the square of the electric field , @xmath1 , is negative .",
    "the purpose is to see whether this will suppress the de - excitation probability of the atom , compared to its vacuum value , in a way that will be correlated with the periods of @xmath2 .",
    "if so , our system would function as a negative @xmath3 detector .",
    "we work primarily with cavity modes , for which @xmath4 , so periods of @xmath2 do not generally correspond to periods of negative energy density",
    ". however , under certain conditions , our model will also serve to measure the energy density .    for most treatments of this type in quantum optics , the jaynes - cummings model for the interaction between the atom and the field is used .",
    "this model makes use of the rotating wave approximation , which effectively ignores terms with rapidly oscillating exponentials  @xcite .",
    "we explicitly do not make this approximation , because the effects we are interested in are highly transient ones , and depend on these terms .",
    "it also should be mentioned that any scheme which is designed so that a particle or observer interacts only with negative energy in flat spacetime can be ruled out by the quantum inequalities and the averaged weak energy condition , which is known to hold in minkowski spacetime . in a realistic version of our atom - cavity system",
    ", the atom would have to pass through holes cut in the cavity walls . even in the event that the atom passed through net negative energy while passing through the cavity",
    ", edge effects from the holes will contribute enough positive energy to satisfy the averaged weak energy condition .",
    "this effect has been discussed recently by graham and olum  @xcite , and by fewster , olum , and pfenning  @xcite .    in our case , we are comparing the de - excitation probability of the atom in an excited state of the cavity to when there is only vacuum in the cavity .",
    "in particular , we are interested in situations where this probability is suppressed relative to its vacuum value , and where the periods of suppression are in phase with periods of @xmath5 .",
    "we will be concerned with changes in @xmath1 or the energy density due to changes in the quantum state in the cavity . in this case",
    ", edge effects due to the holes in the cavity will cancel out .",
    "it is possible for the difference in the net energy seen by an observer to be negative , as was shown by borde , ford , and roman  @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will regard @xmath1 and the energy density as being set to zero in the vacuum state of the cavity .",
    "thus we are concerned only with changes due to changing the quantum state of the cavity , and not with casimir - type effects due to the geometry of the cavity .",
    "it is well known that the presence of boundaries can make the energy density or @xmath1 smaller than in empty space vacuum state . however ,",
    "this effect on decay rates of atoms is difficult to distinguish from the effects of the changes in mode structure , such as the change from a continuous to a discrete spectrum .",
    "the effects of cavity geometry on atomic decays has been extensively studied in recent decades , with an early treatment given by babiker and barton  @xcite . for a recent review ,",

    "we would ideally like the lifetime , @xmath203 , of the excited state to be roughly equal to the transit time of the atom across the cavity .",
    "for the rydberg atoms under consideration ( @xmath194 ) , @xmath204 sec .",
    "this would make @xmath205 of order unity and maximize the effect we are studying .",
    "let us consider the case of the vacuum plus two photon state discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec:0p2 ] .",
    "such a state might be created by a process which has a finite probability to emit a pair of photons into the lowest mode of the cavity .",
    "we have seen that in this state it is possible to have @xmath206 , so there is a significant reduction in the decay rate .",
    "the duration of the interval of negative mean squared electric field is , from the discussion at the end of sect .",
    "[ sec:0p2 ] , @xmath207 let us choose the smallest dimension of the cavity to be @xmath208 which easily satisfies criterion ( 4 ) .",
    "this requires that the speed of the atom be @xmath209 this can be satisfied by non - relativistic speeds compatible with criterion ( 6 ) .",
    "the one criterion listed above which can not be satisfied is ( 7 ) , as the atomic lifetime is necessarily long compared to the transit time .",
    "this means that each atom has a probability of less than @xmath210 of decaying while transiting the cavity .",
    "however , this need not be a serious problem if a sufficiently large flux of atoms can be used .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the effects of vacuum fluctuation suppression on the de - excitation probabilities of atoms .",
    "this suppression occurs in quantum states of the radiation field in which the renormalized expectation value of the square of the electric field operator is periodically negative .",
    "examples of such states include the vacuum plus two photon state and the single - mode squeezed vacuum state",
    ". both of these are examples of quantum states exhibiting sub - vacuum effects , such as negative energy density or negative mean squared electric field .",
    "we have treated a model detector which consists of an atom in an excited state traversing a cavity containing photons in a non - classical state .",
    "we calculated the ratio , @xmath211 , of the de - excitation probability in an arbitrary single - mode cavity field quantum state to the same probability in the vacuum state .",
    "this calculation assumed that the atom and field are near resonance , with the transition frequency approximately equal to the lowest cavity frequency , so that the atom had only one available decay mode .",
    "our results showed that near resonance , the ratio @xmath211 tracks @xmath1 .",
    "hence @xmath211 will have its minimum value when @xmath1 is maximally negative .",
    "in certain cases , this is also when the energy density is maximally negative .",
    "we also calculated the difference , @xmath212 , of the de - excitation probability between our arbitrary state and the vacuum state , where the effects of the non - excited modes would cancel out . in this case",
    "@xmath212 is proportional to @xmath1 far below resonance , but not in other cases .",
    "in particular , only when the lowest cavity mode frequency was much less than the transition frequency of the atom did we find that @xmath213 when @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", we were able to derive a quantum inequality lower bound on @xmath106 .",
    "finally , we discussed the plausibility of an experiment involving rydberg atoms to detect @xmath2 and possibly negative energy density .",
    "although challenging , such an experiment may be possible .",
    "we would like to thank ben varcoe for valuable discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science foundation under grants phy-0555754 and phy-0652904 .",
    "here we will derive a quantum inequality bound on the amount by which the de - excitation probability may be suppressed by quantum field effects . from eq .",

    "we can always choose the phases of the @xmath110 s so that the magnitude of the second term will be largest at @xmath215 .",
    "let us call the smallest possible value of the bracketed term @xmath216 , i.e. , @xmath217 following the argument given on p. 230 of ref.@xcite , we will prove that @xmath216 , and thus @xmath1 , are bounded from below . since @xmath216 also appears in our expressions , eq .",
