    "in a metallic system where both a first band @xmath9 and a second band @xmath10 , with no hybridization , cross the fermi level the pairing is described by a matrix where the diagonal elements are the intraband cooper pairing processes , namely , @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the non - diagonal elements , namely , @xmath8 that describes the interband pairing process associated with the transfer of pairs between the bands @xcite .",
    "today the open problem in condensed matter physics is the interband pairing where the standard bcs approximation that considers the fermi level far away form the energy of band edges or critical points breaks down .",
    "in fact where the chemical potential is tuned near an electronic topological transition the high temperature superconductivity has been associated with quantum interference effects , called shape resonances , in the interband pairing terms since 1993 @xcite .    the shape resonance in the superconducting gaps is realized by material design of superconducting hetero - structures at atomic limit made of superlattices of superconducting layers with a relevant transversal hopping between layers @xcite .",
    "the material architecture and the superlattice misfit strain @xcite are key terms for fine tuning the system to quantum critical points@xcite driven by electronic topological transitions .    at the time of discovery of high tc cuprates in 1986 ,",
    "these materials have been considered to be isotropic 3d perovskites but later it was recognized that all high temperature superconducting cuprates are made of a superlattice of atomic copper oxide layers intercalated by different spacers where the evolution of the complex electronic structure with chemical doping has remained mysterious for many years . the large majority of scientific community has interpreted the available unconventional experimental data in terms of an effective single band for high temperature superconducting models .",
    "few authors have interpreted the data in terms of mainly two non - hybridized bands and two fermi surfaces at the nodal and anti - nodal point of the band structure @xcite .",
    "this key point for the physics of cuprates has been recently accepted by the large scientific community in 2010 driven by compelling experimental data @xcite .",
    "later different practical realizations of superlattices of superconducting atomic layers intercalated by spacers tuned at a shape resonance @xcite have been found in 2001 in diborides @xcite and in 2008 in pnictides @xcite .    in these hetero - structures many experiments",
    "have provided experimental tests for multigap superconductivity in the clean limit also in the presence of many lattice impurities introduced to change the chemical potential and structural phase separation from nano - scale to micron - scale @xcite with the signatures of complexity of condensed matter near a quantum critical point . the key point for high temperature superconductivity",
    "is the presence of shape resonances in the interband pairing due to pair transfer between condensates with different topological symmetry due to quantum interference effects between pairing channel .",
    "this scenario has been discussed using simple electronic models @xcite .",
    "superconducting pnictides @xcite are made of stacks of iron fcc atomic layers intercalated by spacers with a superlattice architecture similar to cuprates @xcite that show multigap superconductivity @xcite with multiple bands crossing the fermi level @xcite .    while in diborides anomalous strong electron - phonon intraband interaction",
    "is quite relevant in two - band superconductivity scenario , in pnictides the intraband coupling is so small that has been neglected @xcite .",
    "in fact experimental findings show that the scenario where interband pairing is the dominant interaction , proposed by some of us in previous works @xcite , has now an experimental test .    here",
    "we investigate the case where the relative strength between the intraband and interband coupling is changing that is relevant for material design of novel high tc superconductors made of synthetic superlattices . in these systems the relevant region for high temperature superconductivity is where the chemical potential is tuned between the band edge of the second band and the electronic topological transition where the fermi surface of the second band changes from a 3d topology to a 2d topology with a corrugated cylindrical shape @xcite .",
    "therefore we focus in a system with two similar overlapping bands such that the first hole - like ( electron - like ) fermi surface coexists with a second electron - like ( hole - like ) fermi surface .",
    "the proposed model has the characteristic feature that for the occupation number of 1 electron per spin shows a critical point where the hole fermi surface is the same as the electron fermi surface ( like in pnictides @xcite ) therefore tuning the chemical potential at this point there is a strong nesting between the two fermi surfaces that determines a structural instability with a structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase @xcite .",
    "a scale invariant complex structure could appear in the proximity of this phase transition in pnictides @xcite as in cuprates @xcite .",
    "we study a band structure that can be realized in superlattices of fcc lattice like in iron based multilayer materials that have provided a particular realization of multiband superconductivity in the clean limit with a high critical temperature .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the point of view that both the interband and intraband scattering terms are indeed very important to explain the response of the superconducting phase to the variation of the chemical potential . on the other side",
    "the case of pnictides is considered to be the case where intraband coupling can be neglected as we have proposed in the previous work before the discovery of pnictides @xcite .",
    "now we focus our interest on the fact that it is important to consider different cases where both intra - band and interband pairing are relevant that will be relevant for novel synthetic superconducting superlattices .",
    "we consider the case where the interband pairing @xmath6 is as important as the intraband contributions , namely , @xmath11 . here",
    "we report the study of the variations of the critical temperature and gap ratio as a function of the charge density crossing electronic phase transitions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we present the four self - consistent equations : ( * 1 * ) two self - consistent equations ( eqs .",

    "we have evaluated the critical temperature for different charge densities and chemical potentials , tuning the superconducting system close to relevant energies for electronic topological transitions .",
    "the results indicate that both interband and intraband effective pairing are relevant in determining the properties of the superconducting phase and their sensibility to the variation of external parameters ( _ i.e. _ , density and chemical potential ) .",
    "interestingly , for fixed intraband pairing , and several different interband pairing , the critical temperature as a function of the charge density displays characteristic resonances ( and hence amplification of the critical temperature itself ) when a critical point of the band dispersion is crossed by the chemical potential .",
