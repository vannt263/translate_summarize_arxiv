    "power - law distributions have attracted particular attention for their mathematical properties and appearances in a wide variety of scientific contexts , from physical and biological sciences to social and man - made phenomena .    differently from those normally distributed , empirical quantities distributed according to a power - law do not cluster around an average value , and thus we can not characterize a power - law distribution through its mean and standard deviation .",
    "however , the fact that some scientific observations can not be characterized as simply as other measurements is often a sign of complex underlying processes that deserve further study @xcite .    formally , a discrete or continuous quantity @xmath0 is distributed according to a power - law if its probability distribution is @xmath1    where @xmath2 is called the _ scaling parameter _ of the distribution . however ,",
    "only few empirical phenomena show such a probability distribution for all values of @xmath0",
    ". more often , the power - law applies only for values greater than some minimum value @xmath3 , so that only the tail of a distribution behaves according to a power - law .",
    "a complete introduction to power - law distributions along with a statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power - law behavior in empirical data can be found in @xcite , whereas extensive discussions can be found in @xcite , and references therein .    in this paper , we limit our attention to discrete power - law distributions . in particular",
    ", we focus on the comparison of two samples of discrete data to assess whether they are drawn from the same power - law distribution . for example , we could be interested in assessing whether the number of likes received by posts on facebook and the number of likes received by videos on youtube follow the same power - law distribution , or whether the degrees of the nodes belonging to two separate clusters in a small - world network are distributed according to the same power - law distribution . to answer those questions we can not rely on the kolmogorov - smirov test @xcite .",
    "since such a statistical test is formulated for continuous distributions , its application to discrete distributions will produce approximate p - values due to the presence of ties .    in order to overcome such an issue",
    ", we introduce a statistical hypothesis test based on the log - likelihood ratio to assess whether two samples of discrete data are drawn from the same population . under the null hypothesis , i.e.",
    "the two samples are drawn from the same power - law distribution , the resulting test statistics follows the @xmath4 distribution with @xmath5 degree of freedom .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we provide some basic definitions about discrete power - law distributions . in section 3",
    "we first introduce and discuss the proposed statistical test , and then we conclude with two examples illustrating how the test performs .",
