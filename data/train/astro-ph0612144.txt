    "gravitational waves were theoretically predicted many decades ago by einstein and his theory of general relativity , and their existence has been indirectly confirmed by the pioneering observations of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar @xcite . in the coming years , the physics and astronomy community anticipates the first direct detection of gravitational waves ( gw ) and the birth of a new research field : gw astrophysics , where observations with the first ground - based interferometers ( such as ligo , geo , and virgo ) contribute to the astrophysical understanding of the sources .",
    "double neutron stars ( dns ) and their inspiral due to gw emission represent the primary target source .",
    "this is primarily because they are known to exist in the galaxy , with the hulse - taylor binary and the binary pulsar @xcite being the staples of this class of binary compact objects .",
    "double compact objects with black hole ( bh ) components ( i.e. , bh - ns and bh - bh ) have not yet been discovered in nature , but our current understanding of binary star evolution naturally predicts such bh binaries that would coalesce within a hubble time @xcite .",
    "the sample of known dns in the galaxy has been very well studied and monitored since their discovery and as a result there is a wealth of information about their physical properties .",
    "this observational sample provides us with a unique opportunity to investigate the evolutionary history of these systems and a number of studies have addressed this basic question from different points of view . another way to address",
    "the question of the formation of double compact objects is to develop population synthesis models that follow the evolution of large ensembles of binaries .",
    "such models allow the detailed study of evolutionary channels that lead to double compact object formation and assess their relative efficacy and the main binary evolution phases that affect the final properties of the binaries .",
    "the calculation of inspiral rates for double compact objects and associated event rates for ground - based gw detectors lies at the center of research activity related to gw searches in the last decade .",
    "these calculations were pioneered by @xcite and @xcite . since then , a number of studies have considered this problem and revised these initial results , following the methods introduced in 1991 .",
    "a few years ago @xcite introduced a novel statistical method for the calculation of inspiral rates based on the observed systems ( empirical estimates ) ; this method allowed us for the first time to associate rate estimates with statistical and systematic uncertainties and to place these estimates on the basis of confidence levels .",
    "inspiral rates have also been computed based on population synthesis calculations that explore a limited number of model assumptions . more recently @xcite",
    "have combined the two methods and have used the empirical dns estimates as constraints on model predictions , especially for bh binaries on which we have no direct guidance from observations .    in this paper",
    "we summarize our group s work in this area in the context of double compact object formation , their properties and inspiral rates and in connection to other studies that have appeared in the literature .",
    "according to our current knowledge ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , double neutron stars ( dnss ) form from primordial binaries in which , possibly after some initial mass - transfer phase , both component stars have masses in excess of @xmath0 .",
    "after the primary explodes in a supernova ( sn ) explosion to form the first neutron star ( ns ) , the binary enters a high - mass x - ray binary phase in which the ns accretes matter from the wind of its companion .",
    "the phase ends when the companion star evolves of the main sequence and engulfs the ns in its expanding envelope .",
    "the ns then spirals in towards the core of the companion until enough orbital energy is transferred to the envelope to expel it from the system .",
    "when the envelope is ejected , the binary consists of the ns and the stripped - down helium core of its former giant companion , orbiting each other in a tight orbit .",
    "if the ns is able to accrete during its rapid inspiral , a first `` recycling '' may take place during which it is spun up to millisecond periods .",
    "the helium star then evolves further until it , in turn , explodes and forms a ns .",
    "depending on the mass of the helium star and the size of the orbit at the time of the explosion , the sn may be preceded by a second recycling phase when the helium star fills its roche lobe and transfers mass to the ns @xcite .    in what follows in this section",
    "we use this basic evolutionary framework and the complete , up - to - date set of observational constraints ( at the time of this writing ) on three dns galactic systems to investigate the physical properties of progenitor binaries at the time of the second sn explosion .",
    "we primarily summarize the work presented in @xcite and @xcite with many comparisons to other published studies addressing similar questions .",
    "the recent discovery of the strongly relativistic binary pulsar @xcite which is also the first eclipsing double pulsar system found in our galaxy @xcite has resparked the interest in the evolutionary history and formation of dns systems @xcite .",
    "shortly after the discovery of psrj0737 - 3039 , @xcite and @xcite independently derived that , right before the second sn explosion , the binary was so tight that the helium star must have been overflowing its critical roche lobe .",
    "this conclusion , for the first time , strongly confirmed the above formation channel for dns binaries .",
    "the observed 22.7ms pulsar ( hereafter psrj0737 - 3039a or pulsar  a ) then corresponds to the first - born ns , and its 2.8s pulsar companion ( hereafter psrj0737 - 3039b or pulsar  b ) to the second - born ns .",
    "the main properties of the double pulsar system and its component stars relevant to this investigation are summarized in table  1 of @xcite .",
    "the kinematic properties of psrj0737 - 3039 have undergone significant revision since @xcite used interstellar scintillation measurements and inferred a velocity component perpendicular to the line - of - sight of @xmath1 . @xcite",
    "derived a reduced velocity of @xmath2 by incorporating anisotropies of the interstellar medium in the interstellar scintillation model .",
    "this reduced velocity , however , strongly depends on the adopted anisotropy model .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , used pulsar timing measurements to derive a firm model - independent upper limit of @xmath3 on the transverse velocity .",
    "the kick imparted to pulsar  b at birth is expected to tilt the orbital plane and misalign pulsar  a s spin axis with respect to the post - sn orbital angular momentum axis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the degree of misalignment depends on both the magnitude and the direction of the kick , and therefore yields a valuable piece of information on pulsar  b s natal kick velocity . in @xcite",
    "we showed that for the pre- and post - sn orbital parameters compatible with all available observational constraints , misalignment angles between approximately @xmath4 and @xmath5 are highly unlikely .",
    "@xcite derived observational constraints on the spin - orbit misalignment based on the stability of pulsar  a s mean pulse profile over a time span of 3 years .",
    "the authors concluded the angle to be smaller than @xmath6 or larger than @xmath7 , in agreement with the theoretical predictions of @xcite .",
    "these misalignment limits inferred by @xcite are incorporated in the list of available observational constraints .    among the constraints inferred from observations ,",
    "the most uncertain parameter affecting the reconstruction of the system s formation and evolutionary history is its age .",
    "characteristic ages , defined as half the ratio of the spin period to the spin - down rate , are the most commonly adopted age estimators , but are known to be quite unreliable ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of psrj0737 - 3039 , the spin evolution of pulsar  b is furthermore very likely affected by torques exerted by pulsar  a on pulsar  b @xcite , adding to the uncertainties of its age .",
    "@xcite therefore derived an alternative age estimate by noting that , according to the standard dns formation channel , the time expired since the end of pulsar  a s spin - up phase should be equal to the time expired since the birth of pulsar  b. by combining this property with a selection of different spin - down models , the authors derived a _ most likely _ age of 30 - 70myr , but were unable to firmly exclude younger and older ages .",
    "a third age estimate can be obtained by assuming that pulsar  a was recycled to the maximum spin rate and calculating the time required for it to spin down to the currently observed value .",
    "this so - called spin - down age provides an upper limit to the age of the system of 100myr @xcite . in view of these uncertainties , we derive constraints on the formation and evolution of psrj0737 - 3039 for three different sets of age assumptions : ( i ) @xmath8myr , ( ii ) @xmath9myr ( the most likely age range derived by @xcite ) , and ( iii ) @xmath10myr ( the characteristic age of pulsar  b ) .      in the following subsections we use the presently known observational constraints to reconstruct the evolutionary history of psrj0737 - 3039 and constrain its properties at the formation time of pulsar  b. more specifically , our aim is to derive a probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the magnitude and direction of the kick velocity imparted to pulsar  b at birth , the mass of pulsar  b s progenitor immediately before it explodes in a sn explosion , and the orbital separation of the component stars right before the sn explosion .",
    "other recent studies with similar goals include @xcite and @xcite . adopting the standard dns formation channel , the progenitor of the double pulsar right before the formation of pulsar  b , consists of the first - born ns , pulsar  a , and the helium star progenitor of the second - born ns . since the formation of the second ns is preceded by one or more mass - transfer phases , tidal forces",
    "can safely be assumed to circularize the orbit prior to the formation of pulsar  b. in what follows , we refer to the times right before and right after the formation of pulsar  b by pre - sn and post - sn , respectively .",
    "the analysis presented consists of four major parts .",
    "firstly , the motion of the system in the galaxy is traced back in time up to a maximum age of @xmath11myr .",
    "the goal of this calculation is to derive the position and center - of - mass velocity of the binary right after the formation of pulsar  b , and use this information to constrain the kick imparted to it at birth . in order to determine possible birth sites ,",
    "our analysis is supplemented with the assumptions that the primordial dns progenitor was born close to the galactic plane , and that the first sn explosion did not kick the binary too far out of it .",
    "the first assumption is conform with our current knowledge that massive stars form and live close to the galactic plane ( their typical scale height is @xmath1270pc ) .",
    "the second assumption on the other hand neglects a small fraction of systems formed with high space velocities @xcite . under these assumptions ,",
    "the binary is still close to the galactic plane at the formation time of pulsar  b. possible birth sites can thus be obtained by calculating the motion in the galaxy backwards in time and looking for crossings of the orbit with the galactic mid - plane . the times in the past at which the plane crossings occur yield kinematic estimates for the age of the dns , while comparison of the system s total center - of - mass velocity with the local galactic rotational velocity at the birth sites yields the system s post - sn _ peculiar _ velocity .",
    "secondly , the orbital semi - major axis and eccentricity right after the sn explosion forming pulsar  b are determined by integrating the equations governing the evolution of the orbit due to gravitational wave emission backwards in time .",
    "the integration is performed for each galactic plane crossing found from the galactic motion calculations . since each crossing yields a different kinematic age , and thus a different endpoint of the reverse orbital evolution calculation ,",
    "the post - sn parameters are a function of the considered galactic plane crossing .",
    "thirdly , the conservation laws of orbital energy and angular momentum are used to map the post - sn binary parameters to the pre - sn ones .",
    "the mapping depends on the kick velocity imparted to pulsar  b at birth and results in constraints on the magnitude and direction of the kick velocity , the mass of pulsar  b s pre - sn helium star progenitor , and the pre - sn orbital separation .",
    "the pre - sn orbital eccentricity is assumed to be zero , as expected from strong tidal forces operating on the binary during the mass - transfer phase(s ) responsible for spinning up pulsar  a. the kick and pre- and post - sn binary parameters are then furthermore subjected to the requirements that they be consistent with the post - sn peculiar velocity obtained from the galactic motion calculations and with the observationally inferred spin - orbit misalignment angle of pulsar  a. the latter constraint requires the additional assumption that tidal forces align the pre - sn rotational angular momentum vector of pulsar  a with the pre - sn orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "fourthly , the solutions of the conservation laws of orbital energy and angular momentum are weighted according to the likelihood that they lead to the system s currently observed position and velocity in the galaxy .",
    "a pdf of the admissible kick velocity and progenitor parameters is then constructed by binning the solutions in a multi - dimensional `` rectangular '' grid . the maximum of the resulting pdf yields the most likely magnitude and direction of the kick velocity imparted to pulsar  b at birth , mass of pulsar  b s pre - sn helium star progenitor , and pre - sn orbital separation .",
    "we also investigate the sensitivity of the pdf to the adopted assumptions by systematically varying the underlying assumptions , such as , e.g. , the age and the magnitude of the transverse systemic velocity component .",
    "tracing the motion of psrj0737 - 3039 back in time requires the knowledge of both its present - day position and 3-dimensional space velocity .",
    "unfortunately , no method is presently available to measure radial velocities of dnss , so that the knowledge of their space velocity is limited to the component perpendicular to the line - of - sight ( transverse velocity ) . at the time of this analysis ,",
    "only an upper limit was available for the double pulsar has been reported by @xcite . ] .",
    "the direction of the motion in the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight is still unknown .",
    "therefore we explore the system s kinematic history in terms of two unknown parameters : ( i ) the radial component @xmath13 of the present - day systemic velocity , and ( ii ) the orientation @xmath14 of the transverse velocity in the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "since the results presented in this paper do not depend on the exact definition of @xmath14 , we refer the reader to @xcite for a more detailed discussion and definition .",
    "we calculate the motion of the system in the galaxy backwards in time using the galactic potential of @xcite with updated model parameters derived by @xcite .",
    "since at the time of the analysis kinematical constraints provided only an upper limit of 30km@xmath15 on the transverse systemic velocity , and the calculation of the past orbit requires precise starting values for both the present - day position and the present - day velocity , we calculate the motion backwards in time for two specific velocities : @xmath16kms@xmath17 and @xmath18kms@xmath17 in what follows .",
    "the number of galactic plane crossings associated with each @xmath13 and @xmath14 , within the adopted age limit of 100myr , can be anywhere between 1 and 5 .",
    "the times in the past at which the system crosses the galactic plane furthermore yield kinematic estimates for the age of the dns , while subtraction of the galactic rotational velocity from the total systemic velocity at the birth sites yields the peculiar velocity right after the formation of pulsar  b.    since there are no a priori constraints on the magnitude of the radial velocity , we examine the effect of incorporating large radial velocities in the analysis by weighting each considered radial velocity according to a pre - determined radial velocity distribution . for this purpose , we performed a population synthesis study of galactic dnss , including their kinematic evolution in the potential of @xcite .",
    "theoretical radial velocity distributions are then obtained by taking a snapshot of the population at the current epoch and determining the radial velocity for each dns in the sample .",
    "the resulting pdfs are found to be represented well by gaussian distributions with means of 0kms@xmath17 and velocity dispersions of 60200kms@xmath17 , depending on the adopted population synthesis assumptions . for comparison , we also consider a uniform radial velocity distribution in which all radial velocities between -1500kms@xmath17 and 1500kms@xmath17 are equally probable . for the other unknown parameter",
    ", the orientation angle @xmath14 of the transverse velocity component in the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight , we assume a uniform distribution between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in fig .",
    "[ vcm ] , the distribution of post - sn peculiar velocities obtained by tracing the motion of psrj0737 - 3039 in the galaxy back in time is shown for a present - day transverse velocity component of 30kms@xmath17 , and kinematic age ranges of 0 - 100myr and 49 - 51myr .",
    "these probability distributions are calculated considering weights according to ( i ) the probability that the system has a present - day radial velocity @xmath13 ( assumed to be distributed according to a uniform or a gaussian distribution ) , ( ii ) the transverse velocity has a direction angle @xmath14 ( assumed to be uniformly distributed ) , and ( iii ) the system is found at its current position in the galaxy ( determined by the time the system spends near its current position divided by its kinematic age ) .    here , we determine the probability of finding the system at its current position in the galaxy in three dimensions ( i.e. , besides the vertical distance to the galactic plane , we also consider the radial and azimuthal position in the plane ) .",
    "for this purpose , we determine the time the system spends in a sphere with radius @xmath21 centered on its current location for all @xmath13- and @xmath14-values considered for the derivation of the possible birth sites .",
    "the probability to find the system near its current position is then determined as the time it spends in this sphere divided by its age . for the latter ,",
    "we adopt the kinematic ages obtained by tracing the motion of the system backwards in time , so that the probability of finding the system near its current position depends on the radial velocity @xmath13 , the proper motion direction @xmath14 , and the galactic plane crossing considered along the orbit associated with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we performed some test calculations to successfully verify that the results based on the thus determined probabilities are insensitive to the adopted value of @xmath21 , as long as it is sufficiently small for the sphere to represent a local neighborhood near the system s current position .",
    "for the results presented in this paper we , somewhat arbitrarily , choose @xmath22pc .    ultimately , the probability that , for a given pair of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the post - sn peculiar velocity of the binary is equal to @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of galactic plane crossings associated with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath26 is the time the system spends near its current position for the orbit associated with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and @xmath27 is the kinematic age corresponding to the @xmath28-th plane crossing associated with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the factor @xmath29 is equal to 1 when the @xmath28-th plane crossing along the orbit associated with @xmath13 and @xmath14 yields a post - sn peculiar velocity equal to @xmath23 , and equal to 0 otherwise .",

    "up to 100kms@xmath17 are likely for all four radial velocity distributions .",
    "the highest post - sn peculiar velocities are found for the gaussian radial velocity distributions with velocity dispersions of 130kms@xmath17 and 200kms@xmath17 ( @xmath23 values remain likely up to 200300kms@xmath17 ) and the uniform radial velocity distribution ( @xmath23 values follow an almost flat distribution from 300kms@xmath17 to 1500kms@xmath17 ) . for ages of 49 - 51myr ,",
    "the post - sn peculiar velocity distributions all have a peak at 50kms@xmath17 . in the case of the uniform radial velocity distribution and the gaussian distributions with velocity dispersions of 130kms@xmath17 or 200kms@xmath17 , additional peaks of almost equal height occur at even higher post - sn peculiar velocities .",
    "similar conclusions apply to the post - sn peculiar velocity distributions obtained for a present - day transverse velocity component of 10kms@xmath17 . despite the small lower limit on the present - day _ transverse _ systemic velocity ,",
    "a wide range of non - negligible post - sn peculiar velocities is thus possible .",
    "we note however that the distributions shown here incorporate all possible post - sn peculiar velocities obtained from tracing the motion of the system backwards in time and that some of these may require sn kicks and mass loss that are incompatible with the observational constraints on the orbital elements and component masses of the double pulsar .",
    "after the formation of pulsar  b , the evolution of the system is expected to be driven exclusively by the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "we use the differential equations derived by @xcite which are valid up to 3.5 post - newtonian order of approximation , and find the resulting post - sn orbital separation @xmath33 to be always between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and the post - sn orbital eccentricity @xmath36 between @xmath37 and @xmath38 . since the kinematic ages are functions of the radial velocity @xmath13 , the proper motion direction @xmath14 , and the galactic plane crossing considered along the past orbit associated with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the particular values of @xmath33 and @xmath36 associated with a given @xmath39 are also functions of these variables .",
    "the pre- and post - sn binary parameters and the kick velocity imparted to pulsar  b at birth are related by the conservation laws of orbital energy and angular momentum . for a circular pre - sn orbit",
    ", the relations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the requirement that these equations permit real solutions for the kick magnitude @xmath40 , the kick orientation angles @xmath41 , @xmath42 , the ns progenitor mass @xmath43 , and the pre - sn orbital semi - major axis @xmath44 , imposes constraints on all of these parameters . for a mathematical formulation of these constraints ,",

    ", the sn explosion also imparts a kick velocity to the binary s center of mass and tilts the post - sn orbital plane with respect to the pre - sn one . the center - of - mass velocity and tilt angle add additional constraints on the solutions of the conservation laws of orbital energy and angular momentum .",
    "the constraints on the progenitor of psrj0737 - 3039 resulting from the dynamics of asymmetric sn explosions arise solely from tracing the evolution of the current system properties backwards in time .",
    "the pre - sn orbital separations and pulsar  b progenitor masses found this way are , however , not necessarily accessible through the currently known dns formation channels .",
    "further constraints on the progenitor of pulsar  b can therefore be obtained from stellar and binary evolution calculations .",
    "firstly , a lower limit on the mass of pulsar  b s pre - sn progenitor is given by the requirement that the star must be massive enough to evolve into a ns rather than a white dwarf . according to our current understanding of helium star evolution ,",
    "the minimum helium star mass required for ns formation is 2.12.8@xmath45 .",
    "the actual helium star minimum mass is , however , still considerably uncertain due to the poorly understood evolution of massive stars and possible interactions with close binary companions .",
    "we impose a lower limit of @xmath46 on the mass of pulsar  b s pre - sn helium star progenitor .",
    "however , in the light of recent suggestions that the progenitor of pulsar  b may have been significantly less massive than the conventional lower limit of @xmath46 , we also explore the possibility of progenitor masses as low as pulsar b s present - day mass of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "unless our current understanding of helium star evolution is seriously flawed , this scenario implies that the progenitor of pulsar  b must have lost a significant amount of mass ( at least @xmath48 ) after it had already established a sufficiently massive core to guarantee the occurrence of a future sn explosion .",
    "we note that this possibility is included in the binary population synthesis calculations used to derive the adopted theoretical dns radial - velocity distributions .    secondly in @xcite , we showed that the pre - sn binary was so tight ( @xmath49 ) that the helium star progenitor of pulsar  b must have been overflowing its roche lobe at the time of its sn explosion ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "an upper limit on the progenitor mass is therefore given by the requirement that this mass - transfer phase be dynamically stable ( otherwise the components would have merged and no dns would have formed ) .",

    "this is in contrast to the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite who emphasize that the proximity of the double pulsar to the galactic plane implies that pulsar  b most likely received only a small kick at birth and that its progenitor most likely had mass of @xmath57 .",
    "hence , based on the currently available observational constraints , a wide range of progenitor and kick velocity properties are favored for psrj0737 - 3039b . in particular , the constraints are compatible with a conventional hydrodynamical or neutrino - driven sn explosion from a helium star more massive than @xmath46 , as well as an electron - capture sn from a helium star less massive than @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have speculated that the electron - capture sn mechanism may be typical for close binaries and that it may be accompanied by much smaller kicks than hydrodynamical or neutrino - driven sn explosions .",

    "this implies that the current estimated dns merger rate including j0737@xmath1513039 can still be doubled !",

    "lacking a sample of dcos containing a black hole , the only route to bh - bh merger rates is via population synthesis models .",
    "these involve a monte carlo exploration of the likely life histories of binary stars , given statistics governing the initial conditions for binaries and a method for following the behavior of single and binary stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "unfortunately , our understanding of the evolution of single and binary stars is incomplete , and we parameterize the associated uncertainties with a great many parameters ( @xmath226 ) , many of which can cause the predicted dco merger rates to vary by more than one or two orders of magnitude when varied independently through their plausible range . to arrive at more definitive answers for dco merger rates , we must substantially reduce our uncertainty in the parameters that enter into population synthesis calculations through comparison with observations when possible .",
    "the simplest and most direct way to constrain the parameters of a given population synthesis code is to compare several of its many predictions against observations .",
    "for example , @xcite required their population synthesis models be consistent with the empirically estimated formation rates derived from the four known galactic ns@xmath151ns  binaries which are tight enough to merge through the emission of gravitational waves within @xmath227gyr . here , we require our population synthesis models to be consistent ( modulo experimental error ) with six observationally determined rates : ( i ) the formation rate implied by the known galactic merging ns@xmath151ns  binaries , mentioned above ; ( ii ) the formation rate implied by the known galactic ns@xmath151ns  binaries which do _ not _ merge within @xmath227 gyr ( henceforth denoted `` wide '' ns@xmath151ns  binaries ) ; ( iii , iv ) the formation rate implied by the sample of merging and eccentric wd - ns binaries ; and finally ( v , vi ) the type ii and type ib / c sne rates .",
    "further , we use the set of models consistent with these constraints to revise our population - synthesis - based expectations for various dco merger rates , assuming no prior information , so all population synthesis model parameters consistent with our constraints are treated equally .",

    "the infrastructure needed to incorporate uncertainties in the pulsar luminosity function has been presented in  4.2 . however , out - of - date constraints on the pulsar luminosity function allow implausibly high minimum pulsar luminosities @xmath231 .",
    "a high minimum pulsar luminosity implies fewer merging pulsars have been missed by surveys .",

    "supernovae rates , being ill - determined due to the large observational systematic errors mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : data : other ] , are easily reproduced by almost all models at the @xmath244 level ; see fig .",

    "[ fig : constraintsversusdistribs : wdns ] and [ fig : constraintsversusdistribs : nsns ] .",
    "these four 95% confidence intervals implicitly define a @xmath254 confidence interval in the seven - dimensional space , consisting of @xmath255 of the original parameter volume when systematic errors in our fitting procedure are included . in other words , we are quite confident ( @xmath256 chance ) that the physically - appropriate parameters entering into _ startrack _ can be confined within a small seven - dimensional volume , in principle significantly reducing our model uncertainty .    in figure  [",
    "fig : params ] we show one - dimensional projections onto each coordinate axis of the constraint - satisfying volume  in other words , the distribution of values each _ individual _ population synthesis parameter can take .",

    "as seen in the top panel of this figure , the conditional distribution of supernovae kicks bears a surprising resemblance to the observed pulsar kick distribution ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the population synthesis mass transfer parameter @xmath253 is also well - constrained , with a strong maximum near @xmath265 , implying that mass - loss fractions of about 90% or higher are favored in non - conservative , but stable , mass transfer episodes .",
    "also , common envelope efficiencies @xmath266 of about 0.2 - 0.5 appear to be favored by the constraints .",

    "additionally , a smoothed curve shows the results modulated by the effect of systematic error .",
    "these results should be contrasted with the distinctly different post - constraint results shown in @xcite ( cf .",
    "their figure 5 and c7 ) .",
    "notably , even though _ two fewer _ constraints were imposed , they find a significantly smaller ( @xmath278 versus @xmath255 ) constraint - satisfying volume .",
    "in large part , these differences can be ascribed to including systematic errors : in @xcite , preliminary data for the sparse and poor - quality nsns(vw ) sample was fit and applied without any account for fit - induced errors",
    ". however , our calculation also differs at several fundamental levels from the original approach : ( i ) the space of models studied is larger , covering more area in @xmath279 ( see , e.g .",
    "* ) ; ( ii ) the observed sample of merging ns - ns binaries is compared with the _ total _ merging ns - ns formation rate predicted from population synthesis , rather than with subset of merging ns - ns which undergo mass transfer ; and critically ( iii ) the constraints are more numerous .    finally , in figure [",
    "fig : results : ligo1 ] we estimate the range of initial and advanced ligo detection rates implied by these constrained results .",
    "this estimate combines our constrained population synthesis results ; our estimates for systematic fitting error ; the approximate ligo range as a function of chirp mass @xmath280 : @xmath281 where @xmath282 , @xmath283 for initial and advanced ligo , respectively ; estimates for the average volume detected for a given species , as represented by @xmath284 for bh - bh , bh - ns , and ns - ns , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and a homogeneous , euclidean universe populated with milky way - equivalent galaxies with density @xmath277 , each forming stars at rate @xmath285 .",
    "updated rates that address a number of these simplifications will be examined in two forthcoming papers , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a proof - of - concept calculation to compare population synthesis simulations with observations , interpret the resulting constrained volume , and apply the constraint - satisfying parameters to revise a priori predictions of astrophysically critical rate results . here",
    "we demonstrate that even when systematic model fitting errors are aggressively overcompensated for , observational constraints still provide information about population synthesis parameters .",
    "these results include both surprisingly good agreement with pulsar kick distributions and strong constraints on at least one parameter involved in binary evolution .",
    "since in almost all cases our systematic errors appear much smaller than those from observations , we are confident that now _ observational",
    "_ limitations , rather than computational ones , primarily limit our ability to constrain population synthesis results . in particular , we expect stringent tests of population synthesis models are possible , beginning by imposing more observational constraints than varied model parameters ( seven in our case ) .",
    "our approach also strongly suggests that population synthesis estimates for dco merger rates vary in a very complex manner , as indicated by the large @xmath286 produced by even the best low - order polynomial fits to often often very high - quality data ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we strongly suspect that a more physically motivated class of basis functions could achieve a much better fit ; we intend to explore this possibility , along with the reliability of purely nonparametric fits , in a future study .",
    "our analysis remains predicated upon a correct identification of all parameters and input physics critical for the formation of double compact objects .",
    "admittedly , our understanding of binary evolution continues to evolve ; however multiple population studies from different groups over the years lead to very similar conclusions about the basic input physics that primarily affects the formation rates of double compact objects  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use a relatively new version of the _ startrack _ code that is described in great detail in @xcite . a forthcoming paper ( belczynski , kalogera , & bulik , in preparation ) will discuss how these updates affect the evolutionary history and formation rates in significantly greater detail .",
    "our analysis also remains predicated upon a correct and complete interpretation of the observational sample and associated systematic and model uncertainties . in some respects ,",
    "however , our models for observations and their biases may be incomplete or not representative .",
    "we effectively assume pulsar recycling is required to detect binary pulsars in our implicit hypothesis that only one pulsar in ns - ns systems , the one observed , was ever likely to have been detected . and finally we use a canonical value for pulsar beaming correction factor @xmath253 for several systems with known spins but unknown beaming geometry .",
    "( we hope to address these questions in a forthcoming paper . )",
    "last , our analysis of dco merger rates remains predicated on the assumption that the milky way formed stars at a relatively uniform rate for the last @xmath227  gyr .",
    "however , as will be demonstrated at greater length in two forthcoming papers @xcite , if the star formation rate increased significantly when the milky way was young , then since most binaries would then form early in the lifetime of the milky way , the young - galaxy contribution could conceivably overwhelm the present - day contribution .",
    "in other words , the present - day milky way merger rate for bh - bh binaries , for example , could be completely determined by the star formation rate nearly @xmath227  gyr ago .    and to be comprehensive regarding the factors neglected here , our population synthesis parameter study has not varied over _ all _ plausible models .",
    "we have neither considered purely polar supernova kicks ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) nor changed the maximum ns mass from @xmath287 nor even allowed for a heterogeneous birth population of single stars and binaries ( a binary fraction of 100% is assumed in all models ) .",
    "and of course we continue to use a single fixed star formation rate for the milky way , rather than treat it as an independent uncertain but constrained parameter .",
    "however , all these limitations can be remedied by closer study .",
    "thus , we expect that either ( i ) all dco merger rates will become determined to within @xmath288 or better ( based on the comparative accuracy to which we know ns - ns merger rates ) , or ( ii ) experimental data will conflict with the prevailing notion of binary population synthesis , revealing flaws and limitations in classical parametric models for binary stellar evolution .",
    "it has now been more than 30 years since the discovery of the first binary pulsar that happened to also be the first binary with two neutron stars .",
    "this discovery has essentially led to the development of a whole sub - field in compact object astrophysics and progress in this area has also greatly contributed to the progress in the development of gravitational - wave observatories over these years .    as we anticipate the direct detection of gravitational waves from binary inspirals and the possible , associated discovery of black hole binaries , we also take advantage of pulsar timing observations to the fullest and continually try to improve our understanding of the origin of tight double compact objects .",
    "it is clear that a lot of progress has been particularly made in the last few years with the discovery of the highly relativistic , first double pulsar and additional double neutron stars , and the tremendous progress in proper motion and pulse profile evolution measurements .",
    "more interestingly , our standard way of thinking about double compact object formation is called to question with a number of intriguing suggestions and counter - suggestions put forward : do neutron stars form through two different physical mechanisms depending on the mass of their immediate progenitor at the time of core collapse @xcite do some or the majority of neutron stars receive minimal supernova kicks with magnitudes significantly smaller than 50kms@xmath17 @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "some of the older questions still persist : what is the basic physical mechanism for core collapse that also drives supernovae ? do most black holes form through fallback onto proto - neutron - stars and supernovae or through direct collapse ? what is the mass function of black holes and how does it depend on metallicity ?",
    "why are neutron star masses so close to one another in double neutron stars ? what really determines the birth spins and spin evolution of neutron stars and black holes ?",
    "starting with the very basic question of the core collapse physical mechanism hans bethe was intrigued by many of these questions and naturally his interest evolved towards binary compact objects , their evolutionary history , and their potential as gravitational wave sources .",
    "given the progress we have experienced since the discovery of the first dns binary , it is reasonable to expect that with the combination of developments in pulsar searches and observations , of the rise of gravitational - wave detections and astrophysics , and of the progress in theoretical physical understanding and computational astrophysics we will be able to answer some of the basic remaining questions raised by the existence of binary compact objects in nature .",
