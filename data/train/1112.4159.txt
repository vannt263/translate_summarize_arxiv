    "parametric resonance @xcite is one of the most fundamental and frequently applied non - linear phenomena . if a non - linear oscillator with the resonant frequency @xmath1 is a.c .",
    "driven at frequency @xmath2 , a coherent resonant response at frequency @xmath3 emerges provided the driving amplitude exceeds an instability threshold set by the non - linear parameters of the oscillator . while the coherent response is absent below the threshold , the parametric resonance is manifested there by enhanced fluctuations with frequencies close to @xmath3 . in the quantum realm ( @xmath4 with @xmath5 the temperature )",
    ", these fluctuations can be regarded as an emission of radiation .",
    "an elementary radiation event is an emission of a pair of photons of the frequency @xmath6 caused by absorption of a single photon of the frequency @xmath7 . in quantum optics ,",
    "the corresponding phenomenon is called down - conversion@xcite since a single photon is converted into two .",
    "the down - conversion is a base of optical quantum - information applications@xcite .",
    "the phenomenon has been employed to produce squeezed states of light@xcite and pairs of quantum - entangled photons@xcite .",
    "it seems natural to assume that the statistics of the radiation is that of uncorrelated elementary events , each event being the emission of a correlated / entangled pair . in most optical experiments ,",
    "this assumption is correct and practical .",
    "however , it relies on the fact that only a minor fraction of emitted pairs is actually detected .",
    "detected events are separated by large time intervals and thus do not show any correlation .",
    "recently , a set of pioneering experiments @xcite has advanced quantum non - linear optics into the microwave frequency range .",
    "thereby , atoms are replaced by superconducting qubits made using josephson junctions , and the radiation is confined to transmission lines and electrical oscillators .",
    "the latter represents a large technical advantage in comparison with an optical experiment due to the fact the radiation is not lost and concentrated .",
    "this enhances the non - linearities of the system .",
    "very recently , accurate measurements of the radiation emitted by a dc voltage - biased josephson junction embedded in a microwave resonator have been reported .",
    "@xcite the josephson generation frequency @xmath8 can be tuned to double the resonant frequency , fulfilling the conditions of parametric resonance .",
    "importantly , up to @xmath9 of the emitted radiation can be detected and the fluctuations of the detector signal can be quantified as well.@xcite this motivated us to study the statistics of the radiation in this setup .",
    "the full photon counting statistics of the degenerate optical parametric oscillator has been addressed in @xcite for a specific case when the driving frequency is precisely @xmath10 . since the observation of non - poissonian features of these statistics requires collection efficiency not achievable in optical setups ,",
    "this work has not attracted the attention it deserves .",
    "let us note that the measurements of statistics do not require the detector to be an actual counter giving the output signal in terms of discrete numbers of counts . a continuous detector output would suffice to quantify cumulants of the radiation intensity fluctuations and thereby characterize the statistics .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the full counting statistics ( fcs ) of radiation below the instability threshold bringing this to the context of josephson circuit . this regime is interesting since despite the fact that the field correlations are entirely gaussian under these conditions , the statistics are highly nontrivial .",
    "we restrict our attention to fcs in the limit of the long measurement times .",
    "we recover the results of @xcite in a different conceptual framework that is directly based on the keldysh - action treatment of dissipative josephson dynamics .",
    "we extend the results to the case of an arbitrary mismatch between driving frequency and @xmath11 .",
    "we provide an interpretation of the statistics . in this interpretation ,",
    "an elementary event is a radiation burst that encompasses correlated emission of @xmath12 pairs , rather than an emission of a single pair .",
    "this is a manifestation of photon bunching .",
    "we outline the similarities with the results @xciteconcerning the bunching in a single - photon regime .",
    "the rate of @xmath12-burst does not diverge upon approaching the threshold . however , larger @xmath12 are favored closer to the threshold .",
    "this results in a divergence of the average radiation intensity and its higher moments .",
    "we support this interpretation by investigating time correlations of the emission events .",
    "further , we quantify the frequency - resolved fluctuations of the radiation .",
