    "it is generally believed that the large - scale structures of the universe , such as those seen in the distribution of galaxies , arose through gravitational instability from primordial seed fluctuations . on scales larger than roughly 8 @xmath12mpc , where @xmath13 is the hubble constant . ] , the dynamics of the universe is dominated by gravitational forces , implying that the matter behaves as if it were purely nonbaryonic and collision - less .",
    "thus , when curvature can be neglected ( for scales below 500@xmath12mpc ) , the evolution of the universe can be described by the vlasov - poisson system of equations , in coordinates comoving with the cosmic expansion . in general ,",
    "nonlinear coupling makes it virtually impossible to solve these equations analytically .",
    "thus , on small scales , where density contrasts are large , @xmath14-body simulations are typically used to obtain numerical solutions . however , on scales larger than about 10@xmath12mpc , the amplitude of the density fluctuations is modest and _ perturbation theory _ ( pt ) can be used to compute statistical properties of the cosmic fields .    here , we focus on the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the local density smoothed with a spherical filter of radius @xmath15 at a time @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the pdf , a simple to measure statistic , has been widely used to characterize the statistical properties of the large scale galaxy distribution ( see , e.g. , alimi , blanchard & schaeffer 1990 ; maurogordato , schaeffer & da costa 1992 ; szapudi , szalay & boschn 1992 ; bouchet et al .",
    "1993 ; gaztaaga 1992 , 1994 ; szapudi , meiksin & nichol 1996 ) .",
    "our aim is to determine whether there is a simple relationship between the pdf obtained for the matter distribution in the nonlinear regime and the one predicted by pt .",
    "the latter should , in principle , be valid only in the weakly nonlinear regime . in our calculations , we assume i ) that the universe is flat with @xmath18 , and ii ) that the initial fluctuations of the density field were gaussian , pressure - less ( i.e. cold ) , and scale - free .    in real galaxy catalogs , the interpretation of the results is complicated by systematic effects , such as the so - called bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution ( e.g. , fry & gaztaaga 1993 , juszkiewicz et al .",
    "1995 ) , redshift distortions in three - dimensional catalogs ( e.g. , matsubara & suto 1994 ; hivon et al .",
    "1995 ) , and effects of projection along the line of sight in two - dimensional catalogs ( e.g. , bernardeau 1995 ) .",
    "in what follows , we focus on the statistical properties of the _ matter _ distribution and thus neglect these effects .",
    "let @xmath19 be the variance of the pdf .",
    "in the weakly nonlinear regime ( @xmath20 ) the scale - free nature of the initial conditions implies @xmath21 in general , the pdf of the local density can be characterized by the behavior of its cumulants ( the connected part of the moments ) , @xmath22 ( see e.g. bernardeau 1994a , hereafter b94 for a more precise definition ) . note that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the density contrast @xmath25 .",
    "when the variance is small , the dominant contribution to all the cumulants can be calculated analytically from pt for a top - hat smoothing window ( b94 ) .",
    "the result is that the quantities @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 are all _ finite constants _ in the limit of small variance as a function of only the variance .",
    "this would not be possible for scale dependent initial conditions such as cold dark matter ( cdm ) . ] .",
    "the next - to - leading order term is expected to be proportional to @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 comparisons with numerical simulations have shown that the pt predictions are accurate as long as @xmath30 ( juszkiewicz et al .",

    "what follows , we use these definitions as fitting functions of the @xmath26 ratios , leaving @xmath6 as a free parameter .",
    "one can then invert the above equations to deduce , for each @xmath36 , the value of @xmath6 which yields the measured value , @xmath37 , of the parameters @xmath26 .",
    "we use this approach to define functions @xmath38 , ( @xmath39 ) , by @xmath40\\equiv s_q^{\\rm meas}(\\sigma).\\ ] ] of course , as discussed above , the measured @xmath41 s are expected to have identical values in the weakly nonlinear regime ( @xmath42 ) , and be equal to the value of the initial index @xmath6 .    in the nonlinear regime ( @xmath43 ) , however , results from perturbation theory are no longer valid , and we do not expect the functions @xmath41 to take a universal ( constant ) value . actually , there is no _ a priori _ reason why the relation @xmath44 should hold for @xmath45 and @xmath43 , even in the framework of the self - similar / stable clustering hypothesis , where the functions @xmath38 are expected to approach constants in the highly nonlinear regime ( e.g. , davis & peebles 1977 ; peebles 1980 ; balian & schaeffer 1989 , hereafter bs ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use measurements of the pdf by colombi , bouchet & hernquist ( 1996 , hereafter cbh ) in @xmath14-body simulations of flat universes with scale - free initial conditions to show that , within the accuracy of the calculations , all functions @xmath41 superpose to give a unique function @xmath3 @xmath46 the measurement of @xmath26 is difficult when @xmath36 is larger than a few , because of systematic errors due to finite volume effects ( e.g. , colombi , bouchet & schaeffer 1994 , 1995 , hereafter cbsi and cbsii ) .",
    "however , one can check the validity of the property ( [ eq : neff ] ) from the overall _ shape _ of the pdf rather than with its moments .",
    "this would mean that pt can be applied to the nonlinear regime as follows : @xmath47 .",
    "\\label{eq : ept}\\ ] ] we shall refer to this generalization as _ extended perturbation theory _ ( ept ) .",
    "the only quantities that would be needed to compute the pdf , if ept applies , are the functions @xmath48 and the variance itself .",
    "if valid , ept would thus result in tremendous simplification .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the measured quantities @xmath41 , @xmath49 as functions of the variance in our @xmath14-body simulations and show that they indeed define a unique function @xmath48 that can be fitted analytically .",
    "we then compare the pdf predicted by ept to that measured for different values of @xmath5 .",
    "the results allow an extrapolation to non power - law spectra . in section 3",
    "we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the density pdfs in the ept framework which depends only on a few parameters . we relate them to the @xmath3 found .",
    "we conclude in section 4 by summarizing our results and discuss them in light of related works . for completeness ,",
    "in the appendix we summarize the results obtained from pt , the generic properties expected for the density pdf , and the algorithm used to compute it numerically .",
    "the scale - free simulations we analyze are described in detail in cbh .",
    "they were performed with the cosmological tree - code of hernquist , bouchet & suto ( 1991 ) , using @xmath50 particles and periodic boundaries .",
    "we consider four values of the spectral index : @xmath51 , @xmath52 ( two @xmath14-body sets ) , 0 and + 1 .",
    "cbh measured the count probability distribution function ( cpdf ) @xmath53 at various times in these simulations .",
    "the cpdf is just the probability of finding @xmath14 particles in a spherical cell of radius @xmath15 randomly thrown in the data set .",
    "thus , the cpdf differs from the pdf : discreteness effects have to be accounted for to transform the cpdf into the pdf since the latter involves the underlying _ continuous _ density field .",
    "cbh computed the quantities @xmath26 , @xmath49 from the moments of the cpdf , with the proper corrections for discreteness effects .",
    "they studied other contamination effects , such as artificial correlations related to the way initial conditions are generated , short range softening of the forces in the @xmath14-body simulations , and finite volume effects arising from missing waves longer than the box .",
    "in particular , cbh defined a reliable scale range over which finite volume corrections were applied . from these measurements of the functions @xmath54",
    ", we can directly infer @xmath38 for @xmath49 .",
    "this section is organized as follows .",
    "first we study the functions @xmath38 in   2.1 .",
    "we will see that they all superpose to a single function @xmath48 within the measurement errors . in   2.2 , we check whether this result applies to the cpdf itself , and in   2.3 , we present a possible extrapolation to non power - law spectra .      in figure [",
    "fig : figure1 ] , we show the dependence of the deduced @xmath41 on the variance , for each value of @xmath6 .",
    "the various symbols correspond to different values of @xmath36 .",
    "they superpose , which is not surprising in the weakly nonlinear regime since all functions @xmath41 should tend to the same value @xmath6 according to pt ( although not perfectly ; this point is discussed in detail by cbh ) .",
    "more interestingly , the superposition still holds in the nonlinear regime where the vertical spread of the points _ does not increase _",
    "( at least not significantly ) , which corresponds to a very peculiar behavior of the statistics in the nonlinear regime , as discussed in the introduction .    in figure",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] , some analytical fits based on two different approaches are also shown . in each panel ,",

    ", we impose that the index @xmath3 reaches a constant plateau at large @xmath5 , @xmath60 .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 gives the position of the transition between the linear value and the nonlinear value , and @xmath58 defines the width of this transition .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the density field smoothed with top hat windows in @xmath14-body simulations with scale - free initial conditions and linear spectral indices @xmath61 , @xmath52 , 0 and @xmath62 .",
    "we attempted to determine if the following _ extended perturbation theory _",
    "( ept ) applies .",
    "such an ansatz consists of assuming that the pdf is given by @xmath63 , where the function @xmath64 is the prediction of _ perturbation theory _ ( pt , e.g. , b94 ) , which is valid in the weakly nonlinear regime @xmath65 .",
    "the difference with pt is that the _ effective _ spectral index @xmath3 is assumed to be an adjustable parameter of the model and @xmath28 is the _ nonlinear _ variance .",
    "the measurement of low - order moments of the pdf and of the pdf itself in our @xmath14-body experiments shows a remarkable agreement with ept , except for @xmath61 in some regimes .",
    "( this is however a limiting case , subject to many numerical uncertainties , particularly finite volume effects , see e.g. cbh ) .",
    "as can been seen from figure  [ fig : figure1 ] , the effective spectral index , equal of course to @xmath6 in the weakly nonlinear regime , decreases with @xmath5 to approximately reach another plateau at large @xmath5 .",
    "if this second plateau were completely flat , our measurements would agree with the predictions of stable clustering .",
    "this does not appear to be exactly the case , except perhaps for @xmath51 , although the deviation from stable clustering is quite weak .",
    "we do not discuss this problem further here , since it was analyzed extensively in cbh .",
    "the difference between the second and the first plateau increases with @xmath66 . for @xmath67 , we have for example @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath52 and @xmath70 respectively for @xmath61 , @xmath52 , 0 and + 1 .",
    "it is important to notice that the quantity @xmath11 is _ different _ from the logarithmic derivative of @xmath28 with respect to scale , except of course in the weakly nonlinear regime . indeed , as measured in @xmath14-body simulations by efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , cbh , and jain ( 1996 ) , the variance follows quite well the stable clustering predictions in the framework of the self - similar solution ( see , e.g. , davis & peebles 1977 ; peebles 1980 ) , in the regime @xmath71 .",
    "in particular , we get @xmath72 i.e. , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath52 respectively for @xmath61 , @xmath52 , 0 and @xmath62 .",
    "these values are quite different from the @xmath3 we measure .",
    "we have tried to apply ept to a scale dependent power - spectrum , such as cdm .",
    "the results given in figure  [ fig : figure4 ] are encouraging .",
    "however , further investigations are needed to address the case of non power - law spectra in greater detail .",
    "szapudi , meiksin & nichol ( 1996 ) have recently measured the functions @xmath41 in the edinburgh / durham southern galaxy catalogue ( edsgc ) . in this angular survey ,",
    "the functions @xmath41 superpose well , given the uncertainties in the measurements , although there is a systematic increase in the scatter of values of @xmath41 on small scales .",
    "szapudi et al .",
    "find , as we do , that the function @xmath3 exhibits two plateaus , one on small scales where @xmath76 and another on large scales where @xmath77 , in good qualitative agreement with the results of our analysis and with what would be expected in a cdm - like universe .",
    "of course , such a comparison is limited by the fact that there are non trivial projection effects of the galaxy distribution along the line of sight in angular surveys .",
    "moreover , one has to keep in mind that light does not necessarily trace mass .",
    "if ept is indeed valid , a knowledge of the variance @xmath5 and of the spectral index @xmath3 is sufficient to compute the pdf .",
    "we have provided analytical fits to the function @xmath48 . the nonlinear variance @xmath28 can itself be calculated with other nonlinear ansatz , such as the fitting formula found by hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) ( improved later by peacock & dodds 1994 ; jain , mo & white 1995 ; baugh & gaztaaga 1996 ) , provided one generalizes it to the smoothed density field .",
    "our analysis has been done for flat universes with density parameter @xmath78 .",
    "pt predictions for the ratios @xmath26 are expected to be only weakly dependent on the value of @xmath79 or on the cosmological constant @xmath80 ( e.g. , martel & freudling 1991 , bouchet 1992 , 1995 , bernardeau 1992 , 1994b , hivon 1995 ) .",
    "but this does not really guaranty the existence of a universal function @xmath81 in the case @xmath82 and/or @xmath83 .",
    "more investigations have to be undertaken in this regime .    of course , it also remains to explain why the hierarchy of cumulants of the pdf looks similar in the weakly nonlinear and the highly nonlinear regimes .",
    "one way to address this question would be to study the transition between the two regimes , by computing higher order corrections in equation ( [ eq : sqpt ] ) ( e.g. , scoccimarro & frieman 1996 ; scoccimarro 1996 ) .",
    "alternatively , as in the early attempts of fry ( 1984 ) and hamilton ( 1988 ) , one could study the bbgky equations ( see , e.g. , peebles 1980 ) to try to find clues for the determination of the @xmath26 parameters in the highly nonlinear regime .",

    "<S> perturbation theory makes it possible to calculate the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the large scale density field in the small variance limit , @xmath0 . for top hat smoothing and scale - free gaussian initial fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> the result depends only on the linear variance , @xmath1 , and its logarithmic derivative with respect to the filtering scale @xmath2 ( bernardeau 1994a ) .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the pdf and its low - order moments in scale - free simulations evolved well into the nonlinear regime and compare the results with the above predictions , assuming that the spectral index and the variance are _ adjustable _ parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the true , nonlinear variance . with these additional degrees of freedom , results from perturbation </S>",
    "<S> theory provide a good fit of the pdfs , even in the highly nonlinear regime . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath3 is of course equal to @xmath6 when @xmath0 , and it decreases with increasing @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a nearly flat plateau is reached when @xmath7 . in this regime , the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath6 increases when @xmath6 decreases . for initial power - spectra with @xmath8 , we find @xmath9 when @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that @xmath11 is _ different _ from the logarithmic derivative of the nonlinear variance with respect to the filtering scale . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , it is not straightforward to determine the nonlinearly evolved pdf from arbitrary ( scale - dependent ) initial conditions , such as cold dark matter , although we propose a simple method that makes this feasible .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , estimates of the variance ( using , for example , the prescription proposed by hamilton et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1991 ) and of @xmath3 as functions of scale for a given power spectrum makes it possible to calculate the local density pdf at any time from the initial conditions .    # </S>",
