    "the southern sky below a declination of @xmath2 is still not well explored in the radio band compared to the northern sky and many of the intrinsically most powerful radio sources might not have ever been imaged in detail at radio wavelengths .",
    "suspecting this to be the case , we began to search for evidence of the most powerful southern hemisphere radio sources from archival spectral information .",
    "two sources stood out : pks 0743@xmath367 ( reported in @xcite ) ; and pks 1018@xmath342 .    in this letter , we present the first deep radio observations of pks 1018@xmath342 , a quasar at @xmath4 @xcite with a 5 ghz flux density over 1.2 jy @xcite .",
    "the steep radio spectrum of pks 1018@xmath342 over a frequency range of 80 mhz @xcite to 31.4 ghz @xcite suggests that the source is dominated by optically thin radio lobe emission rather than doppler - boosted core emission . due to its southerly declination ,",
    "there are no previously published deep radio maps of this extremely powerful object , however @xcite obtained vla observations giving an indication of some source structure , but were not sufficient to reveal the detailed source morphology .",
    "basic structural information from the vla observations was limited only to the 20 cm waveband .",
    "we have used australia telescope compact array ( atca ) observations to separate the core and lobe emission between 2.5 and 8.6 ghz , in order to caclulate the time - averaged kinetic luminosity of the jets , @xmath5 , making pks 1018@xmath342 one of the most kinetically dominated quasars known .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath6=70 km / s / mpc , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we use the radio spectral index , @xmath9 , as @xmath10 .",
    "the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) was used to obtain observations of pks 1018@xmath342 on december 16 , 2001 , in a series of 20 minute @xmath11cuts@xmath12 over a 12 hour period . for half of the cuts",
    "the atca was configured to observe at frequencies of 1384 and 2496 mhz ( 1.4 and 2.5 ghz ) and at 4800 and 8640 mhz ( 4.8 and 8.6 ghz ) for the other half .",
    "the observations took place while the array was in a 6 km baseline configuration , allowing maximum angular resolution .",
    "at all frequencies the bandwidth was 128 mhz in each of two crossed linear polarisations .",
    "standard data reduction and imaging techniques were used to produce images from the data @xcite .",
    "stokes i , q , and u images were produced from the 2.5 , 4.8 , and 8.6 ghz data .",
    "it was found that the 1.4 ghz data proved of insufficient angular resolution to be useful .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting image of pks 1018@xmath342 at 4.8 ghz .",
    "a core is centrally located between two powerful lobes .",
    "estimates of component sizes and positions were made by model - fitting the _ u - v _ data with point sources , circular gaussian , and elliptical gaussian components in the difmap package @xcite and are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we are confident that we have recovered the full flux density of the source at each frequency since at 8.6 ghz , our highest frequency and therefore highest angular resolution , our total measured flux density of 0.63 jy matches the independently determined single dish flux density at this frequency @xcite .",
    "we note that the 8.6 ghz image implies an axial length of 14.9 . in our adopted cosmology",
    ", this corresponds to an axial length of @xmath13 .",

    "we can not separate the core and lobes at 1.4 ghz due to poor angular resolution at this frequency .",
    "however , extrapolating the lobe spectra to 1.4 ghz and subtracting the lobe fluxes at this frequency gives us an estimate of the core flux density of 0.016 jy .",
    "the core spectrum therefore appears to flatten to @xmath21 near 1 ghz .",
    "this being the case , the core appearing to turn over below 1 ghz , the core contribution to the total flux at 151 mhz will be negligible .",
    "extrapolating the lobe flux densities using the 2.5 to 8.6 ghz spectral indices yields flux densities of 16 jy and 45 jy at 408 mhz and 160 mhz , respectively .",

    "thus , the lobe spectrum appears to flatten slightly at frequencies below 1 ghz . using a spectral index derived from the measurements at 408 mhz and 160 mhz , and extrapolating to 151 mhz , yields @xmath22 , which can be used in ( 3.1 ) to give @xmath23 .",

    ", we construct a composite spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a quasar accretion flow @xcite . in order to separate the accretion flow thermal luminosity from ir and optical contamination from the jet , an sed for radio quiet quasars ( normalized to @xmath31 )",

    "in addition to the continuum , the composite spectrum of @xcite indicates that @xmath32 of the total optical / uv quasar luminosity is reprocessed in the broad line region . combining this with the continuum luminosity yields @xmath33 .",

    "the sixth column is the uv spectral index , when it was available . in spite of this search ,",
    "two of the four highest @xmath29 sources in table 3 , 3c 82 and pks 1018@xmath342 had no previously published radio maps and were found by looking for high redshift sources in @xcite with the largest low frequency flux densities and steep spectral indices .",
    "these were the most promising candidates out of the 6225 quasars .",
    "this initiated followup observations reported here and in @xcite .",
    "the two estimates for both 3c 82 ( the highest redshift 3c quasar known ) and 3c 9 ( the highest redshift 3cr quasar ) in the ir and uv are in close agreement , verifying the validity of the composite in table 2 .",
    "both 3c 405 and 3c 190 were added to the list of the five largest @xmath29 sources for comparison purposes .",
    "3c 405 ( cygnus a ) is the best studied example of a very high @xmath16 radio galaxy and the close agreement between the x - ray and ir estimates for 3c 405 are also affirmation of the application of table 2 .",
    "note the difference in the estimates for 3c 190 .",
    "the ir and the continuum uv estimate at @xmath52 disagree tremendously .",
    "this is because 3c 190 is an obscured quasar with a red spectrum , indicated by the steep uv spectral index of 3 .",
    "thus , a third estimate for 3c 190 is given , @xmath53 , from the mgii broad emission line . according to @xcite , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the line luminosity .",
    "this 3c 190 line estimate agrees with the ir estimate , consistent with an attenuated line of sight toward the accretion disk but not towards the low ionization broad line region .",
    "the main reason for including 3c 190 is the rather steep uv spectral index of pks 1018@xmath342 .",
    "this might raise some concerns about a heavily obscured accretion flow that is skewing the estimate of @xmath29 .",
    "we note that the mgii line estimator agrees with the uv continuum estimate for pks 1018 - 42 .",
    "even though this is strongly supportive of the uv estimate of @xmath29 , a space based ir measurement would be definitive .",
    "in this letter , we have investigated radio images of a very powerful quasar pks 1018@xmath342 that is not well known due to its southerly declination .",
    "however , pks 1018 - 42 is extraordinarily powerful with jets over twice as powerful as any 3cr source of equal or lesser redshift except for one ( 3c196 ) and is certainly worthy of more detailed study .",
    "we found that it is kinetically dominated with @xmath56 .",
    "it is the fourth most kinetically dominated quasar that we could verify from existing radio maps .",
    "we showed in table 3 that kinetic dominance is a particularly rare circumstance for quasars .",
    "this is consistent with the study of 7c sources in @xcite that was based on estimating @xmath30 from oii narrow line emission .",
    "the oii narrow lines are very distant from the central quasar and it is not clear how much jet propagation excites narrow line emission ( see @xcite for one of many examples of narrow line emission that is stimulated by jet propagation ) . using the uv luminosity from the central quasar directly as we have done is far more reliable , especially when verified independently with ir and broad line data as was done above .",
    "thus , our results are consistent with @xcite , but they are found from an independent and perhaps more scientifically justified method . however , table 3 is incomplete because the most likely large @xmath29 candidates are high redshift 3c narrow line galaxies and the current @xmath57 sensitivity required for these estimates is not available , just loose bounds on the flux density @xcite .",
    "even if there are some kinetically dominated high z radio galaxies , this should not change the conclusion drawn from table 3 that large values of @xmath29 , such as for pks 1018@xmath342 , are unusual for quasars .",
    "the rarity of large @xmath29 sources follows from the steep luminosity distributions for fr ii quasars , @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "a value of @xmath60 requires @xmath61 which is already at the high end of the steep kinetic luminosity distribution and these sources are rare . yet",
    ", the complete absence of @xmath62 sources still seems unexpected because @xmath16 is a measure of the long term activity of the radio source over @xmath63 years and so it is not contemporaneous with the thermal emission from the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the timescale for the extended emission is so long , it would seem that there must be sources in which the accretion engine has long since shutoff in spite of powerful radio lobe emission 100 kpc away .",
    "where are the @xmath11fossil@xmath12 sources with @xmath64 and the accretion flow almost shutoff , @xmath65 ? perhaps some can be found as distant , @xmath66 , 3c narrow line galaxies with improved ir sensitivity .",
    "the spitzer ir telescope is ideal for looking for such hidden kinetically dominated quasars .",
    "pks 1018 - 42 would be an interesting source for the spitzer telescope , in order to verify its standing in table 3 .",
    "however , spitzer observations to date have not added any new sources to table 3 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the absence of such sources might tell us something about the fundamental nature of the quasar jet central engine .",
