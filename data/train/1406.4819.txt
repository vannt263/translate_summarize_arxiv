    "<S> the qpc geometry enables inter - boundary tunneling processes allowing for the coupling among states with different helicity , while the tight confinement in the qpc region activates charging effects leading to the coulomb blockade physics . </S>",
    "<S> peculiar signatures of these effects are theoretically investigated using a scattering field theory modified to take into account the electron - electron interaction within a self - consistent mean - field approach . </S>",
