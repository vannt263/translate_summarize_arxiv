    "one of the goals of lattice gauge theory is a thorough investigation of the phase diagram of qcd in the temperature - chemical potential plane .",
    "considerable progress has been made in simulating lattice qcd at nonzero temperature @xcite , but there has been little progress in understanding the theory at nonzero chemical potential @xmath1 even though a sound lattice formulation was presented twelve years ago @xcite .",
    "one expects on the basis of elementary physics arguments @xcite that as the chemical potential @xmath1 increases qcd will experience a transition to a quark - gluon plasma at one - third the mass of the proton , and that the chiral condensate will serve as an order parameter .",
    "the basic difficulty in simulating qcd at finite density and investigating the transition quantitatively is that the effective action resulting from the grassmann integration over the fermions is _ complex _ due to the introduction of the chemical potential in the dirac matrix .",
    "the standard simulation algorithms @xcite for lattice qcd with dynamical fermions do not apply to this situation . in order to avoid the determinant , early simulations used the quenched approximation , but they led to an unphysical value of the critical chemical potential @xmath0 , namely , its proportionality to the pion mass @xcite .",
    "the physical and mathematical reasons for this failure have been the subject of considerable debate @xcite .",
    "recent work by m. stephanov @xcite , however , has shown that the quenched model is the @xmath2 limit of a theory with both quarks and conjugate quarks , and is not relevant to qcd with dynamical fermions . here",
    "we wish to advocate a new approach to simulating qcd with dynamical fermions at nonzero chemical potential which has two unique features .",
    "first , we approach the chiral limit of lattice qcd by adding a four - fermi term to its action but setting the bare masses of the quarks to zero .",
    "the four - fermi term is a perturbatively irrelevant interaction so it does not have an effect on the values of physical quantities in the theory s continuum limit .",
    "however , in the new algorithm , called @xmath3qcd @xcite , the dynamical mass of the quark enters its propagator directly and makes the limit of massless quarks more accessible , as we will see below .",
    "the physics of massless goldstone pions can be studied in @xmath3qcd without the need for extrapolation . in addition , the algorithm runs one to two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional one because a physical quantity , the dynamical quark mass rather than the bare lattice mass , controls the convergence of the inversion of the quark propagator , the most time consuming step in the procedure .",
    "@xmath3qcd approaches the chiral limit of qcd in a different direction than the standard action and appears to avoid some of its problems .",
    "second , the fermion determinant is calculated exactly at any @xmath1 and any bare quark mass @xmath4 , given a configuration produced by the @xmath3qcd algorithm at vanishing @xmath1 and any other @xmath4 .",
    "this can be done because of the simple way @xmath4 and @xmath1 enter the theory s action .",
    "a large ensemble of configurations will generally be needed to produce observables at nonzero @xmath1 values with acceptable statistical errors .",
    "preliminary simulations of the method have been successful and will be presented below .",
    "consider qcd with a chiral 4-fermion interaction , @xmath3qcd @xcite .",

    "we consider a theory where the 4-fermion operator has the @xmath16 flavor symmetry generated by @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this lagrangian describes 8 flavors .",
    "for @xmath18 which is not a multiple of 8 we use `` noisy '' fermions @xcite and multiply the fermion kinetic term by @xmath19 .    the dirac operator of standard lattice qcd becomes singular as @xmath20 .",
    "however , inspecting eq .",
    "2 , we see that in @xmath3qcd the dirac operator remains non - singular at @xmath21 because the auxiliary field @xmath14 develops a vacuum expectation value due to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "conjugate gradient inversion of the regular qcd dirac operator requires a number of iterations which diverges as @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "inversion of the @xmath3qcd dirac operator requires a finite number of iterations even at @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , the scale of the time step in the molecular dynamics algorithm of @xmath3qcd is set by the dynamical quark mass and can be chosen several times larger here than in the ordinary lattice qcd algorithm , for the same systematic error @xcite or acceptance rate @xcite .    in order to circumvent the difficulty of investigating the finite - density transition for dynamical fermions",
    ", we build on the method of reference @xcite .",
    "the method was inspired by the classic work of yang and lee @xcite who showed that the distribution of the zeros of a partition function determines the equation of state for a many - body system .",
    "for an ising model in a magnetic field and for a lattice gas , it was shown that the zeros of the corresponding partition function lie on a unit circle in the complex fugacity plane . for",
    "a finite system these zeros will never lie in the physical range for the fugacity , namely the positive real axis .",
    "however , for a temperature below the phase transition , they will approach the real axis as the volume of the system tends to infinity .",
    "the singularities of the free energy in the thermodynamical limit are therefore obtained as the infinite - volume extrapolation of the zeros of the partition function .",
    "a detailed investigation of the finite - size scaling of the zeros enables one to evaluate the order of the phase transition and the critical exponent for the order parameter @xcite .",
    "this proposed study of lattice qcd at finite density is based on expanding the grand canonical partition function ( gcpf ) as a polynomial in the fugacity variable ( @xmath24 ) where @xmath25 is the temporal extent of the lattice .",
    "the gcpf is given as an ensemble average of the determinant of the dirac operator normalised with respect to the determinant at @xmath26 : @xmath27[du^\\dagger]\\det \\hat{m}(\\mu)\\det m(\\mu)e^{-s_g[u , u^\\dagger]}}\\over { \\int [ du][du^\\dagger]\\det \\hat{m}(\\mu=0)\\det m(\\mu=0)e^{-s_g[u , u^\\dagger]}}}\\ ] ] the dirac fermion matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 are given by : @xmath30 where @xmath31 g contains all the spacelike links and v all the forward timelike links .",
    "the determinant of the dirac operator is complex ( for @xmath32 ) in the @xmath33 case because @xmath34 favors forward propagation through eq . 4 while @xmath35 hinders backward propagation @xcite .",
    "the determinants of the fermion matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 are related to that of the propagator matrix @xcite @xmath36 by @xmath37 and @xmath38 on an @xmath39 lattice .",
    "since the eigenvalues of @xmath40 have a @xmath41 symmetry ( since @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath42 ) and because the complex conjugate configuration is equally probable in the ensemble average , the gcpf can be expanded as @xmath43 the @xmath44 are determined from the eigenvalues of @xmath45 .    for @xmath46 , the tunneling between the different @xmath47 vacua should eliminate the triality non - zero coefficients . in the simulations described below we do observe strong cancellations in these coefficients for @xmath48 around zero .",
    "the zeros of this polynomial are the lee - yang zeros in the complex fugacity plane .",
    "their distribution and behaviour with respect to finite volume scaling will be discussed in a future publication .",
    "we consider a description of the system in terms of the canonical partition functions for fixed particle number@xcite .",
    "the chemical potential as a function of the baryon number density is obtained from the local derivative of the energy , @xmath49 , of the state with @xmath50 fermions with respect to @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51    where @xmath52 is the fermion density , @xmath53 .",
    "although some of the @xmath49 are determined with large error and have imaginary part @xmath54 because the corresponding @xmath44 is negative ( in principle , many more measurements should give all triality zero @xmath44 positive ) , it is clear from the simulations that , for all mod(n,3)=0 , their real parts form a continuous curve in @xmath50 , as shown in fig . 1 .    with this assumption we made a cubic spline fit to a randomly selected subset of @xmath55 of the @xmath56 @xmath49 s with triality zero and evaluated the derivative .",
    "this process was performed @xmath55 times and an estimate of the fitting error and the mean estimated from the distribution of the corresponding @xmath57 resulted .",

    "2 we show strong gauge coupling ( @xmath58 ) results of the induced fermion number vs. chemical potential @xmath1 on a @xmath59 lattice at various four - fermi couplings @xmath60 . since the pion is strictly massless in these simulations and since @xmath0 is distinctly nonzero for each parameter choice , the simulation is not afflicted by the diseases of the quenched standard action . in fact , for large @xmath60 where the action reduces to the usual lattice qcd action , mean field analyses @xcite , which should be reliable at strong gauge coupling , predict @xmath0 near 0.60 , in rough agreement with our figure .",
    "next we simulated a weaker gauge coupling in order to approach the continuum limit of the theory and test the simulation method more strenuously .",
    "we chose @xmath61 for various @xmath60 on a larger @xmath62 lattice .",
    "simulations at zero @xmath1 were performed and measurements of the chiral condensate and heavy quark potential indicated a finite temperature quark gluon plasma transition between @xmath60 of 5.0 and 6.0 .",
    "( at @xmath63 we measured @xmath64 and the wilson line @xmath65 , while at @xmath66 we found @xmath67 and @xmath68 . )",
    "the task for our new algorithm was to find this transition and measure the critical chemical potentials in the cold hadronic phase for @xmath60 below 5.0 and do the same in the hot plasma phase for @xmath60 above 6.0 .",
    "our simulation results , shown in fig .",
    "3 , show this transition very clearly  for @xmath60 of 5.0 and smaller the @xmath0 is above 0.50 , while at @xmath66 @xmath0 falls abruptly to zero , indicating the presence of unconfined , massless quarks . clearly , this estimate of @xmath0 is crude .",
    "simulations of simpler models on much larger lattices @xcite suggests that the tails in the curves in fig .",
    "3 are finite size effects .",
    "the finite temperature transition of @xmath3qcd is being studied on larger lattices for @xmath69 at variable @xmath70 and more observables are being measured @xcite to obtain quantitative predictions for pure qcd .",
    "preliminary measurements , on @xmath59 and @xmath62 lattices , of the fermion energy density and condensate using the stochastic estimator method and including the ratio of the determinants of the dirac operator at @xmath1 to that at @xmath26 are consistent with the behaviour of the number density found by the above method .    at the present time extension to larger lattices is limited by the algorithm used to determine the eigenvalues of the propagator matrix .",
    "the cpu time and storage , to a first approximation , scale as @xmath71 but are independent of @xmath72 .",
    "the algorithm has been successfully implemented on an @xmath73 lattice and should be viable on a @xmath74 lattice at its present stage of development .",
    "clearly much more work along these lines is called for  much larger lattices must be used to extract continuum physics .",
    "although in principle the four fermi term is irrelevant and the value of @xmath60 should not effect the values of observables in physical units in the continuum limit , practical simulations on finite lattices should be done with the four fermi coupling sufficiently small .",
    "this issue is discussed briefly in @xcite , but more quantitative work is needed and is underway .",
    "nonetheless , the method has passed several nontrivial tests which we find encouraging .",
    "we are also hopeful that @xmath3qcd can be used to improve the action of lattice qcd , speed up spectroscopy and matrix element calculations of conventional hadronic phenomenology , and determine the universality class of the finite temperature hadronic matter / quark gluon plasma transition @xcite @xcite .",
    "an algorithm which runs directly in the chiral limit will be very helpful here .",
