    "the possibility of studying the physical parameters of the distant universe using gravitational lenses ( gl ) was first suggested in the 1960s . in particular ,",
    "refsdal ( 1964 , 1966 ) suggested that one could determine the masses of galaxies and the hubble constant using the observed image properties , most notably their positions , magnifications and time delays between images of the same source .",
    "the latter became especially interesting after the time delay in the system 0957 + 561 was measured ( e.g. vanderriest et al . 1989 ; leh ' ar et al .",
    "1992 ) and a value of @xmath0 derived ( rhee 1991 ; roberts et al . 1991 ) .",
    "alcock & anderson ( 1985 , 1986 ) , watanabe , sasaki & tomita ( 1992 ) and sasaki ( 1993 ) criticized the method , arguing that large scale structure ( lss ) might significantly affect the time delay .",
    "unfortunately , their arguments were only qualitative and could not give realistic predictions of the amplitude of fluctuations .",
    "for example , falco , gorenstein & shapiro ( 1991 ) found that the effect alcock & anderson discussed can change the derived value of @xmath0 by only a few percent . in light of this",
    "many workers in the field have taken an optimistic view and assumed that the derived value of @xmath0 gives at least an upper limit to the actual value ( e.g. borgeest & refsdal 1984 ) .",
    "these arguments are based on the fact that mass density is always positive and therefore always focuses the rays .",
    "however , this is only correct in newtonian gravity and becomes invalid in cosmological applications , where underdensities such as voids give an effective negative mass density ( e.g. nityananda & ostriker 1984 ) . in general",
    ", the question whether lss could significantly affect the measured properties of the lens has remained largely unanswered .",
    "in this paper we present a calculation of position and time delay dispersions in a gl system .",
    "the calculation is done using linearized general relativity for some realistic _ cobe _ normalized cosmological models . in ",
    "2 we present the method , based on the geodesic equation for a perturbed robertson - walker metric .",
    "a similar approach has been used by linder ( 1990 ) and cay ' on , mart ' inez - gonz ' alez & sanz ( 1993a , 1993b ) to study the gl effects on the cosmic microwave background and by kaiser ( 1992 ) to derive the ellipticity correlation function of distant galaxies .",
    "an alternative method , based on optical scalars , has been developed by gunn ( 1967 ) and applied to the ellipticity and magnification correlation function calculations by babul & lee ( 1991 ) , blandford et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and miralda - escud ' e ( 1991 ) . in ",
    "3 we apply the method to compute the fluctuations in the image position relative to the true position and relative to another image position . in ",
    "4 we present the calculation of fluctuations in time delay . in  5 we present the conclusions and comment on their agreement with previous work on this subject .",
    "our framework is a perturbed flat robertson - walker model with small - amplitude scalar metric fluctuations . in the longitudinal gauge ( bardeen 1980 ;",
    "mukhanov , feldman and brandenberger 1992 ) one can write the line element as @xmath1\\ . \\label{metric}\\ ] ] we assume that @xmath2 and neglect all the terms of order @xmath3 ) and higher .",
    "this is a good approximation almost everywhere in the universe , except near black holes .",
    "we adopt units such that @xmath4 . in the line element above we neglected the contributions from vector and tensor modes and the gravitational effects from anisotropic stresses . these approximations are valid nearly always , especially in the regime of interest for us , which is the matter dominated era with fluctuation wavelengths small compared to the hubble distance . in this case",
    "@xmath5 can be interpreted as the newtonian potential and , neglecting the contributions from wavelengths larger than the hubble distance , it obeys the cosmological poisson equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the local density and @xmath8 the mean density in the universe ( e.g. bertschinger 1993 ) .",
    "we denote the time dependence of the potential with @xmath9 , which is independent of the scale in linear perturbation theory , assuming the dominant matter component has negligible jeans length .",
    "for the zero curvature model with a cosmological constant , @xmath10 , one has ( heath 1977 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; we normalize @xmath14 to @xmath15 today .",
    "@xmath0 is the hubble constant and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the matter and vacuum densities , respectively , in units of the critical density .",
    "the simplest model has @xmath18 , for which @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "suppose a photon is emitted from a distant source toward the observer ( see figure [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "if there are no perturbations present the photon will travel along a null geodesic in the radial direction , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the conformal time today . adding a perturbation changes the photon trajectory into @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the excursion of the photon in the direction orthogonal to @xmath26 .",
    "the 3-tangent to the geodesic curve is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the comoving path length along the geodesic .",
    "null geodesics obey the relation @xmath29 .",
    "even when metric perturbations are present , we can continue to parametrize the geodesic with the unperturbed radial coordinate @xmath30 .",
    "the relation between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 .",
    "the linearized space part of the photon geodesic equation derived from the metric in equation ( [ metric ] ) gives the rate of change in photon direction , @xmath33 ( e.g. weinberg 1972 eq .",
    "9.2.6 - 7 ; note that there is a factor of 2 missing in eq .",
    "for weak gravitational fields ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath5 can be viewed as providing a force deflecting the photons and affecting their travel time while they propagate through unperturbed space - time .",
    "we shall adopt this quasi - newtonian interpretation throughout this paper .    because @xmath35 is normalized , it is sufficient to consider only its two components orthogonal to @xmath26 .",
    "we define the two - dimensional photon direction angle @xmath36 $ ] relative to the unperturbed photon direction @xmath37 ( taken as the third direction ) as @xmath38 .",
    "we assume small deflection angles ( this will be justified in  3 ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the initial photon direction ( here @xmath42 is the comoving distance between the observer and the source ) and @xmath43 $ ] is a two - dimensional deflection angle produced by the potential along the geodesic between the source and the point under consideration at @xmath30 . from equation ( [ dndl ] )",
    "follows @xmath44 we introduced @xmath45 defined as @xmath46=-2[{\\bf \\nabla}-\\bi{\\widehat{r}}({\\bf \\nabla } \\cdot \\bi{\\widehat{r}})]\\phi[\\bi{x}(r),\\tau(r)].\\ ] ] the photon excursion in the plane perpendicular to @xmath26 is given by @xmath47 the initial photon direction @xmath41 must be chosen so that @xmath48 , i.e. , the ray must pass through the observer s position .",
    "this gives the lens equation @xmath49 or @xmath50 this lens equation is valid for an arbitrary mass distribution between the source and the observer .",
    "it can not be solved explicitly in general , because @xmath51 depends on the unknown initial photon direction @xmath41 .",
    "instead , one has to solve an integral equation using , for example , the ray - shooting method .",
    "we may also ask what is the photon direction at the observer s position so that @xmath52 .",
    "this is given by the image position angles @xmath53 . for the special case of a single thin lens one",
    "has @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the bending angle in the lens plane and @xmath56 is the comoving distance between the observer and the lens .",
    "equation ( [ lenseq ] ) then gives @xmath57 which is the usual lens equation in the thin lens approximation ( e.g. schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ; blandford & kochanek 1987 ) .",
    "here @xmath58 is the comoving distance between the observer and the source and @xmath59 .",
    "the distances can be calculated for a given cosmological model from the source redshift @xmath60 and lens redshift @xmath61 ( assuming that the two redshifts can be measured ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath18 one has @xmath62 $ ] and @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "we use the unperturbed comoving distance - redshift relation , because the deviations from it are @xmath64 and can be neglected to the first order . note that we expressed the lens equation using comoving distances .",
    "one can reexpress it , if one wishes , with angular diameter distances using the relation @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the redshift of the source and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are , respectively , the angular diameter distance and comoving distance between the point a and the source .",
    "similarly , the net time delay along the photon path relative to the unperturbed path is given by @xmath69dr \\approx \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\int_0^{r_{os}}\\biggl [ { 1 \\over 2}\\bi{\\gamma}^2(r)- 2\\phi[\\bi{x}(r),\\tau(r)]\\biggl]dr , \\label{tdgen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and we used the small angle approximation ; the unperturbed null geodesic equation may be used for @xmath71 . the first and second term in equation ( [ tdgen ] ) are the geometrical and gravitational ( also called potential or shapiro ) time delay contribution , respectively .",
    "again , for the particular case of the thin lens approximation this reproduces the usual time delay equation , as shown in  4 .",
    "although we have derived our equations using the geodesic equations of a perturbed robertson - walker metric , the final expressions agree with the usual thin lens equations , when we interpret @xmath5 as the newtonian potential , obeying equation [ poisson ] .",
    "in addition , one does not have to assume that density perturbations are small , as long as @xmath2 .",
    "these are advantages of the longitudinal gauge compared to other gauge choices ( e.g. synchronous gauge ) .",
    "the particular strength of the approach presented here is that it remains valid in cosmological applications and can give the deflection angle and time delay due to any matter distribution between the source and observer .",
    "use of comoving coordinates and conformal time greatly simplifies the gl equations .",
    "in particular , all the equations above use a simple euclidean spatial geometry and there is no need to use angular distances or worry about expansion factors .",
    "the general expressions above would be more cumbersome when expressed with angular diameter distances .",
    "we are interested in lss effects on the image properties of lenses .",
    "because of the statistical nature of cosmological theories one can only predict the ensemble averages of a given quantity , such as its mean and variance .",
    "all the gl effects are given through the gravitational potential @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "its statistical properties can best be described with the fourier transformed potential @xmath73 , @xmath74=\\int d^3k \\phi(\\bi{k})e^{i\\bi{k\\cdot x}}f[\\tau(r ) ] .",
    "\\label{ft}\\ ] ] the ensemble mean and variance of the fourier transform of the potential are @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the power spectrum of the potential ( see e.g. bertschinger 1992 ) . we will use the power spectrum of the potential in this paper because it leads to the simplest expressions , but note that one can easily reexpress the results with the density power spectrum using equation [ poisson ] .",
    "a particularly convenient normalization of @xmath77 is given by the cosmic microwave background anisotropy measured by _",
    "cobe _ - the quadrupole @xmath78 ( smoot et al . 1992 ; seljak & bertschinger 1993 ) . on the large scales probed by _",
    "cobe _ the dominant contribution to @xmath79 is given by the sachs - wolfe ( 1967 ) effect , induced by the same metric fluctuations that cause the fluctuations in time delay and image positions .",
    "assuming no tensor mode contribution to cmb anisotropies and isentropic ( adiabatic ) fluctuations we can express the quadrupole in terms of the power spectrum of the potential ( bond & efsthathiou 1987 ) as @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the spherical bessel function of order 2 and @xmath82 is the amplification coefficient due to the time dependent potential ( kofman & starobinsky 1985 ) . if @xmath18 the potential is time independent and @xmath83 . for the scale - invariant peebles - harrison - zeldovich spectrum @xmath84 one gets @xmath85",
    "the first question we will ask is what is the rms fluctuation in the photon direction at the observer s position relative to the unperturbed direction .",
    "this is defined as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the total deflection angle accumulated between the source and the observer , as defined in equation ( [ gamdef ] ) . in order to compute the variance",
    "we will make an additional assumption that the statistical properties of the potential sampled by the perturbed photon geodesic are approximately equal to those along the unperturbed one , @xmath88 \\phi[\\bi{x},\\tau(r ) ] \\rangle \\approx   \\langle \\phi[r\\bi{\\widehat{r}},\\tau(r ) ] \\phi[r\\bi{\\widehat{r}},\\tau(r ) ] \\rangle .",

    "is usually satisfied in most models of lss for sources at cosmological distances .",
    "no assumption on the power spectrum has been made and equation [ limber ] can be used both in linear and in non - linear regime . to compute the variance",
    "@xmath95 we use the above expression with @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . assuming linear evolution and @xmath18 we obtain @xmath99    the rms fluctuation in photon direction at the distance @xmath42 from the source , @xmath95 , is related to the rms angular fluctuation of the true source position relative to the observed position . to compute this we have to back - propagate all the photons with a fixed final direction and ask what are their angular excursions in the source plane , @xmath100\\cdot \\biggl [ { 1\\over r_{os}}\\int_0^{r_{os}}\\bi{\\alpha_{\\perp}}(0,r)dr \\biggl ] \\biggl\\rangle^{1/2}. \\label{sth}\\ ] ] integrating by parts the two terms in equation ( [ sth ] ) we find that @xmath101 is given by a similar expression as @xmath95 with @xmath102 . using equation [ varalphafinal ] gives @xmath103    to get some intuition about the scaling of the amplitude with the parameters we will present an estimate of the fluctuations for a particularly simple power spectrum approximating inflationary models with a physical transfer function : @xmath104 the spectral indices have been chosen to agree with the cold dark matter model in the limits of small and large @xmath105 . applying this power spectrum to equations",
    "( [ varalphafinal ] ) and ( [ vargammafinal ] ) we find @xmath106 this result has a simple physical interpretation . for power spectra like in equation ( [ ps ] )",
    "the dominant contribution to gravitational deflection of light comes from the scales near the turnover position @xmath107 .",
    "a photon travelling through a coherent structure of size @xmath107 will be deflected by @xmath108 , where the last relation assumes @xmath5 is scale invariant for @xmath109 and is therefore fixed by the sachs - wolfe effect on the hubble distance scale .",
    "each region of size @xmath107 makes an independent contribution to the deflection .",
    "since the individual contributions are random , the photon exhibits a random walk with @xmath110 , where @xmath111 .",
    "numerical factors aside this agrees with equation ( [ varsimple ] ) . a reasonable value for the turnover position in the power spectrum is given by @xmath112 mpc .",
    "taking @xmath113 gpc as a typical source distance we find @xmath114 .",
    "this is small compared to 1 , which justifies the small deflection angle assumption .",
    "it also verifies that the pathlengths are not significantly lengthened by the perturbations .",
    "however , we conclude that the fluctuations in the angular position @xmath101 are of the order of arcminutes ( see also linder 1990 ) , which means that the true positions of distant objects in the universe , such as quasars , differ from the measured positions on average ( rms ) by this amount .",
    "these fluctuations arise already because of the linear structures ( voids and superclusters ) and are present even when there are no nonlinear objects ( like galaxies and clusters ) intersecting the photon trajectories .",
    "the fluctuations are much larger than a typical image separation in a lens system , which is of the order of a few arcseconds .",
    "the large total deflections are not directly observable in a single lens system , because only the relative positions of images can be measured .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows photon propagation in a typical two image gl system . despite the fact that the deflection of any single photon ray can be large",
    ", the lens equation will still give the same solution as in the unperturbed case , provided that lss deflects the two photons approximately by the same amount .",
    "this will be examined below .",
    "although the deflection of a photon ray relative to the unperturbed direction is not directly observable from the positions , one might worry that it could produce significant time delay fluctuations .",
    "we will address this question in  4 .",
    "let us now calculate lss effects on the relative image positions , by calculating @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the dispersion in the relative direction and in the relative angular position separation between two image rays .",
    "we will denote the two rays with @xmath117 and @xmath118 , separated in direction at the observer s position by an angle @xmath119 , where the orientation of the coordinate system was chosen so that the image separation vector lies in the direction @xmath120 ( so that @xmath121 ) .",
    "we divide the potential into a stochastic part , which describes the lss , and a non - stochastic part describing the primary lensing object .",
    "we assume there are no correlations between these two parts . taking the expectation value of equation ( [ lenseq ] )",
    "the stochastic contributions average to 0 and we obtain the usual lens equation in the thin lens approximation .",
    "the difference between the two direction vectors caused by lss between the lens and the observer is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the lss caused deflections for the rays @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "we excluded the non - stochastic deflection from the primary lens itself .",

    "assuming in addition that the scales contributing to the fluctuations are much larger than the typical separation between the two rays ( one can always verify this assumption by evaluating @xmath115 from equation [ limber ] ) , we obtain @xmath129^{1/2}.   \\label{dtfinal}\\ ] ] replacing @xmath125 with @xmath130 and @xmath56 with @xmath58 in equation [ dtfinal ] gives the rms fluctuation between the two ray directions accumulated between the source and the lens .",
    "summing the two contributions in quadrature gives the rms fluctuation accumulated between the source and the observer , neglecting the correlations between paths on either side of the lens .",
    "similarly , the dispersion of the angular position in the lens plane is given by setting @xmath131 , which gives for the contribution between the observer and lens , @xmath132    for the simple power spectrum of equation ( [ ps ] ) we find @xmath133 again , there is a simple physical explanation of this result .",
    "two photons separated by an angle @xmath125 sample different potentials , @xmath134 , including only the peak power contribution around @xmath135 .",
    "the separation @xmath136 is largest at the lens , but only falls to one - half for distances half and three - halves as far , so it is a reasonable approximation to fix @xmath30 to @xmath56 .",
    "a coherent structure of size @xmath107 leads to an angular difference of @xmath137 and there are @xmath138 random and independent contributions .",
    "the total angular difference is just an incoherent sum of individual contributions , @xmath139 , which , numerical factors aside , reproduces equation ( [ difs ] ) .    a more direct way to estimate",
    "the amplitude of image position fluctuation is to use the observations of correlated distortions of distant galaxy images .",
    "this can be described by the ellipticity correlation function @xmath140 ( blandford et al . 1991 ) , which describes the correlations in the ellipticities of galaxy images as a function of angular separation @xmath141 . the ellipticity correlation function at zero lag , @xmath142 , can be related to the power spectrum using the expression @xmath143 where we assumed for simplicity that all the galaxies lie at the same distance @xmath144 ( kaiser 1992 ; blandford et al .",

    "however , the authors could not exclude the possibility that the observed signal is due to systematic effects .",
    "this is also suggested by fahlman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who report a null detection of average ellipticity within a @xmath151 radius aperture with a sensitivity of about 1.3% , which after adjustment to @xmath144 above implies an upper limit @xmath152 .",
    "these measurements give average ellipticities in typically arcminute size windows and do not probe @xmath140 on scales below @xmath153 .",
    "observationally it is difficult to give reliable estimates on smaller scales because one has to distinguish between the signal and the noise from the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies .",
    "a rather weak upper limit on @xmath142 can be obtained simply from the average ellipticity of galaxies , which is of the order of 0.4 and is dominated by intrinsic ellipticities . despite some uncertainty from the model predictions and observations , it appears unlikely that the relative fluctuations in the image separation angle exceed a level of a few percent .",
    "the conclusion above justifies the assumption that the rms fluctuation is small compared to the measured image separation .",
    "the fact that @xmath154 also implies that one can not have multiple images produced by lss alone .",

    "( 1991 ) and using semi - analytical methods by bartelmann & schneider ( 1991 ) . the fluctuations in angular image separation , although small , are in most cases larger than the observational errors on the image positions ( typically less than 0.01 arcsecond / arcsecond @xmath155 )",
    ". therefore , lss effects are a major source of uncertainty in the true image positions .",
    "observational efforts in trying to determine the image position with precisions below 0.01 arcsecond are redundant and do not improve the lens reconstruction .",
    "this effect fundamentally limits our ability to reconstruct the lens potential using the image positions and should be included in the modelling of lens parameters , once the actual amplitude of fluctuations is determined from the ellipticity correlation function measurements .",
    "we should also justify the assumptions made in our calculations .",
    "one is that the statistical properties of the potential along the perturbed path are well approximated by those along the unperturbed path , as expressed in equation ( [ assum ] ) .",

    ". therefore , the approximation in equation ( [ assum ] ) leads to negligible errors .",
    "another approximation we used was to neglect the correlations between lss and the primary lens .",
    "this is justified because the two are correlated only over a correlation length distance , which is much smaller than the typical pathlength . while there are @xmath158 uncorrelated regions of size @xmath107 along the photon path , only one of those is strongly correlated with the primary lens .",
    "the contribution from that region can be regarded as being part of the primary lens itself .",

    "let us calculate the time delay contribution between the ray @xmath117 and the fiducial ray accumulated between the lens and the observer .",
    "the fiducial ray is defined to start perpendicular to the lens plane and end at the observer s positions .",
    "the total time delay is obtained by adding a similar contribution from the lens to the source and subtracting the same terms for the ray @xmath118 .",
    "the fiducial ray direction is given by @xmath176 where @xmath45 is computed along the fiducial ray .",
    "the direction of the ray a is @xmath177 here @xmath178 is the difference between the lss induced ray deflections at @xmath30 and can be calculated using the taylor expansion of @xmath179 around the fiducial ray , as we did in  3 .",
    "the image ray position relative to the fiducial ray is @xmath180 the initial lens plane position of the image ray relative to the fiducial ray , @xmath181 , is not a free parameter , since it has to satisfy the constraint @xmath182 from this we obtain @xmath183    the gravitational time delay contribution is obtained from the taylor expansion of the potential around the fiducial ray , @xmath184\\right\\}dr .",
    "\\label{dtgra}\\ ] ] the geometrical time delay contribution is given by @xmath185dr   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\bi{(\\gamma}^{out , a})^2r_{ol } \\over 2 } +   \\int_0^{r_{ol}}\\biggl [ \\bi{\\gamma^f}(r)\\cdot \\bi{\\gamma}^{out , a }   + \\bi{\\gamma^f}(r ) \\cdot \\delta \\bi{\\alpha}^a_{\\perp }   ( r , r_{ol } )   \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\bi{\\gamma}^{out , a } \\cdot   \\delta \\bi{\\alpha}^a_{\\perp } ( r , r_{ol } ) + { \\delta \\bi{\\alpha}^a_{\\perp }   ( r , r_{ol})^2 \\over 2}\\biggl]dr.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating by parts the terms involving @xmath186 we find @xmath187dr= \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\int_0^{r_{ol}}\\left\\{\\bi{g_{\\perp}}(r ) \\cdot \\int_0^r[\\bi{\\gamma}^{out , a } + \\delta \\bi{\\alpha}^a_{\\perp } ( r',r_{ol})]dr'\\right\\}dr.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is exactly cancelled by the first order term in @xmath188 ( equation [ dtgra ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath189 completely drops out of the time delay expression and using time delay measurements we can not infer any information on the absolute deflection angle .",
    "this is quite remarkable , given that separately the geometrical and gravitational lss induced fluctuations are approximately @xmath190 , much larger than the expected time delay from the primary lens itself , of the order of @xmath191 .    adding the geometrical and gravitational time delay contributions we finally obtain @xmath192dr . \\label{tdp}\\ ] ] the first term in equation ( [ tdp ] ) gives the largest contribution and is the term that one would also have in the absence of lss ( compare with equation [ tdtl ] ) .",
    "the second term is smaller than the first term approximately by @xmath193 .",
    "the last two terms in equation ( [ tdp ] ) are further suppressed by @xmath194 relative to the second term and can be neglected .    what , then , is the lss induced fluctuation that causes the reconstructed time delay to differ from the true time delay ?",
    "the observer measures the image separation angle that is almost , but not exactly , given by @xmath195 , so that the reconstructed time delay differs somewhat from equation ( [ tdtl ] ) .",
    "it is not possible to give an exact prediction of the reconstructed time delay without specifying the detailed lens model and taking into account all of the observational constraints .",
    "it is clear , however , that the fluctuation in the reconstructed time delay is due only to the fluctuation in the relative angle separation , part of which is described by the second term in equation ( [ tdp ] ) . given that @xmath196 , the relative effects on the time delay will also be of that order .",
    "we conclude that the time delay fluctuation induced by lss is of the order of @xmath197 , which is of the order of a few percent for sources and lenses at cosmological distances .",
    "we investigated the lss effects on measurable properties of gravitational lens systems , in particular on the image positions and time delays .",
    "the method we use is based on a geodesic equation in a weakly perturbed flat robertson - walker metric and is valid for a general matter distribution between the source and the observer .",
    "the advantage of this approach compared to previous work on this subject is that it only assumes the knowledge of evolution of density power spectrum , which can easily be related to other measurements of lss to obtain quantitative predictions .",
    "the same approach can also be used to calculate light propagation in non - flat universes and the conclusions in this paper do not significantly depend on the assumed value of @xmath198 .",
    "we find that the rms fluctuation in the relative positions of images is @xmath199 , for a lss density power spectrum peaking at wavelength @xmath135 . for most realistic models of lss",
    "this is much smaller than unity and so one does not expect multiple images generated from lss .",
    "nevertheless , these fluctuations are likely to be larger than the observational errors and should be included in the modelling of lens parameters .",
    "similarly , rms fluctuation in time delay due to lss are caused only by the uncertainties in the relative image positions and are also approximately given by @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , lss does not significantly affect the time delays .",
    "while the same method can be used to predict fluctuations in the relative image magnification and orientation , a simple estimate shows that the effect on these observables is negligible .",
    "the rms fluctuation in relative magnification between two images @xmath201 is given approximately by @xmath202 , well below the measurement errors .",
    "the conclusion regarding lss effects on time delay measurements disagrees with the conclusions reached by alcock & anderson ( 1985 , 1986 ) , watanabe et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and sasaki ( 1993 ) .",
    "sasaki ( 1993 ) suggests that the coupling between the absolute and relative deflection , which in our language is proportional to @xmath203 , generates large time delay fluctuations . as we have shown in  4 , this term actually vanishes once both the gravitational and geometrical time delay contributions",
    "are included .",
    "alcock & anderson ( 1985 , 1986 ) , watanabe et al . (",
    "1992 ) and sasaki ( 1993 ) have argued that although the universe is homogeneous on large scales , individual photons may travel through a region where the density differs from the average density in the universe .",
    "if one assumes that the density in the beam is some constant fraction of the average density , then one can use the dyer - roeder angular distance redshift relation ( see sasaki 1993 for a comprehensive discussion ) to deduce the value of the hubble constant .",
    "the result depends on the unknown density in the beam and one may conclude that this significantly affects the hubble constant determination from the time delay measurements .",
    "for example , alcock & anderson ( 1985 , 1986 ) argue that because of lss correlations there may be a significant overdensity in the particular direction of the lens .",
    "this conclusion neglects the fact that lss and the primary lens are correlated over only a correlation length distance , which is typically much smaller than the photon travel distance .",
    "similarly , watanabe et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and sasaki ( 1993 ) argue that we might live in a universe where part or all of the mass is concentrated in small clumps away from the photon beam , which are unable to significantly affect the light propagation .",
    "both descriptions of lss are oversimplified in that they do not account for the stochastic nature of lss .",
    "dynamical measurements over the last decade show large amounts of dark matter present on all scales and so one can not assume that photons are travelling through a uniformly filled or empty beam when away from the primary lens .",
    "moreover , the average redshift - angular distance relation should not differ from the homogeneous case , once we average over all lines of sight ( including those through the clumps of matter ) .",
    "if redshift - angular distance relation for most lines of sight is to differ significantly from that in the homogeneous universe , then this requires large rms fluctuation around the mean .",
    "this would imply large @xmath204 but , as we argued in  3 , no such large fluctuations are either expected or observed .",
    "therefore , the use of angular distances as given by the homogeneous universe model appears to be adequate .",
    "another reason for the disagreement with watanabe et al .",
    "( 1992 ) is that these authors assumed a large contribution to the fluctuations from small ( galactic ) scales .",
    "as we argued , the data at present show little support for such a large contribution on those scales , although for a more quantitative prediction better measurements of power spectrum on small ( subarcminute ) scales would be needed .",
    "if lss does not induce significant time delay fluctuations , then this would remove one of the major objections against using time delay measurements to determine @xmath0 .",
    "significant problems related to the robustness of the lens reconstructions still remain and are preventing the method at present from giving a reliable estimate of @xmath0 ( see e.g. bernstein , tyson & kochanek 1993 for a discussion of lens reconstruction in 0957 + 561 ) . moreover",
    ", the above analysis does not exclude the possibility that a homogeneous sheet of matter is present in the lens plane , because in our treatment this sheet of matter is part of the primary lens .",
    "uniform matter distribution , which is likely to be overdense close to the primary lens , can not be determined from the image positions , but it does affect the length scale and makes the deduced value of hubble constant larger than the true value ( borgeest & refsdal 1984 ; falco , gorenstein & shapiro 1991 ) . although severe , these problems are not unsolvable and gl time delay method remains one of the few methods that can provide information on the global distance scale and geometry of the universe .",
