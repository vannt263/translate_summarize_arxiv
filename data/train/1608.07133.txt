    "episodic x - ray burst emission from magnetars has been heretofore attributed to diverse mechanisms associated with their extreme magnetic fields ( @xmath0@xmath110@xmath2 g ) .",
    "however , the detection of magnetar - like bursts from the young , rotation powered pulsar ( rpp ) psrj@xmath3 ( gavriil et al 2008 ) , and from a magnetar with a surprisingly low magnetic field , sgr@xmath4 ( @xmath5 g ; similar to the typical surface dipole fields of ordinary rpps ; @xcite , see @xcite for bursts ) , suggested that the two populations maybe actually linked via a continuum of magnetic activity .",
    "typical magnetar bursts are brief ( @xmath6s long ) but very luminous , reaching peak luminosities of about @xmath7 erg / s @xcite .",
    "these constitute the bulk of burst activity , with a few intermediate bursts of about an order of magnitude more energetic , longer durations , and long lasting tail emission , which is much weaker than the burst but significantly above the persistent emission level ( lenters et al . 2003 , g et al .",
    "2011 , chakraborty et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed as the source of magnetar bursts ; they all assume that these are powered by their fields ( for a review see turolla , zane & watts 2015 ) .",
    "the crust quake model posits that the dissipation of internal magnetic energy strains the solid crust of the neutron star , which then fractures when the magnetic pressure on it becomes larger than the limiting stress it could resist .",
    "this is followed by particle acceleration and emission of radiation in the form of a short burst ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "this model suggests that the bursting phenomenon maybe similar to the earthquakes , and like them it might be governed by self organized criticality ( soc ) ; indeed soc behavior in bursting was observed in at least two magnetars ( g et al .",
    "1999 ; 2000 ) , lending support to the crust fracturing scenario .",
    "an alternative mechanism for bursts , again in the presence of extremely strong magnetic fields , is magnetic reconnection ( lyutikov 2003 , 2015 ) . in a simplified way ,",
    "the scales of fracturing or reconnection ( or even the combination of both processes ) are reflected in the energetics of bursts ( thompson and duncan 2001 , lyutikov 2015 ) .",
    "moreover , bursting activity sometimes affects radiative behavior of the source , e.g. , long lasting increase of the persistent x - ray flux ( rea & esposito 2011 ) .",
    "contrary to magnetars , the bulk of the neutron star population is powered via loss of their rotational energy emitting radiation as radio pulsars .",
    "rpps have a wide range of surface magnetic fields ; young objects characteristically have b - fields of about @xmath8 g. among them , there are about ten currently known systems with inferred surface magnetic strength in excess of @xmath9 g , with few as high as the typical magnetar regime ( ng & kaspi 2011 ) .",
    "it was one of these high b - field sources ( psrj1846@xmath10258 with @xmath10 g ; gavriil et al .",
    "2008 ) which was observed to emit magnetar - like x - ray bursts .",
    "interestingly , psrj1846@xmath10258 is an x - ray pulsar without observed radio emission .    is a young isolated neutron star among the group of high b - field systems , with a spin period of @xmath11s , and an inferred surface dipole field strength of @xmath1210@xmath13 g ( camilo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it is a highly energetic rotation powered object (  is @xmath1410@xmath15 erg / s ) which emits pulsed radiation in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum including gamma rays ( parent et al .",
    "another intriguing property of is that it exhibited rotating radio transient ( rrat)-like behavior following the 2007 glitch , therefore , it is the only source with glitch induced radiative magnetospheric imprints in radio wavelengths ( weltevrede , johnston , & espinoza 2011 , antonopoulou et al .",

    "the observations described below were obtained with the _ fermi_/gbm and the _ swift_/bat .",
    "the gbm is an all sky monitor on board _ fermi _ comprising 14 detectors with 8sr field of view .",

    "the duration of the burst active episode of , and clustering of bursts throughout this active phase resemble those of magnetars with low burst rates ( g 2014 ) .",
    "this unusual high field radio pulsar has thus demonstrated typical magnetar behavior .",
    "we also uncovered a burst - induced additional x - ray intensity increase which lasted about 1400 s. the enhancement is thermal in nature , with evidence of a cooling trend during the tail .",
    "burst tails with a thermal cooling trend have been seen in other magnetars : sgr 1900 + 14 ( lenters et al .",

    "these transient enhancements were interpreted as cooling of heat imparted onto or near the neutron star surface . in the other sources ,",
    "pulsed x - ray intensity was also observed to rise during the extended tail . for , x - ray observations were performed in a mode with about 2.5 s time resolution ( i.e. , about 6 times the spin period of the system ) . despite this",

    "no associated x - ray activity was reported ( swift , the only x - ray telescope observing the unocculted sky at the time , has a 4@xmath71 fluence sensitivity of 4@xmath4710@xmath72 erg @xmath31 in the 15@xmath1150 kev band ) . in its 2016 activation ,",
    "underwent another large glitch with @xmath67/@xmath68@xmath73 ( archibald et al .",
    "however the radio behavior was quite different : pulsed radio emission ceased after the bursts ( burgay et al .",
    "2016a ) , reappearing two weeks later ( burgay et al .",
    "this diversity of glitch - associated magnetospheric behaviour , manifested in both radio and gamma - ray emission , is unique .",
    "the spin recovery after the 2007 glitch was also unusual , with an over - recovery of the spin - down rate that continued to evolve on a timescale of years ( antonopoulou et al .",
    "these authors considered scenarios that could explain the unusual spin - down evolution .",
    "superfluid mechanisms include the possibility of vortices moving inwards ( akbal et al .",
    "2015 , see below ) , or variations in the strength of coupling between superfluid and normal components due to heating ( see e.g. haskell & antonopoulou 2014 ) .",
    "magnetospheric changes , caused by crustquakes and/or the superfluid dissipation from the glitch , were required to explain the change in radio behavior , but could in principle also explain the subsequent spin evolution .",
    "the new observations of bursts reported in this paper indicate that rapid magnetospheric rearrangements , most likely magnetic reconnection , can also take place in this source . whether the bursts are triggered by crustquakes , or by magnetospheric instabilities ,",
    "is an open theoretical question ( turolla , zane & watts 2015 ) .",
    "how this additional facet of the star s behavior fits into the models considered by antonopoulou et al .",
    "2015 is the next challenge .    it would for example fit quite naturally in the context of the model developed by akbal et al .",
    "( 2015 ) to account for peculiar recovery after the 2007 glitch in .",
    "the authors suggested an extension of the standard vortex creep model ( alpar et al .",
    "1984 ) , the most plausible mechanism for vela type glitches . in this model",
    "a crustquake induces both vortex unpinning ( causing the glitch ) and the erratic , transient , radio pulse behavior .",
    "akbal et al ( 2015 ) estimated the size of an individual plate involved in crust breaking , d , in the 2007 glitch , to be about 6 m. if we assume that magnetic stresses were a dominant agent in breaking the crust and initiating the magnetar like bursts in the 2016 outburst , and that some n pieces of crust , each of volume d@xmath74 were involved in powering the series of 12 bursts observed , with total energy release e@xmath75 = 4.8@xmath4710@xmath66 ergs , n  d@xmath74 ( b@xmath76/8@xmath77)=e@xmath75 , we obtain the estimate b@xmath78=2.3@xmath4710@xmath76 ( d/6m)@xmath79 n@xmath80 , where b@xmath78 is the magnetic field strength in units of 10@xmath81 g. if we also assume that the 1.6 km radius inferred for the thermal emission covers a single surface layer of broken plates , then n@xmath82(1.6 km/6 m)@xmath76 , and b@xmath78@xmath820.86 is obtained .",
    "this means that the local surface magnetic field needed to power the bursts is larger than the inferred dipole magnetic field , but not much stronger than its strength at the pole .",
    "however , there is an uncertainty in the volume n d@xmath74 where the magnetic energy is released .",
    "if the thermal emission radius 1.6 km is larger than the area of the surface at which the crust breaking took place , because of the diffusion of the dissipated energy by thermal conduction or magneto - elastic waves , then n would be smaller and the estimated b@xmath78 could be larger .    in summary ,",
    "the observations of magnetar - like bursts from provide the following new insights .",
    "firstly they provide further evidence that global dipole fields above the quantum critical magnetic field strength are not essential for the magnetar burst trigger mechanism to operate .",
    "since bursting has not been observed from the majority of radio pulsars it seems clear that there is some minimum field required , however , and this might motivate a detailed x - ray survey of high field radio pulsars to establish the precise threshold for bursting activity .",
    "secondly , is the first source to demonstrate such a wide range of behavior associated with glitches and crustal heating : with variation in pulsed radio emission and now the occurrence of bursts .",
    "the superfluid , crust behavior , thermal and magnetospheric properties are an interconnected puzzle , and theoretical models must treat these elements together ."
