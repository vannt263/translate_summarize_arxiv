    "this offset can be explained by the baseline error , which is about @xmath47 or less at 690  ghz .",
    "furthermore , we used the phase calibrator with about @xmath28 away from the source .",

    "we therefore assume that the jcmt scuba value is more accurate . using the fit",

    "since this missing flux is larger than our flux error of @xmath60 , and the effect of the flux smearing due to phase or baseline errors is small , this missing flux is probably due to the existence of an extended component .",
    "if the missing flux of 3.4  jy is due to an extended component with a gaussian distribution that has a full width at half maximum of @xmath61 , its peak will be only twice of our r.m.s .",
    "we did not detect any significant signal with larger beam as mentioned above , but the r.m.s .",
    "noise level increased in the larger beam images due to a small number of data points at shorter baselines .",

    "molecular gas around the western nucleus in the moment 1 map , on the other hand , does not exhibit a clear velocity gradient as in the channel maps .",
    "this may be due to the nature of the moment 1 map ( i.e. , intensity weighted velocity field map ) with weak emission at the northwestern region .",
    "the kinematics on spatial scales larger than that immediately associated with the individual nucleus shows a velocity gradient along north - east to south - west direction with much shallower gradient than that of the eastern nucleus .",
    "all of these kinematics features mentioned above are also seen in the previously published lower - j @xmath2co lines @xcite .",

    "the flux ratio in our data is @xmath113 . if we assume that the missing flux of our data is due to the extended emission ( see sect .",
    "[ res - cont435 ] ) , the size of the extended emission is larger than the separation of the two nuclei . therefore the correction of the missing flux will increase both the fluxes of the two nuclei with almost the same amount , and the flux ratio increases toward unity , namely the ratio derived above is the lower limit .",
    "contamination of the flux from one nucleus to the other due to the large beam size is small ; this effect lowers the ratio by @xmath114 , which is smaller than the calibration errors .",
    "as frequency goes down to @xmath112  ghz , the flux ratio also goes down , and the flux of the eastern nucleus is about half or less of that of the western nucleus . since the data for the two lower frequencies may not have significant missing flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath2co seds for both nuclei and that of m82 or br 12020725 are similar , characterized with small intensity decreases up to j = 6 - 5 ( @xmath2co(6 - 5)/(2 - 1 ) ratio of about 0.5 ) .",
    "this suggests that the molecular gas in the two nuclei of arp 220 has the similar excitation conditions as that in m82 or br 12020725 , which have a density of @xmath212  @xmath187 or a temperature of @xmath213  k. * we could not find any evidence of an agn in arp 220 with the @xmath2co sed study .",
    "there is no clear difference in the @xmath2co seds between the agn hosting ulirg mrk 231 and the double nucleus of arp 220 ( and therefore m82 and br 12020725 ) .",
    "this suggests that the agn heating is not important for molecular gas excitation conditions in the large scale ( a few hundred to a few kpc scale ) .      *",
    "based on the large amount of missing flux in our data and other previously published evidence in molecular gas and dust , we suggest the existence of an extended component in the dust emission with its dust properties @xmath168  k , @xmath169 , and @xmath214 . a recent sma u / lirg survey suggests that many of u / lirgs seem to have extended components @xcite , so that having an extended dust component might be common . * the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) line spectrum shows stronger line intensity at the lower velocities than the higher velocities , but the spectra of the higher - j lines show the opposite , indicating that the higher velocity gas has higher density , higher temperature , or both , than the lower velocity component .",
    "* the intensities of the @xmath6co(2 - 1 ) and c@xmath7o(2 - 1 ) lines are similar .",
    "this suggests that the molecular gas in arp 220 is dense enough to be optically thick in both lines , or the abundance of either line deviates from the values in other nearby galaxies . to explain the ratio with the density effect , arp 220 should have molecular gas largely dominated by dense gas , more than in other nearby galaxies .",
    "underabundance of @xmath6co is possible , but it is less likely .",
    "overabundance of c@xmath7o is also possible , considering the @xmath2c and @xmath7o enrichment by high mass stars .",

    "<S> these observations resolve the eastern and western nuclei from each other , in both the molecular line and dust continuum emission . at 435  @xmath3 m , the peak intensity of the western nucleus is stronger than the eastern nucleus , and the difference in peak intensities is less than at longer wavelengths . fitting a simple model to </S>",
    "<S> the dust emission observed between 1.3  mm and 435  @xmath3 m suggests that dust emissivity power law index in the western nucleus is near unity and steeper in the eastern nucleus , about 2 , and that the dust emission is optically thick at the shorter wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with single dish measurements indicate that the interferometer observations are missing @xmath5 of the dust emission , most likely from a spatially extended component to which these observations are not sensitive . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2co j=6 - 5 line observations clearly resolve kinematically the two nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution and kinematics of the @xmath2co j=6 - 5 line appear to be very similar to lower j co lies observed at similar resolution . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of multiple @xmath2co line intensities indicates that the molecular gas in both nuclei have similar excitation conditions , although the western nucleus is warmer and denser . </S>",
