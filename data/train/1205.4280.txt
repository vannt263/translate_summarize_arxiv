    "rcw175 , located on the galactic plane at @xmath6  =  29.@xmath707 and @xmath8  =  @xmath90.@xmath768 , was originally identified and catalogued by  @xcite and was observed in emission with an h@xmath10 filter by  @xcite .",
    "rcw175 is actually just one component of the entire complex that will be discussed in this work .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:3_color_rcw175 ] , the complex consists of two separate components : g29.1 - 0.7 , a diffuse component to the east that is visible in h@xmath10  ( this is the component detected by  @xcite and  @xcite ) and g29.0 - 0.6 , a more compact component to the west that is heavily obscured by dust , and as a consequence , was not detectable in h@xmath10 emission . throughout this paper",
    "we will use rcw175 to refer to the entire complex .",
    "rcw175 is a particularly interesting hii region , as it has been observed to be a source of anomalous microwave emission  ( ame ;  @xcite ) .",
    "ame is observed as an excess of emission with respect to the other galactic emission mechanisms at cm wavelengths , namely : thermal bremsstrahlung or free - free emission produced as a result of the interaction between the free electrons and ions in the ionized gas ; synchrotron emission originating from the acceleration of relativistic electrons in the galactic magnetic fields ; and thermal dust emission arising from the vibration of large dust grains .",
    "ame is often attributed to electric dipole radiation arising from rapidly spinning small dust grains , each containing a dipole moment  @xcite , and has been observed in other galactic hii regions  @xcite along with a number of additional galactic environments such as molecular clouds  @xcite , dark clouds  @xcite and reflection nebulae  @xcite .    in this work",

    "we describe the morphology of the region and compute the kinematic distance , the sfr and the dust mass .",
    "we also produce a complete spectral energy distribution  ( sed ) of the source and discuss the presence of ame , including its possible origin and excitation mechanism within the specific environment of rcw175 . finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] we summarize our results and discuss our conclusions .",
    "performing a thorough investigation of rcw175 requires data spanning a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "however , given the angular size of rcw175 ( @xmath11  25  arcmin  ",
    "see figure  [ fig:3_color_rcw175 ] ) , we decided to only select data with an angular resolution @xmath12  15  arcmin to ensure the region was at least partially resolved .",

    "the reasons for neglecting the three shortest wavelength irac bands is that the point source density increases significantly with the decrease in wavelength , and at these shorter wavelengths the spectrum can be contaminated by the presence of ionic and molecular lines , therefore making it substantially more difficult to accurately investigate extended emission .",

    "both the 8 and 24  @xmath13 m data were corrected for the contribution of zodiacal light , which if not subtracted can result in an overestimate of the emission at these wavelengths by up to a factor of two .",
    "both data sets were then subjected to source extraction , as the removal of the sources allows us to better investigate the diffuse emission .",
    "the final step in the reprocessing was to perform an overlap correction to ensure a consistent background at each wavelength . given the data reprocessing , we assume a typical uncertainty of  10  @xmath15 for the extended emission in both the irac 8  @xmath13 m and the mips 24  @xmath13 m data .      to complement the mid - ir _ spitzer _ observations , data from the _ herschel space observatory _",

    "although g29.0 - 0.6 is the dominant component , both components are visible at all the radio frequencies , indicating the presence of ionized gas in both of them .    from figure  [ fig:3_color_rcw175 ]",
    "it is possible to see that the 24  @xmath13 m emission appears to originate within both the diffuse shell of g29.1 - 0.7 and the compact shell of g29.0 - 0.6 , while conversely the 8  @xmath13 m emission largely avoids these regions , with the bulk of the 8  @xmath13 m emission being concentrated around the edge of the shells in filamentary structures .",
    "this concept has previously been observed in other hii regions  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is generally explained in terms of the classical scenario of the formation of hii regions : the ionized gas , produced by the ionizing ob star , expands into the surrounding environment due to pressure gradients .",
    "this expansion sweeps up the gas and dust creating an interface between the ionized gas and the surrounding material where photons of lower energy dominate , known as a photodissociation region  ( pdr ; ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a complete review ) .",
    "in this hypothesis , the dust within the shell is warm , and thought to consist of small grains , while the smaller and less durable dust grains and large molecules , such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  ( pahs ) , may be destroyed by the harsh radiation field or swept up by the radiation pressure from the ionizing source .",
    "since this scenario is consistent with what we observe in rcw175 , we infer that rcw175 actually consists of two separate hii regions .",
    "in addition to the two - shell structure , also visible in figure  [ fig:3_color_rcw175 ] is the location of the b1  ii type star , s65 - 4 , which appears to be towards the very centre of g29.1 - 0.7 .",
    "s65 - 4 is part of a five star cluster identified by  @xcite , and is the only ob star in the  @xcite catalogue within the vicinity of rcw175 .",

    "the lack of any known ob stars associated with g29.0 - 0.6 does not suggest that there are none present , but instead can probably be explained by the fact that this more compact component is much more heavily obscured by dust    as can be seen by looking at the longer wavelength ir maps in figure  [ fig : data ] .",
    "having identified what we believe to be two individual hii regions within rcw175 , we use the available spectral data to determine the relationship between them . by looking at the @xmath22co and @xmath23co spectral data displayed in figures  [ fig:12co_data ] and  [ fig:13co_data ]",
    ", we determined that both g29.0 - 0.6 and g29.1 - 0.7 appear at a similar velocity of  @xmath11  50  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "in addition to both components appearing at the same velocity , they also appear to be spatially associated with each other , with the co emission in g29.1 - 0.7 restricted to the dust filament along the shell boundary and g29.0 - 0.6 being located at one end of this filament .",
    "this association implies that both components are at a similar distance and are actually interacting with each other .    in general",
    ", we find that the co emission appears to spatially replicate the _ herschel _ pacs and spire data , which is not entirely unexpected as both are tracing the denser environments within rcw175 .",
    "as has previously been mentioned , although the shell structure of g29.1 - 0.7 can be seen at 8  @xmath13 m , the longer wavelength pacs and spire emission is concentrated in a dust filament along the edge of the shell , but does not entirely enclose the shell . assuming the hii region formation hypothesis",
    ", this implies that the ism is much more dense in the direction of the filament , while in the other direction , the surrounding ism provided less resistance to the radiation pressure and hence the swept up material formed a much lower density shell .    from figure",
    "[ fig : rrl_data ] it is possible to identify an rrl component associated with rcw175 . however , due to the coarse angular resolution of data , it is difficult to determine exactly where the emission is originating from within rcw175 .",
    "the rrl data trace the ionized gas , therefore confirming its presence within the region .",
    "in fact ,  @xcite detected rrl emission from both g29.1 - 0.7 and g29.0 - 0.6 , confirming that ionized gas is present in both components of rcw175 , hence reinforcing the idea that both g29.1 - 0.7 and g29.0 - 0.6 are hii regions .    to further understand the morphology of rcw175 , we model the ir emission using a dust emission model .      in the past few years , there have been substantial improvements of dust models , which have significantly increased our understanding of the ism dust properties .",
    "one such model has been developed by  @xcite and is called dustem .",
    "dustem is a sophisticated model that allows the user to parameterize various physical dust quantities to compute the corresponding emission and extinction properties .",

    "we use dustem in a similar manner as was used in the previous works , modeling the dust in rcw175 in terms of five dust populations : small carbonaceous dust grains , large carbonaceous dust grains , large silicate dust grains and neutral and ionized pahs .",
    "we merge the neutral and ionized pahs into a single component of pahs , use the small carbonaceous dust grains as the very small grain  ( vsg ) dust component and combine the large carbonaceous and silicate dust grains to form a big grain  ( bg ) dust component .",
    "since dustem itself does not contain a fitting routine , we used an updated version of the sed - fitting routine developed for the analysis performed on the perseus molecular cloud by  @xcite .",
    "this fitting routine is based on the idl routine mpfit  @xcite and combines the dust emissivities computed by  dustem with the instrumental bandpass filters , deriving an estimate of the flux that would be effectively observed at a given wavelength .    for this analysis",

    ", combining dustem with these seven ir bands allows us to characterize the three dust grain populations of interest : pahs , vsgs and bgs . to do this , all seven ir maps were convolved to the common angular resolution of the spire 500  @xmath13 m map  ( 35  arcsec ) and regridded onto a unified grid of 11.5  arcsec pixels . running dustem with our sed - fitting routine on a pixel - by - pixel basis",
    ", we fit the seven ir data points by adjusting the abundance of the pahs and vsgs relative to the bgs  ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , the strength of the exciting radiation field  ( erf ;  @xmath26 ) , and the column density of hydrogen  ( @xmath27 ) . in the previous work on the perseus molecular cloud ,",
    "@xcite parameterized the radiation field by simply scaling the  @xcite solar neighborhood radiation field , which is realistic given the lack of high - mass star formation in the cloud .",
    "however , since there is clearly a source of ionization present in rcw175 , scaling the standard  @xcite solar neighborhood field alone would not be a good approximation .",
    "therefore , we decided to parameterize the erf by combining the  @xcite radiation field with a 40,000  k blackbody , which is the typical temperature of an ob star , representing the source of ionization . to combine these two separate components of the erf , we normalized the 40,000  k blackbody to the  @xcite radiation field between 6 and 13.6  ev  ( see figure  [ fig : isrf ] ) .",

    "regarding our parameterization of the erf , from figure  [ fig : isrf ] it is apparent that the dust extinction only affects the shorter wavelengths and that for values of @xmath26  @xmath31  2500 , the blackbody becomes totally dominant .",

    "these temperature distributions are computed taking into account the multi - photon absorption processes , based on the method described by  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to complement the parameter maps , we computed the median temperature of the bg size distribution , and used it as an estimate of the equilibrium temperature of the dust  ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we emphasize that it is unphysical to compute a median temperature for the other dust components as these are stochastically heated and hence are not in thermal equilibrium with the erf .",

    "the maps also show that the vsgs are concentrated in the interior of both g29.1 - 0.7 and g29.0 - 0.6 , while the pahs are constrained to the edge of both components .",
    "there is also a clear deficit of pahs within g29.1 - 0.7 .",

    "the erf appears to be offset from the centre of the shell and concentrated toward the dust filament along the edge of the shell .",
    "the column density map reveals that the highest densities  ( @xmath11  1.5  @xmath1  10@xmath35  h  @xmath36 ) are also found in the vicinity of g29.0 - 0.6 , implying that there are large quantities of dust present which we believe is the reason for a lack of observed ob stars associated with this component .",
    "also observable is that the density is decreased toward the centre of the diffuse shell of g29.1 - 0.7 with values of  @xmath11  5  @xmath1  10@xmath37  h  @xmath36 .",
    "the dust temperature map closely resembles the erf map , which is expected given the relationship between these two physical quantities , and shows that the dust temperature in rcw175 is in the range of 20",
    "  30  k , which is typical for hii regions .",
    "this map also illustrates that the highest temperatures are found towards g29.0 - 0.6 .",
    "having already identified that these two hii regions are associated with each other , and based on the fact that g29.0 - 0.6 is more compact , has a stronger erf , a higher dust temperature , and a higher column density , we believe that g29.0 - 0.6 is younger than the more evolved g29.1 - 0.7 , and hypothesize that it may even have formed as a result of the expansion of g29.1 - 0.7 into the surrounding ism . such triggered star formation is ubiquitous throughout the galaxy  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) essentially because the gravitational timescale of molecular gas is shorter than the typical lifetime of an o - type star .",
    "@xcite identified three distinct triggering mechanisms : i ) direct compression of pre - existing density enhancements in a cloud ; ii ) accumulation of gas into a dense filament that collapses gravitationally into dense cores  ( `` collect and collapse '' ) ; and iii ) cloud collisions .",
    "given the environment of rcw175 and the significant differences in size , and hence age , it is unlikely that this was produced as the result of cloud collisions .",
    "assuming that g29.1 - 0.7 formed first , then the expansion into the surrounding ism could have triggered the formation of g29.0 - 0.6 by either causing an existing density enhancement to collapse or by the collect and collapse method .",
    "it is difficult to determine which method is more favorable , however , given that g29.0 - 0.6 is located at the edge of the shell of g29.1 - 0.7 , it is likely that triggering has occured .",

    "additionally , a search in the  @xcite catalogue of galactic supernova remnants reveals three nearby  ( @xmath17 1  degree away ) supernova remnants ,  g29.7 - 0.3  ( kes 75 ) and g28.6 - 0.1 both  @xmath11  0.7  degrees away and g29.6 + 0.1  @xmath11  0.9  degrees away , which may be causing synchrotron relativistic electrons to escape into the surrounding environments .",
    "we therefore conclude that the low frequency emission in rcw  175 is arising from the free - free emission from the ionized gas and some small contribution from background residual synchrotron emission .      to represent the thermal dust emission we used a modified blackbody curve , fitting for both the dust temperature , @xmath34 , and the dust emissivity spectral index , @xmath77 .",
    "two curves were used to fit both the cold and warm dust components .",
    "this is necessary since we are computing the sed for the entire region , and we know that the dust within the entire region is not emitting at a single temperature . in the dustem analysis , since we were fitting the sed on a pixel - by - pixel basis , we did not have this problem , and hence were able to restrict ourselves to using a single dust temperature .",
    "the best fitting values for the cold dust are @xmath78  =  2.0  @xmath0  0.1 and @xmath79  =  22.9  @xmath0  5.8  k , while for the warm dust we find best fitting values of @xmath80  =  2.0  @xmath0  0.1 and @xmath81  =  52.7  @xmath0  20.5  k. these values of the cold and warm dust components are consistent with previous estimates of dust temperatures in hii regions  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is also noticeable that by including the _ herschel _ data in our sed , the temperatures computed in this analysis are more accurate than the dust temperature estimated by  @xcite who fitted a modified blackbody curve to the iris 100 and 60  @xmath13 m data , and obtained a temperature of 30.1  @xmath0  5.7  k.      the excess of emission observed between  @xmath11  10    60  ghz in the sed of rcw175 is a clear indication of the presence of ame .",
    "the peaked nature of the ame spectrum is consistent with the current theoretical models of spinning dust  @xcite , and therefore we modeled the ame as a spinning dust component . to do this we used the spinning dust code , spdust  @xcite . for a given set of input parameters , spdust computes the emissivity of the spinning dust emission normalized by the hydrogen column density .",
    "we used the updated version of  spdust , which not only accounts for dust grains spinning about their axis of greatest inertia , it also accounts for grains spinning about their non principal axes .",
    "since we have only two data points covering the critical frequency range , we decided not to fit for the individual spinning dust parameters within spdust .",
    "instead , we adopted the idealized physical parameters for the various phases of the ism defined by  @xcite  ( warm ionized medium , warm neutral medium , cold neutral medium , molecular cloud , dark cloud , reflection nebula and pdr ) within spdust and fitted for the column density .",
    "this simply involves scaling the amplitude of the spinning dust curve and has no effect on its shape or peak frequency .",
    "we performed the fit using the parameters for each of the idealized environments and found that the warm ionized medium model resulted in the best fit to the data .",
    "the spinning dust curve for the warm ionized medium fits the data extremely well , and from the fit we found that the column density required to produce the observed spinning dust emission is  @xmath82  =  ( 3.8  @xmath0  0.5 )  @xmath1  10@xmath37  h  @xmath36 , which is consistent with the range of values of the total column density obtained from the dustem analysis  ( section  [ subsec : dust_modeling ] ) .",
    "another method of confirming the strength of the ame is to compare to ame observed in other environments . to do this",
    ", the  @xmath11  30  ghz flux density is generally normalized by the 100  @xmath13 m flux density .",
    "this quantity , often called the dust emissivity , was computed for rcw175 and we found a value of ( 5.8  @xmath0  1.1 )  @xmath1  10@xmath83 , which is consistent with the value computed by  @xcite for the diffuse dust at intermediate latitudes .",
    "these two results imply that the parameters we obtain for the ame in rcw175 are both physical and meaningful .    to investigate the origin of the ame component observed in figure  [ fig : full_sed ] we adopt the cbi 31  ghz map as a tracer of the ame .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption given that the free - free and thermal dust components alone only predict a 31  ghz flux density of 1.7  jy compared to the measured value of 6.0  @xmath0  0.3  jy .",
    "this is an excess of 4.3  jy implying that  @xmath14  70  @xmath15 of the cbi emission is due to ame  ( 14.3@xmath84 ) .",
    "we note that this is a larger fraction of ame than was found by  @xcite as they fixed the spectral index of the low frequency emission at a value of @xmath90.12 .",
    "however , even if we fit a power - law component with a fixed spectral index of  @xmath90.12 , we find that the fraction of ame is still  @xmath14  60  @xmath15  ( 12.7@xmath84 ) .    since we know that there is the possibility of ongoing star formation in rcw175 , we investigated the correlation between the ame and the location of the yso candidates identified in section  [ subsec : ysos ] .",
    "massive ysos form in ultra - compact hii  ( uchii ) regions , which have densities  @xmath31  10@xmath85 h  @xmath86 and hence are optically thick . therefore ,",
    "the free - free emission originating from the ionized gas is self - absorbed , which results in a turnover in the spectrum from  @xmath10  =  @xmath90.12 to  @xmath10  @xmath14  2 .",
    "the exact frequency of this turnover depends on the density of the uchii region , but can occur up to tens of ghz . of the 6 yso candidates identified within the vicinity of rcw175 , only one  ( source 40 ) was located in g29.0 - 0.6 and this is situated  @xmath14  1  arcmin from the peak of the ame .",
    "the pointing accuracy of the cbi is  @xmath14  0.5 arcmin  @xcite , hence making it unlikely that the source of the excess emission in g29.0 - 0.6 is due to an uchii region .",
    "similarly , none of the 6 yso candidates are associated with the peak of the ame in g29.1 - 0.7 , again suggesting that the ame in this region is not due to an uchii region .",
    "having ruled out the possibility of the ame in rcw175 being due to self - absorbed free - free emission , we next want to investigate the connection between the ame and the dust properties . therefore , we compare the cbi 31  ghz map with the dust parameter maps discussed in section  [ subsec : dust_modeling ] to identify which parameters , if any , correlate well with the ame . in figure",
    "[ fig : param_maps_contours ] we display the dust parameter maps with the contours of the 31  ghz emission overlaid .",
    "it is apparent that the 31  ghz emission is not strongly spatially correlated with the pah abundance .",
    "the deficit of pahs within the shell of g29.1 - 0.7 is coincident with the ame observed in this component , while there appears to be a small collection of pahs present towards the ame originating from g29.0 - 0.6 .",
    "looking at the vsg abundances relative to the 31  ghz emission we find that the vsgs are located in the interior of both g29.0 - 0.6 and g29.1 - 0.7 .",
    "we find that only the vsgs in g29.0 - 0.6 are correlated with the 31ghz emission .",
    "the vsgs present in g29.1 - 0.7 are centred on the location of the b1 ii star at the centre of the shell , which is clearly offset from the ame emission .",
    "this suggests that the ame is not being produced by the vsgs , and is not directly associated with the source of ionization .",
    "although the hydrogen column density is increased towards g29.0 - 0.6 , and decreased towards g29.1 - 0.7 , there is no apparent correlation with the ame .",
    "however , the maps of the erf strength and @xmath34 appear to be very well correlated with the cbi emission . not only is the correlation present towards g29.0 - 0.6 , but it is also present towards g29.1 - 0.7 . as stated previously , within g29.1 - 0.7 , the erf is enhanced towards the dust filament along the edge of the shell , implying that the ionization front is not uniform in all directions . the correlation between the ame and the erf and the warmer dust implies that the ame is dependent on the strength of the erf , and suggests that it is the excitation of the erf that is producing the ame .",
    "this result is consistent with the result found in the perseus molecular cloud , where the strength of the erf appeared to be enhanced in regions of ame  @xcite , which therefore could be the result of electric dipole emission from spinning dust grains being spun up by photon  grain interactions .",
    "such photon  grain interactions may also cause the grains to become dehydrogenated and as discussed by  @xcite , this will have a strong effect on the electric dipole moment of the grain , which will also affect the spinning dust emissivity . the observed correlation between the ame and the erf in both rcw175 and the perseus molecular cloud is in agreement with the spinning dust theory , where , if all other parameters are fixed , the spinning dust emissivity increases with increasing erf strength  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that it is possible that a fraction of the excess emission could be due to magnetic dipole emission produced by thermal fluctuations in the magnetism of the grains  @xcite . according to the theory",
    ", the magnitude of the magnetic fluctuations depends on the magnetic properties of the grain material , and any strongly magnetic grain material will almost certainly contain fe .",
    "indeed , recent results from  @xcite have shown that in hii regions , at least  @xmath11  40  @xmath15 of the fe atoms are embedded in dust grains , with this fraction increasing to  @xmath11  97  @xmath15 in high metallicity , high density hii regions .",
    "it is difficult to quantify the exact contribution originating from magnetic dipole emission , but one possible method to help distinguish between the two emission mechanisms would be to observe the polarization of the ame . electric dipole emission is predicted to be only slightly polarized  ( a fractional polarization of <  1  @xmath15 above 30  ghz ;  @xcite ) , while magnetic dipole emission from single domain magnetic grains is expected to be highly polarized  ( a fractional polarization of up to  @xmath11  40  @xmath15 ;  @xcite ) .",
    "no such observations of rcw175 have yet been performed , however , recent observations by  @xcite have shown that the magnetic field strength towards galactic hii regions is similar to the typical magnetic field strength of the diffuse ism , implying that there is very little polarized emission in these environments .",
    "this leads us to believe that the contribution of magnetic dipole emission from single domain magnetic grains in rcw175 is minimal .",
    "however , we note that magnetic dipole emission arising from grains containing magnetic inclusions is expected to be relatively unpolarized  ( a fractional polarization of <  1  @xmath15 ;  @xcite ) , and as such , we can not completely rule out a contribution from magnetic dipole emission .",
    "it is interesting that the ame in g29.1 - 0.7 is not spatially correlated with the surrounding pdr , where the pahs are concentrated , but is actually originating from a region just on the interior of the pdr . as we have shown in figure  [ fig : param_maps_contours ] , this region has an enhanced erf compared to the rest of g29.1 - 0.7 .",
    "recent work by  @xcite have shown that in the orion bar pdr , there is a clear stratification present regarding the major gas ions .",
    "they find that although the [ cii ] line at 158  @xmath13 m traces the dust in the pdr quite well , the [ nii ] line at 122  @xmath13 m is not spatially correlated with the dust , but actually originates closer to the ionizing source .",
    "this is interesting as we appear to be finding a similar result with the ame in g29.1 - 0.7 not originating from the pdr , but rather originating closer to the ionization source .",
    "in fact ,  @xcite investigated the effect of impulsive excitation due to individual ion ",
    "grain collisions , and found that these impulses result in a broadening of the spinning dust spectrum to higher frequencies and an increase in the spinning dust emissivity .",
    "furthermore , a recent analysis by  @xcite has shown that the spinning dust model is sensitive to the abundance of the major gas ions , with both the peak frequency and the spinning dust emissivity increasing with ion abundance .",
    "this may be what we are observing here , explaining why the ame is not coincident with the pdr but is originating from a region closer to the source of ionization due to the stratification of the gas ions in the pdr .",
    "further information regarding the distribution of the major gas ions within rcw175 is required to test this hypothesis but , to date , no such observations exist .",
    "in this work we have performed a detailed analysis of the environment of rcw175 . for this purpose",
    ", we used photometric data from 21  cm  ( 1.4  ghz ) to the 8  @xmath13 m  ( 3.75  thz ) in conjunction with hi , co and rrl spectral data . by looking at the photometric data , we found that rcw175 is not a single hii region , but consists , in fact , of two separate hii regions , g29.1 - 0.7 and g29.0 - 0.6 .",
    "g29.1 - 0.7 is larger , more evolved , and most likely the older of the two regions ; while g29.0 - 0.6 is more compact , more dusty , and likely younger .",
    "g29.1 - 0.7 contains the ionizing b1  ii star , s65 - 4 , at its centre , while g29.0 - 0.6 is characterized by the presence of filamentary pillars .",
    "both components are clearly associated with each other , given the small spread in velocities , and we suggest that g29.0 - 0.6 may have been produced as a consequence of triggering from the expansion of g29.1 - 0.7 into the surrounding ism .    using the dust model dustem",
    ", we characterized the dust properties within the region and we found that there is a significant depletion of pahs within the larger , diffuse shell of g29.1 - 0.7 , and to a lesser extent within g29.0 - 0.6 .",
    "we also found that the abundance of the vsgs is increased towards the interior of both g29.1 - 0.7 and g29.0 - 0.6 .",
    "both these results are consistent with current theories on the formation of hii regions , with the pahs concentrated in the surrounding pdrs , while the warmer dust originates from within the centre of the shell .",
    "recent work has hinted that the 24  @xmath13 m emission originating from within the hii region might not be due to vsgs , but to a population of very warm bgs , emitting thermally at 24  @xmath13 m  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "looking at the available spectral data we hypothesized that the ionized gas has become dissociated from the molecular gas , and we computed a distance of 3.2  @xmath0  0.2  kpc to rcw175 and a corresponding galactocentric distance of 5.4  @xmath0  0.3  kpc .",
    "we used the 24  @xmath13 m emission to compute an estimate of the sfr for the region of ( 12.6  @xmath0 1.9 )  @xmath1  10@xmath2  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 , and also identified 6 yso candidates in its vicinity .",
    "additionally , we calculated that the total mass of dust in rcw175 is  215  @xmath0  53  m@xmath3 .",
    "finally , we produced a complete sed from the radio to the mid - ir for the entire complex , and found a clear excess of emission at cm wavelengths .",
    "this excess was well fitted with a spinning dust model using typical parameters for the warm ionized medium . by comparing the ame with the parameter maps produced by the dust modeling analysis",
    ", we found that the ame is not spatially correlated with either the abundance of the pahs or vsgs , but is much more correlated with the strength of the erf and hence the dust temperature .",
    "this is similar to the result observed for the ame in the perseus molecular cloud by  @xcite , and hence we suggest that the erf is playing an important role in causing the dust grains to spin .",
    "further investigation of the ame with respect to the location of the yso candidates rules out the possibility of the ame originating from an uchii region , and based on the fact that the ame in g29.1 - 0.7 originates from the interior of the pdr , we hypothesize that the ame is due to spinning dust , but that there is a significant contribution to the spinning dust model from the major gas ions .    further studies like the current one need to be performed in order to fully understand if this connection between the ame and the erf is found throughout the galaxy or only occurs in certain environments , and further modeling will help us understand the role of the gas ions in the spinning dust models .",

    "<S> we find that the ame previously detected in rcw175 is not correlated with the smallest dust grains ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or small carbonaceous dust grains ) , but rather with the exciting radiation field within the region . </S>",
    "<S> this is a similar result to that found in the perseus molecular cloud , another region which harbors ame , suggesting that the radiation field may play a pivotal role in the production of this new galactic emission mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we suggest that these observations may hint at the importance of understanding the role played by the major gas ions in spinning dust models . </S>"
