    "the discovery of x - ray emission from clusters of galaxies revealed that clusters are filled with ionized gas .",
    "not long after this discovery , @xcite pointed out that the electrons in this gas should also scatter photons from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and that the thermal motion of the electrons would produce a detectable shift in the cmb spectrum .",
    "this shift is known as the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect .",
    "together , sz effect and x - ray observations of the intracluster gas determine the physical size of the cluster along the line of sight .",
    "comparing this scale with the apparent angular size of the cluster yields a direct measurement of the angular diameter distance , assuming the cluster is spherical @xcite .",
    "this geometric estimate is independent of the usual distance ladder . using cluster distance and redshift measurements for low redshift clusters , the hubble constant , @xmath0 ,",
    "can be determined .",
    "measurements of the redshift - distance relation at redshifts up to @xmath1 would constrain the matter density , @xmath2 , and and the cosmological constant , @xmath3 , in units of the critical density @xcite .    we know from x - ray images that clusters are often not round in projection , and therefore can not be spherical ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a number of authors have investigated the effect of asphericity on the inferred value of @xmath0 , either with simulations @xcite or analytic ellipsoidal models of the gas @xcite . for an individual cluster ,",
    "the estimated distance will differ from the actual distance by a factor of the ratio , @xmath4 , of the size of the cluster along the line of sight to its size in the plane of the sky .",
    "the usual solution to this problem has been to suggest averaging the inferred values of the hubble constant over a sample of clusters . here , we propose a different approach",
    ". we will demonstrate that it is possible to infer the three - dimensional shape of an individual cluster , and recover the true distance .    in its simplest form ,",
    "the idea behind the distance determination is as follows .",
    "the sz effect is caused by thompson scattering of cmb photons by electrons .",
    "it is therefore proportional to the column density , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the electron number density and @xmath9 is a measure of the path length of a given line of sight through the cluster .",
    "the x - ray emission is due to bremsstrahlung from electron - ion collisions , so the x - ray surface brightness , @xmath10 , is proportional to @xmath11 . squaring @xmath12 and dividing by @xmath11 from the x - ray observations , we can eliminate the electron density to find the path length . finally , by comparing this path length with the angular extent of the cluster",
    ", we can infer the angular diameter distance , @xmath13 , to the cluster . for clusters at redshift @xmath14",
    ", we can calculate the hubble constant , @xmath15 .",
    "we have neglected the fact that both the sz effect and the x - ray emissivity depend on the temperature of the electrons as well as their density .",
    "we describe the method in more detail , taking temperature into account , in ",
    "[ degeneracy ] . however , this simplified picture suffices to illustrate the effect of cluster shapes on the inferred distance .",
    "the method assumes that the cluster is spherical , so that the path length along the line of sight and the width of the cluster perpendicular to the line of sight are the same .",
    "if the actual gas distribution is not spherical , this assumption can introduce a systematic error in the inferred distance .",
    "if the gas distribution is elongated by a factor of @xmath4 along the line of sight , this will increase the measured sz effect and x - ray surface brightness by @xmath4 , without changing the apparent angular size of the cluster . as a result",
    ", the inferred distance will be increased by a factor of @xmath4 relative to the true distance , and @xmath16 will be underestimated by @xmath4 .",
    "it has generally been assumed that averaging the inferred values of the hubble constant over different cluster orientations at random would eliminate any systematic bias .",
    "in fact , the validity of this assumption seems to depend on both the intrinsic shapes of clusters ( whether prolate , oblate or triaxial ) and on the choice of projected axis used to establish the angular scale @xcite , though the remaining systematic errors are relatively small ( @xmath17  @xmath18 ) if the semi - major projected axis is used .",
    "in addition , removing the systematic effect of elongation requires averaging over an unbiased sample of clusters .",
    "if clusters are chosen based on x - ray surface brightness or sz effect amplitude ( or eliminated based on non - detections ) , clusters elongated along the line of sight will be favored @xcite .",
    "clusters elongated due to recent mergers may be favored because of their higher x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite have suggested selecting clusters without evidence of recent mergers , but even this may introduce its own bias if the merger signatures used are not independent of orientation .    finally , even with an unbiased sample , asphericity contributes roughly @xmath19 to the rms scatter in the value of @xmath0 from individual clusters @xcite . thus measurements are required for a large ( @xmath20 ) cluster sample .",
    "this may limit more detailed studies of the redshift - distance relation to estimate @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "some evidence @xcite suggests that a large part of the scatter in measurements of @xmath0 from x - ray and sz effect observations is due to variations in cluster shapes .    if we had a method of determining the three - dimensional shape of individual clusters , we could correct for the effect of elongation on the distance",
    "this would enable us to reduce the scatter in the inferred redshift - distance relation .",
    "in addition to reducing the number of clusters needed to achieve a given level of precision , this might also allow us to study other effects ( to quantify any variations in the clumpiness of the intracluster gas from one cluster to another , for instance ) .",
    "the degeneracy between the distance , @xmath13 , and the elongation factor , @xmath4 , is intrinsic to observations of projected cluster properties .",
    "therefore , to measure elongation without prior knowledge of @xmath13 , we need an additional theoretical constraint .",
    "an obvious choice is hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this assumption in turn introduces a new unknown , the cluster mass distribution . to compensate",
    ", we must add an additional observational constraint , the projected mass distribution as measured by gravitational lensing",
    ". we will prove that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , together with lensing observations , is sufficient to break the degeneracy and allow us to recover both the elongation and the distance .",
    "such an approach has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "has also discussed a method for reconstruction of the three - dimensional structure of clusters .",
    "the perturbative approach of @xcite may also be useful in inferring asphericity .",
    "has suggested a somewhat different way of breaking the same degeneracy .",
    "while it also combines x - ray , sz effect , and lensing observations , it is based on the assumption of a universal ( and measurable ) baryon fraction for clusters , rather than on that of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we will demonstrate that our method can successfully recover the shape and distance with high accuracy when applied to simple analytical models of clusters .",
    "we first test the method on clusters which are axisymmetric about line of sight , and then on triaxial clusters of arbitrary orientation . in the future , we will test its ability to do the same when applied to simulated clusters , which more closely resemble real ones , at least in their complexity and asymmetry .",
    "we should note that one advantage of the traditional method of inferring @xmath0 from sz effect and x - ray observations is that it does not depend on hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium in real clusters may introduce a systematic error in the value of @xmath0 inferred from any method which does rely on this assumption .",
    "it is essential to apply our method to simulated clusters to attempt to quantify any such systematic error .    in  [ degeneracy ]",
    ", we will explain the elongation - distance degeneracy in more detail . by using ellipsoidal potentials",
    ", we will prove analytically that the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption and weak lensing observations are sufficient in principle to break the degeneracy in the case of a cluster axisymmetric about the line of sight . in practice , the actual model we use to infer the elongation from artificial observations uses ellipsoidal mass distributions .",
    "we will formulate this method in  [ de - projection ] for clusters with arbitrary triaxial shapes .    in  [ test_cases ] , we will introduce the simple analytic clusters we use to test the de - projection method . we will describe how we contruct artificial observations of these clusters , and specify our assumptions about the uncertainties in these observations in  [ artificial ] .",
    "some additional numerical details of the calculation are described in ",
    "[ numerical ] .",
    "we apply our de - projection method to these clusters and present our results in  [ results ] .",
    "we discuss the uncertainties in the inferred distance , both statistical and systematic in  [ discussion ] . finally , in  [ conclusions",
    "] , we will summarize our conclusions and highlight directions for future work .",
    "degeneracy      to understand how the distance can be determined from x - ray and sz effect measurements , consider the observables .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect is due to the compton scattering of microwave background photons by the electrons in the intracluster plasma , with a probability per unit path length , @xmath21 , equal to the thomson cross - section , @xmath22 , times the electron density , @xmath8 .",
    "the photon frequency , @xmath23 , follows a random walk with @xmath24 per scattering equal to the line of sight velocity dispersion @xmath25 of the electrons , divided by @xmath26 .",
    "the variance @xmath24 integrated along the path through the cluster is given by the compton @xmath27-parameter , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "observationally , what is measured is not the frequency shift of individual photons , but the change in the black body spectrum of the cmb .",
    "this is commonly expressed in terms of the shift in the brightness temperature at a given frequency , @xmath30 , which is proportional to @xmath27 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( plus relativistic corrections ) when @xmath33 .",
    "when we refer to the sz effect , we mean , technically , the thermal sz effect due to the isotropic , thermal motions of the electrons . if the cluster has a nonzero peculiar velocity with respect to the hubble flow , this will cause a systematic frequency shift known as the kinetic sz effect .",
    "the x - ray emissivity is due to bremsstrahlung from electron - ion collisions , so it is proportional to the square of the electron density .",
    "modern x - ray telescopes , such as the chandra x - ray observatory ( chandra ) and xmm - newton , can measure the x - ray surface brightness as a function of photon energy , with spectral resolving power @xmath34 ",
    "@xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "thus , they can measure the x - ray surface brightness per unit energy interval , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the redshift of the cluster , @xmath39 is the photon energy in the observer s frame , @xmath40 is the rest frame photon energy , and @xmath41 is the x - ray spectral emissivity .    both the x - ray surface brightness and the temperature decrement can be mapped as a function of angular position , @xmath42 , on the sky . if the electron density and temperature are spherically symmetric , then these spatially resolved observations can be de - projected .",
    "because the observations are functions of angular position , @xmath43 , the de - projection determines @xmath44 and @xmath45 as functions of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the radius and @xmath13 is the angular diameter distance to the cluster . given x - ray observations with sufficient spatial and energy resolution , the temperature profile , @xmath48 , can be inferred .",
    "this allows us to eliminate the temperature - dependent factors , to obtain @xmath49 from @xmath50 and @xmath51 from @xmath10 .",
    "the ratio of the square of the sz effect measurement to the x - ray measurement gives the angular diameter distance .",
    "now , suppose that contours of constant @xmath8 and @xmath52 are not spherical , but are instead elongated by a factor of @xmath4 along the line of sight .",
    "then , the integration path length and thus the normalization of the projected observables will be increased by a constant factor of @xmath4 .",
    "the shapes of the measured profiles , @xmath53 and @xmath54 will be unchanged , so there will be no obvious sign that the cluster is not spherical . if the data are analyzed under the assumption of spherical symmetry , the inferred distance will be @xmath55 , since the square of the temperature decrement is being compared to the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "any method which relies on the normalization of quantities integrated along line of sight suffers from this degeneracy ; only the product of the distance and the elongation can be determined .",
    "observations of additional projected quantities do not help .",
    "the only way to break the degeneracy is to postulate an additional constraint among the cluster properties .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium condition , @xmath56 provides such a constraint between the pressure , @xmath57 , the gas density , @xmath58 , and the gravitational potential , @xmath59 .    of course ,",
    "while hydrostatic equilibrium adds a constraint , it also introduces a new unknown , the gravitational potential , @xmath59 , of the cluster .",
    "fortunately , this extra degree of freedom can in turn be constrained by weak gravitational lensing observations , as we will see in  [ weak_lensing ] .",
    "then , in  [ breaking ] , we will show how adding weak lensing data and the hydrostatic equilibrium condition allows us to break the degeneracy .",
    "the gravitational potential of a cluster deflects light rays from sources behind the cluster .",
    "the lensing effect is determined by the convergence , @xmath60 , which is the ratio of the projected surface density , @xmath61 , of the lens at angular position @xmath42 , to the critical surface density ,    @xmath62    where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are angular diameter distances to the source , to the lens , and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "since each of the angular diameter distances is proportional to @xmath66 , @xmath67 is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "however , the product @xmath68 which we will encounter depends only on the source and lens redshifts , and on the cosmological parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc . ) which determine the shape of the redshift - distance relation , but is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the convergence is also equal to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is called the lens potential @xcite .",
    "the deflection of light rays distorts the images of background galaxies , magnifying them in both area and flux , and changing their shapes . in the weak lensing limit , where the second partial derivatives @xmath71 , these effects must be measured statistically by averaging over many background galaxies . in this limit",
    ", the images are magnified by @xmath72 , while the distortion in their shapes is characterized by the 2-component shear , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75    direct measurements of the magnification in the weak lensing limit are difficult , though several techniques have been suggested @xcite and at least one cluster has been detected and mapped by such techniques @xcite .",
    "more frequently , the shear is measured from the galaxies shapes . demonstrated a method for reconstructing @xmath60 , up to a constant offset , from maps of the shear ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the ambiguity of this offset is known as the mass sheet degeneracy .",
    "we should note that equation  ( [ critical_density ] ) assumes a single , known source redshift , @xmath76 . in the weak lensing limit ,",
    "@xmath77 can simply be replaced with its average over the redshifts of the sources @xcite .",
    "still , it is necessary to estimate the source redshift distribution . for @xmath78 , this task",
    "is simplified by the fact that the ratio @xmath79 becomes independent of the source redshift . more generally ,",
    "several methods have been suggested for estimating the source redshift distribution from the lensing data itself @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ hydrostatic ] ) implies that the contours of constant pressure coincide with the cluster isopotentials .",
    "taking the curl of both sides , we see that @xmath80 , so the isopotentials are also contours of constant gas density . finally , since @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the mean mass per particle , they are contours of constant temperature as well . thus , for a potential with a single minimum , both @xmath58 and @xmath83 are functions of @xmath59 .",
    "then , the balance between pressure and gravity perpendicular to the isopotentials can be rewritten as @xmath84 or @xmath85    since the observations are made as a function of angular position , @xmath42 , it is convenient to define a coordinate @xmath86 . then , we can define a three - dimensional position @xmath87 in radians .",
    "we also define the ellipsoidal equivalent , @xmath88 , of a radius , by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a symmetric , positive - definite matrix .",
    "surfaces of constant @xmath88 form a family of similar , concentric , coaxial ellipsoids . in the case of a cluster with isopotentials elongated along the line of sight by @xmath4 , @xmath91",
    "the gas properties are functions of @xmath59 and thus of @xmath88 .",
    "if we apply a spherical de - projection to such an elongated cluster , we will obtain @xmath92 and @xmath93 as functions of @xmath88 .",
    "again , we can extract the temperature profile , @xmath94 , which depends only on the ratio between the x - ray surface brightness in different bands , and is therefore independent of @xmath4 .",
    "rewriting equation  ( [ dimensionless_pressure_balance ] ) in terms of derivatives with respect to @xmath88 , we see that @xmath95 both terms on the left - hand side of this equation can be inferred from the x - ray observations , independent of @xmath13 and @xmath4 , so we can integrate to find @xmath96 independent of @xmath13 or @xmath4 .",
    "equation  ( [ lens_potential ] ) relates @xmath59 to @xmath97 , so we can predict @xmath98 as a function of @xmath42 . as we noted in  [ weak_lensing ]",
    ", @xmath99 depends upon the source and lens redshifts and on cosmology , but is independent of @xmath64 and @xmath0 , so we can predict @xmath100 . taking the appropriate partial derivatives with respect to @xmath101 , we can calculate both @xmath102 and @xmath103 . comparing with @xmath60 or @xmath104 from lensing observations",
    ", we can solve for the elongation , @xmath4 .",
    "either @xmath60 or @xmath104 is sufficient to fix @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , in principle , @xmath4 can be determined from weak shear measurements alone , without the need to infer @xmath60 or to resolve the mass sheet degeneracy .",
    "thus , given the x - ray and weak lensing observations , the hydrostatic equilibrium condition , the cosmology and the distribution of source redshifts , we can infer the elongation , @xmath4 .",
    "this breaks the degeneracy . recalling that the x - ray and sz effect observations determine @xmath105",
    ", we see that we can infer @xmath13 and thus @xmath0 .",
    "finding the three - dimensional cluster properties from the two - dimensional observations is an inverse problem . following the usual approach",
    ", we construct a set of parameterized three - dimensional cluster models . the angular diameter distance to the cluster",
    "is included as one of the parameters .",
    "for any given set of parameter values , we can predict the observations from the model . we define a @xmath106 function quantifying the differences between the actual observations and these predictions , and",
    "minimize it to find the best fit parameters .",
    "as always , the trick is to choose the set of models well .",
    "if the set is not general enough , we will get deceptively tight constraints on the distance , based as much on the restricted choice of models as on the data .",
    "any systematic differences between the best - fitting model and the data may also translate into systematic errors in our estimation of the distance and elongation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the set is too general , it will be impossible to constrain the parameters .    to begin",
    ", we will discuss the appropriate symmetry assumptions for elongated clusters in  [ symmetry ] .",
    "we will argue that an ellipsoidal mass distribution is the best choice . in ",
    "[ mass_model ] , we will discuss the constraints on the mass distribution from the weak gravitational lensing observations .",
    "we will then add a hydrostatic equilibrium model for the gas and define the @xmath106 function in ",
    "[ gas_model ]      symmetry    projection always involves loss of information .",
    "therefore , de - projection requires symmetry assumptions .",
    "since we are interested in elongated clusters , it is natural to consider ellipsoidal symmetry .",
    "analytically , the de - projection is simplest if the gas properties , and thus the gravitational potential , are constant on a family of similar , concentric , coaxial ellipsoids . unfortunately , there is no guarantee that a given ellipsoidal potential will correspond to a physically sensible mass density distribution , @xmath107 . in particular , for isothermal gas , the ellipsoidal generalization of the usual @xmath108-model for cluster x - ray emissivity has a potential @xmath109 however , for prolate ellipsoids with axis ratio greater than @xmath110 , the corresponding density distribution becomes dumbbell - shaped , which is unlikely for a cluster in equilibrium . for oblate ellipsoids with axis ratio less than @xmath111 ,",
    "the density actually becomes negative in some regions .",
    "thus , while the ellipsoidal potential model was useful for demonstrating the distance - elongation degeneracy and its resolution analytically in  [ degeneracy ] , it is not necessarily the best model to use in practice .",
    "therefore , we will instead assume that the total mass density is constant on similar ellipsoids .",
    "this ensures a sensible mass distribution .",
    "however , it also means that the isopotentials will not in general be ellipsoids .",
    "in addition , the shapes of the isopotentials will depend not only on the shape of the isodensity contours , but on the density profile , @xmath112 , as well .",
    "thus , we can not construct a model to predict the x - ray and sz effect observations until we have determined the density profile .",
    "consequently , we must break the construction of the model into two steps .",
    "first , we construct a set of possible mass models , including both the shape and the density profile , as constrained by the gravitational lensing observations . for each mass model",
    ", we calculate the gravitational potential .",
    "second , we add the intracluster gas in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this allows us to predict the x - ray and sz effect observations , and to adjust the free parameters of both the mass and gas models to find the best fit .",
    "have fit triaxial models to the mass within isodensity contours of simulated clusters .",
    "they find that the orientation of the axes is relatively stable as a function of density , though the central regions tend to be more elongated .",
    "however , to keep the number of model parameters to a minimum , we use ellipsoids of fixed shape and orientation .",
    "the shape of a triaxial ellipsoidal mass distribution is described by a pair of axis ratios .",
    "the orientation relative to the observer s line of sight is specified by three euler angles .",
    "these five parameters , together with the density profile , @xmath112 , characterize the mass distribution .",
    "there is an additional arbitrary choice of scale in the definition of @xmath113 .",
    "however , a re - scaling of @xmath112 can always compensate for a change in the choice of scale , so the scale is not an additional parameter .",
    "the weak gravitational lensing observations measure the convergence , @xmath114 .",
    "the critical surface density depends on @xmath0 , but the product @xmath115 does not .",
    "thus , we can measure the product @xmath116    for an ellipsoidal mass distribution , @xmath112 , the projected mass density will be constant on a family of similar ellipses , parameterized by a single axis ratio and a single orientation angle . by fitting an elliptical projected mass distribution to the lensing data , we obtain these two parameters , together with @xmath117 as a function of the elliptical coordinate , @xmath118 , defined analogously to the ellipsoidal `` radius '' , @xmath88",
    ". uncertainties in the lensing data will of course allow for some variation in these quantities .",
    "for now , however , we will assume that they are fixed .",
    "since the shape and orientation of the ellipsoidal distribution are described by five parameters , there will still be three free parameters required to uniquely determine the shape and orientation of the mass distribution , even with perfect lensing information .",
    "first , consider a particular member of this three - dimensional parameter space ; suppose that the surfaces of constant density are prolate axisymmetric ellipsoids generated by rotating the elliptical contours of projected mass about their major axis .",
    "then , we can de - project to find the density profile @xmath119 in the same way one de - projects a spherical distribution .    to obtain the rest of the possible ellipsoidal de - projections , we consider the three families of transformations which map ellipsoids into ellipsoids without changing the projected mass distribution .",
    "specifically , one family corresponds to a stretching along the line of sight , @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 is the elongation of the isodensity contours relative to the prolate case .",
    "the other two families correspond to shear transformations , @xmath123 where @xmath124 characterized by a @xmath125-vector , @xmath126 , in which the mass is displaced along the line of sight by an amount , @xmath127 , proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "the stretching transformation does not commute with the shearing transformation , so we must specify the order in which they are applied . for a given elliptical projected mass distribution , we obtain a particular de - projection from the canonical prolate case by shearing it by @xmath126 , and then stretching it along the line of sight by @xmath128 .",
    "we will test various values of @xmath122 and @xmath126 , and use the x - ray and sz effect observations to determine the best values .",
    "all the projected observables are invariant under a reflection through the plane of the sky , which corresponds to @xmath129 , so it is impossible to tell which end of the cluster is pointing at us .",
    "ellipsoidal clusters axisymmetric about the line of sight , for which @xmath130 , have an axis ratio equal to @xmath122 . in the general case of triaxial ellipsoids of arbitrary orientation , that will no longer be true .",
    "the axis ratios will depend in a complicated manner on the axis ratio of the elliptical projected mass distribution , the magnitude and orientation ( with respect to the projected ellipse ) of the shear , @xmath126 , and on @xmath122 .    to be more precise ,",
    "the shear transformation preserves the thickness , @xmath131 of the canonical prolate ellipsoid at fixed @xmath42 .",
    "however , it increases the total extent , @xmath132 in @xmath133 spanned by the ellipsoid .",
    "thus an ellipsoid with @xmath134 has the same thickness as the canonical prolate ellipsoid , but can have a much larger extent in the @xmath133 direction .",
    "the subsequent stretching increases both the thickness , @xmath135 , and the extent , @xmath136 , by a factor of @xmath137 .",
    "nonetheless , for lack of a better term , we will continue to refer to @xmath122 as the line of sight elongation .",
    "finally , note that the isopotentials of an ellipsoidal mass distribution are rounder than the isodensity contours ( and are in general not ellipsoids ) . thus ,",
    "even in the @xmath130 case , the typical elongation , @xmath4 of the isopotentials , which determines the ratio of true distance to that inferred from the spherical method , will be smaller than the axis ratio of the mass distribution .",
    "conversely , for clusters in hydrostatic equilibrium , the axis ratio of the mass distribution will be greater than the typical values estimated from the shapes of x - ray isophotes .",
    "the calculation of the potential of an ellipsoidal mass distribution has been extensively discussed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since we are working in coordinates in radians , @xmath138 so the potential , @xmath139 , is defined in terms of the combination @xmath140 which is determined by the observations , independent of @xmath0 .",
    "it is convenient to choose the zero point of the potential at the center of the cluster .",
    "note that the hydrostatic equilibrium condition , equation  ( [ hydrostatic ] ) , has the same form in terms of the dimensionless @xmath141 , as long as the pressure is also differentiated with respect to @xmath141 .",
    "once we have the cluster potential , @xmath139 , we can add the intracluster gas .",
    "in hydrostatic equilibrium , the gas can be described by its temperature profile , @xmath142 and the central electron density , @xmath143 . to minimize @xmath106 numerically",
    ", we need a discrete parameterization for the temperature profile . we let @xmath144 be a polynomial of fixed order in @xmath59 .",
    "we then integrate equation  ( [ dimensionless_pressure_balance ] ) to obtain the density profile , @xmath145 . from the density and temperature profiles",
    ", we can calculate the electron pressure and x - ray emissivity in each energy band .",
    "using @xmath139 , and including a factor of @xmath13 for the path length , we can project to predict the sz effect temperature decrement and the x - ray surface brightness . given a model of the instruments used to observe the cluster",
    ", we can convert these predictions to the measured quantities .",
    "the predictions depend on the various parameters of the model .",
    "they depend nonlinearly on the elongation and shear , @xmath122 and @xmath126 , which fix the shape and normalization of the deprojected mass distribution , as well as on the central electron density , @xmath143 , and the temperature profile , @xmath142 .",
    "finally , they are proportional to the angular diameter distance , @xmath13 , to the cluster .    we construct a @xmath106 function for the x - ray and sz effect measurements in the usual way , weighting the square of the differences between the observations and the model predictions by the reciprocal of the variance of each measurement .",
    "we apply the chain rule to calculate the partial derivatives of @xmath106 with respect to the gas parameters and the distance .",
    "the dependence on the shape of the cluster is more complicated .",
    "we therefore break the @xmath106 minimization problem into an inner part and an outer part . for a fixed set of shape parameters ,",

    "this special role for the lensing data is a direct consequence of our choice of symmetry assumption for the mass distribution ; the shape of the isopotentials contours depends on the mass profile , and not just on the shape of the mass distribution .    as a result",

    "we use two sets of true clusters .",
    "first , we consider ellipsoidal clusters axisymmetric about the line of sight , which we fit with models with the same symmetry .",
    "this allows us to treat the observables as functions of one variable , the angular radius , @xmath156 .",
    "it also reduces the shape parameter space from three dimensions to one , the mass elongation , @xmath122 relative to spherical .",
    "both changes greatly reduce the cpu time required for the inversion .",

    "we normalize each density profile to produce the same projected mass , regardless of the elongation .",
    "thus , we are testing whether the x - ray and sz effect measurements allow us to distinguish between clusters with identical lensing observations .",
    "recall that the elongation , @xmath4 , of the potential , which directly affects the inferred distance , is generally smaller than @xmath122 .",

    "of course , neither this assumed value of @xmath186 nor that of @xmath13 is used by the de - projection procedure .",
    "next , we need to create artificial observations of these cluster models , both the true clusters and the trial models used in the @xmath106 fitting . our goal is to see how the observational noise and uncertainties affect our ability to recover the true shape and distance .",

    "otherwise , we use the same models to create both sets of artificial observations .      as we mentioned in ",
    "[ gas_model ] , incorporating uncertainties in the weak gravitational lensing measurements requires additional monte carlo testing of the entire de - projection analysis .",
    "because of this , as well as rapid advances in the weak lensing observations , we have entirely ignored the weak lensing uncertainties in our initial tests .",
    "instead , we use the exact de - projection of the density profile of the true cluster . in doing so",
    ", we are also not restricting ourselves to using only the weak shear information .",
    "thus , while we showed in ",
    "[ breaking ] that the elongation could be recovered from the weak shear alone , our numerical tests do not demonstrate this .",
    "we base our artificial sz effect observations roughly on the maps made by fitting the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter - wave interferometer with @xmath187 ( @xmath188 wavelength ) receivers @xcite . at this frequency , the proportionality constant between the temperature decrement and the compton @xmath27-parameter in equation  ( [ define_decrement ] ) differs slightly from @xmath189 .",

    "clusters of galaxies , however , are large compared to the angular resolution of interferometric arrays . the ability to measure the temperature decrement on large scales",
    "is limited by the shortest baselines .",
    "therefore , these observations are generally made with the array in a nearly close - packed configuration to maximize sensitivity to the sz temperature decrement on cluster scales , with some longer baselines for detection and removal of point sources .",
    "for ovro , this system produces a roughly @xmath196 beam and maps with an rms noise of @xmath197 per beam in the temperature decrement with @xmath198 of observations @xcite .",

    "such close - packed configurations produce `` dirty '' beams which are actually smooth , so the data can be analyzed in real space @xcite .",
    "the temperature decrement measurements have gaussian white noise , so the noise remains uniform and gaussian when transformed to real space .",
    "the physical separation of the dishes must be greater than the diameter of the individual dishes .",
    "this limits the shortest baselines measured , which results in a hole in the fourier space coverage . in real space , the effect of this hole is approximately equivalent to subtracting the diffraction limited image which would be produced by a single dish from an image with the diffraction limit of the entire array .",
    "this gives an effective beam which has a total area of zero , as appropriate for interferometric observations with no measurements at zero - spacing .",
    "for the ovro array , each dish has a @xmath199 diameter , corresponding to a diffraction limit of @xmath200 at @xmath187 .    for simplicity , in the axisymmetric case , we limit the field of view of our temperature decrement observations to @xmath201 in radius , covered with three @xmath196 annuli , and remove the short baselines by subtracting the average temperature decrement over this field from the individual annuli .",
    "this simple approach produces the correct spatial resolution and noise per pixel , but it reduces the field of view and the total number of pixels .",
    "it also ties the diameter of the field of view to the dish size , preventing us from changing one without changing the other .    for clusters with arbitrary orientation ,",
    "the field of view is no longer circular , so this approach no longer makes sense .",
    "therefore , we use an @xmath202 field of view , with a rectangular grid of @xmath196 pixels , to represent the image with the diffraction limit of the entire array .",
    "we then convolve this image with a gaussian of unit area and full width at half maximum equal to the single dish diffraction limit and subtract the convolved image from the original .      for our artificial x - ray observations",
    ", we use a simplified model of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on the chandra x - ray observatory as described by the @xcite .",
    "the four front - illuminated ccd chips of the acis - i imaging configuration have @xmath203 pixels over a @xmath204 field of view .",
    "the half - energy radius varies roughly from 1 to 10 pixels from the center of the field of view to an off - axis angle of @xmath205 .",
    "the full spatial resolution is unnecessary for our purposes , so in the axisymmetric case , we use @xmath206 annuli , each @xmath207 wide , out to a radius of @xmath208 . in the case of the clusters of arbitrary orientation , we use a @xmath209 rectangular grid covering and @xmath210 field of view ( one - quarter of the chandra acis - i field ) , giving @xmath211 pixels .",
    "this resolution is quite crude , but is necessary to ensure that the chi - squared fitting can be performed in a reasonable amount of cpu time .    for simplicity , we ignore x - ray line emission and consider only thermal bremsstrahlung . the acis energy resolution varies with energy and position on the chips .",
    "however it is generally @xmath212 .",
    "we create maps in @xmath168 energy bands of this width between @xmath213 and @xmath214 . to calculate the count rates",
    ", we multiply the x - ray surface brightness for each band by the angular area of each annulus and by the effective area of each band .",

    "we multiply the count rates by an assumed @xmath227 observation time to find the expected number of counts in each band and annulus , and add poisson fluctuations to these counts . note that when we compute the poisson uncertainties in the number of counts for the @xmath106 function , we use the mean values . with actual observations , only the measured number of counts including noise would be known .",
    "this would introduce a bias to actual observations , which would have to be corrected .",
    "the projected gas observables , the x - ray surface brightness and the temperature decrement , are approximated by discrete sums as described in the appendix .",

    "such a brute force grid search is no longer feasible .",
    "instead , we use a general - purpose multidimensional minimization routine based on powell s method . to ensure that the minimization routine has converged , we restart it twice at the previous minimum . in practice",
    ", there was no significant change in the solution after the first restart .    to find the initial guess for this minimization routine",

    "we initially evaluate the integrated @xmath106 at the center of each cell and find the cell with the smallest value .",
    "we then refine the grid by evaluating @xmath106 in a 3 by 3 by 3 grid within this cell .",
    "the shape with the smallest integrated @xmath106 is used as the initial guess for the minimization routine .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we need a discrete parameterization for the temperature profile .",
    "we take @xmath231 be a polynomial of fixed order in @xmath59 . in the axisymmetric case , we used a fourth order polynomial . in the general case , we found that a third order polynomial was more effective in avoiding unphysical oscillations in the temperature profile in the initial guess for the cluster shape was poor .",
    "the inner minimization , with respect to the gas parameters and the distance , also requires an initial guess .",
    "we guess a constant temperature profile of @xmath232 , roughly equal to the true central temperature of @xmath233 . in the axisymmetric case , we take the central electron density to be twice the true value , and the distance to be @xmath234 of the true value . in the general case ,",
    "we take the central density to be @xmath235 times the true value , and the distance to be @xmath153 times the true value .",
    "as long as the initial guess for the temperature is not too extreme , the code rapidly converges to essentially the same best fit set of parameters , regardless of the choice of initial guess .",
    "using a fairly accurate initial guess for the central temperature is realistic since the central temperature of a relaxed cluster should be reasonably well determined from the overall emission - weighted spectrum .",
    "for each test case , we create 20 realizations of the artificial observations with noise , which are analyzed independently .",
    "this allows us to estimate the uncertainties in the parameters inferred from a single observation due to statistical uncertainties in the measurements .",

    "additional monte carlo tests with realistic treatment of these uncertainties , and their effects on the fitting and de - projection of the surface mass distribution , should be performed .      besides the statistical measurement uncertainties , there are number of systematic effects which could affect our determination of the cluster distances and of @xmath0 . many of these effects are also relevant to the traditional method based on a spherical model",
    ". for recent reviews of the systematic uncertainties , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will focus primarily on those effects which are particular to our method .",
    "we first discuss the dependence of the inferred @xmath0 on the magnitude of the observed quantities , and the resulting bias due to either contamination of these observations or to errors in their absolute calibration .",
    "then , we consider aspects of the state of the intracluster gas which could violate the underlying physical assumptions of our model . finally , we mention some caveats regarding our assumption of ellipsoidal symmetry .",
    "the distance determination depends on the normalizations of the measured temperature decrement , x - ray surface brightness , and x - ray temperature .",
    "therefore , calibration errors or other systematic errors in these observations will directly affect the value of @xmath0 inferred .",
    "in the traditional method , @xmath249 assuming that the value for @xmath0 has been averaged over sufficiently many clusters of random orientation to remove the effect of the elongation . for a single cluster , there would be an additional factor of the inverse of the gas elongation , @xmath4 . in our method , @xmath0 can , in principle , be inferred from a single cluster by correcting for this factor .",

    ", we can show that the inferred gas elongation , @xmath250 recall that the product @xmath99 is independent of the distance to the lensing cluster , @xmath64 , and depends only on the cosmology and the redshifts of the cluster and the lensed sources . combining equations  ( [ traditional_systematics ] ) and ( [ elongation_dependence ] )",
    ", we see that for our method , @xmath251 thus , our method and the traditional method have the same sensitivity to errors in the normalization of the x - ray surface brightness or the temperature decrement .",
    "possible sources of contamination of these measurements , as well as uncertainties in their calibration , are discussed by @xcite .    due to the fortuitous cancellation of one power of the electron temperature between equations  ( [ traditional_systematics ] ) and ( [ elongation_dependence ] )",
    ", we expect our method to be less sensitive to the electron temperature than the traditional method . nonetheless , the inferred value of @xmath0 will still be directly proportional to the absolute calibration of the x - ray temperature , as well as that of the surface brightness .",
    "our method introduces a new dependence on the calibration of the weak lensing observations .",
    "our inferred @xmath0 is now proportional to the normalization of the lensing potential , @xmath97 , ( or its second derivatives , the convergence , @xmath60 , and the shear , @xmath104 ) as well as to @xmath252 for measurements of weak shear from the shapes of background galaxies , the normalization of the inferred shear depends on accurately correcting for the seeing conditions .",
    "calculating @xmath253 requires knowledge of the redshift distribution of the background galaxies , and of the choice of cosmology ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) which affect the shape of the redshift - distance relation .",
    "note that all lensing measurements depend on @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to eliminate the cosmology dependence if the redshift distribution is itself inferred from lensing measurements .",
    "several techniques have been suggested for doing so @xcite .",
    "our analytic models in  [ degeneracy ] demonstrated that the elongation - distance degeneracy could be broken without resolving the mass sheet degeneracy in the lensing observations .",
    "however , while we have proven this in principle , we have not yet demonstrated it in practice . in fact , our assumption in  [ mass_model ] that the product @xmath117 was known presumes that the mass sheet degeneracy has been resolved . this could be done by measuring the convergence .",
    "alternatively , we can assume that the surface density falls to negligible values far from the center of the cluster .",
    "given shear observations over a wide enough field , this may be sufficient .",
    "finally , the method might be reformulated to remove any dependence on the mass sheet degeneracy .      in comparing @xmath254 inferred from the x - ray observations with @xmath8 inferred from the temperature decrement , both our method and",
    "the traditional one assume that the x - ray emission and the scattering of the microwave background photons is due to the same population of electrons .",
    "if the intracluster gas is not smooth but rather clumpy , with @xmath255 , then the inferred distance to the cluster will be systematically underestimated by a factor of @xmath256 @xcite .",
    "in addition , a multiphase medium introduces additional degrees of freedom which may make it impossible to constrain the elongation .",
    "the gas in the cooling flows observed in the centers of some clusters is in fact believed to be multiphase . in applying the our method to real clusters",
    ", it would be advisable to remove any cooling flow region from the x - ray maps and fit to the remaining data .",
    "our method of inferring the elongation depends on the assumption that the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the cluster potential well .",
    "a distinct advantage of the traditional method is that it does not rely on this assumption .",
    "the characteristic time for a cluster to reach hydrostatic equilibrium is the sound wave crossing time .",
    "the high temperature of the intracluster gas makes this time scale much shorter than the hubble time @xcite .",
    "however , clusters which have undergone recent mergers may not have had time to fully relax .",
    "mergers tend to increase the x - ray luminosity of clusters , so cluster samples selected by luminosity will tend to include an enhanced fraction of mergers @xcite .",
    "deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium could introduce either random or systematic errors in our elongation correction .",
    "we have also implicitly assumed that thermal pressure is the dominant source of support for the gas .",
    "other possible sources include rotation , magnetic or turbulent pressure , or pressure from a population of relativistic electrons and ions .",
    "if these were significant , our method would give incorrect results for the elongation and the distance .",
    "it is essential to quantify these possible errors by applying the method to a set of simulated clusters .",
    "real clusters will differ from the models we use to fit them , and this may also introduce both random and systematic errors . typically , measurements of @xmath0 from x - ray and sz effect observations have used a beta model to fit the gas density distribution .",
    "often , in the absence of spatially resolved x - ray temperature measurements , an isothermal temperature has also been assumed .",
    "a number of authors have estimated the systematic effects in the traditional method due to deviations from these model assumptions , as well as that of spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "we have tried to take advantage of the improved spectral resolution of the latest x - ray telescopes , and of anticipated improvements in observations of the sz effect , to relax these assumptions about the density and temperature profiles of the gas , allowing them to the constrained only by the observations and by the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "even so , de - projecting clusters still requires a fairly strong assumption about symmetry .",
    "we have assumed that the cluster mass distribution is constant on families of similar , concentric , coaxial ellipsoids .",
    "our hope is that such a model will be sufficient for inferring to first order the deviation from spherical symmetry due to elongation .",
    "however , x - ray clusters often show evidence for significant irregularity and substructure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the deviations from our model are large enough , it may fail to fit the observations , or , worse , give misleading answers .",
    "for example , our model would be unlikely to give correct results when applied to a cluster which was actually two clusters along the same line of sight ( unless one of the two clusters dominated all three of our observational probes , or unless the two shared a common envelope ) .",
    "selection effects in the detection of gravitational lensing could bias a sample of clusters toward such cases .",
    "even fairly regular clusters will not have the perfect ellipsoidal symmetry we have assumed .",
    "they may be elongated but not ellipsoidal",
    ". they may be roughly ellipsoidal , but with smaller scale irregularities , or with axis ratios and orientations which vary with radius .",
    "again , the best way to quantify the resulting uncertainties , both random and systematic , is to apply the method to a sample of simulated clusters , with realistic modeling of the selection effects .",
    "mass in filaments and other correlated structure near clusters contributes significantly to the total projected mass measured by lensing , and to its scatter , though the magnitudes of both the bias and the scatter depend on the particular mass estimator used @xcite . by applying our method to numerically simulated clusters",
    ", we will be able to tell how much of an effect this has on the inferred distances .",
    "x - ray and sz effect observations provide a geometric method of measuring the distance to clusters of galaxies , independent of the usual distance ladder calibrations .",
    "this method can be used to measure the redshift - distance relation and inferred the value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the method is subject to an exact degeneracy between the distance and the elongation of the cluster along the line of sight , relative to its size perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "this degeneracy introduces significant scatter in the measured values of @xmath0 , requiring a large sample of clusters of random orientation for an accurate determination . to infer @xmath2 and @xmath3 by the redshift - distance relation",
    "would require an even larger sample .",
    "furthermore , if the sample is biased towards particular orientations due to selection effects , this would introduce a systematic error in @xmath0 .",
    "the elongation - distance degeneracy can be broken if the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium , and if the projected mass density can be inferred from gravitational lensing measurements of background galaxies .",
    "we have developed a specific method to do so , using models with ellipsoidal mass distributions , and applied it to simple axisymmetric ellipsoidal model clusters .",
    "we recover the true shape and distance to each cluster with statistical uncertainties of @xmath5 to @xmath257 , and no detectable systematic bias ( with a @xmath238 upper limit of @xmath246 ) , using artificial x - ray and sz effect observations with sensitivity comparable to current observations .",
    "further work is necessary to determine the sensitivity of the method to realistic uncertainties in the lensing observations .",
    "particular attention should be paid to possible systematic uncertainties due to the mass sheet degeneracy , and to the dependence of the critical surface density on the redshift distribution of the lensed background galaxies .",
    "the systematic uncertainties in the calibration of the x - ray surface brightness and temperature observations and the sz effect observations are also important .",
    "finally , real clusters are not the perfectly regular , ellipsoidal objects we have assumed in our models , nor are they necessarily in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "it is essential to test the method by applying it to numerically simulated clusters , which more closely resemble real clusters , at least in their greater degree of messiness .",
    "we would like to thank abraham loeb for suggesting combining x - ray and lensing observations to infer the line of sight elongation of clusters , and for his advice on an earlier incarnation of this project .",
    "this work was supported by a national science foundation graduate research fellowship for d. c. f .. many thanks to laura grego and chris metzler for useful discussions , and to irwin shapiro for pulling at a loose thread in the preliminary results .",
    "one of the authors ( d. c. f. ) would like to acknowledge dragon systems , inc .",
    ", whose dragondictate for windows and dragon naturallyspeaking software were essential to the development of the code for this calculation and to the preparation of this paper .",
    "since the gas properties are constant on isopotentials , the projection of a local gas quantity , @xmath258 , is @xmath259 the projection operator is linear , and we already have a finite set of @xmath152 lines of sight , @xmath260 , so an obvious approach is to discretize the local quantity , and calculate a projection matrix , @xmath261 . we pick a finite grid in @xmath59 , @xmath262 .",
    "then , the projection reduces to a matrix - vector multiplication , @xmath263 where @xmath264 .",
    "similarly , the gradient with respect to the gas parameters , @xmath265 , is simply a matrix - matrix multiplication , @xmath266    to calculate the elements of the projection matrix , @xmath261 , we replace @xmath267 in equation  ( [ projection_equation ] ) with a linear interpolation in @xmath59 between the grid points .",
    "when @xmath268 , we let @xmath269 .",
    "for each line of sight , we cut off the integral at @xmath270 .",
    "the elements of @xmath261 , depend only on the potential , @xmath139 , the potential grid , and the set of lines of sight , not on the local gas properties , @xmath271 ( or @xmath272 ) .",
    "thus , we can use the same matrix for all x - ray bands , and for all trials with a single assumed cluster shape .",
    "the correct choice of the cutoff , @xmath273 , is rather delicate . because it is proportional to the electron density squared , the x - ray emission along a given line of sight is dominated by the contribution from isopotentials near the minimum of @xmath274 with respect to @xmath133 .",
    "if @xmath273 is too large , none of the lines of sight will have a minimum potential comparable to it . in that case",
    ", the gas properties at that isopotential will be poorly constrained , and minimizing @xmath106 may lead to an unphysical temperature profile .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath273 is too small , the cluster emission will be artificially cut off at some radius within the field of view .",
    "this radius may not be the same for both the model cluster and the true cluster , which will lead to systematic problems in the fitting .",
    "in addition , fixing @xmath273 to a single value for all models tends to bias the shape fitting .",
    "more elongated de - projections have shallower potential wells , so a fixed grid in @xmath59 effectively reduces the angular resolution of these models , making their @xmath106 values artificially large .    to avoid all these difficulties , we want to choose @xmath273 for each model shape so as to ensure that the outermost lines of sight in the field view are tangent to @xmath270 . in the axisymmetric case",
    ", this simply means setting @xmath273 equal to the minimum of the potential along a line of sight with the maximum radius . in the general case , we evaluate the minimum of the potential along the lines of sight at each corner and in the center of each edge of the field of view , and choose @xmath273 equal to the largest such minimum .",
    "we use a uniform grid in the potential with 20 elements between @xmath171 and @xmath273 .",
