    "strong gravitational lensing occurs when a background source is multiply imaged by the gravitational field of an intervening massive galaxy or cluster of galaxies .",
    "observations of gravitational lenses have been used in many astrophysical applications , such as in modelling the mass distributions of distant galaxies and as constraints on cosmological models @xcite .",
    "class ( cosmic lens all - sky survey ; @xcite ) and jvas ( jodrell bank - vla astrometric survey ; @xcite ) are radio surveys of the northern sky designed to find gravitationally lensed compact radio sources . in jvas and class",
    "11685 sources in a statistically well - defined sample have been examined and 22 lens systems found . in this paper",
    ", we announce the discovery of the last of these systems , class b0631 + 519 .",
    "this lens system exhibits complex radio structure over scales from 3.6  mas to 1.16  arcsec and has a nearly complete infrared einstein ring , similar to that in b1938 + 666 @xcite .",
    "it is a system with one of the richest lensed image structures known and is thus an ideal system with which to probe mass properties of the lensing galaxy .",
    "b0631 + 519 is a member of the class statistically complete sample .    in section [ secradobs ]",
    "we discuss radio observations of b0631 + 519 made using the very large array ( vla ) , very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the multi - element radio - linked interferometer network ( merlin ; @xcite ) .",
    "section [ secoptobs ] presents optical and near - infrared images taken with the william herschel telescope ( wht ) and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) . in section [ secmodel ]",
    "we consider the data in the context of the lens hypothesis and test some simple lens models , and in section [ secconclude ] we conclude by discussing the future priorities for work on this lens .",
    "as described in @xcite and @xcite , potential lens candidates from class are tested by observing them with a range of angular resolutions and at several different frequencies .",
    "if the supposed multiple images in a lens candidate are found to have very different surface brightnesses at any angular resolution the lens hypothesis can usually be rejected immediately , since lensing preserves surface brightness . in class",
    ", candidates discovered with the vla are observed with higher resolution using merlin , and , if not eliminated at this stage , are re - observed with even higher resolution using the vlba .",
    "accordingly , radio observations of b0631 + 519 have been made over frequencies ranging from 1.7  ghz to 15  ghz , with angular resolutions from 3.6  mas to 236  mas .",
    "the observations are summarised in table [ radobs ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , we fixed the galaxy position to that determined optically in section [ secoptobs ] , and added an external shear to the model .",
    "this sie+shear model was then fitted to the merlin image positions and flux densities .",
    "the optimum model had a reduced @xmath2 of only 0.07 for 1 degree of freedom , suggesting that the random errors on the constraints were over - estimated . reducing the flux density errors from 20% to 5% results in a reduced @xmath2 of 0.5 which is dominated by the contributions from the image positions .",
    "the optimum model parameters do not change significantly when the flux density errors are reduced .",
    "the optimum model parameters are listed in table [ modelst ] and the model is illustrated in figure [ modelsf ] .",
    "we note that the position of the best sie - only lens is consistent with the optical lens position within the errors . the time delay between a1 and b1",
    "is predicted to be 10.2 @xmath3 days with the sie model or 8.5 @xmath3 days with the sie+shear model for a source redshift of 3.14 .",
    "days ( for the first contour surrounding a1/a2 ) and increase in steps of 2.05 @xmath3 days . in the lower panel ,",
    "the first contour surrounding a1/a2 represents 1.11 @xmath3 days and the contours increase in steps of 1.88 @xmath3 days .",
    "the contour levels are calculated for a source redshift of 3.14 , and should be multiplied by a factor of 3.5 for @xmath4 .",
    "the lensed images are represented by filled circles .",
    "the inset diagram shows the source plane ; the astroid curve is the 4-image caustic , and filled circles represent the modelled source positions .",
    "the estimated position of the source responsible for images y , z and the arc x is marked by a light grey filled circle .",
    ", width=264 ]    the lens modelling we have performed shows that the a1 , a2 , b1 and b2 components can be understood as lensed images of two distinct sources .",
    "it seems that a1 and b1 are images of a compact radio core having a flat ( synchrotron self - absorbed ) spectrum , while a2 and b2 arise from a more extended region of emission to the west of the core , probably a radio lobe .",
    "images a1 and a2 have positive parity , while images b1 and b2 have negative parity .",
    "incorporating images x , y and z is more difficult because they are all relatively extended compared to the a and b images , and the radio spectra indicate that these images arise from a third source .",
    "back - projecting the positions of the y and z images ( from the 1.7  ghz merlin data ) to the source plane , along with the brightest point on arc x , produces an approximate source position of @xmath50.41east and @xmath60.49north relative to a1 ( marked on figure [ modelsf ] ) .",
    "the model thus suggests that the x , y and z images are produced by a counter - lobe on the eastern side of the source that happens to lie inside the 4-image caustic . with only the vla data , showing x and y but no z , a model involving emission only on the western side of the source s core might also be plausible .",
    "the blue color of galaxy l2 and its consequent apparent absence in the hst - nicmos f160w image , allows us to make use of the infrared einstein ring to further test the validity of the lens mass model of class 0631 + 519 , which is based on the merlin radio data alone .",
    "the einstein ring is de - lensed ( see @xcite ) , using the sie plus shear model from table [ modelst ] .",
    "it is stressed that the lens mass model is _ not _ adjusted in any way to better fit the observed einstein ring .",
    "a tinytim generated psf is used to account for blurring of the image .",
    "the structure of the einstein ring is remarkably well reproduced ( figure [ delensed ] ) , given that the lens mass model was only fitted to the radio jet structure . despite the overall good quality of the reconstruction , a clear deviation from the model is found in the residual image , just north of l1 on the einstein ring and slightly offset from the position of l2 .",
    "neither varying the mass model , nor alleviating the regularization can remove the feature completely .",
    "we propose two possible explanations for this apparent `` anomaly '' : ( a ) it is due to residual emission from l2  still present at a low level in the nicmos - f160w image  or a dwarf - galaxy associated with l1 , or ( b ) it is due to a small - scale perturbation of the lens mass model by the presence of l2 , creating an anomaly in the ring @xcite similar to flux - ratio anomalies in compact lensed sources ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "although the first explanation(s ) can not be completely excluded , the anomaly is situated near the brightness peak of the einstein ring , appears to follow the curvature of the ring and is offset from the centroid of l2 .",
    "each of these observations seem to support the second explanation . as shown in @xcite",
    ", one would indeed expect such anomalies in einstein rings , as a result of tiny perturbations of the dominant lens potential .",
    "the foreground galaxy l2 could provide the required perturbation .",
    "a full analysis of the nature of the anomaly , however , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "pixel grid with a scale of 0.02 arcsec  pix@xmath7 .",
    "we mask all image pixels below 3@xmath0 ( indicated in the image reconstruction ; @xmath8  counts  pix@xmath7 ) .",
    "the regularization parameter for the source is @xmath9 , resulting in @xmath10 .",
    "we use a regularization matrix that minimizes the curvature of the source ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that a significant `` anomaly '' is left in the residual image ( see text ) .",
    "the two circles in the residual image indicate the centroids of l1 ( at the origin of the plot ) and l2 at @xmath60.33  arcsec east , @xmath50.74  arcsec north of l1,width=302 ]      we have sufficient information to estimate the b - band mass - to - light ratio of l1 in the region enclosed by the lensed images .",
    "the mass @xmath11 between the lensed images of a source ( in the case of a circularly symmetric lens ) is related to the image separation @xmath12 and the angular diameter distances @xmath13 ( observer to lens ) , @xmath14 ( observer to source ) and @xmath15 ( lens to source ) by    @xmath16    where @xmath12 is given in arcseconds .",
    "the estimate is significantly affected by the unknown source redshift ( but not by assumptions concerning the distribution of mass inside the radius of the images ) .",
    "the ratio of angular diameter distances in equation [ einmass ] decreases by a factor of @xmath173.5 when the source redshift is increased from 0.8 to 3.14 .",
    "we therefore estimate the lensing mass using both of the suggested redshifts for the source listed in @xcite , since they conveniently span most of the range of plausible source redshifts . the separation between images a1 and b1 is 1.162@xmath180.003  arcsec , which at the redshift of l1 corresponds to a linear distance of @xmath19  kpc . from equation [ einmass ]",
    "we estimate the mass of l1 within the images at @xmath20 @xmath21 using a source redshift of @xmath4 or @xmath22 @xmath21 using @xmath23 . combining these estimates with the rest frame b - band absolute magnitudes derived from the srsic profile",
    "fits in section [ secredshifts ] ( corrected for a 1.16  arcsec diameter aperture ) produces estimates for the mass - to - light ratio of l1 in the b filter of @xmath24 @xmath25 using @xmath4 , or @xmath26 @xmath25 using @xmath23 .",
    "we have taken the absolute magnitude of the sun in b to be 5.54 .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio estimates apply to the central region of l1 encircled by the lensed images ( i.e. that within a mean radius of 2.8  @xmath3  kpc from l1 s centre ) .",
    "both figures are comparable with @xmath27 estimates from local ellipticals @xcite , although the figure for @xmath23 is relatively low given @xmath28 .",
    "together the radio and optical / near - infrared observations presented here show that class b0631 + 519 can be understood as a gravitational lens system .",
    "a simple sie+shear mass model successfully reproduces features of the radio observations , and a non - parametric approach to the near - infrared data has identified the perturbing effect of l2 on the smooth lensing properties of the system .",
    "the mass modelling done so far leads us to conclude that the background radio source probably consists of three radio components in a classic double - lobed core - jet arrangement .",
    "the eastern lobe is located inside the quad - image caustic for the system and is lensed into the arc x and the more compact images y and z. the core region is doubly imaged into a1 and b1 , while the western lobe is lensed into images a2 and b2 .",
    "the magnification provided by the lens and the high resolution of the vlba has allowed identification of the flat - spectrum agn core and revealed jet components from both the approaching and the receding jets .",
    "the near - infrared source centre coincides with the radio source positions to within the errors .",
    "the wealth of constraints available means that this system will benefit from application of deconvolution / inversion techniques that can utilise the extended images seen in the radio data .",
    "having a good mass model for this system will allow us insights into the mass distributions of ellipticals at redshifts of 0.6 , information that is not readily available in any other way .",
    "the hints of radio source variability mean that it may be possible to determine a radio time delay and use it to measure the hubble constant .",
    "this lens system is relatively unusual in having two galaxies of different redshifts present along the line of sight to the source , a situation that also occurs in class b2114 + 022 @xcite and in pks 1830 - 211 @xcite . in b2114 + 022 the effect of the nearer lens is much more significant than in b0631 + 519 @xcite . in pks 1830 - 211",
    "the nearer lens was detected through its hi absorption @xcite at a redshift of 0.19 ( the main lensing galaxy has a redshift of 0.886 ) .",
    "the correct interpretation of the optical data in pks 1830 - 211 is presently unclear , although the main lens is certainly a face - on spiral @xcite .",
    "although l2 appears to have a relatively minor influence on the lensing properties of b0631 + 519 , the radio emission from the lensed source must pass through l2 s ism .",
    "searches for molecular absorption lines may be worthwhile to provide extra information on the nature of this galaxy .",
    "the mass distribution in l2 may well be constrainable with further non - parametric modelling work .",
    "the authors would like to thank shude mao for useful discussions , and the referee , stephen warren , for comments that improved the clarity of the paper .",
