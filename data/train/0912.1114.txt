    "in contrast to the standard model of cosmology , there is a class of non - standard cosmological ( and/or particle physics ) models in which the expansion rate may differ from its standard model value , @xmath17 . in these non - standard models",
    "the expansion rate can be parameterized by an  expansion rate parameter \" , @xmath18 , or equivalently , by an  effective number of neutrinos \" , @xmath12@xmath19 , where s^2 ( h/h)^2 g/g1 + 7_/43 .",

    "one is that the post - bbn evolution of deuterium is simple and monotonic : as gas is cycled through stars ( producing the heavy elements ) , d is only destroyed ( ( * ? ? ?",
