    "scattering in a half - space and layered media , both acoustic and electromagnetic , has been a classic problem in the physics of waves for many decades",
    ". solutions for various boundary conditions have been formulated by van der pol@xcite , sommerfeld@xcite , and weyl@xcite .",
    "generalizations of this problem are of special interest in non - destructive testing of microchip fabrication , oil speculation , geological surveying , materials science , etc .",
    "there have been several methods and formulations developed to address the construction of the corresponding green s function@xcite and embed the resulting analysis into a fast numerical algorithm that can be used industrially@xcite .",
    "approaches which are based on the electric field dyadic green s function , however , commonly suffer from numerical instabilities in the static limit as the governing frequency @xmath0 tends to zero .",
    "this green s function includes a term of @xmath2 , which has to be necessarily offset by catastrophic numerical cancellation .",
    "the main purpose of this note is to present an alternative approach to the problem of electromagnetic scattering in layered media which does _ not _ suffer from numerical instabilities as @xmath1 .",
    "our approach is based on the generalized debye source representation@xcite of maxwell fields . using this representation , as @xmath1 , the electric field and the magnetic field gracefully and stably uncouple to their respective static limits .",
    "equations for the scattered electric field only depend upon the impinging electric field , and vice versa for the magnetic field .",
    "this is analogous to the behavior exhibited by the classic lorenz - debye - mie representation of maxwell fields in the exterior of a sphere@xcite .",
    "along the way , as motivation for the generalized debye source approach , we will also reformulate the mie series solution for spherical scattering as one which is based on plane waves and is compatible with planar cartesian geometries .    in focusing on electromagnetic waves in linear , isotropic , non - dispersive , planar layered domains ( and half - spaces )",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the time - harmonic case , assuming a dependence of @xmath3 which will be suppressed from now on . under these assumptions ,",
    "the fully time - dependent maxwell s equations reduce to the set of equations : @xmath4 where @xmath0 is the angular frequency , @xmath5 is the magnetic permeability , and @xmath6 is the electric permittivity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the physical electric current @xmath7 and electric charge @xmath8 must also satisfy the continuity condition @xmath9 the helmholtz parameter ( wavenumber ) @xmath10 will be assumed to have positive real part and non - negative imaginary part in order to ensure causality .",
    "this assumption on @xmath11 also causes all fields constructed from layer potentials using the helmholtz green s function to automatically satisfy the silver - mller decay condition at infinity : @xmath12    in this note , we will mainly be concerned with solving maxwell s equations in the context of scattering phenomena .",
    "in particular , we will write the _ total _",
    "fields @xmath13 , @xmath14 as the sum of a known incoming field and an unknown scattered field , i.e. @xmath15    historically , most of the effort in constructing solutions to maxwell s equations in a half - space and layered media has been focused on constructing the associated helmholtz ( arising in transverse electromagnetic problems ) or maxwell dyadic green s function@xcite ( as described in section  [ sec - dyadic ] ) . these approaches , while powerful and readily adaptable to different geometries , can suffer from numerical instabilities for small @xmath0 , and often require complicated quadrature schemes to handle a variety of non - generic singularities in the resulting integral representations ( as can be the case in the method of complex images@xcite ) .    in the following discussion , we propose an alternative approach to the problem of electromagnetic scattering in layered media which does not suffer from numerical instabilities as @xmath1 . to this end",
    ", our main result is a sommerfeld - like ( spectral ) formulation of the generalized debye source representation of maxwell fields which is well - conditioned for any value of @xmath0 , including @xmath16 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with that of the generalized debye source formalism in the case of scattering from arbitrary smooth bounded obstacles , unlike most representations based on the electric field dyadic green s function . in the presence of a perfectly conducting half - space ,",
    "our new representation completely decouples at _ any _ frequency @xmath0 , not only in the static case . in layered media geometries",
    ", there is an inter - layer coupling of unknowns which becomes weaker as @xmath1 . as a preliminary warm - up ,",
    "we first extend the lorenz - debye - mie construction of maxwell fields to cartesian planar domains .",
    "this derivation , while straight - forward and a natural limit of the spherical case , seems to be absent from the scattering literature . in the case of the perfectly conducting half - space ,",
    "the debye potentials are coupled via a two - by - two linear system .",
    "this extends to the layered media case with an inter - layer coupling of unknowns , with four debye potentials defined on each interface . as in the usual spherical mie representation ,",
    "the fields decouple as @xmath17 , resulting in formulas which are numerically stable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec - theproblem ] we describe the half - space and layered media electromagnetic scattering problems and introduce notation that will be used in the rest of the discussion .",
    "section  [ sec - dyadic ] briefly reviews some of the most common methods of constructing half - plane and layered media solutions , those based on the dyadic green s function for maxwell s equations .",
    "next , in section  [ sec - mie ] we introduce the first of our new representations for layered media scattering by extending the classic lorenz - mie - debye spherical representation of solutions to a half - space .",
    "the main contribution of this note is in section  [ sec - debye ] , where we extend the generalized debye source representation to an infinite half - space and layered media . both new representations in sections  [ sec - mie ] and  [ sec - debye ] provide formulas which are numerically stable in the low - frequency limit .",
    "section  [ sec - conclusions ] contains closing remarks on the methods previously introduced .",
    "lastly , the appendix contains useful fourier transform identities for ( spherical ) partial wave functions that can be used to analytically represent incoming fields in cartesian coordinates . using these formulae , an algorithm for scattering in layered media , analogous to mie scattering , can be derived .",
    "half - space and layered media electromagnetic scattering problems largely fall into three main categories : perfectly - conducting or impedance half - space problems , homogeneous bi - layer transmission problems , and multiple - layer transmission problems .",
    "see figure  [ fig-3probs ] for a graphical depiction of the geometry inherent in each class of problems .",
    "we will always assume that the region @xmath18 is homogeneous with material parameters @xmath6 , @xmath5 or ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 in the case of multiple layers ) .    in the case of a perfectly conducting half - space @xmath21 ,",
    "the four physical boundary conditions on the plane @xmath22 are : @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( the unit - normal in the @xmath25-direction ) and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the physical current and charge , respectively .",
    "depending on the representation of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , one or more of the above boundary conditions may be enforced , or a complex linear combination of multiple conditions may be used . using the standard representation of @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the lorenz gauge , @xmath28 conditions on the tangential fields",
    "lead to the electric field integral equation ( efie ) or the magnetic field integral equation ( mfie ) . above",
    ", @xmath29 is the green s function for the three - dimensional helmholtz equation with parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the efie is a hypersingular integral equation for the current @xmath7 which can be regularized@xcite via calderon projections , but still suffers from low - frequency breakdown .",
    "the mfie is stable on simply - connected geometries as @xmath1@xcite , but for sufficiently small @xmath0 the electric field can not be recovered without solving an additional integral equation@xcite .",
    "complex linear combinations of the efie and the mfie yield the combined - field integral equation ( cfie ) , which is free from spurious resonances in @xmath11 , however still susceptible to instabilities for small @xmath0@xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the scattered field from a perfectly conducting half - space adheres to the usual silver - mller radiation condition - this can be seen from an analysis of the domain green s function ( which is analytically given in section  [ sec - dyadic ] ) .    in the case of layered dielectric materials ,",
    "the physical transmission boundary conditions between layers can be phrased in terms of continuity in the tangential components of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , or in the normal components or normal derivatives of @xmath32 , @xmath33 : @xmath34      [ { \\boldsymbol n}\\times { \\boldsymbol e}^\\text{tot } ] & = 0 , & \\qquad [ { \\boldsymbol n}\\cdot      \\epsilon{\\boldsymbol e^\\text{tot } } ] & = 0 , & \\qquad \\left [ { \\boldsymbol n}\\cdot        \\epsilon\\frac{\\partial{\\boldsymbol e^\\text{tot}}}{\\partial n }      \\right ] & = 0 , \\\\      [ { \\boldsymbol n}\\times { \\boldsymbol h}^\\text{tot } ] & = 0 , & [ { \\boldsymbol n}\\cdot \\mu{\\boldsymbol h^\\text{tot } } ] & = 0 , &      \\left [ { \\boldsymbol n}\\cdot \\mu\\frac{\\partial{\\boldsymbol h^\\text{tot}}}{\\partial",
    "n } \\right ] & =      0 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the notation @xmath35 $ ] is used to denote the discontinuity in @xmath36 across the boundary .",
    "we use this notation as it is convenient for multiple layers .",
    "the usual formulation of dielectric problems under these boundary conditions is due to mller@xcite , which enforces the tangential boundary conditions .",
    "this formulation , however , still suffers from numerical instabilities as @xmath1 due to the integral representation that is used@xcite . in layered media problems ,",
    "the radiation condition imposed on the scattered field is somewhat different than that in free - space , the silver - mller condition .",
    "the proper radiation condition can be derived from an asymptotic analysis of the domain green s function@xcite .",
    "it suffices to point out that if the dielectrics are slightly absorbing , i.e. have a wavenumber @xmath37 with small imaginary part , then non - decaying surface waves are prohibited .",
    "integral equation formulations of the two previous problems on bounded domains have been updated using generalized debye source representations , which are immune from low - frequency breakdown , topological breakdown ( in multiply connected geometries ) , and spurious resonances in @xmath11@xcite .",
    "so far , we have ignored the topic of discretization .",
    "generally , it is not feasible to use the physical variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 to discretize the infinite interfaces between homogeneous dielectrics , a prohibitively large linear system would be the result .",
    "therefore , there are two main approaches to the problem : construct the domain green s function which accounts for all the boundary conditions between layers , or discretize the fourier transform of the unknowns defined on the interfaces , which will be numerically compactly supported if the original unknown is smooth .",
    "this , latter , spectral approach was introduced by sommerfeld@xcite .    in the case of the perfectly conducting half - space or bi - layer dielectric , the dyadic green s function can be readily constructed@xcite , although possibly taking on a complicated analytical or integral form . in the presence of multiple dielectric layers , no analytic closed - form solution for the green s function",
    "in fact , the true green s function corresponds to the green s function for a one - dimensional wave equation with non - constant ( piecewise - constant in our case ) coefficients@xcite . constructing an analytical approximation or",
    "a convergent numerical scheme has been the subject of countless classical electromagnetics and electrical engineering papers .",
    "it should be mentioned that one analytical solution does exist , that of scattering in layered media by pure plane waves ( transverse waves ) .",
    "the evaluation of the scattered field can be reduced to recursively calculating reflection and transmission coefficients layer by layer@xcite .",
    "this approach can handle several real - world scattering problems , but is not suitable for arbitrary incoming fields or being embedded inside simulations involving complicated geometry .",
    "for example , if the incoming field is generated by dipoles , the spectral components of the field must first be calculated in order for the method of reflection / transmission of plane waves to be applied .    on the other hand , fourier methods , commonly referred to as sommerfeld methods , are applicable in the presence of arbitrarily smooth incoming fields .",
    "these methods hinge on the fourier transform of the helmholtz green s function , which is given by : @xmath38 if @xmath29 is written in terms of it s fourier transform , and the @xmath39 integral is evaluated via contour integration@xcite , then we have the following sommerfeld formula for @xmath29 : @xmath40 in the following sections , we will denote by @xmath41 $ ] the two - dimensional fourier transform of a function @xmath36 . using this notation , @xmath42 is given by : @xmath43 \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2 }   \\frac{e^{-\\sqrt{\\xi^2+\\eta^2-k^2}|z|}}{\\sqrt{\\xi^2+\\eta^2-k^2}}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the methods described in sections  [ sec - mie ] and  [ sec - debye ] do not construct the domain green s function directly , but rather rely on sommerfeld representations of the helmholtz green s function",
    ". unfortunately , these methods result in slow numerical convergence when the incoming field is generated by a scatterer which is near an interface ( due to a slowly converging fourier transform density , similar to the one in the above formula ) .",
    "schemes that combine the benefits of green s function methods ( images ) with the rapid convergence of far - field sommerfeld contributions have been recently developed@xcite .",
    "one of the most popular tools used in numerical simulations of electromagnetic fields in layered media is the dyadic green s function .",
    "evaluations of the dyadic green s function due to hertz current dipole sources ( either in real - space or fourier - space ) oriented horizontally and vertically can be linearly combined to construct the response for arbitrarily oriented current sources@xcite .",
    "these techniques have been at the center of a large number of layered media scattering schemes , and are widely applicable in complicated geometries because of the local natural of the green s function .",
    "furthermore , they provide one possible solution to the problem of scattering from objects which are arbitrarily close to dielectric - dielectric or dielectric - perfectly conducting interfaces as the induced field singularity can be explicitly handled using an adaptive discretization scheme .",
    "however , the approach is not without its drawbacks - namely , evaluation of electric fields via convolution of the dyadic green s function with a current source becomes numerically unstable as @xmath1 .",
    "evaluation of the dyadic green s function requires differentiation followed by division by @xmath44 .",
    "the nature of this low - frequency instability is the same as that which is present in the standard representation of @xmath26 in the lorenz gauge , given in equation  ( [ eq - lorenz ] ) .",
    "unless the divergence of the electric current is handled analytically , with an _ explicit _ factoring out of @xmath0 , accuracy will be lost in the evaluation of the scalar potential term since the resulting calculation suffers from catastrophic cancellation since @xmath45 .",
    "the spectral ( sommerfeld ) form of the dyadic green s function suffers from the same form of numerical difficulties .",
    "methods which are based on so - called charge - current formulations are one attempt to circumvent this instability@xcite .    the dyadic green s function for the electric field in maxwell s equations @xcite is given by @xmath46 where a dyad @xmath47 can be viewed as either a @xmath48 matrix or a rank - two tensor , and the matrix @xmath49 has entries @xmath50 .",
    "likewise , the dyadic green s function for the magnetic field is : @xmath51 for a localized distribution of electric current @xmath7 in a homogeneous region @xmath52 , the induced electric and magnetic fields are given by @xmath53 the green s function for the perfectly conducting half - space can be constructed explicitly via images@xcite in the lower half - space , @xmath54 where the image points are given by @xmath55 .",
    "the images in the above formula annihilate the tangential components of the electric field on @xmath22 . in the presence of planar layered media , the dyadic green s function for the electric field must satisfy the variable - coefficient vector wave equation : @xmath56",
    "a solution in the fourier domain can be found to this equation using vector wave functions ( the vector version of partial wave expansions for the helmholtz equation , analogous to vector spherical harmonics ) , but the result requires several calculations and would detract from the following discussion .",
    "an expression for the dyadic green s function using discrete real - images , like those in equation  ( [ eq - pecimages ] ) does not exist .",
    "see section 7.4.2 in chew@xcite for a thorough discussion of the above .",
    "unfortunately , both the physical and the spectral representation of the dyadic green s function suffers from low - frequency breakdown ; both include division by @xmath11 or @xmath57 .",
    "note that the magnetic field dyadic green s function does _ not _ suffer from low - frequency breakdown , which is obvious from the behavior of the magnetic field integral equation as @xmath1@xcite ( however , other , topological instabilities do arise ) .",
    "the component - wise spectral representation of @xmath58 is given by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 for the sake of convenient notation .",
    "we now move onto the first of our new , stable representations of electromagnetic fields in planar geometries , an extension of the spherical lorenz - debye - mie representation .",
    "the analytical mie series solution to scattering from perfectly conducting and dielectric spheres is a classic result in mathematical physics due to mie in 1908@xcite , and then shortly thereafter rederived by debye while working on light pressure in 1909@xcite .",
    "it is the mie series solution that is often used to determine whether time - harmonic or fully time - dependent electromagnetic scattering codes are converging to the correct answer at the correct rate@xcite .    the spherical representation of such solutions is now referred to as the lorenz - mie - debye representation of time - harmonic electromagnetic waves , and is given by : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are any two scalar functions which satisfy the homogeneous helmholtz equation with parameter @xmath11 and @xmath64 is the unit vector in the radial direction .",
    "it has been shown several times@xcite that knowledge of @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( in the volume ) uniquely determines all components of @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , on a sphere , the boundary value problem @xmath67 is uniquely solvable if @xmath36 and @xmath68 are mean - zero functions@xcite .",
    "since both @xmath69 and @xmath70 satisfy the homogeneous helmholtz equation , they can be written in terms of a spherical eigenfunction expansion , leading to the mie series solution for spherical scattering using the above debye representation of the electromagnetic fields . briefly , in mie scattering one usually specifies @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( known as debye potentials ) using spherical partial wave expansions : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the spherical partial wave function of degree @xmath73 and order @xmath74 , @xmath75 with @xmath76 the order @xmath73 spherical hankel function of the first kind , and @xmath77 the spherical harmonic of degree @xmath73 and order @xmath74 , normalized so that @xmath78 . using the coefficients @xmath79 , @xmath80 of a similarly expressed incoming electromagnetic field , one can match modes depending on the boundary conditions and analytically calculate @xmath81 , @xmath82@xcite for the scattered field .",
    "the series for @xmath62 , @xmath63 can be truncated depending on the number of partial wave function needed to describe the incoming field .",
    "we now extend the above spherical representation of maxwell fields to one which is immune from low - frequency breakdown and compatible with planar geometries . in cartesian coordinates , it is easy to show uniqueness of maxwell fields which obey the silver - mller radiation condition given @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for if @xmath85 , @xmath86 , the only electromagnetic fields satisfying maxwell s equations must be of the form : @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 are unit vectors in the @xmath90 and @xmath91 directions , respectively , and @xmath92 , @xmath93 are constants . however , these fields do not decay at infinity .",
    "therefore , the coefficients @xmath92 , @xmath93 must be set to zero in order for the field to obey the silver - mller radiation condition .",
    "furthermore , if the electromagnetic fields are generated by a finite collection of current , @xmath7 , located in a volume @xmath52 , then the @xmath25-components can be calculated easily using the lorenz gauge representation of fields , as in  ( [ eq - lorenz ] ) .",
    "the resulting expression is analogous to that derived by bouwkamp and casimir@xcite for the radial components , so we omit it here . in order to extend their spherical result to the upper half - space , we change representation  ( [ eq - mierep ] ) slightly .",
    "it is clear that another valid representation of maxwell fields for @xmath18 is given by @xmath94 where the radial unit vector @xmath64 has been replaced with the unit vector in the @xmath25-direction , @xmath95 .",
    "it is easy to show a direct correspondence between @xmath62 , @xmath63 and the @xmath25-components of the electromagnetic field : @xmath96    in order to write @xmath62 , @xmath63 in terms of the driving current @xmath7 , which is now assumed to lie in a volume @xmath52 located in the lower half - space , instead of expressing @xmath62 , @xmath63 as partial wave expansions it is convenient to form them in a manner which is compatible with the planar geometry of the problem while still automatically satisfying the helmholtz equation .",
    "for some @xmath97 $ ] , @xmath98 $ ] , we assume that @xmath62 , @xmath63 are generally of the form : @xmath99 where @xmath42 is the fourier transform of the three - dimensional helmholtz green s function , given in formula  ( [ eq - som ] ) . using this representation , @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "can be thought of as a superposition of plane waves that obey the sommerfeld radiation condition for the helmholtz equation .",
    "substituting the spectral sommerfeld formula for @xmath29 into the lorenz gauge representation of @xmath27 in  ( [ eq - lorenz ] ) , we see that @xmath100 this formula can be interpreted as constructing @xmath27 from a superposition of attenuated transverse two - dimensional fourier transforms of the current @xmath7 .",
    "the normal component @xmath101 is then given by @xmath102 e^{-i(\\xi x ' + \\eta y ' ) } \\ ,   dv ' \\right ) e^{i(\\xi x + \\eta y ) }   \\ , d\\xi d\\eta.\\ ] ] similarly , an expression for @xmath26 can be derived .",
    "we only provide the formula for @xmath103 , and not the derivation : @xmath104 \\ , e^{-i(\\xi x ' + \\eta y ' ) } \\ , dv ' \\right ) \\ ,",
