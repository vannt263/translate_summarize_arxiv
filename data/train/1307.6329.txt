    "<S> several scenarios for realization of edge majorana modes in quantum chain systems : spin chains , chains of josephson junctions , and chains of coupled cavities in quantum optics , are considered . </S>",
    "<S> for all these systems excitations can be presented as superpositions of a spinless fermion and a hole , characteristic for majorana fermion . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the features of our exact solution with respect to possible experiments , in which edge majorana fermions can be directly observed when studying magnetic , superconducting , and optical characteristics of such systems .    </S>",

    "<S> . they may appear as elementary neutral particles , or emerge as quasiparticles in many - body systems @xcite . during last years mf , besides being of fundamental interest of their own , have attracted great attention as the basis for potential application in topological quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the search for mf is among the most prominent tasks for modern physicists . during last few years </S>",
    "<S> a great progress has been achieved in such a search in condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , we can not expect mf to exist in ordinary metals , because excitations , electrons , considered as quasiparticles there , and their counterparts , holes ( which linear combination would correspond to the mf ) , can destruct each other : they carry opposite charges . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the search in different , non - standard systems of fermions with special properties , where mf can exist as emergent non - trivial excitations , is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> superconducting systems seemingly provide a basis for such states , because elementary excitations there are superpositions of electrons and holes . </S>",
    "<S> however , for conventional superconductors with , e.g. , @xmath0-wave pairing , those superpositions of electrons and holes carrying _ opposite _ spin are different from majorana s construction . </S>",
    "<S> then it follows that for a system of spinless fermions with pairing , like e.g. , model superconductors with @xmath1-pairing in one dimensional ( 1d ) systems @xcite , or with @xmath2-pairing in 2d ones @xcite , mf can emerge . among the most known predicted candidates for mf existence </S>",
    "<S> are topological insulators @xcite , and semiconducting quantum wires @xcite , where pairing can be achieved by interfacing them with an ordinary superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the modern `` state of art '' of theoretical predictions for realizations of such systems has been recently reviewed , e.g. , in @xcite . while recent papers @xcite claim that they have observed zero bias anomalies in the tunneling conductance of normal conducting and superconducting systems , which can be explained by the presence of zero energy mf , very recent publications mention that in those experiments the spatial resolution could be not enough to detect mf , and that disorder can result in zero bias features @xcite even for non - topological system ( where mf are absent ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is why , proposals for realization of direct observations of mf are highly desirable .    in the present work we consider several scenarios for the _ direct _ observation of edge mf in quantum chains , which can be realized in quantum magnetic , superconducting , and optical systems . for all these systems excitations can be presented as superpositions of spinless fermions and holes , the hallmark of mf . </S>",
    "<S> we choose 1d systems , because exact theoretical results can be obtained there , which is very important for comparison with experiment , and due to the significant success in fabrication and manipulation of quasi-1d materials in recent years . </S>",

    "<S> worth noting that luttinger liquid approach can not in principle describe localized states , which affect the behavior of edge mf ; however , it can describe the low-@xmath10 behavior , determined by extended states of the chain . for the chain of josephson junctions </S>",
    "<S> such a characteristic can be observed when studying the charge of the edge island as a function of the voltage , applied locally to the edge of the chain @xcite , and temperature , or the tunneling andreev conductance . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in quantum optics the edge mf can be detected by measuring the state of the probe cavity ( or the edge cavity ) as a function of the tunneling amplitude @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect similar effects for the edge mf on the opposite side of the finite chain . </S>",
    "<S> for the extended states of the latter one can replace @xmath115 with integer @xmath116 .    in summary , we have proposed the way of direct observation of the edge mf in several realizations in quantum chains , where excitations can be presented as superpositions of spinless fermions and holes , the necessary condition for mf : in `` easy - plane '' spin-1/2 chains with in - plane polarized magnetic field , applied to the edge of the chain ; in the chain of josephson junctions , and in the chain of cavities in quantum optics with the tunneling of photons to the edge cavity . as we have shown , such an edge mf can be observed at nonzero temperatures in experiments on dc or ac josephson currents in chains of superconducting islands , nonlinear quantum optics , and quantum spin chain materials , as the local characteristic of the edge under the action of the governing parameter , @xmath10 , which _ directly _ affects the edge mf .    </S>",
