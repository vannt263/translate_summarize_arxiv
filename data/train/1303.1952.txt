    "delay - tolerant networks  ( dtns )  @xcite ,  @xcite are challenged networks where end - to - end connectivity does not always exist between nodes .",
    "one reason this may occur is that links get disrupted either due to interference or due to nodes moving out of range of each other .",
    "dtns can be put to a variety of applications such as bringing internet connectivity to villages , and reducing the pressure on cellular bandwidth by offloading delivery through wifi and mobiles of people moving in the vicinity .",
    "since an end - to - end path seldom exists between source and destination , most existing internet protocols fail and instead , the store - carry - forward  @xcite protocol is used to transfer messages from source to destination through a number of intermediate relays .",
    "the lack of an end - to - end path means message delivery delays are large .",
    "hence , lowering the message delivery delays would be critical in enhancing the performance of most of these applications .",
    "it has been shown that contention adversely affects the delay performance of dtns  @xcite .",
    "this is because contention implies that transfer of a message is not always possible when one node meets another , owing to two of the following reasons :  @xmath0  the message contends with other messages in the buffer of the node to be chosen for transmission , and  @xmath1  the node contends with other nodes in the vicinity for opportunities to communicate .",
    "while contention has been recognized as an important factor that increases delivery delays , the problem of fighting contention and thereby reducing delivery delays in dtns has not been adequately considered . for a lot of dtn application scenarios , it is possible for a number of nodes to come in the vicinity of each other .",
    "for example , people in a crowded public square , or villagers near a road where a vehicle is passing by . in these scenarios , as a result of contention , most nodes would not be able to transmit the messages they carry since existing access schemes such as carrier sense multiple access  ( csma ) are one - to - one communication schemes and would allow only one pair of nodes within the region of contention to communicate at any instant of time .",
    "many - to - many  ( m2 m ) communication  @xcite ,  @xcite has been proposed to improve the capacity of mobile ad hoc networks  ( manets ) and enables each node in a bounded group of nodes to simultaneously communicate with each other node in the group .",
    "hence when a number of nodes come in the vicinity of each other , this precious contact duration is used much better , with more nodes getting a chance to communicate .",
    "hence , m2 m communication can be used to battle the effects of contention and therefore reduce message delivery delays .",
    "m2 m communication has become feasible since the state - of - the - art technology enables support for both access schemes ( such as code division multiple access  ( cdma ) ) and location services such as global positioning system  ( gps ) ) on a single ic chip  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analytically model the expected delivery delay of a dtn employing epidemic routing and m2 m communication . despite the fact that the analysis has been done for epidemic routing ,",
    "the framework we develop is easily extended to other routing protocols .",
    "the accuracy of our model is demonstrated by matching the results from analysis against those from simulations .",
    "also , simulations show that for high - contention scenarios , m2 m communication significantly outperforms one - to - one communication employing csma in terms of delivery delay .",
    "initial analytical models developed for dtn routing performance study  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite worked under the assumption that whenever two nodes are in contact with each other , all messages could always be successfully transferred from one node to the other  ( @xmath2  they assumed both buffer capacity and bandwidth to be infinite ) . while papers such as  @xcite have modeled dtn performance with bounded buffer capacity , they have assumed that infinite bandwidth is available and hence that there is no contention .",
    "the motivation for not considering contention has been that dtns are sparse networks and such sparsity yields negligible contention .",
    "however , this conjecture has been disproved with the help of simulations in works such as  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the authors in  @xcite show via simulations that , irrespective of whether the network is sparse or dense , the contention is substantial for high traffic rates ; and also that the contention increases with an increase in network density . realizing the importance of contention in the routing performance , the authors have attempted to include contention in the analysis of routing  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "their analysis assumes the one - to - one csma communication scheme .    in our paper",
    ", however , we propose that in scenarios where there are areas of high node density ( _ i.e. , _  a number of nodes in the vicinity of each other ) , nodes must co - operate using an m2 m communication scheme such as the one proposed in  @xcite and not compete as assumed by  @xcite .",
    "this would mean that instead of just one pair of nodes in such an area of higher node density communicating , we can have a larger set of nodes communicating with each other at the same time .",
    "this would significantly increase the probability that two nodes which come into contact with each other get to exchange messages , and thereby reduce the routing delay .",
    "the beneficial effect of using such an m2 m communication scheme would be amplified in the presence of high traffic loads .",
    "in this section , we develop an analytical model for the expected delivery delay of a dtn employing m2 m communication .",
    "we follow the delivery of a particular message from source node to the destination node , and model the evolution of the state of the system with respect to this message .",
    "we first describe the medium access control  ( mac ) protocol used for achieving m2 m communication which logically divides the network into square cells ( or ) tiles .",
    "we then derive the mobility statistics for the random direction  ( rd ) mobility model , where the network is logically divided into square tiles as described in the mac protocol . using these statistics , we model the evolution of the network as a stochastic process and",
    "thereby derive the expected delivery delay .",
    "we adopt the scheme proposed by moraes et .",
    "al . , in  @xcite for m2 m communication in manets .",
    "while they have proposed this scheme to increase the capacity of manets , we adopt the scheme to reduce delivery delays in dtns . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we briefly describe the scheme in this section . the network is logically divided into a number of square tiles .",
    "each node , with the help of gps , is aware of its current location ( thereby the current tile it is in ) .",
    "gps also helps in time synchronization among the nodes .",
    "therefore , the communication in each tile is synchronized . in each tile",
    ", communication is performed in the form of sessions that have two phases .",
    "the first phase , called the discovery phase , is divided into slots .",
    "each node in the grid that wants to communicate randomly picks one slot and broadcasts its presence to the other nodes in that slot , along with some other control plane information . the first bunch of nodes  ( say @xmath3-nodes ) that successfully do so enter the second phase , which is the communication phase .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is chosen according to different factors such as the allowable receiver complexity .",
    "we assume there are sufficient slots to make the probability of collision negligible thereby ensuring that if there are lesser than @xmath3 nodes in a particular cell , then all of them are chosen for communication with a high probability .",
    "also , this means that when there are at least @xmath3 nodes in a particular cell , the mac scheme effectively chooses a random subset of @xmath3-nodes from the set of nodes in that cell .",
    "each node that enters the communication phase is assigned a code on which it transmits data and a frequency on which it receives data .",
    "using narrowband fdma / cdma , all @xmath3 nodes are able to communicate with each other simultaneously ( @xmath2  each node participating in the communication session can send up to @xmath4 messages to every other node participating in the session , where @xmath4 depends on the bandwidth available for m2 m communication ) .    @xmath5    ( 1,0)510        the imt of any two nodes is defined as the time elapsed between two successive meetings of the nodes .",
    "since we logically tile the terrain to make the mac easier , the imt is expected to increase since some communication opportunities are lost as a result of tiling the terrain .",
    "hence existing derivations  @xcite do not hold as such .",
    "we adopt the methodology used in  @xcite to derive the distribution of the imt , show it to be exponential and derive its mean .",
    "we define the area covered by a node while moving along a path as the total area that came under the node s coverage when it moved along that path . it must be noted that a node s coverage area at any point is the cell it is in at that point .",
    "the average area @xmath6 covered during an epoch    under rd mobility over a square - tiled terrain is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the length of a side of a cell , and @xmath9 is the average distance covered in an epoch of the rd model .",
    "consider a node starting an epoch within a cell at the coordinate @xmath10 as illustrated in fig  [ rdmotion ] .",
    "since the rd model has a uniform stationary distribution , these coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 are drawn from a uniform distribution over @xmath13 $ ] . also , according to the rd model , the node chooses an angle @xmath14 drawn from a uniform distribution over @xmath15 $ ] , velocity @xmath16 drawn from a uniform distribution over @xmath17 $ ] , duration of epoch @xmath18 drawn from an exponential distribution with average @xmath19 , and a halting time at the end of the epoch drawn from a uniform distribution with average @xmath20 .",
    "let the number of vertical walls and horizontal walls crossed during this epoch be @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "we have for @xmath23 $ ] ,    @xmath24    and @xmath25    we now derive the area covered in the epoch , by counting the number of cells that are traversed in that epoch . for most starting configurations",
    ", the node does not pass through corner - points of cells during the epoch .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to assume that every wall crossed during the epoch is intersected somewhere along the side and therefore that each intersection represents crossover of the node into a new cell .",
    "hence the number of cells @xmath26 covered in the epoch for @xmath27 $ ] is given by ,    @xmath28    because of symmetry , the average number of cells covered in an epoch for @xmath27 $ ] is the same as the average for @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "hence , the average number of cells @xmath30 covered in an epoch is given by  eq .",
    "[ lengthyeqtn ] , which on solving gives , @xmath31 hence we have @xmath32    having estimated the average area covered during each epoch , we can proceed as in  @xcite to show that the expected hitting time @xmath33 is as follows :    @xmath34    in a similar way , as done in  @xcite , we can show that the meeting time @xmath35 is exponentially distributed with an average given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant  ( @xmath38 ) for the rd model such that the expected relative speed between two nodes @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the probability that a node is moving at any point in time given by , @xmath42 finally we can show that the intermeeting time is also approximately exponentially distributed such that its average @xmath43 equals @xmath35 .",
    "the contact time between two nodes is defined as the time elapsed between when the two nodes come within communication range of each other and when they go out of the communication range of each other . in this section",
    ", we derive the expression for the expected contact time ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we assume that the probability of contact between two nodes lasting over multiple cells is negligible .",
    "when a contact occurs , two cases arise : either one node could be stationary or both nodes could be moving .",
    "let the expected contact time in the first case be @xmath45 and in the second case be @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47    the probability that both nodes are moving given that one node is moving is @xmath41 and the probability that one node is stationary given that one node is moving is @xmath48 .",
    "the result follows from this .    @xmath49    where @xmath50\\ ] ] and @xmath51\\ ] ] for @xmath52 given by @xmath53    when one node is stationary , the contact begins when the other node enters the cell and ends when the other node leaves ( our assumption that contacts last only over a cell is especially valid in this case ) .",
    "hence the expected contact time in this case @xmath45 is given by the expected time elapsed between the moving node entering and leaving the cell .",
    "we assume the moving node enters through any particular wall of the cell ( since the problem is symmetric w.r.t the different walls of the cell ) with a uniform distribution on point of entry , velocity , and angle of entry .",
    "since epoch lengths are assumed large , it is assumed that with high probability , the movement of the node through the cell is part of one epoch and hence a straight line .",
    "the node can leave either through one of the two adjacent walls or the opposite wall .",
    "@xmath54 is the product of the expected time taken to leave through a particular adjacent wall with the probability that the node leaves through that adjacent wall .",
    "similarly , @xmath55 is the product of the expected time taken to leave through the opposite wall with the probability that the node leaves through the opposite wall .",
    "hence , @xmath56",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 can be derived using geometric arguments which we do not present here due to space constraints .",
    "now we approximate the contact time distribution with one node stationary as an exponential distribution with expected value @xmath45 .",
    "hence the contact time for both nodes moving is given by the minimum of the times spent by each node in the cell and is hence approximately exponential with expected value @xmath57 .",
    "in this section we develop a framework for modeling contention in a dtn employing m2 m communication .",
    "we first derive the distribution for the number of neighbors of any node and then derive the expected number of messages in the buffer of a node .",
    "these results are then used to develop the contention model .",
    "we have established that the imt and ct are approximately exponential with means @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "we hence model the process of nodes arriving within communication range of a particular node ( @xmath2  entering the same cell as the node ) , and moving out of communication range of the node as a discrete time markov chain , where the states are given by the number of neighbors at the beginning of each communication session .",
    "we assume that the probability of having more than @xmath59 neighbors is negligible .",
    "we also assume that since the duration of a communication session  ( @xmath60 ) is small , the probability of more than one arrival or departure in the duration of a communication session is negligible .",

    "we assume in the subsequent sections that the probability that the number of neighbors @xmath69 equals @xmath70 is denoted by @xmath71 .      in order to derive the expression for the expected number of messages in buffer ( @xmath72 $ ] )",

    "we first derive the expression for the arrival rate @xmath74 .",
    "we then derive @xmath75 $ ] in the next section .",
    "@xmath74 is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the rate of generation of messages at that node and @xmath78 is the rate at which relay messages ( messages for which this node is going to act as relay ) arrive at the node . to calculate @xmath78 , we assume that any given message spreads to nearly the entire network before being removed by the recovery mechanism . this is valid for the direct recovery mechanism we assume is used , which makes minimal effort at recovery .",
    "hence , we assume that any message in the network is replicated at a node with a high probability before all its copies are erased from the network .",
    "now , working under this assumption , we treat the network as a queue with messages generated at other nodes considered as arrivals ( with an average rate @xmath79 ) , and messages delivered to a particular node under consideration as service completions ( with an average rate @xmath78 ) .",
    "clearly , for the number of messages in the network to be stable , the service rate @xmath78 must be at least @xmath79 ) .",
    "we approximate the value of @xmath78 by this lower bound .",
    "the expected waiting time depends on several factors such as the chosen mobility model , routing protocol , and the recovery mechanism . in order to derive the expected waiting time for epidemic routing ,",
    "we assume direct recovery is used , @xmath2  a node will only drop a message after meeting the destination and either transmitting the message to the destination itself or learning from the destination node that the destination node has already received the message .",
    "we also assume that the scheduler at each node works such that whenever the destination of some messages is encountered , those messages are given top priority .",
    "we also assume that if contact is established with the destination of some messages in the buffer , the bandwidth available is sufficient to transmit all the messages to the destination .",
    "this is valid since we assume symmetric traffic generation , @xmath80  for any source node , there is an equal amount of traffic generated destined for every other node and hence a limited amount of traffic destined for any particular destination . under these assumptions we consider a particular message in the buffer of a particular node (",
    "call it the current node ) and derive its expected waiting time for epidemic routing .",
    "let @xmath81 be the probability of successfully communicating with the destination of the message given that the current node meets the destination  ( successful communication may not happen because of contention with other neighboring nodes ) .",
    "the number of meetings with the destination before the current node is successfully able to communicate with it is geometrically distributed with mean @xmath82 and the average time elapsed between meetings is @xmath43 .",

    "@xmath86 is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the probability that a particular node gets to communicate in a session given that it has @xmath70 neighbors .",
    "@xmath88 depends upon the mac protocol used to resolve contention . as described in section",
    "[ sec : macprotocol ] , the mac protocol effectively chooses all nodes in a cell if the number of nodes is atmost @xmath3 , else it chooses a random @xmath3-sized subset of the nodes in the cell .",

    "figure  [ delayperformance ] compares the routing delay values obtained from analysis and simulations for @xmath153 and @xmath154 nodes , and for two different link bandwidths , namely @xmath155  kbps and @xmath156  kbps . for each configuration , the comparison is done over average node speeds  ( @xmath157 ) ranging from @xmath158  m / sec to @xmath159  m / sec .",
    "these delay values were observed in the stability region of the experiments and the delivery ratios ( @xmath2  the fraction of messages delivered successfully ) were observed to be close to @xmath160 .",
    "while we have made a number of approximations in developing our analytical model , we find that the delay values from analysis and simulations match , thereby validating our model and showing that the approximations were reasonable ones to make .",
    "as is expected , it is observed that with an increase in node speeds the routing delay decreases , as the mixing of nodes enable faster delivery of messages .",
    "moreover , an approximately three - fold increase in the link bandwidth proportionally reduces the routing delay , which is intuitive as messages are pumped three times faster for the same contact time scenarios .",
    "figure  [ 100stability ] compares the routing performance of one - to - one csma and m2 m schemes .",
    "these experiments were run with a lower link bandwidth of @xmath153  kbps for m2 m and @xmath161  kbps for one - to - one csma .",
    "csma is given a higher bandwidth since it uses the entire spectrum available while m2 m communication divides the spectrum among the @xmath3 ( @xmath162 ) nodes participating in a communication session using fdma .",
    "the m2 m scheme clearly outperforms the one - to - one csma scheme .",
    "we find that when the m2 m scheme reaches its stability region , the csma scheme has not yet attained stability , and the differences between the two schemes are increasing with time .",
    "the fact that m2 m has reached its stability region while csma has not , is supported by the high delivery ratio values  ( @xmath2  above @xmath160 ) for m2 m and lower delivery ratio values  ( @xmath2  around @xmath163 ) for csma .",
    "also our m2 m delay values stabilize near the corresponding analytical delay values .",
    "in this paper , we have shown for the first time how m2 m communication can be used to combat contention , and thereby reduce the routing delay in a dtn .",
    "a theoretical model has been developed for the delivery delay of a dtn employing epidemic routing and m2 m communication and has been validated against simulations . using simulations ,",
    "we have also shown that m2 m communication significantly outperforms communication that uses one - to - one csma in terms of delivery delay . in the future",
    ", we plan to extend the model developed to work with more sophisticated mobility models .",
