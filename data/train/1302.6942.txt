    "the standard model ( sm ) , based on the local gauge symmetry @xmath4 , is very successful in describing all the experimental results below the tev scale .",
    "it is an excellent effective field theory , but it is widely believed not to be the final theory .",
    "discovery of new particles is highly anticipated at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the most likely and reasonably well motivated candidates are supersymmetric particles , and extra @xmath5 boson .",
    "however , it is important to explore other alternatives or entirely new possibilities at the current and future lhc .    in the sm",
    ", we have fermions ( spin 1/2 ) and scalars ( higgs fields)(spin 0 ) which do not belong to adjoint representations under the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "can we also have tev scale gauge bosons ( spin 1 ) belonging to the non - adjoint representations under the sm gauge symmetry",
    "? can we achieve the ( partial ) grand unified theory at the tev scale ?",
    "can we construct a renormalizable theory realizing such a possibility which can be tested at the lhc ?",
    "these are very interesting theoretical questions that we shall address in this work .",
    "discovery of such gauge bosons around the tev scale at the lhc will open up a new window for our understanding of the fundamental theory describing the nature .    how can we construct a consistent theory involving the massive vector bosons which do not belong to the adjoint representations under the sm gauge symmetry ? if the massive vector bosons are not the gauge bosons of a symmetry group , there are some theoretical problems from the consistency of quantum field theory , for instance , the unitarity and renormalizability  @xcite . when the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken via the higgs mechanism , the interactions of the massive gauge bosons satisfy both the unitarity and the renormalizability of the theory  @xcite .",
    "thus , the massive vector bosons must be the gauge bosons arising from spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "as we know , a lot of models with extra tev scale gauge bosons have been proposed previously in the literature .",
    "however , those massive gauge bosons either belong to the adjoint representations or are singlets under the sm gauge symmetry  @xcite . for example , in the top color model  @xcite , the colorons belong to the adjoint representation of the @xmath6 ; in the top flavor model  @xcite , the extra @xmath7 and @xmath5 bosons belong to the adjoint representation of the @xmath8 , while in the @xmath9 model  @xcite or top hypercharge model  @xcite , the new @xmath5 boson is a singlet under the sm gauge symmetry . in the grand unified theories such as @xmath0 and @xmath10  @xcite , there are such kind of massive gauge bosons .",
    "however , their masses have to be around the unification scale @xmath11 gev to satisfy the proton decay constraints .",
    "some years ago , two of us ( tl and sn ) had proposed a class of models where the gauge symmetry is @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the quantum numbers of the sm fermions and higgs fields under the @xmath13 gauge symmetry are the same as they have under the sm gauge symmetry @xmath14 , while they are all singlets under @xmath15 .",
    "hence @xmath15 is the hidden gauge symmetry . after the gauge symmetry @xmath16",
    "is spontaneously broken down to the sm gauge symmetry at the tev scale via higgs mechanism , some of the massive gauge bosons from the @xmath16 breaking do not belong to the adjoint representations under the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "in particular , a concrete @xmath17 has been studied in detail .",
    "however , the corresponding @xmath18 massive gauge bosons are meta - stable and behave like the stable heavy quarks and anti - quarks at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "thus , an interesting question is whether we can construct the @xmath17 models where the @xmath18 gauge bosons can decay and produce interesting signals at the lhc . by the way",
    ", the six - dimensional orbifold non - supersymmetric and supersymmetric @xmath0 and @xmath19 models with low energy gauge unification have been constructed previously  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no direct interactions between the @xmath18 particles and the sm fermions .",
    "as we pointed out above , the top color model  @xcite , top flavor model  @xcite , and top hypercharge model  @xcite have been constructed before .",
    "because of the proton decay problem and quark ckm mixings , etc , the real challenging question is whether we can construct the top @xmath0 model as the unification of these models .",
    "consequently , we can explain the charge quantization for the third family , and probe the baryon and lepton number violating interactions involving the third family at the lhc .",
    "such a model was proposed by us recently @xcite , and its implications for lhc was briefly explored .    in this paper , we shall propose two such models : the minimal and the renormalizable top @xmath0 model where the @xmath1 gauge symmetry is broken down to the sm gauge symmetry via the bifundamental higgs fields at low energy .",
    "the first two families of the sm fermions are charged under @xmath2 while the third family is charged under @xmath0 . in the minimal top @xmath0 model , we show that the quark ckm mixing matrix can be generated via dimension - five operators , and the proton decay problem can be solved by fine - tuning the coefficients of the higher dimensional operators at the order of @xmath3 . in the renormalizable top @xmath0 model , we can explain the quark ckm mixing matrix by introducing vector - like particles , and we do not have proton decay problem .",
    "in these models , the non - unification of the three sm couplings are remedied , because three sm couplings @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are now combinations of @xmath23 , @xmath24,@xmath25 , and need not be unified . since the models have baryon and lepton number violating interactions , it might be useful in generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe . in our models , since the third family quark lepton unification is at the tev scale , we can probe the new @xmath26 gauge bosons at the lhc through their decays to the third family of the sm fermions .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the two models and their formalism . in section iii , we discuss in detail the phenomenological implications of the models .",
    "these include the productions and decays of the x and y gauge bosons at the lhc energies of 7 , 8 and 14 tev , their decay modes , and the signals for the final states .",
    "we also discuss the lhc reach for the masses of these particle for various lhc energies and luminosities .",
    "section iv contains our summary and conclusions .",
    "we propose two non - supersymmetric top @xmath0 models where the gauge symmetry is @xmath27 .",
    "the first two families of the sm fermions are charged under @xmath2 while the third family is charged under @xmath0 .",
    "we denote the gauge fields for @xmath0 and @xmath28 as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , and the gauge couplings for @xmath0 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the lie algebra indices for the generators of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are denoted by @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , and the lie algebra indices for the generators of @xmath44 are denoted by @xmath45 . after the @xmath46 gauge symmetry is broken down to the sm gauge symmetry @xmath47 , we denote the massless gauge fields for the sm gauge symmetry as @xmath48 , and the massive gauge fields as @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the gauge couplings for the sm gauge symmetry @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath51 are @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath52 , respectively .    to break the @xmath46 gauge symmetry down to the sm gauge symmetry , we introduce two bifundamental higgs fields @xmath53 and @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "let us explain our convention .",
    "we denote the first two family quark doublets , right - handed up - type quarks , right - handed down - type quarks , lepton doublets , right - handed neutrinos , right - handed charged leptons , and the corresponding higgs field respectively as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , as in the supersymmetric sm convention .",
    "we denote the third family sm fermions as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . to give the masses to the third family of the sm fermions ,",
    "we introduce a @xmath0 anti - fundamental higgs field @xmath65 .",
    "we also need to introduce a scalar field @xmath66 if we require that the triplet higgs @xmath67 have mass around the @xmath1 gauge symmetry breaking scale . however , it is not necessary , and we will explain it in the following .",
    "in addition , note that the neutrino pmns mixings can be generated via the right - handed neutrino majorana mass mixings .",
    "we propose two top @xmath0 models which can generate the mass for the possible pseudo - nambu - goldston boson ( pngb ) @xmath68 during the gauge symmetry breaking and generate the quark ckm mixings . in the minimal top @xmath0 model",
    ", we consider the dimension - five non - renormalizable operators and fine - tune some coefficients of the higher dimensional operators at the order @xmath3 to suppress the proton decay . in the renormalizable top @xmath0 model",
    ", we introduce the additional vector - like particles . to give the pngb mass",
    ", we introduce a scalar field @xmath69 in the @xmath0 anti - symmetric representation . and to generate the quark ckm mixings while not to introduce the proton decay problem , we introduce the vector - like fermionic particles @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "note that the @xmath28 gauge symmetry can be formally embedded into a global @xmath72 symmetry , and to do that , we introduce the vector - like particles @xmath73 as well .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ tab : cross sections ] , we have calculated the sm background for the different final states that we have considered for the signal coming form the pair productions of the @xmath76 and @xmath77 gauge bosons .",
    "the cross sections shown in table [ tab : cross sections ] are obtained after passing the events through the kinematic selection conditions given in table [ tab : cuts ] . in most cases",
    "the sm backgrounds are quite small and would remain negligible even with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath78 . note that as the top reconstruction would require sufficient events after it has decayed , we need much larger cross sections for the final states involving top quarks .",
    "to use eq.([eq : conflev ] ) , we require the background events to be sufficiently large such that the fluctuations to a gaussian distribution could be applied . we find that the best reaches are obtained for the @xmath79 and @xmath80 final states . for the @xmath81 final state at lhc with @xmath82 tev , the signal cross section for a @xmath83 sensitivity must be greater than @xmath84 for an integrated luminosity of @xmath85 respectively .",
    "this corresponds to the mass reach of @xmath86 gev respectively . with the higher center of mass energy option for lhc with @xmath87 tev , the signal cross section for a @xmath83 sensitivity must be greater than @xmath88 for an integrated luminosity of @xmath89 respectively .",
    "these lead to a mass reach of @xmath90 gev respectively . for the other channels involving the top quark in the final state",
    ", we assume the reconstruction efficiency for the top quark @xmath91 which includes the event loss from kinematic cuts after the top decays . adding the contributions for @xmath92 and @xmath80 we find that at the 8 tev run of lhc , the mass reach is @xmath93 gev for an integrated luminosity of @xmath94 respectively while at the 14 tev run of lhc , where we use the high luminosity options of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the @xmath83 sensitivity comes out to be about @xmath97 gev and @xmath98 gev respectively .",
    "although the standard model , based on local gauge symmetries , accidentally conserve baryon and lepton numbers , there is no fundamental reason for the baryon and lepton numbers to be exact symmetries of nature .",
    "in fact , grand unification , unifying quarks and leptons , naturally violate baryon and lepton number .",
    "the remarkable stability of the proton dictate that the masses of these leptoquark and diquark gauge bosons to be at the @xmath99 gev scale .",
    "however , baryon and lepton number violating interaction involving only the 3rd family of fermions is not much constrained experimentally .",
    "inspired by the topcolor , topflavor and top hypercharge models , we have a top - gut model where only the third family of fermions are unified in an @xmath0 with the symmetry breaking scale at the tev .",
    "these models give baryon and lepton number violating gauge interactions which involve only the third family , and with interesting resonant signals at the lhc .",
    "we have proposed two models , the minimal and renormalizable top @xmath0 where the @xmath1 gauge symmetry is broken down to the standard model ( sm ) gauge symmetry via the bifundamental higgs fields at low energy .",
    "the first two families of the sm fermions are charged under @xmath2 while the third family is charged under @xmath0 . in the minimal top @xmath0 model",
    ", we showed that the quark ckm mixing matrix can be generated via dimension - five operators , and the proton decay problem can be solved by fine - tuning the coefficients of the high - dimensional operators at the order of @xmath3 . in the renormalizable top @xmath0 model",
    ", we introduced additional vector - like fermions whose renormalizable interactions with the sm particles generate these dimension 5 interactions and we can explain the quark ckm mixing matrix by introducing the vector - like particles , and also there is no proton decay problem .",
    "we have discussed the phenomenology of the models in details looking for the resonant signals for the baryon and lepton number violating leptoquark as well as diquark gauge bosons at the lhc , as well as the various final state arising from the productions and decays of these heavy gauge bosons .",
    "we have also calculated the corresponding sm backgrounds .",
