    "the scenario of tev - scale gravity with large extra dimensions @xcite is currently being tested experimentally at the lhc @xcite . in this class of higher - dimensional gravity theories",
    "the planck mass can be of the order of a tev , provided that the number of extra dimensions is greater than two .",
    "if so , the lhc will probe ultra - planckian physics where gravity not only is the dominant force @xcite , but in addition it is believed to be adequately described by the classical einstein equations @xcite .",
    "this , presumably , allows one to make reliable theoretical predictions of gravitational effects without entering into the complications related to quantum gravity .",
    "one such prediction , namely the possibility of black hole formation at the lhc was extensively discussed in the literature during the past ten years @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the study of gravitational bremsstrahlung in ultra - planckian particle collisions . in ultra - planckian collisions with impact parameters smaller than the schwarzschild radius of the center of mass energy of the colliding particles ,",
    "the creation of a black hole is a dominant process and is accompanied by radiation losses at the level of 10 - 40% depending on the number of extra dimensions ( see @xcite generalizing earlier calculations by death and payne @xcite ) . on the other hand , for impact parameters larger than the gravitational radius , the black hole formation process is exponentially suppressed and the gravitational bremsstrahlung becomes the dominant inelastic classical effect , which furthermore can be very strong due to the huge number of light kaluza - klein states in the graviton spectrum .",
    "it is worth noting , that gravitational radiation may not be maximal in head - on collisions .",
    "for instance , radiation from point particles falling into the black hole is _ minimal _ for radial infall and grows initially with the impact parameter , a fact which is well known both in four - dimensional general relativity and in models with extra dimensions .",
    "the way this is understood is the following : ultra - relativistic particles hitting with some critical impact parameter can be captured into quasi - circular orbits before they plunge into the hole . during these revolutions they radiate with almost constant rate and",
    "lose energy more efficiently than during a radial infall .",
    "a large number of papers from various groups is devoted to the study of gravitational bremsstrahlung in a variety of physical set - ups and using different approaches .",
    "a rather incomplete list includes the following : a classical calculation relevant to zero and small impact parameter using the colliding wave picture was suggested long ago by death @xcite .",
    "more recently this approach was extended to the extradimensional theories @xcite .",
    "the approach of smarr et al . in @xcite",
    "was based on the low frequency approximation for the amplitude to estimate the full energy loss .",
    "matzner and nutku proposed the use of the method of virtual gravitons @xcite in analogy with the weizscker - williams approach in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "another approach consists in considering radiation in the linearized theory from particles falling towards a black hole @xcite .",
    "gravitational bremsstrahlung was also studied in the born approximation of quantum gravity ( in four dimensions ) @xcite , while the relationship between the born approximation and the post - linear formalism was discussed in @xcite .",
    "more recently , a novel approach , making use of perturbative quantum gravity to derive effective equations of motion and to describe gravitational radiation using those , was proposed under the name of `` effective theory '' approach in @xcite .",
    "estimates of radiation losses in the eikonal approximation of ( multidimensional ) quantum gravity were given in @xcite , while amati , ciafaloni and veneziano in a series of papers @xcite have considered the problem of radiation in ultra - high energy collisions of massless particles in the context of quantum string theory .",
    "estimates of the gravitational bremsstrahlung in high energy collisions in the add model were given in @xcite .",
    "finally , a lot of numerical work has also been devoted to this subject @xcite .    in four - dimensional theories , in particular , gravitational bremsstrahlung in small - angle ultrarelativistic scattering of point particles was calculated long ago , most notably by kovacs and thorne @xcite , in the framework of the so - called `` fast motion approximation '' scheme , first proposed by bertotti , havas and goldberg @xcite . a similar independent calculation , using momentum space perturbation theory up to second order in the gravitational constant , was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite leading to essentially the same results",
    ". the latter approach amounts to performing a perturbation expansion of the metric around the minkowski background up to second order in the gravitational constant and is applicable for arbitrary mass - ratios of the colliding particles . in the case of one mass @xmath10 much larger than the other @xmath11 ,",
    "the same result had been obtained earlier by peters , also using a linear approximation but around the schwarzschild background of the heavy mass @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study gravitational radiation losses in the case of ultra - relativistic collisions with large impact parameters , for which the scattering angle is small and calculations can be performed reliably within the post - linear approximation scheme of general relativity .",
    "this paper continues a series of investigations @xcite devoted to bremsstrahlung in flat space - time arising under non - gravitational scattering of charged particles @xcite and scalar radiation in gravity - mediated particle collisions @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the problem of gravitational radiation in collisions of _ massive _ point particles interacting gravitationally .",
    "the computation is purely classical and iterative and , as such , it can only be reliable within a certain domain of validity in the space of parameters .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , it turns out that , for parameter values within the region of validity of the classical approximation the _ radiation efficiency _ , i.e. the fraction of the initial energy which is radiated away , is substantially enhanced compared to the four - dimensional case , contrary to earlier qualitative estimates @xcite . moreover , for a number of extra dimensions greater than two , this quantity grows with a dimension - dependent power of the lorentz - factor @xmath12 of the collision .",
    "specifically , for the leading order radiation efficiency in the laboratory frame we obtain ( up to a dimension - dependent numerical coefficient , which however can be quite large , and an inessential @xmath13 factor for @xmath8 extra dimensions ) given erroneously for all dimensions in @xcite .",
    "the difference is due to an error in @xcite , related to the extent of the phenomenon of destructive interference discussed in the text .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative conclusions of @xcite are still correct and will be discussed further in section 5 of the present paper . ]",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath2 is the impact parameter of the collision , @xmath1 is the schwarzschild radius for the center - of - mass collision energy @xmath16^ { \\frac{1}{d+1}}\\left(\\frac{g_d   \\sqrt{s}}{c^4}\\right)^{\\frac1{d+1}}\\!\\!,\\ ] ] and",
    "@xmath17 is the initial energy in the lab frame . for collisions of two equal mass particles",
    "the lorentz factors in the lab and in the center - of - mass frames are related by @xmath18 .    in the special case of @xmath19 our results for the total emitted energy as well as for its angular and frequency distribution are in perfect agreement with the results of kovacs and thorne @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized in five sections of which this introduction is the first . in section 2 the model , the basic formulae and the iterative procedure , that will be employed , are described .",
    "also , a complete orthonormal set of graviton polarization tensors in arbitrary dimensions , appropriate for the problem at hand are explicitly constructed . in section 3 the expressions of the local and non - local contributions to the gravitational radiation source",
    "are obtained .",
    "the phenomenon of destructive interference of the leading local and non - local terms is shown .",
    "the total radiation amplitude is also obtained .",
    "section 4 contains the computation of the leading ultra - relativistic order emitted energy in the classical theory in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "it also contains a detailed discussion of the frequency and angular distributions of the emitted radiation .",
    "the zero frequency limit of the radiation is analyzed in detail in all dimensions . in the same section the domain of validity of the classical computation",
    "is discussed . the final result for the radiation efficiency",
    "is given and the unnatural possibility for it , to take values greater than one and even diverge in the massless limit for @xmath6 extra dimensions , is critically analyzed .",
    "a summary together with a few final comments are given in the final conclusion section .",
    "we will study gravitational bremsstrahlung both in uncompactified minkowski space - time @xmath20 and in the add model @xmath21 with the @xmath0 extra dimensions compactified on a torus . in both cases the collision will be confined on a brane @xmath22 , and the @xmath23dimensional cartesian coordinates are split as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the brane subspace @xmath22 is selected by the initial conditions on the particle velocities and is fixed throughout the collision process , since the gravitational interaction can not expel the particles from the brane .",
    "consider two point masses @xmath11 and @xmath28 moving along the world - lines @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and interacting with the @xmath23dimensional gravitational field .",
    "the corresponding action is @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the ein - bein of the trajectory and the summation is over the two particles .",
    "the metric signature is chosen to be @xmath35 and our convention for the riemann tensor is @xmath36 , with @xmath37 . finally , the ricci tensor and curvature scalar are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the action is invariant under the general coordinate reparametrization of spacetime , as well as under the independent reparametrizations of the particle trajectories . for the trajectory of particle @xmath11",
    "the transformation is @xmath40 , under which all fields are scalars except for the einbein @xmath34 , which transforms according to @xmath41 .",
    "varying @xmath42 with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath43 one obtains the equations @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "two analogous equations are obtained by varying with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , while variation of @xmath48 leads to the einstein equations @xmath49    strictly speaking the notion of point - like particles is not compatible with full non - linear gravity .",
    "nevertheless , it still makes sense in the context of the weak - field perturbation expansion around flat spacetime , which will be adopted here . in this approach",
    "one writes the metric as @xmath50 and expands all quantities in powers of @xmath51 , using @xmath52 to raise and lower the indices",
    ". the flat background will be either @xmath53-dimensional minkowski space @xmath54 , or the product @xmath21 ( @xmath55 ) of four - dimensional minkowski and a @xmath56torus .",
    "it is convenient to define the quantity @xmath57 and fix the general coordinate reparametrization symmetry by choosing to work in the flat - space harmonic gauge @xmath58    the reparametrization freedom of the particle trajectories will be dealt with later .",
    "the expansion of several relevant quantities in powers of @xmath51 is given in appendix [ app1 ] .",
    "in particular , the einstein tensor in the harmonic gauge becomes @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the flat dalembert operator , @xmath61 is the @xmath62 part of @xmath63 given by @xmath64 while @xmath65 stands for all cubic and higher in @xmath51 terms in the einstein tensor .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "usually in the add scenario one assumes that matter is localized on the brane , i.e. restricted to the subspace @xmath22 .",
    "this assumption is non - contradictory within the linearized gravity , since the matter energy momentum in this case is purely flat - space tensor , whose conservation does not involve gravity . in the full non - linear gravity the @xmath53-dimensional bianchi identity @xmath66_{,n } - \\frac{1}{2 } \\ , g_{np , m }   t^{np}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] implies @xmath53-dimensional geodesic equations for the particles ( [ eomp ] ) ( and similarly for brane fields ) , which are generally inconsistent with the assumption of matter localization on the brane . for this reason we have to consider the world - lines in ( [ actiongk ] ) from the beginning as @xmath53-dimensional curves .",
    "in general , without any extra forces ensuring confinement , the particle motion can be localized on the brane only by suitable initial conditions .",
    "however , it will be shown that the gravitational interaction treated perturbatively will not expel the colliding particles from the brane at least to leading order in our iterative scheme .",
    "this will be sufficient for the consistency of our computation of bremsstrahlung .",
    "another technical difference from the standard add approach , also related to the fact that our treatment appeals to the @xmath53-dimensional picture rather than to the four - dimensional one , will be the treatment of the graviton as a @xmath53-dimensional massless particle , instead of as a set of four - dimensional massive fields of spins @xmath67 by suitable rearrangement of the components of the @xmath53-dimensional graviton @xcite . in particular , it will be more convenient here to choose directly the @xmath68 polarization tensors of the graviton propagating in the bulk , rather than to split them into polarizations of massive particles in four dimensions .      our approach is identical to the one used in simpler models in @xcite and @xcite",
    ". the iterative solution of the above field equations and gauge fixing conditions amounts to formally expanding and computing all fields step - by - step in the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes any of the fields @xmath43 , @xmath71 , @xmath34 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 and with the left superscript labeling the step of the iteration .    _",
    "the zeroth order solution _ is trivial .",
    "it describes the two particles moving with constant velocities ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively in the @xmath22 subspace , whose indices are labeled by lower case greek letters @xmath76 .",
    "correspondingly , their trajectories @xmath77 , and similarly for @xmath78 , are the straight lines @xmath79 in the absence of any gravitational field @xmath80 the lagrange multipliers are chosen equal to the corresponding particle masses @xmath81 so that the trajectories are parametrized by the corresponding proper times and the four - velocities satisfy the normalization conditions @xmath82 .",
    "we choose to work in the lorentz frame in which the target particle @xmath28 is initially at rest and with the projectile @xmath11 moving along the @xmath83-axis .",
    "also , we introduce the space - like vector @xmath84 lying on the brane , with : @xmath85 with no loss of generality one can further assume @xmath86 and choose the @xmath87-axis along @xmath88 .",

    "explicitly , from the zeroth order trajectories one obtains the zeroth order energy - momentum tensor @xmath94 which in this order has only @xmath95 components , and from the first order einstein equations , given in the harmonic gauge by @xmath96 the first order correction @xmath97 to the metric is obtained .",

    "is a consequence of the conservation of @xmath110 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that in the equation of motion ( [ z1eq ] ) of particle @xmath11 the gravitational field on the right hand side is the one due to @xmath28 .",
    "singularities due to the action on @xmath11 of its own gravitational field can be removed in lowest order by classical renormalization of the affine parameter of its trajectory @xcite ; this will be enough for our purposes .",
    "in what follows we will omit self - action terms and consider only mutual gravitational interaction .",
    "_ in the next order of iteration _",
    "one obtains the leading contribution to gravitational radiation .",
    "it is due to the accelerated particles , as well as to the cubic gravitational self - interaction .",
    "indeed , the einstein field equation reduces for the second order correction @xmath111 of the gravitational field to @xmath112 with the source term having three contributions : @xmath113 the first two terms of @xmath114 ( [ source2 ] ) represent the particles contribution to radiation . as obtained to this order from ( [ eeq ] ) they are . ]",

    "finally , the part @xmath61 of @xmath114 represents the contribution of the gravitational field itself to gravitational radiation .",
    "given that @xmath61 is quadratic in @xmath51 , consistency of the iteration to this order requires to substitute @xmath119 inside @xmath42 .",

    "this non - locality is due to the non - linearity of the theory and , as will be shown , leads to important differences in the radiation spectrum from linear theories like electromagnetism .",
    "more detailed discussions of this point in four dimensions can be found in @xcite , as well as in its generalization to arbitrary dimension but in a simpler non - linear model in @xcite .",
    "the same tensor @xmath61 considered as a quadratic form in @xmath123 plays the role of an effective energy - momentum tensor of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is based on the conservation equation ( [ divtau ] ) in combination with the asymptotic properties of the solutions of the flat - space dalembert equation and is valid in all space - time dimensions .",
    "recall , that in four dimensions @xmath124 , which according to ( [ hanuleq ] ) is due of a static or a uniformly moving mass , falls - off as @xmath125 , and the corresponding `` field strength '' ( derivatives @xmath126 ) behave as @xmath127 . on the other hand , the fall - off of the radiative component of the retarded potential @xmath128 is @xmath125 and the same for its derivatives @xmath129 .",
    "correspondingly , in @xmath53-dimensional minkowski space - time the behaviors of @xmath122 and its derivatives @xmath130 are @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively , where @xmath133 is the radial coordinate in the @xmath134-dimensional space .",
    "the corresponding fall - off for the radiation field can be found from the recurrence relations for green s functions in neighboring dimensions .",
    "the derivation looks different in even and odd dimensions , but it leads to the same result , namely ( see appendix [ notes ] ) @xmath135 in the case of the add model the behavior of the field of a uniformly moving mass depends on the ratio of @xmath133 to the compactification radius @xmath136 . for @xmath137",
    "it has the @xmath53-dimensional behavior @xmath131 , while for @xmath138 it decreases as @xmath125 ( with @xmath133 being the radial coordinate in three - space ) .",
    "we assume that the observational wave - zone corresponds to this second condition .",
    "then , the fall - off of the radiation field in the wave - zone will be the same as in four dimensions .",
    "since the effective stress - tensor @xmath139 is a homogeneous second order function of @xmath140 and its derivatives , its fall - off in @xmath53-dimensional minkowski will be @xmath141 and in the add case @xmath127 .",
    "this is precisely what is needed to get non - zero flux of radiation in the wave zone through the @xmath142-dimensional sphere at spatial infinity of @xmath143 , or through the corresponding two - dimensional sphere in the add scenario .",
    "note that the use of pseudotensors to define the momentum density of gravitational radiation leads to the same result .",
    "also , note that as a consequence of the above behavior the higher order non - linear terms contained in @xmath65 of eq.([smn ] ) do not contribute to the radiation energy - momentum .",
    "following weinberg @xcite , we introduce the gravitational energy - momentum @xmath144 .",
    "combined with the matter part @xmath145 , the total energy - momentum of the system is conserved , i.e. it satisfies @xmath146 which is a consequence of the identity @xmath147 , and which to second order in the above iteration scheme coincides with ( [ divtau ] ) .",
    "consider the flat - space world - tube @xmath148 bounded by two space - like hypersurfaces @xmath149 defined at @xmath150 , and the infinitely far away time - like cylindrical surface @xmath151 .",

    "using the energy - momentum conservation equation ( [ divweinberg ] ) one can write successively for the emitted radiation momentum @xmath155 @xmath156 to justify the above steps , notice that the first equality is ( with @xmath157 in both @xmath153 and @xmath154 surfaces ) the statement that @xmath155 is minus the change of momentum of the matter system ; for the second one uses the fact that the matter system is localized inside the volume and the contribution of @xmath151 on the surface integral vanishes .",
    "gauss theorem was used next , together with ( [ divweinberg ] ) to end up with the surface integral of @xmath158 . finally , for the last equality one used the fact that the surface integrals of @xmath158 on @xmath153 and @xmath154 are zero .    in particular , to the order of our computation in the previous subsection , using gauss theorem , equations ( [ smn ] ) , ( [ natag_0 ] ) and the gauge fixing condition",

    "<S> a classical computation of gravitational bremsstrahlung in ultra - planckian collisions of massive point particles is presented in an arbitrary number @xmath0 of toroidal or non - compact extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> our method generalizes the post - linear formalism of general relativity to the multidimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> the total emitted energy , as well as its angular and frequency distribution are discussed in detail . in terms of the gravitational radius @xmath1 of the collision energy , the impact parameter @xmath2 and the lorentz factor in the cm frame , </S>",
    "<S> the leading order radiation efficiency in the lab frame is shown to be @xmath3 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 , up to a known @xmath0-dependent coefficient and a @xmath7 factor for @xmath8 , while the characteristic frequency of the radiation is @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the low frequency part of the radiation ( soft gravitons ) to the total radiated energy is shown to be negligible for all values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the domain of validity of the classical result is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is shown that within the region of validity of our approach the efficiency can obtain unnatural values greater than one , which is interpreted to mean that the peripheral ultra - planckian collisions should be strongly radiation damped .    </S>",
