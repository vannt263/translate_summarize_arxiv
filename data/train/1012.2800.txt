    "the understanding of the stellar nuclear production sites and evolution scenarios is of great current interest .",
    "a large number of high - resolution spectral studies targeting metal - poor objects selected by mining the hk survey @xcite and the he s @xcite have measured a wide set of chemical elements ranging from li ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) to the n - capture species ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , providing constraints on how the stars formed as well as on the nucleosynthetic processes that took place in the early galaxy .",
    "in contrast , only one single measurement of f in extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars has been published to date @xcite .",
    "the most accessible lines suited for f measurements , the vibration - rotation transition of the hf molecule , are located in the k band , requiring the use of high - resolution , ir spectrographs mounted on 8 m class telescope to target halo stars , a configuration not available until recently .",
    "fluorine is an element of particular interest , extremely sensitive to the physical conditions within stars .",
    "although the single stable f isotope , @xmath5f , is not involved in the main reactions taking place in the cores of stars , it can be created and destroyed in several different ways , and its dominant source is not yet clear .",
    "theoretical modeling has indicated ( at least ) three possible sites for f production .",
    "@xcite proposed first that f is produced by neutrino spallation on @xmath6ne ; @xmath6ne(@xmath7,@xmath8)@xmath5f .",
    "second , modeling shows that low- metallicity , low - mass ( m@xmath93 - 4m@xmath4 ) agb stars synthesize very large quantities of f ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) via the reactions @xmath10n(n , p)@xmath10c(@xmath11,@xmath12)@xmath13o(@xmath14)@xmath15n(@xmath16)@xmath5f * and @xmath10n(@xmath11,@xmath12)@xmath13f(@xmath17)@xmath13o(p,@xmath11)@xmath15n(@xmath11,@xmath12)@xmath5f * , where the neutrons are provided by @xmath1c(@xmath18)@xmath19o and the protons mainly by @xmath10n(@xmath20)@xmath10c ( see * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , massive agb stars are expected to destroy f via hot bottom burning ( hbb ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . finally , @xcite proposed that wolf - rayet stars are a possible source for f , through the @xmath10n(@xmath16)@xmath13 f(@xmath17)@xmath13o(@xmath14)@xmath15n(@xmath16)@xmath5f chain .",
    "while the physical conditions for f production exist in several phases of stellar evolution , the precise contribution of each of these three sites to the galactic f evolution is not known ,    the measurements of f content in any object have been few and give conflicting evidence about the origin of f in the universe .",
    "@xcite showed that the inclusion of all of sites in galactic chemical evolution models is necessary to reproduce the f abundances measured in milky way field stars . in their model ,",
    "agb stars are responsible for significant amounts of f production in the early universe , because of the metallicity dependence of their yields , while wr stars are significant contributors at solar and super - solar metallicities .",
    "@xcite derived f abundances in giants that recorded the chemical evolution ( k and m giants ) , in agb giants that were dredging up freshly minted f from their interiors ( ms , s , sc , n and j giants ) , and in giants that had been polluted by one of the former ( ba giants ) .",
    "they suggested that the overproduction of f in the agb stars ( factors of 3 to 30 with respect to the solar system in the most extreme s and n stars ) showed that agb stars are likely to major contributors to the galactic f abundance , at least at metallicities close to solar .",
    "in addition , the largest f overabundances measured could not be explained with standard agb models and required additional mixing to achieve the desired amounts .",
    "however , recent results by @xcite and @xcite suggest that because of a possible lack of proper accounting for c - bearing molecules ( i.e. ch , cn , co and c@xmath21 ) contribution , the f abundances reported in @xcite for solar metallicity giants , which relied on the same hf line used in the present analysis , had been overestimated . therefore , the long standing problem of the discrepancy between the high [ f / fe](a ) = log n(a)+12 .",
    "[ x / y ] = log(x / x@xmath4 ) @xmath2 log(y / y@xmath4 ) . ] and [ f / o ] ratios measured in solar metallicity giants and the low ones resulting from the models , is likely solved by the adoption of a more complete molecular line list for the synthetic spectra .",
    "in fact , the @xcite models account fully for the f abundances measured in several c - stars ranging from solar metallicity to slightly metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath220.0 to @xmath22 - 0.5 ) @xcite .",
    "while the above results make it clear that solar metallicity agb stars make at least some f , there is not yet a consensus on the overall contribution of agb stars throughout the chemical evolution of stellar systems .",
    "@xcite measured f in red giants in the lmc and @xmath23 cen .",
    "they found that f / o declines as the o abundance decreases and the two @xmath23 cen giants have particularly low f / o values .",
    "they argue that their results are qualitatively consistent with most f production coming from either neutrino nucleosynthesis or wr stars rather than agb stars in these systems , which certainly have a different chemical evolution than the milky way .",
    "in particular , the low f abundances in metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath24 ) @xmath23 cen stars that are enriched in s - process elements is difficult to reconcile with the idea that metal - poor agb stars are major contributors to f production .",
    "f has also been measured in stars in the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "the f / o results there can be explained by contributions by both agb and wr stars , although the lack of an s - process enhancement in the most f - rich bulge stars suggests that agb stars may play a less prominent role in the bulge than has been inferred for the disk .",
    "measurements of fluorine in the interstellar medium @xcite show no evidence of f over - abundances due to the neutrino process in snii .",
    "the f production in rotating wr stars has been reconsidered by @xcite , who found that f yields are significantly lower than the @xcite predictions , indicating that their contribution to the galactic f budget would be negligible .",
    "these results suggest that at low - metallicity agb stars play a major role in f production , although this idea would leave the @xmath23 cen results unexplained .",
    "the idea of agb stars as producers of f is supported by the large f enhancements found in post - agb stars @xcite and planetary nebulae ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the progeny of agb stars as well as the results for abundances in milky way agb stars cited above .",
    "however , these observations are focused on [ fe / h]@xmath220 metallicity stars and do not address directly the question of the production of f production in metal - poor agb stars .",
    "while na measurements have been obtained for a much larger number of metal - poor stars , no quantitative study has been performed so far on the role of agb stars in its production , in particular at low metallicity . in",
    "thermally pulsing agb stars , na is mostly synthesized by proton captures on @xmath25ne .",
    "models indicate that the main source of na in low - mass agb stars , at least at solar metallicity , is the creation of a na pocket , located at the top ( or near the top ) of the @xmath10n pocket . at lower metallicities , other mechanisms , such as the neutron capture on @xmath25ne , which can occur both during the radiative @xmath1c burning and during the convective @xmath25ne burning , may become important ( cristallo et al 2006b and references therein ) . in general , according to e.g. , cristallo et al . and",
    "@xcite , the production of na increase by about 1dex or more going from solar to [ fe / h ]   -2.3 , a similar metallicity to that of the stars in our sample .",
    "this is due to a higher efficiency of all the na nucleosynthesis channels described above .",
    "the testing of such predictions is important to constraint details of the key reactions involved .",
    "carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars provide an opportunity to directly measure the f and na production in low - mass , metal - poor agb stars .",
    "these stars are chemically peculiar objects , characterized by an overabundance of c ( [ c / fe]@xmath261@xmath270.5 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ] ) accounting for 10 - 20% of stars below [ fe / h]@xmath282.5 @xcite .",
    "less than a third of cemp stars exhibit no enhancement in heavy elements ( cemp - no ) , while most of these objects ( over 70% * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are characterized , by an overabundance of n - capture , s - process , elements ( cemp - s ) .",
    "@xcite showed that likely _ all _ c - rich , extremely metal - poor stars with s - process enhancement ( the cemp - s stars ) belong to a binary system .",
    "cemp - s are then the metal - poor analog to the classical ch and ba stars : low - mass stars ( m@xmath220.8m@xmath4 ) whose slightly more massive ( between @xmath271.2 and @xmath272.5m@xmath4 , the exact range depending on metallicity ) companion , now a faint white dwarf , dumped material processed during its agb phase on their surfaces , leaving its chemical fingerprints in the composition of their envelopes .",
    "therefore , the nucleosynthetic processes taking place in extremely metal - poor , low - mass ( @xmath271.5m@xmath4 ) stars , now long extinct , can be investigated through the study of cemp - s stars characteristics .",
    "the origin of cemp - no objects is , on the other hand , still a mystery .",
    "@xcite suggested that they may have formed as chemically `` normal '' low - mass stars and became c - enhanced through a path of self - enrichment due to anomalous mixing processes specific to low - metallicity stars .",
    "alternatively , as @xcite suggested , they could have been born from c - rich gas , possibly polluted by a previous generation of supernovae whose fall - back avoids the ejection of heavier elements during the explosion ( e.g.,from high - mass , rapidly rotating stars see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "objects like the recently discovered extremely - metal poor , c - rich damped lyman-@xmath11 system @xcite might turn out to be the connection between the yields of the pop iii stars and their later incorporation into cemp - no stars .    on the other hand",
    ", their abundance patterns could arise from early agb transfers from low - mass stars before any considerable s - process element production took place @xcite , or alternatively from an agb stars whose evolution was truncated by binary interaction ( see , e.g. , izzard & tout 2003 ) with its companion , the presently observed object .",
    "the measurement of a value or a strong upper limit on f abundance is of crucial importance to probe the origin of the chemical pattern observed in cemp - no stars given that f can be synthesized before the bulk of the s - process - element production . in @xcite , for instance , as early as the third - dredge - up episode for a 2m@xmath4 at [ fe / h]=@xmath22.3 , [ f / c]=-0.4 and [ f / fe]=1.65 , [ ba / c]=-1.5 and [ ba / fe]=0.5 ( and [ c / fe]=2.05 ) .",
    "therefore , a measurement in cemp - no stars of an amount of f comparable to c would strongly argue in favor of agb enrichment .",
    "@xcite measured the f abundance in a extremely metal - poor star for the first time , deriving an abundance of @xmath29(f)= @xmath30 corresponding to an abundance ratio [ f / fe ] = @xmath312.9 for the cemp - s star he  1305 + 0132 .",
    "@xcite compared this value to existing nucleosynthesis and mass transfer models .",
    "conclusion that an object with such an extreme f content should be exceedingly rare , while most cemp - s stars are expected to exhibit a noticeable but smaller f overabundance .",
    "we here present f abundance measurements for two cemp - s and upper limits for eight more cemp stars ( six",
    "cemp - s and two cemp - no ) and discuss the implications of our result on our current understanding of agb nucleosynthesis .",
    "data were collected using crires ( cryogenic high - resolution infrared echelle spectrograph , @xcite ) at vlt ut1 ( antu ) in a series of service runs between october 21th 2007 and february 28th 2008 .",
    "the slit - width was set to 04 yielding a resolution of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 refers to the width of the resolution elements , with a binning of 1@xmath341 .",
    "we used the 24/-i / i setup , which leads a wavelength coverage from 2299.3 to 2311.8 nm , 2315.2 to 2327.3 nm , 2330.4 to 2342.0 nm , and 2345.0 to 2356.0 nm  for chips @xmath351 to 4 respectively .",
    "our sample also included a well - studied c - normal metal - poor star ( hd  122563 ) to be used as a comparison star .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ratio for the program stars at @xmath222335 nm is about 120 per pixel .",
    "an early - type , fast - rotating star was observed right before or right after each one of the program star observations . to improve the accuracy of the telluric line subtraction procedure , those objects were chosen so that the science and calibration stars were observed at similar air - masses .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ratio for the telluric standard stars at @xmath222335 nm  is about 250 per pixel .",
    "the raw frames were processed with the crires gasgano pipeline ( version 1.6.0 ) .",
    "the 1d science and standard star spectra were wavelength - calibrated separately using the numerous telluric absorption lines present on all of the four detector arrays .",
    "such process was performed separately for the science and telluric standard star spectrum because of the limited reproducibility of the echelle grating position .",
    "the science spectra were then divided by the appropriate standard star spectra to correct for the telluric lines and the illumination pattern in the best possible way .",
    "it is worth noting that while the telluric lines are strong enough to be used for wavelength calibration , they are weak enough to be accounted for by standard star division ; hence their effect on the abundance measurements presented in this paper is negligible .",
    "more details about the observations can be found in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the determination of the adopted atmospheric parameters can be obtained photometrically , via the derivation of the effective temperature t@xmath36 from accurate t@xmath36-color relations and that of surface gravity , @xmath37 from a suitable isochrone .",
    "alternatively , t@xmath36 and @xmath37 can be derived spectroscopically , through the requirement of , respectively , of excitation and ionization equilibrium . in both cases ,",
    "the micro turbulent velocity @xmath38 is determined from minimizing the trend of derived abundance and equivalent widths of the fe lines .",
    "the spectral range covered by the program spectra do not include any fe lines and in general not enough features to allow the derivation of the atmospheric parameters .",
    "therefore , we have relied on the atmospheric parameters published in the recent literature or derived on the basis of photometry and our own proprietary optical spectra ( for details see masseron et al .",
    "the adopted atmospheric parameters and c and ba abundances ( which can not be derived from our spectra as no suitable features are present in the @xmath39 band ) , along with their uncertainties and sources are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "note that in some cases the uncertainties are not listed as the source paper did not report them .",
    "the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere can affect its structure : the higher the content of metals the larger the number of free electrons , available for the formation of the h@xmath40 ion , the main source of continuum opacity among stars with spectral types later than a. solar - scaled model atmospheres , which are generally ( appropriately ) adopted for the analysis of stars , likely provide different temperature profiles from those that are expected to be found in cemp stars , due to their large c and n enhancements . in our abundance analysis , we adopt c and n enhanced model atmospheres belonging to the osmarcs family @xcite calculated using the appropriate atmospheric parameters and c and n enhancements for each star . such models have a steeper temperature profile than their solar - scaled counterparts , affecting especially the computation of the strong lines , which form in the outer layers .",
    "the discussion of the calculation of the c and n - enhanced models , their features and their impact on the abundance determinations is beyond the aim of the present paper . for more details the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .",
    "elemental abundances for n , o , f , na and c isotopic ratios were obtained by synthetic spectra fits to the 1d extracted spectra for the sample stars .",
    "we used the turbospec synthesis code @xcite , which shares routines and input data with osmarcs .",
    "the code is characterized by chemical equilibrium including 92 atomic and over 500 molecular species , and van der waals collisional broadening by h , he , and h@xmath21 following @xcite .    * smoothing for the spectra was determining by simultaneous fitting of a number of weak unblended co lines . *",
    "a partial analysis of this dataset has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the present paper presents a reanalysis of the data , providing measurements for a wider set of elements .",
    "it is based on improved reduction of the spectra ( using a different pipeline version ) and makes use of more accurate atmospheric parameters determinations .",
    "hence the present results supersede those presented in @xcite .",
    "o was measured from the fit of several @xmath0c@xmath19o lines belonging to the @xmath7 = 2 - 0 and 3 - 1 overtone bands , as well as the @xmath7 = 4 - 2 and @xmath1co @xmath7 = 2 - 0 band - head regions . given the high c content of the stars under consideration , the co lines are very sensitive to o content , hence allowing for a very accurate o abundance measurement .",
    "@xmath0c/@xmath1c isotopic ratios were measured from the simultaneous fitting of several @xmath0c@xmath19o and @xmath1c@xmath19o lines .",
    "o abundance was then re - measured with the appropriate c isotopic ratio and the procedure was repeated to convergence .",
    "n abundance measurements are obtained from a number of cn lines scattered throughout our spectral range .",
    "three na lines are included within the available spectral region : 2334.842 nm , 2337.895 nm and 2337.914 nm .",
    "the latter is the strongest and , unlike the other two , is not severely blended with co features , making it the best candidate for na abundance measurements .",
    "it falls in a range of strong telluric contamination , therefore , in spite of careful and accurate modeling and subtraction of telluric features , in four out of eleven ( 10 cemp and one emp ) stars only upper limits ( 1@xmath41 ) to the na abundances could be placed .",
    "finally , f abundances ( and 1@xmath41 upper limits ) were measured from the fitting of the unblended hf line at 2335.833 nm .",
    "two more hf lines are present in our spectral range , 2324.062 and 2348.805 nm ; however both of them are blended with co features , hampering the accuracy of f abundance determinations obtained from their fitting .",
    "figure [ fig0 ] shows the fit of synthetic spectra to the hf feature at 2335.833 nm .",
    "the line list adopted are from @xcite for co , kurucz ( 1995 ) for cn and na , and @xcite for hf .",
    "they were checked for consistency by fitting the arcturus spectrum and that for our comparison star hd122563 .    in a few cases ( cs29502 - 92 , cs30314 - 67 and hd122563 ) no o abundance in conjunction with the literature c abundance could yield satisfactory fits of the co features .",
    "hence we sligthly adjusted the c abundance to improve the fit of such features .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the adoption of different model atmospheres in the present analysis and in the literature studies in which the adopted c - abundances are reported . in particular the inclusion of the appropriate opacities for the c and",
    "n enhanced atmospheres can result into the derivation of slightly different abundances from those obtained with solar - scaled models , which are generally adopted in the literature .",
    "the uncertainties in our measurements come from two sources ( excluding systematic nlte and 3d atmosphere effects , and atomic and molecular parameters uncertainties ) : error in the fitting of the spectral features , and due to the atmospheric parameters .    in the case of the fitting uncertainty",
    ", we estimate this component of the error by how well fitted we can match the synthesis to the actual spectrum ( we adopt @xmath220.1dex ) to estimate the errors due to the uncertainty in the atmospheric parameters for each element , we determined individually the sensitivities of the derived abundances to the adopted t@xmath42 , surface gravity @xmath37 , c enhancement , and [ fe / h ] , and then summing in quadrature the resulting uncertainties associated with each parameter and [ fe / h ] for an increase of 200k in t@xmath42 , finding an average of  0.5dex and 0.15dex respectively .",
    "hence , t@xmath42 is clearly the dominant source of uncertainty ( see table [ tab3 ] ) , and the covariance terms can be neglected . ] .",
    "note that for the stars for which no estimates for the atmospheric parameter uncertainties were provided in the source paper , we adopted 100k for t@xmath42 , 0.3 in @xmath37 , 0.15 in [ fe / h ] and 0.2 in [ c / fe ] .",
    "the sensitivities to the adopted atmospheric parameters are provided in table [ tab3 ] for he1152 - 0355 and hd5223 , which beside being the only two stars for which f is measured , are representative of the present sample for atmospheric parameters .",
    "the estimates of the errors reported are for abundances ( e.g. @xmath29(f ) or [ f / h ] ) , however the abundance ratios between two species ( e.g. [ f / fe ] ) have typically smaller errors since the effects due to uncertainties on the atmospheric parameters partially cancel out . as above mentioned , we can not obtain the information about fe sensitivity to atmospheric parameters in our sample stars , therefore we can not actually calculate the errors on the abundance ratios . in the following plots and discussion we adopt for the ratios of f , c , n , o and na to fe the same errors , keeping in mind that they are overestimates of the actual ones .",
    "the resulting n , o , f and na abundances , along with the observational errors , are listed in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "the hf lines in the spectrum of the comparison , c - normal star hd122563 were undetectable as expected , thus only an upper limit could be placed to the f abundance .",
    "this upper limit is consistent with the galactic chemical evolution model for such element , which predicts a value of [ f / o]@xmath430.6dex at @xmath29(o)=7.0 ( the minimum metallicity taken into account , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while we find [ f / o]@xmath440.1dex at @xmath29(o)=6.8 .    for the program stars ,",
    "as shown in table [ tab3 ] , f measurements could be derived only for two out of ten program stars ; with metallicities of [ fe / h]=@xmath21.2 and @xmath22.0 they are the object with the highest fe content of the sample . for the other eight , more metal - poor objects , only upper limits could be placed . because of the high sensitivity of the hf molecule to temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fteff ] , the level of upper limits on the f abundance is essentially set by the t@xmath36 in the atmosphere of the observed stars .    as f has been measured only in one ( not part of our sample ) extremely metal - poor star before",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our results for f abundances can not be compared to literature ones .",
    "however measurements for n , o and na have been previously reported for a subset of our sample .",
    "[ flit ] shows the excellent agreement with literature results for these species , which are all measured from transitions in the visible spectra .",
    "with measurements or upper limits for eight stars , we find a range in [ f / fe ] and [ f / c+n ] ratios in cemp stars ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fteff ] ) , with cemp - s [ f / fe ] values ranging from @xmath311.44dex to less than @xmath310.6dex .",
    "this confirms both that agb stars are characterized by range of efficiency in its production ( likely due to different metallicity and and mass ) , as predicted by theoretical low - mass , low - metallicity nucleosynthetic agb stars models .",
    "the two stars with measured f , hd 5223 and he 1152 - 0355 , are both cemp - s stars , and the presence of both f and s - process elements in their atmospheres is consistent with a picture where they were polluted by a low - mass agb star .    there is no object in our sample with a f content as high ( or close ) to that presented in @xcite for he 1305@xmath310132 .",
    "in fact , even the highest value for an upper limit in the present sample , [ f / fe]@xmath452.5 is almost a factor of three lower than those measured in he 1305@xmath310132 .",
    "possible sources of systematic offsets include difference in the model atmospheres ( we use spherical c - enhanced models , whereas schuler et al .",
    "adopt c - enhanced , plane parallel models ) and in the molecular transition data .",
    "in our analysis we used spherical c - enhanced models .",
    "these are cooler at the surface than the c - enhanced plane parallel models adopted by schuler et al , as can be seen in figure [ fmodels ] , which shows the difference of the thermal structure of the two models for one of our star in our sample ( he1152 - 0355 ) .",
    "the discrepancy in t reaches 100k .",
    "abundances derived from lines originating in the outer layers of the stellar atmosphere are thus lower in the spherical model case than in the plane parallel one .",
    "however , such affect is expected to affect strong lines ( in our case mostly co lines ) , while its effect on weak lines such as hf is expected to be very small .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec_atm ] , for the hf molecular transitions we use the data in @xcite , while schuler et al . use those in @xcite . while the @xmath46s for the hf(1 - 0 ) r9 line ( the only present in the schuler et al .",
    "spectral range ) and dissociation potential adopted are virtually identical , the excitation potential for the transition in @xcite is 0.227ev , well below the 0.48 adopted by schuler et al .",
    "such difference leads to an offset in the f abundances measured from the hf(1 - 0 ) r9 line . to asses",
    "such difference , we derived the f abundances adopting the same molecular transition parameters as schuler et al . , and found that the values obtained are _ at most",
    "_ 0.3dex larger using the @xcite excitation potential than with the @xcite one . hence , even taking into account the offset due to the difference in adopted excitation potential , the f abundance and [ f / fe ] ratio measured in he  1305 + 0132 are higher than any of the measurements or upper limits derived in our sample .",
    "it is noteworthy that the fe abundance in he  1305 + 0132 adopted in @xcite was quite uncertain .",
    "in fact , given the limited spectral coverage in the phoenix data and the lack of fe features in that range , the authors relied on [ fe / h ] measured from intermediate resolution spectra analysis @xcite , which reported an [ fe / h]=@xmath22.5@xmath470.5dex . more recent , high - resolution optical data suggest that he  1305 + 0132 is in fact more metal rich , with [ fe / h]@xmath481.92dex @xcite .",
    "when taking into account this fe abundance the [ f / fe ] ratio lowers by @xmath220.6dex , to a similar level to those measured in our sample .",
    "moreover , the f abundance itself , @xmath49(f ) can also be affected as the adoption of an appropriate , more metal - rich model atmosphere , whose outer layers are cooler than those of the metal - poor model atmosphere adopted previously , is expected to result in a lower f abundance .    although the present sample shows that there is a range in [ f / fe ] abundances in cemp stars , it is not yet clear what the maximum f production is , and larger number of f abundance measurements in cemp ( and emp ) stars is crucial to probe the matter .      since @xcite , considerable effort has been expended to model its production and explore the effect of uncertainties in the adopted parameters . the main issue to address was that the nucleosynthetic agb models failed to account for the high [ f / fe ] and",
    "[ f / o ] rations observed in @xcite in metal - rich intrinsic and extrinsic c - stars . while the recent results of @xcite and @xcite seem to have reconciled observations and model predictions at solar and slightly subsolar metallicity , large uncertainties in the @xmath5f production in agb stars , especially in the low - metallicity regime , still exist .",

    "it is well known that the standard agb models fail to reproduce the n abundances observed in c - rich stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we find similar results in our sample .",
    "the common explanation of such apparent disagreement is that extramixing processes take place at the bottom of the agb envelope , where part of the envelope material undergoes the cn cycle , turning carbon into nitrogen ( see the discussion at the end of this section ) .    as can be noticed from fig .",
    "[ fcnvsn ] the low mass models predict a n abundance which is lower than the measured ones , which are closer to the predictions of more massive agb stars ( 2.5 - 4m@xmath4 ) models , where hbb takes place .",

    "in fact , while essentially all c ( as @xmath0c ) comes from mass transfer , according to the low - mass agb models ( which do not include extramixing processes ) the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratios are very high , thus according to these models , very little @xmath1c is transferred with respect to @xmath0c ( the predicted isotopic ratio can be as high as 10@xmath53 , hence 10@xmath53 @xmath0c nuclei are transferred for a single @xmath1c nucleus ) .",

    "the stars in our sample undergo several mixing episodes ( i.e. first dredge - up , extramixing corresponding to the rgb bump ) from the main sequence to the evolutionary state we observe them in today .",
    "this mixing episodes are known to affect the c isotopic ratio in c normal stars .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that they also might affect the accreted c , altering the c isotopic ratio of the accreted material .",
    "this effect is however likely not important .",
    "in fact , similar values for c isotopic ratios are found in unevolved cemp - s stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which have not undergone any of such mixing episodes and have thus maintained the original @xmath0c/@xmath1c in transferred material .",
    "moreover , the extent of the effect of the mixing episodes on the accreted c isotopic ratio should likely depend on the time in its evolution when the c - rich material is transferred .",
    "since it is sensible to assume that the cemp - s stars in our sample underwent mass transfer at different times in their evolution , the fact that all the measured isotopic ratios are all quite low , argues that the effect of the mixing episodes on such quantity should be marginal .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to conclude that the measured c isotopic ratios indeed reflect that in the polluting material .    to account for such a high n abundance and low c isotopic ratios in low - mass agb stars ,",
    "we confirm that some degree of of extra - mixing with a partial activation of proton capture nucleosynthesis , the so - called cool bottom processing ( cbp ) , needs to be invoked @xcite . however , in most published works , such process is treated as a parameter and thus the amount of cn processing is highly uncertain , making the individual c and n abundance predictions much more sensitive to modeling details than their sum .",
    "this process is known to occur during the first red giant phase in stars with m@xmath92.5m@xmath4 @xcite and was suggested to occur between dredge up in agb stars @xcite .",
    "it consists of circulation of material from the base of the convective envelope into the thin radiative region located on top of the h - burning shell , where the material is processed by proton captures and then brought back to the envelope , producing the signature of cn processing at the stellar surface .",
    "the low @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratios , high n ( but with [ c / n]@xmath540 ) observed in cemp - s stars indicates that cbp also takes place in low metallicity agb stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the physical mechanism responsible for such process is still not clear .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed , e.g. , the mixing process could be driven by a molecular weight inversion created by the @xmath55he(@xmath55he,2p)@xmath53he reaction @xcite , or by magnetic buoyancy at the bottom of the envelope ( e.g. , palmerini , nollett , & busso 2008 ) .",
    "while we obtained measurements for o for all the stars in our sample , a comparison with the model predictions would not be meaningful .",
    "all the models discussed in the text start with solar - scaled composition . while this is not important for the other elements we discuss as",
    "their production in the agb nucleosynthesis is much larger than the initial content , this is not true for o , which is in fact typically produced at the [ o / fe]@xmath220.5 level , a value comparable to that measured in metal - poor stars , making the adoption of a correct initial o for the models important .",
    "the typical predicted values for o are in fact lower than the measured ones ; however it is presently not possible to determine whether this is due to the incorrect assumption on the model star initial composition or issues in the understanding of o nucleosynthesis in low - metallicity agb stars ( see for instance the impact of overshooting on o abundance , e.g. , herwig 2005 ara&a ) .",
    "f was measured only in two cemp stars in our sample , both s - process rich , while for the remaining eight objects ( including the two cemp - no stars ) only upper limits could be placed . therefore ,",

    "we invite the reader to keep in mind that this is an extrapolation to lower metallicity of the behaviour of the model and as such quite uncertain .    beside the sources of uncertainties discussed in the previous paragraphs , as mentioned before , currently agb nucleosynthesis calculations do not include cbp .",

    "finally , a marginal contribution is given by neutron capture on @xmath25ne in the @xmath1c - pocket . despite these different processes , na production in agb stars",
    "is less affected by nuclear uncertainties compared to f. for these reasons , agb predictions for na are expected to be more robust than f. fig .",

    "it is noteworthy how the discrepancy in na between these two models ( @xmath220.05dex at a given @xmath29 ( c+n ) is much smaller than that in f between the same models ( @xmath220.5dex ) , supporting the idea that na production is generally better understood and/or less sensitive to the recipes and parameters adopted in different families of models . as can be noticed from in fig .",
    "[ fig10b ] , the measured na abundances are consistent with pollution arising from a 1.25 to 1.75m@xmath4 agb star .",

    "a comparison of predictions from different families of low - metallicity , low - mass ( 1.25 to 1.75 m@xmath4 range ) agb nucleosynthesis models show that they reproduce well the observed na abundances in the cemp - s stars in our sample .",

    "f could only be measured in two cemp - s stars , while for the remaining eight objects only upper limits could be derived . however , these data are sufficient to show that a range of [ f / c+n ] values are produced in low - metallicity agb stars , in accord with predictions of the mass- and metallicity - dependence of f production in agb models .",
    "the only two f measurements obtained ( the cemp - s stars he1152 - 0355 and hd5223 respectively at [ fe / h]=@xmath21.27 and @xmath22.06 ) are accounted for , within the errors , low - mass , low - metallicity agb models . on the other hand , most of the derived upper limits for f abundance in cemp - s are not satisfactorily accounted for by nucleosynthetic computations . in fact , the comparison with four of the most recent models for low - mass ( 2.0m@xmath4 ) , low - metallicity agb nucleosynthetic models shows that there are large differences in the predictions between different families of models , which can not reproduce several of the upper limits , not providing any [ f / c+n ] ratios predictions low enough to account for the values measured in several of the sample stars .",
    "a comparison with @xcite models for different masses indicates that only objects more massive ( 2.5m@xmath65m@xmath454m@xmath4 ) that those generally considered as responsible for cemp - s peculiar abundances ( m@xmath271.5m@xmath4 ) produce the [ f / c+n ] ratios observed in about two thirds of our cemp - s sample .",
    "this possibility is not only unlikely because of simple imf considerations , but it is also challenged by the fact that at low metallicity , hbb is active in stars in this mass range , producing n and depleting c ( bringing the ratio to [ n / c]@xmath221 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ) and preventing the star from becoming a cemp - s polluter . *",
    "as shown in fig [ fig4 ] , the @xcite 1.25m@xmath4 model is the low - mass agb ones that comes closest to explaining the upper limits .",
    "given the discussed spread present in f production in different models , it is indeed possible that it affects also predictions for other masses , including 1.25m@xmath4 , hence accounting for the derived upper limits .",
    "it is however impossible , at present time , to systematically test this differences , as only @xcite provide f production calculations for several agb masses . *    we discussed two possible solutions that could explain the lowest f upper limit range .",
    "one is that the standard evolution of an agb star may be truncated by binary interaction , and a lower f abundance can be obtained in early tp pulses ( even though this would lead to lower ba production , which could make the accounting for observed ba abundances possibly more challenging ) . the other is the action of cbp , which may reduce the f in the agb envelope if such extra - mixing processes exposes material at temperatures high enough to activate @xmath5f(p,@xmath11 ) .",
    "the conclusion that can be drawn from the comparison between the data and the current models is that f production in low metallicity agb stars is probably not as high as expected on the basis of the current models .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , as discussed in the introduction , at solar metallicity model predictions are in agreement with the observations , therefore such problem seem to be peculiar to the low metallicity regime .",
    "agb nucleosynthesis , especially at low metallicity , is still not fully understood and a large number of uncertainties affect in particular f nucleosynthesis .",
    "improvements in nuclear reaction rate ( such as @xmath10c(@xmath11,@xmath12)@xmath13o and @xmath13f(@xmath11,p)@xmath52ne ) accuracy are needed , and a better grasp of the cbp mechanism is highly desirable .",
    "only one of the available models , by @xcite takes into account the appropriate c , n and o enhancements in the computation of the stellar opacities ; also , the prescription for mass loss is still rather uncertain .",
    "moreover , currently no model takes into account the effect on the agb evolution of the presence of a ( close ) companion , which could stimulate extra mixing and/or truncate the agb phase ( see e.g. izzard & tout 2003 ) , affecting the nucleosynthesis .",
    "the inclusion of these ingredients into a new generation of agb models might in the future be able to account for the present observations .",
    "from an observational point of view , pursuing a larger number of f abundance measurements in cemp stars is extremely important .",
    "in particular , k - band high - resolution spectral observations of cool ( t@xmath664200k ) cemp stars would allow actual measurements ( rather than upper limit placements ) of f even for low f abundances ( @xmath29(f)@xmath222 ) .",

    "<S> the metallicity of our sample ranges from [ fe / h]=@xmath23.4 to @xmath21.3 . </S>",
    "<S> f abundance could be measured only in two cemp - s stars . with [ f / fe]@xmath30.64 , </S>",
    "<S> one is mildly f - overabundant , while the other is f - rich , at [ f / fe]@xmath31.44 . for the remaining eight objects , including both cemp - no in our sample , only upper limits on f abundance could be placed . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements and upper limits show that there is a spread in [ f / c+n ] ratio in cemp - s stars as predicted by theory . </S>",
    "<S> predictions from nucleosynthetic models for low - mass , low - metallicity asymptotic giant branch stars , account for the derived f abundances , while the upper limits on f content derived for most of the stars are lower than the predicted values . </S>",
    "<S> the measured na content is accounted for by agb models in the 1.25 to 1.75m@xmath4 range , confirming that the stars responsible for the peculiar abundance pattern observed in cemp - s stars are low - mass , low - metallicity agb stars , in agreement with the most accepted astrophysical scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the mechanism of f production in current state - of - the - art low - metallicity low - mass agb models needs further scrutiny and that f measurements in a larger number of metal - poor stars are needed to better constraint the models . </S>"
