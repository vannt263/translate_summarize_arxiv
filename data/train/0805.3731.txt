    "new @xmath9-dimensional @xmath0- and @xmath1- and @xmath2-transforms were recently described in  @xcite .",
    "each transform is based on a compact semisimple lie group of rank @xmath9 and comes in three versions : analogs of fourier series , fourier integrals , and fourier transforms on an @xmath9-dimensional lattice .",
    "they are named @xmath0- and @xmath1- and @xmath2-transforms @xcite in recognition of the fact that they can be understood as generalizations of the one dimensional cosine , sine , and exponential fourier transform .",
    "the aim of this paper is to set the grounds for the 3-dimensional exploitation of transforms  described here as continuous transforms in a finite region @xmath3 of the 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath10 , and also as discrete transforms of functions given on a lattice grid of points @xmath4 of any density  in ready - to - use form .",
    "a positive integer @xmath5 specifies the density . in some cases ,",
    "the density of the grid is more flexible as it is dictated by not one , but two or three positive intergers .",
    "the grid could thus be made denser along certain axes .",
    "the symmetry of the lattice is dictated by the shape of @xmath3 , or equivalently , by the choice of the lie group .",
    "there are seven compact semisimple lie groups of rank 3 : @xmath11 throughout the paper we identify these cases by symbols that are often used for their respective lie algebras : @xmath12    the immediate motivation for this paper is our anticipation of the extensive use of the transforms given the need for processing the rapidly increasing amount of 3d digital data gathered today . in 2d , our group transforms offered only in some cases more than a marginal advantage , having emerged when satisfactory practical methods had already been developed and adequately implemented .",
    "so far , practical use of the functions in 2d rested on the fact that the continuous extension of the transformed lattice data displayed remarkably smooth interpolation between lattice points @xcite ( see also references therein ) .    special functions , which serve as the kernel of our transform ( we call them @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-functions or orbit functions ) , have simple symmetry property under the action of the corresponding affine weyl group .",
    "the affine group contains as a subgroup the group of translations in @xmath13 , which underlies the common fourier transform .",
    "this is the primary reason for the superior performance of our transforms , although detailed comparisons , rather than examples , will have to provide quantitative content to substantiate such a claim .",
    "other properties of the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-functions are not less important .    within each family ,",
    "functions are described in a uniform way for semisimple lie groups of any type and rank . in this work ,",
    "we illustrate this uniformity by considering all seven rank 3 group cases in parallel .",
    "the price to pay for the uniformity of methods is having to work with non - orthogonal bases which are not normalized .",
    "the functions are defined in @xmath13 and have continuous derivatives of all degrees .",
    "their orthogonality , when integrated over the finite region @xmath3 appropriate for each lie group , was shown in @xcite .",
    "the discrete orthogonality of @xmath0-functions in @xmath6 has already been described in @xcite and extensively used ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the completeness of these systems of functions directly follows from the completeness of the system of exponential functions .",
    "a laplace operator for each lie group is given in a different set of coordinates .",
    "the @xmath0- and @xmath1-functions are its eigenfunctions with known eigenvalues . on the boundary of @xmath3 , the @xmath0-functions have a vanishing normal derivative , while @xmath1-functions reach zero at the boundary .",
    "the functions have a number of other useful properties , which can be found in  @xcite .",
    "for example , the decomposition of their products into sums , the splitting of functions into as many mutually exclusive congruence classes as is the order of the center of the lie group , etc@xmath14 .    a different but valid viewpoint on some of the special functions presented here ,",
    "namely , functions symmetrized by the summation of constituent functions over a finite group  @xcite , may turn out to be rather useful .",
    "the finite group , in the case of @xmath0- and @xmath1-functions , is the weyl group of the corresponding semisimple lie group . in the case of @xmath2-functions , it is the even subgroup of the weyl group .",
    "the weyl group of @xmath15 is isomorphic to the group @xmath16 of the permutation of @xmath9 elements .",
    "this led to the recent implementations in @xcite , where instead of the weyl group of @xmath15 , the @xmath16 group is used , and variables are given relative to an orthonormal system of coordinates .",
    "furthermore , the even subgroup of @xmath16 is the alternating group .",
    "related transforms were introduced most recently in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section  [ sec_properties_definitions ] ,",
    "necessary definitions and properties of lie groups and algebras are given and discussed .",
    "semisimple lie groups of rank 3 are considered in detail in section  [ sec_algebras ] . for each of these groups",
    ", we lay down the information necessary to construct and use their orbit functions for 3d continuous and discrete transforms .",
    "section  [ sec_orbit - funcs ] is devoted to @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2- orbit functions and to their pertinent properties .",
    "continuous and discrete orbit - function transforms are presented in section  [ sec_c - s - e - transforms ] .",
    "some problems and possible applications arising in connection with orbit functions are formulated in the conclusion .",
    "an example of the application of orbit function transforms in the case of the group @xmath17 is given at the end of the paper .",
    "the notion of orbit function of @xmath9 variables depends essentially on the underlying semisimple lie group of rank @xmath9 .",
    "this section is intended to recall some of the standard properties of semisimple lie groups / lie algebras in general , and particularly those of rank 3 , as well as properties of related weyl groups .",
    "we also fix notation and terminology .",
    "additional information about such lie groups can be found for example in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 be the real euclidean space spanned by the simple roots of a  simple lie group  @xmath18 ( equivalently , lie algebra ) .",
    "the basis of the simple roots is hereafter referred to as the @xmath19-basis .",
    "an @xmath19-basis is not orthogonal and comprises simple roots of at most two different lengths . if  a  semisimple @xmath18 is not simple , the @xmath19-bases of its simple constituents are pairwise orthogonal .    for important practical ( i.e. computational ) reasons , it is advantageous to introduce also the basis of fundamental weights , hereafter referred to as the @xmath20-basis .",
    "moreover , for lie groups with simple roots of two different lengths , it is useful to introduce bases dual to @xmath19- and @xmath20-bases , denoted here as @xmath21- and @xmath22-bases respectively . occasionally it is also useful to work with the orthonormal basis @xmath23 of @xmath13 .",
    "each subsection contains an explicit elaboration of these bases for the groups we consider .",

    "it is an @xmath24-matrix . in particular , it provides the relation between @xmath19-and @xmath20-bases : @xmath25 where @xmath26 here @xmath27 denotes the inner product in @xmath13 .",

    "the root lattice @xmath31 and the weight lattice @xmath32 of @xmath18 are formed by all integer linear combinations of the @xmath19-basis and @xmath20-basis , @xmath33 in general , @xmath34 , but in rank 3 lie groups the equalities do not occur .",
    "similarly , we can introduce the dual lattices @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    in the weight lattice @xmath32",
    ", we define the cone of dominant weights @xmath37 and its subset of strictly dominant weights @xmath38 @xmath39    for any simple lie group @xmath18 there is a unique highest root @xmath40 @xmath41 coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , are natural numbers , referred to as marks and comarks respectively .",

    "it is assumed that we have fixed a semisimple lie group of rank 3 and that we consider its weight lattice @xmath32 .",
    "a @xmath51-orbit can be generated from any point @xmath52 , but in this paper we are almost always interested in @xmath51-orbits of points in @xmath32 .",

    "recently introduced transforms @xcite , based on @xmath16 and on its alternating subgroup , exploit orthonormal bases in @xmath13 , although even there , the corresponding fundamental regions do not have orthogonal adjacent faces , in general .",
    "* there is an additional freedom of choice whenever the underlying lie group is not simple .",

    "+ for the expansion of class functions on the product group , we can combine @xmath0-functions on one with @xmath1-functions on the other .",
    "similarly , we can combine @xmath0- or @xmath1-functions with @xmath2-functions , enlarging appropriately the fundamental region of the @xmath2-functions .",
    "+ in much the same way , discretization can proceed differently on @xmath377 then on @xmath378 .",
    "the corresponding integers @xmath79 , @xmath80 that fix it can be as different as one desires .",
    "thus the density of grid points in @xmath379 may be very different on the two orthogonal components .",
    "* a number of other properties of the orbit functions may prove to be useful ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let us point out that each of the three types of functions split into mutually exclusive congruence classes .",
    "for a given semisimple lie group , the number of congruence classes equals the order of the center of the lie group . * the possibility to introduce the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-functions by summation over a finite noncrystallographic coxeter groups instead of the weyl group of a lie group appears to be rather interesting . in 3d",
    "there is just one such group @xmath380 , the icosahedral group of order 120 .",
    "most of the properties carry over to this case in a simple straightforward way .",
    "the exception is the orthogonality , continuous or discrete .",
    "there is an analog of the fundamental region , but no lattice .",
    "its role , perhaps , should be played by some quasicrystal ?",
    "as an example , we chose to interpolate a discretization of a known function , namely the gaussian function shown in equation  ( [ eq_gauss ] ) @xmath381 where @xmath382 is a fixed point inside the fundamental region .    the first test to be undertaken is to sample the function in the points of the grid @xmath6 for several values of @xmath5 .",

    "[ figerror]b shows the standard deviation of the sample set .",
    "it decreases in much the same way the error did in function of @xmath5 . as a means to show what takes place visually , we give a plot of @xmath386 as compared to @xmath387 on the parametric line given by the transformation @xmath388 fig .",

    ", the set of pairwise orthogonal functions is not unique , i.e. one can scale all @xmath86 by integer multiplier @xmath397 with @xmath398 .",
    "this leads to a shifted system of orbit functions , that take the exact same values on the discrete grid @xmath6 , but do in fact differ in their continuous behavior . such a shifted system of functions can be understood as higher harmonics of the original functions on the grid @xmath6 .    examples with original and shifted systems of orbit functions follow .",

    "the result is enlightening .",
    "the case using the shifted set of orbit functions exhibits a degree of error far above what could be tolerated , due to the fact that the higher harmonics of the @xmath0-functions , as expected , oscillate more .",
    "this derogatory result should not , however , dismiss the use of such higher harmonics .",
    "the gaussian function extrapolated here is very smooth , and should thus be extrapolated with a sum of smoother functions .",
    "but in real life applications , the data could be quite chaotic , thus the use of higher harmonics could be useful .",
    "it is also possible not to shift the entire set , but only a specific subset , and at that , not all should be shifted by the same factor .",
    "careful consideration must be taken , because the functions do not obey the simplistic rule that a shifted function is equal to its counterpart .",
    "in fact , the set of adjacent functions is paired according to a reflective symmetry , but not according to translation symmetry .      work supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada , the mind research institute , by mitacs , and by lockheed martin canada .",
