    "one of the prime tasks of the lhc will be to probe the mechanism of electroweak gauge symmetry breaking . beyond observation of the various cp even and cp odd scalars which nature",
    "may have in store for us,@xcite this means the determination of the couplings of the higgs boson to the known fermions and gauge bosons , i.e. the measurement of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 couplings , to the extent possible .",
    "clearly this task very much depends on the expected higgs boson mass . for @xmath7  gev and within the sm , only the @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels",
    "are expected to be observable , and the two gauge boson modes are related by su(2 )",
    ". a much richer spectrum of decay modes is predicted for the intermediate mass range , i.e. if a sm - like higgs boson has a mass between the reach of lep2 ( @xmath10  gev ) and the @xmath11-pair threshold .",
    "the main reasons for focusing on this range are present indications from electroweak precision data , which favor @xmath12  gev,@xcite as well as expectations within the mssm , which predicts the lightest higgs boson to have a mass @xmath13  gev .",
    "recently , an analysis of higgs coupling measurements at the lhc was completed for this intermediate mass range  @xcite and in this talk i sumarize the results .",
    "the total production cross section for a sm higgs boson at the lhc is dominated by the gluon fusion process , @xmath14 , which largely proceeds via a top - quark loop .",
    "thus , inclusive higgs searches will collectively be called `` gluon fusion '' channels in the following .",
    "three inclusive channels are highly promising for the sm higgs boson search,@xcite [ eq : gghaa ] ggh , m_h 150  gev , + [ eq : gghzz ] gghzz^*4,m_h 130  gev , and [ eq : gghww ] gghww^*|| , m_h 130  gev .",
    "the @xmath15 signal can be observed as a narrow and high statistics @xmath16 invariant mass peak , albeit on a very large diphoton background .",
    "a few tens of @xmath17 events are expected to be visible in 100  fb@xmath0 of data , with excellent signal to background ratios ( s / b ) , ranging between 1:1 and 6:1 , in a narrow four - lepton invariant mass peak . finally , the @xmath18 mode is visible as a broad enhancement of event rate in a 4-lepton transverse mass distribution , with s / b between 1:4 and 1:1 ( for favorable values of the higgs mass , around 170  gev ) .",
    "additional , and , as we shall see , crucial information on the higgs boson can be obtained by isolating higgs production in weak boson fusion ( wbf ) , i.e. by separately observing @xmath19 and crossing related processes , in which the higgs is radiated off a @xmath20-channel @xmath21 or @xmath11 . specifically , it was recently shown in parton level analyses that the weak boson fusion channels , with subsequent higgs decay into photon pairs,@xcite [ eq : wbfhaa ] qqqqh , h , m_h 150  gev , into @xmath22 pairs,@xcite [ eq : wbfhtautau ] qqqqh , h , m_h 140  gev , or into @xmath21 pairs  @xcite [ eq : wbfhww ] qqqqh , hww^(*)e^^/_t , m_h 120  gev , can be isolated at the lhc .",
    "the weak boson fusion channels utilize the significant background reductions which are expected from double forward jet tagging  @xcite and central jet vetoing techniques,@xcite and promise low background environments in which higgs decays can be studied in detail .    [",
    "table : wbf.ww ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     an example of expected events rates ( after cuts and including efficiency factors ) are summarized in table  [ table : wbf.ww ] for the @xmath23 signal .",
    "the rates and ensuing statistical errors of the signal cross section are given for 100  fb@xmath0 of data collcted in both the atlas and the cms detector .",
    "the statistical accuracy with which the signal cross sections of the processes in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gghaa]-[eq : wbfhww ] ) can be determined is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "in order to translate the cross section measurements of the various higgs production and decay channels into measurements of higgs boson properties , in particular into measurements of the various higgs boson couplings to gauge fields and fermions , it is convenient to rewrite them in terms of partial widths of various higgs boson decay channels .",
    "the higgs - fermion couplings @xmath24 , for example , which in the sm are given by the fermion masses , @xmath25 , can be traded for @xmath26 .",
    "similarly the square of the @xmath4 coupling ( @xmath27 in the sm ) or the @xmath5 coupling is proportional to the partial widths @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 determine the squares of the effective @xmath6 and @xmath32 couplings .",
    "the higgs production cross sections are governed by the same squares of couplings , hence , @xmath33 ( for @xmath34 ) .",
    "combined with the branching fractions @xmath35 the various signal cross sections measure different combinations of higgs boson partial and total widths , @xmath36 .",
    "the production rate for wbf is a mixture of @xmath37 and @xmath38 processes , and we can not distinguish between the two experimentally . in a large class of models",
    "the ratio of @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings is identical to the one in the sm , however , and this includes the mssm .",
    "we therefore assume that 1 ) the @xmath39 and @xmath40 partial widths are related by su(2 ) as in the sm , i.e. their ratio , @xmath41 , is given by the sm value , @xmath42 .",
    "note that this assumption can be tested , at the 15 - 20% level for @xmath43  gev , by forming the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "with @xmath45-universality , the three weak boson fusion cross sections give us direct measurements of three combinations of ( partial ) widths , x_= _ w_&from & qqqqh , h , + x_= _ w_&from & qqqqh , h , + x_w = _ w^2&from & qqqqh , hww^ ( * ) , in addition the three gluon fusion channels provide measurements of y_= _ g_&from & ggh , + y_z = _ g_z&from & gghzz^ ( * ) , + y_w = _ g_w&from & gghww^ ( * ) .",
    "when extracting higgs couplings , the qcd uncertainties of production cross sections enter .",
    "these can be estimated via the residual scale dependence of the nlo predictions and are small ( of order 5% ) for the wbf case,@xcite while larger uncertainties of about 20% are found for gluon fusion.@xcite    a first test of the higgs sector is provided by taking ratios of the @xmath46 s and ratios of the @xmath47 s .",
    "qcd uncertainties , and all other uncertainties related to the initial state , like luminosity and pdf errors , cancel in these ratios .",
    "they test @xmath45-universality , and compare the @xmath48 yukawa coupling with the @xmath4 coupling .",
    "typical errors on these cross section ratios are expected to be in the 15 to 20% range . accepting an additional systematic error of about 20%",
    ", a measurement of the ratio @xmath49 , which determines the @xmath1 to @xmath4 coupling ratio , can be performed , by measuring the cross section ratios @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    beyond the measurement of coupling ratios ,",
    "minimal additional assumptions allow an indirect measurement of the total higgs width .",
    "first of all , the @xmath52 partial width , properly normalized , is measurable with an accuracy of order 10% .",
    "the @xmath52 is a third generation fermion with isospin @xmath53 , just like the @xmath54-quark . in many models ,",
    "the ratio of their coupling to the higgs is given by the @xmath52 to @xmath54 mass ratio .",
    "in addition to @xmath45-universality we thus assume that ( 2 ) @xmath55 and , finally , ( 3 ) the branching ratio for unexpected channels is small , i.e. @xmath56 .    with these three assumptions consider the observable @xmath57 @xmath58 provides a lower bound on @xmath59 . provided @xmath60 is small ( within the sm and for @xmath61  gev , @xmath62 and it is dominated by @xmath63 ) , the determination of @xmath58 provides a direct measurement of the @xmath64 partial width .",
    "once @xmath65 has been determined , the total width of the higgs boson is given by [ eq : gamma_tot ] = _ w^2x_w=1x_w ( x_(1+y ) + x_w(1+z ) + x_+ x_g ) ^2 1(1-)^2 .",
    "the extraction of the total higgs width , via eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_tot ] ) , requires a measurement of the @xmath66 cross section , which is expected to be available for @xmath67  gev.@xcite consequently , errors are large for higgs masses close to this lower limit but decrease to about 10% for higgs boson masses around the @xmath68 threshold .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) and look highly promising .",
    "with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath0 per experiment , the lhc can measure various ratios of higgs partial widths , with accuracies of order 10 to 20% .",
    "this translates into 5 to 10% measurements of various ratios of coupling constants . the ratio @xmath69 measures the coupling of down - type fermions relative to the higgs couplings to gauge bosons . to the extent that the @xmath6 triangle diagrams are dominated by the @xmath21 loop , the width ratio @xmath70 probes the same relationship .",
    "the fermion triangles leading to an effective @xmath32 coupling are expected to be dominated by the top - quark , thus , @xmath49 probes the coupling of up - type fermions relative to the @xmath4 coupling .",
    "finally , for higgs boson masses above @xmath71  gev , the absolute normalization of the @xmath4 coupling is accessible via the extraction of the @xmath64 partial width in weak boson fusion .",
    "these measurements test the crucial aspects of the higgs sector .",
    "the @xmath4 coupling , being linear in the higgs field , identifies the observed higgs boson as the scalar responsible for the spontaneous breaking of @xmath72 : a scalar without a vacuum expectation value does not exhibit such a trilinear coupling at tree level .",
    "the measurement of the ratios of @xmath73 and @xmath74 then probes the mass generation of both up and down type fermions .",
    "thus the lhc can do much more than mereley discover the higgs : it can give us detailed and reasonably precise information on the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
