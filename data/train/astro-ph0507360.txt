    "the recent discovery of a quadruply lensed quasar , sdss j1004 + 4112 , with unusually large image separations ( inada et al .",
    "2003 , oguri et al .",
    "2004 ) , has generated much interest .",
    "the quasar , at @xmath3 , is lensed by a galaxy cluster at @xmath0 into four bright images on an einstein ring of approximately @xmath8 in diameter .",
    "a faint fifth image is seen projected through the inner isophotes of the central brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ; inada et al .",
    "the qso is known to vary in brightness . assuming a nominal value for the hubble parameter @xmath9",
    ", it will be possible , for the first time , to model a cluster potential using complementary information on the value of the potential itself ( from the measured time delays ) , rather than only constraints on the first derivative of the potential ( i.e. , multiple - image positions ) and the second derivative of the potential ( i.e. , weak lensing ) .",
    "finally , the partial einstein ring , seen to pass through the lensed quasar images , is the most highly magnified quasar host galaxy known , permitting a unique probe of quasar hosts at @xmath10 ( kochanek et al .",
    "2005 , in prep . ) .",
    "strong lensing is now being used to constrain in detail the inner mass profile of galaxy clusters and for estimating the amount of sub - structure ( e.g. , gavazzi et al .",
    "2004 , kneib et al .",
    "2003 , smith et al .",
    "2005 , sand et al .",
    "2004 , broadhurst et al .",
    "2005a , b ) .",
    "a prediction of n - body simulations using the standard @xmath11-cdm cosmology ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1997 , nfw ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) is that the logarithmic gradient of the density profile of the cluster should be shallower than that of an isothermal profile . in the case of a1689 , where 30 background galaxies are found to be lensed into over 100 images ( broadhurst et al .",
    "2005a ) , the profile does continuously flatten towards the center like an nfw profile , but with a surprisingly high concentration , @xmath12 ( broadhurst et al . 2005b ) , compared with the much more diffuse halos predicted for massive clusters , @xmath13 ( e.g. , bullock et al .",
    "a1689 has the largest known einstein ring , @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 ) and thus projection effects may be important ( oguri et al . 2005 ) . a survey of more typical clusters is needed before drawing any general conclusions .",
    "the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has an unparalleled advantage for lensing work , providing depth , spatial resolution and color information .",
    "well resolved internal structure can be helpful in identifying counter - images of multiply imaged galaxies , particularly since distant star - forming galaxies often have complex and unique morphologies .",
    "a good lens model is required in order to take proper advantage of the resolved internal structure , as the parity and differential magnification of internal galaxy features varies between images of the same source , leading to confusion . without guidance from a lens model",
    ", it is hard to recognize counter - images because they often fall in unexpected places due to deflections by substructure and cluster galaxies .",
    "the angular position , @xmath16 , of an image is given by the lens equation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the deflection field of the lens , @xmath19 is the location of the source in the source plane and @xmath20 is the ratio of angular diameter distances from the lens to the source and from the observer to the source , respectively .",
    "thus , predictions must be made for a wide range of background source distances unless the source redshift is known .",
    "it should be appreciated that all the images of background galaxies lying within approximately twice the einstein radii pertaining to their redshifts will have one or more lensed counter - images .",
    "hence the usual identification of , at most , a few sets of multiple images per cluster , even in deep hst images , means the `` eyeball '' approach to finding counter - images can be far from exhaustive .",
    "we have had more success by using an iterative method , which we describe in  2 .",
    "here we report the identification of three new examples of multiply imaged galaxies behind the cluster sdss  j1004 + 4112 , and the measurement of spectroscopic redshifts for two of these .",
    "we use the multiply imaged galaxies and the five images of the qso for a preliminary estimate of the cluster mass distribution . in a future paper ( ofek et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) , we will study more exhaustively the joint constraints that can be imposed on both the mass distribution and on the background cosmology . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume cosmological parameters @xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "we have examined the single - orbit acs wide field camera images of sdss  j1004 + 4112 taken in @xmath25(f814w ) in 2004 , april 28 , and in @xmath26(f555w ) in 2005 , january 27 , each with a total exposure time of 2025  s , obtained as part of the castles program ( go-9744 , falco et al .",
    "individual exposures in each band were processed and combined with the standard space telescope science institute pipeline . in addition to the final images in each band , we have produced a `` true - color '' image by assigning a blue color to the @xmath26 count rate , red to the @xmath25 count rate , and green to a linear interpolation of the @xmath26 and @xmath25 count - rates ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . our goal is to identify multiple - image systems across as wide a range of redshifts as possible . in these data ,",
    "we have identified three sets of multiply imaged galaxies , in addition to the known images of the lensed qso .",
    "the identification of multiply imaged galaxies is achieved in an iterative manner .",
    "we first construct a simplified mass model , as described in  4 , initially based only on the images of the qso .",
    "we de - lens the pixels belonging to any given faint object , using the lens model , onto a sequence of source planes of different distances , re - lens these pixels back to the image plane , and compare the model - predicted locations and morphology of the new counter - images with the data .",
    "as new images are identified , they are incorporated into a refined lens model , enhancing the prospects of finding further sets of multiply imaged galaxies .",
    "the first set of lensed galaxy images to be identified in this way are labeled galaxy a ( a1-a5 in figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "they are observed as three arc - like images ( a2 , a3 , a4 ) that lie well outside the einstein ring traced by the qso images . as seen in fig .  1 , the distance scale increases by a large factor between the redshift of the quasar and of galaxy a. a counter - image of this galaxy",
    "is predicted by the model and readily identified as a1 , with an accurate reproduction of the internal morphology .",
    "a radial feature observed close to the central bcg ( best seen in fig .",
    "2 ) could be a fifth counter - image of galaxy a. however , depending on the exact slope of the inner region of the mass profile , it could also be associated with other galaxies in the field .",
    "deeper multi - color observations are required to confirm this possible association .",
    "this radial arc together with the fifth de - magnified image of the quasar will be helpful in constraining the inner mass distribution .",
    "two other sets of multiply imaged galaxies , galaxies b and c , were identified using the best fit model based on galaxy a and the qso .",
    "each is identified as a close pair of images ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "galaxy c has a different angular deflection scale , and therefore must lie at a higher redshift than galaxy b ( see table 1 for predictions ) .",
    "the model also predicts that galaxies b and c should both have faint , de - magnified images that are buried in the high surface brightness bcg and hence are undetectable in the available data .",
    "multi - slit spectroscopy was carried out with lris on the keck i 10  m telescope , on the nights of 2005 , march 4 and 6 , totaling 2.2  hrs of exposure time in dark conditions with @xmath27 seeing .",
    "the d560 dichroic was used with the 400/3400 grism and 600/7500 grating at 6850   , thus providing continuous wavelength coverage of 3500  @xmath28   .",
    "the fwhm spectral resolution and pixel scales were 6.8   , 4.5     and @xmath29 pixel@xmath22 , @xmath30 pixel@xmath22 on the blue and red cameras , respectively .",
    "spectra were taken of the a2 , a3 and a4 images of galaxy a , image b1 of galaxy b and image c1 of galaxy c.    * galaxy a *  the one dimensional spectra extracted for a2 , a3 , and a4 ( fig .",
    "3 ) clearly show that these are images of the same galaxy , although with some contamination of foreground galaxy light to a2 and a4 .",
    "several interstellar absorption lines were identified , from which we derive a redshift of @xmath1 for galaxy a.    * galaxy b *  in galaxy image b1 ( fig .",
    "1 ) we identified a single emission line at @xmath31   , with an equivalent width of @xmath32     and intrinsic fwhm of @xmath33 .",
    "we interpret this line as ly@xmath34 redshifted to @xmath35 , excluding the lower redshift alternative ( [ oii ] at @xmath36 , i.e. , in front of the cluster ) on the basis of the presence of multiple - images of this galaxy and the absence of h@xmath37 and [ oiii ] in the red - arm spectrum .",
    "since the instrumental resolution and the intrinsic width of the line are comparable , the ly@xmath4 profile appears relatively symmetric .",
    "* galaxy c *  we detected a weak continuum in c1 , but no obvious spectral features . the redshift of galaxy c therefore remains unconstrained spectroscopically .    in summary",
    ", we have measured the redshifts of two of the multiply imaged galaxies behind this cluster , the spectroscopic redshifts comparing favorably with the redshifts inferred from a lens model based only on the image positions and the quasar redshift .",
    "the geometrical distribution of the lensed images indicates that the projected mass distribution is elliptical in shape and lacks significant substructure .",
    "we have modeled the mass distribution with a softened power - law ellipsoid with surface density @xmath38 ( barkana 1998 ) , plus contributions from red cluster members modeled as softened isothermal spheres and normalized according to their luminosity , and additional shear from a sub - group @xmath8 to the northwest of the bcg , modeled as a softened power - law ellipsoid with @xmath39 .",
    "we find that this simple model , with 15 free parameters ( center of mass coordinates ; slope , ellipticity , position angle , core radius , normalizations of the cluster , galaxies and subgroup ; and coordinates of the quasar and of galaxies a and b in the source plane ) , and the measured redshifts of galaxies a , b , and the quasar , are sufficient to fit the two - dimensional positions of 10 lensed images ( q1-q5 , a1-a3 , b1 , b2 , i.e. , 20 constraints ) to a root - mean - square accuracy of @xmath40 in the source plane .",
    "the mass enclosed within a circular aperture including the images of galaxy a and corresponding to a radius @xmath6  kpc at the cluster redshift , is @xmath41 .",
    "we find a mean projected slope of @xmath42 , considerably shallower than isothermal ( @xmath43 ) , but comparable to the projected surface density derived from cdm - based simulations of massive halos ( e.g. , nfw ) .",
    "this result is consistent with an earlier claim of @xmath44 made by williams & saha ( 2004 ) using a nonparametric model based only on the quasar image positions .",
    "the ellipticity is relatively large , @xmath45 ( suggesting the mass distribution may be more complicated than the current model ; edge et al . 2003 ) and the mass has a projected position angle of pa@xmath46 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the orientation of the cluster mass distribution is approximately aligned with the isophotes of the bcg and the position of the sub - group . in figure  2 , we illustrate how our model reproduces the morphologies of the lensed images of galaxies a , b , and c.    llllll    qso & 5 & 1.0 & & 1.74 + galaxy a & 5 & 1.32 & 3.57 & 3.332 + galaxy b & 2 & 1.255 & 2.65 & 2.74 + galaxy c & 2 & 1.215 & 2.94 & +",
    "we have identified three new multiply imaged galaxies in acs images of the cluster lens sdss j1004 + 4112 , and have obtained redshifts for two of these systems .",
    "the relative deflections of the lensed quasar and the lensed galaxy images show a clear trend with redshift , increasing by @xmath47% over the range @xmath48 . the model - predicted deflection angles and the measured redshifts are found to be in good agreement with expectations from a model based on an elliptical , shallower - than - isothermal , mass distribution and the standard cosmological parameters .",
    "in a future paper ( ofek et al . 2005 , in preparation ) , we will investigate what regions of model parameter space can be excluded by the data , in terms of both the cluster mass distribution and the underlying cosmology , the latter dictating the ratios of angular diameter distances .",
    "the quality of the strong lensing constraints available for this cluster should help to break degeneracies between the parameterization of the cluster mass distribution and the cosmological world model .",
    "the high redshift of this cluster lens may also help to reduce uncertainties caused by large scale structure along the line - of - sight ( dalal et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we will also investigate the possibility that the mass associated with some of the lensed galaxies ( e.g. , the quasar host galaxy ) contributes to the lensing signal observed in more galaxies .",
    "if such a direct geometric measurement of cosmological parameters to a competitive accuracy is feasible , it will apply to a redshift range intermediate to those based on measurements of type - ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background .",
    "furthermore , a lensing - based measurement will sample the @xmath49  @xmath50 parameter plane at an angle almost parallel to @xmath50 and is therefore complementary to the two other methods .",
    "deeper , multi - wavelength imaging of sdss  j1004 + 4112 has been approved , using hst / acs , hst / nicmos , and the spitzer space telescope .",
    "these data will likely reveal additional sets of multiply imaged galaxies , perhaps at even higher redshifts , as well as provide reasonably accurate photometric redshifts , beyond the reach of spectroscopy .",
    "weak lensing measurements will also be feasible . together with the strong lensing information , we will then attempt to tighten considerably the lens model and to estimate cosmological parameters based on this uniquely useful lens .",
