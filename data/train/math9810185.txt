    "it is well known that every classical knot @xmath0 ( knotted circle in @xmath1 ) bounds a compact orientable surface , known as a _ seifert surface _ for the knot .",
    "a seifert surface @xmath2 of minimal genus ( among all seifert surfaces for the given knot @xmath0 ) is called _ minimal _ , and satisfies the following property : the inclusion - induced map @xmath3 is injective .    for a higher dimensional knot , or more generally a knotted ( closed , orientable ) @xmath4manifold @xmath5 in @xmath6 , a _",

    "a seifert manifold @xmath8 for @xmath5 is defined to be _ minimal _ if the inclusion - induced map @xmath10 is injective . in general ,",
    "any @xmath5 will always admit seifert manifolds , but not necessarily minimal seifert manifolds .",
    "for example , silver @xcite has shown that , for any @xmath11 , there exist @xmath4knots in @xmath6 with no minimal seifert manifolds , and maeda @xcite has constructed , for all @xmath12 , a knotted surface of genus @xmath13 in @xmath14 that has no minimal seifert manifold .",
    "further examples of knotted tori in @xmath14 without minimal seifert manifolds are constructed by silver @xcite .",
    "a theorem of silver @xcite says that , for @xmath11 , a knotted @xmath4sphere @xmath15 in @xmath6 has a minimal seifert manifold if and only if its group @xmath16 can be expressed as an hnn extension with a _",
    "finitely presented _ base group .",
    "( it is standard that any higher knot group can be expressed as an hnn extension with a _ finitely generated _ base group . )    as silver remarks , the proof of his theorem does not extend to the case @xmath17 .",
    "however , it remains a _ necessary _",
    "condition for the existence of a minimal seifert manifold that the group be an hnn extension with finitely presented base group .",
    "this applies also to knotted @xmath4manifolds in @xmath6 , a fact which is used implicitly by maeda in the result mentioned above .",
    "it remains an open question whether every 2knot in @xmath14 has a minimal seifert manifold .",
    "this seems unlikely , however .",
    "for example hillman @xcite , p. 139",
    "shows that , provided the 3dimensional poincar conjecture holds , there is an infinite family of distinct 2knots , all with the same group @xmath18 , such that the commutator subgroup of @xmath18 is finite of order 3 ; and at most one of these knots can admit a minimal seifert manifold .    in the present article we consider the case of higher dimensional _ ribbon knots _ , for which the existence of minimal seifert manifolds is also an open question .",
    "indeed , as we shall point out in the next section , higher ribbon knot groups are special cases of _ knot - like groups _ , in the sense of rapaport @xcite , and silver @xcite has conjectured that every finitely generated hnn base for a knot - like group is finitely presented .",
    "it would therefore follow from silver s conjecture ( and his theorem ) that every higher ribbon knot has a minimal seifert manifold .",
    "now any higher ribbon knot group has a wirtinger - like presentation that can be encoded in the form of a _ labelled oriented tree _ ( lot ) @xcite .",
    "indeed the lot encodes not only a presentation for the knot group , but the complete homotopy type of the knot complement . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , if the diameter of the tree is at most 3 , then the group is locally indicable , and using this that the 2complex model of the associated wirtinger presentation is aspherical . a shorter proof of this fact is given in @xcite , where it is shown that the presentation is in fact diagrammatically aspherical .",
    "in the present paper , we show that , under the same hypothesis on the diameter of the tree , the group is an hnn extension with finitely presented base group , and hence that the higher ribbon knot has a minimal seifert manifold .",
