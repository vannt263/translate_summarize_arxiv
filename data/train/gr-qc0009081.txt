    "the doomsday argument was introduced by carter @xcite and leslie @xcite , and independently in somewhat different form by gott @xcite and also by nielsen @xcite .",
    "the general argument in the carter - leslie form runs as follows : there is some possibility that the human race will last for a very long time and grow to huge numbers . in that case , we have been born in the first tiny fraction of all humans , which would be very surprising . on the other hand",
    ", there is also some possibility that the human race will die out before too long due to some disaster ( nuclear war , asteroid impact , etc . ) . in that case , we have been born roughly in the middle of all humans .",
    "( about 10% of humans ever born are alive today , so even if the human race were to end tomorrow , the average person alive today would just be in the last 10% . )",
    "this , claim carter and leslie , gives us reason to increase our estimates that the race will end before too long , making us typical , rather than going on a very long time , making us unusual .",
    "the underlying idea is formalized by bostrom @xcite as the `` self - sampling assumption '' :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ every observer should reason as if they were a random sample drawn from the set of all observers . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this is essentially vilenkin s `` principle of mediocrity '' @xcite applied to individual observers rather than civilizations . to derive the doomsday conclusion , according to leslie and bostrom , one proceeds as follows @xcite .",
    "something like 60 billion people have been born so far .",
    "suppose for simplicity that there are only two possibilities : either the race will die out soon , so that the total number of humans ever to be born is 200 billion , or it will last much longer so that the total number is 200 trillion .",
    "we will call the hypotheses of a short- or long - lived race @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "suppose that before you take into account the doomsday argument , you think that the chances of these two alternatives are @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "now you take into account the fact that you are the @xmath4th human to be born , with @xmath5 .",
    "the probabilities of @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be multiplied by the chance that your birth rank would have been @xmath4 in each case , which we will denote @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ranges over @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus the chance of each alternative , taking into account @xmath4 , is p ( a|n)p ( n|a)(a ) . including the normalization factor",
    ", you find that the probability that the human race will be short - lived is now [ eqn : bayes ] p ( s|n ) = p ( n|s ) ( s)p ( n|s ) ( s ) + p ( n|l ) ( l ) , which is just bayes s rule .",
    "the chance to have a particular birth rank is inversely proportional to the total number of humans to ever exist , so @xmath8 and p ( s|n ) = ( s)(s ) + 10 ^ -3 ( l ) unless you started with @xmath9 or less , you will find that the chance of a short - lived race is nearly 1 .",
    "gott @xcite makes a similar claim about the length of time for which the human race will exist , based on the `` delta @xmath10 argument '' .",
    "if a phenomenon exists for certain period of time @xmath11 , then we should expect ourselves to be observing it at a random time during its life .",
    "thus , for example , the chance that we see the phenomenon in the first or last 2.5% of its life is 0.05 .",
    "gott argues from this that if we know the amount of time @xmath12 for which the phenomenon has existed , then we can conclude that there is a 95% chance that the total lifetime will be such as to make 0.025 t < which reproduces gott s predictions .",
    "unfortunately , there are still two problems .",
    "the first is that gott s prior is not reasonable for any ordinary phenomenon .",
    "for one thing , it can not be normalized , and even if one does nt consider this a technical difficulty , it means that the chance of @xmath11 being in any given finite interval is zero .",
    "even if we adopt gott s suggestion to establish cutoffs at some tiny and some huge lifetime ( e.g. , @xcite recommends the upper limit @xmath13 years ) , the prior chance of any reasonably sized interval is infinitesimal .",
    "for example , gott applied his principle to the berlin wall , built in 1961 and observed by gott in 1969 .",
    "would it be reasonable to use the `` vague prior '' here ? to check this",
    "we can ask what would be a reasonable expectation for the lifetime of the wall at the time that it was built , and thus when no `` past lifetime '' information was available .",
    "how would you have estimated the chance that it would last more than a year and less than 100 years ?",
    "more than a year and less than 100,000 years ?",
    "if you think that either chance is nonzero , then you do nt believe in the vague prior .",
    "( in the case with the cutoff , there would be 5,000,000 factors of 10 in the range of possible durations , so the chance to be between 1 and @xmath14 years is @xmath15 . )    the second problem @xcite is that gott has neglected the fact that a long - lived phenomenon is more likely to be presently ongoing , and thus to be observed , than one which is short - lived . thus if @xmath16 is the probability that a phenomenon of the class under consideration chosen randomly from among all such phenomenon ever to exist has lifetime @xmath11 , then the probability that a phenomenon chosen from all those currently existing has this lifetime is [ eqn : anthropicfactor ] p _",
    "( t)t(t ) .",
    "following @xcite , we call this the anthropic factor . its effect is to cancel the factor due to @xmath17 to give [ eqn : gottnull ] p ( t| ) thus we do not learn anything new from knowing the past lifetime , other than that the total lifetime must be at least as large as what we have observed .",
    "our judgment of the longevity of the phenomenon is still what we get from the prior probability , i.e. from our analysis of other information we may have about its lifetime .",
    "the anthropic factor of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : anthropicfactor ] ) is very much like the argument of previous sections that an observer is more likely to observe a world with many observers than one with few , and the cancelation that leads to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gottnull ] ) is very much like the cancelation that leads to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : null ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "when one takes the relevant principle into account , one finds that the conditional probability based on one s observations is just the prior probability .",
    "however , in the present case there is no need to resort to complex argumentation to justify the use of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : anthropicfactor ] ) . for a simple example",
    ", we can consider the case of radioactive decay @xcite , where the prior is known .",
    "consider nuclei of some radioactive element with lifetime @xmath18 .",
    "each such nucleus will live for sometime @xmath11 after the time at which it is created , and the distribution of @xmath11 is ( t)e^-t/. now suppose that we find such a nucleus lying about our laboratory , and somehow we re able to trace its history and learn its @xmath12 . now by gott s argument , we should think that its total lifetime is distributed as p ( t ) e^-t/ t > , which is not correct . including the anthropic factor",
    "gives the correct answer p ( t)e^-t/ t > .",
    "thus in an elementary case , we see that it is correct to include the extra factor , and thus that no `` extra '' information can be derived from considering the past lifetime .",
    "gott made many predictions by applying his principle , and many of them appeared to be confirmed .",
    "if his principle was wrong , why did his predictions turn out so well ?",
    "one reason is that using an unreasonable prior probability and not including the anthropic factor cancel each other to some degree .",
    "it s hard to know what would be a reasonable prior probability for examples like the berlin wall , but gott also studied the lifetimes of broadway and off - broadway plays and musicals , and in this case we have a large dataset and can do statistics .",
    "i analyzed all the broadway shows listed in the internet theatre database ( www.theatredb.com ) that opened between 6/1/70 and 5/30/90 to determine their running time .",
    "the data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shows ] .",
    "the data points are the percentage of shows whose running time ( number of days counting both opening and closing days ) is within the given number of days .",
    "thus the first data point is the number of shows running only one day , the next is those running two or three days , and so on .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : shows ] that the actual distribution does not fit gott s prior very well at all . the `` vague prior '' , eq.([eqn : gottprior ] ) , would give equal numbers of events in each interval , and thus a flat distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : shows ] .",
    "instead , there is a peak around 50100 days , and a sharp decline after that .",
    "however , for durations after the peak , and excluding a few very long duration shows , the number of shows in a logarithmic interval is well fit by the curve @xmath19 , shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : shows ] .",
    "this is close to @xmath20 , which yields eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gott2 ] ) once one properly takes account of the anthropic factor , and thus reproduces gott s calculations @xcite .",
    "this explains some of gott s successes in predicting the longevity of long - lived shows .",
    "what about shows with short @xmath12 ?",
    "it s clear that gott underpredicts their duration .",
    "for example , gott gives a show which has been open 44 days a 97.5% chance of closing within @xmath21 days , but from the 20 years of data described above , this chance is only 78% . however , very few of gott s sample had been showing for such low periods of time , so the number of opportunities for him to make such an error was small .",
    "what about the future of humanity ?",
    "gott claims that since @xmath22 people have been born so far , the number of humans yet to be born is between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and thus the current birthrate is unlikely to continue for more than 19,000 years .",
    "this argument , however , neglects the `` anthropic '' factor , and uses the `` vague prior '' .",
    "if we do the calculation correctly , we just reproduce the prior probability , and so the issue is to make our best estimation of our probable survival .",
    "one could debate this estimate at length , but it is clear that it is not the `` vague prior '' , since there is obviously some chance of our species perishing in the near future . in fact , it seems that the previous lifetime of our species is essentially irrelevant to many of the possible causes of our destruction . it does nt really matter how long it took and how many people lived and died before we achieved the technology to destroy ourselves .",
    "the danger is at the present time when we have the ability to destroy our species but lack good safeguards that would prevent us from doing so .",
    "moreover , it seems as though a sensible estimation of our chances is bimodal .",
    "there is a nonzero chance that we will become extinct or lose our technological abilities in the relatively near future .",
    "but if this does not happen , if it is likely that we will colonize the galaxy , and then our chances of surviving a very long time are quite high .",
    "thus a sensible distribution for the lifetime of humanity or the number of people who will ever be born is not smooth or monotonic .",
    "leslie @xcite gives the following example about the probability of theories that yield different numbers of observers .",
    "marochnik @xcite suggested a theory in which planets ( and thus observers ) occur only around stars near corotation ( the distance from the center of the galaxy at which the individual stars orbit with the angular velocity of the spiral arm pattern ) .",
    "suppose ( to strengthen the argument ) that this suggestion was made before our sun s position was known , and then it was discovered that it was quite close to corotation .",
    "surely this should be viewed as important support for marochnik s theory .    on the other hand",
    ", leslie argues , if we give greater probability to universes with more observers ( the `` self - indication assumption ''  sia ) , the chance of being here at corotation is no larger in this theory than in one in which planets were common throughout the galaxy .",
    "thus the theory that planets are everywhere and the theory that planets are only here give the same probability for us to be where we are .",
    "it appears that in fact the evidence does not lead us to prefer the marochnik theory .",
    "leslie rejects this consequence and claims that it shows that sia is wrong .",
    "what has happened here ?",
    "is it really true that accepting sia means that we have no support for marochnik s theory , even though it has successfully predicted our position in the galaxy ?",
    "that s not quite right",
    ". however you look at it , you should agree that you have a much better reason to believe this theory after the observation than before .",
    "the issue is how likely this theory was in advance of observation .",
    "if you feel that in advance of observation , the theory was wildly unlikely , then you can feel even though the evidence has made it much more likely , that it is still not an especially well - supported theory .",
    "the reason to feel that it is a priori unlikely , of course , is that it leads to a very small number of observers , as opposed to the theory in which planets are common everywhere .",
    "( you could also feel that this theory is unlikely , in advance of observation , because of the possibility that it will immediately be ruled out by finding that we are in a place where no planets should have been . )",
    "let s consider instead , for a moment , a problem about different galaxies instead of different theories .",
    "suppose that some galaxies have planets around every star , while others have planets only in a special place .",
    "once we have learned this , we should think it highly likely that our galaxy is one with planets everywhere .",
    "however when we later find that we ourselves live in the special place where all galaxies have planets , then we should feel no preference about which type of galaxy we have",
    ". it would not be right to say that it s more likely that we are in a few - planet galaxy because that would `` explain '' or `` correctly predict '' our position in our galaxy .",
    "half the planets in our position are in few - planet galaxies , so we should think the chance that we are one of those is 1/2 .    now consider an intermediate case where the number of planets depends on some other parameter of cosmology .",
    "for example , consider a situation where you think that the hot dark matter ( hdm ) and cold dark matter ( cdm ) theories of cosmology are equally likely .",
    "then suppose you find out that cdm would lead to planets around every star , while hdm would lead to planets only in a special place .",
    "at this point , i think you should consider the cdm theory much more likely to be correct , because it predicts many observers , while the hdm theory predicts few .",
    "if now you find that we are in fact in the special place where both theories predict planets , you should return to thinking that the two theories are equally likely , just as in the previous case .",
    "the number of civilizations finding themselves in the position which we find ourselves is the same in the two theories , so we have no reason to prefer one over the other .",
    "now let us return to the marochnik case .",
    "suppose that _ before considering the effect on the number of observers or measuring our position in the galaxy _ you think that the marochnik theory and the planets - everywhere theory are equally credible .",
    "then , i claim , when you take account of the differing number of observers , you should think that the planets - everywhere theory is far more likely , and when you find our position in the galaxy is as marochnik predicted , you should go back to finding the theories equally likely .",
    "i realize that it is quite counterintuitive that one should not believe this theory when it has made a correct prediction , but i think the situation is as in the model above , where the idea that we are in a few - planet galaxy correctly `` predicts '' our location , but that does not make it more probable that we are in fact in the few - planet galaxy .",
    "bostrom @xcite gives a related example .",
    "suppose that we are certain that one of two cosmological theories is correct , but do nt have a strong preference between them .",
    "both predict finite universes with contents similar to ours , but one theory predicts a universe a trillion times larger than the other .",
    "physicists would like to do an experiment which will determine which theory is the correct one , but the `` presumptuous philosopher '' explains that this is unnecessary .",
    "since one theory has a trillion times more observers than the other , we already know that that theory is a trillion times more likely .",
    "is this in fact an argument against the self - indication assumption , or should we just accept that the presumptuous philosopher is correct ? as above , we can consider the case of a single agreed - upon theory that includes a large number of universes , some a trillion times larger than others , and we wanted to know which type of universe we were in .",
    "then the presumptuous philosopher would be right that the chance of being in a small universe is infinitesimal .",
    "it seems to me that , from the arguments of this paper , the presumptuous philosopher is also correct in the original scenario , as long as we feel that the likelihoods of the two theories are roughly equal before one considers the effect on the number of observers .",
    "however , one should give at least some consideration to the idea that a theory which involves a very large number is less likely to be correct than one which does not .",
    "for example , suppose i have a crazy theory that each planet actually has @xmath25 copies of itself on `` other planes '' .",
    "suppose that i ( as cranks often do ) believe this theory in spite of the fact that every reputable scientist thinks it is garbage .",
    "i could argue that my theory is very likely to be correct , because the chance that every reputable scientist is independently wrong is clearly more than 1 in @xmath25 . to avoid this conclusion",
    ", one must say that the a priori chance that my theory was right was less than 1 in @xmath25 .",
    "it seems hard to have such fantastic confidence that a theory is wrong , but if we do nt allow that we will be prey to the argument above .",
    "one might say that this really just shows the strange consequences of accepting sia .",
    "however , similar scenarios exist without any dependence on the number of observers .",
    "for example , suppose a stranger comes up to you with the claim that if you give him a dollar today he will give you $ 10 tomorrow .",
    "presumably you wo nt give him the dollar , which shows ( if you are maximizing your expectation ) that you think the chance he will come through as he says is less than 10% .",
    "on the other hand , it would be strange to claim that the chance is less than one in a million , since sometimes people making statements like this are honest . at this level",
    "you might even consider the possibility that your whole understanding of the world has one chance in a million to be very wrong , and so you ca nt trust your expectation that you wo nt be paid to this level .",
    "nevertheless , if the payoff is raised to $ 10 million , you still wo nt give the dollar , which shows that now you think the chance for a payback is in fact less than 1 in 10 million . in order to not have a proposed payback large enough to deprive you of your money",
    ", you must think that the likelihood of getting paid decreases at least inversely with the proposed payback .",
    "applying this to cosmology , it is possible that one should think that a theory involving a very large universe is unlikely in proportion to the size of the universe it proposes . in this case , the presumptuous philosopher is wrong , because the tiny a priori probability for the theory with the larger universe cancels its larger number of observers .",
    "the theories must then compete on their merits .",
    "a theory of quantum cosmology gives an initial wave function for the universe ( although there is disagreement about what this wave function should be @xcite ) .",
    "quantum mechanical evolution should then take the initial wave function and evolve it up to the present time .",
    "the result will be a huge superposition of possible outcomes . from this wave function",
    "we need to determine what we should expect to observe .",
    "presumably , most sectors of this wave function will describe conditions not suited to the existence of observers , so we must take into account anthropic considerations @xcite .    with the treatment that i have advocated here , the procedure is straightforward .",
    "we look at all observers existing in all sectors of the wave function , and assume that we are randomly situated among all those observers , with probabilities given by the squared magnitudes of the coefficients in the wave function .",
    "this gives us the probability distribution for what we should expect to observe .",
    "if we have already made some observations , and wish to predict the outcome of others , then we should simply discard all observers whose observations conflict with what we have seen and consider the distribution among those observers remaining .",
    "on the other hand , if we follow leslie and bostrom s analysis , then we will have the problem of section [ sec : qm - interpretation ] above , and our conclusions will depend on our interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "if we use the copenhagen interpretation , then sectors of the wave function should be interpreted as classical probabilistic alternatives .",
    "then , if we follow leslie and bostrom , we should expect that we are typical observers in a typical sector of the wave function , which is not the same thing as the above .",
    "sectors with small numbers of observers are overrepresented in this procedure . if , on the other hand , we use the multiple worlds interpretation , then all possible observers actually exist , and we should find ourselves to be typical among them .",
    "the fact that leslie and bostrom s treatment yields ambiguous predictions argues against its use in evaluating theories of quantum cosmology .",
    "when you learn new information , you should update the probabilities you assign to various hypotheses , based on the new information .",
    "you should now favor hypotheses that made the new data seem likely over those that made it seem unusual .",
    "thus whatever chance you assign to the possibility that the human race will end fairly shortly , you should increase it when you take into account the position in which you find yourself . knowing that you are among the first 70 billion people to exist",
    "gives you reason to prefer theories in which the total number of people ever to exist is not much larger than 70 billion .",
    "this is the doomsday argument @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , i have argued here that when you take into account the fact that you exist at all , you should update your probabilities in precisely the inverse manner , finding it more likely to be in a race with a larger total number of individuals .",
    "this effect follows if one considers the case where there might be a large number or might be a small number of people as analogous to the case where there are a large number of people of one kind and a small number of another .",
    "this effect exactly cancels the effect of taking into account your position in the species .",
    "the result of including both these effects is the same as the result of including neither .",
    "you judge the probability of early doom to be whatever you judge it to be from considering the actual processes that might put an end to humanity .",
    "you get no other information from arguments about your existence and when you were born .",
    "this agrees with our intuition that the chance of an event ( e.g. , the earth being hit by an asteroid ) should not depend on the event s consequences ( e.g. , humanity being wiped out ) .    in the case of gott s",
    "argument , the situation is clear .",
    "one must include the fact that longer - lived phenomena are more likely to be currently ongoing to get sensible predictions @xcite .",
    "once one does so , gott s argument does not change the prior probability distribution for the longevity of a phenomenon .    in the case of the carter - leslie argument , the situation is not as clear as that .",
    "however , i have given a number of arguments that we should in fact treat universes with longer - lived human races as more likely for that reason , until we take account of our position in the species .",
    "with this effect included , there is no force in the doomsday argument .",
    "nevertheless , i would not want anyone to become unconcerned with the future of humanity as a result of the present paper .",
    "serious dangers do face us , and we should work to minimize them , even if they are no larger than one would at first think .",
    "i would like to thank alex vilenkin for stimulating my interest in this problem , and judy anderson , j. j. blanco - pillado , allen everett , larry ford , jaume garriga , xavier siemens , alex vilenkin , and valerie white for useful conversations .",
