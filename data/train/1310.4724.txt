    "a simple computation shows that @xmath649 for @xmath650 , i.e. , @xmath651 is an integral of motion .",
    "however when @xmath652 , we have @xmath653 , and @xmath79 becomes a lyapunov function for @xmath123 .",
    "now , since the sequence of the vertices visited by an orbit contained in a set @xmath654 is completely determined by @xmath655 , it is not difficult to show that the map @xmath106 is asymptotically periodic for every @xmath656 .",
    "the proof that the dissipative outer billiards about the equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon are both asymptotically periodic for @xmath637 is analogous .",
    "the lyapunov function for both billiards is defined as for the square , but with @xmath657 for the equilateral triangle , and with @xmath658 for the hexagon , where @xmath659 + \\left[\\frac{y}{2}\\right]+\\left[\\frac{\\left|x\\pm y\\right|+1}{2}\\right].\\ ] ]    to complete this remark , we observe that while the previous argument proves the asymptotic periodicity for the dissipative outer billiards considered , it does not give a complete description of the bifurcations of the @xmath121-limit set , for which the analysis described in sections  [ triangle ] and [ square ] or an alternative one is still required .",
    "according to bruin and deane  @xcite , almost every piecewise contraction is asymptotically periodic .",
    "this result , however , does not apply to polygonal dissipative outer billiards .",
    "the reason is that different polygons generate different partitions of the domain of definition of the corresponding outer billiard map , whereas in bruin and deane s setting , the partition is fixed a priori for the entire family of piecewise contractions .",
    "not every dissipative outer polygonal billiard is asymptotically periodic .",
    "there exist quadrilaterals whose dissipative outer billiard has a cantor set lying on the singular set , which attracts nearby points  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath662 be the closed ball associated to @xmath106 defined in subsection  [ su : forward ] .",
    "we say that the _ singular set of @xmath123 stabilizes _ if there exists an integer @xmath107 such that @xmath663 .",
    "if the singular set of @xmath123 stabilizes then there exists an integer @xmath107 such that the map @xmath664 is continuous on each connected component of @xmath665 for every @xmath666 . since @xmath665 has finitely many such components , say @xmath667 , and the map @xmath123 contracts uniformly every @xmath668 into some @xmath669 , we conclude that @xmath124 is finite .",
    "we can not claim that every element of @xmath670 in the previous proposition is a periodic orbit , because some of these elements may belong to the singular set of @xmath106 .",
    "however , such an element does generate a periodic orbit for a proper extension of @xmath106 up to @xmath105 ( degenerate periodic orbit ) .",
    "we believe that degenerate periodic orbits exist only in very specific circumstances , for example at the bifurcation of a true periodic orbit .",
    "even though the stabilization of the singular set is not strictly speaking a sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability , it still provides a useful criterion for investigating asymptotic periodicity that can be effectively implemented numerically .",
    "we wrote a script in _",
    "mathematica _ that generates the singular sets of any order of a polygonal outer billiard , and checks whether they stabilize .",
    "when the singular set stabilizes at some order @xmath113 , the script attributes a color to the connected components of @xmath665 .",
    "the union of all regions of the same color gives the basin of attraction in @xmath671 of a single attracting periodic orbit .",
    "to test numerically conjecture  [ conj : regular ] , we run our code with different regular @xmath23-gons with @xmath672 , and different contraction rates @xmath673 . as the number of sides of the polygon increases or the contraction rates get closer to @xmath674 , the code execution time increases drastically .",
    "all experiments showed that the singular set stabilizes , in agreement with our conjecture .",
    "figs  [ fig : pentagon]-[fig : octnon ] show some snapshots of our numerical experiments . in these figures ,",
    "the polygon @xmath19 is located at the center in white color .",
    "the contraction rates @xmath675 are all equal to @xmath162 .",
    "the set @xmath127 surrounds @xmath18 , and the lines forming the stabilized singular set @xmath676 are drawn in black color .",
    "the domains of continuity of @xmath677 are the polygonal regions cut by @xmath676 .",
    "the different colors indicate the basins of attraction of different periodic orbits .",
    "the basins of attractions of the periodic orbits in the dissipative outer billiard about the pentagon can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pentagon ] : the four colors correspond to the basins of attractions of four distinct attracting periodic orbits .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pentagon](b ) , the blue regions form the basin of attraction of the fagnano orbit . in the figure",
    ", there is also another periodic orbit of period five , but winding around the pentagon twice .",
    "this orbit is located on the largest polygonal regions in green color .",
    "the basin of attraction of a period orbit of period @xmath678 is plotted in brown color . finally , the tiny regions in pink color form the basin of attraction of a period orbit of period @xmath679 .            since @xmath686 we can write @xmath687 where @xmath688 when @xmath689 , we have @xmath690 , and so @xmath691 . now , let @xmath692 . by descartes rule of signs",
