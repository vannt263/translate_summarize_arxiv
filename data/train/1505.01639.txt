    "( log scale ) , for a well defined particle velocity . for definiteness",
    "the following parameters ( realistic for an experiment with @xmath163 antiprotons ) were chosen @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "the calculated talbot length for this period and energy is @xmath188 .",
    "note that the typical contrast peaks disappear when @xmath189 : this corresponds to a classical behavior of the particles.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    another advantage of talbot - lau configuration is its robustness with respect to external stray fields .",
    "suppose for example that the interferometer is subjected to uniform external electric and magnetic fields which exerts a force @xmath190 on the charged particles : this force will be negligible if the corresponding deviation from a straight trajectory is smaller than the typical size of the finest structure in the observable pattern .",
    "let us call this quantity @xmath191 , and introduce the flight time of the particle @xmath192 .",
    "using the identity @xmath193 , we obtain the following relation : @xmath194 where for a talbot - lau geometry @xmath195 .",
    "if we set @xmath196 , we have : @xmath197 that is independent of the particle energy .",
    "furthermore , from the lorentz force @xmath198 one can deduce the critical values of the involved electric and magnetic fields by the simple relations @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the case of fraunhofer interferometry ( far field ) a similar calculation with @xmath201 leads to a critical force @xmath202 which is thus affected by the particle energy .",
    "overall , the talbot - lau geometry has several advantages which are especially relevant for anti - matter interferometry . in particular",
    ", it allows to minimize the total length of the apparatus , a crucial requirement for decaying ps , and to employ a larger source with weak coherence requirements , significantly increasing the particle flux .",
    "we now present a realistic estimate of the expected contrast signal in an @xmath139 experiment , following the experimental methodology outlined in this section ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : threegrating ] and [ fig : visibilityspeed ] ) .",
    "we assume that the particle mean energy @xmath203 can be tuned between @xmath204 and @xmath205 ( reasonable for current continuous @xmath139 beams ) with a narrow gaussian energy distribution ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "by varying the energy we scan the ratio @xmath182 , where the talbot length reads : @xmath207 a contrast peak is expected around @xmath208 .",
    "the above formula makes it clear that to scan this region there are specific complications related to each choice of which parameter to vary : the energy is bounded by technical constraints and furthermore provides a sub - linear scaling , whereas the grating distance can be varied arbitrarily .",
    "there are however technical complications in physically moving an apparatus sensitive to alignment over considerable lengths .",
    "we recall that in this configuration @xmath6 sets the periodicity of the interference pattern , which should be larger than the detector resolution .",
    "however as evident from ( [ eqn : rapportoproposal ] ) , the talbot length scales quadratically with @xmath6 .",
    "thus it rapidly becomes very large , and too long an apparatus poses additional challenges related both to grating alignment and shielding of a larger region from stray fields .",
    "we set @xmath209 corresponding to a talbot length @xmath210 at the median energy of the considered energy range , namely @xmath211 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : critfield ] ) we obtain @xmath212 and @xmath213 for the maximum tolerable electric and magnetic field , respectively , evaluated at a @xmath214 , which corresponds to the worst scenario .",
    "the maximum magnetic field is particularly critical , as the requirement is smaller than the natural magnetic field of the earth , however considering that experiments with electrons and similar length scales involved have been successfully carried out @xcite , we believe that an appropriate mu - metal based shielding will be enough to circumvent the problem",
    ". moreover an uniform constant magnetic field will only rigidly shift the pattern in space @xcite , in fact the above limits indicate the maximum allowed _ fluctuations _ ( either in time or in space ) of the @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "another problem our theoretical analysis allows to account for is the electrostatic interaction with the grating walls .",
    "first of all we have to set the slit width , and thus the open fraction of the grating ; this is best set at @xmath217 , implying @xmath218 .",
    "higher values could improve the total particle flux minimizing the losses inside the material grating , but will also reduce the contrast due the overlapping diffraction peaks .",
    "we remark that for the gratings to work as true intensity masks , their thickness must be sufficient to stop all the positrons outside the slits . for such low energies few microns of sin@xmath126",
    "will be sufficient .",
    "therefore , assuming these parameters and a small wedge angle @xmath219 , a grating thickness @xmath220 and @xmath214 , equation ( [ eqn : aeff ] ) predicts an effective slit width @xmath221 .",
    "this deviation is very small ( @xmath222 ) , thus the effect will be completely negligible for the considered choice of parameters .    having evaluated the most relevant effects and set the geometry of the apparatus , we can now use eq .",
    "( [ i : bar ] ) to predict the measured contrast modulation @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : proposalconfronto ] , which contains interesting indications .",
    "on the one hand we can see that a particle energy between @xmath204 and @xmath223 is enough to observe a full peak . on the other hand , we see that also a broader energy distribution ( @xmath224  kev or @xmath225  kev in fig .",
    "[ fig : proposalconfronto ] ) still allows for a good visibility of the contrast modulation .",
    ", for the monochromatic case and with a gaussian distribution of increasing @xmath30 centered on @xmath203 .",
    "the total number of slits is set to @xmath186 , sufficiently large to provide realistic results .",
    "see text for more details on the parameters.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "in this paper we reviewed the basic elements of diffraction theory applied to matter - wave interferometry .",
    "in particular , we focus our analysis on the possible issues arising from the use of charged or neutral antimatter particles . to sustain our investigation we also performed monte carlo simulated experiments based on realistic parameters .",
    "in particular , we have considered the effect due to a realistic source ( extended and non - monochromatic ) and the interaction with the grating as well as the influence of stray electromagnetic fields .",
    "we also found that van der waals interactions with the material grating become critical for highly polarizable particle systems . in this scenario",
    "a possible solution could be resorting to light gratings @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the better configuration to carry out matter - wave interferometry with decaying particles is given by the talbot - lau setup also in the presence of a gaussian distribution of the particle energy , which realistically describes the actual @xmath1 and @xmath2 beams . furthermore , exploiting the high resolution capabilities of the antiparticle detectors , such as the nuclear emulsions , we have shown that the typical talbot - lau setup involving three gratings can be reduced to a two - grating configuration which indeed simplifies the experimental implementation .",
    "our analysis paves the way to further investigations in order to design an experiment to demonstrate antimatter - wave interference also in view of possible applications in the emerging field of gravity experiments using antimatter @xcite .",
