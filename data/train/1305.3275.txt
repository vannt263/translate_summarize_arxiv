    "for most of the life of a massive star cluster , two - body relaxation is the dominant physical mechanism driving its evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "that is , the cumulative effects of long - range gravitational interactions between stars act to alter their orbits within the cluster .",
    "these interactions push the cluster toward a state of energy equipartition in which all objects have roughly the same kinetic energy .",
    "consequently , the velocities of the most massive objects decrease , and they accumulate in the central regions of the cluster .",
    "similarly , the velocities of the lowest mass objects increase , and they are subsequently dispersed to wider orbits .",
    "this mechanism , called mass segregation , also contributes to the escape of stars from their host cluster across the tidal boundary , with the probability of ejection increasing with decreasing stellar mass .",
    "therefore , two - body relaxation acts to slowly modify the radial distribution of stellar masses within clusters , and can cause very dynamically evolved clusters to be severely depleted of their low - mass stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "energy equipartition is an idealized state that should arise after the cumulative effects of many long - range interactions . in a real star cluster with a full spectrum of stellar masses ,",
    "however , equipartition may not actually be achievable ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as mentioned , the tendency towards energy equipartition reduces the velocities of the heaviest stars , causing them to sink in to the central cluster regions . here ,",
    "they are re - accelerated by the central cluster potential and gain kinetic energy .",
    "as this process proceeds , it leads to a contraction of the core and subsequently a shorter central relaxation time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a shorter relaxation time leads to a faster rate of energy transfer from heavier to lighter stars .",
    "eventually , this makes the heaviest stars evolve away from equipartition .",
    "this was first demonstrated by @xcite using analytic techniques and a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "@xcite adopted a two - component system with masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 ) , forming sub - systems with total masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 . provided that @xmath6 , spitzer derived the conditional requirement for a cluster to achieve energy equipartition in equilibrium . based on this ,",
    "spitzer argued that energy equipartition could not be achieved in a cluster with a realistic mass spectrum , since there should always be enough mass in the heavier species for it to form a sub - system in the central cluster regions that decouples dynamically from the lighter species .",
    "this is commonly called the spitzer instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "a particularly compelling example of the spitzer instability involves stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ) in globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "@xcite first argued that bhs formed from the most massive stars should rapidly segregate into the core where they decouple dynamically from the rest of the cluster to form a distinct sub - system .",
    "three - body scattering events then lead to the formation of bh - bh binaries , which in turn encounter other bhs and bh - bh binaries .",
    "these 3- and 4-body interactions are sufficiently energetic to eject the bhs from the cluster . in the end",
    ", most bhs are expected to be ejected , leaving only a handful behind .",
    "this picture has recently been challenged in the literature . in particular ,",
    "several authors have argued that the spitzer instability should break down before most bhs are ejected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that the time - scale for all bhs to be ejected could exceed a hubble time in some clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this view is supported by recent claims in the literature that stellar - mass bhs may be present in gcs in surprising numbers . for instance , @xcite recently reported two flat - spectrum radio sources in m22 , which appear to be accreting stellar - mass bhs .",
    "this suggests that this cluster could contain on the order of @xmath7 stellar - mass bhs .",
    "if bhs were indeed efficiently dynamically ejected , this , in turn , would suggest that a more substantial population of bhs once existed in m22 , and likely other gcs as well .",
    "the emerging picture for the formation of massive gcs involves multiple episodes of star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this context ,",
    "@xcite recently considered the implications of the mass growth of bhs formed from massive progenitors belonging to the first generation due to accretion from the interstellar medium .",
    "the authors argued that , in principle , bhs could deplete a significant fraction of the available gas reservoir within @xmath8 years .",
    "if bhs were indeed to accrete efficiently from the ism , they should not only grow in mass , but their velocities should also decrease due to conservation of momentum .",
    "this should preferentially accelerate the process of mass segregation for the bhs , causing them to rapidly accumulate in the central regions of the cluster if they did not form there in the first place .",
    "this could accelerate the dynamical decoupling of the bh sub - population from the rest of the system , and hence the phase of dynamical bh ejections due to the spitzer instability .    in this paper ,",
    "we consider how accretion from the interstellar medium affects the rate of mass segregation in a star cluster .",
    "we are especially interested in the implications for bhs in primordial gcs .",
    "thus , we re - visit spitzer s two - component model to derive an accretion - modified relaxation time .",
    "we argue that the rate of mass segregation should be affected by accretion in the following way .",
    "first , assuming the accretion rate increases with the accretor mass , accretion acts to increase the range of any initial mass spectrum , driving the heaviest members to higher masses the fastest .",
    "second , accretion acts to reduce the velocities of the accretors due to conservation of momentum , and it is the heaviest members whose velocities are reduced the fastest .",
    "both of these effects exacerbate the spitzer instability , and should accelerate the rate of mass segregation in a primordial star cluster .    in order to better quantify this qualitative picture",
    ", we present our adapted version of spitzer s two - component model in section  [ method ] .",
    "specifically , we derive an accretion - modified relaxation time , as well as the critical accretion rate at which the rates of mass segregation due to both two - body relaxation and accretion are equal .",
    "we present our results in section  [ results ] for several different assumptions regarding the total cluster mass and accretion rate . in section  [ discussion ] , we discuss the implications of our results for both star formation and stellar remnants in primordial globular clusters . we summarize our results in section  [ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we present our analytic derivation of an accretion - modified relaxation time for a two - component model star cluster , and derive the critical accretion rate required for the mass segregation timescales due to two - body relaxation and accretion to be equal .",
    "we begin by summarizing briefly the relevant background related to both two - body relaxation and accretion .",
    "consider a two - component model for a star cluster with component masses @xmath9 and @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 .",
    "the populations for these two species have total masses @xmath12 and @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "we let @xmath15 denote the initial mean square speed of _ both _ species , since at birth the cluster is not in a state of energy equipartition .",
    "the e - folding time for the tendency to equipartition bears a striking resemblance to the relaxation time @xcite .",
    "thus , to order of magnitude , the relaxation time can be approximated by calculating the time required for the mean square speed of the heavier species to fall from @xmath15 to a value @xmath16 .",
    "if the potential well of the lighter species is modelled using a parabolic profile , then equipartition will lead to the heavier species being confined to a region of size @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the total mass of the heavier species within this region is @xmath12 , whereas that for the lighter species is @xmath18 . at this point",
    ", however , it is not clear whether or not the lighter species remains the dominant mass component in this region .",
    "if not , the heavier species becomes increasingly affected by its own self - gravity , and can decouple dynamically from the remainder of the system .",
    "consequently , it may only be possible to achieve equipartition provided @xcite : @xmath19 this is known as spitzer s criterion .",
    "in general , the half - mass relaxation time approximates the rate of two - body relaxation throughout the entire cluster . in gcs , it ranges from roughly a few hundred million years to the age of the universe or longer , and is approximated by @xcite : @xmath20 = 1.7 \\times 10 ^ 5[r_{\\rm h } [ pc]]^{3/2}n^{1/2}[\\bar{m } [ m_{\\odot}]]^{-1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is once again the half - mass radius , @xmath22 is the total number of stars within @xmath21 , and @xmath0 is the average stellar mass .",
    "we assume that the value of @xmath21 remains constant in time .",
    "this is reasonable since simulations have shown that @xmath21 changes by not more than a factor of a few over the course of a typical cluster s lifetime @xcite . the timescale for mass segregation due to two - body relaxation for an object of mass @xmath23 is then approximately @xcite : @xmath24",
    "a strict theoretical upper limit for the accretion rate is given by the bondi - hoyle limit @xcite .",
    "in this approximation , the accretion is spherically symmetric , and the forces due to gas pressure are insignificant compared to gravitational forces .",
    "the background gas is treated as uniform and either stationary or moving with constant velocity relative to the accretor .",
    "this assumption gives reasonable accretion rates in the low - density , low - angular momentum regime .",
    "that is , provided the properties of the gas are such that the density , velocity , and total angular momentum are low , at least in the vicinity of the accretor , the bondi - hoyle limit approximately describes the true accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for large accretor masses and high gas densities , the bondi - hoyle rate can become extremely high . here , pressure forces could play an important role in reducing the accretion rate .",
    "indeed , this occurs if the outward continuum radiation force balances the inward gravitational force .",
    "this limit , called eddington - limited accretion , gives considerably more modest accretion rates in the high gas density regime @xcite .",
    "the eddington rate should also be much closer to the true accretion rate if the gas contains significant angular momentum , and accretion proceeds mainly via angular momentum re - distribution within a disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in general , theoretical studies have shown that the exact accretion rate can deviate substantially from the idealized cases described by bondi - hoyle and eddington - limited accretion .",
    "for example , when an accretor is radiating at above the eddington luminosity , significant amounts of gas can be expelled at high velocities due to the intense winds that are initiated ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this contributes to a reduction in the overall accretion rate . on the other hand , at very high accretion rates , photon - trapping can occur .",
    "this makes accretion disks radiatively inefficient and provides a means of circumventing the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "numerical studies have also revealed the sensitivity of the accretion rate to small - scale gas dynamics .",
    "recent work by @xcite considered gas accretion onto point masses in a supersonically turbulent medium characterized by background density and velocity distributions that vary in both time and space .",
    "the authors show that in this regime , the accretion rate can either be described by the classical bondi - hoyle approximation , or a vorticity - dominated flow . in the latter case",
    ", the accretion rate can be significantly reduced relative to what is predicted by the bondi - hoyle limit @xcite .",
    "even more recently , @xcite studied the growth and luminosity of bhs in motion with respect to their surrounding medium using two - dimensional axis - symmetric numerical simulations .",
    "the authors show that the accretion rate can actually increase with increasing bh velocity , contrary to the naive predictions of simple analytic theory @xcite .    in summary",
    ", theoretical work has shown that a wide range of accretion rates are possible .",
    "we will use the bondi - hoyle and eddington limits for the accretion rate ( combined with an accretion efficiency parameter ) since these provide two different dependences on the accretor mass .",
    "however , the derivation presented in the subsequent section can be used to model other mass - dependences for the accretion rate as well .",
    "we are interested in the mass segregation timescale due to two - body relaxation for the heavier species in the two - component model described in section  [ relax ] . to first order ,",
    "this is approximated by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the half - mass relaxation time obtained by using the total number of objects @xmath27 and average object mass @xmath28 in equation  [ eqn : t - rh ] .",
    "we calculate the time - dependence for the mass of an object belonging to species @xmath29 as follows .",
    "first , assuming an object of initial mass @xmath30 accretes at a rate @xmath31 for a total time @xmath32 , we have : @xmath33 for the accretion rate , we assume a mass - dependence of the form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are all free parameters . the power - law exponent @xmath37 decides the mass - dependence for the accretion rate .",
    "the accretion coefficent @xmath36 is derived according to the physical assumptions that decide the rate of accretion .",
    "for example , adopting the bondi - hoyle approximation implies @xmath38 , and ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the particle number density , @xmath41 is the sound speed , and @xmath15 is the root - mean - square speed .",
    "similarly , assuming eddington - limited accretion implies @xmath42 , and @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the speed of light , @xmath45 is the accretion yield from unit mass , and @xmath46 is the electron scattering opacity .",
    "we take @xmath47 @xmath48 g@xmath49 , which assumes a hydrogen mass fraction of @xmath50 .",
    "we further adopt @xmath51 , which is reasonable if the accretors are bhs since this parameter quantifies the amount of energy radiated away during accretion .",
    "the accretion efficiency parameter @xmath35 , on the other hand , is left as a free parameter in our model .    in order to solve for the accretor mass as a function of time , equation",
    "[ eqn : mass - time ] can be re - written such that the integral is with respect to mass .",
    "provided @xmath52 , this gives for the mass of an object belonging to species @xmath29 at time @xmath32 : @xmath53 similarly , for @xmath42 , we have : @xmath54 we arrive at the mass segregation timescale due to two - body relaxation for the heavier species by substituting either equation  [ eqn : mass - time2 ] or equation  [ eqn : mass - time3 ] for both species 1 and 2 into equation  [ eqn : tau - seg - time ] .",
    "in addition to two - body relaxation , accretion should also affect the stellar velocities via conservation of momentum . provided the accretion rate increases with increasing accretor mass",
    ", this will reduce the kinetic energy of the heavier species faster than the lighter species , in rough analogy with the effects of two - body relaxation .",
    "thus , accretion - induced changes in the stellar velocities should _ accelerate _ the rate of mass segregation .",
    "we calculate the time needed for accretion to change the velocities of the heavier species from a root - mean - square speed of @xmath15 to a value of @xmath55 .",
    "this corresponds to the time for accretion to affect the velocities of the heavier species by roughly the same amount as is done by two - body relaxation over a single relaxation time .    for a given accretion rate and initial masses ,",
    "we calculate the time needed for the mean square speed of the heavier species to reach a value @xmath56 using conservation of momentum , from an initial value @xmath57 . the time needed for the heavier species to reach equipartition via accretion",
    "can then be written : @xmath58 where the final mass is @xmath59 by conservation of momentum .    substituting @xmath60 into equation  [ eqn : tau - acc ]",
    ", we arrive at the timescale needed for accretion to push the heavier species into approximate equipartition : @xmath61 for @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath42 or eddington - limited accretion , we obtain using equation  [ eqn : mass - time3 ] : @xmath62 we consider accretion rates with a mass - dependence such that @xmath63 , since this includes both bondi - hoyle and eddington - limited accretion , as well as intermediate and even steeper mass accretion rates .",
    "the total rate ( taken to be the inverse of the total mass segregation timescale @xmath64 ) at which the heavier species achieves mass segregation can be written as the sum of the rate of two - body relaxation and the rate at which accretion pushes the heavier species to equipartition .",
    "re - arranging this equation , we arrive at the total accretion - modified mass segregation timescale for the heavier species : @xmath65      to derive the critical accretion rate @xmath66 at which two - body relaxation and accretion drive the mass segregation process at the same rate , we set @xmath67 and solve for @xmath36 as a function of @xmath37 , @xmath35 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath68 .",
    "this gives for @xmath52 : @xmath69    the procedure is similar for @xmath42 , except we use equation  [ eqn : tau - acc3 ] instead of equation  [ eqn : tau - acc2 ] .",
    "this gives for eddington - limited accretion : @xmath70    in section  [ results ] , we will use equation  [ eqn : delta2 ] and equation  [ eqn : delta3 ] in order to study the interplay between our assumptions regarding the gas properties , which affect the accretion rate , and our assumption for the total cluster mass , which determines the rate of two - body relaxation .",
    "given our limited understanding of the precise physics of accretion onto a bh , it is not possible to reliably define a functional form for the accretion efficiency parameter @xmath35 . in principle , any realistic accretion model should include a _ time - dependence _ for @xmath71 . in equations  [ eqn : tau - acc2 ] and  [ eqn : tau - acc3 ] .",
    "] for example , fluctuations in the local gas density due to turbulence , a gradual or even sudden depletion of the available gas reservoir , or dynamical interactions between accreting objects may cause the accretion efficiency to vary over time .",
    "our analysis is easily modified to treat time - dependent accretion rates by substituting an appropriate choice for @xmath71 into either equation  [ eqn : tau - acc2 ] or  [ eqn : tau - acc3 ] , and then solving for @xmath72 .",
    "plausible choices for @xmath71 may either oscillate or decline ( steadily or abruptly ) in time .",
    "the first case , i.e. an oscillating accretion efficiency , is more easily understood , because under these circumstances , our analysis can simply be interpreted as discussing the _ time - averaged _ accretion efficiency parameter .",
    "thus , in the subsequent sections , we assume an oscillating ( or constant ) accretion efficiency parameter , and discuss only the time - averaged value .    for example , the function @xmath73 oscillates between 0 and 2 with a frequency of @xmath74 . in this case , the time - averaged value for @xmath71 is equal to 1 , so that the time - averaged value for @xmath72 remains the same as for a constant @xmath75 .",
    "accretion efficiency parameters that oscillate in time should be suitable to cases where the accretors have alternating `` on '' and `` off '' phases",
    ". this may well be the case with accreting bhs , since the radiation emitted due to accretion can heat the surrounding gas , which in turn decreases the accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the source of energetic photons responsible for heating the gas is turned off , allowing the gas to cool and accretion to re - start in a `` feedback regulated '' loop ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accretion efficiency parameters that decline in time should be appropriate to cases where the available gas reservoir is depleted over time .",
    "this could arise gradually if the gas is used to form stars , or if significant quantities of gas are accreted by bhs .",
    "alternatively , the gas reservoir could be depleted suddenly , e.g. due to , energy injected from supernovae , stellar winds , or winds from accreting compact objects . in either case , equations  [ eqn : tau - acc2 ] and  [ eqn : tau - acc3 ] should include the explicit time - dependence for the accretion efficiency parameter .",
    "this will contribute to an increase in @xmath72 with time , since the decreasing gas mass should translate into a decreasing gas density , and hence accretion rate . in section  [ results ] , we will assume that the amount of gas lost from the system is negligible over the calculated mass segregation timescales , and our interpretation of @xmath35 as a time - independent quantity remains valid .",
    "this is reasonable provided the mass segregation timescales due to accretion are much less than the timescale for gas depletion . as we will show in section  [ results ] , the current picture for the formation of globular clusters and their multiple populations is consistent with this scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we begin by quantifying the relative rates of mass segregation due to two - body relaxation and gas accretion for different model assumptions .",

    "however , accretion also acts to reduce the velocities of the accretors due to conservation of momentum , and this should most strongly impact the most massive objects due once again to the mass - dependence of the accretion rate . this can actually serve to combat the effects of the spitzer instability by inhibiting the most massive objects from decoupling dynamically from the rest of the system once they have segregated to the central regions of the cluster .",
    "clearly , a more sophisticated treatment will be needed in future studies in order to properly quantify these effects and their implications for the spitzer instability , and a cluster s ability to achieve energy equipartition .",
    "we stress that our results depend sensitively on our assumption for the accretion rate , which is poorly constrained , both theoretically and observationally .",
    "indeed , the accretion efficiency parameter @xmath35 adopted in equation  [ eqn : acc - rate ] is needed to account for the many sources of uncertainty in the gas properties , and hence the accretion rate .",
    "for example , our assumption of a uniform , time - independent gas density is an over - simplification .",
    "for one , stellar winds and supernovae could create over- and under - densities in the form of sheets and/or filaments , and the efficiency of these processes should fluctuate in time given the presence of a realistic mass function combined with stellar evolution and the cluster dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these effects could contribute to a reduction in the accretion rate by increasing the relative velocity between the gas and the accretors , or by reducing the gas density along the trajectories of the accretors .",
    "realistic hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation will be needed in order to properly quantify these effects and their implications for the accretion rate .",
    "our results can be used to guide the parameter space relevant to these future studies . in particular , we have placed a lower limit on the minimum accretion rate required for accretion to significantly affect the distribution of stellar velocities on timescales shorter than the relaxation time , as a function of the cluster and gas properties . specifically , the results of our simple model suggest that , for a typical primordial gc , the average accretion rate can not be much less than @xmath92% of the eddington - limited rate , assuming the mass - dependence for the accretion rate is linear",
    ". similarly , for our model assumptions , the average accretion rate can not be much less than @xmath98% of the bondi - hoyle rate if the accretion rate scales with the square of the accretor mass .",
    "we have adopted the same root - mean - square speed for all models , independent of the total cluster mass .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the root - mean - square speed scales as @xmath99 , and @xmath21 itself depends weakly on the total cluster mass .",
    "thus , in total , the root - mean - square speed depends only very weakly on the total cluster mass .",
    "nevertheless , if the accretion rate scales inversely with the velocity of the accretor , as is the case with the bondi - hoyle approximation , then the dependence of the root - mean - square speed on the total cluster mass should contribute to a decrease in the accretion rate with increasing cluster mass .",
    "a proper treatment of this effect is beyond the scope of this paper , however , it should certainly be considered in future studies .",
    "the results presented in this paper are especially relevant for black holes in primordial globular clusters , since they should be the most massive objects in the cluster within a few myrs of its formation .",
    "evidence suggests that there should be a substantial gas reservoir in gcs for the first @xmath90 years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , albeit perhaps intermittently , and that nearly all bhs should form from the most massive cluster members within the first few myrs ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "it follows that the bhs could have on the order of @xmath100 years to accrete gas from the ism .",
    "additionally , since any bhs formed from progenitors more massive than @xmath101 m@xmath78 are only slightly less massive than the progenitors themselves and do not experience natal kicks @xcite , these bhs should have both the shortest mass segregation timescales due to two - body relaxation and the highest accretion rates ( ignoring bh winds and/or compton heating ; see below ) .",
    "the key point is that accretion should act to reduce the mass segregation times of bhs in primordial gcs , and that this effect could be dramatic . beyond this ,",
    "more detailed modeling will be needed to determine the fates of the bhs .",
    "in particular , should the increased rate of mass segregation contribute to accelerating the onset of the hypothesized phase of dynamical bh ejections ? or could the damping effects of accretion be so dramatic that the bhs are driven to merge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if so , the formation of an intermediate - mass bh ( imbh ) could be the inevitable result .",
    "alternatively , it could be that black hole winds are sufficiently powerful to eject the bulk of the gas from the cluster .",
    "another possibility is that the gas in the immediate vicinity of the bhs becomes very hot due to , for example , compton heating @xcite , such that the accretion rate becomes drastically reduced and bh growth is severely limited ?",
    "a better understanding of how the presence of significant quantities of gas modifies the black hole dynamics in a primordial gc could help to constrain the initial cluster conditions .",
    "for example , if massive bhs should inevitably merge in the presence of gas but no imbhs are observed in present - day gcs , does this necessarily imply that the bhs never formed in the first place ?",
    "if so , this would suggest that stars with masses @xmath102 m@xmath78 must have been rare",
    ". this could be the case , for instance , if massive primordial gcs were assembled from the mergers of many low - mass sub - clumps , as opposed to a single monolothic collapse .",
    "this is because the mass of the most massive cluster member correlates with the total cluster mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hence the massive stellar progenitors of the most massive bhs are unlikely to form in low - mass clusters .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the effects of accretion from the interstellar medium on the rate of two - body relaxation in a star cluster . to do this , we derived an accretion - modified relaxation time by adapting spitzer s two - component model to include the effects of accretion .",
    "we considered several different mass - dependencies and efficiency factors for the accretion rate , as well as different mass ratios for the two components of the model .",
    "we have shown that accretion acts to increase the rate of mass segregation .",
    "this is because the relaxation time is inversely proportional to the average mass , which increases due to accretion .",
    "there are two additional effects that accelerate the mass segregation process , assuming that the accretion rate increases with the accretor mass .",
    "first , accretion acts to increase the range of any initial mass spectrum , quickly driving the heaviest members to even higher masses .",
    "second , accretion acts to reduce the velocities of the accretors due to conservation of momentum , and it is the heaviest members that are affected the most . using our two - component model , these effects have been quantified as a function of the accretion rate , the total cluster mass , and the component masses .",
    "we have discussed our results in the context of the dynamical evolution of primordial globular clusters and their black hole sub - populations .",
    "we kindly thank an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions that improved our manuscript , as well as cole miller for useful discussions . as is supported by nserc .",
