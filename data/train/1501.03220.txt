    "more and more accurate and convincing astronomical observations @xcite indicate that dark energy dominates our current universe .",
    "although a host of observationally viable dark energy models have been proposed , the nature of dark energy is still undetermined .",
    "the einstein cosmological constant is in many respects the most economical solution to the problem of dark energy .",
    "but it is confronted with two fundamental problems : the fine tuning problem and the coincidence problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "so one turn to the study of other options for dark energy , for example , quintessence @xcite , quintom @xcite , k - essence @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , holographic dark energy @xcite and so on .",
    "one find that in many models of quintessence field , there exist the so - called tracker solutions . in these solutions",
    ", the quintessence field always has a energy density closely tracks ( but is smaller than ) that of the radiation until the matter - radiation equality . by this way",
    ", the coincidence problem is solved @xcite .",
    "phantom energy is introduced into the study of cosmic evolution by caldwell  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of phantom takes the form @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the phantom field and @xmath2 the phantom potential . by changing the sign of kinetic term in quintessence field _ by hand , _ this form of lagrangian could be obtained .",
    "one then find that the energy density of phantom actually increases with cosmic time .",
    "so the fate of the universe is a big rip .",
    "now we want to ask : can we unify quintessence and phantom in a natural way ?",
    "the answer is yes . we find that the quintessence and phantom can naturally emerge in the theory of split - complex scalar field , the split - quaternion scalar field and the split - octonion scalar field .",
    "this finding is motivated by the mathematic theory of split - complex numbers ( or hyperbolic numbers , also perplex numbers ) , the split - quaternion numbers ( or coquaternion numbers ) and the split - octonion numbers @xcite ( for references , see also the wikipedia ] ) .",
    "we note that our application of split - complex number is not just a mathematical tool but rather it has physical information too .",
    "actually , the theory of split - complex number has been applied in gravitational fields @xcite , quantum group @xcite , quantum mechanics @xcite , quintessence cosmology @xcite and so on .",
    "what is more , with the help of split - complex variables , a pseudo - complex field theory @xcite and a pseudo - complex general relativity @xcite are recently presented . for the split - complex scalar field ,",
    "if one require it obeys the symmetry of invariance under hyperbolic rotation , the split - complex field would restore to the hessence field @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the symmetry is allowed to be broken , the split - complex scalar field would turn out to be the quintom field @xcite .",
    "coleman found that for conventional complex field , there exists @xmath3 solutions @xcite due to the conserved charge .",
    "we find there is also conserved charge for split - complex field .",
    "so we expect @xmath3-like solutions exist which makes the split - complex field more physical .",
    "finally , we find the split - complex scalar field could be re - formulated as one specific model of the multi - filed theory which attracts a lot of effort in the study of inflationary universe @xcite in recent years . in all",
    ", the split scalar fields have rich physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : split ] , we define the notion of split - complex scalar field and show quintessence and phantom could emerge from this field . in section  [ sec : splitdy ] , we investigate the cosmic evolution of the split - complex field and show that the detail of dynamics is closely related to the initial conditions on the quintessence and phantom . in section  [ sec : qua ] , we investigate the cosmic evolution of the split - quaternion field . in section  [ sec : stable ] , the linear perturbations of these fields in the background of friedmann - robertson - walker universe are present .",

    "the quantity @xmath9 is similar to the imaginary unit @xmath10 except that @xcite @xmath11 choosing @xmath12 results in the conventional complex scalar field .",
    "it is this change of sign which distinguishes the split - complex scalar field from the ordinary complex one .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 here is not a real number but an independent quantity .",
    "namely , it is not equal to @xmath13 .",
    "just as for ordinary complex field , one can define the notion of a split - complex conjugate as follows @xmath14 then the modulus of a split - complex scalar field is given by the isotropic quadratic form @xmath15 this quadratic form is split into positive and negative parts , in contrast to the positive definite form of the ordinary complex scalar field .",
    "similar to the ordinary complex field which can be written in the form of euler s formula @xmath16 the split - complex field has the euler s formula as follows @xmath17 this can be derived from a power series expansion using the fact that @xmath18 has only even powers while that for @xmath19 has odd powers .",
    "it follows that @xmath20 .",
    "we shall consider the theory of a massive , split - complex , self - interacting scalar field with the lagrangian density as follows    @xmath21    with @xmath22 the mass of the scalar and @xmath23 a coupling constant . here",
    "the potential is the same as minimally coupled higgs potential which has been given experimental evidence .",
    "of course , one may consider other potentials , i.e , exponential potential , power - law potential and so on .",
    "however , if one demand the theory obeys the symmetry of hyperbolic rotation ( see subsection @xmath24 below ) , the potential should be constrained to be the function of @xmath25 , namely @xmath26 . on the other hand , if the symmetry is broken , the potential could be @xmath27 . in the next , we will see the former is exactly the hessence field @xcite and the latter the quintom field @xcite .",
