    "we report the results of the optical interferometry of the interacting system of galaxies ngc  7769 , 7770 , 7771 and 7771a and analyze their kinematics .",
    "a detailed description of the morphological features of the galaxies as well as photometry and color analysis of ngc  7769 are presented in the complete version of the study : @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the influence of interaction on the kinematics , dynamics and star formation in the system .",
    "known models of galaxy interactions are based mostly on statistical observational data .",
    "we try to illustrate how and to what extend these models can be applied to explain the features of the galaxies in this system .    in order to study the velocity fields of the galaxies ,",
    "the observations were carried out at the 2.6 m telescope of the byurakan astrophysical observatory ( bao , armenia ) on 8 november 1996 , with the byufosc ( byurakan faint object spectral camera ) in the interferometric mode , attached at the prime focus of the telescope .    based on the h@xmath0 velocity fields ( the right - hand panels of figure  [ vrot_velr ] ) , we calculated the rotation curves of the galaxies ( the left - hand panels of figure  [ vrot_velr ] ) by using data points within sectors along the maximal gradient direction , see isovelocity contours in the right - hand panels of figure  [ vrot_velr ] .",
    "maximal rotational velocity of ngc  7769 is observed at the radius of around 15  arcsec from the galaxy nucleus .",
    "the rotational velocities in figure  [ vrot_velr ] are in good agreement with the hi measurements ( @xmath1 ) in @xcite .",
    "our measurements of velocities , having a better spatial resolution compared with those of the previous studies ( @xcite ) , reveal weak perturbations of the rotation curve of ngc  7769 , which may be caused by interaction with ngc  7771 .",
    "the same can not be said about the velocity field of ngc  7771 .",
    "figure  [ vrot_velr ] shows that there are perturbations and large dispersion in radial velocities at the distances larger than about 10 - 15 arcsec from the nuclei .",
    "this distance is about half radius of the bar .",
    "evidently , this scatter of radial velocities can be explained by the fact that part of the arms are included in the sector used to calculate radial velocities ( sector angle is @xmath2 ) .",
    "however the asymmetric profile along the major axis suggests that northern and southern arms do not have the same radial velocity profiles .",
    "the asymmetric tidal forces of ngc  7769 and ngc  7770 affecting on ngc  7771 , seem to be a natural cause of that .    the rotation curve of ngc  7770 is significantly skewed .",
    "this is probably because of the strong harassing interaction with the more massive ngc  7771 , see @xcite .",
    "the rotation curve of ngc  7771a is typical for a late type sm galaxy .",

    "our better data support this conclusion .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the latest models of galaxy collisions ( ) showing that during direct collisions tidally induced spiral arms are much longer and brighter than those during retrograde collisions .",
    "we can conclude that galaxies ngc  7769 and ngc  7771 already have passed the first pericenter stage , however , probably the second encounter has not happened yet .",
    "the first pericenter distance should have been large enough ( around few sizes of the galaxies ) , so that large disturbances in rotation curves have not appeared yet .",
    "the quartet of galaxies ngc  7769 , 7770 , 7771 and 7771a is a system of interacting galaxies . here",
    ", we present a fabry - perot imaging study of the system in h@xmath0 line .",
    "we came to the following main conclusions :    * close interaction between the component galaxies of the system has produced morphological features that are characteristic of the interactions .",
    "we have detected features such as tidal arms , spiral arms induced by close interaction , bars and induced star formation . * from the results of our interferometric observations , we obtained the radial velocity profiles of galaxies .",
    "the rotation curve of ngc  7769 is weakly distorted .",
    "the rotation curve of ngc  7771 is strongly distorted by the tidal arms caused by direct flyby of ngc  7769 and flyby of a smaller neighbor ngc  7770 .",
    "the rotation curve of ngc  7770 is significantly skewed because of the interaction with much massive ngc  7771 . *",
    "the radial velocity profiles and morphological disturbances suggest that the ngc 7769 and ngc  7771 have passed the first pericenter stage , however , probably the second encounter has not happened yet .",
    "study of such systems with methods combining photometric and visual analysis is an effective way to clarify features of star formation in different stages of interaction .",
    "ongoing and future surveys using integral field spectroscopy will allow also to explore the spatial distribution of star formation in interacting systems .",
