    "we showed here , that this angle tends to be @xmath96 , that is , stripes align perpendicular to the interface .",
    "recent work on the swift - hohenberg equation @xcite shows that one expects a family of oblique stripes with @xmath808 to accompany a time - periodic solution forming vertical stripes , that is existence of solutions as depicted in figure [ figure_1-horizontal ] , top right . given the results in @xcite , one would therefore expect oblique stripes in cahn - hilliard as well .",

    "we did not perform a stability analysis of these patterns . in the allen - cahn case , stripes are unstable and any stability result would need to be understood in a pointwise sense .",
    "one could for instance focus on the absence of singularities of the green s function , that is , the absence of zeros of an analytic extension of the evans function , first . on the other hand , restricting to the reduced domains , with dirichlet boundary conditions at @xmath378 and @xmath809 , we would expect the solutions found here to be stable . in fact , interpreting our iteration schemes used in the proof as an implicit euler time stepping for the parabolic flow , we recognize that , at least in the truncated problems , stability is a prerequisite for showing existence using our methods . an interesting marginal case is the @xmath63 case , where a single interface is created . we suspect that this solution @xmath374 is stable also as a solution in @xmath375 , although decay would be slow as the relaxation of an infinitely bent interface happens on a diffusive time scale .",
    "as pointed out before , our analysis should apply to a large class of odd nonlinearities . dropping this symmetry ,",

    "one can readily suspect that for non - balanced nonlinearities , @xmath810 , where @xmath811 are the two stable equilibria , interfaces created at the trigger would move , but establishing existence and selection laws for the angle , for single interfaces or periodic interface arrangements behind the trigger , appears to be challenging .",
