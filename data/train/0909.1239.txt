    "super@xmath0 is a next generation asymmetric @xmath1 flavor factory with very high peak luminosity ( @xmath5 ) proposed to be built in the rome area .",
    "the main purpose of the experiment is to search for evidence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and investigate its nature .",
    "the search for new physics ( np ) is the main goal of elementary particle physics in the next decade .",
    "the search is encouraged by the expectation that the np mass scale be around 1 tev , thus directly accessible to the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern . in this context , it is important to clarify the role of a super@xmath0 factory by considering two scenarios depending on whether or not evidence of np will be found at the lhc .",
    "if direct evidence of np is found at the lhc , super@xmath0 will help determining the flavor structure of np by constraining its couplings , mixing angles and masses through the measurement of rare decays whose amplitudes are mediated by loops in the sm , or through the observation of lepton flavor violating processes .",
    "the flavor physics observables measured at a super flavor factory provide a set of independent constraints complementary to those measured at high @xmath6 processes . to reconstruct the np lagrangian",
    "both contributions are required .",
    "if instead the lhc does not discover np particles , super@xmath0 will allow to explore mass scales up to 10 tev or beyond ( depending on the models ) and could provide the first evidence of np .",
    "one may ask how the super@xmath0 program compares with the flavor physics potential of lhcb .",
    "the outcome of the comparison is that even in this case the complementarity is large .",
    "for example , rare decay modes with one or more neutrinos in the final state such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , inclusive analyses of processes such as @xmath9 and @xmath10 or measurements of the ckm matrix elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 are unique to super@xmath0 , where the environment of the @xmath1 collider is clean and relatively simple compared to the events at the hadronic machine  @xcite . some examples will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : physics_case ] . on the other hand ,",
    "lhcb has access to measurements that are not possible at super@xmath0 , such as the time - dependent study of the oscillations of @xmath13 mesons .",
    "it is important to stress that super@xmath0 will also provide huge samples of charm hadron and @xmath14 lepton pairs ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 per year , respectively , at the nominal luminosity ) , enabling powerful studies of np effects in the up - type quark and lepton sectors with unprecedented precision .",
    "moreover , the machine is being designed to run in a wide range of center - of - mass ( cm ) energies , down to the @xmath14 threshold and up to the @xmath17 mass , thus enriching further the physics program .    to reach the goals of super@xmath0 in terms of sensitivity ,",
    "a data sample of about two orders of magnitude larger than the ones accumulated by the current @xmath0-factories babar ( 0.53ab@xmath4 ) and belle ( 0.95ab@xmath4 ) is needed .",
    "a collider baseline luminosity of @xmath2  @xmath3s@xmath4 would allow to collect 15ab@xmath4 per year ( 1 yr=@xmath18s ) corresponding to a data sample of more than 80 billion @xmath19 pairs in five years of running at the @xmath20 cm energy .",
    "in this section a short selection of measurements that are part of the super@xmath0 physics program are briefly discussed . the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for an extensive discussion of the physics reach of the experiment .",
    "one of the strengths of the physics program of super@xmath0 is the large number of decays where the sm uncertainty is small and that can display a measurable deviation from the sm in one or more np scenarios .",
    "a large fraction of these golden channels are rare @xmath0 decays where np particles enter the leading loops .",
    "a selection of golden modes in different np scenarios is reported in table  [ tab : golden_modes ] .",
    "the list of observables in the table is not complete , as well as the number of np scenarios considered .    .",
    "[ tab : golden_modes ] golden modes in different new physics scenarios .",
    "an `` x '' indicates the golden channel of a given scenario .",
    "an `` o '' marks modes which are not the `` golden '' one of a given scenario but can still display a measurable deviation from the standard model .",
    "the label @xmath21 denotes golden modes which require the high - precision determination of the ckm parameters achievable at super@xmath0 .",
    "table from  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : tau ]      super@xmath0 can operate as a charm factory at the cm energy of both the @xmath20 and the @xmath22 , where the quantum correlations in the coherent production of @xmath23 can be exploited  @xcite .",
    "the charm production cross section at the @xmath20 cm energy is comparable to the @xmath24 cross section , @xmath25  nb . at production threshold",
    "the luminosity is smaller by a factor of ten with respect to the baseline value , but it is partially compensated by a cross section about three times larger .",
    "the recent observation of the @xmath26 mixing opens a unique window to the search of @xmath27 violation in the charm sector , whose observation would provide a strong hint of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the program also includes the search of @xmath27 violation in time - independent measurements and the study of rare and forbidden charm decays , as well as precise measurements of ckm matrix parameters  @xcite .",
    "to reach the required luminosity of @xmath2  @xmath3s@xmath4 super@xmath0 exploits a new collision scheme which is based on a small collision area , very small @xmath28 at the interaction point , large piwinsky angle and the crab waist scheme  @xcite .",
    "this novel approach has several advantages , most notably the fact that the very large improvement in luminosity is achieved with beam currents and wall plug power similar to those of the current @xmath0-factories , and with limited background rates . in the current layout",
    "the accelerator consists of 4  gev/7  gev positron / electron beams , corresponding to a cm boost @xmath29 in the lab frame ( half the value in babar ) .",
    "the super@xmath0 detector concept is based on the babar design  @xcite with some modifications required to deal with the reduced boost and higher event rates .",
    "a number of components of the slac @xmath0-factory can be reused , resulting in a significant reduction of costs .",
    "this includes parts of the pep - ii accelerator complex , the super - conducting solenoid , the csi(tl ) crystals of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) and the quartz bars of the cherenkov particle identification system ( dirc ) .    in the remainder of this section a short description of the detector under development",
    "is provided , focussing on a few aspects where super@xmath0 differs from babar .",
    "the tracking system is composed of a silicon vertex detector ( svt ) surrounded by the drift chamber ( dch ) . to maintain sufficient @xmath30 resolution for time - dependent @xmath27 violation measurements with the reduced super@xmath0 boost ,",
    "the vertex resolution is improved by reducing the radius of the innermost layer of svt ( layer-0 ) down to about 1.5  cm , which is the lower limit allowed by the background rates according to preliminary simulation studies .",
    "two main options are being considered for the layer-0 , cmos monolithic active pixels thin sensors  @xcite or hybrid pixels detectors  @xcite , while the outer silicon layers are made of microstrips silicon sensors . the starting point for the dch layout",
    "is the babar drift chamber , though the design optimization process may eventually end up in a quite different device .",
    "anticipated improvements include a lighter , carbon - fiber , mechanical structure and faster readout electronics .",
    "the hadron particle identification system is placed just outside the dch and will make use of the radiator quartz bars of the babar dirc , with the old pmts replaced by fast pixelated pmts and the imaging region reduced in size to control the background rates .",
    "the emc can reuse the barrel portion of the babar emc , made of 5760 csi(tl ) crystals .",
    "this fact is very important because the barrel emc is the most expensive element of the detector .",
    "in contrast , the csi(tl ) crystals of the forward endcap will be replaced with l(y)so crystals , which are suitable for their excellent radiation hardness , fast decay time , small molire radius and relatively high light yield .",
    "the outermost detector system is the instrumented flux return for the detection of muons and neutral hadrons .",
    "the resistive plate chambers and limited streamer tubes used in babar will be replaced by extruded scintillator bars  la minos  @xcite and the amount and distribution of the absorber ( iron or brass ) will be optimized .",
    "two additional systems are being considered to possibly improve the performance of the detector : a forward particle identification device placed between the dch and the forward endcap emc , and a backward emc calorimeter .",
    "two candidates for the pid system are currently being compared , an aerogel radiator rich and a time - of - flight system using a sheet of fused silica radiator  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the backward emc would be to reject background events by detecting extra energy in that region , and therefore the energy resolution is not a critical parameter .",
    "a relatively simple device made of lead plates and scintillating strips may be adequate .",
    "a technical design report ( tdr ) of the project is in preparation and is expected to be completed within two years .",
    "super@xmath0 is a next generation asymmetric energy @xmath1 flavor factory operating mainly at the @xmath20 cm energy but with the possibility to run in a wide range of energies , from the @xmath31 threshold up to the @xmath17 .",
    "the main goal of the experiment is to search for evidence of physics beyond the standard model in the decays of heavy quarks and leptons , and to constrain its parameters . super@xmath0 and the lhc are largely complementary in their effort to observe np effects . in five years at the baseline luminosity of @xmath2  @xmath3s@xmath4 super@xmath0 can collect 75ab@xmath4 , which correspond to about @xmath32 @xmath24 pairs , @xmath33 @xmath14 lepton pairs and @xmath34 @xmath35 pairs .",
    "this dataset allows to explore and test the flavor sector of the standard model with unprecedented precision .",
    "the project has entered the tdr phase which is expected to last two years .",
    "the author would like to thank the conference organizers and the super@xmath0 community for the opportunity to give this talk .",
