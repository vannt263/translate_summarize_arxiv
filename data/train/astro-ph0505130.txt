    "the modern theory of galaxy formation rests on the concept of gas cooling in dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "however , simple models of single phase cooling predict a mass function of galaxies significantly higher than observed .",
    "figure [ fig : mf ] , taken from @xcite , shows the cumulative mass function of galaxies in an hydrodynamical simulation compared to the observations of @xcite .",
    "the number density of galaxies at a fixed mass is too high at all masses , but becomes increasingly discrepant at high and low masses .",
    "thus the mass of cooled gas must be significantly reduced from the simple single phase cooling implemented in the hydrodynamical simulation , especially in high and low mass halos .     for a hydrodynamical simulation and , for comparison ,",

    "( 2003 ) ) .",
    "the y - axis is in comoving units with @xmath0 .",
    "the simulation produces far too many low and high mass galaxies , but galaxies around the bend in the schechter function are only a factor of 2 - 3 too massive . the bottom panel shows the factor by which the simulated galaxies masses should be divided in order to agree with the observations . for the galaxy masses of @xmath1 , the correction is roughly a factor of 2.75 as shown by the dotted line and does not depend strongly on galaxy mass . ]",
    "one solution to the problem for high mass halos is to consider multi - phase cooling .",
    "a cooling astrophysical plasma is thermally unstable and will naturally fragment and form a two - phase medium @xcite .",
    "this means that a significant fraction of the halo gas can remain in a hot low - density galactic corona , while the remaining gas cools into warm clouds and settles into a galactic disk only after loosing kinetic energy from collisions or ram pressure ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( maller & bullock 2004 ) ) .",
    "the result of such a model is to significantly reduce cooling in massive dark matter halos , bringing the high mass end of the galaxy mass function into agreement with observations ( see figure [ fig : mp ] ) .",
    "specifically , for a galaxy in a milky way size halo if we take the warm clouds to have a mass of @xmath2 then the mass of the galaxy s disk is half of what it would be in single - phase cooling and in good agreement with estimates of the milky way s mass . for",
    "the gas that does not end up in the disk , two thirds is in a hot galactic corona while one third is in the form of warm clouds .    besides the agreement with the high mass end of the observed stellar mass function we would like to see observational evidence for the multi - phase nature of halo gas .",
    "@xcite argue that the population of high velocity clouds seen in hi around the milky way represent this fragmented cloud population , the neutral component of mostly ionized @xmath3 clouds . for other galaxies ,",
    "quasar absorption systems are the best way to verify this picture .",
    "also , while we know that the cooling is thermally unstable , we do not know what the resulting distribution of warm cloud masses should be and how it might depend on halo mass and redshift . thus studying these clouds in differing environments",
    "is crucial to understanding the effect of multi - phase cooling on galaxy formation .",
    "it has long been assumed that quasar absorption systems can be identified with the gaseous content of galaxy halos @xcite .",
    "in fact the very multi - phase model discussed here has been proposed as the source of lyman limit and metal - line systems by @xcite . in the next section",
    "i describe the gaseous content of a galaxy s halo and how observations of absorption systems may help us constrain their properties .",
    ". only clouds that fall to the center of each halo are assumed to contribute to the central galaxy .",
    "no merging has been accounted for in this estimate .",
    "merging will tend to populate the massive tail of the galaxy mass function , likely bringing it even more closely in line with what is observed . ]",
    "figure [ fig : gh ] shows a sketch of possible components of the gaseous content of a galaxy s halo . while we know a neutral gas disk is present in all spiral galaxies locally , the hot gas disk is only detected in the milky way ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( wang et al . 2005 ) ) .",
    "the existence of a galactic corona was postulated for the milky way long ago @xcite ; however , it remains difficult to detect directly .",
    "this same component is clearly seen in clusters and groups where the higher temperature makes it visible in x - rays .",
    "recently , there has been indirect evidence for the existence of a galactic corona around the milky way from its interaction with high velocity clouds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( e.g. tripp et  al . 2003 ) ) ,    as described below , the contributions of gas stripped from satellite galaxies , cooled from the galactic corona or ejected by energetic feedback to the gaseous halo is still unclear . while all these processes happen at some level , their relative importance is model dependant and probably a function of halo mass and redshift .",
    "further observations and more detailed modeling are needed to build a more complete picture .",
    "below i give a brief description of each component and what absorption systems they maybe associated with .    * _ the neutral gas disk .",
    "_ neutral gas in a galaxy s disk is the fuel for star formation and is observed in hi and as damped lyman alpha and lyman limit systems .",
    "however , based on the kinematics of damped lyman alpha systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( prochaska & wolfe 1997 ; 1998 ) ) it is not clear that at high redshift neutral gas is primarily associated with gas disks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( haehnelt et  al . 1998 ; maller et  al . 2001 ) ) .",
    "it is also unclear where the transition from predominantly neutral to predominantly ionized gas occurs , except that it is below the defining column density of damped lyman alpha systems . * _ the hot gas disk . _",
    "the milky way s disk is enveloped in a second hot ( @xmath4 ) disk with a scale length @xmath5 kpc .",
    "the cooling times for this component are short , so it must be constantly refueled ( or re - energized ) most likely from supernova explosions .",
    "this component is the dominant source of x - ray absorption around the milky way making direct detection of the galactic corona and the local warm hot intergalactic medium extremely difficult @xcite .",
    "* _ the galactic corona .",
    "_ this is the relic gas from the formation of a galaxy s dark matter halo . in clusters and massive groups",
    "it is observed in x - ray emission . in smaller mass halos cooling times",
    "are shorter and the galactic corona must have a lower density ( in the milky way of order @xmath6 ) .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to detect in x - rays , which is further complicated by the existence of the hot gas disk . in dwarf galaxies the cooling times are so short that there is effectively no hot gas corona . *",
    "_ gas stripped from satellite galaxies .",
    "_ gas stripped from satellite galaxies and during merges will also inhabit a galaxy s halo @xcite .",
    "the most impressive example of this locally is the magelenic stream .",
    "this gas can be thought of as a subset of the warm clouds infalling into the galaxy in multi - phase cooling and can be a source of lyman limit and metal - line systems . * _ gas clouds from multi - phase cooling . _ in multi - phase cooling we expect warm clouds to condense out of the cooling galactic corona ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( maller & bullock 2004 ; mo & miralda - escude 1996 ) ) . these clouds ( seen perhaps as high velocity clouds in the milky way )",
    "may give rise to lyman limit and metal - line systems .",
    "this gas can help explain the kinematics of high - ionization - state gas in damped lyman alpha systems @xcite .",
    "* _ gas ejected by supernova or other feedback . _",
    "supernova and other energetic sources ( e.g. agn ) can eject gas from the galaxies disk into the halo and possibly entirely out of the halo .",
    "this is directly detected around star - bursting galaxies .",
    "this gas can give rise to metal - line and lyman limit systems and even possibly damped lyman alpha systems at high redshift .",
    "it is important to note that low mass dark matter halos are expected to have a negligible mass in the galactic corona .",
    "therefore , there is little mass in warm clouds in these halos , _ and _ it is easier to eject gas by supernova driven winds .",
    "thus , it is likely that the content of a galaxy s halo may be a strong function of the galaxy s halo mass .",
    "most absorption systems could be the result of more than one component , complicating the interpretation of observations .",
    "therefore , it is important to look for ways to distinguish which component of the gaseous halo is the source of an absorption system .",
    "metallicities , ionization states and kinematics can all be useful diagnostics in this endeavor",
    ". constraints on the properties of each component can be used to distinguish between models of gas cooling in galaxies and thus are central to understanding galaxy formation .    .",
    "the galaxy s halo may also contain gas stripped from infalling satellites , gas clouds that have cooled out of the galactic corona ( multi - phase cooling ) , and gas that has been ejected from the disk because of energetic feedback .",
    "all of these sources of gas may give rise to absorption systems in quasar spectra . ]",
    "i have shown how multi - phase cooling can match the high mass end of the galaxy mass function above and that observations of absorption systems are an important probe of this model . only from absorption systems",
    "can we probe how the warm cloud masses vary with halo mass and redshift .",
    "furthermore , i have outlined the gaseous content of a galaxy s halo and how absorption systems probe various components of it . because different components can give rise to the same type of absorption system it is necessary to use other diagnostics to determine what component the absorption system is probing . in summary ,",
    "the study of absorption systems is crucial to understanding how gas cools in dark matter halos and therefore how galaxies form .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the conference for the exceptional meeting and the chance to visit shanghai , china .",
    "also , i d like to thank james bullock for his comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript and the hospitality of the center for cosmology at the university of california , irvine ."
