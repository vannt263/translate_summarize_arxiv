    "the thermodynamics of asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes , which produces an aggregate of ideas from thermodynamics , quantum field theory and classical gravity , continues to attract a great deal of attention .",
    "one reason for this is the role of ads / cft duality @xcite , and in particular , witten interpretation of the hawking - page phase transition between thermal ads and asymptotically ads black hole as the confinement - deconfinment phases of the yang - mills theory defined on the asymptotic boundaries of the ads geometry @xcite .",
    "the fact that thermodynamics of black holes may be modified by using other theories of gravity with higher derivative ( hd ) curvature terms provides a strong motivation for considering thermodynamics of black holes in hd gravity @xcite .",
    "the appearance of hd gravitational terms can be seen , for example , in the renormalization of quantum field theory in curved spacetime @xcite , or in the construction of low - energy effective action of string theory @xcite . among the theories of gravity with higher derivative curvature terms",
    ", the gauss - bonnet gravity has some special features in some sense .",
    "indeed , in order to have a ghost - free action , the quadratic curvature corrections to the einstein - hilbert action should be proportional to the gauss - bonnet term @xcite .",
    "this combination also appear naturally in the next - to - leading order term of the heterotic string effective action , and plays a fundamental role in chern - simons gravitational theories @xcite . from a geometric point of view",
    ", the combination of the einstein - gauss - bonnet terms constitutes , for five dimensional spacetimes , the most general lagrangian producing second order field equations , as in the four - dimensional gravity which the einstein - hilbert action is the most general lagrangian producing second order field equations @xcite .    to investigate the thermodynamics of black holes",
    ", one should compute the finite conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the system .",
    "in general the gravitational action is divergent when evaluated on solutions , as is the hamiltonian and other associated conserved quantities .",
    "a common approach to evaluating thermodynamic quantities has been to carry out all computations relative to some other spacetime that is regarded as the ground state for the class of spacetimes of interest .",
    "this could be done by taking the original action for gravity coupled to matter fields and subtracting from it a reference action , which is a functional of the induced metric @xmath1 on the boundary @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "conserved and/or thermodynamic quantities are then computed relative to this boundary , which can then be taken to infinity if desired .",
    "unfortunately , it suffers from several drawbacks .",
    "the choice of reference spacetime is not always unique @xcite , nor is it always possible to embed a boundary with a given induced metric into the reference background .",
    "an extension of this approach which addresses these difficulties was developed based on the conjectured ads / cft correspondence for asymptotic ads spacetimes @xcite .",
    "applications of ads / cft correspondence also include computations of conserved quantities for black holes with rotation , nut charge , various topologies , rotating black strings with zero curvature horizons and rotating higher genus black branes @xcite .",
    "although the counterterm method applies for the case of a specially infinite boundary , it was also employed for the computation of the conserved and thermodynamic quantities in the case of a finite boundary @xcite .",
    "it is believed that appending a counterterm , @xmath3 , to the action which depends only on the intrinsic geometry of the boundary(ies ) can remove the divergences .",
    "this requirement , along with general covariance , implies that these terms are functionals of curvature invariants of the induced metric and have no dependence on the extrinsic curvature of the boundary(ies)@xcite .",
    "an algorithmic procedure exists for constructing @xmath4 for asymptotic ads in einstein gravity and so its determination in this theory is unique @xcite . but in hd gravity these conterterms have been not introduced till now . since these counterterms should be functions of intrinsic curvature of boundary , the construction of these terms for spacetimes with flat boundaries is straightforward @xcite .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    "we give a brief review of the field equations of gauss - bonnet gravity and the counterterm method for calculating conserved quantities in sec .",
    "[ conserved ] . in sec .",
    "[ therm ] we obtain mass , angular momentum , entropy , temperature , charge , and electric potential of the @xmath0-dimensional black hole solutions with a complete set of rotational parameters and show that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "we also perform a local stability analysis of the black holes in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles .",
    "we finish our paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the gravitational action of an @xmath0-dimensional asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes @xmath5 with the gauss - bonnet term in the present of an electromagnetic field is : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is electromagnetic tensor field , @xmath8 is the vector potential , @xmath9 is the cosmological constant , @xmath10 is gauss - bonnet coefficient with dimensions @xmath11 which we assume to be positive as in heterotic string theory , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are riemann tensor , ricci tensor and ricci scalar of the manifold @xmath5 respectively , @xmath15 is induced metric on the boundary @xmath16 , @xmath17 is trace of extrinsic curvature of the boundary , @xmath18 is einstein tensor calculated on the boundary , and @xmath19 is trace of : @xmath20 the second integral is a surface term which is chosen such that the variational principle is well - defined @xcite . in order to obtain the field equations by the variation of the volume integral with respect to the fields , one should impose the boundary condition @xmath21 on @xmath16 .",
    "thus the action ( [ act1 ] ) is appropriate to study the grand - canonical ensemble with fixed electric potential @xcite . to study the canonical ensemble with fixed electric charge",
    "one should impose the boundary condition @xmath22 , and therefore the gravitational action is @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24  is the normal to the boundary @xmath16 .",
    "varying the action ( [ act1 ] ) or ( [ act2 ] ) with respect to the metric tensor @xmath25 and electromagnetic tensor field @xmath26 , with appropriate boundary condition , the equations of gravitation and electromagnetic fields are obtained as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the einstein tensor , @xmath29 is the energy - momentum tensor of electromagnetic field and @xmath30 is second order lovelock tensor : @xmath31 in general the action @xmath32 , is divergent when evaluated on the solutions , as is the hamiltonian and other associated conserved quantities . rather than eliminating these divergences by incorporating reference term",
    ", a counterterm @xmath4 is added to the action which is functional only of the boundary curvature invariants . for asymptotically ads",
    "spacetimes with flat boundary , all the counterterm containing the curvature invariants of the boundary are zero and therefore the counterterm reduces to a volume term as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a length factor that depends on the fundamental constants @xmath35 and @xmath10 , that must reduce to @xmath35 as @xmath10 goes to zero .",
    "thus , the total action , @xmath36 , can be written as @xmath37 having the total finite action , one can use brown and york definition @xcite to construct a divergence free stress - energy tensor as    @xmath38    to compute the conserved charges of the spacetime , one should choose a spacelike hypersurface @xmath39 in @xmath16 with metric @xmath40 , and write the boundary metric in adm form :    @xmath41    where the coordinates @xmath42 are the angular variables parameterizing the hypersurface of constant @xmath43 around the origin .",

    "we obtain @xmath51 provided the surface @xmath39 contains the orbits of @xmath52 .",
    "these quantities are , respectively , the conserved mass and angular momentum of the system enclosed by the boundary . note that they will both be dependent on the location of the boundary @xmath39 in the spacetime , although each is independent of the particular choice of foliation @xmath39 within the boundary @xmath16 . in the context of the ( a)ds / cft correspondence , the limit in which the boundary @xmath39 becomes infinite ( @xmath53 ) is taken , and the counterterm prescription ensures that the action and conserved charges are finite .",
    "no embedding of the surface @xmath39 into a reference spacetime is required and the quantities which are computed are intrinsic to the spacetimes .",
