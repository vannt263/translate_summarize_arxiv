    "a fano manifold is a smooth complex projective variety @xmath0 with ample anticanonical class .",
    "these varieties have a rich structure , and play an important role in higher dimensional geometry under the viewpoint of mori theory , because they appear as fibers of mori contractions of fiber type of smooth projective varieties .",
    "after @xcite we know that @xmath0 is rationally connected and simply connected . moreover",
    "smooth fano varieties of dimension @xmath11 form a limited family , so they have only a finite number of possible topological types . however in general very little is known about their topological invariants .    in particular we consider here the second betti number @xmath12 of @xmath0 , which coincides with the picard number @xmath9 .",
    "recall that a del pezzo surface @xmath13 has @xmath14 .",
    "fano @xmath15-folds have been classified by iskovskikh , mori , and mukai , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "thus we know that a fano @xmath15-fold @xmath0 has @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , more is true : as soon as @xmath17 , @xmath0 is a product of a del pezzo surface with @xmath18 ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2 ) .",
    "starting from dimension @xmath19 , we do not have a bound on @xmath9 .",
    "the known examples with largest picard number are just products of del pezzo surfaces with picard number @xmath20 , which gives @xmath21 .",
    "optimistically one could think that fano varieties with large picard number are simpler , maybe a product of lower dimensional varieties .",
    "this would yield a linear bound ( in the dimension @xmath11 ) for @xmath9 , in fact one could expect precisely @xmath22 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is actually what happens in the toric case : if @xmath0 is a smooth toric fano variety of dimension  @xmath11 , then @xmath23 , and equality holds if and only if @xmath11 is even and @xmath0 is @xmath24 , @xmath13 the blow - up of @xmath25 in three non collinear points ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us also recall that there is a class of fano varieties for which a stronger linear bound on @xmath9 is expected .",
    "these are fano varieties which do not contain curves of anticanonical degree @xmath26 , e.g.  fano varieties of index @xmath27 . in this case",
    "it is expected that @xmath28 , with equality only for @xmath29 .",
    "this is a generalization of a conjecture by mukai , and has been proved in dimension @xmath30 and in the toric case , see @xcite .",
    "a strategy in this direction is to look for a contraction @xmath31 of fiber type on @xmath0 , and try to bound @xmath9 in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath3 is a general fiber .",
    "there are ( at least ) two difficulties in this approach .",
    "first , @xmath7 may not be fano , so that we do not know how to bound @xmath32 .",
    "second , surely @xmath3 is fano , but in general @xmath33 is much smaller than @xmath34 ( for instance any del pezzo surface @xmath13 admits a contraction @xmath35 with general fiber @xmath18 ) .",
    "this problem could be avoided by considering only elementary contractions of fiber type , for which @xmath36 .",
    "however this is not very satisfactory , because we do not necessarily expect a fano variety with large picard number to have an elementary contraction of fiber type ( think of a product of del pezzo surfaces ) .",
    "this was our motivation to introduce the notion of `` quasi elementary '' contraction of fiber type .",
    "this is a contraction of fiber type as above , such that if @xmath37 is a general fiber , then the image of @xmath38 contains all numerical classes of curves contracted by @xmath4 ( see definition [ quasiel ] ) .",
