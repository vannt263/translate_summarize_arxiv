    "the minority game ( mg ) models was introduced by _ challet _ and _ zhang _ in 1997 as a model for the competition for limited resources@xcite , which have attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "the basic scenario is easy to explain : there is a population of @xmath1 players who , at each time step , have to choose either 0 or 1 .",
    "those who are in the minority win , the other lose ( to avoid ambiguities , @xmath1 is chosen to be odd ) .",
    "the agents make their decisions based on the most recent @xmath2 outcomes , thus there are @xmath3 different histories .",
    "a strategy is defined as a table of @xmath3 choices ( either 0 or 1 ) for the @xmath3 corresponding histories , so that there are @xmath4 different strategies in the strategy - space .",
    "each agent randomly picks @xmath5 strategies from the strategy - space in the beginning of the mg . to each strategy",
    "is associated a integral point , which initially takes the value 0 and will increase by 1 at each time step if it predicts the result correctly .",
    "each agent uses the one with the highest point among his @xmath6 strategies , if there are several strategies with the same highest point , one of those will be chosen randomly .",
    "a very important quantity in this model is the overall loss defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the number of losers and the winners at time @xmath10 .",
    "apparently , the smaller @xmath11 is , the better the system performs .",
    "another related quantity is called the standard deviation and defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of agents who choose 0 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath15 and theoretically , the minimum value of @xmath16 is 0.25 .",
    "one of the focuses of scientists attention is the problem how to improve the performance of system , i.e. to reduce @xmath0 .",
    "recently , some new kinds of agent are introduced@xcite , by whom the overall performance of system is improved .",
    "a farther question is whether it is possible to achieve the global optimization in the framework of the mg model assuming that agents try to outsmart each other for their selfish gain and act based on inductive thinking@xcite .",
    "recently , a significant work is achieved by _ reents _ , et al , who propose a stochastic minority game model in which @xmath0 is minimized@xcite . in their model ,",
    "an agent will not change his choice in the next time step if he wins in the present turn , by contraries , he will change his choice at probability @xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is the same for all the agents .",
    "when @xmath18 , _ reents _ et al , found that @xmath19 .",
    "however , the agents in real - life systems are not as clever as _ reents _ , they do not know how to select a value of @xmath17 , and even do not know the total number of agents @xmath1 .",
    "thus _ reents _ s model may be not proper for the systems consisting of agent with inductive thinking .",
    "_ metzler _ and _ horn _ have introduced the evolution into the stochastic minority game model@xcite . similarly to the evolutionary minority game model@xcite , for an arbitrary agent * i *",
    ", a probability @xmath20 and a score @xmath21 is equipped@xcite .",
    "the score @xmath21 increases by 1 if the agent wins and decreases by 1 if the agent loses . when @xmath22 , the agent is deceased and replaced by a new agent with a reset score @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath20 of the new agent is randomly distributed in @xmath24 , the average value of @xmath20 in the final stationary state is found to be at the order of 1 and thus @xmath25 they also discussed the situation in which the new agent chooses @xmath20 by copying the value of @xmath26 of another agent who is randomly selected . within this scheme ,",
    "it is possible to see that @xmath27 and @xmath28 in sufficiently long time .",
    "however , it is still unreasonable to assume that an agent knows the information of all other agents .",
    "furthermore , @xmath17 is at the order of @xmath29 and thus @xmath0 is greater than 0.25 in the final state .",
    "the best solution is still not achieved in their model .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose a new model of minority game with so - called smart agents such that the standard deviation @xmath0 and the total loss in this model reach the theoretical minimum values in the limit of long time .",
    "the smart agents act based on inductive thinking but bring global optimization to the system . experimental results and analyses",
    "show that when other kinds of agents are also present , the smart agent can gain profits from producers and are much more competent than the noise traders and conventional agents in original minority game .",
    "our model consists of @xmath1 agents with @xmath1 an odd integer .",
    "each agent has only one strategy which evolves with the following rule : suppose at a given time step @xmath10 , the memory ( history ) is @xmath30 and the strategy of the @xmath31-th agent is @xmath32 for @xmath33 . also , each agent has a probability function @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath33 .",
    "if the @xmath31-th agent wins at @xmath10 , the strategy will not be changed ; contrarily , with probability @xmath36 , @xmath32 is not changed , with probability @xmath37 , @xmath38 , but @xmath39 for all other @xmath40 .",
    "the initial value of @xmath34 is randomly selected in @xmath24 and evolves by self - teaching mechanism , which is the simplest trail and error method . for a given time step @xmath10 with history @xmath30 ,",
    "consider the last time step @xmath41 when the memory is also @xmath30 .",
    "if the agent * i * won at @xmath41 or he loses but does not change @xmath42 , then no changes will occur . otherwise , @xmath37 will change according to the following rule@xcite : @xmath43 no changes will occur for all @xmath34 with @xmath44 .",
    "note that the evolution of @xmath37 for different memories is essentially decoupled in our model .",
    "therefore , mathematically speaking , the @xmath45 case is a trivial generalization of the @xmath46 case .",
    "the reason why we introduce different memories here is to mimic the behavior of the agents in real - life markets that the agents study the selection rules for different memories in order to find some regularities .",
    "[ 0.4 ] time evolution of @xmath47 for @xmath48 smart agents with @xmath490 ( a ) , 1 ( b ) , and 2 ( c ) .",
    "the value of @xmath47 shown in this figure is the average of 10 independent experiments and the horizontal line represents @xmath50.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure 1 shows the simulation results , which indicate that the system will reach global optimization in sufficiently long time .",
    "we have checked that the property of time evolution of @xmath16 for the cases with more agents and larger memory is the same as that of @xmath48 and @xmath51 .",
    "fig.2 presents the log - log plot for the time dependence of @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath48 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the results show that @xmath54 has a power law dependence of time with the exponent @xmath55 when @xmath10 is large , which suggests that @xmath56 , thus it is reasonable to suppose @xmath57 when @xmath10 is sufficiently large . in this case , at most one agent may change the strategy at each time step ( the probability for two or more agents changing their strategies at the same time is negligibly small ) thus the number of agents on the majority side is always @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the agent who changes the strategy is from the losing side to the losing side and @xmath20 is reduced by a factor of 2 . since @xmath57 , the probability that one agent will change his strategy is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the set of losers at time @xmath10 .",
    "then we have the iterative equations for @xmath54 and @xmath61 : @xmath62 @xmath63 according to * eq.*(4)&(5 ) , one can find that @xmath64 and @xmath65@xcite , which is consentaneous with the simulation results shown in figure 2 .

    "_ challet _ et al classified the agents into three different types@xcite : producers who have only one strategy , speculators ( conventional agents in original minority game ) who have two or more strategies , and the noise traders who make their choices by random tosses . in this section",
    ", we will investigate how smart agents perform in mixed market@xcite .",
    "firstly , let us look into how the smart agents compete with the producers .",
    "assume that there are @xmath68 producers and @xmath69 @xmath70 agents with @xmath71 an odd integer , each producer has only one fixed strategy .",
    "for simplicity , we shall first discuss the case of @xmath46 .",
    "suppose @xmath72 producers always choose 0 , and @xmath73 producers always choose 1 .",
    "if @xmath74 , then @xmath69 smart agents must choose 1(0 ) in the equilibrium state and win at each time step .",
    "when @xmath75 ( the case @xmath76 is analogic ) , the situation is slightly complicated . from the discussion in section 2 , it is not difficult to see that the overall loss of @xmath71 agents is minimized in the equilibrium state .",
    "namely , there will be either @xmath77 smart agents choosing 0 and @xmath78 smart agents choosing 1 or @xmath79 smart agents choosing 0 and @xmath80 smart agents choosing 1 . in the former case ,",
    "the agents choosing 0 are losers , whiles in the latter case , the agents choosing 0 are winners .",
    "the equilibrium state is described by the transition between two cases . before it switches to another case",
    ", the equilibrium state stays in one case for a period of time , called the life time .",
    "the life times of two cases are different .",
    "assume that the probability @xmath81 of agent * i * is independent of * i * , then the life time of the former case is @xmath82 and the latter case is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes the average value of @xmath81 .",
    "the overall gain of the smart agents at each time step is equal to @xmath85 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & { 1\\over n_s+1}[\\delta^2 - 1-n_s]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath86 when @xmath87 .",
    "the average profit gained by each smart agent at each time step is @xmath88\\ ] ]    according to * eq.*(7 ) , when @xmath89 , each smart agent can gain profits from producers .",
    "suppose the number of smart agent @xmath69 is not fixed , if @xmath89 , some new smart agents , if available , will join the game since they can gain profits from producers .",
    "thus there will be eventually @xmath90 smart agents in the market , whose profits are approximatively equal to 0 with slight fluctuation .",
    "this process can be considered as an example for the efficient market hypothesis ( emh ) , which is hotly controversial in the recent years@xcite .",
    "but in real - life financial market , the number of producers is alterable , thus the equilibrium state can rarely be reached .    when @xmath91 , the number of possible histories is @xmath92 . for a given history @xmath30 , suppose @xmath93 producers always choose 0 and @xmath94 producers always choose 1 .",
    "then @xmath95 is a function of @xmath30 . since different history @xmath30",
    "is essentially decoupled in our model and the number of smart agents @xmath69 is fixed , there may be three cases under history @xmath30 : ( i ) @xmath96 , each smart agent can gain one point at each time step ; ( ii ) @xmath97 , the smart agents can averagely gain profit from the producers ; ( iii ) @xmath98 , the smart agent can not gain profit and are characterized by the overall loss described by * eq.*(1 ) .    [ 0.3 ] time evolution of @xmath47 ( a ) and @xmath99 ( b ) , where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the value of @xmath47 and @xmath99 shown in these two figures is the average of 32 independent experiments and the horizontal line in figure ( a ) represents @xmath50.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the above picture is confirmed by the numerical simulation result shown in figure 3(a ) .",
    "one can find that @xmath0 decreases as @xmath10 increases and decays to 0.25 when @xmath10 is sufficiently large .",
    "figure 3(b ) plots the time dependence of the mean gain for smart agents : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 denote the number of smart agents who win and lose , respectively .",
    "initially , @xmath99 is negative , but as @xmath10 increases , @xmath99 becomes positive .",

    ", one immediately finds that the smart agents perform much better than the conventional agents .",
    "this is an evidence that it may be not reasonable to use the conventional agents to mimic the actual traders in real - life markets .",
    "we propose a new model of minority game with so - called smart agents , who use trail and error method to make a choice .",
