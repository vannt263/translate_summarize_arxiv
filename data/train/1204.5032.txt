    "the strongly correlated electron system shows a rich phase diagram around an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point .",

    "on the other hand , for other compounds , the same f - electron plays both roles of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in correlated metal .    since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity of cerhin@xmath0 in 2000",
    ", this compound has been investigated intensively by many measurements under pressure . in the ambient pressure ,",
    "the compound shows the antiferromagnetic phase around 3.8 k , in which the staggered moments of 0.6 @xmath6/ce parallel in the a - b plane align with an ordering wave vector ( @xmath7)@xcite . the antiferromagnetic transition temperature decreases with applying pressure . above 2 gpa",
    ", unconventional superconductivity has been observed below 2.1 k.    in the superconducting state of other compound with the same crystal structure cecoin@xmath0 , the so - called resonance peak has been observed by the inelastic neutron scattering experiment@xcite . a coexistent phase of antiferromagnetism and unconventional superconductivity is also suggested by the nuclear - quadrupole - resonance ( nqr ) measurement@xcite .",
    "recently , the magnetic neutron diffraction@xcite and nqr measurements@xcite have been carried out under the pressure to study the compound around the coexistent phase .",
    "the magnetic neutron diffraction measurement has showed a change of magnetic ordering wave vector from the original one at the ambient pressure to ( @xmath8 ) in the low temperature region above 1.5 gpa .",
    "this implies that an additional spin mode different from the original one at the ambient pressure exists in low energy spectra . actually , the evidence of this from different measurement is an upturn of nqr relaxation rate devided by temperature @xmath9 in the low temperature limit at 1.3 gpa , where the compound will be in the original magnetic state .",
    "it should be noted that the nqr spectrum in the coexistent phase is reproduced well by an assumption of the commensurate magnetic ordering .",
    "further , the value of @xmath9 in the low temperature limit in the coexistent phase at 1.5 gpa is two orders larger than that in the superconducting phase at 2.3 gpa , where the quantity becomes temperature independent in the low temperature limit of both phases .",
    "the main motivation of our study is to clarify the low energy spin excitation around the coexistent phase of antiferromagnetism and unconventional superconductivity . in the antiferromagnetic phase",
    ", the antiferromagnetic spin wave appears as a goldstone mode in the rotationally symmetric spin system . on the other hand ,",
    "the resonance mode is observed around an antiferromagnetic ordering wave vector in unconventional superconductors . in the coexistent phase ,",
    "both collective modes are expected .",
    "further , recalling the analysis of nqr spectrum in the coexistent phase , the reason of the stabilization of the coexistent phase with the commensurate magnetic ordering is required .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : self - consistent equations ] , we introduce the mean - field hamiltonian with both of the af exchange and the bcs interaction terms and present the self - consistent solution in the coexisting state of the af and the sc order . in section  [ sec : dynamical spin susceptibility ] , we carry out the calculations of the dynamical spin susceptibility in the presence of the af and the sc long - range order . section  [ sec : local spin dynamics ] shows the nmr relaxation rate @xmath10 in the coexistence(co ) phase . section  [ sec : conclusion ] is a conclusion .",
    "we put some technical details in appendixes .",
    "in this section , we introduce an effective hamiltonian describing the co phase of antiferromagnetism and @xmath1-wave superconductivity in a quasi - two - dimentional system , which will be a simplified version of cerhin@xmath0 , and show the one electronic state in the co phase . recalling that the staggered moment is observed in the antiferromagnetic state of the compound , the antiferromagnetic phase is a metallic state with the fermi surface .",
    "further , it has been shown by a detail analysis of the inelastic neutron scattering data that other compound cecoin@xmath0 with the same crystal structure shows @xmath11- superconductivity at 2.3 k in the ambient pressure@xcite .",
    "since the superconducting phase of cerhin@xmath0 appears around the antiferromagnetic phase and the transition temperature is quite close to that of cecoin@xmath0 , the @xmath11-symmetry of superconductivity in cerhin@xmath0 is plausible . assuming the single orbital for electronic state in the unit cell of the paramagnetic phase for simplicity , the effective hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the kinetic energy , the interaction of @xmath1-wave pairing , and the antiferromagnetic heisenberg - type spin exchange terms , respectively .",

    "@xmath34 is the normal green s function , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the anomalous green s functions associated to the antiferromagnetism and the superconductivity , respectively .",
    "the last green s function @xmath37 proportional to the two different order parameters takes a non - zero value only in the co phase , and is the so - called @xmath38-triplet pairing .",
    "following the symmetry arguments given in table  [ pairsym ] , the @xmath38-triplet pairing is clarified as an antisymmetric pairing in two sublattices . since the pair of two electrons is a wave function of two electrons , it is antisymmetric for the exchange of the two electrons . in the paramagnetic state , this antisymmetry is satisfied in the spin - singlet pairing with even parity or the spin - triplet pairing with odd parity . on the other hand ,",
    "the sublattice index is additionally necessary in the phase with the antiferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "therefore , the spin - triplet and sublattice - antisymmetric pairing with even parity and the spin - singlet and sublattice - antisymmetric pairing with odd parity are also possible in the coexistent phase .",
    "since the parity is preserved , the spin - triplet and sublattice - antisymmetric pairing with even parity is induced in the present case .    .",

    "the neutron diffraction experiment shows that the ordering wave vector approaches from an incommensurate one at the ambient pressure @xmath39 to another incommensurate one @xmath40 closer to the commensurate one at 1.48 gpa@xcite .",
    "similarly , it has been reported that the nqr spectrum also change a broad shape interpreted by assuming an incommensurate order at the ambient pressure to a sharp peak form explained by the commensurate order at 1.86 gpa , where this compound is in the coexistent phase in the low temperature region@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown by the dhva experiment that the @xmath41-electronic character also changes from the localized one at ambient pressure to an itinerant one above 2.3gpa due the kondo effect@xcite . considering these , switching of the ordering wave vector from the incommensurate to",
    "the commensurate one seems to be attributed to the kondo coupling between the @xmath41- and conduction - electrons , which changes the shape of the fermi surface of the quasi - particles .",
    "now , the sharp incommensurate spin excitation intensity at @xmath42 shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) means an instability of the commensurate antiferromagnetism , though the order parameter is of the commensurate antiferromagnetism . around the instability , the free energy of corresponding incommensurate antiferromagnetic state may be lower than that of the commensurate one so that an first - order phase transition from the commensurate to the incommensurate ones is expected in our model . then , the incommensurate antiferromagnetic state will have some similarity with the incommensurate ordered state observed by the neutron diffraction measurement under the pressure , because heavy quasi - particles around the fermi level will be responsible for the incommensurate antiferromagnetism , where the itinerant picture using quasi - particles will be applicable .",
    "in addition , it is desirable to observe the spin resonance mode characteristic of the coexistent phaes as shown in fig .",
    "the dashed line means the on - site coulomb repulsion u.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     finally , we give another consideration on how the coexistent phase with the commensurate magnetic order is stabilized .",
    "as the stability of coexistent phase has been already discussed , the sign of a coupling term , like @xmath43 between two types of order parameters in the free energy , determines whether the coexistent state is favorable ( sign ) or not ( + sign)@xcite .",
    "similarly , the magnitude of the @xmath38-triplet pairing @xmath37 will give an important information , because the @xmath38-triplet pairing is proportional to the product of two different order parameters within the mean - field theory . beyond the mean - field theory ,",
    "a diagram shown in  [ ftq1 ] contributes to the @xmath38-triplet pairing as follows , @xmath44 since the spin fluctuation exchange term includes the spin - wave mode , the correction is expected to enhance the mean - field value of @xmath45 . through",

    "similarly , the dispersion relation of a quasi - particle branch @xmath70 is responsible for the @xmath65-temperature dependence below @xmath71 for @xmath67 , while the nqr relaxation rate shows the metalic behavior due to the existence of the fermi surface in the temperature range @xmath72 . for both cases",

    "the crossover temperature to @xmath75 will be determined by the effective coupling constant of impurity scattering . in our calculation , the @xmath62-linear behavior is originated from a small but finite imaginary part @xmath73 of frequency in the analytic continuation @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , considering the impurity scattering of quasi - particle , the self - energy correction will be given by @xmath77 in the present case , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the impurity density and the fourier transformed effective impurity potential , respectively .",
    "if the impurity is included in the sample , the residual density of states around the nodal points of the superconducting gap is induced by the impurity scattering .",
    "then , the korringa behavior is expected from the residual density of states  @xcite . here",
    ", considering the vertex correction by the spin fluctuation for the impurity scattering , the magnitude of effective impurity potential is enhanced  @xcite .",
    "the crossover temperature measured in the nqr experiment is almost independent of pressure varing from 1.82 to 2.35gpa , where the ground state changes from the coexistent state to the superconducting state by increasing pressure .",
    "thus , the contribution of the vertex correction by spin fluctuations will be small , because the pressure of 2.05gpa is really close to the critical pressure of the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point .",
    "we have formulated the spin - excitation spectrum in the coexistent phase of antiferromagnetism and @xmath1-wave superconductivity within rpa to calculate the low energy spin excitation .",
