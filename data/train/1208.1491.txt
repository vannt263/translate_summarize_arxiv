    "the amplitude of fluctuations in 3-point configurations is zero .",
    "it is therefore convenient to express the degree of non - gaussianity , @xmath8 , as a dimensionless ratio between the amplitude of the bispectrum , @xmath9 , and power spectrum , @xmath10 , of the fluctuations of the total potential @xmath11 : @xmath12}. \\label{eq : fnldef}\\ ] ]    one can denote the portion of the potential that can be described as a gaussian random field as @xmath13 and assume that @xmath14 is a function of the potential ( i.e. , that it is ` local ' ) . to 2nd order , this approach yields @xmath15 for this simplest treatment and evaluating eq .

    "@xcite have shown that , for standard , single - field inflation , the amplitude of the bispectrum in the `` squeezed '' limit becomes vanishingly small , and thus any detected scale - dependent bias at large - scales would disprove all single - field models , subject to the condition that the field starts in the vacuum .",
    "therefore , measurements of the large - scale clustering of galaxies have the potential to yield significant insight into the physical mechanism that drove inflation .",
    "primordial non - gaussianity can also be measured from the bispectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and , in principle , galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have indeed found larger than expected clustering amplitudes at large scales , using photometric sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) data .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the excess found in @xcite was due , at least partially , to stellar contamination , and that systematics correlated with the galaxy ( e.g. , stellar density and galactic extinction ) may impart spurious clustering signal at large scales .",

    "general relativistic ( gr ) corrections are also expected to cause features in the clustering of galaxies at the largest ( super - horizon ) scales .",
    "these effects are expected to be small compared to that of @xmath2 , as , e.g. , @xcite find that the effects of @xmath2 on the power spectrum dominate gr corrections for @xmath27 .",
    "we analyze the sdss data release nine ( dr9 ; @xcite ) baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; @xcite ) `` cmass '' sample of galaxies .",
    "this sample has the largest effective volume @xcite of any spectroscopic survey and comprises approximately 1/3 of the final ( planned ) boss cmass sample .",
    "the clustering of this data set has been extensively studied ( @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the sample has been simulated with 600 mock galaxy catalogs @xcite and the issues identified by @xcite have been addressed via the application of an un - biased weighting scheme @xcite .",

    "the dr9 cmass sample is smaller than existing photometric redshift samples of galaxies and quasars ( existing quasar samples have roughly 20 times the volume ) . given that @xmath2 imparts a change in the expected clustering measurements that is most pronounced at large scales and is smoothly varying , we should not expect @xmath2 constraints from the dr9 cmass sample to be competitive even with those one could obtain with the sdss data release eight @xcite photometric redshift sample created in @xcite ( which has approximately 3 times the angular footprint of our data set and was trained using early boss redshifts ) , let alone a photometric quasar sample .",
    "however , we expect our study to have best - quantified the impact of systematics , given the analyses of @xcite .",

    "this sample has 264,283 galaxies spread over an effective area of 3275 deg@xmath0 , 2584 deg@xmath0 of which is in the north galactic cap .",
    "we use the 600 mock dr9 cmass catalogs ( henceforth `` mocks '' ) generated by @xcite to generate covariance matrices for clustering estimators . @xcite",
    "used the initial conditions of a flat cosmology defined by @xmath35 , and @xmath31 ( same as the fiducial cosmologies assumed in @xcite and @xcite ) and generated dark matter halo fields at redshift 0.55 .",
    "these simulations were produced using a 2nd - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 2lpt ) approach inspired by the perturbation theory halos ( pthalos ; @xcite ) model .",
    "galaxies were placed in halos using the halo occupation distribution determined from measurements of the correlation function of cmass galaxies and the parameterization of @xcite . the dr9 angular footprint was then applied and galaxies were sampled along the radial direction such that the mean @xmath36 matched the cmass @xmath36 , thereby providing 600 catalogs simulating the observed dr9 cmass sample .",
    "see @xcite for further details .",
    "the mocks have @xmath22 and we describe how we account for this in our covariance matrices in section [ sec : cov ] .",
    "as shown in , e.g. , @xcite , primordial non - gaussianity alters the expected mass function of dark matter halos , with positive @xmath2 yielding more high - mass dark matter halos .",
    "as outlined in both @xcite and @xcite , this causes a scale dependent bias in the power spectrum of dark matter halos .",

    "we restrict our analysis to @xmath55mpc@xmath40 , where our linear model is expected to be a valid approximation , as is justified via comparison to the results of mock dr9 cmass samples described in section [ sec : pmeas ] .",
    "various studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have shown that non - zero @xmath2 produces corrections to the scale - dependent and -independent halo bias that are more complicated functions of halo mass ( and age ) than the simple model we have presented above .",
    "further , @xcite and @xcite show that higher - order contributions to the ( non - gaussian ) primordial potential may bias determinations of @xmath2 .",
    "these concerns suggest that measurements of @xmath2 using the techniques we describe above may be biased and that any precise determination of @xmath2 must consider these effects .",
    "however , in all of the models , detection of non - zero @xmath2 should occur only when there is local non - gaussianity in the primordial potential .",
    "the values we determine should be viewed as effective @xmath2 values , but we expect the relative importance of systematic biases imparted by observational effects to be independent of these model concerns .",
    "we measure the power spectrum , @xmath56 , using the standard fourier technique of @xcite , as described in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , we calculate the spherically - averaged power in @xmath6 bands of width @xmath57mpc@xmath40 using a 2048@xmath58 grid . for all measurements we present ,",
    "the galaxies are weighted to account for missing close - pairs ( the boss spectrographs can not simultaneously observe objects separated by less than 62@xmath34 ) and redshift failures . we also apply weights to account for the systematic relationship between target galaxy density and stellar density , and compare to results when these weights are not applied .",
    "we label measurements made using the stellar density weights as @xmath59 , and treat these as the fiducial measurements .",
    "we label those made without the stellar density weights as @xmath60 .",
    "finally , we apply ` fkp ' ( standing for feldman - kaiser - peacock ) weights to both galaxies and randoms using the prescription of @xcite , which amounts to a redshift - dependent weighting in our application .",

    "negative @xmath2 actually causes an enhancement of the power spectrum ; this is due to the fact that the term proportional to the square of @xmath2 dominates and thus the square of the total bias becomes larger than in the case of @xmath83 .",

    "the measurement depends strongly on the underlying @xmath51 at larger @xmath6 and @xmath65 , and their ability to constrain @xmath2 is much weaker than one naively expects .",
    "we compare the measured power spectrum , @xmath56 , of cmass galaxies to model @xmath85 , which combine the theoretical galaxy power spectrum convolved with the cmass window function and a term @xmath86 ( described below ) to model the contribution of systematics to the measured power .",
    "@xcite found that a weight for stellar density had a large effect on the measured low-@xmath6 cmass power spectrum .",
    "we assume that the correction for potential systematics always has the same form , but the magnitude of the correction can vary .",

    "we apply weights to account for the systematic effect of stars when we determine the power spectrum .",
    "these weights were determined via a linear fit to the relationship between the target galaxy density and the stellar density .",
    "we can estimate the uncertainty on @xmath86 by determining these weights for each of the 600 mocks ( which have no intrinsic systematic relationship ) .",
    "this analysis was performed in @xcite , where @xmath29 was measured for each mock sample with weights determined and applied in each individual case .",
    "the weights did not bias the mean of the measurements or the variance ( see their fig .",
    "a2 ) , but each individual measurement was given a nearly constant bias with standard deviation 1.5@xmath91 .",
    "this standard deviation on the bias is 10% the size of difference between the unweighted , @xmath92 , and weighted cmass @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , we expect the statistical uncertainty on @xmath86 to be 0.1 for the dr9 cmass sample , and we believe allowing any value of @xmath86 accounts for additional , unknown systematic effects .",
    "previous dr9 studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) used measurements of the power spectra of 600 mock realizations of the cmass sample to construct the covariance matrix .",
    "these mock realizations are for @xmath22 . for a constant number density , @xmath93 , the total variance is expected to scale as ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath94 the value of @xmath2 significantly alters the expected power spectrum at low @xmath6 , and thus we expect the amplitude of the covariance to depend significantly on the true value of @xmath2 .",
    "the number density for the dr9 cmass sample is @xmath95mpc@xmath96 and its measured power spectrum is greater than 2.5@xmath97mpc@xmath58 across all of the scales we consider .",

    "width=317 ]    we measure the correlation function , @xmath138 for the observed dr9 cmass sample using the standard @xcite estimator given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 represents the data sample ( i.e. , boss galaxies ) and @xmath141 represents the random sample ( occupying the angular footprint and with the same redshift distribution as the data sample ) and the paircounts are normalized to the total number .",
    "we use a linear spaced binning in @xmath142 of 7 @xmath143mpc , and the measurements are the same as those presented in @xcite .    by definition",
    ", the correlation function integrates to zero : @xmath144 when estimating the correlation function , this condition holds , but we do not have an infinite volume .",
    "instead the condition becomes a sum over the pairs from which @xmath145 is determined @xmath146 thus , for any particular model @xmath147 , we can compute the deviation from this condition as @xmath148 and thus the total model to compare to the measurement is @xmath149 . for our fiducial model , and a bias of 1.9 , it is @xmath150 , but for @xmath134 50 , it is @xmath151 ( for reference , the standard deviation of the @xmath29 computed from the mock catalogs is an order of magnitude larger , e.g. , it is 0.002 at @xmath152mpc ) .    using the correlation function ( as opposed to the power power spectrum ) measurements presents additional challenges for the covariance matrix that is applied .",
    "the amplitude of the measurements are generally expected to cross zero just beyond the bao scale , and where they are close to zero we should not expect the fractional error to be conserved for alternative models .",
    "we thus use @xmath29 and its covariance , as determined from the 600 mocks , accepting that this may be inaccurate for large @xmath2 , but that the results will still be useful for comparison . further , the model @xmath29 has two nuisance parameters , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , that the power spectrum does not have . for the results we present , we marginalize over these parameters , as in @xcite , but we find less than a 10% variation in the width and maximum of likelihood distribution when we fix the damping scale to the value used in @xcite .    fig .",

    "each prefer positive @xmath2 at greater than 68% confidence , but allow @xmath160 at greater than 5% .",
    "as expected , the two estimators recover consistent results . however , the probability distribution is considerably wider for the correlation function measurements .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the maximum effective scale probed is much larger for the power - spectrum measurements , for which the data compression at large scales is more effective .",
