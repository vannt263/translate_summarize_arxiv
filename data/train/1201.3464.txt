    "the production of heavy quarkonium at hadron colliders provides useful laboratory for testing the high - energy limit of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as well as the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative phenomena in qcd .",
    "the total collision energies , @xmath6  tev and 1.96  tev in tevatron runs  i and ii , respectively , and @xmath7  tev or 14  tev at the lhc , sufficiently exceed the characteristic scale @xmath8 of the relevant hard processes , which is of order of quarkonium transverse mass @xmath9 , _ i.e. _  we have @xmath10 . in this high - energy regime , so called `` regge limit '' , the contribution of partonic subprocesses involving @xmath11-channel parton ( gluon or quark ) exchanges to the production cross section can become dominant",
    ". then the transverse momenta of the incoming partons and their off - shell properties can no longer be neglected , and we deal with `` reggeized '' @xmath11-channel partons .",
    "these @xmath1channel exchanges obey multi - regge kinematics ( mrk ) , when the particles produced in the collision are strongly separated in rapidity .",
    "if the same situation is realized with groups of particles , then quasi - multi - regge kinematics ( qmrk ) is at work . in the case of @xmath0meson inclusive production",
    ", this means the following : @xmath0meson ( mrk ) or @xmath4-meson plus gluon jet ( qmrk ) is produced in the central region of rapidity , while other particles are produced with large modula of rapidities .    the parton reggeization approach ( pra ) @xcite is particularly appropriate for high - energy phenomenology .",
    "we see , the assumption of a dominant role of mrk or qmrk production mechanisms at high energy works well .",
    "pra is based on an effective quantum field theory implemented with the non - abelian gauge - invariant action including fields of reggeized gluons @xcite and reggeized quarks @xcite .",
    "reggeized partons interact with quarks and yang - mills gluons in a specific way .",
    "recently , in ref.@xcite , the feynman rules for the effective theory of reggeized gluons were derived for the induced and some important effective vertices .",
    "this approach was successfully applied to interpret the production of isolated jets @xcite , prompt photons @xcite , diphotons @xcite , charmed mesons @xcite , bottom - flavored jets @xcite measured at the fermilab tevatron , at the desy hera and at the cern lhc , in the small-@xmath12 regime , where @xmath13 .",
    "we suggest the mrk ( qmrk ) production mechanism to be the dominant one at small @xmath12 values . using the feynman rules for the effective theory",
    ", we can construct heavy quarkonium production amplitudes in framework of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd)@xcite .",
    "the factorization formalism of the nrqcd is a rigorous theoretical framework for the description of heavy - quarkonium production and decay .",
    "the factorization hypothesis of nrqcd assumes the separation of the effects of long and short distances in heavy - quarkonium production .",
    "nrqcd is organized as a perturbative expansion in two small parameters , the strong - coupling constant @xmath2 and the relative velocity @xmath3 of the heavy quarks inside a heavy quarkonium .",
    "our previous analysis of charmonium @xcite and bottomonium @xcite production at the fermilab tevatron using the high - energy factorization scheme and nrqcd approach has shown the efficiency of such type of high - energy phenomenology . in this paper",
    "we repeat our calculations for the direct and prompt @xmath0meson transverse momentum spectra at the fermilab tevatron @xcite to obtain by fitting procedure octet nonperturbative matrix elements ( nmes ) , than we calculate prompt @xmath0meson spectra , which were measured recently at the cern lhc collider at the energy of @xmath5 tev .",

    "the uncertainties from errors in the color - octet nmes are small , they are about 7 - 10% .    moving on from tevatron to the lhc , which is currently running at the total energy being about 3.5 times larger than at the tevatron , we expect the range of validity of our approach to be extended by the same factor , to @xmath95 gev , as we describe well the tevatron data at the range of @xmath96 gev .",

    "at the same time our theoretical result overestimates the data of at most factor 2 in the range of large rapidity @xmath104 .",
    "this distinction is expected in the parton reggeization approach , because the multi - regge kinematics conditions to be broken if @xmath4 mesons are produced with large rapidity .",
    "we observe , in fig .",
    "10 , that relative contributions of the color - singlet ( curve 1 ) and color - octet ( curve 2 ) production mechanisms to the prompt @xmath4 spectrum strongly depend on the @xmath4 transverse momentum . similarly to the nlo calculations in the collinear parton model , the color - octet contribution dominates at the large @xmath12 region , basically via the contributions of the color - octet nmes @xmath105\\rangle$ ] and @xmath106\\rangle$ ] .",
    "it is significant , the experimental data @xcite depend on the assumption of polarization of produced @xmath4 mesons slightly .",
    "we perform calculations and make a comparison to the data in a case of non - polarized @xmath4 meson production .    comparing our results with the recent studies of @xmath4 meson hadroproduction in the conventional collinear pm , which were performed in full nlo approximation of nrqcd formalism @xcite or in the non - complete nnlo@xmath107 approximation of color - singlet model @xcite",
    ", we should emphasize the following . at first , oppositely to nlo and nnlo@xmath107 calculations , which provide a good description of data only at non - small @xmath88 gev , we can reproduce data well at all transverse momenta @xmath12 . at second , the present study along with the previous investigations in the parton reggeization approach @xcite demonstrate the important role of ( quasi)multi - regge kinematics in particle production at high energies , this feature is out of account in the collinear pm .",
    "such a way , we find the approach based on the effective theory of reggeized partons @xcite and high - energy factorization scheme with unintegrated pdfs , which in the large logarithmic terms ( @xmath108 ) are resummed in all orders of strong coupling constant @xmath2 , to be more adequate for the description of experimental data than fixed order in @xmath2 calculations in the frameworks of collinear pm .",
    "the fermilab tevatron and , even more so , the cern lhc are currently probing particle physics at terascale c.m .",
    "energies @xmath109 , so that the hierarchy @xmath10 , which defines the mrk and qmrk regimes , is satisfied for processes of heavy quark and heavy quarkonium production in the central region of rapidity , where @xmath8 is of order of their transverse mass . in this paper , we studied qcd processes of particular interest , namely prompt @xmath4 hadroproduction , at los in the parton reggeization approach and nrqcd approach , in which they are mediated by @xmath52 and @xmath39 partonic subprocesses initiated by reggeized gluon collisions .",
