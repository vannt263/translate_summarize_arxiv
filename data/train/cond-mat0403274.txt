    "scaling theories are invaluable tools in the theory of quantum critical phenomena @xcite .",

    "we study the extension of scaling ideas to quantum first order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "although there is no diverging length in these transitions , this has proved to be very useful  @xcite for temperature driven transitions and will turn out to be also the case for discontinuous quantum transitions .",
    "let us consider the scaling form of the @xmath0 free energy density close to the quantum phase transition , @xmath1 where @xmath2 measures the distance to the transition at @xmath3 .",

    "the total internal energy close to the transition can be written as , @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "then the existence of a first order phase transition at @xmath0 with a discontinuity in @xmath11 and a _ latent heat _ implies the value @xmath12 for this critical exponent .",

    "if the quantum transition is driven , for example , by pressure , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a critical pressure and a finite _ latent heat _ means in this case a finite amount of work , @xmath22 , to bring one phase into another .",
    "such finite _ latent work _ is associated with a change in volume since the intensive variable , pressure in this case , remains constant at the transition . in the case of a density driven first order transition the chemical potential remains fixed while the number of particles changes .    in the next sections we study two problems which present first order quantum transitions and confirm the results obtained above on the basis of scaling arguments .",

    "[ fig2 ] we conclude that there are _ two relevant scales _ for the present problem in the disordered phase ( @xmath62 , @xmath94 ) . for @xmath95 , the thermal contribution to the effective potential vanishes exponentially as can be easily checked . for @xmath96 , which corresponds to high temperatures @xmath88 saturates , @xmath97 . in this case the effective potential , @xmath98 which can be cast in the scaling form , @xmath99\\ ] ] with the critical exponent @xmath12 and the characteristic temperature , @xmath100 this is similar to that of continuous quantum phase transitions , where @xmath101  @xcite but with @xmath13 confirming the expectations of our previous discussion .",
    "notice that in the present problem , the mass @xmath102 ( or @xmath42 ) , the control parameter itself , provides the natural cut - off for breakdown of scaling along the temperature axis . the two characteristic energies @xmath87 and @xmath42 , the scaling temperature and the cut - off scale are general features expected to play a role near quantum discontinuous transitions .    the quantum mechanical problem of two coexisting phases at @xmath103 , the superconductor and the insulator , can be described by a double wave function @xmath104 . in the probability density @xmath105 , the coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the relative proportions of each phase .",
    "the interference term may have experimental significance as one of the phases has macroscopic coherence . even if the overlap between the wave functions vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , at the first order transition it may give rise to finite corrections as the system is made up of finite domains due to the avoided criticality .",
    "the transition investigated above is a special case of quantum first order transitions referred as fluctuation induced first order transitions . from the scaling analysis we expect however that the result @xmath108 holds generally for transitions with a latent heat . as an example that this is the case we investigate the biquadratic spin-1 chain  @xcite , @xmath109 with @xmath110 at @xmath111 there is a zero temperature first order phase transition where two spontaneously dimerized ground states exchange stability  @xcite .",
    "the ground state energy can be written as @xmath112 consistent with @xmath12 and the latent heat @xmath113 can be exactly obtained  @xcite . furthermore in this case the correlation length exponent has been directly obtained from finite lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "the numerical value , @xmath114 agrees with the expected value @xmath115 since for this transition @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the effects of disorder on classical first order transitions have been extensively studied  @xcite . here",
    "we must distinguish weak or fluctuation - induced first order transitions from strong first order transitions which map into the random field problem  @xcite since disorder couples to the order parameter . in the latter case a criterion for the role of disorder based on domain wall arguments can be easily generalized to quantum systems . in analogy with the random field problem  @xcite , we define a generalized stiffness @xmath116 associated with the ( continuous ) symmetry - broken phase  @xcite , which scales as @xmath117 close to the strong coupling attractor of this phase . in this equation @xmath118 is the scaling factor and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively the dimension and the dynamical critical exponent discussed earlier . at this fixed point",
    "the random field scales as @xmath119  @xcite , and their ratio @xmath120 if @xmath121 the fixed point at @xmath122 is stable and a critical amount of disorder is required to destroy the ordered phase . as concerns the first order transition this implies that the coexistence of phases is possible at least for sufficiently weak disorder . in the opposite case ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath123 disorder destroys the first order character of the transition since there can be no coexistence and one phase grows at the expenses of the other .",
    "the case @xmath124 is marginal and requires specific calculations . for the biquadratic chain discussed above @xmath125 and any amount of disorder",
    "drives this system to a random singlet phase associated with an infinite disorder fixed point as has been shown using a perturbative renormalization group calculation  @xcite .    in the case of fluctuation",
    "induced quantum first order transitions we find no general criterion as for the standard case .",
    "for the problem treated here of a superconductor coupled to a gauge field , boyanovsky and cardy  @xcite have shown that to order @xmath126 , at least for weak disorder , this transition remains first order .",
    "we have investigated quantum first order transitions using scaling ideas and looking at two specific cases . in both cases there",
    "is a discontinuity in the first derivative of the ground state energy equivalent to a latent heat associated with the transition .",
    "therefore , as in classical transitions , we have @xmath12 which allows the definition of the correlation length exponent @xmath108 for the quantum case .",
    "the consideration of the problem of the superconductor coupled to a gauge field has been important to clarify the meaning of a scaling approach in a system where criticality is avoided .",
    "we have studied the effects of disorder in these transitions in the case this couples to fluctuations of the order parameter . a simple criterion to determine if the first order nature of the quantum transition is modified by disorder is discussed ."
