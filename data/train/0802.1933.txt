    "the nonextensive statistics is a generalization of the boltzmann ",
    "gibbs one and it is based on the nonadditive entropy @xcite    @xmath5    where @xmath2 is the entropic index for a specific system , connected to its dynamics , as recently proposed @xcite ; @xmath6 are probabilities satisfying @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a constant , and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the boltzmann  gibbs entropy . in this statistics ,",
    "a system composed of two independent parts @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in the sense that the probabilities of the systems factorize , has the following pseudo - additivity ( nonextensivity ) property of the entropy @xcite",
    "@xmath13    this pseudo - additivity is related to the composability property of @xmath14 @xcite . since for any system @xmath15",
    ", then @xmath16 correspond to superadditivity ( superextensivity ) , @xmath17 to additivity ( extensivity ) , and @xmath18 to subadditivity ( subextensivity ) .",
    "besides representing a generalization , @xmath14 , as much as @xmath10 , is positive , concave and lesche - stable ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "recently , it has been shown that it is also extensive for some kinds of correlated systems in which scale invariance prevails @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report some results of a monte carlo simulation of a 2d ising model upon replacing the statistics of the metropolis algorithm by the nonextensive statistics . from numerical calculations",
    "we compute the magnetization of the system , and built a @xmath1phase diagram showing that , even for @xmath0 , exist phase transitions , in contrast to a previous work @xcite .",
    "the text is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the equilibrium distribution of nonextensive statistics and the importance of the internal energy constrains . in section 3",
    ", we describe the introduction of the nonextensive formalism into the monte carlo method . in sections 4 and 5",
    ", we discuss the main results and describe the behavior of the critical temperature with the entropic index in a phase diagram ( @xmath20 vs. @xmath2 ) .",
    "to calculate the equilibrium distribution , the above entropy , eq.([eq.01 ] ) , must be maximized @xcite .",
    "if the system is isolated , i.e. , in a microcanonical ensemble ,    @xmath21    the maximization yields equiprobability of states occupation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the system is in contact with a thermal reservoir ( canonical ensemble ) , it is necessary to add the internal energy constraints , which can be done according to three possible choices .",
    "the first one is @xcite    @xmath22    the standard definition of internal energy in which @xmath23 are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the second , as postulated in @xcite , is :    @xmath24    both definitions presents some difficulties with the interpretation of some results @xcite .",
    "thus , a third choice for the internal energy constraint was introduced as @xcite :    @xmath25    which defined the escort probability ( first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    @xmath26    the maximization of @xmath14 in that case yields for the probability distribution    @xmath27^{1/(1-q)}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath28^{1/(1-q)}\\ ] ]    is the nonextensive partition function and @xmath29 a lagrange multiplier . after some algebraic manipulations @xcite it becomes :    @xmath30^{1/(1-q ) } = \\frac{1}{z_{q}^{\\prime}}\\,e_{q}^{-\\beta^{\\prime}\\varepsilon_{i}}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath31^{1/(1-q ) } = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\omega}e_{q}^{-\\beta^{\\prime}\\varepsilon_{i}}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath32    and @xmath33 is the generalized exponential , which has the following the property :    @xmath34^{1/(1-q ) } = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll }           e_{q}^{-\\,x } , & \\mbox{if $ 1-(1-q)\\,x \\geq 0$};\\\\           0 , & \\mbox{if $ 1-(1-q)\\,x < 0$}.\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    known as the tsallis cutoff procedure .",
    "a detailed discussion about the role of constraints within the nonextensive statistics was done by tsallis et al @xcite , but recently it has been showed by ferri et al @xcite the equivalence of all these formulations of internal energy constraints . in spite of that , in this work , to avoid misunderstanding , we choose the normalized internal energy form .",
    "the thermal equilibrium in the nonextensive statistics is still an open issue due to the definition of the physical temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , differently from some authors @xcite , in our approach the parameter @xmath35 is assumed to be the physical temperature , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "the validity of this choice was first shown experimentally @xcite , and latter theoretically @xcite for manganites .",
    "in this section we are going to discuss the modification of the metropolis method for the nonextensive statistics , considering a ferromagnetic 2d ising with first - neighbors interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 denotes the sum over first neighbors on a square lattice of size @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( ferromagnetic interaction ) .",
    "we proceed the single flip monte carlo calculations @xcite to obtain the magnetization of the system , however we have changed the usual statistical weight to :    @xmath42^{q}\\ ] ]    or , in other words , the ratio between the escort probabilities before and after the spin flip .",
    "since this quantity is a ratio , the normalization factor of the escort probabilities , i.e. , the generalized partition function , eq.([eq.11 ] ) , cancels and the weight calculated can be written as the ratio between the generalized exponentials raised to the entropic parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that @xmath43 is the quantity that will be compared to a random number in the metropolis algorithm ( see appendix for details on the mc procedure used ) .",
    "it is also important to note that the tsallis cutoff procedure , eq.([eq.13 ] ) , must be taken into account , i.e. , it must be included into @xmath43 to avoid complex probabilities .",
    "the simulations were done with the entropic parameter @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "lattice size were @xmath45 , with periodical boundary condition imposing that @xmath46 .",
    "the most probable normalized magnetization , @xmath47 , was obtained after @xmath48 monte carlo steps and are shown on fig.([figure1 ] ) for @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( which are representative results for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively ) , and for @xmath53 .",
    "one can observe that for @xmath54 there are strong influences of the lattice size on the shape of the magnetization curve and on the critical temperature , @xmath55 . in addition , the magnetization drops smoothly to zero close to @xmath55 due to the thermal fluctuations . on the contrary , for @xmath56 , there are no dependence of those quantities on the lattice size , and the magnetization changes suddenly at @xmath55 , from @xmath57 to @xmath58 . in other words , there are no thermal fluctuations in this case and the magnetization works like a microcanonic two - level system .",
    "it can be seen that the magnetization has no dependence on the lattice size , dropping form @xmath59 to @xmath60 suddenly at @xmath55 .",
    "it happens due to the contribution of the tsallis cutoff .",
    "however , for @xmath61 the magnetization depends on the lattice size and smoothly goes to zero close to @xmath55 as a second order phase transition .",
    "for @xmath17 it recovers the well known result . ]",
    "this behavior , for @xmath56 , is simple to be understood . at low temperatures ( for instance @xmath62 and @xmath49 ) ,",
    "the first monte carlo steps lead the magnetization to @xmath57 , i.e. , to the ground state , as expected ( due to the low temperatures ) .",
    "then the subsequent monte carlo steps attempt to invert the spin , but it fails because is energetically unfavorable .",
    "then the metropolis algorithm takes place ; as @xmath63 and @xmath64 , therefore @xmath65 for all @xmath66 .",
    "so , considering the cutoff , eq.([eq.13 ] ) , @xmath67 and then @xmath68 .",
    "since the metropolis algorithm flips energetically unfavorable spins if the random number is smaller then @xmath43 , for @xmath66 those spins never flips ( @xmath69 ) , keeping the magnetization at @xmath57 ; in other words , in the ground state .",
    "this situation persists up to @xmath70 , where the cutoff for @xmath71 is no longer satisfied and the thermal fluctuation can therefore acts .",
    "however , the spins are already quite warm and the magnetization drops suddenly to zero , i.e. , to a equiprobable state .",
    "a similar behavior was already found describing the generalized brillouin function @xcite .    to determine the critical temperature we must take the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath72 ) . in fig.([figura2 ] )",
    "we plot the critical temperature as a function of the inverse lattice size for different values of the entropic parameter , taking the limit ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "notice that the critical temperature for @xmath53 tends to onsager result and , as explained above , it does not depend on the lattice size for @xmath51 .",
    "similar independency were found in different systems @xcite .",
    "also , the slope of the curves changes with the entropic parameter @xmath2 , suggesting a dependence of the critical exponents on the entropic parameter ( for studies about this connection see for example @xcite ) .    with those critical temperature values",
    "we build a phase diagram shown in fig.([figura3 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath20 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "it is quite interesting because , in contrast to previous works @xcite , we found that for the monte carlo simulations of a 2d ising model in nonextensive statistics has phase transitions for @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that below the @xmath74 line the system is in the ground state and then @xmath57 . above this line",
    "there are two regions where the thermal fluctuation act : one above @xmath55 , i.e. , in the paramagnetic regime and , consequently , in the equiprobable state ; and the other regime lies between @xmath74 line and @xmath55 when the magnetization assume values between 0 and 1 .",
    "it is interesting that the slope of the critical temperature , @xmath75 , does not changes abruptly with the increase of the entropic parameter . for @xmath76",
    "the slope changes smoothly indicating that the spin is not warm enough and pass to a thermal distribution region before the equiprobable state .     and for @xmath54 .",
    "as can be seen , for @xmath77 the critical temperature has no dependence on the lattice size .",
    "it happens due to the contribution of the tsallis cutoff .",
    "however , for @xmath61 the lattice size dependence appears . for @xmath17",
    "the thermodynamical limit recovers the critical temperature of onsager result ( @xmath78^{-1}$ ] ) . ]",
    "phase diagram .",
    "the first one is the ferromagnetic ground state ( @xmath59 ) which is kept from zero kelvin until @xmath79 , due to the contribution of the tsallis cutoff .",
    "the second region has influence at the thermal distribution ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the third is the equiprobable paramagnetic state ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the error is smaller then the the size of those dots . ]",
    "in this work , we studied a ferromagnetic 2d ising model with first - neighbor interactions through a monte carlo simulation in which the metropolis algorithm was changed to the nonextensive statistics .",
    "magnetization as a function of the temperature for different values of @xmath2 were evaluated and we found phase transition for @xmath0 , in contrast to a previous work @xcite .",
    "this results arises due to the definition of the physical temperature .",
    "in addition , we also have showed the contribution of the tsallis cutoff is of great importance and rules the phase transition for @xmath51 .",
