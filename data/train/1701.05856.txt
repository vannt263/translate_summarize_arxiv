    "deuterium fractionation @xmath1 or d / h=[xd]/[xh ] represents the enhancement of d content in molecules ( the notation [ x ] stands for the relative abundance of chemical species x ) .",
    "@xmath1 for molecules in solar - system bodies and star - forming regions is often found to be much higher than the cosmic d / h abundance ratio of @xmath2 . to understand chemical processes in prestellar cores , protostellar envelopes , and protoplanetary discs , it is crucial to ` decipher ' the information contained in the measured @xmath1 values of molecules in different objects .",
    "deuterium fractionation in star - forming regions has recently become an increasingly active research field due to important observational , experimental , and theoretical advances .",
    "overviews are available in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "specific attention has been paid to deuterium fractionation of water by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the modeling work by @xcite and @xcite indicates that deuterium - rich ice molecules mostly are concentrated on the outer surface of ice mantles residing on interstellar or circumstellar grains . to put it another way ,",
    "ice molecules that are formed early in the evolution of a contracting cloud core ( e.g. , h@xmath0o ) typically have low @xmath1 , while species that are synthesized in the later stages of prestellar cores typically , and are abundant on the outer surface , have a high d content ( e.g. , ch@xmath3oh )",
    ". moreover , the molecules in bulk ice are chemically uncoupled from the chemical processes on the surface and in the gas .",
    "the average @xmath1 for bulk molecules is substantially lower than previously thought .",
    "the different deuteration of surface and bulk - ice molecules can only be reproduced with astrochemical models that consider bulk - ice species as a separate phase .",
    "recent deuterium chemistry models that consider this are those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former considers circumstellar envelopes in a physically detailed way and confirms that d / h is high for surface and low for bulk ice species .",
    "the monolayer structure of this model @xcite allowed these authors determining the detailed composition of ice as a function of ice depth , measured in monolayers .",
    "the above papers consider the icy mantles as rigid structures , where molecule diffusion and reactions occur only in the surface monolayer .",
    "however , photoprocessing of subsurface ice can be a major route for chemical synthesis . with the help of numerical simulations ,",
    "such processes have been studied by , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "chemical processing of bulk ice may introduce changes in the d / h ratio for icy species @xcite .",
    "therefore , the specific aim of the present study is to investigate the deuterium fractionation of circumstellar molecules by using a model that considers active subsurface ice chemistry . for this purpose ,",
    "a model was employed that considers time - dependent physical conditions in an infalling protostellar envelope ( sect.[mphys ] ) , ice depth - dependent composition of mantle layers on grains , and an extensive reaction network of deuterated molecules ( sect.[nchem ] ) .",
    "this model adds to the understanding of the processes that govern deuterium fractionation in gas , surface , and mantle in general ( sect.[r - dice ] ) , and for specific compounds ( sect.[rspec ] ) .",
    "the outcome of these studies is summarized in sect.[dconcl ] .",
    "our numerical simulation is based on the model ` alchemic - venta ' @xcite .",
    "a short description of the model is presented below ; it includes a detailed description for items that differ from @xcite",

    "chemical models tend to produce higher - than - observed maximum gas - phase abundances for major ice species , such as water , that are evaporating in the vicinity of a protostar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this discrepancy probably arises because the observations often have a limited resolution and sample a whole line - of - sight in the nebula . despite this , the observed molecular ratios , such as @xmath1 , can be reliable .",
    "the necessary condition is that most of the molecules of the observed species occur in regions with similar history and physical conditions .",
    "this can be verified by accurately evaluating the excitation temperatures of the different isotopologues @xcite . while calculated @xmath1 values are our main result , we also present calculated abundances .",
    "this allows evaluating whether the @xmath1 values are truly relevant .",
    "we compare the numerical simulation results against observed gas - phase molecular @xmath1 in low - mass protostars .",
    "it is assumed that the temporal evolution of calculated abundances may qualitatively represent a 1d spatial structure of the protostellar core @xcite .",
    "this means that higher temperatures in the warm - up stage of the model represent regions closer to the protostar .",
    "the observational data on abundance ratios for isotopologues of different species have been summarized in table[tab - obs ] . the calculated abundance and @xmath1 curves",
    "are shown graphically in figures including those in appendix  [ app - a ] ( available in electronic form ) .",
    "observations with only upper limits reported were not considered here .",
    "for some species ( e.g. , water ) , the temperature ranges for table[tab - obs ] were specified in the reference papers . for others",
    ", it was usually assumed that the excitation temperatures represent the lower limit of the kinetic temperature . because the excitation temperatures can be very low",
    ", this condition does not always constrain the temperature range .",
    "the temperature range indicated for molecular @xmath1 in table[tab - obs ] is only authors estimate to help classifying literature data for the purposes of the present paper .",
    "fig.[att - g1 ] shows that for gas - phase water and ammonia , there are several peaks in the deuterium fractionation ratios .",
    "the first peak occurs a few kyr before starbirth , when the remaining gaseous heavy molecules are being completely depleted during freeze - out .",
    "efficient deuterium enrichment occurs in the cold gas of the dense core @xcite .",
    "while this peak corresponds to phase  1 in our model , it might be relevant to the outer , colder parts of early circumstellar envelopes .",
    "the second peak at 0.14myr ( 22k ) coincides with the evaporation of solid n@xmath0 and co. these species re - appear in the gas phase and are partially converted to n@xmath0d@xmath6 and dco@xmath6 by the products of cosmic - ray - induced dissociation and ionization of h@xmath0 and he .",
    "n@xmath0d@xmath6 and dco@xmath6 then serve as deuteration agents .",
    "meanwhile , the presence of abundant co now removes the heavy isotopologues of h@xmath7 that were the main deuteration agents in the cold phase .",
    "the third , smaller peak at 0.2myr is caused by evaporation of methane and its d isotopologues .",
    "significant amounts of methane ice are in inner ice layers , near the grain nuclei and have to diffuse to the surface before evaporating .",
    "the total evaporation of methane takes almost 20kyr .",
    "methane can be transformed to ch@xmath7 by radicals and ions in the gas .",
    "most of these are generated by cosmic - ray induced dissociation and ionization of h@xmath0 and he .",
    "ch@xmath7 isotopologues are affected by reactions that are selective with respect to h and d atoms ( table 13 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the high deuteration of the abundant methane and its associated ions and radicals is transferred to other species via hydrogen atom exchanges or dispatchment of free h and d atoms . because of these factors , the @xmath1 peak , induced by methane evaporation , is about 50kyr long and ends only when most of ch@xmath8 has been converted to co.    this third @xmath1 peak is followed by a number of smaller peaks caused by the successive evaporation of other molecules , such as c@xmath0h@xmath0 , c@xmath0h@xmath8 , h@xmath0s , and ch@xmath3och@xmath3 .",
    "the gas - phase processing of these species enable additional gas - phase deuterium fractionation reaction chains .",
    "the final gas - phase @xmath1 peak at @xmath9myr ( 94k ) is related to the evaporation of water and ammonia themselves .",
    "the peak occurs before the bulk of these species has evaporated because deuterium - rich molecules are concentrated on the outer icy surface and evaporate first .",
    "after evaporation , @xmath1 is mainly governed by gas - phase chemistry , much like the case of methane . with the evaporation of water ,",
    "deuterated hydronium h@xmath3o@xmath6 replaces dco@xmath6 as the main molecular deuteration agent .",
    "similar @xmath1 peaks can be discerned for most of the other species .",
    "appendix fig .",
    "[ att - p1 ] shows the calculated results for other ( in)organic species observed in protostellar envelopes .",
    "in the protostellar phase  2 , we obtain a higher gas - phase d@xmath0o / hdo abundance ratio than hdo / h@xmath0o for most of the time ( cf .",
    "fig.[att - g1 ] ) , which agrees with the recent observations by @xcite .",
    "we did not find similar results among recent papers on modeling of deuterium chemistry in circumstellar envelopes @xcite .",
    "the cause of the high d@xmath0o / hdo abundance ratio is gas - phase chemistry  this ratio is inherited from the high deuteration of the trihydrogen cation .",
    "its four isotopologues h@xmath7 , h@xmath0d@xmath6 , hd@xmath10 , and d@xmath7 have almost equal relative abundances of @xmath11 at the beginning of phase  2 , thanks to the reactions proposed by @xcite .",
    "this deuterium enrichment is transferred to water and other molecules via ion - neutral reactions .",
    "because a significant part of many species , including water , is formed on surfaces via the addition of atomic d , the @xmath1 of these species never attains the high maximum values characteristic for purely gas - phase products , such as the formyl cation ( dco@xmath6/hco@xmath12 per cent at 0.14myr ) or diazenylium ( n@xmath0d@xmath6/n@xmath0h@xmath13 per cent ) .",
    "deuterated analogues of several coms ",
    "methanol ch@xmath3oh , formaldehyde h@xmath0co , dimethyl ether ch@xmath3och@xmath3 , and methyl formate hcooch@xmath3  have been observed near low - mass protostars ( table[tab - obs ] ) .",

    "the lowest @xmath1 margin from observations is 10 per cent .",
    "this number is nominally reached in the model at @xmath14myr and @xmath15k . at this temperature",
    ", methanol does not evaporate yet and its gas - phase relative abundance is below @xmath16 .",
    "this is orders of magnitudes lower than its maximum calculated abundance of @xmath17 during evaporation at 124k . at these later stages ,",
    "@xmath1 for ch@xmath0doh is only about 0.1 to 1 per cent .",
    "this discrepancy means that our model does not adequately reproduce the ch@xmath0doh / ch@xmath3oh abundance ratio .",
    "a major reason for this disagreement is the synthesis of deuterium - poor methanol in bulk ice .",
    "the synthesis of more than 90 per cent methanol ch@xmath3oh , dimethyl ether ch@xmath3och@xmath3 , and methyl formate hcooch@xmath3 molecules occurs in the subsurface bulk ice layers @xcite .",
    "the latter two species have also gas - phase formation pathways that become effective when methanol and formaldehyde have evaporated @xcite .",
    "we use the low activation energies for co hydrogenation from @xcite .",
    "this allows to reproduce the abundances of methanol and its daughter species . at the same time",
    ", formaldehyde h@xmath0co is largely consumed in ice before evaporation and is unable to reach the high relative abundance of about @xmath18 observed in protostellar envelopes @xcite .",
    "formaldehyde is produced in gas - phase to attain a relative abundance of nearly 10@xmath19 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the deuterium fractionation of formaldehyde h@xmath0co is reproduced in our model , which has been a problem for some of the previous models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly to the case of d@xmath0o , the high efficiency of formaldehyde deuteration is thanks to to gas - phase chemistry with the network of @xcite .",
    "the deuteration of carbon - chain species is reproduced correctly ( cf .",
    "table[tab - obs ] and fig .",
    "[ att - p3 ] ) .",
    "the abundances and deuteration of some organic species become almost steady after the evaporation events , thanks to high - temperature ion - neutral reactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our model ,",
    "carbon chains are formed mainly in reactions on grain outer surfaces .",
    "exceptions are cyanides hc@xmath3n and hc@xmath20n ( also inorganic species hcn and hnc ) that can be formed in substantial amounts in subsurface ice layers rich in co , n@xmath0 , or nh@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ att - p1 ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "the scope and results of the simulation are broadly similar to those reported by @xcite .",
    "a major difference was that we consider bulk - ice chemical processes .",
    "it was found that _",
    "subsurface photoprocessing facilitates the synthesis of deuterium - poor species in bulk ice_. therefore , bulk ice chemistry does not help in explaining the very high observed @xmath1 ratios for some coms , contrary to a suggestion by @xcite .",
    "solid deuterium - rich organic species are confined to ice surfaces and those abundant in the bulk ice have lower d / h .    with the cloud core contracting , darkening , and cooling in the prestellar phase  1 , atomic d is largely lost to synthesis of the hd molecule on grain surfaces . in our model , this process coincides with a period of rapid ice accumulation . such competition for adsorbed d atoms results in that the majority of ice molecules are formed with relatively low @xmath1 .    the sequential evaporation of icy molecules in a warming protostellar envelope ( phase  2 ) affect the deuteration of many gaseous species .",
    "this happens either by the introduction of abundant deuteration agents in the gas ( e.g. , n@xmath0d@xmath6 ) or by providing abundant hydrogenated species ( e.g. , methane ) that are processed by selective deuteration reactions to temporarily achieve high @xmath1 level , which , in turn , is transferred to other species in reactions involving chemical radicals and ions .",
    "this results in species @xmath1 that is rapidly changing in the modeled temperature range of a protostellar envelope .",
    "the evolution of molecular @xmath1 with increasing temperature consists of a series of peaks.in the protostellar envelope , _ a combination of high gas - phase abundance and high d / h ratio is observed for species that are undergoing evaporation_. additionally , @xmath1 can be strongly affected by the evaporation of other species that take part in hydrogenation reaction chains ( sect.[rspec ] ) .",
