    "group iv clathrates with cages formed by ga , ge , sn and si atoms are particularly well studied examples .",
    "recent investigations of such intermetallic clathrates showed excellent thermoelectric properties@xcite .",
    "this is especially interesting for the group iv elements given their great potential in the modern semiconductor industry @xcite .",
    "research on the framework and caged atomic motions has also shown anomalous vibrational properties and their connection to the electronic behavior @xcite .",
    "understanding the guest atom vibration modes , often called `` rattling '' , has been considered to be one of the most important ways to reveal the essence of these phenomena .",
    "many methods including raman scattering @xcite , inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , optical conductivity @xcite , nmr relaxation @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite have been reported to analyze the rattling atoms in clathrates using different models .    during the last few years , ultra - low lattice thermal conductivity ( @xmath8 ) and glasslike thermal behavior have been discovered in particular in type - i ba@xmath2ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 @xcite . the rattling of guest atoms in the larger of its two structural cages has been confirmed to have close connection to those properties @xcite .",
    "anharmonic oscillators have also been used as trial models for the rattling phonons to analyze the thermoelectric properties and nmr relaxation behavior of other similar materials @xcite . in this paper",

    "simple one and two dimensional anharmonic potentials will be introduced to model the anharmonic local oscillators .",
    "the shape and energy levels of these potential wells will be obtained by matching the simulations to the nmr experimental results .",
    "the clathrate samples were prepared using the self - flux method , following a technique reported previously @xcite . because of the existence of a type - l / type - viii dimorphism in ba@xmath2ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 , a carefully controlled annealing process is needed during the sample making procedure . for type - i ba@xmath2ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 , the pure elements were mixed together based on the nominal composition followed by an initial arc melting in argon environment .",

    "no significant change in average shift vs temperature has been observed in the lineshape mapping .",
    "the small changes at the base of the lineshape vs. temperature are due to unreacted ga metal .",
    "the @xmath1ga lineshape is a superposition of two close peaks , which are due to different sites of the framework atoms @xcite .",
    "here we consider only the behavior at the center of the resonance , which is due to a superposition of different local configurations .",
    "the weighted center shift of this resonance is about 0.033% at 295 k. for comparison , the @xmath0ga lineshape under the same conditions , has a weighted shift of 0.023% .",
    "the shift includes magnetic and quadrupole terms , which can be expressed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 stands for the magnetic shift and @xmath21 is the quadrupole moment of the nucleus . from the observed field - dependence we extracted @xmath22 as the center - of - mass magnetic shift and a negative quadrupole shift . in this case",
    "@xmath20 is mainly a knight shift due to conduction electrons , with some contribution due to chemical shifts .",
    "note that we did not observe any significant change in @xmath20 , such as those observed in na - si type ii clathrates @xcite , indicating excitations involving sharp electronic features in the system .",
    "as reported previously we have also performed a structural analysis using @xmath23-@xmath24 calculations of the low - temperature nmr shifts for this sample , modeling in particular the first - order quadrupole broadening at the base of the lineshape according to the distribution of ga framework occupation .",
    "this agreed with the experimental lineshape quite well @xcite .",
    "nmr spin - lattice relaxation measurements were performed at the central transition frequency at the center of the lineshape .",
    "the relaxation time , @xmath25 , is a fitted value based on a magnetic relaxation mechanism using a standard multi - exponential function for recovery of the central transition @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole relaxation process entails a different relaxation function , which however leads only to an overall scaling of the @xmath25 , and does not affect any of the dynamical fitting parameters described below .",
    "the signal is also a superposition of different framework sites , however we fitted to a single average @xmath25 as parameter .",
    "1 shows the resulting rates for both @xmath1ga and @xmath0ga under a field of 8.8 t. a clear peak at a temperature around 10 k can be observed for both nuclei .",
    "the isotopic ratio , @xmath26 , under 8.8 t is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "2 . according to hyperfine relaxation theory @xcite , if the relaxation mechanism contains only a magnetic part , @xmath25 should be inversely proportional to @xmath27 which gives @xmath28 , while if the quadrupolar relaxation is in control , @xmath25 should be inversely proportional to @xmath29 which gives @xmath30 .",
    "the experimental ratio for our sample is consistent over a wide temperature range and is close to the quadrupole moment ratio .",
    "thus , the relaxation is mainly controlled by the quadrupole mechanism , indicating that lattice vibrations are the most important contribution .",
    "as our experimental data are a mixture of magnetic and quadrupole parts , it is necessary to separate them for further investigations .",
    "the corresponding relationships are @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath25 is the overall experimental relaxation time while @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the magnetic and quadrupole parts .",

    ", the result confirms the dominant role of the quadrupole relaxation rate .    at higher temperatures , as values of @xmath34",
    "do not change much , therefore the sample appears to follow a korringa - like relation @xcite , which would normally indicate the influence of metallic electrons if @xmath35 were magnetic .",
    "however a recent model @xcite for relaxation dominated by anharmonic localized vibrations indicates such behavior as a high - temperature limit , along with a low - temperature peak much as observed here .",
    "our later simulation based on this anharmonic model will be compared with the quadrupolar relaxation rates we have separated .     separated @xmath25 relaxation rates for @xmath1ga and @xmath0ga : @xmath0ga - quadrupole ( diamonds , as labeled ) , @xmath1ga - quadrupole ( circles , as labeled ) , @xmath1ga - magnetic ( squares ) , @xmath0ga - magnetic ( triangles ) .",

    "from refinements of x - ray diffraction spectra for ba@xmath2ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 , the guest ba(2 ) atom has location probability concentrated near four equivalent off - center positions with off - center dynamic displacements around 0.4 @xcite .",
    "our first principles calculations @xcite also gave similar values for the static displacement of the ba atom due to cage asymmetry .",
    "a 1-d double well potential was also introduced by dahm and ueda to analyze this kind of problem , and has shown good agreement for the pyrochlore case @xcite . to model our data , therefore we use the hamiltonian , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the mass , momentum and spatial coordinate of the guest atom ba @xcite .",

    ", we assume the real part of the phonon self energy , re@xmath57 , to be temperature independent as assumed in [ 17 ] . by carefully choosing parameters",

    ", this corresponds to a rms guest atom displacement of 0.17  , which is not far from the values reported previously @xcite . solving the schrdinger equation numerically , the energy levels of this double well potential can be calculated as shown in fig .",
    "the energy difference between the lowest two states , @xmath69 @xmath66 30 k , is much smaller than those for higher energy levels , which agrees with recent reported results from other methods @xcite , but with a larger @xmath69 .",

    "this model can also be extended to a simplified 2-d potential by using @xmath70 in equation ( 4 ) .",
    "we correspondingly modified the relationship in equation ( 5 ) .",
    "then , following the same procedure , we obtain a fitting similar to the 1-d model .",
    "the result is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3 , with the fitted values @xmath58 k , @xmath71 , @xmath60 k and @xmath61 k. the corresponding potential is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is in j with @xmath74 given in meters .",
    "the average displacement is still 0.17  , which indicates a consistency of the model compared with the 1-d case .",
    "compared to previous ga nmr results for sr@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 , also identified to behave as an anharmonic rattler system @xcite , it seems initially surprising that the @xmath75 in sr@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 does not show a similar phonon - dominated behavior but instead follows a korringa law quite closely for several decades of temperature @xcite . however , a previous report for sr - ge clathrates used density functional theory to extract potential well parameters for sr in the large cage @xcite , giving a 2d anharmonic potential much like the model used here .",
    "the resulting potential has a very small quadratic term , but also a much smaller anharmonicity parameter @xmath76 than found here , and inserting the calculated parameters into the relaxation theory described above yields a smaller quadrupole contribution to @xmath75 , rising slowly with temperature without exhibiting a peak as in fig .",
    "3 . also in the analysis reported for the elastic response of eu- and sr - filled ge clathrates @xcite a four - well potential was used to model the vibrational response for eu , but for sr a harmonic einstein oscillator model provided satisfactory agreement .",
    "thus it is consistent that the @xmath75 in sr@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 is dominated by interactions with the charge carriers , while the quadrupole - dominated peak observed in ba@xmath77ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 is indicative of the much larger anharmonicity for rattler atoms .    in our measurements",
    ", we prepared a second sample of type - i ba@xmath77ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 in the same way , whose @xmath78 exhibits a low - temperature maximum that is nearly identical to that of fig .",
    "1 . in fitting to the model oscillator potential",
    ", the position of the @xmath78 peak is particularly sensitive to @xmath79 , which is close to the spacing of the two lowest levels in fig .",
    "the ability to model this behavior with a single set of parameters attests to the lack of irregularity of the cage potential , despite the presence of quasi - random framework substitution .",
    "this is apparently due to the sn - based cage size , providing space for the relatively unconstrained motion of the ba(2 ) atoms without allowing for a permanent distortion @xcite .",
    "thus , type - i ba@xmath77ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 can be viewed as possessing a more or less uniform array of strongly anharmonic local oscillators .",
    "the nmr relaxation times are particularly sensitive to the low - frequency anharmonic motion of these atoms , and thus provide an excellent probe for this behavior .",
    "in conclusion , type - i ba@xmath77ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 nmr lineshapes and spin - lattice relaxation rates indicated the presence of a strong quadrupole relaxation mechanism .",
    "analysis showed this behavior to be due to a strongly anharmonic rattler - type motion of the caged ba atoms .",
    "fitting using a 1-d double well potential with strong anharmonicity showed good agreement with the experimental data , which offers a good explanation for the rattling behavior and the relaxation mechanism ."
