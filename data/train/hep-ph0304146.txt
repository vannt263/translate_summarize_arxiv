    "in spite of remarkable progress in study of @xmath6-violation phenomena in both k and b sectors it remains an interesting issue .",
    "the standard model  ( sm ) successfully describes existing experimental data by a single phase of the ckm matrix , although it is hard to believe that this phase is the only source of @xmath6-violation .",
    "for example , the baryon asymmetry of the universe can not be explained by the ckm phase only and at least one additional source of the @xmath6-violation is required .",
    "a good place to look for new @xmath6-violating phases is a measurement of processes where the sm @xmath6-violation is vanishing or very suppressed while additional or alternative sources of @xmath6-violation can produce a sizable effect .",
    "such interesting observables are the electric dipole moment of neutron which is extremely small in the sm , and the transverse lepton polarization in three - body decays of kaons and b - mesons  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the @xmath5-odd muon polarization in the decay @xmath7  ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "namely , we investigate the possibility to measure the vector and axial - vector kaon form factors , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , from the @xmath5-odd muon polarization emerging due to the electromagnetic final state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "also we analyze potential contributions to @xmath0 from various extensions of the sm . in this study",
    "we focus on the dalitz plot region where @xmath8 events have a large angle between photon and muon momenta .",
    "this is the region , where @xmath5-odd muon polarization exhibits the best sensitivity to @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , we found that in this region the ratio of the possible contribution to @xmath0 from new physics and fsi contribution to @xmath0 becomes the largest .",
    "hence , the analysis of the @xmath8 events at large @xmath9 will provide the best accuracy in measurement of the relevant parameters of the new physics or the strongest constraints on them .",
    "it is found that @xmath0 dependence on the kaon form factors gives a possibility to unambiguously determine in @xmath8 decay the signs of the sum of the kaon form factors without fixing their difference .",
    "combined with measurement of the normal muon polarization , which is very sensitive to @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite , this allows the values of the kaon form factors to be unambiguously extracted with 1% accuracy from this experiment .",
    "investigating the prospects of new experiments in searching for new physics we show that , generally , they are limited mostly by the uncertainty in fsi predictions rather than by the anticipated statistical error .",

    "due to lack of understanding of the qcd low - energy structure , there is no definite prediction for the values of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 form factors : the calculation of them is a model dependent procedure .",
    "so , the measurement of these form factors would give a possibility to make a choice between various candidates for the correct description of the qcd low - energy limit .",
