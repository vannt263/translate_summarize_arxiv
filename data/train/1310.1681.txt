    "the signature of the @xmath12-process contribution to the solar abundances implies two parts , a @xmath13 component , which is responsible for the mass region from y to bi , and a @xmath14 component , which dominates in the region between fe and sr .",
    "the main component can be assigned to low mass stars with @xmath15 , whereas the weak component is related to massive stars with @xmath16 ( @xmath17 stands for the mass of the sun ) . because of the much shorter evolution times of massive stars , the @xmath12-process enrichment of the universe starts with the lighter @xmath12 elements .",
    "accordingly , the weak @xmath12 process is important for the early stellar populations and for galactic chemical evolution in general @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 process in massive stars occurs in two steps during different evolutionary phases .",
    "neutrons are mainly produced by the @xmath18ne(@xmath19)@xmath20 mg reaction in both cases , but at rather different temperatures and neutron densities . during core he burning ,",
    "neutrons are produced near core he exhaustion at temperatures of @xmath21=(2.5 - 3.5)@xmath22 k for about 10@xmath23 years with neutron densities @xmath24 @xmath25 , whereas the higher temperatures of @xmath21=(1.0 - 1.4)@xmath26 k during the subsequent carbon shell burning phase give rise to peak neutron densities of about @xmath27 @xmath25 @xcite .    in the scenarios for the main and weak @xmath12 process ,",
    "the stellar ( @xmath28 ) cross sections of the involved isotopes constitute the essential nuclear physics input , but with an important difference : the high neutron exposure during the main component leads to equilibrium in the reaction flow , expressed by the so - called local approximation @xmath29 , which holds true for isotopes between magic neutron numbers .",
    "this relation implies that the emerging @xmath12 abundances are inversely proportional to the stellar cross sections and that the uncertainty of a particular cross section affects only the abundance of that specific isotope .",
    "in contrast , the neutron exposure in massive stars is too small to achieve flow equilibrium , and this means that cross section uncertainties are not only influencing the abundance of that particular isotope but have a potentially strong propagating effect on the abundances of the subsequent isotopes involved in the @xmath12-process chain .",
    "this propagation effect was first discussed for the @xmath30ni(@xmath31)@xmath32ni reaction @xcite and later investigated for the complete reaction chain of the weak @xmath12 process @xcite .",
    "computations with different choices for the maxwellian averaged cross sections ( macs ) showed important bottle - neck effects and the significant impact of crucial capture rates near the fe seed on the abundances of the subsequent isotopes in the reaction chain .",
    "limitations in the quality of stellar cross sections can , therefore , have serious consequences for the contributions of the weak @xmath12 process to galactic chemical evolution .",
    "stellar neutron capture cross sections in the mass region of the weak @xmath12 process are often not available with the required accuracy . in case of the zn isotopes ,",
    "experimental data suffer from large uncertainties or are even missing as for @xmath2zn @xcite .",
    "therefore , a series of activation measurements has been performed at the karlsruhe 3.7 mv van de graaff on natural zn to improve the accessible cross sections for @xmath33zn and for the partial cross section of @xmath1zn .",
    "because these isotopes have relatively small cross sections of less than about 50 mb , they are expected to give rise to large propagation effects in the final abundance distribution .    apart from its propagation effect in the weak @xmath12 process , zn is of general interest for galactic evolution . though it is commonly accepted that zn is produced by a variety of scenarios the respective nucleosynthesis mechanisms and their relative contributions",
    "are poorly understood .",
    "spectroscopic observations over a range of stellar metallicities ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) found indications of an overabundance of zn compared to fe in low - z stars , but an explanation for this excess appears premature in view of the present uncertainties concerning the origin of zn . in massive stars , the @xmath12 process component of the zn isotopes",
    "is obscured by the fact that measured neutron capture cross sections are scarce , uncertain or even missing .",

    "the proton beam with an energy of @xmath36=1912 kev , 30 kev above the reaction threshold , was delivered by the karlsruhe 3.7 mv van de graaff accelerator with typical intensities of 100 @xmath37a .",
    "the neutron production targets consisted of 30 @xmath37 m thick metallic li layers evaporated onto water cooled copper backings . in this way",
    ", neutrons are kinematically collimated into a forward cone of 120@xmath38 opening angle .",
    "neutron moderation is avoided since cooling is achieved by lateral heat conduction to the water flow outside of this cone . throughout the irradiations",
    "the neutron flux was continuously monitored and recorded in time steps of typically 60 s by means of a @xmath39li - glass detector at 1  m distance from the target .",
