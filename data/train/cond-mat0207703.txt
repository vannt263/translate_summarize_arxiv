    "in this paper we study topological defects which are induced by the confinement potential , i.e. which are a result of the finite size of the system .",
    "next we investigate how these defects influence the melting of the mesoscopic 2d island .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the model system and the numerical approach . sec .",
    "iii is devoted to the structural properties of the topological defects at zero temperature . in sec .",

    "the discussion on the non - homogeneous melting is presented in sec . v.",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the model system was defined in ref . @xcite and",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system is given by @xmath2 the confinement potential @xmath3 is taken circular symmetric and parabolic , where @xmath4 is the effective mass of the particles , @xmath5 is the particle charge , @xmath6 is the radial confinement frequency and @xmath7 is the dielectric constant of the medium the particles are moving in . to exhibit the scaling of the system , we introduce the characteristic scales in the problem : @xmath8 for the length , @xmath9 for the energy and @xmath10 for temperature . after the scaling transformations ( @xmath11 )",
    ", the hamiltonian can be rewritten in a simple dimensionless form as    @xmath12    which only depends on the number of particles @xmath13 .",
    "the numerical values for the parameters @xmath14for some typical experimental systems were given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the mc simulation technique @xcite is relatively simple and rapidly convergent and it provides a reliable estimation of the total energy of the system in cases when relatively small number of metropolis steps is sufficient .",
    "however , the accuracy of this method in calculating the explicit states is poor for systems with a large number of particles , which have significantly more metastable states . to circumvent this problem we employed the newton optimization technique which was outlined and compared with the standard monte carlo technique in ref .",
    "the structure and potential energy of the system at @xmath15 @xmath16 are found by the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite in which at some temperature the next simulation state of the system is obtained by a random displacement of one of the particles .",
    "we allow the system to approach its equilibrium state at some temperature @xmath15 , after executing @xmath17 `` mc steps '' .",
    "each mc step is formed by a random displacement of all particles . if the new configuration has a smaller energy it is accepted , but if the new energy is larger the configuration is accepted with probability @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a random number between 0 and 1 and @xmath20 is the increment in the energy @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the hexagonal lattice is the most energetically favored structure for classical point charges in a two - dimensional infinite plane at low temperature @xcite . for a system consisting of a finite number of repelling particles restricted to 2d , which are held together by a circular harmonic potential ,",
    "the cluster patterns are determined by the need to balance the tendency to form a triangular lattice against the formation of a compact circular shape .",
    "the configuration is determined by these two competing effects , namely circular symmetry and triangular structure ( wigner lattice ) .",
    "this competition leads to intrinsic defects in the 2d circular coulomb cluster which are _ geometry _ ( of the confinement potential ) _",
    "induced defects_. this ground state is not a defect free system .",
    "the symmetry breaking is due to the packing of the triangular lattice into a region with a circular boundary .",
    "a hexagonal lattice which is cut by a circle without the introduction of any defect has an energy @xmath21 which is larger than the ground state energy @xmath22 for @xmath23 particles .    in the first part of this paper",
    ", we investigate the form and position of the defects in large clusters .",
    "therefore we make use of the voronoi construction @xcite .",
    "the voronoi construction of a collection of particles consists of a partition of space into cells .",
    "each cell consists of those points which are closer to the given particular particle than to any other particles .",
    "examples of voronoi constructions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where the ground state configuration for @xmath24 and @xmath25 are shown .",
    "one can see that there are two kinds of defects , i.e. dislocations and disclinations .",
    "disclinations are orientational defects with five ( indicated by `  ' ) or seven ( indicated by ` + ' ) fold coordination number ( the number of sides of the polygon around the particles is nothing else then the coordination number ) . a dislocation is a pair of two disclinations consisting of a defect with 5-fold (  ) and a defect with 7-fold ( + ) coordination number . in the latter case",
    "the ordering at long distances is not disrupted and consequently such a bound pair has a much lower energy @xcite .",
    "the total number of 5-fold @xmath26 and 7-fold @xmath27 disclinations depends on the particular configuration .",
    "the number of disclinations in this system is determined by euler s theorem and ca nt be changed , so the net topological charge @xmath28 is always equal to six as was already demonstrated in refs .",
    "the reason is that every `  '",
    "defect can bend the lattice clockwise over @xmath29 from a straight lattice and thus six `  ' defects can bend a straight line into a circle .",
    "dislocations will appear when it decreases the energy of the system . from fig .",
    "1 it is apparent that this is more so for larger clusters .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the defects in clusters with a logarithmic inter - particle interaction were studied .",
    "we want to stress that their way of visualizing the defects is different : nearest neighbours are connected by a line , without making crossings .",
    "however , this does not lead to a unique picture : the total number of 5-fold , @xmath30 and 7-fold , @xmath31 disclinations can vary in the same configuration , only the net topological charge @xmath28 is always equal to six .    in these large clusters ,",
    "the defects are located on a hexagon , i.e. they form a hexagonal structure . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the defects are approximately situated at the six corners of a hexagon , each corner with a net topological charge of ` 1 ' .",
    "notice from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that a single 5-fold disclination can appear , but never a single 7-fold disclination . for the large strain energy around ` 1 ' topological charge , some dipole defects(i.e .",
    "dislocation with ` 1 ' and ` + 1 ' defects ) will be generated to shield the ` 1 ' topological charge .",
    "those shielding dipole defects do not change the topology of the system .",
    "a clearer example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the @xmath23 groundstate configuration .",
    "we considered the @xmath23 system as it minimizes the number of defects .",
    "the reason is that for this particle number the configuration has 42 particles in the outer ring , which is a multiple of the topological charge .",
    "there are three rings at the border with an equal number ( @xmath32 ) of particles ( the 1d wigner lattice ) , the central hexagonal structure ( the 2d wigner lattice ) and the defects indicated by triangles ( @xmath33 ) and squares ( @xmath34 ) are situated : ( i ) around the six corners of a hexagon and ( ii ) in the transition region between the outer rings and the central hexagon .",
    "it should be noted that the search for the global minimum configuration is a difficult problem for large systems because of the existence of a large number of local - minimum configurations , with energy very close to the global minimum .",
    "thus one is never @xmath35 sure to have found the real ground state .",
    "therefore , we investigated the different metastable states . in an experiment",
    ", those metastable states may be reached by thermal excitation if the energy barrier between them and the ground state is comparable to or smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "the saddle points between those metastable states were investigated in an earlier paper @xcite for @xmath37 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the energy and the total number of defects of different metastable states are shown for @xmath38 the results for the different metastable configurations are ordered with increasing energy . note from fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) that on average the total number of defects increases with energy , but it shows strong local variations . only an even number of defects are obtained , because the net topological charge is always six , and the dipole defects ( i.e. one dislocation with ` 1 ' and ` + 1 ' defects ) always appear in pairs .",
    "also the hexagonal position of the defects disappears ( see fig .  [ fig3](1 ) ) and more free dislocations are found .",
    "these defects move from the transition region to the border ( see fig .  [ fig3](2 ) ) or to the central region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](3 ) ) . for configurations with higher energy ,",
    "the defects arrange themselves in long chains , i.e. dislocation lines . on average",
    "the configurations with defects at the border have a lower energy than those with defects in the center .",
    "we also investigated whether or not it is possible to have a configuration with only six 5-fold disclinations and no other defects ( like for example for the @xmath39 configuration with 24 particles at the outermost ring @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we started our mc procedure with a perfect hexagonal structure without any defect and then allowed it to relax to its energy minimum .",
    "we did this for @xmath40 up to @xmath41 particles , because we noted that for these particle numbers the configuration has about 42 particles in the outer ring , which is a multiple of six , i.e. the net topological charge .",
    "only in such a case one can have the situation in which just six 5-fold disclinations are present .",
    "we found that our result ( from @xmath40 up to @xmath41 particles ) never converges to a configuration with only six 5-fold disclinations .",
    "however , this procedure indeed favorably relaxes to configurations with 42 particles in the outer ring , often resulting in a configuration which has less total number of defects than the corresponding groundstate .",
    "the effect of the geometry induced defects on the eigenfrequencies ( i.e. the eigenmode spectrum ) were also investigated for these large clusters . in this system",
    ", it is well known that there are three eigenfrequencies which are independent of @xmath13 @xcite : @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which correspond to the rotation of the system as a whole , the center of mass mode and the breathing mode , respectively .",
    "the above modes were recently observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the smallest frequency no longer correspond to intershell rotation as in small clusters @xcite but to the excitation of a vortex / antivortex pair , of which a typical mode is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "slightly larger excitation energies may consist of multiples of such pairs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) .",
    "modes with higher eigenfrequencies often show a hexagonal structure similar to the ordering of the defects .",
    "the motion can be concentrated around ( see fig .  [ fig4](c ) ) or between the defects ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) ) .",
    "the local modes can be found at the six corners of the hexagon where the defects are exactly situated ( see fig .  [",
    "fig4](e ) ) .",
    "the modes in which the inner particles have larger amplitudes than the outer particles have the largest eigenfrequencies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4](f ) ) .",
    "the lowest eigenfrequencies of the excitation spectrum corresponding to the ground - state configuration of the system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , as function of the number of particles for @xmath13 ranging from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "the labels in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] denote the total number of defects present in the ground state .",
    "notice that only an even number of defects are obtained as explained before . on average , configurations with a large number of defects",
    "have a smaller lowest eigenfrequency and are thus less stable , and vice versa .    in this 2d lattice , all behaviors of the cluster modes can be classified as shear - like or compression - like modes . in order to characterize the compressional and shear parts of these eigenmodes",
    ", we calculated respectively the divergence @xmath46 and the vorticity @xmath47 of the velocity field . to calculate the velocity field , we interpolated the displacements of fig . 4 on a @xmath48 grid ( thus neglecting the constant eigenfrequency ) .",
    "the `` divergence and vorticity maps '' were then calculated at every point of this matrix .",
    "notice that pure shear or compressional modes do not exist in the circular boundary of finite cluster .",
    "6(b ) shows the vorticity and thus displays the shear part of the eigenmode of fig .",
    "the two vortex / antivortex pairs are clearly seen .",
    "the `` divergence map '' for this eigenmode is practically zero everywhere , as there is no compressional part ( fig .",
    "this is not the case for the eigenmodes ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "6(c ) and ( e ) show the `` divergence maps '' for both eigenmodes , in which the compression and rarefaction can be clearly seen .",
    "both cases show no shear part ( figs .",
    "6(d ) and ( f ) ) . figs .",
    "6(c ) and 6(e ) ( see also the 3d plots at the bottom of fig .",
    "6 ) exhibit clearly dipole type of compressional oscillations between ( fig .",
    "6(c ) ) and at ( fig .",
    "6(e ) ) the defect regions .",
    "understanding the microscopic mechanism of melting has intrigued scientists since the late nineteenth century .",
    "special interest has been devoted to 2d melting @xcite .",
    "most works address infinite systems consisting of a single layer .",
    "however , whether melting of a 2d crystal is a first order transition and proceeds discontinuously or is a continuous transition in which the crystal first transits into a hexatic phase retaining quasi - long - range orientational order and then melts into an isotropic fluid , is still an open question and a controversial issue .    in the present work we consider a finite 2d system where we take @xmath23 for our numerical simulation . here",
    "we present a calculation of the melting phase diagram by performing mc simulations . in ref .",
    "@xcite molecular dynamics was used to investigate the melting of a cluster of particles interacting through a logarithmic interaction . as compared to our coulomb interaction where the geometry induced defects are situated in the 3@xmath49 and 4@xmath49 outer shells ( i.e. the transition region ) and around the six corners of the `` defect '' hexagon , in the logarithmic interacting system @xcite those defect are mainly situated in the outer two shells . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the number and type of defects were studied as function of the noise ( i.e. temperature ) . here",
    "we will use several different criteria such as the total energy , the radial dependent mean square displacement , the bond - angular order factor and the angular square deviation to characterize the melting behavior of the cluster .",
    "there are several different criteria that can be used to find the melting temperature . in order to determine the melting transition point , we calculated the potential energy of the system as a function of temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) . in the crystalline state the potential energy of",
    "the system increases almost linearly with temperature and then after the critical temperature is reached ( @xmath50 for @xmath23 ) , it increases more steeply as shown in fig .",
    "this is a signature of melting and is related to the unbinding of dislocation pairs . the dotted assurgent line in fig .",
    "7 indicates the linear temperature dependence of the potential energy for low temperatures before melting . in the upper inset fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , we plot @xmath20 which is the difference between the numerical obtained energy and the linear t - behavior . after the melting point , @xmath51 increases sup - linear .",
    "the lower inset , fig . [ fig7](b ) , shows the averaged number of defects as function of temperature @xmath52 .",
    "the number of defects were obtained as follows .",
    "we considered 40 configurations for every temperature @xmath52 .",
    "every 500 mc steps a new configuration was obtained .",
    "for all these configurations the number of defects were counted .",
    "finally we averaged over the 40 configurations , which is the reason why the number of defects can be non - integer .",
    "with increasing temperature , the system generates more and more defects and after the melting point the defect number grows very fast .",
    "notice that two clear critical temperatures emerge from this figure at the crossing points of the dotted lines , i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath53 .    in fig .",
    "8 we plot typical particle trajectories for different temperatures which shows that the melting of this system is very complex and non - homogeneous .",
    "it clearly indicates that the melting starts around the six corners of the hexagon which are exactly the defect regions . with increasing temperature ,",
    "the particles in the defect region start to move radially and destroy order locally . with further increase of temperature",
    "the total system completely melts and the order is destroyed .    in order to better describe the spatial dependence of the melting process in our system , we separate the configuration into three regions as shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "region i ( dark grey colored hexagonal area ) is comprised of the defect - free hexagonal center ; region ii is a transition region with the defects ( light grey colored area ) , and region iii consists of the outermost two rings . for the case of @xmath23 particles region",
    "i consists of @xmath54 particles , region ii  consists of @xmath55 particles and region iii  of @xmath56 particles .",
    "we calculate for each region the mean square displacement @xmath57 , which was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ,    @xmath58    with @xmath59 the average distance between the particles .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the @xmath60 as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath52 for the three different regions . at low temperatures the particles exhibit harmonic oscillations around their @xmath61 equilibrium position , and",
    "the oscillation amplitude increases linearly and slowly with temperature : the particles are well localized and display still an ordered structure .",
    "this linear dependence is accentuated by the thin straight lines in fig .",
    ", we already notice that the amplitude of the local particle thermal vibrations in these different regions are different .",
    "the amplitude is largest at the defect region and lowest in the center of the cluster .",
    "melting occurs when @xmath60 increases very sharply with @xmath15 . because of the finite number of particles one has rather a melting region , instead of a well - defined melting temperature . after the melting `` point '' ,",
    "the particles exhibit liquid - like behavior .",
    "[ fig9 ] exhibits three different melting temperatures corresponding to the three different regions .",
    "firstly region ii , i.e. the transition region containing the defects , starts to melt , then the outermost two rings melt , and finally the hexagonal region melts .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we can `` define '' a melting temperature at the point where @xmath62 which results into the melting temperatures @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the defect region , the outer rings and the center region , respectively .    in order to investigate the melting in the defect region in further detail we consider two new small regions as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "one region is around the defect , the other does nt contain a defect and is situated between two defect regions . for @xmath23",
    "each of the two regions contains respectively eight and seven  particles . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , the @xmath57 of these two different regions show a different melting temperature : the melting clearly starts first around the defect as expected .",
    "the particle motion is strongly influenced by the topological defects , i.e. the particles in the defect regions are less well interlocked and have a larger diffusion constant than the undistorted lattice regions and their thermal motions are easier to be excited @xcite .",
    "notice , that for the two separate regions a much sharper melting behavior is found than for the intermediate region as a whole ( see fig . [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the reason of course is that in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] one averages over defect and defect - free regions .",
    "the criterion @xmath65 results into @xmath66 for the defect and the defect - free regions , respectively .",
    "these two melting temperatures are very similar to the melting temperature of the transition region and the hexagonal region of fig .",
    "the third independent parameter is the bond - orientational correlation function .",
    "this quantity determines the type of melting transition and the melting point for an infinite system .",
    "our finite system is too small in order to have a reliable analysis of the asymptotic decay of the density correlation function .",
    "therefore , we calculate the bond - angular order factor which was originally presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , but following ref .",
    "@xcite we modified it into ,    @xmath67    this quantity is calculated only for region i which exhibits a hexagon structure , where @xmath68 means the @xmath69 nearest neighbors of particle @xmath70 , for ideal hexagonal lattice @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the angle between some fixed axis and the vector which connects the @xmath73 particle and its nearest @xmath74 neighbor .    for a perfect hexagonal system @xmath75 in our system for @xmath23 , the initial value of @xmath76 is 0.96 , which means that the structure in region i  is almost perfect hexagonal .",
    "our numerical results ( see open dots in fig . [ fig9 ] ) show that @xmath77 decreases linearly with increasing temperature .",
    "when @xmath76 is around @xmath78 , it more rapidly drops to zero with increasing temperature .",
    "@xmath76 should be zero for the liquid state .",
    "this can be compared with the infinite system where a universal melting criterion was found in ref .",
    "@xcite : melting occurs when the bond - angle correlation factor becomes @xmath79 @xmath80 , which was found to be independent of the functional form of the interparticle interaction . for our system",
    "the value @xmath79 @xmath80 is probably not correct because in our finite system @xmath76 does not drop to zero at @xmath81 , but is smeared out around @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the midpoint @xmath82 is expected to describe better the melting temperature .",
    "this leads to @xmath83 which is similar to the result @xmath84 obtained from the radial displacement criterion .",
    "in contrast to bulk systems , the melting scenario of small laterally confined 2d systems was found earlier @xcite to be a two step process . upon increasing the temperature ,",
    "first intershell rotation becomes possible where orientational order between adjacent shells is lost while retaining their internal order and the shell structure . at even higher temperatures",
    ", the growth of thermal fluctuations leads to radial diffusion between the shells , which finally destroys the positional order . to characterize the relative angular intrashell and the relative angular intershell",
    ", we use the functions as defined in ref .",
    "the relative angular intrashell square deviation    @xmath85 /\\varphi _ { 0}^{2},\\ ] ]    and the relative angular intershell square deviation    @xmath86 /\\varphi _ { 0}^{2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath87 indicates the nearest particle from the same shell , while @xmath88 refers to the nearest - neighbor shell , @xmath89 where the number in the outermost two rings @xmath90is the same and equals 42 for our @xmath23 system . only the two outermost rings have a clear shell structure .",
    "both two outer rings are strongly interlocked which is a consequence of the 1d wigner lattice arrangement of the two rings . from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , one can see that the inner ring will melt before the outermost ring .",
    "we find that the result for @xmath91 of the inner ring is almost the same as @xmath92 which is the relative angular intershell square deviation .",
    "it means that when the inner ring loses its order , the relative order is lost simultaneously .",
    "the outermost ring can still keep its order and it will melt at even higher temperature . comparing this with fig .",
    "9 , we see that the radial and angular displacements start to increase rapidly at approximately the same temperature .",
    "thus for large clusters intershell rotation will not occur below the melting temperature , but appears at the same temperature when the radial displacements increase .",
    "the configurational and melting properties of large two - dimensional clusters of charged classical particles interacting with each other via the coulomb potential were investigated through the monte carlo simulation technique . for the ground state configuration ,",
    "a hexagonal wigner lattice is formed in the central area while at the border of the cluster the particles are arranged in rings . in the transition region between them",
    "defects appear as groups of dislocations and disclinations at the six corners of the hexagonal - shaped inner domain .",
    "many different arrangements and types of defects are possible as metastable configurations with a slightly higher energy . the particles motion is found to be strongly related to the local topological structure .",
    "our results clearly show that the melting of the clusters starts near the geometry induced defects , and that three melting temperatures can be obtained : @xmath63 and @xmath93 for the defect region , the outer rings and the center region , respectively .",
    "these values are for the @xmath23 cluster . taking a different value for @xmath13 does not lead to any qualitative differences",
