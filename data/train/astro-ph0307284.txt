    "continuing disagreement as to whether massive compact halo objects ( machos ) have been detected by microlensing experiments looking towards the magellanic clouds highlights the need for other microlensing targets ( e.g. , kerins 2001 ) . the andromeda galaxy ( m31 )",
    "presents an opportune target in this respect .",
    "the disk of m31 is highly inclined ( @xmath2 ) , with the consequence that lines of sight to disk stars in the north - west or near side of m31 are shorter than those to the south - east or far side . microlensing by a spheroidal dark halo will have a characteristic signature with an excess of events on the far side of the m31 disk ( crotts 1992 ; baillon et al.1993 ) .",
    "this asymmetric signal is absent for variable stars or stellar microlenses in the disk of m31 . a number of groups ( e.g. , aurire et al .",
    "2001 ; riffeser et al .  2001 ; calchi - novati et al .  2002 ; crotts et al .",
    "2001 ) are now carrying out large - scale surveys of m31 to search for this near - far disk asymmetry .",
    "this is a mammoth task as the individual stars in m31 are not resolved , so that new techniques based on the super - pixel method ( ansari et al .",
    "1997 ) or difference imaging ( e.g. , crotts & tomaney 1996 ) have been exploited to measure the flux changes on unresolved stars . nonetheless , convincing candidate events are now being discovered , for example by the point - agape collaboration ( e.g. , aurire et al .  2001",
    "; paulin - henriksson et al .  2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , this is a timely moment to consider what factors affect the near - far disk asymmetry and how many events are likely to be needed for a convincing detection .    the aim of this paper is to estimate the size of candidate event samples needed to detect asymmetry for different halo models . in sections 2 and 3 of the paper",
    "we show how the magnitude of the asymmetry signal is affected by the velocity anisotropy and the flattening of the m31 baryonic dark halo respectively .",
    "there are few ways known to us for measuring the properties of the orbits of dark objects in the halo of any galaxy or for ascertaining the flattening of the baryonic dark component of the halo .",
    "hence , any clues gleaned from pixel lensing experiments will be invaluable . in section 4",
    ", we present some simple , non - parametric statistical estimators of asymmetry and calculate how many candidates are needed to give convincing detections .",
    "here , we investigate the microlensing properties of haloes in which the velocity distribution of the machos is anisotropic .",
    "we use models in which the halo density @xmath3 is isothermal and the rotation curve is flat : @xmath4 for these models , the velocity dispersions in the spherical polar coordinate system are given by ( see e.g. , white 1981 ; evans , hfner & de zeeuw 1997 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "if @xmath7 , then the velocity distribution is referred to as ` radially anisotropic ' ; if @xmath8 , then it is ` tangentially anisotropic . '",
    "whilst @xmath9 in equation  ( [ vel ] ) diverges as @xmath10 , velocity dispersion ratios are rarely observed to be more extreme than 3:1 , implying @xmath11 .",
    "we assume a circular velocity of @xmath12 for m31 s halo ( emerson 1976 ) and we compute the cutoff radius to give a total halo mass of @xmath13 ( e.g. , evans & wilkinson 2000 ) .",
    "the sources are drawn from the m31 disk which is adequately modelled as a sheet inclined at 77  to the line of sight .",
    "the source velocity is assumed to be dominated by the disk rotation speed of 235  @xmath14 .    for each halo model",
    ", we calculate a theoretical estimate of the pixel - lensing rate @xmath15 . unlike the classical ( resolved star ) microlensing rate",
    ", @xmath15 depends additionally on the surface brightness of the m31 disk and the luminosity function of the m31 sources ( c.f . , kerins et al .",
    "the calculations here are performed for a @xmath16-band luminosity function and surface brightness distribution .",
    "the surface brightness of m31 is tabulated in walterbos & kennicutt ( 1987 ) .",
    "the m31 disk luminosity function is assumed to be the same as for the milky way and we use the data of wielen , jahrei & kruger ( 1983 ) to characterise the faint end ( @xmath17 ) and that of bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) for the bright end .",
    "for each source star of flux @xmath18 at sky position ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) on the m31 disk , we compute the maximum impact parameter , @xmath21 , needed to ensure that the magnified source star noticeably enhances the local flux contribution from the background galaxy and sky background . motivated by the point - agape experiment ( e.g. , paulin - henriksson et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) , we assume that detection is performed on a `` super - pixel '' array of pixels of size @xmath22 which typically encloses 40% of the total flux from a point source .",
    "in addition to the background due to the m31 surface brightness we allow for a sky background of 19.5  @xmath23 .",
    "we assume an event is detectable if the flux change caused by microlensing is @xmath24 of the background flux on the super - pixel .",
    "the pixel lensing rate is then @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the classical microlensing rate ( paczyski 1986 ; kiraga & paczyski 1994 ) and @xmath27 is the maximum impact parameter averaged over the luminosity function @xmath28 of the source stars .",
    "explicitly , we can write that @xmath29 this is an upper limit to the observed pixel lensing rate for any real experiment , as it does not take into account the effects of sampling , changing observing conditions or event identification algorithms .",
    "these effects may alter the spatial distribution of events , but they can be corrected via the calculated detection efficiency .",
    "in fact , the efficiency is largely controlled by the local surface brightness and so is approximately symmetric with respect to the major axis .",
    "the ratio of the number of far - disk to near - disk events therefore does not depend on the efficiency to lowest order .    finally , the spatially - averaged pixel - lensing rate @xmath30 is obtained by weighting the rate with the m31 disk surface brightness .",
    "the central portions of the m31 disk are omitted , partly because stellar lenses in the m31 bulge dominate here and partly because the halo model is singular at the centre .",
    "so , a central region of 5  radius is excised from the m31 disk before performing the spatial averaging separately for events above and below the m31 major axis .",
    "none of the current experiments is surveying the entire m31 disk , but their fields do span the large majority of the minor axis and we therefore expect any underlying asymmetry in their fields to be representative of the globally - averaged asymmetry computed here .",
    "figure  [ fig : pix ] shows the spatially - averaged theoretical pixel - lensing rate , @xmath30 , for lenses of mass @xmath31 , normalised to the value @xmath32 events per star per year . when @xmath7 , the velocity distribution is radially anisotropic and the rate @xmath33 . when @xmath34 , the velocity distribution is tangentially anisotropic and the rate @xmath35 , so the total rate in radially anisotropic models is somewhat higher . however , we are primarily interested in the differences between the near and far disk .",
    "such asymmetries may manifest themselves in the numbers , locations and time - scales of the events .",
    "accordingly , figure  [ fig : pix ] also shows the far - to - near disk ratios for the pixel - lensing rates ( @xmath36 ) , the mean einstein crossing times ( @xmath37 ) and the ratio of mean projected distances of events to the major axis ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "all models show a strong excess of far - disk events , with @xmath39 increasing from 5.3 to 7 as the models go from tangential to radial anisotropy .",
    "it is also evident from @xmath38 in figure  [ fig : pix ] that far - disk events lie systematically farther from the major axis than near - disk events , providing a second signature of asymmetry .",
    "however @xmath38 is nearly constant across the range of @xmath40 so this spatial signature does not provide a probe of the degree of velocity anisotropy .",
    "there is also an asymmetry in the einstein crossing times of m31 machos .",
    "if machos have radially distended orbits , then their motion tends towards being parallel to the line of sight for the near disk but orthogonal to it for the far disk .",
    "events on the near side therefore last longer . in other words ,",
    "the ratio of the typical time - scales of far - disk to near - disk events decreases with increasing radial anisotropy .",
    "consequently , the ratio of the numbers of events in the far - disk to the near - disk is enhanced in radially anisotropic models compared to isotropic model .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the spatially - averaged microlensing optical depth , @xmath41 , is independent of the velocity distribution . from figure",
    "[ fig : pix ] , the expected enhancement in the number asymmetry @xmath39 is @xmath130% .    for the isotropic model ( @xmath42 ) ,",
    "the time - scales are typically shorter in the far disk than in the near disk .",
    "the reason for this is that the typical separation between lens and source is larger for near - disk machos . for far - disk events ,",
    "the typical lens - source separation is biased towards the location where the density peaks along the line of sight , which is at a distance @xmath43 in front of the sources , where @xmath20 is the projected distance along the minor axis .",
    "the situation is different for near - disk machos , where the line of sight density is always a monotonically decreasing function of lens - source separation . here , the typical separation is @xmath12030  kpc for @xmath44 , so @xmath37 is less than unity for an isotropic model , as shown in figure  [ fig : pix ] .",
    "unfortunately , the einstein crossing time is not generally measurable for pixel - lensing events .",
    "instead experiments measure the full - width half - maximum ( @xmath45 ) of the lightcurve , which is additionally correlated with the source luminosity and background surface brightness distribution .",
    "the resulting @xmath45 distributions are therefore predicted to be broad and any asymmetries in the time - scale distribution are unlikely to be easily observable .",
    "self - consistent solutions of the self - gravitation equations for the density , potential and velocity distributions of flattened halo models are rare . even solving the jeans equations for the second velocity moments can lead to cumbersome results .",
    "baltz , gyuk & crotts ( 2003 ) have computed pixel - lensing rates explicitly for simple analytic flattened halo models . however",
    ", if we are merely interested in comparing the effects of flattening on the ratios of quantities in the near- and far - disk , then there is a quick alternative to carrying out computations with a fully axisymmetric halo model .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic ] shows lines of sight passing through an elliptical halo with axis ratio @xmath46 and eccentricity @xmath47 .",
    "the lines strike the disk of m31 at an angle @xmath48 .",
    "the ratios of the optical depths in the near and far disk are proportional to the line segments np and fp . also shown is an equivalent spherical halo . by extending n vertically to n and f to f , we can construct lines of sight that pass through the spherical halo and strike the disk at a different angle @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , the ratios of the optical depths are proportional to the line segments np and fp . from the elementary properties of the ellipse",
    ", it follows that the two ratios are the same ( np / fp = np / fp ) . by straightforward trigonometry",
    ", one has @xmath50 . in other words , the asymmetry signal of a flattened halo with axis",
    "ratio @xmath46 is the same as that of an equivalent spherical halo , provided the disk is viewed not at angle @xmath48 but at an angle @xmath49 .",
    "this transformation takes into account the geometric effects of flattening .",
    "the first - order changes in the velocity distribution can be computed using the tensor virial theorem ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; han & gould 1995 ) .",
    "strictly speaking , the tensor virial theorem applies globally and relates the components of the total kinetic energy tensor @xmath51 to the components of the total potential energy tensor @xmath52 .",
    "if we assume that the virial theorem holds at each spot , then it follows that @xmath53 here , we have assumed that the figure is oblate spheroidal , with the the short axis being in the @xmath54 direction and the @xmath55 plane being equatorial .",
    "although this is only an approximate relation , valid for small flattening , it shows that the first - order changes in the velocity distribution are also accounted for by the transformation .",
    "this means that a quick way to study the asymmetry properties of flattened haloes is to take isotropic spherical models and vary the inclination angle of the m31 disk .",
    "we stress that the transformation does not allow us to calculate absolute quantities like the rate , but only the ratios of such quantities in the near and far disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : flatpix ] shows the variation in the far - to - near - disk ratios for the pixel lensing rates @xmath39 , the means of vertical distances @xmath38 and the time - scales .",
    "the asymmetry signal @xmath39 for a halo with flattening @xmath46 is linearly related to the asymmetry signal for a spherical halo @xmath56 , that is @xmath57 the asymmetry signal clearly diminishes with flattening ; it is obvious that , in the completely flat limit where the halo becomes a razor - thin disk , the asymmetry must vanish .",
    "the change in @xmath39 with flattening is almost entirely caused by the change in the ratio of optical depths .",
    "therefore the ratio of the average time - scales is largely unaffected by flattening .",
    "the distance asymmetry @xmath38 also decreases with increasing flattening , as is again obvious in the razor - thin limit .",
    "the distance asymmetry arises in a spherical model because of two effects .",
    "first , lines of sight are longer as we move from near to far disk .",
    "second , the line of sight with greatest column density goes through the centre in the near - disk but lies away from the centre in the far - disk .",
    "so the distribution of distances of events is monotonically decreasing in the near disk , but rises to a maximum and then decreases in the far disk . as the flattening increases , all lines of sights become shorter and the density becomes more concentrated towards the centre .",
    "the distributions of distances in both the near and far disk shrink and the maximum moves towards the centre in the far disk .",
    "this latter effect is the dominant one , and so the distance asymmetry signals falls with increasing flattening .",
    "in this section , we ask whether one can detect the asymmetry signals in the presence of contaminating events and how the velocity anisotropy and the halo flattening affect this detectability .",
    "that is , we ask how many candidates are needed to detect the asymmetry at a certain confidence level .",
    "first , we consider the number asymmetry @xmath39 between the far and near side .",
    "one problem is that none of the experiments will be able to obtain pure samples of m31 macho events ; some microlensing contamination from milky way machos and m31 stars , as well as non - microlensing contamination from variable stars and supernovae in background galaxies will be inevitable .",
    "contamination by periodic variables can be minimized by observing over a sufficiently long time .",
    "colour information can also be used to eliminate variable stars .",
    "fortunately , the other contaminants are equally likely to occur in the near and far regions of the m31 disk . whether or not an asymmetry can be detected is therefore a question of the size of the sample , the magnitude of the underlying m31 macho asymmetry and the level of contamination .",
    "let us denote the numbers of m31 macho events in the near and far disk by @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively , and the number of contaminants by @xmath60 .",
    "the condition for a detection of the asymmetry signal at the @xmath61-@xmath62 level is that the difference between the far and the near counts be greater than @xmath61 times the poisson error , which is given by the square root of the total number of the events .",
    "therefore @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the total number of candidates on the far and near sides , respectively , including contaminant events . in the case where the contaminants are distributed evenly between the far and near disk , @xmath66 .",
    "straightforward manipulation of the above condition leads to a condition on the total number of candidate events , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the underlying asymmetry of the m31 macho events , @xmath69 is the contamination factor , and @xmath70 the total number of candidate events . figure  [ fig : crit ] shows the expected number of events ( including the contaminants ) required to detect an asymmetry at the 99% confidence level ( @xmath71 ) for various contamination factors .",
    "we see immediately that the size of the asymmetry signal is crucial . if @xmath72 , then even with low contamination the number of m31 microlensing events needed to give a convincing detection of asymmetry exceeds @xmath73 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the asymmetry is @xmath15 , then more than 15 candidates are required .",
    "reassuringly , on referring to figures  [ fig : pix ] and [ fig : flatpix ] , we see that @xmath39 typically lies between 5 and 7 for spherical models , and only becomes as small as 2 for models with @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , haloes flatter than this are not likely on dynamical grounds , as they are susceptible to bending instabilities ( e.g. , merritt & sellwood 1994 ) . samples of @xmath115 candidate events are well within reach of the current surveys if machos contribute significantly to the dark matter budget .",
    "however , this number is only the contribution of the m31 halo , as we have cut out the central parts of the m31 disk .",
    "if the contribution of machos to the dark matter mass budget is significant in m31 , we expect a similar macho contribution for the milky way . for interesting macho fractions , the foreground milky way machos may well provide the dominant contribution to @xmath74 .",
    "if the typical macho mass and halo density contributions are universal , then the magnitude of @xmath74 will be determined , to first order , by the relative masses of the m31 and milky way haloes . if the m31 halo is twice as massive as the milky way s , then @xmath75 ( kerins et al .  2001 ) , whilst we should expect @xmath74 to be closer to unity if the two haloes are equally massive ( evans & wilkinson 2000 ) . in any case",
    ", the total number of candidates required to confirm asymmetry scales as @xmath76 from equation  ( [ asymm ] ) , so we require four times as many candidates to detect the asymmetry when @xmath77 as when @xmath78 .      motivated by the variation in mean distances of events between the near and far disk seen in figures  [ fig : pix ] and [ fig : flatpix ]",
    ", we can go beyond the asymmetry in number counts by considering a distance asymmetry signature .    to quantify differences between the near - disk and far - disk event positions , we apply the mann - whitney rank - sum test ( mann & whitney 1947 ) .",
    "this is a non - parametric test for differences between the medians of two samples .",
    "the mann - whitney test exploits the fact that two samples drawn from identical distributions exhibit the property that , if one combines them and then ranks the elements by size , the two samples are uniformly intermingled on average within the ranked combined sample . for two samples of large enough size @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the sum of the rank numbers for sample @xmath81",
    "is normally distributed about a mean @xmath82 with a variance @xmath83 .",
    "the null hypothesis of similarity ( or , in our case , symmetry ) is therefore straightforward to quantify .    in the case of m31 pixel lensing",
    ", we can apply the mann - whitney test to the distribution of @xmath20 , the projected distance from the m31 major axis , for candidates in the near- and far - disk sub - samples .",
    "we can also combine the mann - whitney test with the number asymmetry test , since the mann - whitney statistic probes the spatial distribution of events , not the relative sizes of the samples .",
    "if the far - disk event positions are designated as sample @xmath81 and the sum of their rank numbers within the combined near- and far - disk sample is @xmath84 , then we can define @xmath85 . taking @xmath86 to be the significance of the number asymmetry statistic ,",
    "as defined by the left - hand side of equation  ( [ asymm_c ] ) , then the overall significance of the combined sample is @xmath87 .",
    "a value of @xmath88 would indicate a near - far asymmetry favoured at the 99% confidence level .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations to determine the number of candidates required to secure a 99% confidence detection of asymmetry .",
    "the simulations test a range of anisotropic and flattened halo models and a range of contaminations . for a given model , event position realisations",
    "are generated using the theoretical pixel - lensing rate of equation  ( [ prate ] ) , weighted by source number density .",
    "for each new event realisation , the overall significance , @xmath61 , of the cumulative sample is computed from both the mann - whitney statistic ( @xmath89 ) and the number asymmetry statistic ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "when there are fewer than five events in either the far- or near - disk sub - samples , only the number asymmetry statistic is used because the distribution of rank sums for small data - sets can deviate strongly from gaussianity .",
    "we assume the contaminating populations are symmetrically distributed about the m31 major axis , though we adopt the most difficult case when they have a comparable spatial dispersion to the m31 macho events . the extent to which this is true depends upon whether milky way machos , on the one hand , or variable stars and stellar microlenses , on the other hand , provide the dominant contribution to @xmath60 .",
    "if the latter population dominates , then contaminants are likely to be more spatially concentrated than m31 machos , making the macho asymmetry easier to measure for a given @xmath74 .",
    "so for each pixel - lensing realisation , a uniform random number in the interval [ 0,1 ] is chosen .",
    "if it is less than @xmath90 $ ] , then the position of the event is flipped about the m31 major axis .",
    "this means that , on average , a fraction @xmath91 of the total sample is symmetrically distributed , as required . a full trial , @xmath48 ,",
    "is terminated either when the cumulative sample of @xmath92 candidates provides at least a 99% confidence detection of asymmetry , or when the program estimates that the required sample is likely to exceed 500 events .",
    "this whole process is repeated 1000 times for each model and the median value of @xmath93 ( excluding trials which are prematurely terminated ) is adopted as the estimate for @xmath94 .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : monte ] shows the median number of candidate events ( including the contaminants ) required to detect an asymmetry with 99% confidence , as a function of the halo velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath40 . in the absence of contamination ,",
    "a sample size between 11 to 14 events is typically sufficient to detect asymmetry .",
    "the raggedness of this line is partly due to monte carlo noise but also partly due to the fact that @xmath94 necessarily takes only a few discrete values in the limit of small data - sets . from equation  ( [ asymm_c ] ) , the smallest sample needed give rise to a 99% confidence detection of asymmetry is 7 events , all of which must be located in the far disk ( assuming the asymmetry is caused by m31 machos ) .",
    "when one candidate lies in the near disk we need @xmath95 , and when two candidates lie in the near disk we require @xmath96 .",
    "the leaps in the thick solid line between 11 and 14 events reflect this discrete behaviour , though the oscillation back and forth for @xmath97 is due to monte - carlo noise . in the worst case considered in figure  [ fig : monte ] , where contaminants outnumber m31 machos by 3:1",
    ", a median sample of @xmath1120 events is required to detect asymmetry . for @xmath42 and @xmath98 , we find that the expectation value of @xmath94 is around 190 .",
    "using @xmath88 , @xmath98 and an asymmetry @xmath99 when @xmath42 ( figure  [ fig : pix ] ) , equation  ( [ asymm ] ) indicates that we should require @xmath100 if we use number - count information alone .",
    "therefore the addition of distance information allows around a 15% reduction in the required number of candidates in this case .",
    "overall , @xmath94 does not appear to be particularly sensitive to @xmath40 .",
    "this is to be expected when contamination levels are high because the 30% contrast in @xmath39 between the radially- and circularly - anisotropic models ( see figure  [ fig : pix ] ) is strongly diluted .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : monte ] shows the situation for flattened halo models .",
    "the larger range in @xmath39 for the flattened models ( @xmath101 ) means that the median @xmath94 shows a greater sensitivity to flattening than to velocity anisotropy . in the absence of contaminants",
    ", @xmath102 is typically needed to confirm asymmetry for models rounder than @xmath0 .",
    "a sample of 100 candidates would permit asymmetry to be detected even if @xmath103 .",
    "adding distance information is particularly effective at reducing the required size of candidate samples for highly flattened models .",
    "as an extreme example , when @xmath104 and @xmath78 , the expectation of @xmath94 is around 80 if distance information is used along with number counts . from equation  ( [ asymm ] ) , 750 candidates are required if only number counts are used .",
    "this shows the value of the mann - whitney statistic .",
    "it is of course much more difficult to measure an asymmetry than to detect one .",
    "suppose an experiment has gathered @xmath105 events ( including contaminants ) . with reference to figure  [ fig : crit ] ,",
    "if there has been no detection of asymmetry at the 99% confidence level , then  as @xmath106 for all models we have considered with @xmath107  we can infer that the signal has been overwhelmed by contaminants ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the degree of contamination must be greater than a critical value which is given by computing the curve which passes through the point ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "so , a null signal can be used to give a constraint on the contamination . on the other hand , if there has been a detection , then the measured signal @xmath110 is merely a lower limit to the true signal .",
    "it should be possible to estimate the contamination fraction statistically even if we do not know the individual contaminating events , so the true asymmetry signal can be matched to models using standard bayesian likelihood methods ( kerins et al 2001 ) .",
    "current surveys should therefore be able to discriminate between halo models with different degrees of flattening and may , if the spatial distribution of contaminant populations is well characterized , be able to distinguish between radially - anisotropic halo models and tangentially - anisotropic or isotropic models .      additional confusion of the asymmetry signal may come from microlensing by stars which belong to streams or tidal debris from disrupted satellite galaxies cannibalized by m31 and/or by stars belonging to the intervening dwarf elliptical m32 .",
    "ibata et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have traced out a giant stream in the m31 stellar halo in red giant branch star counts .",
    "the stream is @xmath11  wide in projection .",
    "it seemingly originates from the satellite galaxy m32 and possibly also incorporates ngc  205 .",
    "the average surface brightness of the stream is @xmath130  @xmath23 in the @xmath16-band .",
    "it has been suggested by ferguson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that this may confuse the detection of the near - far disk asymmetry in the microlensing experiments . for sources in m31 and lensing populations at roughly the same distance from the sources ,",
    "the optical depth of the stream is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the surface brightness in magnitude per arcsec@xmath113 , @xmath114 the separation of the stream from m31 disk along the line of sight and m / l is the macho mass - to- light ratio of the stream .",
    "this ratio must exceed 100 for the optical depth of the stream to be comparable to the other lensing populations .",
    "accordingly , the presence of such streams is not likely to be problematic for asymmetry detection .",
    "more problematic may be the intervening dwarf elliptical galaxy m32 .",
    "the point - agape collaboration has already found a candidate which lies @xmath13  in projection away from the centre of m32 and argued that the lens most probably lies in m32 itself ( paulin - henrikkson et al .",
    "the optical depth of m32 is estimated to be ( paulin - henrikkson et al .",
    "2003 ) @xmath115 where @xmath114 is the separation of m32 from m31 along the line of sight and @xmath116 is the stellar mass - to - light ratio of m32 .",
    "this is comparable to the signal expected from the baryonic halo ( assuming a 20% macho fraction ) .",
    "although microlensing associated with m32 is a potentially significant contaminent the affected region can be readily excluded from the statistics using an appropriate mask .",
    "pixel - lensing experiments targeting m31 are hoping to exploit the favourably high disk inclination in order to detect an asymmetry in the spatial distribution of microlensing events .",
    "if such a signal is found , it will provide powerful evidence for the existence of machos .    for a spherically symmetric and isotropic halo ,",
    "the numbers of m31 machos in the far - disk outnumber those in the near - disk by more than 5 to 1 .",
    "this asymmetry is increased by about 30% if m31 machos occupy radial orbits rather than tangential ones .",
    "the signal is diminished if m31 machos lie in a flattened halo . however , even for haloes as flat as @xmath0 , the numbers of m31 machos in the far side will outnumber those in the near side by a factor of @xmath12 .",

    "<S> the point - agape collaboration is currently searching for massive compact halo objects ( machos ) towards the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) . the survey aims to exploit the high inclination of the m31 disk , which causes an asymmetry in the spatial distribution of m31 machos . here </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the effects of halo velocity anisotropy and flattening on the asymmetry signal using simple halo models . for a spherically symmetric and isotropic halo , we find that the underlying pixel - lensing rate in far - disk m31 machos is more than 5 times the rate of near - disk events . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the asymmetry is increased further by about 30% if the machos occupy radial orbits rather than tangential orbits , but is substantially reduced if the machos lie in a flattened halo . </S>",
    "<S> however , even for haloes with a minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath0 , the numbers of m31 machos in the far - side outnumber those in the near - side by a factor of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a distance asymmetry , in that the events on the far - side are typically further from the major axis . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , if this positional information is exploited in addition to number counts , then the number of candidate events required to confirm asymmetry for a range of flattened and anisotropic halo models is achievable , even with significant contamination by variable stars and foreground microlensing events . for pixel - lensing surveys which probe a representative portion of the m31 disk , </S>",
    "<S> a sample of around 50 candidates is likely to be sufficient to detect asymmetry within spherical haloes , even if half the sample is contaminated , or to detect asymmetry in haloes as flat as @xmath0 provided less than a third of the sample comprises contaminants . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue that , provided its mass - to - light ratio is less than 100 , the recently observed stellar stream around m31 is not problematic for the detection of asymmetry . </S>"
