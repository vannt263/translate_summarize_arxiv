    "recent advances in fabrication techniques involving molecular beam epitaxy and lithography have now made it possible to make narrow gaas - based quasi - one dimensional ( 1d ) electronic systems with lateral dimensions of the order of the bohr radius @xcite . in these so - called quantum wire structures , the motion of charge carriers is confined in two transverse directions but is essentially free ( in the effective mass sense ) in the longitudinal direction .",
    "study of collective modes in reduced dimensional electron systems in semiconductor nanostructures is a subject of growing experimental and theoretical interest .",
    "experimentally , far - infrared optical spectroscopy@xcite and resonant inelastic light scattering spectroscopy@xcite have been used to study quasi-1d elementary electronic excitations .",
    "several theoretical studies , mostly based on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , have been reported on the energy dispersion of elementary excitations in semiconductor quantum wires .",
    "the measured 1d intrasubband plasmon dispersion agrees remarkably well with the rpa predictions @xcite .",
    "the quantitative agreement between rpa predictions and the experimental results @xcite was later explained by the fact @xcite that the calculated rpa plasmon dispersion and the tomonaga - lutinger theory for the collective charge density excitations of the 1d electron system are equivalent at long wavelengths by virtue of the vanishing of vertex corrections @xcite in the irreducible polarizability of the 1d electron gas .",
    "the two - component quasi-1d systems which are composed of electrons and holes have been generated in a wide variety of semiconductor quantum wires by optical pumping .",
    "spatially separated two - component quasi-1d systems can be produced by additional lateral confinement to produce a double quantum wire structure in gaas ",
    "ga@xmath4al@xmath5as double quantum well systems .",
    "the collective modes of the two - component plasma also play important roles in the many - body physics of carriers such as screening of the coulomb interaction potential and in coulomb drag problem . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the dispersion and the spectral weight of longitudinal collective modes ( with and without spatial separation ) in quasi-1d two - component plasmas as in semiconductor double quantum wire structures or in photoexcited homogeneous 1d electron - hole plasmas ( ehp ) .",
    "our theory is based mostly on the two - component rpa ( which should be well - valid in 1d systems ) ; in the 1d ehp case we go beyond rpa to include local field corrections to assess the validity of 1d rpa .",
    "the collective modes of the two - component plasma have been widely studied in higher dimension @xcite , and recently , numerically in quasi-1d ehp @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that a two - component plasma has two branches of longitudinal collective excitation spectra called the optical plasmon ( op ) and the acoustic plasmon ( ap ) , where the density fluctuations in each component oscillate in - phase ( op ) and out - of - phase ( ap ) respectively relative to each other , assuming the two charge components to be the same .",
    "as expected , we find two plasma modes in the two - component 1d system ; the in - phase op with a typical 1d plasmon dispersion with the frequency proportional to @xmath0 at long wavelengths and the out - of - phase ap with its frequency linear in @xmath2 as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the 1d wave vector and @xmath3 is a characteristic 1d confinement size ( i.e. , roughly the wire width ) . unlike 2d and 3d systems , where the electron - hole pair continua have only an upper boundary , @xmath6 , the 1d pair continuum has also a low energy gap under the lower boundary @xmath7 , implying no low energy single particle excitations ( spe ) are allowed in 1d .",
    "this gap , the non - existence of low energy spe in 1d fermi systems , arises from severe phase space restrictions ( pauli exclusion principle ) imposed by 1d energy - momentum conservation , and leads to the possibility of the existence of an undamped plasmon mode in multi - component 1d systems@xcite .",
    "we find a low energy undamped ap mode in the double - quantum - wire system for arbitrary interwire separations ( including the zero separation case ) .",
    "in general , in higher dimensions , the collective mode spectral weight is mostly carried by the op , which makes the experimental observation of the ap mode in higher dimensions rather difficult .",
    "in contrast , we find that in quasi-1d systems the spectral weight of the undamped ap mode is comparable to that of the op mode and the spectral weight of the ap mode increases as the spatial separation increases , which is similar to the corresponding 2d situation",
    ". the greater relative spectral weight of the ap mode in 1d is directly related to the non - existence of low energy 1d spe .",
    "the plasma modes in 1d systems have vanishing frequencies at long wavelengths , and in general their energies at experimentally accessible wave vectors are small ( @xmath8 mev ) .",
    "their observability , therefore , depends rather crucially on the absence of appreciable damping or broadening in the system .",
    "while the absence of long wavelength landau damping ( to spe ) makes it feasible to discuss the observability of the ap mode , one must also have very small impurity broadening in order for the plasmon modes to be observable .",
    "impurity scattering causes the carrier motion to be diffusive assuming the scattering to be weak . in principle , any impurity disorder , no matter how weak , localizes all single electron 1d states ; for weak disorder , however , the localization length is larger than the system size and electron dynamics could be considered to be diffusive .",
    "the diffusive nature of the electronic dynamics strongly affects the plasmon dispersion in the long wavelength limit because the plasma frequency is vanishingly small at long wavelengths .",
    "the 1d plasmons therefore become overdamped due to impurity scattering induced level broadening at sufficiently long wavelengths .",
    "this plasmon level broadening may actually play a significant role in determining the physical characteristics in quantum wires .",
    "the collisional damping of the plasmon modes due to impurity scattering occurs in addition to the landau damping which arises from the decay of the plasmon to spe electron - hole pair excitations .",
    "( as emphasized above , while landau damping is suppressed in 1d , impurity broadening is always present unless the system is perfectly pure . ) in the single - component plasma , it is known that , as the impurity scattering increases , the collisional damping becomes strong and the plasmon mode becomes overdamped and disappears at small @xmath2 in 1d and 2d systems ( by contrast , this is a small effect in 3d since the plasmon energy is finite at zero wave vector ) @xcite .",
    "inclusion of impurity scattering in 1d and 2d overdamps the plasmon below a critical wave vector @xcite . this disappearance of the plasmon spectral weight at small @xmath2 has important consequences for the existence and characteristics of the fermi surface in a one dimensional electron gas @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the plasmon damping of the two - component 1d plasma in the presence of impurity scattering .",
    "( as noted above any finite impurity disorder leads to anderson localization of 1d one electron states , and therefore the 1d electron dynamics in the presence of impurity disorder is exponentially localized , _ not _ diffusive  this is , however , a purely academic point of little relevance to high quality gaas quantum wire systems with low disorder , where the localization lengths are many microns long and are in fact longer than the 1d sample lengths @xcite ; we are therefore justified in treating the effective electron dynamics as being diffusive , neglecting the anderson localization effects in high quality quantum wires of relevance to plasmon experiments . )",
    "we also discuss the effect of interwire electron tunneling on the bi - wire collective mode spectra .",
    "the most important qualitative feature of the plasmon dispersion in the presence of interwire tunneling is that , even though the in - phase op mode @xmath9 depends weakly on the tunneling , the out - of - phase ap mode @xmath10 , which is purely acoustic in the absence of tunneling ( @xmath11 ) , develops a plasmon gap at @xmath12 in the presence of nonzero tunneling ; the plasmon gap in the ap depends nontrivially on the 1d electron density @xmath13 , the interwire tunneling amplitude @xmath14 , and the interwire distance @xmath15 .",
    "tunneling , therefore , effectively changes the ap ( @xmath11 ) into an optical mode with a long wavelength gap .",
    "we use the rpa for most of our calculations . as emphasized",
    ", rpa is a very good approximation for the collective mode dispersion in 1d quantum wire structures by virtue of the essential vanishing of all vertex corrections to the 1d polarizability function .",
    "we consider the zero temperature case and assume that our quasi-1d system has an infinite square - well confinement with a finite width @xmath3 in the y - direction and a zero width in the z - direction .",
    "it is easy to include a finite width in the @xmath16 direction but our results do not change qualitatively . in typical quantum wires , the wire width along the growth direction ( z - direction ) is much smaller ( by an order of magnitude ) than that in the lateral direction ( y - direction ) , justifying our 2d finite width model for the 1d wire . in the finite - width 2d model we use a square",
    "well confining potential with infinite barriers at @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with the electron dynamics along the @xmath19-axis being free .",
    "confinement of the electrons in the @xmath20 and @xmath16 directions leads to the quantization of energy levels into different 1d subbands , and we assume the 1d extreme quantum limit where only the lowest subband is occupied by carriers , and all the 1d higher subbands are neglected .",
    "we study the plasmon modes of the spatially separated two - component system by taking two identical parallel quantum wires separated by a distance @xmath15 .",
    "we include results for the case @xmath21 because it applies directly to the photoexcited 1d ehp where electrons and holes are not spatially separated .",
    "we consider two different spatial configurations for our two - component bi - wire structure : two 1d wires with a spatial separation @xmath15 being parallel to each other aligned in the ( 1 ) @xmath22 plane ( separated along the @xmath20-axis ) and ( 2 ) @xmath23 plane ( separated along the @xmath16-axis ) .",
    "since the difference in our calculated results between these two configurations is within one percent , we only give the results for the configuration ( 1 ) .",
    "it is well - known that 1d electron systems are fundamentally different from their higher dimensional counterparts because 1d interacting electrons form a luttinger liquid , not a fermi liquid , and any electron - electron interaction , no matter how weak , destroys the fermi surface , i.e. , the discontinuity in the momentum distribution function , in 1d .",
    "it turns out , however , that this distinction , while being profound at a fundamental theoretical level ( because it implies the non - existence of quasiparticles in 1d systems ) , is rather irrelevant to the understanding of the collective mode spectra and their experimental realization in semiconductor quantum wire structures .",
    "as has been emphasized elsewhere , rpa gives a very good account of the collective mode properties in 1d semiconductor quantum wire structures , and we discuss this issue in some details in this paper in the context of the two - component 1d plasma .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we provide the basic rpa formalism as well as the calculated analytic and numerical results for plasmon dispersion , damping , and spectral weight by obtaining the dynamical structure factor ( which is a direct measure of the light scattering intensity ) ; in sec .",
    "iii we study the effects of the interwire electron tunneling in a bi - wire system on the collective charge density excitation spectra ; in sec . iv the plasmon dispersion and damping in the photoexcited 1d ehp is studied in both rpa and including local field corrections ; in sec .",
    "v we briefly discuss the acoustic plasmon mode of the two - component 1d luttinger liquid ; we conclude in sec .",
    "vi providing a brief summary of our results .",
    "in general , the density fluctuation spectra or the plasmons or the longitudinal collective modes of a solid state plasma are given by the poles of the density - density correlation function , or equivalently by the zeros of the dynamical dielectric function .",
    "for a multicomponent plasma the collective modes are given by the zeros of the generalized dielectric tensor @xmath24 .",

    "one conclusion of our ha - based calculations is that one should use higher ehp densities for an unambiguous observation of undamped 1d ap  this is consistent with our rpa results also , where landau damping is absent , because in rpa higher carrier densities imply quantitatively weaker effects of impurity level broadening .",
    "given the unique nature of the spe continua ( and the strong low energy suppression of landau damping ) in the 1d system , the question naturally arises about whether the collective mode behavior in 1d ehp is fundamentally different from that in 2d and 3d systems , where the ap mode is usually unobservable due to its unavoidable decay via landau damping to the electron(i.e . , the lighter mass component )",

    "the contrast between the rpa results for the 2d/3d ap mode ( figs . 8 and 9 ) and the 1d ap mode ( figs . 5 - 7 ) is striking in terms of landau damping  the 2d/3d ap mode is invariably landau damped by being inside the spe continuum of the lighter carrier component ( i.e. , the higher fermi velocity , @xmath263 , in our case ) where the 1d ap mode ( within rpa ) is undamped by being in the intermediate regime in between ( the spe `` gap '' regime ) the spe continua of the two components and is therefore _ not _ landau damped by either plasma component .",
    "this non - existence of ap landau damping in the spe `` gap '' regime in a 1d ehp is a fundamental one dimensional effect arising from the suppression of long wavelength single particle excitations peculiar to 1d .",

    "the fact that the 1d ap carries small spectral weight in spite of its lack of landau damping can be easily understood on the basis of the @xmath189-sum rule , which is essentially completely exhausted by the op in the long wavelength limit , leaving rather little spectral weight to be carried by the 1d ap in the long wavelength . at large wave vectors ( i.e. , away from the long wavelength limit ) , on the other hand",
    ", the ap is landau damped ( because it enters the spe continua ) and all collective modes start carrying little spectral weights .",
    "we therefore conclude this section on 1d ehp collective modes with two relatively modest conclusions : ( 1 ) in spite of the non - existence of ap landau damping in the 1d ehp within rpa , the calculated ap spectral weight is not much larger than the corresponding 2d situation ( it is , however , substantially larger than the corresponding 3d situation ) , and therefore the observability of 1d ehp ap should be only slightly more favorable than the corresponding 2d case ; ( 2 ) inclusion of local field corrections in general severely suppresses the ap spectral weight in the 1d ehp , and at least within the ha the ap becomes unobservable at lower densities .",

    "this paper is a two - component generalization of our earlier work @xcite where we studied the zero temperature collective charge density excitations of the one component 1d system in some details . in a separate earlier publication @xcite",
    "we consider a specific example of collective modes in a two - component 1d electron system ( namely , a two - subband 1d system ) in the context of obtaining quantitative agreement with the experimental results of ref . .",
    "in the current paper we refrain from repeating any results from these earlier publications @xcite of ours , and the current paper , along with refs . and , forms a reasonably complete quantitative description of possible low lying collective charge density excitations in 1d semiconductor quantum wire structures .",
    "our main results in this paper are the following : ( 1 ) there are two possible collective charge density excitations in a two - component 1d quantum plasma associated with the relative phase fluctuations in the two charge densities  the op mode is the in - phase ( out - of - phase ) mode when the two components are the same ( opposite ) kind ( both electrons or both holes versus one component electron and the other component hole ) and the ap is the out - of - phase ( in - phase ) mode in the same situation ( in general , the ap is essentially a neutral excitation at long wavelengths and the op is the collective oscillation of the total charge density ) ; ( 2 ) in contrast to higher dimensional systems where the ap mode is often landau damped because it lies in the spe continuum of the faster moving charge component , the 1d ap mode is invariably undamped at long wavelengths ( within rpa ) due to the severe suppression of long wavelength spe continua in 1d ; ( 3 ) this rpa result of the non - existence of long wavelength landau damping in the 1d ap mode is drastically affected by local field corrections , which at low density may overdamp the ap mode by pushing it inside the spe continua of both components  the op mode on the other hand is relatively robust with respect to local field corrections since its long wavelength dispersion is fixed by the @xmath189-sum rule ; ( 4 ) the ap mode in general carries little spectral weight at long wavelengths , and even at finite wave vectors its spectral weight is only slightly enhanced with respect to the corresponding 2d two - component situation , leading to the somewhat disappointing and unexpected conclusion that in spite of the complete suppression of the long wavelength spe continua in 1d systems the neutral ap mode is not substantially easier to observe in 1d than in 2d/3d systems ; ( 5 ) finite inter - wire separation in general enhances the ap spectral weight increasing its observability ; ( 6 ) finite impurity scattering induced level broadening gives rise to a critical wave vector below which the collective modes are always overdamped , and thus the concept of a long wavelength collective mode does not strictly apply ; ( 7 ) finite inter - wire tunneling produces a long wavelength plasma gap in the ap mode ; ( 8) luttinger liquid theory and fermi liquid - based rpa theory produce formally identical op and ap collective mode behavior in 1d two component systems making it impossible to observe any characteristic 1d luttinger liquid signature in the collective charge density excitation spectral in one dimension ; ( 9 ) the ap mode being strongly ( and qualitatively ) affected by the local field corrections ( with the op mode being relatively unaffected ) , in principle , it should be possible to investigate many body effects in 1d systems by studying the dispersion and damping of the ap mode ( the op mode on the other hand should be relatively insensitive to these many body corrections except at rather large wave vectors ) .    in our calculations",
    "we have concentrated on two distinct types of experimentally realizable two - component quasi-1d quantum plasmas confined in semiconductor ( gaas ) quantum wire nanostructures : spatially separated doped quantum double - wire structures and photoexcited homogeneous 1d ehp in a single wire .",
    "both systems are potentially interesting from the perspective of 1d collective excitation spectra and provide somewhat complementary information .",
    "our hope is that our detailed quantitative ( both numerical and analytical ) investigation of the collective mode dispersion and spectral weight in two - component 1d system will motivate experimental work ( involving inelastic light scattering and far infrared frequency domain spectroscopies ) on the subject searching for the 1d ap mode in quantum wire structures .",

    "<S> we find that both op and ap modes are overdamped by impurity scattering below some critical wave vector . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the long wavelength limit the spectral weight is carried mostly by the op , but the spectral weight of the undamped ap mode at finite ( but not too large ) wave vectors is comparable with that of the op mode , making it viable to observe the ap mode in semiconductor quantum wire systems . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the interwire electron tunneling in a biwire system on the collective charge density excitation spectra is also studied . </S>",
