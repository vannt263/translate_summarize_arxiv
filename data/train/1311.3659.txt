    "the traditional approach to deriving extinction curves is the `` pair method , '' in which the flux distribution or colours of a reddened object are compared with those of a star of the same spectral type ( e.g. massa , savage & fitzpatrick 1983 ; cardelli et al .",
    "1992 ; and references therein ) .",
    "this is possible because the interstellar extinction @xmath10 towards a given star can be determined by the ratio of its observed spectral energy distribution @xmath11 and the expected or intrinsic spectrum for this star @xmath12 , i.e.    @xmath13    in principle , the expected spectrum should be the one appropriate for an extinction - free star with the same spectral type , the same absolute luminosity and the same distance as the target star .",
    "since in general it is very hard to satisfy these conditions accurately , most of the studies are done considering the colour excess , @xmath14 , defined as    @xmath15 \\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    dealing with a ratio of ratios , this quantity is independent of the distance to the stars considered as well as of their radii .",
    "moreover , to separate the behaviour of the extinction from its absolute value for different pairs of stars or , equivalently , for different lines of sight , the colour excess is usually normalized .",
    "it is customary to take the ratio between a colour excess and the one in a reference wavelength interval @xmath16 , i.e.    @xmath17    which for example for @xmath18 , and @xmath19  becomes @xmath20 .",
    "the colour excess normalized in this way is the form usually adopted to describe the extinction curve , i.e. the run of the selective extinction , suitably normalized , as a function of the wavelength @xmath21 .",
    "we note that an implicit assumption underlying this procedure is that the extinction law is the same for all pairs of stars . with this procedure we can study and compare the slopes of the extinction laws between different stars and directions , and therefore derive relative dust properties , but",
    "still we do not have a characterization of the absolute value of the extinction .",
    "the latter is usually expressed in terms of the absolute extinction @xmath22 at wavelength @xmath21 , comparing the total extinction at that wavelength with that in the @xmath4 band .",
    "alternatively , it is also given by the parameter @xmath23 , which provides total to selective extinction in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands .",
    "to derive the absolute extinction measurements have to be extended to very long wavelengths , taking advantage of the physical properties of dust grains , whose extinction cross - section tends to zero when the wavelength approaches infinity , i.e. @xmath24 , and therefore the colour excess @xmath25 becomes    @xmath26    for many lines of sight accurate measurements today extend to the near - infrared , usually to the @xmath27 band , and it is a common practice to estimate values for @xmath28 from the extrapolation    @xmath29    based on the assumption that the theoretical extinction curve no .",
    "15 of van de hulst ( van de hulst 1949 , as reported by johnson 1968 ) is appropriate for the interstellar medium under study .",
    "however , as fitzpatrick & massa ( 2007 ) already pointed out , this extrapolation is necessarily only accurate if @xmath30 , since this is the value to which the van de hulst s theoretical curve no .",
    "15 applies , but it systematically deviates at higher and lower values of @xmath28 .    that @xmath28 varies considerably in our galaxy is well known , particularly thanks to the studies conducted in the 1970 s with the _ orbiting astronomical observatory 2 _ ( bless & savage 1972 ) , with the _ copernicus _ and _ td1 _ satellites ( e.g. seaton 1979 ) , and later with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ , which revealed a wide variety of extinction curves ( see e.g. fitzpatrick 1998 , 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "large variations are seen in the ultraviolet ( uv ) portion of the spectrum , with a more or less steep raise of the curve in the far - uv and a more or less prominent `` bump '' at 2175 , and in smaller amount also at optical wavelengths .    using the extrapolation to infinity mentioned above to derive @xmath28 , gordon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have carried out a quantitative comparison of all known extinction curves in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , respectively ) with the galactic curves .",
    "they find average @xmath28 values of @xmath31 for the smc wing ( one star ) , @xmath32 for the smc bar ( four stars ) , @xmath33 for the lmc supershell near the 30dor region ( eight stars ) and @xmath34 for lines of sight to ten stars elsewhere in the lmc .",
    "although these @xmath28 values are not too different from the average value found in the diffuse galactic interstellar medium ( @xmath35 ; e.g. savage & mathis 1979 ) , the majority of the magellanic clouds ( mc ) extinction curves that gordon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find are significantly different in the uv from the milky way ( mw ) extinction curves .",
    "these authors conclude that the environments probed by their observations , being biased towards active star forming regions , are rather different from those included in the sample studied by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1988 , 1989 ) , which is based on fairly quiescent lines of sight .",
    "recently , haschke , grebel & duffau ( 2011 ) , arguing that the differences between the mc extinction curves of gordon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and the galactic law by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) are quite small at optical wavelengths , concluded that the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) curve is generally a valid assumption also for the mc in that wavelength range .",
    "in fact , the differences appear small because the absolute extinction @xmath22 given by gordon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is normalized in the @xmath4 band , but considerable differences between the mc and the galaxy remain also at these wavelengths .    in this work we present a new method to unambiguously determine the absolute value of the extinction in the mc in all observed bands , deriving in this way an absolute extinction law .",
    "our method , originally presented by panagia & de marchi ( 2005 ) , makes use of multi - band photometry of red giant stars belonging to the red clump ( rc ) .",
    "other authors have used rc observations before to study the reddening distribution and to derive reddening maps in the mc ( e.g. zaritsky 1999 ; haschke et al . 2011 ; tatton et al .",
    "2013 ) , for an assumed extinction curve .",
    "however , these observations do not provide an independent determination of the extinction curve in the mc .",
    "recently , nataf et al .",
    "( 2013 ) used observations of rc stars in the galactic bulge , collected as part of the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) project ( paczynski 1986 ) , to determine the reddening and extinction towards the inner mw , finding a rather steep extinction curve ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , since only observations in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands are available as part of the ogle project ( supplemented by @xmath37 measurements from other surveys ) , these results can not be extended to shorter wavelengths .    instead , the novelty and advantage of our method consists in the facts that _ ( i ) _ all stars on which we operate are at the same distance , to better than 1% , _",
    "( ii ) _ they have very similar intrinsic physical properties in all bands , within @xmath38mag for similar age and metallicity , _ ( iii ) _ our statistics is very solid , with of the order of @xmath39 objects per field , and _",
    "( iv ) _ we derive a self - consistent _ absolute _ extinction curve over the entire optical range ( @xmath40 ) from photometry alone , without uncertain extrapolations from infrared bands . our method , whose application is shown here for a field in the vicinity of the 30dor nebula in the lmc , can easily be extended to other nearby galaxies .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the observations and their analysis are presented in section2 , while the results of the photometric reductions are shown in section3 .",
    "the physical properties of the red giant clump are discussed in section4 , while in section5 we proceed to deriving the absolute extinction law in the field of our study .",
    "section6 is devoted to a discussion of the reddening distribution in this field .",
    "a summary and our conclusions follow in section7 .",
    "the data used in our investigation were collected as part of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) / wide field planetary camera2 _ ( wfpc2 ) pure parallel programme ( see wadadekar et al .",
    "2006 ) and cover a region of @xmath41 on a side located at @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( j2000 ) , or about @xmath1sw of 30dor ( ngc2070 ) .",
    "this region was observed with the wfpc2 instrument ( mc master & biretta 2008 ) on board the hst on 2001 jan 6 and 7 in several bands .",
    "table1 lists the total duration of the long exposures in each band .",
    "in addition to these , a series of short exposures ( typically @xmath44s duration ) was collected in all bands to properly measure the magnitude of bright stars that would otherwise saturate .",
    ".cumulative exposure times in the various bands [ cols=\"<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab4 ]    to better quantify the difference in the reddening distribution of ums and rc stars we show in figure[fig14 ] the cumulative distributions of these objects , as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "a kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test shows that the probability that rc and ums stars come from the same distribution is very small , namely @xmath45 . as a sanity check",
    "we have also compared the distribution of the ums stars in the cluster ( short - dashed line ) and over the rest of the field ( long - dashed line ) , finding that they are indeed not significantly different ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , zaritsky ( 1999 ) reported that in the lmc stars with @xmath47k are typically affected by larger extinction values ( several tenths of a magnitude more ) than stars with @xmath48k@xmath49k .",
    "our results , therefore , appear at variance with zaritsky s ( 1999 ) conclusions , since figure[fig12 ] shows that the extinction towards rc stars can be considerably larger than that measured towards ums objects .",
    "note that we are confident about the nature of the rc objects , since we have only retained objects with @xmath50  in order to carefully exclude pms stars and other possible interlopers .",
    "in fact , that the reddening is on average less severe for young stars than for the older objects was recently found by sabbi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in the tarantula nebula , containing the 30dor region .",
    "as pointed out in that work , in his analysis zaritsky ( 1999 ) only considered stars that were detected simultaneously in all four photometric bands @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this works as a bias against the more extinguished old stars , since they are the first ones to drop below the detection limit in the @xmath2 band .",
    "therefore , it is possible that in zaritsky s ( 1999 ) study the average amount of reddening towards red giant branch stars might have been underestimated .    on the other hand , it is also possible that , with a field of view of @xmath51 or @xmath52pc on a side , our observations do not sample a region wide enough to probe a statistically representative sample of ums stars .",
    "for instance , the objects belonging to the small cluster have an even more limited spead of extinction than the other ums objects in the field because they occupy a small volume along the line of sight and , more in general , this might be true for the entire young population in this field .",
    "conversely , being older , stars like rc objects are more uniformly distributed . since we are probing a particular region of the lmc",
    ", there is no certainty that our findings apply in general to this galaxy .",
    "we plan to extend this study to a much wider area , using existing high qualify _ hst _ observations of the central regions of 30dor ( de marchi et al .",
    "2011b ) and of a large portion of the tarantula nebula ( sabbi et al .",
    "these observations will allow us to determine the reddening distribution towards both ums and rc stars over a region of active star formation , covering almost 1% of the entire area of the lmc .",
    "we have studied the properties of the interstellar extinction in a field of about @xmath53 on a side located about @xmath1 sw of 30dor in the lmc . the observations with with the wfpc2 on board the _ hst _ in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands show the presence of patchy extinction in this field .",
    "in particular , the cmd reveals an elongated stellar sequence , running almost parallel to the ms , which is in reality made up of rc stars spread across the cmd because of the considerable and uneven levels of extinction across this region .",
    "this allows us to derive in a quantitative way both the extinction law @xmath54 and the values of the absolute extinction @xmath55 towards about 100 objects , thereby setting statistically significant constraints on the properties of the extinction in this area .",
    "the main results of this work can be summarised as follows .    1 .   using theoretical cmds of the same type as those presented by girardi & salaris ( 2001 ) and salaris & girardi ( 2002 ) , but computed for the specific wfpc2 bands of our observations , and assuming a single stellar population ,",
    "we have studied the expected behaviour of the mean rc as a function of age ( from @xmath56gyr to @xmath57gyr ) and metallicity ( from @xmath58 to @xmath59 ) .",
    "we show that metallicity , age and reddening affect the position of rc stars in different ways in the cmds defined by our bands",
    "our analysis shows that the magnitude of the rc is not affected considerably by the age of the stars , except at very low metallicity . in bands longwards of @xmath60",
    "an increase of metallicity would move the rc along directions similar to the reddening vector .",
    "however this effect is small because even a change of metallicity by a factor of two would mimic a quite modest amount of reddening .",
    "this limited sensitivity of the rc to age and metallicity makes it easier to estimate the amount of reddening when there is considerable interstellar extinction ( @xmath61 ) , since in this case the magnitude and colour displacement of the rc in the cmd due to extinction dominate over all uncertainties on metallicity and age .",
    "3 .   to identify bona - fide rc stars ,",
    "we have compared our observations in all bands with the theoretical cmds for the metallicity range applicable to the lmc ( @xmath62 ) , taking into account the known distance modulus and intervening mw reddening .",
    "this allows us to define the region of the cmds where reddening can place rc stars , finding 170 objects inside it . with an iterative procedure ,",
    "we have reduced this number to a total of 107 bona - fide rc stars simultaneously classified as such in all cmds and with combined photometric uncertainty @xmath63mag .",
    "we have conservatively removed from this sample two bona - fide pms stars , with h@xmath64 excess emission in the range 10  @xmath65 , and additional ten objects with 3  @xmath66  that might also be pms stars .",
    "4 .   in each cmd",
    ", the best linear fit to the distribution of the bona - fide rc stars provides the absolute extinction and the ratio @xmath67 between absolute and selective extinction in the specific bands of our observations . through interpolation at the wavelengths of the johnson @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands ,",
    "we have derived the extinction curve in the form @xmath68 , in the range @xmath69 . adopting the parametrization of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and fitzpatrick & massa ( 1999 ) , in this wavelength range our extinction law is consistent with a value of @xmath70 with an uncertainty of @xmath71 .",
    "5 .   compared with the values reported in the diffuse galactic interstellar medium , where on average @xmath72 ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) , and with those towards 19 lines of sight in the lmc explored by gordon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , where on average @xmath73 , our larger @xmath28 value indicates a considerably flatter extinction law , which in turn implies that in this region larger grains dominate .",
    "since larger @xmath28 values are usually found in denser regions , it is possible that the specific area that we have studied is simply denser than those sampled in the lmc so far .",
    "more in general , it could be the result of systematically different conditions of the environments in the lmc as compared to the mw .",
    "6 .   having derived the extinction law in this region , we have compared the extinction towards individual rc and ums stars in order to study the relative distribution of stars and dust in this field .",
    "we find that ums objects span a narrower range of @xmath9 values than rc stars , at variance with the conclusion of zaritsky ( 1999 ) that in the lmc stars with @xmath74k are typically affected by larger extinction than stars with @xmath48k @xmath75k .",
    "while it is plausible that in zaritsky s ( 1999 ) study the average amount of reddening towards red giants might have been underestimated ( see sabbi et al . 2013 ) , it is also possible that we are probing a peculiar region of the lmc .    in summary , in this work we have shown how to use multi - band _ hst _ photometry of a resolved stellar population to efficiently derive simultaneously the extinction law and the absolute value of the extinction towards a large number of rc stars in a typical lmc field .",
    "when the distance to the sources and their metallicity range are known , which is the case of any field in the mc , the average location of the rc in a cmd can be used to derive the absolute extinction towards its individual members by comparison with theoretical models .",
    "we have shown how multi - band photometry , and particularly the inclusion of the @xmath2 band , can be used to lift the degeneracy introduced by uncertainties on the age and metallicity .",
    "the results are statistically significant because several dozen rc stars are present in the average mc field .    furthermore ,",
    "when the amount of the extinction is high and variable across the field , like in the region that we have studied , also the extinction law can be accurately derived , in absolute terms . in general , when there is measurable extinction , even without an appreciable spread , one can still determine the extinction law from the displacement between expected and actual rc locations , as recently done for instance by nataf et al .",
    "( 2013 ; see also udalski 2003 and sumi 2004 , and references therein ) using the ogle observations of the galactic bulge . however , the determination in this case is less reliable , because the lack of a clear reddening track makes the identification of spurious systematic effects much harder .",
    "the advantage of our method is that the rc stars that we consider in our study are all at the same distance , to within 1% , that they have very similar intrinsic physical properties in all bands , and that we can derive the absolute value of the extinction without having to extend the observations to infrared bands .",
    "so far our investigation using this method has covered a single field near 30dor , in which we find a much shallower extinction law than so far reported for the lmc , corresponding to @xmath76 .",
    "we plan to apply this method to existing _",
    "observations of the 30dor cluster and of the tarantula nebula at large , in order to investigate whether this extinction law is characteristic of other regions of intense star formation in the mc .",
