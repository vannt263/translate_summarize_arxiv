    "the braking torque causes the stars to spiral inward , so that their separation and period diminish with time",
    ". such orbital decay may be significant in the very densest molecular clumps .",
    "in particular , infrared dark clouds , currently believed to be the birthsites of massive stars , have peak number densities as high as @xcite .",
    "this impressive figure matches that in hot molecular cores , already known to contain luminous , high - mass objects @xcite .",
    "binary mergers could be occurring in these environments , and could play a role in forming the massive stars .",
    "there is still no direct evidence that either infrared dark clouds or hot molecular cores contain low - mass stars .",
    "however , observations show that , with few exceptions , massive stars originate in populous clusters @xcite .",
    "indeed , one account of high - mass star formation is that it proceeds through the coalescence of lower - mass cluster members @xcite . at even the highest observed cluster densities ,",
    "collisions between stars , either bare or with extended disks , occur at too low a frequency .",
    "however , the presence of dense , background gas should enhance the capture rate @xcite .",
    "specifically , the braking torque from dynamical friction might not only shrink initially wide binaries , but cause the component stars to merge .",
    "an accelerating succession of such mergers could then build up massive stars .    to assess this possibility",
    ", the present study calculates the torque on a binary embedded within an extensive gas cloud .",
    "although the torque is created by dynamical friction , the usual analysis of that effect is difficult to apply in this context .",
    "following @xcite , theorists have determined the frictional drag on a single mass traveling through ambient gas in a straight line ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "just as in the stellar dynamical case @xcite , the moving mass draws external matter into a trailing wake .",
    "it is the gravitational tug from this wake that provides the effective drag .",
    "the same essential mechanism is at work in the case of a binary .",
    "however , the trajectories of both perturbing masses are now closed orbits . further complicating the analysis is the fact that each star draws in matter from the wake of its companion .",
    "naive application of the standard dynamical friction formulae would grossly misestimate the torque .",
    "the new approach introduced here concentrates on the fact that the binary as a whole must shed angular momentum to the external medium .",
    "the actual mechanism is that the orbiting stars create an oscillating gravitational potential that torques nearby gas .",
    "this fluctuating torque generates outgoing acoustic waves , which transport angular momentum . by calculating the total angular momentum efflux from the binary",
    ", the braking torque may be obtained without considering the complex star - gas interaction close to the stars themselves .",
    "section  2 below formulates the problem mathematically and derives the governing wave equation .",
    "the quadrupolar driving potential created by the rotating stars is established in section  3 , while section  4 discusses the physical character of the generated waves .",
    "section  5 presents the central result of this investigation . here the angular momentum transported by the spiral wave is obtained , and thereby the torque ( see eq .",
    "it is also shown that the wave carries off all the mechanical energy released by the shrinking binary .",
    "the resulting temporal evolution of the system is considered in section  6 , along with the efficacy of braking in infrared dark clouds .",
    "finally , section  7 compares the results obtained here with the traditional analysis and discusses future extensions of this study .",
    "we wish to treat the binary as a perturbing mass embedded in otherwise static , uniform gas .",
    "if the binary itself recently formed , then gas surrounding it would not be perfectly quiescent .",
    "hence , our assumed background is a highly idealized representation of a real cloud , or at least that portion of a cloud in which we can accurately follow the propagation of acoustic waves from the stars .",
    "one obvious stipulation is that this region can not be so close to the binary that cloud gas is infalling onto the stars .",
    "this requirement sets an inner radius of validity for the analysis , which we take to be the sonic point in the bondi accretion problem :    @xmath1    here , @xmath2 is the total binary mass and @xmath3 the sound speed of the surrounding gas , assumed to be isothermal . in the numerical evaluation of @xmath4 , we have used for @xmath3 the typical observed velocity dispersion of infrared dark clouds @xcite . inside @xmath4 , where the binary itself may reside",
    ", gas falls freely onto the central stars .",
    "if the binary separation , to be denoted as @xmath5 , exceeds @xmath4 , then each orbiting star is surrounded by its own zone of infall . in that case , @xmath5 becomes the appropriate inner boundary .",
    "this comparison of @xmath5 relative to @xmath4 effectively distinguishes two cases : `` hard '' binaries , in which the relative speed of the component stars is supersonic with respect to the gas and `` soft '' binaries , for which this speed is subsonic .",
    "we shall concentrate on the first case , since it yields , as we shall see in section  4 , a simplified form of the acoustic disturbance .",
    "we also require that our propagation region is not so spatially extended that the dominant gravitational force is from interior gas rather than the stars .",
    "thus , we are confined within another radius @xmath6 , where the mass of background gas rivals that of the stars . for an @xmath7 number density of @xmath8 , representating the most compact regions of infrared dark clouds , we find that @xmath9 is contained in . beyond even this point",
    ", theory indicates , and observations confirm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that the mass density @xmath10 falls off in response to the self - gravity of the cloud as a whole .",
    "this outermost radius is the jeans length @xmath11 , where    @xmath12    our wave analysis is thus valid within a somewhat restricted , but well - defined , dynamic range .    by the same token , we _ can not _ model , using this method , binaries embedded within the dense cores characterizing low - mass star formation environments ( see * ? ? ? * for observations of candidate stellar pairs ) . here , the entire cloud mass is comparable to the stellar @xmath2 , and .",
    "physically , the dynamics inside such a dense core is dominated by infall onto the binary , unless the cloud is stabilized by tension in its internal magnetic field .",
    "acoustic waves may propagate outside the cloud , but their source would be both the stars and the dense core gas .",
    "we now introduce our central object , the binary .",
    "let the component stars have masses @xmath13 and @xmath14 , whose values are in the ratio @xmath15 , where . we assume , for simplicity , that the two are on circular orbits about their mutual center of mass , with radii @xmath16 and @xmath17 . for a given @xmath2 , @xmath15 , and , the fixed separation between the stars , we want to ascertain the perturbing effect of the binary on the surrounding cloud , taken to have a background density of @xmath18 .    in the linear approximation valid for small disturbances ,",
    "momentum conservation reads @xmath19 here we have denoted the small induced velocity by @xmath20 , and have used the same subscript for perturbations in the density and potential .",
    "the superscript on @xmath21 emphasizes that this perturbation is due to the stars alone .",
    "the equation of mass continuity is , again to linear order , @xmath22 in practice , the term @xmath23 in the momentum equation is relatively small .",
    "however , this term can not be discarded , as it is the stellar gravity that ultimately drives the outoging waves .",
    "the next step is to manipulate equations  ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) to obtain a wave equation for @xmath24 . taking the divergence of equation  ( 3 ) yields @xmath25 but the time derivative of equation  ( 4 ) may be cast as @xmath26 combining the last two equations yields @xmath27 where @xmath28 obeys poisson",
    "s equation : @xmath29    equation  ( 5 ) is the inhomogeneous wave equation used in all analyses of dynamical friction in gases . in previous studies , however , the source density @xmath28 tracks the straight - line trajectory of the gravitating mass . after solving the wave equation for @xmath24 , the retarding force on that mass is calculated . in our case , the gravitating mass is spatially confined .",
    "it is thus more convenient to idealize @xmath28 as being non - zero only at the origin .",
    "this singular , `` equivalent density '' for the binary is derived in the next section , where we also show how its temporal change generates acoustic waves .",
    "we have written the source term of the wave equation  ( 5 ) in terms of the equivalent density @xmath28 . to derive this density ,",
    "we begin with @xmath21 , the potential due to the binary . for any spatially compact source ,",
    "the potential is conveniently expressed as a sum over multipoles .",
    "equation  ( 4.2 ) of @xcite gives the electrostatic expression ; this is readily altered to the gravitational one : @xmath30 here , the multipole moments are found from the source density ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 4.3 ) ) : @xmath31 in these two expressions , primed coordinates refer to source points , and unprimed ones to the field points where @xmath21 is measured .",

    "also indicated are two of the three coordinates @xmath34 of a field point . at time @xmath35 , mass @xmath13 is a distance from the origin , and has rotated from the @xmath32-axis by the azimuthal angle , where @xmath36 is the binary s angular speed .",

    "we now investigate what distribution of matter generates the potential @xmath21 .",
    "this equivalent density @xmath28 is a simplified representation of the binary that gives rise , through its fluctuating potential , to the same acoustic waves .",
    "direct calculation reveals that outside the origin .",
    "thus , the equivalent density is confined to .",
    "we already know that the monopole term in @xmath21 is generated by a mass @xmath2 at the origin .",
    "we shall denote this portion of the equivalent density as @xmath47 , and caution the reader not to confuse the double subscript with that in the quadrupole moments @xmath37 .",
    "we then have @xmath48 higher multipole terms in the potential similarly have sources , i.e. , further contributions to the equivalent density , that are combinations of @xmath49 functions and their derivatives , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole portion of the equivalent density is illustrated in figure  2 .",
    "here we show a symmetric placement of point masses that generates the corresponding part of @xmath21 .",
    "we replace the real binary by two equal masses lying along the binary s azimuthal direction within the @xmath32-@xmath33 plane .",

    "it may also be verified that all dipole moments are zero .",
    "the quadrupole moment for is @xmath55 in agreement with equation  ( 11 ) .",

    "many terms cancel , leaving @xmath60 where    @xmath61    notice that @xmath56 varies temporally with a frequency twice that of the binary itself .",
    "the reason for this doubling is that the simplified configuration in figure  2 repeats itself every half period .",
    "that is , any _ difference _ in the component masses manifests itself only in higher - order multipole terms .",
    "the full equivalent density is @xmath62 since we have purposefully designed @xmath28 to have the same monopole and quadrupole moments as the real binary , the generated potential must be given by equation  ( 16 ) .",
    "nevertheless , an important check is to verify this fact directly , through integraton of poisson s equation .",
    "we carry out the relevant calculation in the appendix .",
    "to find @xmath24 , we substitute our expression for @xmath28 into the wave equation  ( 5 ) . the static portion of @xmath28 , given by @xmath47 in equation  ( 17 ) , similarly generates a static contribution to @xmath24 , which we denote as @xmath63 . that is , @xmath63 obeys @xmath64 because of the linearity of the full wave equation , @xmath63 can ( and should ) be added to the time - varying part we shall derive shortly .",
    "equation  ( 23 ) is poisson s equation , describing the potential from a point mass located at the origin .",
    "the value of this fictitious `` mass '' is .",
    "we may immediately write down the solution : @xmath65 a similar , but modified , expression applies to the wake created by a moving mass in the traditional dynamical friction problem .",
    "@xcite has noted that equation  ( 24 ) is the linear approximation to the full density in a hydrostatic envelope surrounding a gravitating mass @xmath2 : @xmath66 the sharp density rise interior to predicted by equation  ( 25 ) does not actually occur .",
    "as we have described , gas in this region instead goes into free - fall collapse onto the stars .",
    "the linear result given by equation  ( 24 ) is thus the appropriate form for the static density enhancement .",
    "is needed to balance the static part of the quadrupole potential .",
    "] however , @xmath63 makes no contribution to the angular momentum transport . in calculating the latter",
    ", we shall be multiplying the density by the induced , azimuthal velocity .",
    "since the latter oscillates sinusoidally , the product vanishes over a period .",
    "we therefore turn to the oscillating density perturbation .      from now on ,",
    "we may omit @xmath47 when considering the equivalent density .",
    "the time - varying density perturbation , which we shall continue to denote simply as @xmath24 , obeys @xmath67 where @xmath56 is given by equations  ( 20)-(21 ) .",
    "we proceed by finding those parts of @xmath24 ( denoted @xmath68 , etc . ) generated by each additive component of @xmath56 .",
    "linearity of the wave equation ensures that we can add these individual solutions to obtain the full one .",
    "consider first the functions @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 obeying    @xmath72    if we can find these three functions , then differentiation of their governing wave equations reveals that    @xmath73    each of the wave equations ( 27a)-(27c ) may be solved using the retarded greens function . applying equations  ( 6.54 ) and ( 6.66 ) of @xcite , and integrating over the @xmath49 functions , we find    @xmath74    where the wave number .",
    "in taking spatial derivatives of these last three expressions , we utilize the fact that we are in the far - field limit . to see this , note first that @xmath75 since our field point is located well outside @xmath4 , we have , for hard binaries , @xmath76 we conclude that @xmath77 following the usual practice in acoustics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 1 ) , we apply spatial derivatives only to the phase .",
    "derivatives of the prefactors of @xmath69 , etc . involving @xmath78 are smaller by one or two powers of @xmath79 .",
    "differentiation of equations  ( 29a)-(29c ) , under the far - field approximation , yields expressions for the density components :    @xmath80    adding these gives the full density perturbation : @xmath81    it is important to understand , in a qualitative sense , the amplitude of the density perturbation in equation  ( 31 ) .",
    "the relative perturbation , @xmath82 , created by a simple point mass ( a monopole ) is of order @xmath83 , according to equation  ( 24 ) .",
    "however , our oscillating density perturbation is quadrupolar .",
    "thus , the monopole result must be multiplied by two powers of @xmath84 .",
    "the amplitude in equation  ( 31 ) is indeed of order .",
    "as expected , the perturbation is an acoustic wave that travels radially outward with phase velocity . at any time",
    ", the phase of the wave is also dependent on @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , equation  ( 31 ) reveals that the disturbance may also be viewed as a trailing , two - armed spiral wave , with a latitude - dependent amplitude that peaks at the equator .",
    "since , the spiral is tightly wrapped , with a relatively small pitch angle .",
    "figure  3 illustrates the basic geometry of the wave .",
    "shown are wavefronts ( surfaces of constant phase ) for the two spiral arms in the equatorial plane .",
    "if we trace one arm around the circle , the radius of the front increases by . however , because a second arm is interleaved , the actual radial wavelength of the disturbance is @xmath86 , with an associated wavenumber of @xmath87 .",
    "the perturbation s angular frequency is @xmath88 , so the outward velocity is again .",
    "we next determine the velocity created in the gas by the passing wave .",
    "taking the curl of the momentum equation  ( 3 ) , we find that @xmath89 thus , the induced vorticity is independent of time , and is zero for oscillatory motion .",
    "it follows that the velocity may be written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the velocity potential . from the mass continuity equation  ( 4 ) ,",
    "@xmath91 obeys @xmath92    if we assume that @xmath91 depends on the same phase as @xmath24 , then the dominant contribution to @xmath93 in the far - field limit is simply @xmath94 .",
    "using @xmath95 from equation  ( 31 ) , we find that @xmath96 finally , we may read off from equation  ( 32 ) the velocity components :    @xmath97    in deriving @xmath98 , we again applied the radial derivative to the phase only .",
    "we see also that this velocity component is larger than the other two by a factor of order .",
    "such dominance of the radial velocity is expected for a wavefront with small pitch angle .",
    "while relatively small , the @xmath85-component is critical for angular momentum transport .",
    "we may also obtain @xmath99 directly from the momentum equation  ( 3 ) .",
    "the gradient of the monopole contribution to @xmath21 is balanced by the static density perturbation previously derived .",
    "equation  ( 16 ) shows that there is also a static part of the quadrupolar potential .",
    "this is balanced by a smaller term in the static density perturbation .",
    "that is , the total static perturbation , to quadrupole order , is @xmath100    the remaining , oscillatory part of @xmath21 contributes in principle to the fluctuating velocity .",
    "however , if we actually compare its gradient to the force associated with the pressure gradient , we find the @xmath21-gradient to be smaller by several powers of . in the far - field limit , therefore , the velocity is actually generated only by @xmath24 , as equation  ( 33 ) already indicates .",
    "if we express the oscillating part of @xmath24 as the real part of a complex exponential , and set @xmath101 then we may solve the momentum equation for @xmath99 itself , obtaining the same velocity components as above .",
    "imagine surrounding the binary with a spherical shell of radius @xmath78 .",
    "we wish to determine the outflow of angular momentum through this shell . for the acoustic wave to have the properties we ascribed to it",
    ", @xmath78 must lie between @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath51-component of specific angular momentum at any point on the shell is , with @xmath102 given by equation  ( 35c ) .",
    "additionally , the mass flux through this same point is @xmath103 , where @xmath98 is taken from equation  ( 35a ) .",
    "the flux of angular momentum , which we denote as @xmath104 , is therefore    @xmath105    in the last expression , we have used for @xmath10 its equilibrium value @xmath18 . since the product already falls off as @xmath106 , any density variation that declines with radius does not appear in the total angular momentum efflux , integrated over the sphere .    by angular momentum conservation , this outflow , which we denote @xmath107 , must also be @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the torque exerted on the binary by surrounding gas .",
    "that is @xmath110 using @xmath111 we arrive at our main result : @xmath112    a striking aspect of the torque is its high sensitivity to the sound speed @xmath3 .",
    "it is more difficult to gather hotter gas into the wakes that actually provide the gravitational tug on the orbiting stars .",
    "an inverse dependence on @xmath3 is also present in the expressions for @xmath24 and @xmath113 ( see equations  ( 31 ) and ( 35a)-(35c ) ) . in any event ,",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath109 to @xmath3 means that quantitative conclusions regarding astrophysical effects of the torque are necessarily rather imprecise .",
    "the outgoing acoustic wave transports not only angular momentum , but also mechanical energy .",
    "we first note , from equations  ( 35a)-(35c ) and the succeeding comments , that the kinetic energy density in the far field simplifies to @xmath114 now the _ total _ energy density of any acoustic wave , including",
    "the component associated with compression by the enhanced pressure , is twice this kinetic value ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  1.3 ) .",
    "since the wave travels radially outward at the sound speed , the total energy flux past any point is @xmath115    it is instructive to compare this result with @xmath104 , the angular momentum flux in equation  ( 37a ) . from equations  ( 35a ) and ( 35c ) , we have @xmath116 thus , the angular momentum flux may be written as @xmath117 where we have again replaced the density by its equilibrium value . integrating @xmath118 and @xmath104 over the entire shell ,",
    "we obtain a relationship between the global energy loss rate @xmath119 and @xmath107 : @xmath120    since both the energy and angular momentum are being extracted from the binary , the same relationship between their loss rates should apply to that system .",
    "we now show that this is the case . referring back to figure  1 ,",
    "the angular momentum of the binary is @xmath121 the binary s total energy is @xmath122 but we also have @xmath123 from this equation , applying standard manipulations , we find that the potential energy is @xmath124 so that @xmath125 comparison with equation  ( 43 ) reveals that @xmath126    we next relate the temporal change of @xmath127 to that of @xmath36 .",
    "we first note that the binary s moment of inertia may be written in terms of the separation @xmath5 and mass ratio @xmath15 : @xmath128 thus , if we again use equation  ( 44 ) to eliminate @xmath5 , the angular momentum may be written as @xmath129 during contraction of the binary , therefore , @xmath130 taking the time derivative of equation  ( 46 ) and applying equation  ( 49 ) now gives @xmath131 as claimed earlier , the energy and angular momentum of the binary change at the same relative rates as these same quantities in the outgoing wave .",
    "the rate of energy transport by the wave can be recast in another way that provides a check on our derivation .",
    "we first note , after applying equation  ( 47 ) to the negative of equation  ( 39 ) , that @xmath132 if we then use equation  ( 44 ) to eliminate @xmath133 in favor of @xmath5 and @xmath36 , we obtain @xmath134 thus the energy emission rate can be written as @xmath135 for fixed @xmath5 , the binary components relative speed scales with @xmath36 .",
    "this last expression thus reproduces the fact that the acoustic energy radiated by a quadrupolar source increases as the eighth power of the mach number @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to follow the binary s orbital decay in time . for this purpose ,",
    "we use for the torque the negative of @xmath107 in equation  ( 51 ) .",
    "however , it is now appropriate to eliminate @xmath5 , again employing equation  ( 44 ) : @xmath136 we set this torque equal to the temporal derivative of @xmath127 , as given in equation  ( 48 ) .",
    "rearrangement gives an equation for the evolution of @xmath36 : @xmath137    equation  ( 54 ) is readily integrated .",
    "if @xmath138 is the initial , nondimensional angular rotation rate , then @xmath139 where the coalesence time @xmath140 is    @xmath141    at time @xmath140 ,  @xmath36 diverges and the binary has contracted to zero separation . in our numerical evaluation of this time , we have set and used the initial binary period @xmath142 in place of the angular velocity @xmath138 . for",
    ", a period of corresponds to . shortens the coalescence time @xmath140 . ]    finally , we may determine the mechanical energy release of the decaying binary as a function of time .",
    "setting and taking @xmath109 from equation  ( 53 ) , we have    @xmath143    here , we have supplied the time dependence of @xmath36 from equation  ( 55 ) . the constant @xmath144 is @xmath145 and has the value @xmath146 for our fiducial parameters .",
    "evidently , the energy release does not rival the radiative loss from the stars themselves until very late during the inspiral , when @xmath35 is within a few percent of @xmath140 . at this point ,",
    "the stars are separated by several au .",
    "we may compare , at least in a qualitative manner , our derived torque with that indicated by the traditional theory of dynamical friction . according to equation  ( 12 ) of @xcite",
    ", the retarding force on a mass @xmath147 moving at speed @xmath148 through a cloud of density @xmath18 is @xmath149 the factor @xmath150 , essentially a coulomb logarithm , is a nondimensional function of the mach number @xmath151 and the time since the mass first entered the cloud in question .",
    "since @xmath150 will generally be of order unity , we may ignore it , along with other such factors , in the dimensional argument that follows .    to apply this formula to the binary problem ,",
    "we interpret @xmath148 as the components relative velocity @xmath152 , which is @xmath153 .",
    "then the torque is of order , so that @xmath154 here , the moment of inertia has been approximated as .",
    "comparison to equation  ( 39 ) shows that @xmath155 is the true @xmath109 multiplied by a factor .",
    "this factor can be much smaller than unity for the hard binaries of interest .",
    "on the other hand , the nondimensional @xmath150 formally diverges for a velocity of @xmath3 .",
    "the traditional theory is thus unreliable in this context .",
    "however , it is not difficult to envision circumstances in which the present theory requires modification . from equation  ( 35a )",
    ", the mach number associated with the radial velocity amplitude is @xmath156 since , the induced velocity is normally subsonic . for binaries that are initially very hard , or late during the inspiral of any system , @xmath98 throughout the far field",
    "becomes supersonic .",
    "the disturbance then changes character from an acoustic wave to a tightly wound spiral shock . in the same regime ,",
    "the density perturbation @xmath24 is comparable to or even exceeds @xmath18 , so that a fully nonlinear treatment is necessary .",
    "additional modification of the theory would be required by the inclusion of a finite eccentricity in the binary orbits .",
    "while the system would still be periodic , the equivalent quadrupolar source would exhibit variation over a continuous distribution of frequencies .",
    "the same frequency distribution would then appear in the transmitted waves .",
    "it would be interesting to recalculate both the torque and energy loss under this more general condition and thereby follow the evolution of the eccentricity during orbital decay .",
    "returning to the theory s main astrophysical application , our result for the coalescence time is a reasonable one that adds credence to the underlying picture .",
    "the nearest and best - studied region of massive star formation is the orion nebula cluster , whose general population formed 1 - 2  myr ago @xcite .",
    "we do not know the age of the high - mass members , the trapezium , with any precision .",
    "@xcite have argued that they are relatively young , of order @xmath157 , based on the location of bm  ori and its binary companion in the hr diagram .",
    "assuming that the trapezium stars , along with their companions , are coeval , their inferred age provides an upper bound to the formation time scale .",
    "we are thus encouraged by this matching of times .",
    "we stress , however , that our expression for @xmath140 in equation  ( 56 ) varies inversely with the imprecisely known ambient density @xmath158 .",
    "if massive stars indeed coalesce over such a period , perhaps they do so through an accelerating sequence of binary mergers .",
    "the binaries themselves might be created and disrupted rapidly out of the dense gas , leading to a statistically stable period distribution , as originally envisioned by @xcite . within this picture , one could in principle determine the mass distribution of the growing population of coalesced objects , thereby advancing the theory another significant step .",
    "this project was originally inspired by extensive discussions with avery broderick concerning the formation of massive stars .",
    "kevin bundy provided useful comments on a preliminary draft of the manuscript .",
    "the author was partially supported by nsf grant ast-0908573 .",
    "we wish to verify that @xmath28 in equation  ( 22 ) indeed generates the gravitational potential @xmath21 in equation  ( 16 ) .",
    "it is evident that the monopolar portion @xmath47 in equation  ( 17 ) does yield the term @xmath159 .",
    "we therefore focus on @xmath56 , given in equations  ( 20)-(21 ) , and verify that @xmath160 where @xmath161 \\,\\,.\\ ] ]                        bally , j. & zinnecker , h. 2005 , , 129 , 2281 beuther , h. , churchwell , e. b. , mckee , c. f. , & tan , j. c. 2007 , in protostars and planets v , eds . b. reipurth , d. jewitt , & k. keil , tucson : u. of arizona press , 165 bonnell , i. a. , bate , m. r. , & zinnecker , h. 1998 , , 298 , 93 butler , m. s. & tan , j. c. 2009 , , 696 , 484 chandrasekhar , s. 1943 , , 97 , 255 de wit , w. j. , testi , l. , palla , f. , & zinnecker , h. 2005 , , 437 , 247 dokuchaev , v. p. 1964 , sov .",
