    "detailed studies of generic self - gravitating systems are only possible with the aid of complex numerical methods .",
    "part of the complication arises from the long range nature of gravitational interactions .",
    "thus , even equilibrium states , when they exist , do not in general obey standard statistical mechanics .",
    "this is correct for both newtonian gravity as well as general relativity ( gr ) , but the latter adds its peculiar technical and conceptual challenges .",
    "analytic or semi - analytic treatment of systems possessing special symmetries are , therefore , of great interest .",
    "gravity is the dominant force dictating the growth of structure in the universe .",
    "thus , self - gravitating perturbations in an expanding cosmological has traditionally gained a great deal of attention ( cf .",
    "peebles 1990 ) . here",
    "we present a class of solutions which describe the evolution of spherical perturbations in an expanding einstein - de sitter cosmological background .",
    "we focus on the evolution of self - similar perturbations in gr .",
    "self - similarity occurs when dimensionless physical variables can be expressed as functions of some combination of the time and space coordinates .",
    "self - similar systems offer great simplification since they are described by ordinary differential equations .",
    "newtonian treatment of cosmological self - similar perturbations have been presented in great detail previously in the literature ( e.g. fillmore & goldreich 1984 ; bertschinger 1985 ; chuzhoy & nusser 2000 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is instructive to review the general features of these solutions . in cosmology ,",
    "we assume that the density fluctuations are extremely small at time , @xmath5 , close to the the big bang singularity .",
    "an isolated small density perturbation having the form @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the distance from the symmetry center ) at @xmath5 , develops a self - similar behavior at sufficiently late times , @xmath8 is equal to that of the unperturbed background .",
    "this assumption is , however , unnecessary as long as the deviations from the background expansion rate are not great . ] .",
    "consider first a positive density perturbation in a universe made solely of dust ( i.e. collision - less matter ) .",
    "as time goes - by a shell of matter begins to expand at a rate lower than the background until it reaches a maximum distance from the center .",
    "the shell then falls inward and ends up oscillating around the center together with shells which have reached it at earlier times .",
    "according to this picture , the radius , @xmath9 , of the shell which is at maximum expansion at time @xmath10 plays an important role .",
    "for @xmath11 , matter is still expanding , while at @xmath12 shells of matter are oscillating in the central potential well generated by their self - gravity .",
    "the self - similar variable can then be taken to be the ratio , @xmath13 . for a universe filled with a collisional fluid ( gas )",
    ", self - similarity develops provided the initial pressure is negligible and that the gas is able to shock and evolve adiabatically . in this case , an inner region of hot shocked gas develops .",
    "the shock bounding this region propagates away from the center at a rate @xmath14 .",
    "self - similarity in gr is obtained for a more restricted class of initial perturbations than in newtonian gravity .",
    "gr admits self - similar solutions only for specific values of the power law index @xmath15 , while newtonian dynamics does not impose such restrictions .",
    "further , the pressure , @xmath0 , must be related linearly to the energy - density , @xmath1 , of matter ( cahil & taub 1971 ) .",
    "carr & hawking ( 1974 ) and carr & yahil ( hereafter cy90 ) have studied self - similar perturbations in an expanding universe .",
    "their treatment , however , did not include shocks which might form as a result of collapse or energy injection into the system .",
    "here we complement the work of cy90 by exploring solutions which involve shock discontinuities .",
    "we assume that the isotropic cosmic background is made of cold pressure - less matter that is able to shock",
    ". we will present solutions in which shocks propagate from a central point into the uniform cosmic background or into the outer regions of a perturbation with positive excess of energy - density in the cold gas .",
    "shock - heated gas will be assumed to obey the equation of state @xmath2 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we also present solutions with no shocks for @xmath4 , a case which has not been discussed at length in the literature before .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : eom ] we summarize gr equations for self - similar perturbations in comoving coordinates . for a detailed discussion of these equations",
    "we refer the reader to cy90 and carr & coley ( 2000 ) ( hereafter cc02 ) . in  [ sec : shock ] we discuss the formation of shocks and the jump conditions relating the physical variables on both sides of the shock discontinuity . in  [ sec : num ] we present full numerical solutions .",
    "we conclude with a general discussion in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we work with comoving coordinates as they are particularly convenient for the study of cosmological perturbations . with only minor changes of notation",
    "our description of the equations closely follows cy90 and cc02 . denoting the time , the radius and the two spherical angular coordinates by @xmath10 , @xmath7 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the space - time metric is expressed in terms of the interval @xmath19 as ( e.g. landau & lifshitz 1975 ) , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , in general , functions of @xmath10 and @xmath7 , and @xmath24 . in comoving coordinates the energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 . for an equation of state @xmath27 where @xmath3 is a constant , self - similar solutions in which dimensionless variables are functions of @xmath28 alone",
    "can be obtained .",
    "we use the following dimensionless variables defined here is related to @xmath29 in cy90 by @xmath30 . ] , @xmath31 where @xmath32 \\ ; .\\ ] ] using @xmath33 , gives @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "for @xmath2 , these equations yield @xmath36 substituting these relations in the remaining einstein equations and using @xmath37 and @xmath38 yield @xmath39\\left(\\frac{2}{1+w}\\frac{\\dot s}{s}-\\frac{\\dot \\xi}{\\xi}\\right)=0 \\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath40 @xmath41\\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath42 and @xmath43 where an over - dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath44 .",
    "a particular solution of these equations describes the einstein - e sitter universe , i.e. the flat critical density friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) uniform density background .",
    "this solution is @xmath45 with @xmath46 the space - time interval is @xmath47 this is brought to a standard form @xmath48 using the transformation @xmath49      in order to describe deviations from the isotropic frw background , we follow cy90 and introduce @xmath50 and @xmath51 according to is equal to @xmath3 times the function used by cy90 . ] @xmath52 from the definition of @xmath53 in ( [ eq : def ] ) , we get @xmath54 . thus , to linear order @xmath55 can be identified as the energy - density constrast @xmath56 .",
    "the equations ( [ eq : phys1 ] ) through ( [ eq : phys4 ] ) , expressed in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath57 , are , @xmath58 @xmath59\\ ; , \\label{eq : com2}\\ ] ]    @xmath60e^{2b-(1+w)a}z^{2(1 + 3 w)/(3 + 3w)}\\ ; , \\ ] ]    @xmath61 ^ 2\\ ] ]    @xmath62 ^ 2e^{6b-2a}\\ ; , \\nonumber\\ ] ]    and @xmath63      linear perturbations describing small deviations from uniformity are obtained for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the linearized equations have two solutions .",
    "the first is ( cy90 ) @xmath66 where the constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 are related by @xmath69 expressed in terms of the frw coordinates @xmath70 and @xmath71 given in ( [ eq : transrt ] ) , we see that @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the energy - density contrast , @xmath56 , is @xmath73 , independent of @xmath3 , and has a temporal behavior identical to that obtained for large scale perturbations in the standard linear perturbation theory in the comoving gauge ( e.g. peebles 1993 ) .",
    "the second solution is @xmath74 according to ( [ eq : transrt ] ) , the limit @xmath75 corresponds to @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , density perturbations approaching zero as @xmath75 are described by @xmath80 for @xmath78 and @xmath81 for @xmath79 .",
    "the mode @xmath80 grows with time , while @xmath81 decays .",
    "we will consider solutions involving shock discontinuities propagating in a medium of cold pressure - less gas .",
    "we will assume that the heated matter behind the shock obeys the equation of state @xmath2 .",
    "a shock will be specified by the ratio of the energy - densities on both of its sides .",
    "the remaining hydrodynamical variables and the components of the metric on both sides of the shock are then related by means of the jump conditions .",
    "these are usually derived by working first with schwarzschild coordinates where the metric tensor is continuous and then transforming back to comoving coordinates ( bardeen 1965 ; cahil & taub 1971 ) .",
    "quantities just ahead and behind the shock are denoted by the @xmath82 and @xmath83 symbols , respectively .",
    "the general form of the jump conditions in comoving coordinates is ( cahil & taub 1971 ) , @xmath84 where @xmath85 the condition ( [ eq : r ] ) leads to the continuity of the self - similar variable @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 . using the relations @xmath88 we find that @xmath89 therefore , the condition ( [ eq : gamma ] ) relates between @xmath90 on both sides of the shock .",
    "we present here numerical solutions of the equations of motion for cases with and without shocks .",
    "the boundary conditions for all solutions obey the asymptotic form giving small density perturbations in the limit of large frw coordinate @xmath70 , corresponding to @xmath91 @xmath92 and to @xmath93 for @xmath4 .",
    "the case @xmath16 has been considered extensively by cy90 .",
    "therefore , we only present solutions for @xmath94 .",
    "an important difference between solutions with @xmath16 and @xmath95 is the following . for @xmath16 , a sonic point at which @xmath96 may exist . at this point",
    "the term @xmath97 in equation ( [ eq : com2 ] ) vanishes , leaving @xmath98 undetermined .",
    "certain physical assumptions must then be made in order to complete the solution across the sonic point ( e.g. ori & piran 1990 ; cy90 ) . for @xmath95 ,",
    "sonic points do not exist and , barring singularities , @xmath98 is always determined by ( [ eq : com2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dwp ] shows results of numerical integration of a positive density perturbation for @xmath99 ( solid lines ) , @xmath100 ( dotted ) , @xmath101 ( dashed ) , and @xmath102 ( dash - dotted ) . the four panels show , from top - left in clockwise order , the contrast in the energy - density ( i.e. @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the background energy density ) , the function @xmath105 , the  velocity \" @xmath106 , and the velocity @xmath107 of surfaces of constant @xmath108 relative to the fluid .",
    "solutions with @xmath78 diverge at a finite value of @xmath108 .",
    "this singular behavior of the solutions indicates the presence of black holes with apparent horizon at the point with @xmath109 and an event horizon at the point with @xmath110 ( carr & hawking 1974 ) .",
    "comoving coordinates should allow a description of the physical variables down to the singularity at the center .",
    "for the solutions with @xmath78 , the finite value of @xmath108 at which the solutions diverge represents the shell having a comoving coordinate @xmath7 and arriving at the center at time @xmath111 ( e.g. landau & lifshitz 1975 ) .",
    "the lines of @xmath112 follow the asymptotic form @xmath113 at @xmath114 for @xmath4 and @xmath115 at @xmath91 for @xmath78 . for @xmath4 , the limit @xmath116 is obtained by taking the limit @xmath75 or / and @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , the self - similar solution for @xmath102 describes a mode which decays with time and approaches zero at large frw coordinate @xmath70 , in contrast to the solutions shown for @xmath78 which grow with time . in the newtonian limit",
    "the quantity @xmath118 describes the velocity of a shell relative to a central observer . for @xmath78 , at sufficiently large @xmath108 , @xmath119 is positive . as we decrease @xmath108 , @xmath119 changes signs , indicating the collapse of matter towards the center .",
    "we discuss now solutions describing self - similar perturbations in the presence of shocks .",
    "the cosmic background is assumed to be made of cold pressure - less gas which is able to shock .",
    "we focus first on shocks propagating from the center of a perturbation with positive energy - density excess in the cold gas . at the end of this section we present solutions for shocks propagating into the uniform density background .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eq : com1 ] ) and ( [ eq : com2 ] ) with @xmath99 are integrated inward from @xmath120 with initial conditions dictated by the linear solution .",
    "the integration gives tabulated values for the variables @xmath121 and @xmath51 from @xmath122 until @xmath123 @xmath124 , where a shock is assumed to exist .",
    "given the variables @xmath125 and @xmath126 just a head of the shock at @xmath127 we obtain the corresponding physical variables @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "then , assuming a value for the ratio @xmath132 of the energy - densities behind and ahead of the shock , we use the jump conditions ( [ eq : r ] ) through ( [ eq : gamma ] ) to obtain @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 behind the shock .",
    "these variables are then used as initial conditions in the numerical integration of the equations ( [ eq : phys1 ] ) and ( [ eq : phys2 ] ) , from @xmath127 down to smaller values .",
    "this is done for several values @xmath137 and @xmath127 .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : vp ] ) implies that shocks can not exist at points with @xmath138 .",
    "this is related to that fact that @xmath110 marks an event horizon inner to which matter must eventually hit the central singularity ( carr & hawking 1974 ) .",
    "results of the numerical integrations are shown in figure ( [ fig : dsh ] ) .",
    "the top - left panel plots the energy - density ( in units of the baclground value ) , @xmath139 .",
    "the dashed line represents the solution obtained for the shock - less collapse of cold gas ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the solid lines show @xmath139 versus @xmath108 when shocks are assumed to exist at @xmath140 and @xmath141 . for these @xmath127 , the shock - less solution has @xmath142 ( the bottom panel to the left ) . for each value of @xmath127 ,",
    "lines representing solutions obtained for four values of @xmath132 are shown : @xmath143 , 2 , 3 , and 5 . at both @xmath127 ,",
    "the energy - density reaches a constant value as @xmath77 for the two larger values of @xmath137 and diverges at a finite @xmath108 for the smaller values .",
    "given @xmath137 , the jump conditions determine the pressure and energy - density ahead of the shock and , therefore , the ratio @xmath144 .",
    "the top - right panel plots lines of @xmath3 versus @xmath137 for three values of @xmath145 as indicates in the figure .",
    "the behavior of these lines can be easily understood by a straightforward algebraic manipulation of the jump condition ( [ eq : vp ] ) with @xmath146 . for @xmath137 close to unity",
    ", @xmath3 increases linearly with @xmath147 . in the limit @xmath148 we get @xmath149 so that @xmath150 which is independent of @xmath137 .",
    "curves of @xmath118 are shown in the bottom - left panel .",
    "the numeric labels on each line indicate the corresponding value of @xmath137 .",
    "it is interesting that for the regular solutions , @xmath118 converges to a positive constant as @xmath77 .",
    "this constant becomes smaller with decreasing @xmath127 and we conjecture that it will approach zero as @xmath127 gets very close to the event horizon marked by the point with @xmath110 in the dashed curve ( bottom panel to the left ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of this is that outflows / winds from a central region are required for the formation of shocks .",
    "the intensity of these outflows determine the location of the shock , @xmath127 .",
    "the bottom - right panel plots the velocity @xmath107 versus @xmath108 .",
    "the actual velocity is shown for the cold collapse ( dashed ) while the ratio @xmath151 is plotted for the other lines .",
    "for the regular solutions , @xmath151 is less then unity throughout the shocked regions .",
    "the other solutions have @xmath152 over the range from @xmath127 down to the finite @xmath108 marking the central singularity .",
    "thus , in both cases no sonic points exist .",
    "finally , the asymptotic behavior of the numerical solutions near the center is consistent with the analysis of cc02 . for the regular solutions",
    ", we have @xmath153 as @xmath77 .",
    "the analysis of cc02 of this case gives @xmath154 and @xmath155 which according to ( [ eq : def ] ) implies @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "our solutions match this behavior extremely well .",
    "it is interesting to compare between the solutions for shocks propagating in a positive density perturbation and in the uniform background .",
    "these solutions are represened , respectively , in the top and bottom rows of in figure ( [ dif : duni ] ) .",
    "the positive density solutions are taken from the output of the integration used in figure ( [ fig : dsh ] ) but for shocks assumed to exist at two points outside the region with @xmath142 ( compare with figure ( [ fig : dsh ] ) .",
    "this means that the shock exist at a point where the cold fluid is expanding .",
    "physically this is possible if a central energy source is present . as is seen in the top panel to the right , solid curves with intermediate @xmath137 hit sonic points ( @xmath158 ) . at these points",
    "we stop the integration .",
    "larger values of @xmath137 yield regular solutions without sonic points . for smaller @xmath137",
    ", the velocity @xmath107 changes direction and tends to infinity , indicating the presence of a black hole .",
    "as @xmath127 is decreased , the solutions behave in a manner similar to what we have seen in figure ( [ fig : dsh ] ) . in the uniform background case",
    ", sonic points always exist for small @xmath137 and disappear for sufficiently large values .",
    "in the standard cosmological model , the universe on large scales is nearly uniform so that super - horizon perturbations are well described by the general relativistic theory of linear perturbations ( e.g. bardeen 1980 ) .",
    "however , in view of resent observational data , it seems that gr might be needed for a full study of perturbations on small scales where strictly speaking the linearized equations are invalid .",
    "these data suggest that the expansion of the universe is accelerating ( e.g. spergel et .",
    "al . 2003 ) .",
    "it is thought that this acceleration is driven by a _ dark - energy _ component which , in its simplest incarnation , is described in terms of a fluid with pressure @xmath0 related to the energy density , @xmath1 , by @xmath27 with @xmath159 at the present cosmic epoch .",
    "the continuity equation , @xmath160 implies that for @xmath161 the density is constant with time and , therefore , by lorentz invariance , the fluid must be homogeneous .",
    "more generally , dark energy is modeled in terms of a scalar field which , under certain conditions , could be represented as a fluid with @xmath3 varying with time .",
    "such a fluid is not ruled out by observations .",
    "if this is the case , inhomogeneities in the dark energy component could develop .",
    "since dark energy is inherently a relativistic entity , gr therefore should be invoked for a thorough treatment of small scale cosmological perturbations .",
    "seen in this perspective self - similar solutions might be relevant for the description of structure formation in the universe .",
    "however , the solutions are quite limited in their applicability in a realistic model for the growth of structure in the presence of dark energy . putting the subdominant baryonic matter aside",
    ", the problem of structure formation requires tracing the evolution of the gravitationally coupled system of collisionless dark matter and dark energy .",
    "our solutions do not take this coupling into account .",
    "it is unclear whether self - similar evolution of cosmological perturbations in a two fluid system is possible at all .",
    "further , we assume a strict equation of state of the form @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to an imaginary  sound \" speed , @xmath162 for @xmath95 , while a more realistic model for dark energy in terms of scalar fields leads in general to a non - imaginary sound speed .",
    "verertheless , because of the paucity of analytic solutions for time - dependent systems in gr , a treatment of systems with restricted symmetry is a worthwhile effort",
    ". analytic study of these systems could also be useful in testing and calibrating numerical techniques for solving the gr equations .",
