    "the extra - galactic @xmath0-ray sky is dominated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of agn can be described by two components , a low energy component from radio to x - rays and a high energy one from x - rays to very high energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "the low energy component can be attributed to synchrotron radiation in a relativistic jet while the high energy emission can be either inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of low - energy seed photons by the synchrotron emitting electrons or emission through a hadronic process .",
    "if the seed photons for the ic scattering are the synchrotron photons , the process is called synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the seed photons can be external to the jet , for example , from the broad line region or the molecular torus , in which case the process is called external compton ( ec ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a recent study of the sed modelling of agn , see @xcite .",
    "if an agn is viewed with its jet very close to the line of sight , it is called a blazar .",
    "blazars emit brightly over the entire electromagnetic spectrum , and can be further divided based on their optical classification into flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl  lac objects .",
    "the optical emission of bl  lac objects is dominated by a strong continuum and they show only weak emission lines .",
    "fsrqs have strong emission lines and are thought to have a much denser environment near the black hole .",
    "the two classes also differ in their large - scale jet properties .",
    "fsrqs are thought to be the beamed counterparts of fanaroff - riley type ii ( fr  ii ) galaxies , which have more powerful jets than the fanaroff - riley type i ( fr  i ) galaxies , thought to be the unbeamed counterpart of bl  lac objects @xcite .",
    "however , some recent studies have shown that the division of fsrqs and bl  lacs into fr i and fr  ii galaxies does not always follow this trend ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "early studies using the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) @xmath0-ray instrument showed that high states in the optical and @xmath0 rays are connected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but detailed comparisons were hindered by the poor sampling of the light curves .",
    "the tendency for simultaneous flaring has been confirmed since the launch of the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( hereafter , _ fermi _ ) in 2008 and the capability of its large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite to detect agn even in their non - flaring states .",
    "many individual sources studied in great detail have shown correlated flares in optical and @xmath0-ray spectral regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while individual sources have been studied in detail , the number of studies including multiple sources is limited .",
    "@xcite studied the 6 best sampled blazars observed within the smarts blazar monitoring program and found short delays between the optical and @xmath0-ray flares . by decomposing the optical and @xmath0-ray light curves in to individual flares they also found the shapes of the flares to be similar in the two bands",
    "however , @xcite studied 12 sources in the same program and found that in some sources the variations were correlated while in others they were not .",
    "a statistical approach was taken by @xcite who studied 80 lat - detected objects in the mojave sample . using non - simultaneous optical data",
    ", they found the optical and @xmath0-ray luminosities to be correlated in the fsrqs in their sample , while no significant correlation was found for bl  lac objects .",
    "the dispersion in the optical to @xmath0-ray luminosity correlation was also much larger than for radio and @xmath0-ray luminosities .",
    "they attributed this to the possible larger variability in the optical compared to radio , which would increase the scatter in non - simultaneous correlations .",
    "we use the data for 714 agn in the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) @xcite and 1244 agn in the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ) @xcite to study the connection between the optical and @xmath0-ray emission in a _ population _ of agn .",
    "the data sets have 637 sources in common .",
    "we use the intrinsic modulation index @xcite to study differences between sub - populations of sources and the significance estimation method of @xcite to evaluate the flux  flux correlation between the optical and @xmath0-ray data .",

    "[ sect : data ] we describe our sample selection and data reduction .",

    "we use the agn sample defined by @xcite and monitored by them at 15ghz at the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) 40-m as the starting point for our analysis .",
    "this sample of 1771 objects includes 1158 sources from the candidate gamma - ray blazar survey ( cgrabs ) @xcite and all the sources above declination @xmath1 that have been detected by the lat in the first and second agn catalogs @xcite .",
    "the ovro sample also includes a small number of objects with interesting jet properties or that are being monitored by other programs .",
    "the cgrabs sample is a statistically well - defined sample that was selected to resemble blazars that were detected by egret .",
    "the sources were selected from a flat - spectrum parent sample that is complete to 65mjy flux density at 4.8ghz and have radio spectral index ] @xmath2 . the cgrabs sources were then selected based on their radio spectral index , 8.4ghz flux density , and x - ray flux from _ rosat _ all sky survey .",
    "the sample was compiled before the launch of _ fermi _ and was expected to contain a large number of sources that would be detected by _",
    "fermi_. however , _ fermi _ is much more sensitive to hard @xmath0-ray spectrum sources than egret and a large number of cgrabs sources have not been detected by _",
    "fermi_. this makes the sample ideal for studying the differences between the _ fermi_-detected and non - detected objects .",
    "our ptf and crts samples contain 508 and 839 cgrabs sources , respectively .",
    "we emphasize that while our samples do not include all cgrabs sources , they are _ unbiased _ subsets of the complete sample as the sample selection was not done based on the optical or @xmath0-ray properties of the sources .",
    "we search for all the objects within @xmath3 of our sample targets in the ptf and @xmath4 in the crts .",
    "these limits were selected based on the pixel size and typical seeing of the observations .",
    "we describe the details of the data extraction and analysis for each survey individually below . to allow for comparison with simultaneous ovro and",
    "_ fermi _ observations , we use data from 2008 to 2013 .",
    "the redshifts for the sources in our sample range from 0.04 to 3.9 with a median of 1 . for the population studies we divide our final samples into @xmath0-ray loud and quiet objects based on their lat detection .",
    "we use only the sources in the clean samples of the 1st and 2nd lat agn catalogs @xcite .",
    "these are sources for which only a single association has been determined in the _ fermi _ catalogs .    additionally , we study the differences between the fsrq and bl  lac objects .",
    "the classifications we use come mainly from the cgrabs and _ fermi _ catalogs .",
    "furthermore , we divide the sources based on the frequency of their synchrotron peak @xmath5 into low synchrotron peaked ( lsp ) , intermediate synchrotron peaked ( isp ) and high synchrotron peak ( hsp ) objects .",
    "we use the classifications from the 2nd lat agn catalog where the lsp sources have @xmath6  hz , isps have @xmath7 and hsps have @xmath8  hz @xcite .",
