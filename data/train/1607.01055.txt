    "sn  1987a was the nearest supernova ( sn ) in modern times .",
    "two surprising observations associated with sn  1987a ( see review by @xcite ) were the identification of a blue supergiant ( bsg ) progenitor in pre - explosion images @xcite and its very unusual triple - ring circumstellar nebula @xcite .",
    "these two are intimately related , since the geometry of the nebula bears the imprint of mass loss shaped by binary interaction and/or rapid rotation as the star evolved to its blue pre - sn state .",
    "the dynamical age of the nebula is only @xmath1120,000 yr @xcite , so the nebular structures trace recent pre - sn mass loss on a time scale much shorter than core he burning and longer than c burning .",
    "the total mass of the ring is uncertain ( due to an uncertain neutral fraction ) , but may be 0.1 - 1 @xmath2 @xcite . an important unresolved question is whether or not close binary evolution was key in determining the progenitor s bsg state ( mass transfer or merger , mass loss , etc . ) .",
    "the ring nebula may therefore provide important clues to how and why the progenitor came to be a bsg .",
    "understanding the origin of the observed triple - ring structure has been difficult , however .",
    "several early models showed that a faster bsg wind expanding into a previous slower red supergiant ( rsg ) wind with an equatorial density enhancement could yield an equatorial ring and bipolar structure @xcite .",
    "however , the pair of polar rings around sn  1987a really are empty rings , rather than limb - brightened polar lobes or filled caps , and their origin has not been satisfactorally explained .",
    "it is difficult to understand the origin of the equatorial density enhancement in a rsg wind without invoking a binary @xcite . in subsequent studies ,",
    "two different types of models have been proposed as plausible ways to form the nebula .",
    "a scenario involving a binary merger as a rsg and subsequent blueward evolution was proposed @xcite , and was suggested to account for the observed nebular structure . however , this specific merger model predicts filled polar caps and relatively empty mid - latitudes in the nebula , whereas the observed nebula has no polar caps and may have some emission in the side walls of an hourglass structure .",
    "moreover , the model requires that the merger product should be rotating very rapidly , which seems to be at odds with galactic analogs ( see below ) .",
    "a somewhat different model involves rotating single - star evolution , where a massive star spins up as it contracts on a post - rsg blue loop , nearly reaching critical rotation and ejecting a ring @xcite .",
    "then a bipolar wind from the rotating bsg expands into the rsg wind and ring , forming transient structures that may resemble the rings of sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "however , this model also requires a rapidly rotating bsg , inconsistent with observations of galactic analogs . in either case",
    "the strength of the bsg wind is a critical ingredient .",
    "radio observations of sn  1987a ( or rather , the lack of radio emission at early times ) suggested that for the first 1000 - 1500 days after explosion , the blast wave was expanding relatively unimpeded through a very low - density wind @xcite .",
    "after about 1500 days , however , the radio emission brightened and the expansion speed slowed to only 3500 km s@xmath3 @xcite . in order to reach the angular scale of the resolved radio emission when it turned on",
    ", the blast wave must have been expanding at about 35,000 km s@xmath3 for those first 1500 days @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that after the initial free expansion through a rarefied wind with @xmath12=7.5@xmath810@xmath13 yr@xmath3 or less , the blast wave slammed into a dense h  ii region that partly filled the ring s interior . in this model , the dense h  ii region",
    "was created by photoionization of the rsg wind by the bsg s uv radiation .",
    "this collision slowed the forward shock s expansion and caused the radio emission to brighten dramatically @xcite .",
    "since the progenitor star sk@xmath1469@xmath15202 is now dead , it is hard to improve our understanding of the connection between the star and its nebula .",
    "for this reason , nearby analogs of sn  1987a s progenitor  where the bsg has not yet exploded  become interesting and valuable .",
    "there are currently three well - studied analogs known in our galaxy : ( 1 ) sher  25 @xcite , which is significantly more luminous and has partial polar caps instead of rings , ( 2 ) hd  168625 @xcite , which is a more luminous lbv candidate that does have polar rings , and ( 3 ) sbw1 @xcite ( discussed below ) .",
    "an interesting recent result places important constraints on the formation of these rings : @xcite monitored the central stars of all three galactic analogs with high - resolution spectroscopy and did not find any radial velocity variations consistent with close massive binaries ( the value of sin @xmath16 is presumed from the resolved equatorial rings ; if a binary system s orbit were significantly misaligned with these rings , then binary interation would not help to explain them ) .",
    "perhaps even more interesing , @xcite found that all three bsg central stars have relatively _ slow rotation speeds_. for sbw1 , the rotation speed is only about 40 km s@xmath3 .",
    "such slow rotation may be quite problematic for some merger models that would predict a rapidly rotating bsg post - merger product  especially if the stellar wind in the bsg phase is very weak .",
    "we will return to this issue later in the paper .    of these three galactic analogs",
    ", sbw1 is currently the best known analog to sn  1987a in terms of stellar properties and nebular structure .",
    "the ring around sbw1 was discovered by @xcite during a survey of the carina nebula , but two factors suggest that it is actually located several kpc _ behind _ the carina nebula and is seen there in projection .",
    "first , its positive radial velocity compared to expectations for galactic rotation in that direction suggest that it is on the far side of the sagittarius - carina arm and outside the solar circle .",
    "second , its apparent magnitude and color only match its spectral type and luminosity class ( b1.5 iab ; @xcite ) if it is at a much larger distance than the carina nebula . at a distance of 6 - 7",
    "kpc , the stellar luminosity ( 0.51@xmath810@xmath17 @xmath10 ) as well as the size of the ring nebula ( @xmath18 pc ) make sbw1 a close match for sn  1987a",
    ".    detailed analysis of the sbw1 nebula has provided interesting clues that may alter our ideas about the formation of the nebula around sn  1987a .",
    "_ hst _ images of sbw1 @xcite show a pattern of clumps around the ring and a radial extent that closely resemble the spacing and size scale of spots in the ring of sn  1987a .",
    "the interior of the ring is filled with diffuse h@xmath0 emission , although the ring would probably appear much brighter relative to the interior if it were flash ionized by a sn @xcite .",
    "a very interesting result is that high - resolution ground - based infrared ( ir ) images show that the interior of the ring is also partly filled with diffuse emission from warm dust . since bsgs",
    "do nt produce dust in their winds , this requires that the dust inside the ring was entrained from the ring itself .",
    "@xcite proposed that this structure arises because the inner surface of the dense and neutral equatorial ring is ionized by the central star , and that this triggers a dusty ionized photoevaporative flow that fills the interior of the ring .",
    "the ionized gas expands into the ring until it collides with the stellar wind ; entrained dust piles up at this interface , producing the observed peaks of thermal - ir emission inside the ring @xcite .",
    "this simple ionized flow is able to dramatically influence the observed structure and dynamics of the nebula because the ring s expansion is slow ( 10 - 20 km s@xmath3 ) , comparable to the sound speed of the ionized gas .",
    "this directly imaged structure around sbw1 appears to validate the picture of an h  ii region inside the ring of sn  1987a proposed by @xcite , which was deduced from the time evolution of the sn s radio emission . in this scenario ,",
    "the main requirement is that the star ejected a thin , dense ring about 10@xmath9 yr ago . while this might have occurred in post - rsg evolution to the blue ( perhaps with a merger ) , a ring might also be ejected in a brief mass - transfer episode of a close binary or in an eruptive mass loss event from a rotating star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a previous rsg phase is not necessarily required @xcite .                in order to test whether this proposed scenario actually works for the specific case of sbw1 , we need to know the mass - loss rate of the wind from the central star , because this was an assumed parameter in our previous analysis @xcite . for this reason",
    ", we proposed to obtain uv spectra of the central star .",
    "optical spectra are useful for constraining atmosphere / wind models as well , but the uv resonance lines are usually the most sensitive probes of the wind density and speed .",
    "our new observations are discussed in  2 , our analysis of the data including a comparison with radiative transfer models is presented in  3 , and a discussion of the results and implications is given in  4 .",
    "in cycle 20 ( program go-12924 ) , we used the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) to observe the uv spectrum of the bsg star at the center of the sbw1 ring nebula .",
    "we used fuv mode in the g160 m grating with central wavelengths of 1577 and 1600  .",
    "these two grating tilts were combined to fill the gap between the microchannel plate detector segments .",
    "the cos observations were taken on 2013 march 24 .",
    "the resulting spectral coverage was 1384@xmath141777  , with a spectral resolving power @xmath19 of 16,000@xmath1418,000 ( 17@xmath1419 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "across most of the spectrum the total exposure time was 11.5 ksec , although at the edges and middle of the wavelength range ( corresponding to the cos detector gap that was filled ) the effective exposure time dropped as low as @xmath114 ksec .",
    "the regions with this lower signal - to - noise ratio did not include important diagnostic lines like si  iv and c  iv discussed below .    in our analysis",
    "below , we also include a normalized visible - wavelength spectrum of the central star .",
    "the spectrum was obtained in 2006 with rc spec on the ctio 4 m telescope , and covers roughly 3000@xmath146000   with a spectral resolving power @xmath19=@xmath20/@xmath21 of about 500 .",
    "this spectrum has already been published , and the associated details of the data reduction were already presented by @xcite . in order to help constrain the value of the effective gravity from the wings of balmer lines , we also compare models to a high - resolution echelle spectrum of sbw1 s h@xmath0 line published previously @xcite .",
    "we use the radiative transfer code cmfgen @xcite to analyze the optical and ultraviolet spectrum of sbw1 .",
    "cmfgen self - consistently solves the radiative transfer in a stellar atmosphere and spherically - symmetric , stationary wind .",
    "line and continuum formation are calculated in the non - lte regime .",
    "each model is defined by the effective temperature @xmath22  ( evaluated at a rosseland optical depth of 2/3 ) , luminosity @xmath23 , effective gravity @xmath24 , mass - loss rate @xmath12 , wind terminal velocity @xmath25 , velocity law , and chemical abundances .",
    "cmfgen accounts for line blanketing , and we include the appropriate ionization stages of h , he , c , n , o , si , mg , al , fe , and ni in the analysis of sbw1 , with an atomic model similar to that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "cmfgen uses an ad - hoc velocity law as input that is typically parameterized by a beta - type law , which is modified to smoothly match a hydrostatic structure at high optical depths . here",
    "we assume @xmath26=1.5 .",
    "we do not include the effects of clumping .",
    "we refer the reader to these aforementioned papers and @xcite for further details on cmfgen .",
    "we employed standard spectroscopic criteria @xcite for determining the stellar and wind parameters of sbw1 .",
    "table  [ params ] presents the inferred stellar and wind parameters , while figs .",
    "[ modeloptical ] and [ modeluv ] display the best fit cmfgen model compared to the observations of sbw1 in the optical and ultraviolet , respectively .",
    "we find @xmath27 cm s@xmath28 based on the wings of h@xmath29 and h@xmath30 in the low - resolution spectrum .",
    "comparing to the wings of h@xmath0 in an echelle spectrum gives a somewhat higher value of 2.7 to 3.0 cm s@xmath28 for @xmath31 .",
    "our models indicate @xmath32 based on the ionization balance of si , using the relative strengths of si@xmath33iv @xmath34 , si@xmath33iii @xmath35 , and si@xmath33ii @xmath36 .",
    "the effective temperature is further supported by the he and fe ionization balances , using he@xmath33ii@xmath37 in the ultraviolet and optical he@xmath33i line triplets ( since singlets are model dependent ; @xcite ) , and ultraviolet fe@xmath33iii and fe@xmath33iv lines .",
    "the luminosity of sbw1 is more difficult to constrain because the distance and reddening are uncertain . with the cmfgen model ,",
    "we can constrain it using the observed @xmath38 and @xmath19 magnitudes @xcite , and the flux - calibrated cos spectrum in the uv , combined with an assumed distance .",
    "we compare the observed spectral energy distribution with cmfgen models computed with different luminosities , and reddened using the parameterization from @xcite . the distance",
    "to sbw1 is uncertain , derived previously from its radial velocity as @xmath117  kpc @xcite .",
    "we find a bolometric luminosity of @xmath39 ( d / 7 kpc)@xmath40 and a color excess of @xmath41=0.95 mag , assuming a selective - to - total extinction parameter of @xmath42 .",
    "then again , a value of @xmath43 has been determined for clouds within the carina nebula @xcite , through which sbw1 is seen , and this extinction law would raise the luminosity .",
    "if we add @xmath44 photometry from @xcite , we could not find a single extinction law that would fit all the data .",
    "since sbw1 is seen through carina , it may be that the line - of - sight extinction has multiple components from the carina nebula ( @xmath43 ) and from the normal ism ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "if we allow @xmath45 to be a free parameter and focus on the optical and ir photometry , we find a best fit for @xmath41=0.98 mag and @xmath45=3.8 .",
    "for these , we find a higher luminosity of ( 5 - 6.5)@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath46 .",
    "the luminosity and mass of the star are discussed further in section 4.1 .    using the relative strength of optical he@xmath33i to h lines",
    ", our cmfgen analysis indicates that the he abundance of sbw1 is around solar , with he / h=0.1 ( by number ) .",
    "we use c@xmath33ii @xmath47 as diagnostic for the c abundance , o@xmath33ii @xmath48 for o , and n@xmath33ii @xmath49 for n. we find @xmath50=7.84 , @xmath51=8.13 , and @xmath52=8.30 , implying that n is enriched in comparison to c and o. the abundances of sbw1 are within the range of typical values inferred for bsgs by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the observed spectrum of sbw1 does not show any clear signature of wind emission in the ultraviolet and optical regions , which suggests a very low value of @xmath12 .",
    "we computed cmfgen models with @xmath12  values between @xmath53 yr@xmath3 .",
    "while h@xmath0 is contaminated by nebular emission , significant emission would still be detectable for @xmath54 yr@xmath3 , and wind signatures could possibly be detected down to @xmath55 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the ultraviolet resonance lines provide more stringent constraints on @xmath12 .",
    "even a model with @xmath56 yr@xmath3 still shows significant si@xmath33iv  @xmath57 emission , which is not detected in the observed spectrum ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ modeluv ] ) .",
    "interestingly , a cmfgen plane - parallel model ( i.e. no wind , just photospheric emission ) provides a better match to the observed uv spectrum of the s  iv lines ( see fig .",
    "[ modeluv ] ) . as such",
    ", cmfgen models suggest that the mass - loss rate of sbw1 is less than @xmath56 yr@xmath3 . any possible optically - thin wind clumping ( which we have not included ) would lower this estimate even more . as we discuss below , however , there are reasons to suspect that some of the approximations in cmfgen may no longer be appropriate much below 10@xmath4 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 , due to the balance of heating and cooling ( and its influence on the ionization level ) .",
    "we therefore adopt this latter value as a conservative upper limit in our analysis .",
    "because wind signatures are not detected , we can not place constraints on the wind terminal velocity of sbw1 s wind . the models analyzed here",
    "assume @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "to further investigate the low value of @xmath12  for sbw1 , we inspected publicly available _ iue _ ultraviolet spectra of bsgs .",
    "figure [ uvcomparehd ] compares the uv spectrum of sbw1 to that of hd  13854 , which is a b1  iab supergiant star @xcite .",
    "one can clearly see that despite having a very similar photospheric spectrum , the si@xmath33iv and c@xmath33iv lines have p cyg profiles and are much stronger in hd  13854 , indicating a significantly stronger wind than in sbw1 .",
    "indeed , @xcite estimated a mass - loss rate of @xmath60 yr@xmath3 for hd  13854 , which is several orders of magnitude larger than for sbw1 , and consistent with expectations .",
    "this difference may be related to the significantly different luminosities of these two bsgs ( 3.4@xmath810@xmath61 for hd  13854 ) , which would cause different mass - loss rates due to the difference in radiative flux .",
    "even so , it is puzzling that sbw1 s wind is so weak .",
    ".stellar and wind parameters of sbw1 derived with cmfgen .",
    "some values have a range because of distance uncertainties .",
    "as discussed in the text , consistency favors values of @xmath62 , log @xmath63 = 47.44 s@xmath3 , and log @xmath64 = 3.0 . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     note : although this mass - loss rate of 10@xmath1 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 appears to be a reasonable upper limit resulting from the cmfgen model , in the text we discuss why a higher upper limit of 10@xmath4 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 is probably more important , due to a possible lack of cooling in the wind .",
    "our cmfgen analysis confirms many of the physical paramaters that had been inferred previously from photometry and spectral type .",
    "the value of @xmath65 = 21,000  k that we derive from the cmfgen model is the same as assumed previously from the b1.5  iab spectral type and spectral energy distribution @xcite .",
    "the luminosity derived previously from the sed was uncertain ( 0.5 - 1)@xmath810@xmath17 @xmath46 .",
    "our cmfgen model gives a somewhat lower value of 2.5@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath46 @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the distance relative to our assumed value of 7 kpc .",
    "as noted earlier , however , the true luminosity would be raised to ( 5 - 6.5)@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10 if we adopted a larger value of @xmath45 , as may be appropriate .",
    "below , we also find that the likely distance is larger than 7 kpc .",
    "interestingly , with the weak wind of sbw1 , we can use the effective gravity @xmath68 from the model to place constraints on both the true luminosity and present - day mass if we assume that the spectroscopically derived mass @xmath69 is comparable to the evolutionary mass @xmath70 . @xcite have discussed this in detail , and concluded that @xmath69 is usually a reliable representation of the true stellar mass as long as the star is not close to the eddington limit ( i.e. for moderately massive and intermediate - mass stars ) . since sbw1 has no detectable signatures of a wind , we surmize that it is nowhere near its eddington limit .",
    "our model derived from a comparison to low - resolution spectra gave log @xmath68=2.6 ( table 1 ) .",
    "however , by comparing cmfgen models to higher resolution spectra of balmer lines , as shown in figure  [ halpha ] , we favor a somewhat higher value of 2.7 - 3.0 for log @xmath68 .",
    "this difference arizes because the lower - resolution spectra are compromised by nebular emission that affects the line profiles , whereas the stellar balmer line wing shapes are resolved in the echelle spectrum . from the definition of @xmath71",
    "we can write    @xmath72    where @xmath69 is the present - day spectroscopically derived stellar mass , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the star s photospheric radius and bolometric luminosity , respectively , @xmath75 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "we note that the uncertainty is dominated by errors in @xmath68 rather than errors in @xmath5 . inserting fiducial values of @xmath5 = 21,000 k , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( @xmath67)@xmath40 , where @xmath67 is the adopted distance relative to 7 kpc , we then have    @xmath78    for the _ present - day _ stellar mass as indicated by the effective gravity .",
    "we can then attempt to constrain the actual luminosity and mass of sbw1 by seeing what combinations of @xmath79 , @xmath74 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 give values consistent with evolutionary models .",
    "figure  [ hrd ] shows a hertzsprung - russel ( hr ) diagram comparing the inferred luminosity of sbw1 to single - star evolutionary tracks @xcite , for reference .",
    "this comparison shows that the lower luminosity for an assumed distance of 7 kpc , combined with the @xmath68 indicated by the spectrum , gives a stellar mass of @xmath117 @xmath2  but this is much lower than one expects in this region of the hr diagram . for a slightly larger distance of 9.9 kpc , however , the luminosity and @xmath80 rise by a factor of two , and importantly , are then in very good agreement with the expected luminosity for a 14 - 15 @xmath2 evolved star .",
    "in fact , the @xmath5 and @xmath74 we derive would agree very well with the hook in the evolutionary track for a 14 @xmath2 star that occurs after core h exhaustion , which would seem to make sense with the blue supergiant spectral type .",
    "of course , the comparison to single - star evolutionary tracks may be misleading if sbw1 is the result of binary evolution that may alter its @xmath81/@xmath82 ratio ; one could argue that it would be appropriate to compare sbw1 s spectroscopic mass to models for a merger product or mass gainer .",
    "such a comparison might favor a slightly different combination of @xmath79 , @xmath68 , @xmath74 , and @xmath83 , especially if these values evolve in the @xmath1110@xmath9 yr after a merger or mass transfer episode .",
    "we could , of course , also achieve a luminosity of 5@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10 with a smaller distance ( 8 kpc , say ) and a slightly higher @xmath45 value .",
    "the luminosity is unlikely to be much lower than 2.5@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath46 , however , due to the fact that the optical spectrum has a supergiant luminosity class , and that the implied mass from @xmath68 would be too low for the corresponding @xmath81 .",
    "based on this comparison , we therefore favor values of log @xmath68=3.0 cm s@xmath28 and @xmath74 = 5@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10 for sbw1 .    altogether , these parameters make the central star of sbw1 only a little hotter than sk@xmath1469@xmath15202 , and about 50% of its bolometric luminosity .",
    "it has an effective initial mass of around 14  @xmath84 , as compared to 18  @xmath84 for sk@xmath1469@xmath15202 @xcite . from @xmath85 ,",
    "the implied stellar radius is of order 15 - 20 @xmath86 , and so the surface escape velocity is about the same as for the sun or slightly lower .",
    "the chemical abundances we derive from the photospheric spectrum show basically solar composition , except for an enhanced n abundance that is elevated by a factor of 3 or 8 compared to solar n / o or n / c ratios , respectively .",
    "this , too , is quite similar to the enhanced n abundances inferred from the emission - line spectrum of the ring around sn  1987a , and is indicative of significant cno processing present at the star s surface .",
    "will the central star of sbw1 be the next galactic sn ?",
    "the dynamical age of the nebula is about 10@xmath9 yr , similar to sn  1987a , so perhaps it is a good candidate .",
    "of course , the uncertainty of such a clock is huge . aside from the nebular age and an analogy to sn  1987a",
    ", we have little from which to infer the time until the impending core collapse .",
    "the most significant observational result from our cos spectrum is the lack of any strong wind features in the spectrum , which is very unusual for a blue supergiant . consequently , the most interesting result from our quantitative cmfgen analysis is the astonishingly low derived mass - loss rate of sbw1 .",
    "comparing our lowest mass - loss rate cmfgen models ( which still show some evidence of wind emission ) to the observations , which show none , implies and upper limit of @xmath87  @xmath84 yr@xmath3 for an assumed terminal wind speed of 300 @xmath88 .",
    "however , this assumes that the uv resonance lines are modeled correctly at such low wind densities .",
    "a cautionary remark relates to the so - called `` weak - wind problem '' ( see @xcite for a review ) , where uv - diagnostics of late - type o dwarfs yield mass - loss rates that are 100 times lower than expected from the vink et al .",
    "recipe and from h@xmath0 diagnostics .",
    "the cautionary comment is that an independent method of deriving the mass - loss rate based on the structure of a bow shock around @xmath89  oph gives a mass - loss rate estimate that is @xmath1110 times higher than uv diagnostics , but still an order of magnitude lower than expected from standard mass - loss prescriptions @xcite .",
    "thus , there are some indications that the weak - wind problem for late o dwarfs is perhaps not as severe as indicated by uv estimates .",
    "thus , when mass - loss rates are low , cmfgen and similar models might underestimate the mass - loss rate somewhat based on uv diagnostics . this may be caused by inefficient cooling at low wind densities , so that shocks within the wind keep the ionization level higher than expected @xcite .",
    "does some version of this weak wind problem translate to bsg winds such as the case of sbw1 ?",
    "figure  [ flow ] shows how the flow timescale in the wind compares to the cooling timescale for some representative assumed values of the mass - loss rate and the collision speed @xmath90 of internal shocks in the wind .",
    "the temperature and ionization balance of the wind depends on heating by shocks within the flow , and cooling , which depends on the density .",
    "if the cooling timescale becomes long at low densities , the wind may expand before it can cool , and so the ionization in the inner wind may be higher than in a cmfgen model .",
    "typical wind speeds for an early b supergiant would be around 500 km s@xmath3 , and we would expect shocks within the clumpy outflowing wind to be some fraction of that  perhaps 100 - 200 km s@xmath3 and almost certainly less than 300 km s@xmath3 ( a caveat is that we ca nt be certain about the value of the wind speed , since we do nt actually detect any wind absorption ; thus , it remains possible that sbw1 s wind might be faster than typical winds for b1.5 supergiants , which might raise the allowed mass - loss rate )",
    ". therefore , in figure  [ flow ] we should expect sbw1 s wind to reside somewhere above the green dashed line and below the blue dash - dotted line ( for @xmath90=100 and 300 km s@xmath3 , respectively ) . for an intermediate shock speed",
    "around 200 km s@xmath3 , for example , a mass - loss rate below 10@xmath4 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 would make the cooling timescale and the flow timescale about the same in the inner wind ( a few stellar radii ) .",
    "this means that below 10@xmath4 @xmath84 yr@xmath3 , the bulk of the wind might remain hotter than in the cmfgen model , and would be harder to observe in the typical uv diagnostic lines that we are referrring to .",
    "thus , if the mass - loss rate drops much below 10@xmath4 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 , we can not be confident that cmfgen is properly treating the relevant physics , whereas above this , we should begin to see some evidence of a wind in the uv lines .",
    "we adopt 10@xmath4 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 as a fairly conservative upper limit to the mass - loss rate of sbw1 , rather than 10@xmath1 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 , due to this uncertain treatment of the cooling and ionization balance in cmfgen at such low mass - loss rates .    our hypothesis that the wind of sbw1 has too low a density to cool  and therefore remains hot  can be tested .",
    "this hypothesis would predict detectable x - ray , euv , and possibly fuv emission signatures from the wind , which may be verified with future observations .",
    "an observational determination of @xmath91 with future x - ray observations would thus help provide a direct constraint on the mass - loss rate of sbw1 and the amount of shock heating within the wind . at the stellar temperatures appropriate for sbw1 s spectral type",
    ", cmfgen does not predict any n  v or o  vi features , but cmfgen s reatment of the wind is not appropriate if the wind remains hot as we suspect .",
    "if low density inhibits cooling , we can make a qualitative prediction that n  v and o  vi may be observed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but a more detailed model beyond cmfgen s current capabilities would be needed to derive a specific line strength for a quantitative mass - loss rate .",
    "even this revised upper limit to the mass - loss rate of 10@xmath4 is much lower than one would expect for this star .",
    "for example , from the mass - loss prescriptions given by @xcite , we would expect @xmath12 = 1.2@xmath810@xmath92 @xmath84 yr@xmath3 for @xmath93 , for line - driven winds at the appropriate @xmath65 of sbw1 ( note that 21,000 k places this on the cool side of the bistability jump ) .",
    "our observationally derived upper limit to the mass - loss rate for sbw1 is more than 10 times lower than this expected value , even with no reduction in the observed value to correct for clumping .    why is the wind of sbw1 so weak as compared to expectations , and as compared to other observed bsgs ?",
    "the solution to this puzzle may hold important clues related to the origin of the ring nebula and the star s evolutionary history , and perhaps also for extragalactic sne that appear similar to sn  1987a .    for sn  1987a , the physical properties of the pre - sn stellar wind were uncertain , but some considerations also pointed to an anomalously low mass - loss rate compared to other bsgs . on the one hand , models derived from interpreting the early radio observations in the context of free - free self absorption of the sn radio emission by the freely expanding wind yielded a relatively high mass - loss rate of order 3.56 @xmath8 10@xmath94 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 with @xmath95=550 km s@xmath3 @xcite . on the other hand , hydrodynamic interacting - winds models used to explain the formation of the nebula required much weaker bsg winds in order to reproduce the slow expansion speed of the equatorial ring @xcite . to keep the ring expanding at the slow observed value of @xmath1110 km s@xmath3",
    ", these models would require upper limits to the mass - loss rate and wind speed of @xmath96 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 and @xmath97 km s@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite suggested that this discrepancy might be explained if the star s mass - loss rate increased in the last decades or century leading up to the moment of explosion , but @xcite suggested that synchrotron self - absorption , rather than free - free self absorption by the wind , might explain the early radio observations .    further indication that the progenitor star s mass - loss rate was low compared to normal bsgs came from the rebrightening in the radio at @xmath111500 days after the sn @xcite .",
    "this rebrightening was attributed to the collision between the fast sn ejecta and an h  ii region from the photoionized rsg wind , as noted in the introduction @xcite .",
    "assuming that the interior region was filled with a relatively low - density freely expanding bsg wind , @xcite showed that this collision could occur at the observationally inferred radius of @xmath110.1 pc with a model that adopted @xmath98 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 and @xmath99 km s@xmath3 .",
    "later models refined this value , in some cases including constraints from the evolution of x - ray emission , to even lower values of around 5@xmath810@xmath100 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 or less @xcite .",
    "this is a very low mass - loss rate for a bsg star of @xmath1110@xmath17 @xmath10 . according to the standard recipie for hot star mass - loss rates usually used in evolutionary codes @xcite , a star with log(@xmath101)=5 , @xmath5=21,000  k , and @xmath82=18 @xmath2 should have a mass - loss rate of 4.8@xmath810@xmath92 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 at lmc metallicity .",
    "the mass - loss rate inferred for the progenitor of sn  1987a based on the expansion of the blast wave is at least 6 and as much as 100 times lower than this expected value .",
    "this appears very similar to the case of sbw1 outlined above .",
    "thus , both the progenitor of sn  1987a and sbw1 seem to share the pecularity that they have bsg winds that are extremely weak compared to the expected wind strength for their stellar parameters .",
    "this is not the case for the other two well - studied galactic analogs with ring nebulae ; both sher  25 and hd  168625 have strong h@xmath0 wind emission and have mass - loss rates that are normal ( sher  25 ) or strong ( hd  168625 ) compared to other bsgs @xcite .",
    "although accounting for clumping has been argued to require a reduction to mass - loss rate recipies by factors of 3 - 5 ( see @xcite for a review ) , the deficits for sn  1987a and sbw1 are greater than this ( and again , we did not include a clumping correction for sbw1 ) .    in models that aim to explain the formation of sn  1987a s triple ring nebula with a merger @xcite , bsg mass - loss rates of ( 1 - 2 ) @xmath8 10@xmath92 @xmath2 yr@xmath3",
    "are adopted to shape the ring nebula ( e.g. , table 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite adopted this same value for the mass - loss rate in their simulations of the sn interaction with the csm , although they did not explore the impact of other assumed values for the mass - loss rate .",
    "these are higher than the observationally inferred values for sn  1987a ( from the time history of radio emission , as noted above ) and for sbw1 .",
    "it is therefore unclear if interacting stellar winds can provide a viable physical explanation for the shaping of the nebulae around sn  1987a and sbw1 .",
    "the issue of pressure balance is discussed more below .",
    "previous studies have discussed the formation of bipolar and ring nebulae , like the ones around sn  1987a and sbw1 , in the context of interacting winds where a fast bsg wind expands into a slower and asymmetric rsg wind with an equatorial density enhancement ( see the introduction ) . however , a somewhat different scenario was discussed wherein a fast bsg interacts with an h  ii region or photoevaporative flow for the specific cases of sn  1987a @xcite and sbw1 @xcite based on the inferred density structure inside the ring , which is inconsistent with a simple interacting winds scenario . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how the extreme weakness of the bsg wind from sbw1 requires further modification to the story .    in this scenario ,",
    "the location of the shock between the bsg wind and the ionized photoevaporative flow is determined by the mass - loss rate and speed of the wind from the central star , balanced by the pressure of the photoevaporative flow .",
    "specifically , ram pressure of the stellar wind @xmath102 is balanced by the thermal pressure of the ionized gas inside the ring nebula . the photoevaporation rate of the ring that is the source of gas and dust in the h  ii region depends on geometry and the ionizing photon flux of the star , @xmath63 , which is given in table 1 . however , in this case we can avoid the uncertainty introduced by the detailed geometry of the ring ( clump size , ring height , whether gas in the walls of an hourglass contributes , etc . ) because spectral observations of the nebula ( the h@xmath0 emission measure and the [ s  ii ] @xmath1036717,6731 line instensity ratio in the spatially resolved diffuse interior of the ring ) directly constrain the density of the ionized flow filling the inside the ring to be roughly 300 - 500 @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "thus , the ionized gas pressure is directly constrained observationally , and so the pressure there is known regardless of the geometry that creates it .",
    "while the pressure within this h  ii region is roughly uniform , the ram pressure of the wind drops with radius from the star if we assume a steady bsg wind ( @xmath105 density profile ) .",
    "then @xmath19 is the radius where the two balance , given by    @xmath106    where we have assumed @xmath107k in the h  ii region , @xmath108 is the bsg wind mass - loss rate in units of @xmath109m@xmath110yr@xmath3 , and @xmath111 is the wind speed in units of 300kms@xmath3 .",
    "we assumed a value for @xmath112 of 300kms@xmath3 , as above .",
    "these fiducial values are similar to the values adopted for the progenitor of sn  1987a by @xcite .    with these values ,",
    "the stand - off shock will be at @xmath113pc from the bsg .",
    "this is about 25% of the radius of the ring ( note that both sn  1987a and sbw1 have the same ring radius of @xmath110.2 pc ) . in the case of sbw1 , 25% of the ring radius roughly matches the location of the observed inner peaks of hot dust and enhanced h@xmath0 emission in images , which is why we chose these fiducial values . since the innermost dust near the shock front will be the hottest and brightest because it is radiatively heated by the star , we argued @xcite that this physical scenario may give a plausible explanation for the structures inside the ring .",
    "we subsequently proposed to obtain uv spectra to directly constrain sbw1 s mass - loss rate in order to test this picture .",
    "we were therefore surprised to find a mass - loss rate for sbw1 that is at least an order of magnitude lower than the fiducial value above . with @xmath114 10@xmath4 @xmath84 yr@xmath3 ( a conservative upper limit )",
    ", the radius of the stand - off shock between the bsg wind and the ionized photoevaporative flow should be much smaller , roughly @xmath1150.015 pc or only about 510% of the ring s radius . essentially , the bsg wind is so weak that it would be overwhelmed by the gas pressue of the photionized photoevaporative flow .",
    "colliding winds may therefore have difficulty explaining the pile - up of dust at the location of the observed ir peaks in images @xcite .",
    "a renewed investigation of this problem using hydrodynamic simulations is warranted .",
    "what , then , causes the peaks of dust emission at @xmath1125% of the radius of the ring ( at @xmath19@xmath1160.05 pc from the star ) ?",
    "as noted in our previous paper @xcite , the observed dust temperature estimated from the sed is only about 190  k ( and the expected equilibrium temperature is even lower at that radius ) so 0.05 pc can not mark the dust vaporization radius .",
    "something else must hold back the dust and prevent it from flowing closer to the star .",
    "a possibility is that direct stellar radiation pressure on dust grains helps keep them at bay , and that collisions couple this radiation pressure on dust to the gas .",
    "indeed , the magnitude of the radiation pressure @xmath117 inside the ring , for our derived stellar parameters of sbw1 , is comparable to or greater than the inferred ionized gas pressure for @xmath107 k and @xmath118=500 @xmath104 , suggesting that direct radiation pressure on dust should affect the structure and dynamics of the interior of the ring .",
    "so far , radiation pressure has not been included in simulations aiming to explain the origin and shaping of bsg rings like the ones around sn  1987a and sbw1 . however , the weakness of the observed wind from sbw1 reported here ( as well as the inferred weakness of the wind of sn  1987a s progenitor ) suggest that this should be undertaken . examining the hydrodynamics including",
    "radiation pressure is beyond the scope of this paper , but we note that the problem is reminiscent of recent studies of the dynamics and structure of dusty h  ii regions , where radiation pressure on dust is also found to be important @xcite .",
    "the relative influence of radiation pressure is even stronger in the case of sbw1 due to its extremely weak stellar wind for its luminosity .",
    "another possibility , which is difficult to rule out , is that the inner dust peaks arise from a past eruptive mass ejection akin to lbv eruptions @xcite .",
    "while the bsg wind can not form dust in its steady wind , it could potentially form dust in an episodic ejection of a dense shell ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this dust shell might then expand until it is stopped by the pressure of the photoevaporative flow , leaving a cavity in its wake to be filled by the very weak bsg wind . in this case",
    "it would be the momentum of the ( hypothetical ) eruptive mass ejection rather than the ram pressure of the bsg wind that would set the location of the inner dust peaks .",
    "this scenario is admittedly somewhat _ ad hoc _ , but there is precedent for it .",
    "sequential episodic ejections of rings have been inferred based on direct proper motions of the ring nebula around the massive binary ry scuti @xcite , for example . for a somewhat different type of system , hydrodynamic simulations of nova eruptions inside a slow , equatorially concentrated csm produced by rlof can yield a similar torus structure with inner density peaks @xcite .",
    "the very weak wind of sbw1 has an important consequence regarding the star s rotational evolution ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". such a low mass - loss rate will impair the star s ability to shed angular momentum via its wind .",
    "sbw1 currently has a rather slow rotation rate , with an equatorial rotation speed of only about 40 km s@xmath3 @xcite , which is only about 5% of its critical rotation speed .",
    "the current slow rotation rate coupled with the currently observed very low wind mass - loss rate presents a puzzle in connection with the observed ring nebula . as noted in the introduction , most scenarios to explain the existence of ring nebulae like the ones around sn  1987a and sbw1 invoke either ( 1 ) mass transfer through rlof in an interacting binary ( which would spin up the mass gainer and then shed mass through the outer lagrange point ) , ( 2 ) the merger of a close binary system resulting in a rapid rotator that excretes a disk , ring , or torus in the merger , or ( 3 ) post - rsg contraction to a bsg , spinning the star up to a rapidly rotating star that sheds an equatorial disk .",
    "all of these include a star that is rotating at or close to critical rotation when the ring is ejected . in the case of sbw1 , the ring is only about 10@xmath9 yr old @xcite .",
    "the puzzle , then , is how a star can go from ( presumably ) nearly critical rotation ( several 10@xmath40 @xmath88 ) to being such a slow rotator ( only 40 @xmath88 ) in such a short time if its wind is very weak . in this time",
    ", the star would shed a tiny fraction ( @xmath1110@xmath119 or less ) of its total mass .",
    "magnetic breaking would be the key mechanism to spin down the star , and indeed , it has been suggested that a stellar merger event - which might eject a ring - might also lead to very strong stellar magnetic fields @xcite . however , one expects the loss of angular momentum via magnetic breaking to be directly proportional to the mass - loss rate , which in the case of sbw1 is exceedingly low . even for massive stars with very strong ( a few to several kg ) fields and stronger winds , the spin - down timescale is a few to several myr @xcite , not 10@xmath9 yr .",
    "indeed , using a parameterized estimate for the spin - down time from equation 25 in @xcite , and adopting a generous 3 kg magnetic field , the parameters we estimate for sbw1 would suggest a spin - down timescale of @xmath1206 myr . it is therefore difficult to understand how the star could have slowed its rotation rate during the age of the nebula of only 10@xmath9 yr unless the mass - loss rate was much higher in the past .",
    "ways out of this puzzle may require some different ideas .",
    "observationally , at least , the gas and dust that partly fills the interior of the ring @xcite could be interpreted as evidence for a previous high @xmath121  phase , with a slow , dense , dusty wind that followed a merger and the ring s ejection .",
    "perhaps a highly time variable wind or eruption needs to be invoked to help resolve this issue .",
    "alternatively , perhaps a merger scenario different from proposed models is in order .",
    "for example , a merger of two blue stars ( rather than a rsg ) may lead to an envelope that is out of thermal equilibrium , as rotational energy is used to heat the merger product s envelope .",
    "the subsequent inflation of that envelope might allow a merger product to have a slow surface rotation rate at such a young age after a merger event .",
    "it is difficult to see how very rapid rotation can be avoided in a scenario wherein a merger occurs as a rsg , and then the merger product contracts to the blue while also maintaining a very low mass - loss rate .",
    "the low bsg wind mass - loss rate that we derive here is therefore an important constraint for models that aim to explain the origin and shaping of such ring nebulae with a merger event .",
    "sbw1 may be an interesting target for spectropolarimetry to investigate the possibility of a strong magnetic field , although this may be complicated by large interstellar polarization .",
    "it is interesting to note that some models predict that magnetic massive stars can avoid the rsg phase altogether , staying blue and exploding as bsgs @xcite .",
    "how this bsg star can avoid driving a much stronger wind with its current luminosity remains puzzling .",
    "we obtained the uv spectrum of the blue supergiant sbw1 using _ hst_/cos , with the aim of measuring the star s mass - loss rate in order to test a hypothesis regarding the shaping of the ring nebula .",
    "a cmfgen model was used to analyze this spectrum .",
    "we were surprised to find that the uv spectrum showed no signatures of wind emission or absorption , and the cmfgen model yielded a conservative upper limit to the mass - loss rate of 10@xmath1 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 .",
    "however , we suspect that the mass - loss rate of sbw1 is low enough that the uv diagnostics modeled by cmfgen are not good tracers of the wind , probably because the wind is unable to cool at such low density .",
    "we find that the cooling timescale is similar to or longer than the flow timecale in the inner wind if the mass - loss rate falls below 10@xmath4 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 , and adopt this value as a more likely upper limit for the wind mass - loss rate .",
    "even 10@xmath4 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 is much lower than expected for a bsg with sbw1 s physical parameters .",
    "this may present a problem for shaping the ring nebula with stellar wind interaction alone .",
    "we therefore speculate that radiation pressure on dust entrained in the photoevaporative flow off the ring may play an important dynamic role in shaping the nebula .",
    "moreover , the very weak wind will inhibit the star s ability to shed angular momentum , which is problematic given sbw1 s slow observed rotation speed of @xmath1140 km s@xmath3 . even with a generous magnetic field , we find that the likely spin - down timescale is several myr , which is much longer than the @xmath1110@xmath9 yr age of the ring nebula .",
    "this makes it difficult to understand how the ring could have been ejected in a merger event , which would be expected to leave behind a rapidly rotating star .",
    "based on the time dependence of radio emission , sn  1987a was also inferred to have a very weak wind for it s progenitor s physical parameters , so our finding for sbw1 may impact ideas about sn  1987a s pre - sn evolution and the shaping of its nebula .",
