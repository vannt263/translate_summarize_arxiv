    "the luminosity function ( lf ) , number of galaxies per unit volume per unit luminosity bin , is an important indicator of the distribution of galaxies over cosmological time . in particular , infrared ( ir )",
    "lfs provide useful information regarding the amount of energy released by galaxy activities .",
    "we can obtain , however , different information depending on the wavelength at which the lf is measured .",
    "for example , nir luminosity function should be regarded as a proxy of stellar mass function of galaxies , while various emission features in the mir provide clues to detailed dust properties related to the star - forming activities .",
    "dust emission peaks in the far - ir ( fir ) wavelengths and fir luminosities give insight to total infrared luminosity ( @xmath11 ) which is directly connected to overall bulk of energy emitted by star - formation activities .",
    "the construction of the infrared luminosity functions has begun based on the data obtained by _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) in the mid- and far - infrared , although the sample was restricted to bright galaxies because of relatively low sensitivity of the iras ( rowan - robinson , helou and walker 1987 ; saunders et al .",
    "1990 ; rowan - robinson et al .",
    "subsequently , _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) data was used to determine the mid - infrared ( 12 @xmath4 m and 15@xmath4 m ) lfs with follow - up imaging and spectroscopic observations ( clements et al .",
    "2001 ; xu et al .",
    "2000 ; pozzi et al .",
    "far - infrared lf was also estimated ( e.g. , 90 @xmath4 m lf by serjeant et al .",
    "2004 ) using the european large - area iso survey ( elais ) final ( optical - ir merged ) catalogue ( rowan - robinson et al . 2004 ) .",
    "based on the iras ( hacking et al .",
    "1987 ; franceschini et al . 1988 ; fang et al .",
    "1998 etc . ) and iso data ( elbaz et al . 1999",
    "; puget et al . 1999 ) , it has been revealed that dust - enshrouded star - forming galaxies undergo evolution in luminosity and density up to redshift around @xmath12 , and that their evolutionary rate may exceed those measured at any other wavelengths .",
    "the contribution of infrared luminous galaxies ( such as lirgs and ulirgs defined as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ) to the star formation ( sf ) history has been recognized and well established recently , implying the star forming activity was much more intense at higher redshifts ( @xmath2 ) than nearby universe .",
    "more accurate infrared luminosity functions ( irlfs ) have been derived for both local and distant galaxies observed from various fields based on the _ akari _ and _ spitzer _ data by many authors ( prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2005 ; babbedge et al .",

    "; wu et al . 2011 ) .",
    "they have found a positive evolution in luminosity and density and increasing importance of the lirgs and ulirgs populations toward higher redshifts , indicating that the universe was much more active in the past .",
    "recent interests have moved to even higher redshift beyond the peak ( @xmath15 ) of the cosmic sfr density ( e.g. , prez - gonzlez et al . 2005 ; rodighiero et al .",
    "2010 ; magnelli et al .",
    "2011 ) to understand the early history of the star formation .",
    "however , we still have many questions about the local universe and uncertainties in the parameters that can relate local galaxy formation and evolution with the global history of the universe . especially , accurate measurements of the lfs in the local universe is important in order to determine the course of evolution over cosmic time",
    ".    _ akari _ , an ir mission by jaxa / isas in japan with european and korean collaborations , has carried out all sky surveys at mid- and far - infrared ( murakami et al .",
    "_ akari _ also carried out a number of wide area surveys with better sensitivities than all - sky survey , including the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) surveys which used continuous nine spectral bands ranging from 2 to 24 @xmath4 m .",
    "the nep survey was composed of two programs : wide and deep surveys .",
    "the nep - deep survey covered about 0.4 deg@xmath1 field with higher sensitivity ( matsuhara et al .",
    "2006 ; wada et al .",
    "2008 ; takagi et al .",
    "2012 ) , while the nep - wide survey covered much wider area of about 5.4 deg@xmath1 with lower sensitivity .",
    "the nep - wide survey is about 0.50.6 mag shallower than nep - deep survey in the nir and mir - s bands .",
    "the scientific purpose and overall plan of the nep survey projects were presented by matsuhara et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and detailed description on the nep - wide and nep - deep surveys including their ir source catalogues have been published by kim et al .",

    "they used @xmath3 4,000 ir sources and estimated photometric redshifts to determine the distances to galaxies based on sed model fitting .",
    "recently , they updated their lfs using newly obtained cfht data ( goto et al .",
    "2015 ) . in this work ,",
    "we use the nep - wide survey data which has more galaxy sample in the local universe , where g10 did not cover .",
    "the primary purpose of this work is to present more accurate luminosity functions for the redshift @xmath0 using only spectroscopic sample in the nep - wide field .",
    "therefore , our study complements to g10 in the following aspects .",
    "first , we use the nep - wide survey data covering the wider angular coverage ( 5.4 deg@xmath1 ) that allows us to minimize the cosmic variance .",
    "second , since the photometric depth of the nep - wide survey is shallower , we concentrate on the derivation of the luminosity function for the local universe within @xmath16 , whereas g10 measured the 8@xmath4 m and 12@xmath4 m lfs for the redshift range @xmath17 .",
    "finally , we take advantage of the spectroscopic redshifts ( spec - z ) for galaxies in the nep - wide field obtained by the follow - up spectroscopic surveys ( shim et al .",
    "2013 ) with mmt / hectospec and wiyn / hydra .",
    "thus , our estimation of the distances to the galaxies would be accurate .",

    "the imaging survey toward the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) was carried out on the circular area of about 5.4 deg@xmath1 with nine photometric bands of the infrared camera ( irc , onaka et al .",
    "2007 ) , covering the spectral range of 2  24 @xmath4 m nearly continuously .",

    "background gray tiles in this figure represent 446 pointed observations carried out using irc instruments to cover the whole nep field .",
    "the 5-@xmath34 detection limits of nep - wide survey are approximately 21 magnitude ( mag ) in the nir bands , 19.5  19 mag in the mir - s bands , and 18.8  18.5 mag in the mir - l bands in ab mag , respectively .",

    "the depth of the nir bands are affected by source confusion while those of the mir bands are less affected by confusion because of the lower source density .",
    "the number of sources in the mir bands typically ranges from a few thousands to about eighteen thousands .",

    "some sample fits better to agn template which gave a smaller @xmath74 than that of a best - fit galaxy template , although we used objects classified as various types of ` galaxy ' based on the optical line analysis . in this case , both template showed similar acceptable fit over the entire data points ( see the last sample presented in figure 4 ) .",
    "considering rather complex mir features and larger photometric uncertainties in the longest part of mir bands , slight confusion between galaxies and agns for some sample seems inevitable .",
    "because the seds from both types are very similar in the mir , the sources fitted better to agn types do not make significant difference in our resulting mir lfs .        the k - correction ( oke @xmath81 sandage , 1968 ) , which transforms the measured flux at a given wavelength to the unredshifted flux at that band , is also computed in this procedure .",
    "we checked the amount of k - corrections for the mir bands where we derive the lfs , assuming simple box function centered at 8 and 12 @xmath4 m having full - width of 2 @xmath4 m and using l15 band response function .",
    "k - correction , depending on the sed of galaxy , its redshift ( @xmath2 ) , and the filter response ( @xmath82 ) , can be computed by @xmath83 figure 5 shows the k - corrections at 8 @xmath4 m , 12 @xmath4 m , and 15 @xmath4 m bands for a few representative sed models from the polleta et al .",
    "these figures show substantial differences in the k - correction behavior for different types of galaxies because the seds in mir portion vary significantly depending on galaxy types .",
    "for example , the 8 @xmath4 m bands show sensitive dependencies , because there are pah features at 6.2 @xmath4 m , 7.7 @xmath4 m , and 8.6 @xmath4 m and some of them can be included or excluded in this band depending on the redshift .",
    "in particular , 8.6 @xmath4 m feature is located near the boundary of the 8 @xmath4 m band , and thus can be excluded for the galaxies at low but non - zero redshift . from z @xmath3 0.11 , the 7.7 @xmath4 m pah feature begins to move out of this band .",
    "the k - correction is small but not negligible in the mir bands for nearby galaxies . in the case of early - type galaxies ,",
    "k - correction decreases monotonically with redshifts since the flux decreases with wavelength near these bands .",
    "our sample used for this work is located at @xmath0 and mostly appears to be normal spiral / sf galaxies ( strongly dominated by late - types ) , explainable with m51 type ( cyan dot - dashed lines in figure 5 ) , while actively star forming populations such as arp 220 ( or lirg / ulirgs ) or agn types appear to take a very small faction .",
    "luminosity function @xmath84 is the number density of galaxies having luminosity in the range @xmath85 and residing in a specific volume .",
    "therefore , we should take a volume limited sample and count all the galaxies in a given luminosity bin and divide it by the surveyed volume . however , it is not as simple since the sample is usually limited by flux rather than volume .",
    "it means that the survey volume depends on the brightness or luminosity of the objects in the observation . in order to account for this simple fact , @xmath7 method ( as described by schmidt , 1968 )",
    "is widely used to obtain the lfs of flux limited sample .",
    "this method is known to be relatively insensitive to the incompleteness of the observations , and there is no parametric dependence or assumed model .",
    "one can calculate luminosity ( @xmath86 ) in the rest frame or absolute magnitude ( @xmath87 ) based on a redshift and observed sed ( observed magnitudes @xmath88 at each band ) of each source , by following formula , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the luminosity distance ( in units of mpc ) and k is @xmath91-correction .",
    "using this equation , we can compute @xmath92 , which is the maximum redshift at which a source could be observed with the detection limits of the survey ( at which @xmath93 detection limit ) . when converting the observed flux ( or magnitude ) in observed wavelength to luminosity of the rest - frame wavelength ,",
    "we need to apply @xmath91-correction , which is calculated using the best - fit template for each source ( sec .",
    "a comoving volume @xmath94 associated with a source is the maximum volume corresponding to the maximum redshift within which the source could be still detected , where @xmath95 is the lower limit of the redshift bin . if @xmath92 is larger than the upper limit of the interested redshift bin ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) , we take smaller one , i.e. , @xmath92 = min ( @xmath97 of the z - bin , @xmath92 of a source ) .",

    "since our sample is not a complete set and has photometric uncertainties , we should take these facts into account in deriving the lfs .",
    "first , the number of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts are much smaller than that of parent photometric sources in the nep - wide field , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "we compared the number distribution of the spectroscopic sample with that of entire s11 sources from the nep - wide catalogue as a function of magnitude to obtain the selection function for spectroscopic sample because the targets for the spectroscopic observations are selected based mainly on the s11 magnitude . in figure 6",

    "the solid brown line shows the sources classified as galaxies , which are used for the estimation of lfs .",
    "the uncertainty associated with the correction for the number of the spec - z sample can be explained by the poisson statistics in the number of the parent photometric and spectroscopic sample .",
    "it is normally a few % level at @xmath106 mag ( ab ) , but reaches around @xmath107 at @xmath108 mag due to the smaller number of sample .",
    "this correction uncertainty appears to affect error - bar sizes of lf by several % on average ( @xmath107 at most ) .",
    "second , the parent photometric data becomes partially incomplete near the detection limit . at the mir - s ( s7  s11 )",
    "bands , the detection limit ranges 19.5  19 mag and the 50% completeness levels are @xmath3 0.6 mag brighter than the detection limits . the magnitude difference between the 90 @xmath109 and 10 @xmath109 completeness is about 0.7  0.8 mag , indicating that the completeness begins to drop quite rapidly from around 90 @xmath109 level ( 18.3  17.9 mag )",
    ". we should also be careful at the bright end because the low sampling rate could derive unnatural selection function . in figure 6 ,",
    "the green dotted line with the right - side vertical axis indicates the completeness level at s11 band obtained by simulation of artificial source injection and re - extraction tests as described by kim et al .",
    "a vertical dot - dashed gray line roughly corresponds to the primary selection criteria for the spectroscopic observation ( 50@xmath109 completeness limit of the nep - wide survey ) .",
    "we applied the correction for this photometric incompleteness based on the completeness estimation of the @xmath28 data that was obtained by kim et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in our derivation of the lfs .",
    "there is also redshift bias as shown in the right - hand panel of figure 1 .",
    "we compared the number density of spectroscopic sources in the comoving volume corresponding to each redshift bin in order to estimate the redshift incompleteness . assuming constant number density , we estimated the correction for incompleteness as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "since our derivation of lfs is limited to @xmath0 where the source distribution is roughly consistent with the constant spatial density , we regard the redshift bias is not significant .",
    "rest frame luminosity is directly derived from sed - fit results , therefore , error estimation for luminosity function ( lf ) depends on the sed - fitting errors arising from redshift , @xmath110-correction error , and photometric uncertainties .",
    "since we used the redshifts measured by spectroscopic observation , we can ignore uncertainties from the redshifts ( which is very small ) .",
    "thus , our lf errors can be determined based mostly on the photometric error . in order to estimate the errors of the lfs",
    ", we carried out monte carlo simulation using random number generator .",
    "we generated more than 10,000 simulated catalogues by putting random errors into the measured flux of each source .",
    "in the simulated catalogues , those errors are realized by assuming a normal gaussian distribution centered at the observed flux .",
    "standard deviation of this gaussian distribution for simulated errors is determined based on photometry measurement error .",
    "this means we generated @xmath3 10,000 input catalogues for le phare runs doing sed - fit and obtained result sets , which finally results in slightly different 10,000 lfs .",
