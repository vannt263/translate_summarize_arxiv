    "in a recent paper @xcite we took a fresh look at the light  like boost of the schwarzschild gravitational field which was originally worked out in an important paper by aichelburg and sexl @xcite .",
    "our point of view entailed emphasising the role of the riemann tensor rather than the metric .",
    "we illustrated this by calculating in @xcite the light like boost of a weyl static , axially symmetric gravitational field .",
    "more recently we have described the light  like boost , from our point of view , of domain walls and cosmic strings @xcite and of the kerr gravitational field @xcite .",
    "we present here a novel application of some of these `` boosted gravitational fields '' by using them to study the deflection of highly relativistic particles in the original `` unboosted '' gravitational fields .",
    "this in turn can shed some light on properties of the boosted gravitational fields themselves .",
    "the particles we consider are ultrarelativistic in the sense that they are travelling with speed close to the speed of light .",
    "hence our point of view involves an approximation in which the leading terms in the angles of deflection that we calculate are the most accurate for large impact parameter .    to illustrate and test our point of view we apply it , in section 2 , to the simple case of the scattering of a high speed charge off a nucleus in electromagnetic theory .",
    "we obtain the well known angle of deflection in this case . in section 3",
    "we give a general description of the deflection of a high speed test particle in gravitational fields modeled by a class of spacetimes which include the light  like boosted schwarzschild , kerr and weyl space  times and the space  time of a boosted cosmic string .",
    "this is used in section 4 to provide four examples : deflection of a high speed test particle in the schwarzschild field , the kerr field , the weyl gravitational field of an isolated , static , axially symmetric multipole source , and the field of a cosmic string .",
    "the leading terms in the angles of deflection that we obtain coincide with einstein s angle of deflection of a photon path in the schwarzschild field and with the angle of deflection obtained , for example , by boyer and lindquist @xcite for a photon equatorial path in the kerr field . in the case of a weyl field",
    "we demonstrate that there are two contributions to the deflection .",
    "there is a deflection _ out _ of a plane orthogonal to the axis of symmetry due to the presence of the _ odd _ multipole moments of the source and a deflection _ within _ such a plane due to the _ even _ multipole moments , as one would expect . in section 5",
    "we discuss the deflection of a high speed particle having intrinsic spin .",
    "a solution is given for the case of a spinning particle ( moving in the equatorial plane of the source ) when the spin is aligned with the symmetry axis .",
    "we wish to consider the deflection of a high speed charge @xmath0 off a nucleus carrying a charge @xmath1 . in the rest frame @xmath2 of the nucleus we place @xmath1 at the spatial origin and consider @xmath0 projected with 3velocity @xmath3 in the positive @xmath4direction .",
    "we shall use units in which the velocity of light @xmath5 .",
    "hence for a high speed encounter we consider @xmath3 to be close to unity . in the rest frame @xmath6 of the charge @xmath0 the nucleus appears to be travelling in the negative @xmath7direction with speed close to the speed of light .",
    "we will consider what happens if , with respect to the frame @xmath6 , the nucleus of charge @xmath1 is boosted to the speed of light . in this case",
    "the observer in the frame @xmath6 , using the rectangular cartesian coordinates and time @xmath8 , sees an electromagnetic field given via the 2form @xcite @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the dirac delta function which is singular on the null hyperplane @xmath12 .",

    "element @xmath13 bergmann @xcite was the first to observe that to a high speed observer the coulomb field of a point charge increasingly resembles the field of an impulsive electromagnetic wave as the speed of the observer relative to the charge approaches the speed of light .",
    "we see from ( [ 2.1 ] ) that in addition to the delta function singularity the field is also singular at @xmath14 on @xmath12 , which is one of the null geodesic generators of the null hyperplane",

    "( the speed of light ) so that to the observer in @xmath6 the field of the charge @xmath1 is given approximately by the impulsive wave ( [ 2.1 ] ) . to calculate the deflection of the charge @xmath0 in @xmath45 we take for @xmath24 in @xmath6 : @xmath49 and so in view of ( [ 2.6 ] ) @xmath50 .",
    "then in @xmath51 for @xmath24 we have , by ( [ 2.8 ] ) , @xmath52 .",
    "it then follows from ( [ 2.6 ] ) that for @xmath25 we have in @xmath6 : @xmath53 we note that with @xmath54 and the third equation in ( [ 2.7 ] ) yields @xmath55 . thus using ( [ 2.8 ] )",
    "again we find that in @xmath45 for @xmath25 : @xmath56 the direction of motion of @xmath0 in @xmath45 is the angle the 3velocity vector of @xmath0 makes with the @xmath4direction . if this angle is @xmath57 ( say ) then for @xmath58 while for @xmath25 we see from ( [ 2.10 ] ) that @xmath59 with in our case @xmath3 close to unity . by ( [ 2.7 ] ) with the conditions for @xmath24 that we have chosen we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "hence for @xmath3 close to unity ( [ 2.11 ] ) gives the small angle of deflection @xmath57 of the high speed charge @xmath1 to be @xmath62 this is positive if @xmath63 . to check that we have arrived here at the correct angle of scattering for a high speed charge @xmath1 scattered by a nucleus @xmath0 we can , for example , consult synge @xcite .",
    "synge s exact formula for the angle of scattering is @xmath64 where @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 given by @xmath68 for large @xmath69 this gives approximately @xmath70 and from ( [ 2.13 ] ) we have @xmath71 which agrees with ( [ 2.12 ] ) .",
    "for the remainder of this paper we will consider @xmath2 to be the rest  frame of a gravitating source and @xmath6 to be the rest  frame of a high speed test particle .",
    "by analogy with the electromagnetic example above we shall calculate the deflection of a highly relativistic test particle moving in a gravitational field . in section 4 this deflection is evaluated explicitly for a high speed test particle moving in the schwarzschild field , the kerr field , the field of a static , axially symmetric multipole source and the field of a cosmic string . to the high speed observer in the frame @xmath6",
