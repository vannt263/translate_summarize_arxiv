    "hr 8799 ( hd 218396 , hip 114189 ) is a @xmath0 doradus - type star , a class characterized by pulsations on time - scales longer than the typical @xmath11 scuti stars , their neighbors on the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram @xcite .",
    "hr 8799 is also a @xmath1 bootis - type star , which is a spectroscopically - defined group of non - magnetic , chemically peculiar , population i a- and early f - type stars that show metal deficiencies in fe - peak elements while showing solar to slightly over solar abundances of c , n , o , and s @xcite .",
    "in addition , hr 8799 is a `` vega - like '' star , possessing excess infrared emission longward of @xmath12 @xmath13 m @xcite , attributed to thermal emission from a debris disk .    aside from these",
    "three distinguishing characteristics , interest in hr 8799 was amplified in 2008 with the discovery of three planet - like companions at projected separations of 24 , 38 and 68 au @xcite . from comparisons of the observed fluxes to the predictions of evolutionary models , marois et al . estimated companion masses of 5 - 11  @xmath14 for companion b and 7 - 13  @xmath14 for companions c and d , each . because the masses of the companions depend on the age of the system , marois et al . used four lines of reasoning to estimate the host star s age : ( 1 ) comparing the star s galactic space motion to other young stars in the solar neighborhood , ( 2 ) placing the star on a color - magnitude diagram , ( 3 ) characterizing the typical ages of @xmath1 boo and @xmath0 dor stars , and ( 4 ) the assumption that hr 8799 has a massive debris disk , which is typically only found associated with young stars ( @xmath15 myr ) . based on these characteristics , they constrained an age range between 30 and 160 myr .",
    "a fourth companion was imaged two years later with an estimated mass of 7@xmath16 @xmath14 if the system is 30 myr old and 10@xmath17 @xmath14 if 60 myr old @xcite .",
    "@xcite fit atmospheric and evolution models to the data to determine the masses , radii , temperatures , gravities , and cloud properties for the planets .",
    "they found masses of 26 @xmath14 for planet b and 8 - 11 @xmath14 for planets c and d , though they acknowledge that their model fit for b s mass is not likely to be the true value .",
    "they also determined an age range of 360 myr , 40 - 100 my , and 30 - 100 myr for each planet , respectively .",
    "the ages adopted by @xcite have become a topic of some debate .",
    "the star s age is of vital interest because it is directly linked to the masses of the companions . if the star is young , its companions are brighter and their inferred masses are lower ",
    "i.e. , planets  than if the star is older , in which case its more massive companions ",
    "i.e. , brown dwarfs  have cooled significantly and could be mistaken for planets @xcite .",
    "for example , if hr 8799 is as old as the hyades ( 625 myr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all companions would be more massive than 13.6 @xmath14 , and thus more appropriately called brown dwarfs according to popular convention .",
    "one example of the effect of presumed ages on masses involved the announcement by @xcite of a directly imaged planetary companion to 1rxs j160929.1210524 in the upper scorpius association , which relied on an assumed cluster age of 5 myr .",
    "soon afterward , @xcite determined an older age for the cluster : 11@xmath18 myr . in this case , the imaged companion has a mass of @xmath1914 @xmath14 , putting it just above the planetary mass limit .",
    "@xcite refute the @xcite young age of hr 8799 on all four counts .",
    "they point out that ( 1 ) space motions of young disk stars are often inconclusive , ( 2 ) the uncertain internal metallicity of hr 8799 makes comparisons with evolutionary models and other stellar clusters unreliable , ( 3 ) that @xmath1 boo and @xmath0 dor type stars have a broad range of ages , and ( 4 ) that debris disks are `` highly chaotic and unpredictable '' , and can not be used to estimate stellar age .",
    "@xcite instead determined hr 8799 s age by modeling @xmath0 dor pulsations detected by @xcite and adopting spectroscopic parameters by @xcite .",
    "although primarily limited by the unknown inclination of the star s rotation axis , they find a preferred age of between 1.1 and 1.5 gyr ; again , this age implies that the companions to hr 8799 are brown dwarfs .",
    "@xcite subsequently challenged the claim made by @xcite , finding an age of the system of @xmath19100 myr after considering the limiting case for orbital stability ; at these relatively small separations , massive companions would not be dynamically stable on long timescales .",
    "they used the double 4:2:1 mean motion resonance configuration presented by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a way to ensure dynamical stability by avoiding close encounters .",
    "moro - martn et al .",
    "used evolutionary models to predict ages from 150 to 350 myr and conclude that the dynamical state of the system favors an age of @xmath19100 myr , which places the companions just shy of the brown dwarf regime .",
    "however , they point out that the average temperature of 7350 k and luminosity of 5 @xmath5 from @xcite and @xcite implies an age for the star that is very young when compared to other @xmath1 boo stars .",
    "in addition to these recent attempts to estimate hr 8799 s age , many other efforts have been made to determine its age in the last decade .",
    "the resulting values vary from 20 myr up to 1.5 gyr . in table",
    "[ lit_params ] , we summarize both the attempts described above and other efforts .",
    "a variety of methods were utilized , including inspecting the star s proper motion , comparing its position on an h - r diagram with isochrones , inspecting the star for infrared excess , asteroseismology , astrometry , spectroscopy , dynamical stability analysis , disk symmetry , direct imaging , and group membership .    here",
    "we seek to greatly improve our understanding of hr 8799 s age by using interferometric observations to directly measure its angular diameter .",
    "this value , when combined with the _ hipparcos _ parallax , yields the star s physical radius . in combination with hr",
    "8799 s bolometric flux determined from broad - band photometry , the stellar luminosity and effective temperature are precisely determined . using these results",
    "we provide new age and mass estimates based on comparisons with the stellar evolutionary models , adopting a metallicity most appropriate for @xmath1 boo stars and hr 8799 in particular .",
    "specifically , section 2 describes the interferometric observations and calibrator star selection ; section 3 discusses the visibility measurements and how stellar parameters were calculated , including angular diameter , radius , luminosity , and temperature ; section 4 explores the physical implications of the interferometric observations ; and section 5 summarizes our findings .",
    "observations were obtained using the center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array , a six element optical - infrared interferometer located on mount wilson , california @xcite .",
    "all observations used the precision astronomical visible observations ( pavo ) beam combiner with a spectral bandpass of @xmath19650 - 800 nm . for a description of the pavo instrument and data reduction procedure ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we observed hr 8799 over seven nights spanning two years with the s2-w2 and s1-e1 telescope pairs with maximum baselines of 177 m and 331 m , respectively .",
    "we interleaved calibrator star and hr 8799 observations so that every target was flanked by calibrator observations made as close in time as possible , which allowed us to convert instrumental target and calibrator visibilities to calibrated visibilities for the target .",
    "calibrators are stars with predicted diameters that are significantly smaller and in close proximity in the sky to the target star .",
    "reliable calibrators were chosen to be single stars with angular diameter estimates @xmath200.3 mas so they were nearly unresolved on the baseline used , which meant uncertainties in each calibrator s diameter did not affect the target s diameter calculation as much as if the calibrator star had a larger angular size .    in order to estimate the reddening of each calibrator star , we obtained the tycho ( @xmath21 ) color from @xcite and converted to ( @xmath22 ) using the table in @xcite .",
    "we then compared the observed ( @xmath22 ) value with the list of intrinsic ( @xmath22 ) colors as a function of spectral type given by @xcite to arrive at an estimate of e(@xmath22 ) , and adopted the reddening law described in @xcite to de - redden the observed magnitudes .",
    "the photometric angular diameters were then determined using the relationship between the ( @xmath23 ) color and log @xmath24 from @xcite .",
    "the error in the diameters is due to the relative calibration error stated in the @xcite paper as well as errors in photometry measurements .",
    "table [ cals ] lists the input photometry and resulting photometrically estimated angular diameters of the calibrator stars .",
    "the observed quantity of an interferometer is fringe contrast or `` visibility '' , more formally defined as the correlation of two wave - fronts whose amplitude is the visibility squared ( @xmath25 ) , which is fit to a model of a uniformly - illuminated disk ( ud ) that represents the face of the star .",
    "diameter fits to @xmath25 were based upon the ud approximation given by @xmath26 / x)^2 $ ] , where @xmath27 is the first - order bessel function and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the projected baseline at the star s position , @xmath30 is the apparent ud angular diameter of the star , and @xmath1 is the effective wavelength of the observation @xcite .",
    "a more realistic model of a star s disk involves limb - darkening ( ld ) , and the relationship incorporating the linear ld coefficient @xmath31 @xcite is : @xmath32^{2 } .\\ ] ] table [ calib_visy ] lists the date of observation , the calibrator used , @xmath1/@xmath29 , the calibrated visibilities ( @xmath25 ) , and errors in @xmath25 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the ld coefficient was obtained from @xcite after adopting the effective temperature ( @xmath34 ) and surface gravity ( log  @xmath35 ) values from @xcite , which were 7586 k and 4.35 , respectively .",
    "the resulting ud and ld angular diameters are listed in table [ results ] .",
    "figures [ hd218396_072510 ] through [ hd218396_bycal ] show the ld diameter fits for hr 8799 by night and by calibrator and figure [ hd218396_all ] shows all the data combined . table [ hr8799_diams ] lists the resulting angular diameter fits for each night using each calibrator , and figure [ hd218396_diams ] shows a graphical version of the results . though there is some scatter in the diameter fit from each night / calibrator combination , the scatter from the 2011 data is less pronounced than from 2010 data , which is seen in the diameter fits shown in figures [ hd218396_082011 ] through [ hd218396_093011 ] . in particular , for observations obtained in 2010 , the data exhibit sinusoidal - like variations about the best angular diameter fit ; the variations are not seen in 2011 data .",
    "this is almost certainly due to coating asymmetries between chara array telescopes ( particularly overcoated silver versus aluminum ) that were present in 2010 but removed in 2011 .",
    "attempts were made to search for polarization effects that would cause these residuals , but no conclusive evidence was found .",
    "visibilities were , however , never measured in full stokes parameters in a configuration that showed these residuals .    because the 2011 data show none of the sinusoidal residuals , our final @xmath24 incorporates the data from 2011 only .",
    "this yielded an angular diameter of 0.341@xmath20.008 mas .",
    "when the data from all nights and using all calibrators are fit together , @xmath24 is 0.347@xmath20.007 mas , which is within the uncertainty of the adopted value .",
    "the uncertainty for @xmath24 was calculated as described in the supplemental material from @xcite : for each one of 10,000 monte - carlo simulated gaussian distributions , we calibrated the instrumental visibilities and fit an angular diameter to the calibrated data using a least - squares minimization .",
    "we accounted for random errors by adding random numbers generated from the empirical covariance matrix scaled by the reduced @xmath36 of the original fit , and then repeated the procedure .",
    "the final uncertainty was the resulting standard deviation of the total distribution .",
    "we observed hr 8799 with multiple calibrator stars every night except one to check on the behavior of the calibrators themselves .",
    "for example , when three calibrator stars were used , we used calibrator 1 to determine the angular diameters of calibrator 2 and calibrator 3 to make sure the stars were reliable . the calibrator hd 214698 shows the largest scatter , which is expected because it is the smallest calibrator of the three .",
    "there will naturally be more uncertainty when measuring its calibrated visibilities using the other two larger stars .",
    "the scatter seen in the night - to - night measurements is expected because the stars are small and very nearly unresolved .      at a distance of @xmath37 pc @xcite ,",
    "hr 8799 s @xmath24 of @xmath38 mas corresponds to a stellar radius cm , consistent with an average of previous measurements @xcite . ] of @xmath39 @xmath4 , corresponding to a precision of 4@xmath3 .",
    "we note that this radius is 8@xmath3 larger than the radius inferred from photometric and temperature considerations in @xcite and subsequently adopted in recent asteroseismic analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; only 1@xmath3 of this discrepancy can be attributed to the pre - revised hipparcos distance used in the calculation of @xcite .    in order to determine the luminosity ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath34 of hr 8799",
    ", we first constructed its photometric energy distribution ( ped ) from the averages ( when multiple measurements were available ) of johnson @xmath41 magnitudes , strmgren @xmath42 magnitudes , and 2mass @xmath43 magnitudes , as published in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "table [ photometry ] summarizes the adopted magnitudes ; the assigned uncertainties for the 2mass infrared measurements are as reported , and for optical measurements are standard deviations of multiple measurements .",
    "the assigned uncertainties of the optical measurements therefore account for the low amplitude optical variability ( @xmath44 mag ) observed for this variable star @xcite .",
    "the bolometric flux ( @xmath45 ) of hr 8799 was determined by finding the best fit ( via @xmath36 minimization ) stellar spectral template from the flux - calibrated stellar spectral atlas of @xcite .",
    "this best ped fit allows for extinction , using the wavelength - dependent reddening relations of @xcite . the best fit was found using a f0 v template with an assigned temperature of @xmath46 k , an extinction of @xmath47 = 0.00 @xmath2 0.01 mag , and a @xmath45 of @xmath48 ( a 1.1@xmath3 precision ) .",
    "figure [ hd218396_sed ] shows the best fit and the results are listed in table [ results ] . to check for possible systematic biases in our adopted prescription",
    ", we also fit the ped using synthetic kurucz spectral models , assuming no extinction .",
    "the resulting @xmath45 estimate is consistent to within the 1.1@xmath3 error reported above , further validating our technique and measured @xmath45 .",
    "the bolometric flux was then combined with the distance to hr 8799 to estimate its luminosity ( @xmath49 d@xmath50 ) , which yielded a value of @xmath51 @xmath5 .",
    "the uncertainty in the luminosity ( 6@xmath3 ) is predominantly set by the uncertainty in the distance .",
    "the @xmath45 was also combined with the star s @xmath24 to determine its effective temperature by inverting the relation , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the stefan - bolzmann constant .",
    "this produces an effective temperature of @xmath54 k , determined to a precision of 1@xmath3 .",
    "because @xmath55 is chosen using a given @xmath34 , we used our new @xmath34 value to select @xmath55 and iterated .",
    "@xmath55 increased by only 0.01 to 0.49@xmath20.02 , @xmath24 increased by 0.001 mas to 0.342@xmath20.008 mas , and @xmath34 decreased by 10 k to 7193 k. the very slight change in @xmath24 did not affect the radius calculation at all .",
    "we note that this @xmath34 is nearly identical to the assigned temperature of the best fit stellar templates used to calculate @xmath45 .",
    "however , our interferometric @xmath34 is significantly less model dependent , and it is important to verify the accuracy of the @xmath34 predicted by the ped .",
    "moreover , our measured @xmath34 is also consistent with the detailed spectral type classification by @xcite of ka5 hf0 ma5 v @xmath1 boo , following the spectral - type temperature scale for dwarf stars assembled in @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen lines are better tracer of the stellar @xmath34 ( hf0 ; 7200 k ) ; the metal lines suggest a higher @xmath34 ( ma5 ; 8200 k ) only because its atmosphere is slightly metal depleted .    a potential bias in the size measurement of any a - type star is oblateness caused by rapid rotation .",
    "@xcite measured a @xmath56 of 49 km s@xmath57 and assuming the planets orbit in the same plane as stellar rotation , the actual rotation velocity will increase from 49 to 104 km s@xmath57 when the 28@xmath58 inclination is taken into account @xcite .",
    "for an a5 v star with an approximate mass of 2.1 @xmath59 @xcite , our measured radius of 1.44 @xmath4 , and the relation between @xmath60 , oblateness , and @xmath56 described in @xcite , the predicted oblateness of hr 8799 is only @xmath192@xmath3 and thus within the 1-@xmath53 errors in @xmath24 . using the f0 v spectral type , which is a closer fit to our measured @xmath34 ,",
    "the estimated mass is 1.6 @xmath59 and the predicted oblateness is 2.6@xmath3 , still a small effect .",
    "hr 8799 is currently the only directly imaged multiple planet system and there may be smaller , more earth - like planets orbiting the star or even moons orbiting the imaged planets that have not yet been detected .",
    "this would present the possibility of life if the planets were in the habitable zone ( hz ) of the star , so we used our new precise measurements to improve the estimate of the system s hz .",
    "we used the following equations from @xcite : @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath63(@xmath34 ) and @xmath64(@xmath34 ) are the critical fluxes at the inner and outer boundaries in units of the solar constant .",
    "the inner and outer physical boundaries @xmath65 in au were then calculated using @xmath66 these equations assume the hz is dependent on distance only and do not take other effects , such as tidal heating , into account .",
    "the inner boundary is the limit where a runaway greenhouse effect would evaporate any surface water while the outer boundary is the limit where a cloudless atmosphere could maintain a surface temperature of 273 k. @xcite note that these equations produce a conservatively small hz and the actual hz may be wider .",
    "we obtained habitable zone boundaries of 1.62 au and 3.32 au .",
    "hr 8799 s planets have semimajor axes of 14.5 to 68 au @xcite .",
    "there is no chance the planets orbit anywhere near the habitable zone unless they are highly eccentric , which is a configuration more likely to be unstable .",
    "the accurately determined stellar properties of hr 8799 also allow for detailed comparisons with stellar evolutionary models from which a mass and age can be inferred .",
    "however , correctly interpreting masses and especially ages depends critically upon knowing the internal abundances of this peculiar abundance star . as noted in the introduction ,",
    "the atmospheric abundances of fe - peak elements are distinctly subsolar ( [ fe / h ] @xmath67 dex ) while the abundances of c , n , o , and s are essentially solar . because these surface abundances may not directly trace the internal abundances",
    ", it is unclear which , if any , of the available uniformly scaled abundance models to adopt for these comparisons ; we subsequently refer to the abundance of the uniformly scaled model that predicts properties most consistent with observational constraints as the _ effective abundance_.    as an example of the effect on the inferred ages , comparisons of hr 8799 with models that assume subsolar abundances throughout yield ages of @xmath68 gyr for [ fe / h]= @xmath69 or @xmath70 gyr for [ fe / h ] = @xmath71 , while those that assume near - solar abundances ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath72 ) yield an age of @xmath73 gyr ; the specific physical assumptions used in these models are described in section 4.3 .",
    "obviously , the polyabundic atmospheres of @xmath1 boo stars and their uncertain internal abundance compromises the validity of these comparisons and the inferred values .",
    "nevertheless , we present the available observational evidence for constraining the metallicity of @xmath1 boo stars , and hr 8799 in particular , and suggest the effective abundance of hr 8799 , and perhaps all @xmath1 boo stars , is near solar .    the observationally favored theory to explain the @xmath1 boo phenomenon , originally proposed by @xcite , is that the atmospheres have been polluted by the accretion of fe - peak depleted gas .",
    "depletion is believed to occur because of grain formation ; a similar depletion of fe - like elements has been observed in interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "the grains that themselves accrete fe - elements are consequently inhibited from accreting on to the star because of the stronger radiation pressure they experience .",
    "it is not clear why this accretion onto the grains occurs , or where the accreting material comes from .",
    "it may be interstellar , but in many cases appears to be circumstellar . as noted by @xcite , all four @xmath1 boo stars within 40 pc (",
    "including hr 8799 ) exhibit an infrared excess that is interpreted as the presence of circumstellar dust , while only @xmath74 of non-@xmath1 boo a - type stars exhibit such excesses .",
    "the apparent depletion of these elements requires only relatively low accretion rates ( @xmath75 m@xmath76 yr@xmath77 ) , because of the shallow convective zones in a - type stars @xcite .",
    "accretion at these rates will quickly establish abundance anomalies within a few myr , but these anomalies will likewise disappear in as little as 1 myr once the accretion has terminated @xcite ; the interesting implication is that all @xmath1 boo stars are either currently accreting , or have only recently terminated their accretion .",
    "if this favored theory is correct , it suggests that the depleted fe - peak abundances do not represent the internal abundances of these stars . given this and the typical limiting main - sequence lifetime of @xmath192 gyr for these intermediate mass population i stars",
    ", one would expect their internal abundance to be on average close to solar .",
    "we note that an alternative mechanism to explain the @xmath1 boo phenomenon proposed by @xcite suggests that the depletion of fe - peak elements is a result of diffusion and mass loss . in this case , @xmath1 boo stars are much closer to the end of their main - sequence lifetimes . to be effective",
    ", the star would need to be losing mass at a rate of order @xmath75 m@xmath76 yr@xmath77 for a few times @xmath78 yr and thus implies that the @xmath1 boo phenomenon be restricted to the end of the main - sequence evolutionary phase for a stars .",
    "this predicted timescale is difficult to reconcile with the discovery of very young @xmath1 boo stars in the orion ob1 associations ( age @xmath79 myr ) , and the lack of any @xmath1 boo stars in intermediate age open clusters @xcite .",
    "evidence such as the higher fraction of these stars with circumstellar debris disks , noted above , instead suggest that the @xmath1 boo phenomenon is more common among young a stars .",
    "if true , this would strengthen the case that the internal abundances of these population i stars , at least on average , should be close to solar .",
    "in particular , we note that the existence of @xmath1 boo stars in the orion star forming region implies that their primordial abundances are solar , consistent with other stars in this cluster @xcite .",
    "if the depletion of fe - like elements is restricted to only the outer atmospheres , then one can conclude that in these cases the internal abundances should likewise be solar .    as described in @xcite ,",
    "the space motions of hr 8799 are consistent with those of young stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we investigated this further by comparing the @xmath80 space motions of hr 8799 to those of nearby moving groups assembled in @xcite ; kinematic association with a moving group would not only help constrain the age of the system but also the primordial abundance of the star .",
    "we calculated _ uvw _ space motions using hr 8799 s _ hipparcos _ distance and parallax @xcite , and a radial velocity of @xmath8112.6@xmath21.3 km s@xmath77 from @xcite .",
    "this yielded velocities of _ u = _",
    "@xmath8112.24@xmath20.37 km s@xmath77 , _ v = _",
    "@xmath8121.22@xmath21.10 km s@xmath77 , and _",
    "@xmath817.15@xmath20.86 km s@xmath77 ; these are all within @xmath191 km s@xmath77 of the values reported in @xcite .",
    "figure [ spacemotions ] illustrates the space motion of hr 8799 relative to that of several kinematically similar moving groups after adopting moving group velocities and uncertainties from @xcite .",
    "although the space motion of hr 8799 is not consistent to within 1@xmath53 of any of these groups , it is consistent to within 3@xmath53 of two of these groups : columba ( 1.2@xmath53 ) , and @xmath82 cha ( 2.2@xmath53 ) .",
    "we thus confirm the report by @xcite of the potentially youthful kinematics of hr 8799 , which favors but can not confirm an age less than @xmath83 gyr , and likely a solar abundance consistent with many of these stars .",
    "as described in the introduction , there are two other aspects of hr 8799 that argue for a young age for the star and system .",
    "the strong infrared excess of hr 8799 statistically favors an age less than @xmath84 myr @xcite , despite the challenge raised by @xcite .",
    "an even stronger youthful age restriction is imposed by the dynamical considerations of @xcite .",
    "although their conclusions require use of the predictions of poorly constrained planetary evolutionary models , even considerable uncertainties in the mass estimates require the age of the system to be less than a few 100 myr , otherwise the planets would be too massive to be orbitally stable .",
    "the ages much less than @xmath85 gyr for hr 8799 can only be reconciled if the adopted effective abundances are near solar .",
    "recently , @xcite used the @xmath0 dor - type pulsations of hr 8799 to asteroseismically constrain the star s internal metallicity .",
    "they find a best fit internal metallicity of @xmath86 , assuming that the rotation axis of the star , which affects the rotation speed of the star , is somewhat highly inclined relative to our line of sight ( 50@xmath58 ) .",
    "this high inclination is inconsistent with the more face - on orientation of hr 8799 s disk @xcite and the apparent orbital plane of its companions @xcite , although these need not be coplanar .",
    "the asteroseismology analysis is compromised by the use of an assumed radius that is too small by 8@xmath3 and a temperature that is too hot by 3@xmath3 relative to the precisely determined values in this study .",
    "the measured @xmath87 and @xmath34 presented here will be valuable to constrain the model parameter space in future asteroseismic modeling efforts , which will possibly constrain the internal metallicity .",
    "@xcite do find possible  though less likely  solutions with internal abundances close to solar ( [ fe / h ] @xmath88 ) for closer to pole - on orientations ; this is the most metal - rich metallicity reported in their study .",
    "overall we find the results of this metallicity analysis to be inconclusive primarily because of the large uncertainty in the inclination of the star s rotation axis , which moya et al .",
    "acknowledge is the limiting factor in their analysis .",
    "if anything , the result that they find some acceptable solutions with near solar metallicities and young ages corroborated previous asteroseimology studies of @xmath1 boo stars . using densities inferred from stellar pulsations , @xcite found the location of most @xmath1 boo stars showing @xmath11 scuti pulsations on a plot of average density versus period to be consistent with the positions of @xmath11 scuti stars with solar abundances .",
    "they interpret this as evidence that the low fe - peak abundances are restricted to the surface of @xmath1 boo stars and do not represent the state of the interior composition .",
    "although the variations in hr 8799 are compatible with @xmath0 dor pulsations , the large number of discovered hybrid @xmath11 scu - @xmath0 dor pulsators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , updated by @xcite to account for convective core overshoot .",
    "the models handle convection using mixing length prescription , adopting a mixing length of 1.7432 times the pressure scale height that is set by comparisons with a solar model .",
    "the model uses the solar abundances of @xcite and opal radiative opacities @xcite for the interior and the @xcite opacities for the cooler , outer regions of the star .",
    "additional information regarding the input physics assumed in these models can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , since a set solar metallicity models is not provided , we followed the recommendation of the modelers themselves and generated a set of solar metallicity models by linearly interpolating isochrones and mass tracks between nearest the metallicity models of [ fe / h]=-0.27 dex and [ fe / h ] = + 0.05 dex ( models x74z01 and x71z04 models , respectively ) .",

    "hr 8799 is either contracting onto the zams or expanding from it , and we use the 40 myr isochrone as the upper limit for the age in the pre - main - sequence scenario and as the lower limit for the age in the post - main - sequence scenario . more specifically",
    ", we find that if hr 8799 is contracting onto the zams , it has an age of @xmath8 myr and a mass of @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "if hr 8799 is expanding from the zams , we find it to have an age of @xmath10 myr and a mass of @xmath9 @xmath7 .",
    "these masses and ages are found by interpolating between the solar metallicity models described above .",
    "the masses are consistent with the mass used in @xcite , which was 1.5@xmath20.3 @xmath59 .",
    "we remind the reader that these quoted errors on the star s mass and age are statistical and therefore do not take into account uncertainties in the metallicity and/or models themselves .    with an age of @xmath20 0.1 gyr ,",
    "the companions that hr 8799 harbors are more likely to have planetary masses .",
    "as explained in @xcite , planetary mass objects could only be as bright as these observed companions are if they are young . that inferred age , and",
    "thus companion masses , depends critically upon adopted evolutionary model abundance . while near solar seems likely , even slightly subsolar abundances can give uncertainties in age that extend to above @xmath84 myr , increasing the inferred companion masses by at least a factor of two .",
    "we measured the angular diameter of hr 8799 using the chara array interferometer and used our new value of 0.342@xmath20.008 mas to calculate the star s physical radius ( 1.44@xmath20.06 @xmath4 ) , luminosity ( 5.05@xmath20.29 @xmath5 ) , and effective temperature ( 7193@xmath210 k ) by combining our measurement with information from the literature .",
    "we used our @xmath34 measurement to determine the size of the habitable zone , which is well inside the orbits of any of the companions detected to date .",
    "based on a variety of techniques , we concluded that the most appropriate abundances for hr 8799 are close to solar .",
    "we combined our @xmath87 and @xmath34 values with @xmath90 isochrones to estimate the star s mass and age in two scenarios : @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 if the star is contracting onto the zams or @xmath9 @xmath7 and @xmath10 if it is expanding from it . in either case , this young age implies the imaged companions are planets and not brown dwarfs . the only case in which the companions would be close to brown dwarf mass is",
    "if the highest age of 471 myr was the true case , and even then the masses would be on the exoplanet / brown dwarf cusp .",
