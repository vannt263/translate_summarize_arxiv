    "nanometer - scale precipitates are known to drastically affect mechanical properties of alloys .",
    "accurate characterisation of the size distributions and volume fractions involved through accurate three - dimensional measurements are therefore crucial for establishing structure - property relationships essential for further material development .",
    "such structural information can improve understanding not only of the precipitation kinetics , but also its relation to the strength @xcite , fracture behaviour @xcite and interface structure @xcite .",
    "transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) is traditionally used for analysis of such precipitates in alloys @xcite and has frequently been applied in studies of precipitates in aluminium @xcite and magnesium alloys @xcite in addition to steels @xcite and ni - based superalloys @xcite .",
    "tem stereology involves acquiring projected images of particles ranging from nanometer to micron size in thin foils and using analytical relationships @xcite to deduce particle size , volume fraction and number density etc .",
    "unfortunately , tem is restricted to small volumes and hence low precipitate populations , making it poorly suited for statistical analysis @xcite .",
    "this is primarily due to the limited foil thickness , which is constrained by the need to maintain electron transparency .",
    "the need to minimise overlap in projection can also be problematic for dense particle distributions .",
    "in addition , tem has remained resistant to automation and remains a labour - intensive and time - consuming task .",
    "nanoscale particles are also amenable to characterisation by small - angle scattering ( sas ) , in particular small - angle neutron- and x - ray scattering ( sans and saxs , respectively ) .",
    "sas can characterise nanostructural features with dimensions identical to tem .",
    "the technique has been reviewed by ( amongst others ) fratzl @xcite and kostorz @xcite and its application to alloys is discussed by triolo et al .",
    "some practical benefits of sas are that a minimum of sample preparation is needed @xcite , and that the greater beam diameter and higher penetration depth of neutrons and x - rays probe a vastly larger volume ( typically 1@xmath1 for neutrons and between 10@xmath2m@xmath31mm@xmath4 for x - rays ) , which is more representative of the bulk material .",
    "the main challenge in the application of sas lies in the complex data interpretation required for the extraction of physically meaningful parameters .",
    "this is partially due to the information loss inherent in the collection of sas data but can also be ascribed to the complexities of analysis for anything but the simplest of scattering behaviour @xcite .",
    "it is therefore common to resort to matching the scattering pattern against one of several highly idealised formalisations , with strict assumptions about the nature of the distribution @xcite .",
    "as this work focuses on x - ray scattering , we shall henceforth focus on discussing saxs .",
    "many previous metallurgical saxs studies are therefore focused on cases where the precipitates are essentially globular in shape , spheres being one of the simplest scattering geometries to analyses .",
    "these include studies on guinier - preston zones ( gpz ) in al - zn - mg @xcite and al - ag alloys @xcite , spherical @xmath5 precipitates in al - li alloys @xcite and carbides in carbon steels @xcite .",
    "numerous studies employing a combination of saxs and tem have also concentrated on essentially isotropic scatterers @xcite , or low aspect ratio particles ( e.g. cuboidal precipitates in ni alloys @xcite ) .",
    "the scattered intensity from these scatterers can be considered independent of the crystallographic texture and crystallographic orientation relationship between the matrix and precipitate , greatly simplifying the data analysis .",
    "high - aspect ratio precipitates , however , are of increased interest in the metallurgical field as they can affect the properties much more strongly than globular precipitates can for a given volume fraction .    good studies of high - aspect ratio particles do exist ( see , for example @xcite ) but these are commonly restricted to highly idealised distributions , and it is not uncommon to describe even polydisperse systems using only a single size parameter ( e.g. a `` porod '' radius ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the crystallographic texture and precipitate - matrix orientation relationship will strongly influence scattering from anisotropic particles in polycrystalline samples , but these factors are frequently overlooked .",
    "a practical data interpretation methodology based on a monte - carlo optimisation process has recently been developed , offering a conceptually straightforward determination of _ form - free _ particle size distributions that can be easily extended to support a variety of particle shapes @xcite . given supporting information on the precipitate morphology and orientation ( which tem can provide ) , this method should be able to extract a unique solution for the size distribution of aligned , anisotropic particles .",
    "this work sets out to apply tem and saxs using the monte carlo analysis method for size distribution retrieval in a model system containing non - globular , high - aspect ratio scatterers embedded in a polycrystalline matrix .",
    "key characteristics required in such a model system are : 1 ) a known crystallographic texture , 2 ) a clearly defined precipitate morphology , 3 ) a known crystallographic orientation relationship between the precipitate and matrix , 4 ) a precipitate dimension amenable to both techniques and 5 ) industrial relevance .",
    "magnesium - zinc ( mg - zn ) alloys provide an ideal model system .",
    "as is common with magnesium alloys , mg - zn alloys develop strong texture when extruded .",
    "these alloys derive high strength from a fine dispersion of high aspect - ratio rod - like precipitates ( termed @xmath0 ) aligned parallel to the hexagonal axis of the magnesium matrix @xcite .",
    "these precipitates are the principal contributor to the strength of the alloy and also control the ductility @xcite .",
    "mg - zn alloys also form the basis of the industrial `` zk '' series of alloys and establishing an accurate correlation between the physical properties and the precipitate morphology , size distribution and volume fraction is therefore of practical importance .    in this work ,",
    "a magnesium - zinc alloy is extruded to develop texture and then isothermally aged in order to produce an alloy containing aligned , high - aspect ratio particles .",
    "the @xmath0precipitate size distribution and volume fraction are measured using tem and small - angle x - ray scattering .",
    "tem provides direct information ( size , orientation , morphology etc . ) on a limited number of particles , providing the necessary constraints needed to obtain a unique , physically realistic solution from saxs .",
    "monte carlo saxs analysis subsequently provides bulk values for volume fraction and form - free size distributions .",
    "this multidisciplinary approach is supplemented by electron backscattered diffraction ( ebsd ) to characterise the texture and by microindentation hardness testing to monitor the precipitation strengthening response .",
    "a binary magnesium - zinc alloy was prepared from high - purity elements by direct chill casting .",
    "a composition of mg-3.4at.% zn was measured by atomic emission spectroscopy .",
    "the billet was homogenised at 300@xmath6c for 24h and extruded at 300@xmath6c with an extrusion ratio of 12:1 to form a 12 mm diameter rod .",
    "samples were cut from this rod using a slow - speed diamond saw , encapsulated in argon , solution - treated at 300@xmath6c for 1h and quenched into water at ambient temperature .",
    "the microstructure and texture were examined in the solution - treated condition using light microscopy and electron back scattered diffraction ( ebsd ) .",
    "reflected light micrographs were obtained from ground and polished samples both in cross - section ( i.e. normal to the extrusion direction ( xd ) ) and longitudinal section ( parallel to the xd ) . an acetic - picral etchant was used to highlight the grain boundaries .",
    "the texture of a solution - treated , cross - sectional sample was measured via electron back scattered diffraction ( ebsd ) using a field - emission scanning electron microscope ( fe - sem ) .",

    "the data from this microscope was analysed using oim analysis software , version 6.1 .",
    "the ageing response was examined by microindentation hardness testing .",

    "was then embedded in a low - temperature resin , ground and polished .",
    "the vickers micro indentation hardness was measured using a matsuzawa amt - x7fs automated tester .",
    "each test included a total of 16 measurements per sample using a load of 100 g ( st ) or 200 g ( all other samples ) .",

    "in used this work range from 0h ( not aged , referred to as `` solution treated '' or st ) to 406h ( significantly overaged ) .",
    "the saxs measurements are performed on a laboratory instrument based around a rotating anode generator with a molybdenum target .",
    "mo@xmath7 radiation was selected and focused using an osmic confocal mirror .",
    "the incident beam was further collimated using three pinholes of 0.3 , 0.2 and 0.45 mm in diameter , with the sample positioned immediately after the third pinhole .",
    "the distances from the optics to pinhole # 1 , # 2 and # 3 are 0.115 , 0.582 and 0.86 m , respectively . assuming that the second pinhole is the beam - defining pinhole , the transverse coherence length ( and therefore the maximum size of precipitates contributing to the scattering signal ) is on the order of 200 nm @xcite .",
    "nominal beam diameter at the sample position is estimated to be approximately 200@xmath2 m .",
    "the flightpath is a continuous vacuum from optics to detector .",
    "a dectris pilatus 100k detector is used in combination with a translation stage to detect scattered radiation .",

    "the data correction methodology is detailed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "data is corrected for natural background radiation , transmission , sample thickness , measurement time , primary beam flux , parasitic background , polarisation , detector solid angle coverage and sample self - absorption using in - house developed data reduction software .",
    "deadtime correction is unnecessary at the count rates encountered in this study @xcite , and dead - pixel and flatfield corrections are performed by the detector acquisition software prior to ingestion by the data reduction software @xcite . the intensity is subsequently binned using 200 bins linearly spaced over the aforementioned @xmath13 range , and scaled to absolute units using a calibrated glassy carbon standard @xcite .",
    "statistical uncertainty on the data points is set to the maximum of either : 1 ) the propagated poisson counting statistics , 2 ) the sample standard deviation in the histogram bin , or 3 ) 1% of the intensity in the histogram bin as described in @xcite . as the parasitic scattering is minimal due to complete beam path evacuation ,",
    "improved statistics have been obtained by skewing the time division between sample and background measurement to favour sample measurement time @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the minimal parasitic scattering improves the data accuracy by its reduced sensitivity to inaccuracies in the transmission factor determinations during background subtraction .",

    "assuming the precipitates are composed of equal amounts of mgzn@xmath43 and mg@xmath44zn@xmath45 , the total volume fraction based on the alloy composition and solution treatment temperature is expected to be @xmath170.032 .",
    "tem volume fractions calculations give values close to this ( e.g. 0.035(5 ) for 406h ageing ) in samples where it was possible to tilt the grain to a [ 0001 ] orientation .",
    "precipitate volume fractions measured by saxs are , however , systematically lower than expected from the alloy composition and tem measurements .    the number density of @xmath0precipitates is calculated from the volume fraction and mean ( number - weighted ) precipitate volume and shows similar systematic deviations from values measured via tem . in st condition the number density ( assuming spheroidal scatterers ) is estimated at @xmath68m@xmath69 .",
    "the number density decreases to reach a minimum of @xmath70m@xmath69 after 24h , before increasing to @xmath71m@xmath69 after 48h ageing .",
    "further ageing leads to a gradual decrease in particle number density .",
    "number densities are calculated for tem samples where it is possible to tilt the grain to a [ 0001 ] orientation and are approximately 50 - 60% of the values calculated by saxs , probably due to the discrepancy in the volume fractions .",
    "it has been possible to demonstrate remarkably good agreement between the @xmath0particle sizes ( figure  [ fig - size - evolution ] ) and even the size distributions ( figure  [ fig - saxs - tem ] ) measured via tem and saxs , achieving the main goal of this study .",
    "this result is particularly significant given that oriented particles with a wide range of radii and aspect ratios are present .",
    "however , there is a consistent discrepancy in the volume fractions determined ( and the number densities derived from them ) , however , which needs further consideration .",
    "the reasons for the systematic differences in the volume fraction and number density are not yet clear .",
    "the values from saxs are reliant on the correct determination of a sizeable number of parameters , such as the sample transmission factor and thickness , as well as other calibration factors .",
    "likewise , the volume fraction determined from tem is dependent on accurate thickness determination .",
    "there will be some uncertainty in the scattering factors used since the proportions of mgzn@xmath43 and mg@xmath44zn@xmath45 phases in the precipitates have not been quantified .",
    "however , the phases differ in density by approximately 8% and this would not account the discrepancy in the volume fraction and number density .",
    "the calculations are also contingent on the precipitate geometry and aspect ratio used , and an increase in the aspect ratio leads to a proportional increase in volume fraction ( and corresponding decrease in number density ) .",
    "saxs appears to be more sensitive than tem to particles of radius 1 - 3 nm and it is possible that this can lead to higher number densities of such particles .",
    "the results indicate that @xmath0precipitation involves two distinct stages , one occurring between 06h ageing and the other between 2448h ageing .",
    "the first stage involves a twenty - fold increase in the volume fraction of @xmath0precipitates from @xmath66 to @xmath72 .",
    "this coincides with an increase in the microindentation hardness from 55@xmath52 to 59@xmath52 and relates to the initial precipitation of @xmath0particles .",
    "a second distinct stage occurs between 24h and 48h ageing , during which time the alloy reaches the peak hardness value of @xmath73 .",
    "the number density increases by approximately 25% during this interval , which , combined with a rapid increase in the particle size , sees a rise in the volume of @xmath0precipitates to reach a plateau .",
    "the decline in precipitate number density between 6 and 24h ageing indicates that the increase in hardness over this interval can be ascribed to growth of the existing precipitates rather than further nucleation .",
    "this suggests that @xmath0precipitation is nucleation - limited at 150@xmath6c , consistent with studies that have shown that the ageing process in mg - zn @xcite and mg - zn - y@xcite alloys can be accelerated by introducing microstructural defects through pre - ageing deformation .",
    "in addition to the rod - shaped , @xmath0precipitates , @xmath49 also precipitate during ageing .",
    "these precipitates adopt plate or lath shaped morphologies , with the largest dimension normal to the hexagonal axis .",
    "the appearance of this phase in place of the @xmath0particles is been associated with the loss of mechanical strength during extended heat - treatment ( i.e. overageing ) . scattering from @xmath49 particles",
    "would be registered as that of extremely low length , high radius @xmath0particles ( i.e. aspect ratio @xmath74 ) .",
    "if present in substantial volume fractions this would artificially decrease the average precipitate length and increase the average radius .",
    "however , tem confirms that @xmath49 precipitates observed at ageing times @xmath75h remain a very minor constituent even after 406h ageing at 150@xmath6c , justifying their exclusion from the saxs monte carlo model .",
    "the low number density of @xmath49 precipitates ( roughly one to two orders of magnitude lower than the @xmath0precipitates ) makes quantification of their size and volume fraction infeasible .",
    "however , the observation that the microindentation hardness reached a plateau from 64406h ageing is consistent with this phase having little influence on the microstructure .    in order to highlight the need for tem information in saxs analysis , and to indicate that information on the aspect ratio or even precipitate shape",
    "can not be uniquely identified from standalone saxs , saxs analyses using deviant geometries have been performed .",
    "the monte carlo simulations were repeated assuming _ spheroidal _ scatterers , as well as with rod - like scatterers of aspect ratio 10 , 20 and 30 , to evaluate the effect of changing the modelled precipitate geometry .",
    "these solutions also described the data to within the data uncertainty , reaffirming the need for externally supplied morphological parameters ( e.g. as can be provided by tem ) to generate a unique solution .",
    "the size distributions obtained from matching the scattering from samples aged for 406h with spheres and cylinders of aspect ratio 10 , 20 and 30 are presented in figure  [ fig - aspect - comparison ] .",
    "in general , spherical models give a broader , more skewed size distribution than a cylindrical model .",
    "the spherical model gives a maximum volume fraction of @xmath76 centred at a radius of 7.2 nm .",
    "the three cylindrical models are in good agreement with one another and averaging the fits gives a maximum volume fraction @xmath77 centred at a radius of 6.1 nm .",
    "this demonstrates that , for a cylindrical fitting geometry , a wide range of aspect ratios can fit the scattering within experimental error , and that it is therefore not possible to extract the aspect ratio information from these scattering patterns .",
    "incorrect selection of the modelling geometry may not change the size distribution but can severely affect other calculations such as the volume fraction calculations . when these are based on spheres , they yield volume fractions of approximately half those for the rod - like particles , with a maximum volume fraction of 0.015(3 ) after 406h ageing .",
    "the aspect ratio is also crucial in this case since increasing the aspect ratio used for a cylindrical fit will increase the volume fraction .",
    "this is particularly important since scattering from the long axis of the rods falls outside the range of the present saxs instrument and an inaccurate aspect ratio would not be apparent from saxs measurements alone .",
    "errors such as this could lead to greatly under- or overestimated interparticle distances , which are essential for estimation of the precipitate strengthening effect .    as the precipitate length is beyond the range of most commonly available saxs instruments ,",
    "it is not possible to compare these directly with tem data .    ]      ) it must be possible to measure an anisotropic scattering pattern .",
    "this requires that the material have a non - random crystallographic texture and that the precipitates have a rational orientation to the matrix .",
    "[ fig - anisotropy - chart],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    scattering from anisotropic precipitates in a polycrystalline materials depends not only on the morphology of the precipitate , but on the texture and precipitate habit as well .",
    "precipitates are generally described by a few basic morphologies ( illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig - anisotropy - chart ] ) , which include spheres and cubes ( both described by a single size parameter , radius ( @xmath27 ) ) .",
    "rods , ( described by two parameters : @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath78 and rotational symmetry around @xmath27 ) and plates ( also radially symmetric about @xmath27 but for which @xmath79 ) .",
    "lath - like precipitates are also formed in some systems and require three parameters to describe the size ; @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "the scattered radiation will be isotropic when the scatterers are spherical , or alternatively when the texture is random and/or the precipitates are randomly oriented with respect to the matrix . in the latter two cases it is difficult to distinguish the scattering from that of a distribution of spheres , making it the determination of realistic particle sizes problematic , stressing the need for independent determination of the precipitate morphology .",
    "as noted in section  [ sec - growth ] it is entirely possible to model the saxs intensity to the same degree of accuracy assuming spherical precipitates , producing a mathematically correct , but physically unrealistic solution .",
    "scattering will be anisotropic for high aspect ratio particles in materials with a non - random texture .",
    "this case is widely applicable since anistropic precipitates generally have well - defined orientation relationship between the precipitate and the matrix and defined crystallographic habit .",
    "in addition , most alloys show a non - random texture resulting either from oriented growth or from deformation .",
    "anisotropic scattering makes it possible to extract physically representative particle sizes from high - aspect ratio particles if the relationship between the beam direction and scatters can be clearly defined .",
    "the case of [ 0001 ] rods in extruded mg - zn is relatively straightforward .",
    "as shown in figures  [ fig - ebsd - pf ] and [ fig - sample - geometry ] the combination of specimen orientation , precipitate - matrix orientation and radially symmetric texture ensure that for the majority of grains the long axis ( @xmath27 ) is perpendicular to the beam .",
    "this results in essentially radially isotropic scattering from the @xmath27 component , greatly simplifying the saxs analysis .",
    "it is important to note that the texture is a global average over the sample and if the analysis includes either a few larger grains , or is not locally radially isotropic then streaks can arise from the anisotropy in the orientation of the rods .",
    "if , for example , the x - ray beam was not accurately centred on a radially symmetric sample , it is probable that the scattering would become anistropic .",
    "one approach to combat this issue would be to translate the sample during the saxs measurement , effectively further averaging out any local texture .",
    "even if such larger - scale variations in texture are accounted for it is important to note that the texture is a statistical average and individual grains may diverge from the ideal orientation .",
    "this was accounted in the present work for by including tilting of the rods in the saxs simulation , with the orientation distribution based on a gaussian fit of the ebsd data ( figure  [ fig - ebsd - direction ] ) .",
    "the inclusion of tilting the @xmath0rods out of the radial plane substantially increases the computational burden of the monte carlo fitting procedure and may not be necessary in many cases , particularly in strongly textured materials . in this alloy , which has a maximum texture intensity of @xmath174 , the inclusion of out - of - plane tilting has little effect on the radii distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig - tilt - comparison ] shows the volume - weighted size distributions for mg - zn aged for 406h analysed using a model with and without the consideration of tilt .",
    "the shaded areas represent the standard error of the two methods .",
    "size distributions calculated with and without the consideration of tilting of the rods are shown by circles and diamonds respectively .",
    "there is very good agreement between the two simulations , which differ by considerably less than the standard error .",
    "similar good agreement is found for the size distributions measured at all ageing times .    precipitates .",
    "circles and diamonds indicate the size distributions calculated without including tilting of the @xmath0rods .",
    "the shaded areas represent the standard error of the two methods .",
    "[ fig - tilt - comparison ] ]      the monte carlo saxs method is capable of rapid determination of meaningful three - dimensional information from sample volumes orders of magnitude greater than feasible with tem .",
    "tem particle sizes were based on multiple images of different areas of each foil , with 500 particles measured on average in the [ 0001 ] axis direction and 200 - 300 normal to this direction .",
    "for a beam diameter of 0.2 mm and foil thickness of 0.6 mm the x - ray beam covers a volume of approximately 0.02mm@xmath4 . based on the number density",
    "estimates this encompasses approximately @xmath82 precipitates .",
    "this number can be greatly increased by simply translating the sample during measurement to average over a larger volume of material .",
    "furthermore , saxs can also be used to follow precipitation _ in situ_.    the method presented here is readily applicable to cases where a simple geometric relationship exists between the precipitates and the x - ray beam .",
    "application of this method is more challenging if the precipitates adopt more than one orientation relationship and/or have multiple possible morphologies . while not intractable such complications would make extracting data difficult and necessarily reliant on a detailed understanding of the texture .",
    "precipitate volume fraction measurements via saxs require that the phases be accurately identified , since the scattering cross - section is determined by the electron density of the scatterers .",
    "difficulties may occur due to the presence of additional phases with different compositions , or if a single phase exists over a broad composition range . in this instance , @xmath0particles have been widely reported and well characterised in mg - zn based alloys @xcite and although the composition could feasibly range between mg@xmath44zn@xmath45 and mgzn@xmath43 the overall effect on the scattering is minor . in the case of unknown or poorly - characterised phases",
    "the precipitates present should be identified from bulk x - ray diffraction or other techniques .",
    "in contrast , tem measurements are determined from the area fraction in projection , but suffer from greater statistical uncertainty due to the inherently microscopic analysis volumes .",
    "a final limitation on the present analysis concerns the particle size range of the saxs instrument , which can only collect x - rays scattered from particles up to 35 nm in radius . overcoming this restriction",
    "would greatly enhance the potential for monte carlo analysis of saxs from high aspect ratio particles . with this objective in mind .",
    "a purpose - built ultra - saxs apparatus is currently under construction at our institute which would extend the range of particle sizes up to about @xmath83 m .",
    "this instrument will greatly extend the utility of saxs particle size measurements , making it possible not only to measure large isotropic particles but also to simultaneously measure two size parameters in high aspect ratio precipitates .",
    "the nanoscale precipitation behaviour of a mg - zn alloy has been examined in detail , made easy through complementary tem and saxs .",
    "the method presented here obtains quantitative size distributions and internally consistent volume fractions and number densities of non - globular , high - aspect ratio precipitates and takes into account both the precipitate orientation and texture .",
    "accurate analysis by saxs was contingent upon relating the orientation of the bulk sample to that of the principal scattering sites , which was achieved through texture measurement of an extruded sample via ebsd and subsequent determination of the precipitate morphology and habit using tem .",
    "this provided the information necessary for saxs analysis through monte carlo fitting , yielding a quantified precipitate size distribution and volume fraction for the anisotropic rod - like precipitates .",
    "samples aged at 150@xmath6c contained rod - like @xmath0precipitates , with the size , number density and volume fraction of particles increasing with ageing time .",
    "the size distributions determined through tem and saxs analysis were in very good agreement for ageing times between 6 and 406h .",
    "the precipitate volume fraction underwent an order of magnitude increase during initial ageing ( 0 - 6h ageing ) with a further 16% increase between 24h and 48h ageing .",
    "the later increase was coupled with an increase in the particle number density of approximately 25% , indicating that further @xmath0nucleation occurred in this interval .",
    "extended ageing did not result in a deterioration of the hardness and the alloy retained values within experimental error of the peak value up to 406h .",
    "this is consistent with the findings that ageing at this temperature does not result in formation of significant amounts of plate - shaped @xmath49 precipitates ."
