    "recently , a general dynamical renormalization group ( rg ) scheme @xcite has been proposed in order to treat nonequilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "the method , called dynamically driven renormalization group ( ddrg ) , has been applied to self - organized critical phenomena , specifically to critical height sandpile models @xcite and forest fire models @xcite .",
    "its phenomenological approach takes into account the nature of self - organized systems through an attractive fixed point .",
    "the scheme also provides numerical values for the critical exponents which are close to the ones obtained using computer simulations .",
    "the scheme consists in coupling a real space rg scheme to a stationary condition that drives the rg group equations through the parameter space .",
    "the stationary conditions , involving the stationary distribution , must always be approximated . while the authors used a stationary probability distribution that neglects any correlation among different sites , they have mentioned @xcite the fact that using more refined approximations should improve the values of the critical exponents .    while the ddrg scheme is quite general ,",
    "self - organized critical systems are special since they have a well defined time scale separation ( dissipation events being instantaneous with respect to the driving ) .",
    "this prevents proliferation effects in the real space rg , making the calculation of critical exponents easier .    in this work",
    ", we implemented the ddrg scheme to another class of systems namely the class of driven diffusive systems with an absorbing state ( the vacuum state ) . due to the presence of one absorbing state",
    "this class of systems is in the same universality as the directed percolation model @xcite @xcite .",
    "more precisely we have considered one - dimensional probabilistic cellular automata with one absorbing state .",
    "we have treated two types of models .",
    "one of them is a two - state probabilistic cellular automaton ( that can be interpreted as directed percolation in two dimensions ) that includes , in the limit of small transition probabilities , as particular cases , continuous - time processes with one absorbing state such as the contact model @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the other one is a four - state probabilistic cellular automaton that includes the model introduced by grassberger and de la torre @xcite as a particular case .",
    "the appropriate real space rg parameter space for these nonequilibrium models is the space of the transition probabilities , instead of being the space of coupling constants as is the case of equilibrium models , defined by a hamiltonian . in the case of the models studied here , with one absorbing state",
    ", the rg should be appropriate to preserve the vacuum state along the rg trajectory in this parameter space . by using a block renormalization to treat properly the absorbing state we have figured the value of the critical exponent corresponding to the divergence of the spatial correlation , @xmath0 , using three different approximations which consider correlations among clusters up to @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 neighboring sites in the lattice , respectively .",
    "our best calculations give @xmath4 which is rather close to the one obtained from numerical simulations reported in @xcite namely @xmath5",
    "the first model is a one - dimensional cellular automaton with just two state per site .",
    "each site can be either vacant , @xmath6 or occupied by a particle , @xmath7 at each time step the state of a certain site will depend only on the previous states of that same site and its nearest neighbors .",
    "we consider the most general transition probabilities that are homogeneous and symmetric in space .",
    "the transition probability @xmath8 to state @xmath9 will be given by the product @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of sites and @xmath12 is the one - site transition probability given by the rules @xmath13    the rule @xmath14 implies that the vacuum state is indeed an absorbing state .",
    "when @xmath15 we say that the annihilation of particles is spontaneous .",
    "suppose moreover that @xmath16 and that the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are very small . in this case",
    "the system remains most of the time in its previous state .",
    "we expect , therefore , that the properties of the present two - state model , in the limit @xmath19 and @xmath20 with the ratio @xmath21 fixed , be identical to the contact process with a catalytic transition rate equal to @xmath22 and a transition rate for spontaneous annihilation equal to unity . if @xmath23 and taking the same limit , the properties will be identical to a model introduced by dickman ( model a ) @xcite .",
    "the model is represented by a set of five parameters , @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 which constitutes , as we shall see , the rg parameter space .",
    "the rg scheme will be constructed in a way that the rg trajectory will be confined to this space .",
    "grassberger and the la torre model @xcite is defined as follows .",
    "each site of a one - dimensional lattice is either occupied by one particle or it is void . at a certain time",
    "step the state of the system may be defined by the vector @xmath29 where @xmath30 or @xmath1 according whether the site @xmath31 is vacant or occupied . in each time step , all sites are updated in two stages .    * in the first stage each particle is spontaneously annihilated with probability @xmath32 . * in the second stage every surviving particle will generate , with probability @xmath33 a new ( unique ) particle , which will be placed in one of its nearest neighboring sites , randomly chosen . in other words",
    ", for each site with a particle , we chose a neighboring site with probability @xmath34 .",
    "if the site was originally void it becomes occupied , and if it was occupied it remains as such .",
    "we have modified slightly the original model by introducing the parameter @xmath35 the original model of grassberger and de la torre is recast when @xmath36 .    defined in this way ,",
    "the transition probability @xmath37 from a state @xmath38 , to another state @xmath39 , can not be written as a product of independent transition probabilities associated to each site @xmath40 , as in ordinary cellular automaton .",
    "however , if we enlarge the number of states in each site by introducing three types of particle , then it is possible to map the model into a four - state cellular automata .",
    "this mapping is outlined in appendix a.    the four - state probabilistic cellular automaton equivalent to grassberger and de la torre model is defined as follows",
    ". each site of a one - dimensional lattice can be either empty ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath6 or occupied by a neutral particle ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath42 or by a rightist particle ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 or by a leftist particle ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 at each time step , every site of the lattice is independently updated according to the rules .    *",
    "if the site is occupied by one particle of any type @xmath11 , @xmath43 , or @xmath45 , then one out of four possible events will take place . * * the particle is annihilated , that is , the site becomes empty , with probability @xmath32 , or * * becomes a particle of type @xmath11 with probability @xmath47 , or * * becomes a particle of type @xmath43 with probability @xmath48 , or * * becomes a particle of type @xmath45 with probability @xmath48 . + here @xmath49 and @xmath50 * in case the site is empty ( state @xmath41 ) one has to look to its neighboring sites . * * if its left neighbor is type @xmath43 or its right neighbor is of type @xmath45 , the site remains as @xmath41 with probability @xmath32 , becomes @xmath11 with probability @xmath51 , becomes @xmath43 with probability @xmath48 , or becomes @xmath45 with probability @xmath52 . * * if on the contrary , its left nearest neighbor is not a particle of type @xmath43 and is right nearest neighbor is not of type @xmath45 , the site remains vacant .",
    "this last rule implies that the state with all sites empty is an absorbing state .",
    "transition probability @xmath53 from state @xmath54 to state @xmath55 can be written as the product @xmath56 where @xmath11 is the number of sites of the lattice .",
    "the one - site transition probability @xmath40 is written down in the appendix a.    in order to apply the rg scheme we enlarge the space of parameters but preserve the existence of the absorbing state . demanding besides that the rules should be homogeneous in space and invariant by exchanging the states @xmath43 and @xmath57 the transition probability @xmath12 will be defined in the most general way by @xmath58 parameters .",
    "we call such a probabilistic cellular automaton the four - state model .",
    "here we use a real space rg scheme @xcite which renormalizes the transition probability @xmath59 the succession of rg transformations corresponds to a trajectory in the space spanned by the parameters that defines @xmath59 the scheme we use is an implementation of the ddrg @xcite and is accomplished by transforming cells of @xmath60 sites into a cell of just one site . to treat the vacuum state properly any cell with at least one particle",
    "renormalizes into an occupied site . only cells with no particles",
    "renormalizes into a vacant site .",
    "let @xmath61 be a condition probability of state @xmath62 given the state @xmath39 with the following properties @xmath63 the vector @xmath55 represents the state of a system with @xmath11 degrees of freedom and the vector @xmath64 represents the state of the renormalized system with @xmath65 degrees of freedom , where @xmath60 is the size of the renormalization block .",
    "let @xmath66 be the probability of occurrence of state @xmath38 at a given time and state @xmath39 at @xmath67 time steps later , that is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the stationary probability distribution which satisfies the equation @xmath70 for any value of @xmath67 , where @xmath71 is the transition probability from state @xmath38 to state @xmath39 in @xmath72 time steps .",
    "similarly , for the renormalized system , let @xmath73 be the probability of occurrence of state @xmath74 at a given time and state @xmath62 at one time step later . the rg transformation",
    "are obtained by demanding that @xcite @xmath75 from which follows @xmath76 since @xmath77    to get the desired renormalized transition probability @xmath78 and equations ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) , and ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xcite @xmath79 this equation , however , is not properly a transformation between the transition probabilities @xmath80 and @xmath81 , since the yet unknown stationary probability @xmath69 appears in the right hand side of equation ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "however , if we use the balance equation ( [ 6 ] ) for @xmath69 then a closure condition for the renormalization group is obtained .",
    "the closure condition plays the role of the driving condition that forces the system to be in the stationary state at each step of the transformation . in this sense",
    "the present ddrg may be thought of as a renormalization of the stationary state .    at each state of the transformation",
    "the transition probability @xmath80 always describes an irreversible process so that the corresponding stationary solution @xmath69 obtained from the closure condition ( [ 6 ] ) will not be related , a priori , to a hamiltonian , that would be the case if the process obeyed detailed balance . in this way",
    "the present rg scheme is distinct from the ordinary real space rg used in equilibrium systems in which the parameters of the hamiltonian are renormalized .",
    "the closure relation ( [ 6 ] ) , however , can not actually be solved so that approximations should be used .",
    "here we have used three different approximations which consider correlations among clusters up to @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 neighboring sites . equation ( [ 11 ] ) together with a given approximation provides then a well defined rg transformation @xmath82 .    assuming that the renormalized transition probability can also be written as a product of independent transition probabilities , that is , @xmath83 one can write the rg equations that relates the old one - site transition probability @xmath40 to the new one @xmath84    we have used only renormalization cells with size @xmath85 and chosen @xmath86 in the form @xmath87 with @xmath88 to preserve the absorbing nature of the vacuum state we have chosen @xmath43 with the properties @xmath89 and @xmath90 whenever @xmath91 or @xmath92    for the four - site model we used the following values @xmath93 the other matrix elements of @xmath43 are zero .",
    "the first matrix element has been chosen in order to preserve the absorbing nature of the vacuum state and the rest of the elements where assigned bearing in mind the physical picture that an @xmath43 particle will give rise to a new particle to the right in the next time step , while an @xmath45 particle will generate a new particle to the left ( @xmath11 particles will not generate new particles ) .",
    "the temporal coarse graining will be done using two time steps that is @xmath94 using the equations of the previous section we can write down the equation that relates @xmath95 to @xmath96 for the case @xmath97 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100}^{-1}\\times \\nonumber \\\\   & &   r(\\tau _ 2|\\sigma _ 7,\\sigma _ 8) r(\\tau _",
    "3|\\sigma _ 9,\\sigma _ { 10 } ) r(\\tau _ 4|\\sigma _ { 11},\\sigma _ { 12})\\times \\nonumber \\\\   & & p(\\sigma _ 7,\\sigma _ 8,\\sigma _ 9,\\sigma _ { 10},\\sigma _ { 11},\\sigma _ { 12 } ) ^{\\mbox{\\ } } , \\label{33}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 here the subscripts refer to the site numbers appearing in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "in order to solve the system of equations ( [ 31]-[34 ] ) one must resort on approximate methods to estimate the stationary weights @xmath102 the simplest approximation , sometimes known as simple mean field approximation , consists in neglecting correlations among different sites    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is the solution of @xmath105    however , correlations are actually taken into account in the geometrical aspects of the blocking procedure . in this way",
    ", one obtains non classical critical exponents .",
    "given a blocking prescription , the value of the critical exponents should improve as correlations are taken into account into the stationary probability distribution . in order to verify how important the changes will be ,",
    "we have used three different approximations for the stationary distribution .",
    "the first one being ( [ 41]-[42 ] ) , while the other two are mean field approximations which consider correlations up to clusters of three sites and five sites respectively @xcite .    due to the number of terms involved in equations ( [ 31]-[34 ] ) it is not possible to determine analytically the fixed point of the transformation .",
    "so , we have performed it numerically , using initial values for the transition probabilities corresponding to the model of interest . in the case of the two - state model",
    "we start with @xmath106 given by ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in the case of the four - state model",
    "we start with @xmath107 corresponding to the grassberger and de la torre model , with @xmath36 .    in each iteration of the rg ,",
    "given the set of parameters @xmath96 , one has to find the stationary solution for @xmath108 .",
    "this has been done by iterating the time evolution equation for the model ( using one of the three approximations ) until reaching convergence .",
    "for the one - site approximation , given by ( [ 42 ] ) , @xmath109 iterations were enough .",
    "as approximations are refined equations become highly nonlinear , and for the five - site approximation least @xmath110 iterations are needed .",
    "for the four - state model , the rg equations behaved in the following way . for small values of @xmath32 ,",
    "the set of transition matrix elements flows towards an attractive fixed point characterized by @xmath111 , and a lattice full of particles . on the contrary , for values of @xmath32 high enough ,",
    "the rg equations are driven to a different attractive fixed point , this time characterized by @xmath112 and a lattice without particles . in this case",
    "we used only the one - site approximation and found a critical value of @xmath32 given by @xmath113 starting around this values the representative point of the parameter set spends a long time near an unstable point before it leaves towards any of the two attractive fixed points .",
    "figure 2 shows a projection of two trajectories in the parameter space in terms of two of these parameters : @xmath114 and @xmath115 .    in this way",
    ", it is found only one relevant parameter .",
    "since we are dealing only with stationary properties of the model it is reasonable to assume that this parameter is associated to the divergence of the spatial correlation length and not to the temporal correlation length .",
    "so , figuring the eigenvalue @xmath116 associated to that parameter we get @xmath117 .",
    "the value measured numerically is @xmath118 .    from computer simulations results reported in @xcite",
    "one can obtain @xmath119 , and the critical value of @xmath32 is @xmath120 .",
    "the discrepancy between the two results are mainly due to the poorness of the one - site approximation . by increasing the order of approximation the results",
    "gets better as we shall see in the case of the two - site model .",
    "we have corroborated that , as one would expect , the value of @xmath121 for the simpler two - state model and one - site approximation is identical as the one previously found . since for refined approximations of three and five sites ,",
    "numerical computations become too imposing , we have used these two better approximations only for the two - state model .",
    "the value found using the three - site approximation was @xmath122 whereas the value found in the five - site approximation was @xmath4 , which is rather close to the one calculated from numerical simulations .",
    "bellow we show the coordinates of the unstable fixed point for the three approximations , as well as the corresponding value of @xmath116 @xmath123 another advantage in using better approximations is the improvements one obtains in the critical values of non - universal parameters .",
    "we have consider the following initial conditions for the two - state model : @xmath15 and @xmath124 by varying @xmath17 and @xmath18 we have obtained the critical values @xmath125 of the ratio @xmath126 as shown in the table @xmath127 which , in the limit @xmath128 should be compared with the critical value of the contact process @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the column associated to @xmath130 also seems to converge to this value is a mere coincidence .",
    "reasoning along this line , one may wonder why not to use the stationary distribution directly from a computer simulation of the model . making large statistics over configurations in the stationary regime",
    ", one should be able to accurately estimate the probabilities of the clusters appearing on the left hand side of equations ( [ 33 ] ) and ( [ 34 ] ) .",
    "while the idea is in principle right , one can not overcome in practice the huge amount of time needed to obtain values that are accurate enough .",
    "slight fluctuations in the estimated values will make trajectories randomly shift their destination towards one of the two attractive fixed points , depending on the random seed used in the simulation .",
    "this effect takes place even before any trajectory is able to reach the linearized domain of the transformation around the unstable point .",
    "a way to decrease fluctuations is increasing the size of the lattice in which one performs the simulation .",
    "but the precision one gains does not grow faster than @xmath131 , where @xmath11 is the size of the lattice .",
    "we have applied a real space renormalization group scheme to a class of driven diffusive probabilistic cellular automata having one absorbing state .",
    "two models having been considered .",
    "one of them is a two - state model that reduces to the contact process in the limit of small transition probabilities .",
    "the two - state model can also be interpreted as a generic directed percolation in two dimensions .",
    "the other is a four - state models that includes the model introduced by grassberger and de la torre in a study related to the contact process .",
    "we have found , in the rg space of parameters , just one non - trivial unstable fixed point with one relevant direction .",
    "the existence of just this unique fixed point reveals that the probabilistic cellular automata with one absorbing state belongs to the same universality class as the directed percolation and the contact process , as expected .",
    "the implementation of the rg scheme nedeed the calculation of the stationary probability distribution which were performed in several levels of approximations . increasing the number of cluster size used in the approximation improved results were obtained not only for the critical exponent @xmath132 as well as for the non - universal critical quantities .",
    "the grassberger and de la torre model is a stochastic process in which at each time step particles are being created and annihilated .",
    "we imagine the process as a sequence os states @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136 each one being given by a vector @xmath137 where @xmath138 or @xmath1 according whether site @xmath31 is vacant or occupied by a particle .",
    "we may think of each transition , say @xmath139 as composed of three stages with two intermediate states @xmath140 and @xmath141 to be defined shortly , so that the whole stochastic process corresponds to a sequence @xmath133 @xmath142 @xmath141 @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath135 @xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148",
    "we will then write the transition probability @xmath149 from state @xmath150 to @xmath151 as given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the intermediate transition probabilities related to the three stages .    _ first stage_. in the first stage ( @xmath156 ) of the grassberger and de la torre model , each particle is annihilated with probability @xmath32 , so that the probability @xmath155 of the transition from @xmath150 to @xmath140 is given by @xmath157 where @xmath158 _ second stage_. in this stage ( @xmath159 ) every particle decides whether it will generate new particles either to the left or to the right in the next step .",
    "each occupied site will be labeled according to its decision . a particle that decides not to generate particles",
    "will be labeled by the number @xmath160 a particle that decides to generate another one to the right , will be labeled by the number @xmath161 and a particle that decides to generate a new particle to the left , will be labeled by the number @xmath2 .",
    "a state of type @xmath162 is then defined by the vector @xmath163 where @xmath164 so that the transition probability @xmath165 of the transition from @xmath140 to @xmath162 is given by @xmath166 where @xmath167    _ third stage_. in this state ( @xmath168 ) , particles are effectively created .",
    "each occupied site remains occupied .",
    "each vacant site becomes occupied if the site at right ( left ) is occupied by a particle of type @xmath2 ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "a  configuration of type @xmath151 is expressed again in terms of the two state variables , @xmath138 or @xmath1 , and the transition probability @xmath169 of the transition from @xmath162 to @xmath151 is given by @xmath170 where the transition probability @xmath171 to the state @xmath172 is given by @xmath173 if @xmath174 for any value of @xmath175 and @xmath176 and @xmath177 if @xmath178 or @xmath179 in other cases @xmath180 vanishes .",
    "the transition probability @xmath181 to the state @xmath182 is just given by @xmath183    it ease to check that @xmath184 can not be written as product of independent transition probability of each site as in an ordinary cellular automaton .",
    "however , the transition probability @xmath185 from state @xmath162 to state @xmath186 can . indeed , from @xmath187 that is from @xmath188 we get @xmath189 which can be written in the form @xmath190 where @xmath191    the grassberger and de la torre process can then be viewed as sequence of states @xmath141 @xmath145 @xmath147 @xmath192 , each one being given by a vector @xmath193 where @xmath6 @xmath194 @xmath195 or @xmath2 according whether site @xmath31 is either vacant , or occupied by a particle that does not generate another particle ( neutral particle ) , or occupied by a particle that generates another one to the right ( a rightist particle ) or occupied by a particle that generates another one to the left ( a leftist particle ) .",
    "therefore , it is equivalent to an ordinary four - state cellular automaton whose rules are defined by equations ( [ a14 ] ) , ( [ a3 ] ) , ( [ a5 ] ) , and ( [ a7]-[a8 ] ) . from these equations",
