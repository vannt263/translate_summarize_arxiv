    "thompson s group @xmath1 has a number of perplexing properties .",
    "these include a wide range of unusual geometric properties , both on the large scale and the local scale .",
    "these have been studied by a number of authors . here , we develop a geometric understanding of the automorphism group of @xmath1 .",
    "the algebraic structure of @xmath0 was described by brin @xcite via a short exact sequence involving the subgroup of inner automorphisms of @xmath1 together with the product of two copies of thompson s group @xmath2 .",
    "the geometric structure of @xmath0 is related to the geometric description of the commensurator of @xmath1 , developed in burillo , cleary and rver @xcite . here",
    ", we describe @xmath0 in terms of periodic infinite tree pair diagrams .",
    "these descriptions lead to a natural presentation for @xmath0 as well as some effective estimates for word length in @xmath0 in terms of the complexity of their eventually periodic tree pair diagrams .",
    "we estimate the word length as a function of the size of the periodic part of the diagrams , together with the size of a remaining non - periodic part .",
    "there are several natural subgroups to consider of @xmath0 arising naturally via brin s algebraic description as a short exact sequence .",
    "we consider several such subgroups , giving geometric descriptions of them and their presentations .",
    "we estimate the word length in these subgroups and compute the exact distortion to be quadratic in @xmath0 of the simplest one of these subgroups .",
    "the construction shows that @xmath1 itself is quadratically distorted in the most natural of ways in which it lies in @xmath0 , as the subgroup of inner automorphisms .",
    "in contrast , there are many other ways in which @xmath1 lies as a subgroup in @xmath0 and in some of those cases , we show that it is undistorted .",
    "thompson s group @xmath1 is typically defined as a group of homeomorphisms of the unit interval .",
    "elements of @xmath1 are maps @xmath3\\longrightarrow [ 0,1]\\ ] ] which satisfy    1 .",
    "they are orientation - preserving homeomorphisms , 2 .",
    "they are piecewise - linear , with finitely many breakpoints ( points where the linear slope changes ) , 3 .",
    "all breakpoints are dyadic integers ( lying in @xmath4\\cap \\zz[\\frac12]$ ] ) , 4 .",
    "all slopes of the linear parts are powers of 2 .    for an introduction to @xmath1 , and proofs of its most important properties ,",
    "see cannon , floyd and parry @xcite .",
    "thompson s group @xmath2 is defined in a completely analogous way as @xmath1 , but the homeomorphisms are defined on the circle @xmath5 instead of the unit interval .",
    "we usually interpret elements of @xmath2 also as maps of the interval but with the endpoints identified , and then we can also think of them as piecewise - linear , having dyadic breakpoints , etc .",
    "hence , @xmath1 is a subgroup of @xmath2 . again , see @xcite for details .",
    "to study the group of automorphisms of @xmath1 , it is convenient to introduce the group @xmath6 .",
    "this group is the group of piecewise - linear homeomorphisms of the real line which have also dyadic breakpoints and power - of - two slopes , but whose set of breakpoints can be infinite , but discrete .",
    "thompson s group @xmath1 can be seen as a group of homeomorphisms of the real line as well , instead of @xmath4 $ ] , by conjugating elements with the suitable map ( see figure [ conjmap ] ) . even though it seems that this conjugation could introduce an infinite number of breakpoints , it is easy to see that it does not .",
    "the slope @xmath7 near 0 , for instance , results in translation by @xmath8 near @xmath9 when conjugated into the real line .",
    "hence , @xmath1 is seen as a subgroup of @xmath6 , as those elements which satisfy the following property : there exists a real number @xmath10 , and two integers @xmath11 such that    1 .   for all @xmath12",
    ", we have @xmath13 2 .   for all @xmath14",
    ", we have @xmath15    in particular , this implies that all breakpoints are within the interval @xmath16 $ ] and hence the set of breakpoints is finite .     from @xmath4 $ ] to the real line.,width=480 ]    the group @xmath6 is the group where all the action will be contained .",
    "brin @xcite , shows that the group @xmath6 acts as a natural setting for these studies , showing that the automorphism groups of both thompson s group @xmath1 and its commutator subgroup are subgroups of @xmath6 :    ( brin @xcite ) for a subgroup @xmath17 , let @xmath18 be its normalizer in @xmath6 , that is , all those elements in @xmath6 which conjugate @xmath19 to itself .",
    "then we have :    1 .",
    "@xmath20 2 .",
    "@xmath21    this theorem is what allows us to investigate the automorphism group of @xmath1 as a subgroup of @xmath6 , where a piecewise linear map acts on @xmath1 by conjugation .",
    "that is , the group of automorphisms of @xmath1 is isomorphic to those elements in @xmath6 which conjugate @xmath1 to itself .",
    "we note that @xmath6 has an index two subgroup , which we will denote @xmath22 , of those maps in @xmath6 which preserve the orientation .",
    "a natural representative of the reversing coset is the map @xmath23 . the same way , the group of automorphisms of @xmath1 has also a subgroup @xmath24 , also preserving orientation . since in both cases the subgroup has index two",
    ", we will restrict our study to the orientation - preserving automorphisms , noting that @xmath1 is actually included in @xmath22 .",
    "the key characteristic of the elements of @xmath1 inside @xmath22 is the fact that near infinity , they are translations by integers . the two integers @xmath8 and @xmath25 which exist for each element of @xmath1 give precisely the abelianization map for @xmath1 ( see cannon , floyd and parry @xcite ) .",
    "then , the commutator @xmath26 is given by the elements which are the identity near infinity . this shows that @xmath26 is exactly the subgroup of @xmath22 of those elements which have bounded support ; that is , those which are the identity outside a bounded interval .",
    "this gives an idea of why the automorphism group of @xmath26 is the whole @xmath6 .",
    "see brin s paper @xcite for details .    to see which elements of @xmath22 conjugate @xmath1 to itself",
    ", we note that the condition where @xmath13 , for @xmath12 , and the fact that all integers appear somewhere , forces a conjugating element @xmath27 to satisfy @xmath28 , also for sufficiently large @xmath29 .",
    "the counterpart in @xmath9 also means that this same condition is satisfied on the other side .",
    "hence an element @xmath30 must satisfy @xmath28 outside of some bounded interval .",
    "finally , if we consider a map @xmath27 on @xmath31 which satisfies @xmath28 , it descends into @xmath5 seen as @xmath32 , so it corresponds to a map of @xmath5 .",
    "this means that to an element of @xmath24 we can assign two elements of @xmath2 , one given by the behavior near @xmath33 and another one near @xmath9 ( which have no interaction among them , and hence , commute ) .",
    "this fact is summarized in the following structure theorem for @xmath24 , proved by brin in @xcite .",
    "( brin @xcite )    1 .",
    "the group @xmath24 is exactly the subgroup of @xmath22 given by those elements @xmath27 for which there exists @xmath10 such that @xmath28 , for all @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "we have a short exact sequence @xmath35    in this paper , we introduce an interpretation for @xmath24 given by binary trees analogous to the one for @xmath1 , use it to construct a presentation for it , describe some interesting subgroups for @xmath24 , and study the large - scale metric properties of some of these subgroups .",
    "elements of thompson s group @xmath1 can be represented using a pair of binary trees to encode the subdivisions of the unit interval needed to construct the piecewise - linear map in a standard way . by `` caret '' of a rooted binary tree , we mean an internal node together with",
    "its two downward directed edges .",
    "each caret represents a subdivision of an appropriate subinterval into two halves , which are its children .",
    "that way , a binary tree represents a subdivision of the interval .",
    "two trees with the same number of leaves represent an element of @xmath1 , by mapping the leaf subintervals linearly in an order - preserving way .",
    "the carets are naturally ordered from left to right , according to the order of the subintervals they represent in @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "see figure [ caretorder ] for an example .        our goal is to extend this representation to elements of @xmath36 , and even to the whole @xmath6 . since according to the previous section ,",
    "elements of @xmath36 are represented by piecewise - linear maps on the line instead of @xmath4 $ ] , we need to clarify how pairs of binary trees will correspond to maps of the real line .",
    "if we consider the conjugation map which relates the interval to the line , we see how to construct this representation .",
    "the carets located on the right and left branches of a tree , represent the main intervals which appear in the conjugating map , see figure [ conjmap ] .",
    "hence , these carets will represent integer intervals of length one in the real line representation , with the exception of the leftmost and rightmost carets which represent intervals to @xmath9 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "see figure [ realtree ] .",
    "so we are now considering infinite binary trees ( with infinitely many leaves ) .",
    "we need a mark on the two trees to signal a reference starting point . in this way , each element of @xmath6 can be represented by a pair of ( possibly infinite ) binary trees with a marking .",
    "elements of @xmath1 correspond to those for which only finitely many of the unit integer intervals are subdivided , and hence the trees are finite with the exception of the right and left  tails . \" see figure [ realelement ] for an example .",
    "the choice of marking is arbitrary ; there are many marked diagrams representing the same element .",
    "we note that it is possible to represent the whole @xmath36 by indicating some orientations with the markings .",
    "however , here we will restrict our consideration to the orientation - preserving subgroup @xmath24 of index two for simplicity .",
    "but now seen as a pair of trees encoding the map of the real line . here",
    "we see : the element in @xmath4 $ ] , then the same element in @xmath31 , and in the third picture the dotted carets represent the tails that have been added.,width=480 ]    in the particular case for @xmath36 , the pairs of trees have to be periodic .",
    "the condition @xmath28 means that whatever subdivision we have in the interval @xmath38 $ ] , for @xmath39 sufficiently large , it must repeat in the following intervals .",
    "hence , the infinite trees representing elements of @xmath36 can be coded in a finite way , because from some point on , the trees are periodic .",
    "this leads to the following definition .",
    "an _ eventually periodic binary tree _ is a subtree of the infinite binary tree , for which there exists an integer @xmath40 such that all intervals @xmath38 $ ] , for @xmath41 have the same subdivision ; and also , all intervals @xmath42 $ ] , for @xmath41 also have the same subdivision .",
    "the subdivision for the intervals near infinity ( the same for all ) is not necessarily the same as the one for the intervals near @xmath9 .",
    "see figure [ evperiodic ] for an example of an eventually periodic element .",
    "the trees are infinite , but only at the two extremes , and that each integer interval is subdivided only finitely many times .",
    "hence the breakpoints form a discrete subset . and",
    "the fact that the trees are eventually periodic means that for each tree , the right and left tails are periodic .",
    "since now the trees are infinite , we need a marking to indicate how the leaves are mapped to each other . the marking ( unoriented in the case of @xmath24 )",
    "is given by a little circle in a leaf in each tree .",
    "then , those two leaves are mapped to each other , and the corresponding leaves are mapped in order - preserving way .     +    it is straightforward to verify that conjugating an element of @xmath1 by an eventually periodic tree , the result is another element of @xmath1 .",
    "the tails get cancelled because they are identical and give redundant subdivisions , capable of being reduced .",
    "each orientation - preserving automorphism of @xmath1 can be represented by an eventually periodic map of @xmath31 , and hence by a pair of eventually periodic trees .",
    "the map from @xmath24 to @xmath43 can be read off directly from the infinite tree .",
    "the map is given by the trees which subdivide in both tails .",
    "see figure [ tcrosst ] for the element of @xmath2 corresponding to the left tail for the element of figure [ evperiodic ] .",
    "we note that we are restriction to the binary case ; the generalizations @xmath44 of thompson s group @xmath1 have much more complicated automorphism groups ; see brin and guzman @xcite .    .",
    "the two trees enclosed with a dotted line are the ones repeating indefinitely down the tail , and the two leaves marked with an asterisk map to each other ( they are both at distance three from the marking ) .",
    "the resulting element of @xmath2 is constructed with these two trees , and is represented on the bottom.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +",
    "the short exact sequence @xmath35 can be used to compute a presentation for @xmath24 .",
    "we can use the standard presentation for @xmath1 given by @xmath45,[x_0x_1\\ii , x_0^{-2}x_1x_0 ^ 2]{\\rangle}.\\ ] ] a standard finite presentation for @xmath2 , given in cannon , floyd and parry @xcite , supplements the two generators @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath1 with a new generator @xmath48 , which is an element of order 3 . in our case , we will choose a different torsion element , denoted by @xmath49 , which is diagrammatically smaller and easier to lift to @xmath24 and is also used in burillo , cleary , stein and taback @xcite .",
    "the two elements @xmath48 and @xmath49 are depicted in figure [ tgens ] , and note that they satisfy the relation @xmath50 . using this relation and the presentation for @xmath2 given in @xcite , it is easy to see that @xmath2 is generated by @xmath51 and @xmath49 and with the following relators , which are labelled for future reference :    .",
    "the element @xmath48 is used as a generator in @xcite , and the element @xmath49 is used here.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    1 .   @xmath52 $ ] 2 .   @xmath53 $ ] 3 .",

    "@xmath56 6 .",
    "@xmath57 .",
    "since we are using @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the @xmath1 embedding in @xmath24 , the two lifts of @xmath2 will be generated by @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "these lifts will be such that @xmath60 and @xmath61 have support in @xmath62 $ ] whereas @xmath63 and @xmath49 have support in @xmath64 .",
    "the lifts of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are straightforward , and amount to attaching a @xmath4 $ ] version of the @xmath1 generators into the corresponding box ( from @xmath67 to @xmath68 in the case of those with support on the positive half - line , or from @xmath69 to @xmath67 in the case of those wih support on the negative half - line ) , and repeating it indefinitely in the whole support .",
    "the lifts of @xmath61 and @xmath49 to @xmath24 are trickier , and some choice is involved .",
    "our choices are shown in figures [ autfgens1 ] and [ autfgens2 ] , but by no means should those be considered canonical .    , both as maps of @xmath31 and as pairs of periodic trees .",

    "the relators for @xmath24 can be worked out following the standard procedure for short exact sequences .",
    "these relators can be classified in three types :    1 .",
    "the two relators for the kernel @xmath1 , namely , @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 $ ] ( 2 relators ) .",
    "2 .   the lifts of relators for @xmath43 .",
    "these are furthermore divided into two types : 1 .",
    "commuting relations : he generators @xmath71 commute with @xmath72 ( 9 relators in total ) .",
    "lifts of the relators of the two copies of @xmath2 to @xmath24 : lifting the relators ( f1 ) and ( f2 ) is direct , they lift to the exact same relators but spelled out with @xmath60 and @xmath63 . lifting the relators ( t1 ) to ( t4 )",
    "requires an extra computation and it actually depends on the choice of lifts .",
    "for instance , we will compute two examples , based on the lifts given in figures [ autfgens1 ] and [ autfgens2 ] .",
    "the relator @xmath73 in the first copy of @xmath2 lifts , with our choices , to @xmath74 ; and the relator ( t1 ) , in its @xmath71 version , lifts to @xmath75 there are a total of 12 relators in this class , whose tedious calculation is left to the reader .",
    "the third type of relators appearing in a short exact sequence is given by the action relators : the lifts of the generators of @xmath43 act on the kernel @xmath1 , since this is a normal subgroup .",
    "this gives a total of 12 relators more , each given by the conjugation action of each one of the generators @xmath76 or @xmath49 on @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "again , the computation of these actions is somewhat tedious , and an example is @xmath77    some of these relators will be written explicitly in the following section , when we consider subgroups of @xmath24 generated by some of the generators .",
    "the presentation of @xmath24 would immediately lead to a presentation for the whole group @xmath36 , again using the corresponding short exact sequence .",
    "it is worth noticing that the orientation - reversing automorphism given by @xmath78 would help to reduce the number of generators and relators , since the generators @xmath72 can be easily obtained from @xmath79 by conjugating by @xmath80 .",
    "for brevity , we leave these computations to the reader as well .",
    "we have preferred to spell out the longer presentation for @xmath24 because it will be useful to understand the subgroups studied in the next section .",
    "the structure as a short exact sequence obtained for @xmath24 shows that some interesting subgroups of it can be studied .",
    "let @xmath81 be the quotient map in the short exact sequence . if we consider @xmath1 as a subgroup of @xmath2",
    ", we see that we have a subgroup @xmath82 inside @xmath43 .",
    "clearly , these two copies of @xmath1 are generated by @xmath60 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "since we will use them often , and to clarify which one we are referring to , we will rename them @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in the same way the kernel copy of @xmath1 will be denoted by @xmath85 .",
    "the first subgroup we will study is the group @xmath86 .",
    "we have now a short exact sequence , similar to the previous one : @xmath87 this short exact sequence has a fundamental difference with the one for @xmath24 .",
    "each element of @xmath88 admits a canonical lifting into @xmath89 , since elements in @xmath1 , seen as maps of @xmath4 $ ] , fix 0 and 1 .",
    "the elements @xmath90 and @xmath91 are lifts of the main generators of @xmath1 to the first component , and @xmath92 and @xmath66 to the second component .",
    "since these elements fix the points @xmath93 for any @xmath94 , we see that these lifts define homomorphisms .",
    "any element of @xmath1 can be lifted to the first or second component , by introducing its graph ( in [ 0,1 ] ) in the corresponding one - by - one boxes of the plane .",
    "note that all elements obtained as lifts of elements in @xmath88 have their graphs included in the union of all the boxes of side @xmath38 $ ] , for all integers @xmath8 .",
    "hence , we have proved the following result :    the short exact sequence @xmath95 splits .",
    "this gives the group @xmath89 a structure of semidirect product @xmath96 where the action of @xmath88 onto @xmath85 is given by the conjugation of the elements of @xmath85 by the elements @xmath60 and @xmath63 .",
    "the group @xmath89 is the subgroup of @xmath24 generated by @xmath97 .",
    "its 18 relators can also be classified in three types , as before :    1 .",
    "the @xmath1 relators on @xmath85 , 2 .",
    "the @xmath1 relators on @xmath83 and on @xmath84 , which lift unmodified to @xmath89 due to the splitting , and also the commuting relations : each of the @xmath60 commutes with the @xmath63 , 3 .",
    "the eight relators of the third type , which specify how the generators @xmath60 and @xmath63 act on the @xmath51 .",
    "the first two examples are @xmath98 and the rest are left to the reader .",
    "these eight relators also belong to the presentation for @xmath24 above . as an easy example , @xmath63 commute with @xmath47 because of disjoint supports .    inside this subgroup",
    "@xmath89 we can obtain two versions of @xmath99 by just taking the first component or the second component only , giving two subgroups @xmath100 and @xmath101 , both isomorphic to @xmath99 but with different actions , and whose generators are @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",

    "we intend to study the group @xmath109 extensively , since its properties are quite interesting .",
    "the group @xmath106 is isomorphic to @xmath1 , and the isomorphism is easy to understand . take an element of @xmath1 as a map of @xmath4 $ ] , and construct a map from @xmath31 to @xmath31 by introducing the one - by - one map in each box of the type @xmath38\\times[k , k+1]$ ] , for each @xmath39 .",
    "this map is the corresponding element in @xmath106 .",
    "notice too that these elements act on @xmath85 , seen now as maps of the real line .",
    "hence , @xmath106 acts on @xmath85 by conjugation , and the result is the group @xmath109 , a copy of @xmath99 .    to generate @xmath106 ,",

    "hence , @xmath106 is generated by the two elements @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "for consistency , we will denote this copy of @xmath1 by @xmath112 as well .",
    "so the elements of @xmath112 are characterized for having the same map in each box @xmath38\\times[k , k+1]$ ] , and when seen as a pair of eventually periodic trees , an element of @xmath112 has actually completely periodic trees : each one of the integral leaves ( see figure [ realtree ] ) has the same tree attached",

    "if @xmath122 , and both are finitely generated , we have the distortion function @xmath123 this theorem , stating that a copy of @xmath1 inside @xmath109 is quadratically distorted , represents an interesting change , since many of the standard subgroups of @xmath1 are undistorted ( see burillo @xcite , burillo , cleary and stein @xcite , cleary @xcite , cleary and taback @xcite , and guba and sapir @xcite ) , as well as the embeddings @xmath124 ( burillo , cleary , stein and taback @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath1 does admit subgroups which are at least polynomially distorted , see guba and sapir @xcite . recently ,",
    "some exponentially distorted embeddings of generalizations of thompson s groups have appeared ( see wladis @xcite , burillo and cleary @xcite ) but they always involve more complicated groups whose elements are represented by two different types of carets .",
    "this is an example of a quadratically distorted embedding different from earlier phenomena .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main ] will be spread throughout the rest of the article .",
    "we start by proving a lower bound for the quadratic distortion of @xmath85 inside @xmath109 with examples .",
    "we consider the family of words @xmath125 . clearly , these words have length at most @xmath126 in @xmath109 .",
    "we will prove that each @xmath127 represents an element of @xmath85 with a number of carets of the order of @xmath128 .",
    "this is enough to prove the distortion is at least quadratic .    for simplicity , we will draw pictures of a word of this type with @xmath129 , but the effect will be quite clear .",
    "as shown in figure [ r4a ] , that the trees for @xmath130 have a repeated tree with 4 carets in each integral leaf .",
    "multiplying by @xmath131 has the effect of shifting four of those trees further down the right - hand - side of the tree , opening up a sequence of 4 empty carets on the right arm of the tree , shown in figure [ r4b ] . when bringing back again @xmath132 ,",
    "those formerly empty spots are filled with trees of four carets each ( see figure [ r4c ] ) , hence having at least 16 carets ( actually 27 ) .",
    "this process will give for a general @xmath133 a quadratically distorted word , with more than @xmath128 carets .     to start the construction of @xmath134 .",
    "notice the four - caret tree repeated throughout.,title=\"fig : \" ] +     with @xmath131 to shift trees down the right - hand - side .",
    "observe the empty area created , which will be filled by quadratically many carets.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +     in @xmath1 , obtained by multiplication by @xmath132 , which fills the five empty spaces with four - caret trees.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    to prove that the distortion is no worse than quadratic , and also the linear distortion of the subgroup @xmath135 , we will give a lower bound on the metric for an element of @xmath109 in terms of the different features of its eventually periodic tree diagram , described in the next section .",
    "in this section we will relate the metric of the group @xmath109 with features of its elements , as it happens with @xmath1 . given an element of @xmath1 , its norm with respect with the generating set @xmath136 is equivalent to the number of carets of its reduced tree diagram ( see @xcite and fordham @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath109 is a semidirect product of two copies of @xmath1 , and the elements also admit tree pair diagrams which are related to those of the copies of @xmath1 , then it makes sense to expect similar results for the elements of @xmath1 .",
    "we have already seen that the inclusion is distorted ( at least quadratically ) , so a completely analogous result is not possible , but we can find a bound for the metric which guarantees that the quadratic distortion is the worst possible .",
    "we consider the short exact sequence defining @xmath109 @xmath137 and let @xmath138 be the section of the map for @xmath139 obtained by repeating the element of @xmath112 thought of as lying in @xmath4 $ ] indefinitely in both directions to lie in @xmath31 , satisfying @xmath140 . given an element @xmath141 ,",
    "its periodic tree diagram is periodic with the same periodic map at both ends , and the single repeating trees give an element of @xmath112 , which is exactly @xmath142 .",
    "the number of carets of the trees of @xmath142 is the first feature we will consider , it will be called @xmath143 in definition [ metric ] .",
    "this number of carets relates to the @xmath112 part of @xmath144 . to consider the @xmath85 part of @xmath144",
    ", we need to see which part of @xmath144 is not related to the periodic parts .",
    "so we take @xmath142 , which is the @xmath112 part , lift it back to @xmath109 , and use it to cancel the periodic part .",
    "this leads to the following definition .",
    "clearly @xmath144 and @xmath146 both map into @xmath142 by @xmath139 , so @xmath147 is in the kernel of @xmath139 , which is @xmath85 .",
    "related to this element we will consider two other quantities @xmath148 and @xmath48 which estimate the complexity and help us to understand the metric in @xmath109 .      1",
    ".   the number @xmath143 is , by definition , the number of carets of the reduced diagram of the element @xmath142 in @xmath112 .",
    "the number @xmath149 is the same but for @xmath147 , that is , the number of carets of the reduced diagram of @xmath150 .",
    "3 .   the number @xmath151 is also computed with the reduced diagram of the element @xmath147 .",
    "it is given by the sum of the number of left and right carets ( not counting the root ) in both trees of the reduced tree diagram for @xmath147 .",
    "see figure [ abc ] to clarify these notions .",
    "we would like to see what is the effect on these three quantities for @xmath144 when it is multiplied by each one of the four generators .",
    "studying these effects carefully we will be able to see which is the worst possible scenario for @xmath152 in an element of length @xmath153 , and use it to find a lower bound for the metric .     and its values for @xmath154 , @xmath148 and @xmath48 .",
    "from top to bottom , we see the element with @xmath154 , the process of computing @xmath147 and the values of @xmath148 and @xmath48.,title=\"fig:\",width=472 ] +    1 .",
    "* multiplication by @xmath46 . *",
    "we see that @xmath142 and @xmath155 are equal , corresponding to the periodic part of these elements , which is unaffected by @xmath46 . from here , we see : @xmath156 so the effect of multiplication by @xmath46 is seen only on @xmath147 , and we can consider the multiplication @xmath157 as if it took place inside @xmath85 .",
    "the quantity @xmath154 itself will remain unchanged , whereas @xmath148 and @xmath48 may grow , but by at most two carets .",
    "so we have : @xmath158 2 .",
    "* multiplication by @xmath47 .",
    "* the situation is quite similar to the previous case .",
    "multiplying by @xmath47 only affects the debris , so @xmath154 stays the same , @xmath148 and @xmath48 can grow by at most 3 .",
    "@xmath159 3 .",
    "* multiplication by @xmath115 .",
    "* when we multiply @xmath144 by @xmath115 , we notice that @xmath154 can grow by two carets , in case that there is no periodic part in @xmath144 .",
    "if there is already a periodic part , it grows by at most one .",
    "we see that @xmath48 is unchanged from @xmath144 to @xmath160 .",
    "the integral leaves that will get canceled when multiplying @xmath161 by @xmath144 will get modified by @xmath115 , but they will still be the same for the two elements @xmath162 and @xmath160 , and they will get canceled the same way .",
    "so the left and right carets for @xmath163 will be the same than those for @xmath147 . +",
    "another way of seeing that @xmath48 is unchanged is by appealing to the maps in @xmath31 . if @xmath144 is periodic outside of a box @xmath164\\times[r , s]$ ] , for integers @xmath165 , then @xmath160 is also periodic outside this box .",
    "the element @xmath115 sends the integer interval @xmath166 $ ] to itself .",
    "+ finally , if @xmath48 is unchanged , we see that the worst that can happen to @xmath148 is that it increases by two carets in every integral leaf that survives in the debris .",
    "we note that when premultiplying by @xmath162 , in each integral leaf there may be two more carets than before , and in the debris , there could be 2 carets more surviving in each integral leaf .",
    "hence , @xmath148 grows by at most @xmath167 . summarizing : @xmath168 4 .   *",
    "multiplication by @xmath116 .",
    "* the situation is again similar to the one for @xmath115 .",
    "the number @xmath154 can grow by at most 3 , @xmath48 stays the same , and @xmath148 can grow in the worst case by 3 times @xmath48 .",
    "so we have @xmath169      the inequalities for @xmath170 and @xmath171 where the number of additional carets can grow by a multiple of @xmath151 is the reason of the quadratic distortion . in the example shown in section [ distortion ]",
    "each surviving integral leaf in @xmath127 ( of which there are @xmath133 ) , gets @xmath133 carets , giving @xmath128 carets in the element .",
    "armed with these inequalities , we now consider any element @xmath144 in @xmath109 , and assume it has length @xmath172 .",
    "so it has been constructed by multiplication of @xmath153 generators , and hence in each one of the @xmath153 multiplications , the quantities @xmath154 , @xmath148 and @xmath48 may have suffered the worst increase detailed above .",
    "this gives the following inequalities :    1 .",
    "@xmath143 and @xmath151 may have grown by at most 3 in each step , so @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "2 .   @xmath149 grows , in its worst case , by @xmath175 . since @xmath48 is at most @xmath176 at the end and thus also in each step",
    ", clearly we have that @xmath177 , or , in a better way for our purposes , @xmath178 .",
    "so the conclusion is the following : there exist a constant @xmath179 such that @xmath180 this inequality is all we need to finish the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "let @xmath181 be an element of @xmath112 with @xmath182 carets , and recall that @xmath182 is equivalent to @xmath183 .",
    "when lifted to @xmath109 , the element @xmath184 is all periodic , so it has @xmath185 , and @xmath186 , so @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "hence , @xmath182 is bounded above by @xmath189 ( up to a multiplicative constant ) , and so is @xmath183 .",
    "thus the periodic subgroup @xmath112 is undistorted .    for the embedding of the nonperiodic subgroup @xmath85 , we take @xmath29 a general element of @xmath85 and consider it also as an element of @xmath109 .",
    "when seen in @xmath85 , it has some number of carets @xmath190 , equivalent to @xmath191 . but naturally @xmath192 if @xmath193 , so we have @xmath194 .",
    "so our inequalities above say that there exists a constant @xmath195 such that @xmath196 which proves that the distortion of @xmath85 in @xmath109 is at most quadratic . from the examples explicitly constructed in section [ distortion ] , we see that the distortion is exactly quadratic ."
