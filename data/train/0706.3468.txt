    "diffractive processes in hadron collisions are well described by regge theory in terms of the exchange of a pomeron with vacuum quantum numbers.@xcite a good channel attracting much attention is the use of hard scattering to resolve the quark and gluon content in the pomeron.@xcite observations of diffractive deep inelastic scattering at hera have increased the knowledge about the qcd pomeron , providing us with the diffractive distributions of singlet quarks and gluons ( dpdf s ) in the pomeron.@xcite at high energies , there is strong suppression of the single - pomeron born cross section due to multi - pomeron exchanges . at the tevatron ,",
    "the suppression factor is about 0.050.2 , whereas for the lhc the suppression is of order 0.080.1 ( see , for instance @xcite for reliable estimates ) .    in this contribution",
    "we summarize the results obtained in @xcite , where the diffractive @xmath1 production is computed for the tevatron energy and estimates are provided for the cern lhc experiment .",
    "we summarize the details concerning the dpdf s in the pomeron , extracted recently in desy - hera , and present theoretical estimates for the gap survival probability factor . in the last section",
    ", we present the numerical results for the diffractive ratio in tevatron and extrapolate them to the lhc energy .",
    "for the hard diffractive processes we will consider the ingelman - schlein ( is ) picture , @xcite where the pomeron structure is probed . the generic cross section for a process in which partons of two hadrons , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , interact to produce a massive electroweak boson , @xmath4 , reads as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distribution function of a parton of flavour @xmath7 in the hadron @xmath8 . the quantity",
    "@xmath9 gives the elementary hard cross section of the corresponding subprocess and @xmath10 is the hard scale in the qcd evolution . in the expression for diffractive processes",
    ", one assumes that one of the hadrons , say hadron @xmath2 , emits a pomeron whose partons interact with partons of the hadron @xmath3 .",
    "thus the parton distribution @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) is replaced by the convolution between a distribution of partons in the pomeron , @xmath12 , and the  emission rate \" of pomerons by the hadron , @xmath13 .",
    "the last quantity , @xmath13 , is the pomeron flux factor and its explicit formulation is described in terms of regge theory .",
    "therefore , we can rewrite the parton distribution as @xmath14 where we have defined the quantity @xmath15 .",
    "concerning the @xmath0 diffractive production , one considers the reaction @xmath16 , assuming that a pomeron emitted by a proton in the positive @xmath17 direction interacts with a @xmath18 ( or a @xmath19 ) producing @xmath0 that subsequently decays into @xmath20 . by using the same concept of the convoluted structure function , the diffractive cross section for the inclusive lepton production becomes @xmath21\\ \\frac{\\hat{t}^2 } { \\sqrt{a^2 - 1 } } \\label{dsw}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 \\label{xaw},\\,\\,\\,x_b = \\frac{m_w\\ e^{-\\eta_e}}{\\sqrt{s}}\\ \\left[a \\mp \\sqrt{(a^2 - 1)}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the lepton transverse energy , @xmath25 is the fermi constant and the hard scale @xmath26 .",

    "the corresponding cross section for @xmath31 is obtained by using the lower signs and @xmath32 .",
    "an important element in the calculation is the pomeron flux factor , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ convop ] ) .",
    "we take the experimental analysis of the diffractive structure function , @xcite @xmath33 , where the pomeron trajectory is assumed to be linear , @xmath34 , and the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 and their uncertainties are obtained from fits to h1 fps data .",
    "@xcite in our estimates , we will consider the dpdf s recently obtained by the h1 collaboration at desy - hera .",
    "@xcite the pomeron structure function has been modeled in terms of a light flavour singlet distribution @xmath37 , consisting of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 quarks and anti - quarks with @xmath41 , and a gluon distribution @xmath42 .",
    "here , @xmath17 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parton entering the hard sub - process with respect to the diffractive exchange , such that @xmath43 for the lowest order quark - parton model process , whereas @xmath44 for higher order processes .",
    "the quark singlet and gluon distributions are parameterized at @xmath45 with the general form , @xmath46 $ ] , where the last exponential factor ensures that the diffractive pdf s vanish at @xmath47 .",
    "the charm and beauty quarks are treated as massive , appearing through boson gluon fusion - type processes up to order @xmath48 .",
    "it has been known for a long time that factorization does not necessarily hold for diffractive production processes .",
    "@xcite the suppression of the single - pomeron born cross section due to the multi - pomeron contributions depends , in general , on the particular hard process",
    ". we will consider this suppression through a gap survival probability factor , @xmath49 , using two theoretical estimates for this factor : ( a ) model of @xcite ( labeled kmr ) , which considers a two - channel eikonal model .",
    "the survival probability is computed for single , central and double diffractive processes at several energies .",
    "we will consider the results for single diffractive processes , where @xmath50 for @xmath51 tev ( tevatron ) and @xmath52 for @xmath53 tev ( lhc ) .",
    "( b ) the second theoretical estimate is from @xcite ( labeled glm ) , which considers a single channel eikonal approach , where @xmath54 for @xmath51 tev ( tevatron ) and @xmath55 for @xmath53 tev ( lhc ) .",
    "let us present the predictions for hard diffractive production of w s based on the previous discussion .",
    "they are compared with experimental data from @xcite in table i , where estimates for the lhc are also presented . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "we have used the new h1 parameterizations for the diffractive pdf s .",
    "@xcite as the larger uncertainty comes from the gap survival factor , the error in the predictions correspond to the theoretical band for @xmath49 . in the theoretical expressions of previous section one",
    "computes only the interaction of pomerons ( emmitted by protons ) with antiprotons ( protons in lhc case ) , that means events with rapidity gaps on the side from which antiprotons come from . disregarding the gap factor ,",
    "the diffractive production rate is approximately 7 % ( using the cut @xmath56 ) being very large compared to the tevatron data .",
    "when considering the gap survival probability correction , the values are in better agreement with data .",
    "when considering central @xmath1 boson fraction , @xmath57 ( cuts of cdf and d0 @xcite ) , we obtain a diffractive rate of 0.67 % using the kmr estimate for @xmath49 , whereas it reaches 0.76% for the glm estimate .",
    "the average rate considering the theoretical band for the gap factor is then @xmath58 % . considering the forward @xmath1 fraction , @xmath59 ( d0 cut ) , one obtains @xmath60 % for kmr and @xmath61 % for glm , with an averaged value of @xmath62 % . in this case ,",
    "our estimate is larger than the central experimental value @xmath63 % . for the total @xmath64 we have @xmath65 % for kmr and @xmath66 % for glm and the mean value @xmath67 % , which is in agreement with data and consistent with a large forward contribution . finally , we estimate the diffractive ratio for lhc energy , @xmath53 tev . in this case",
    "we extrapolate the pdf s in proton and diffractive pdf s in pomeron to that kinematical region .",
    "this procedure introduces somewhat additional uncertainties in the theoretical predictions .",
    "we take the conservative cuts @xmath68 , @xmath69 gev for the detected lepton and @xmath70 .",
    "we find @xmath71 % for kmr gap survival probability factor and @xmath72 % for glm , with a mean value of @xmath73 % .",
    "this means that the diffractive contribution reaches one third , or even more , of the inclusive hadroproduction even when multi - pomeron scattering corrections are taken into account .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to obtain a reasonable overall description of hard diffractive hadroproduction of @xmath1 relying on regge factorization including the suppression from gap survival probability factor .",
    "we find that the ratio of diffractive to non - diffractive boson production is in good agreement with the cdf and d0 data when considering these corrections .",
    "the overall diffractive ratio for @xmath51 tev ( tevatron ) is of order 1 % .",
    "in addition , we make predictions which could be compared to future measurements at lhc .",
    "the estimates give large rates of diffractive events , reaching values higher than 30  % of the inclusive cross section ."
