    "observations using several interferometric gravitational wave detectors ( ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo @xcite , tama @xcite ) on the ground are presently in progress . in order to construct detectors with better sensitivity , future ( second generation ) projects have been proposed : advanced ligo ( u.s.a . ) @xcite and lcgt ( japan ) @xcite .",
    "these projects have km - scale fabry - perot cavities .",
    "the optical transversal mode spacing in these long cavities and the intervals of the elastic modes of the mirrors are on the order of 10 khz .",
    "when the optical transversal mode spacing are comparable with the intervals of the elastic modes , parametric instabilities become a problem in the stable operation of the interferometer @xcite .",
    "small thermally driven elastic vibration modulates the light and excites the transverse modes of the cavity .",
    "these excited optical modes apply modulated radiation pressure on the mirrors .",
    "this makes the amplitude of the elastic modes larger . at last ,",
    "the elastic modes and optical modes , except for tem00 , oscillate largely .",
    "the formula of the parametric instability ( without power recycling , resonant sideband extraction , and anti - stokes modes ) is derived in ref .",
    "if a parameter , @xmath2 , of an elastic mode is larger than unity , that mode is unstable .",
    "the formula of @xmath2 is @xmath3 where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the optical power in the cavity , the q - values of the elastic and optical modes , the mass of the mirror , the speed of light , the cavity length , the angular frequency of the elastic mode , the angular frequency differences between the elastic and optical modes , and the half - width angular frequency of the optical mode , respectively .",
    "the value @xmath6 represents the spatial overlap between the optical and elastic modes . if the shapes of the optical and elastic modes are similar , @xmath6 is on the order of unity .",

    "our investigation revealed that there is the large difference in the parametric instabilities between advanced ligo and lcgt . we discuss the reasons in this section .",
    "the difference in the unstable mode numbers originates from the mode frequency density difference .",
    "if both of the optical and elastic mode densities are large , the optical mode frequencies often coincide with the elastic mode frequencies .",
    "the elastic mode density is inversely proportional to the cube of the sound velocity in the material .",
    "the sound velocities of the fused silica ( advanced ligo ) and sapphire ( lcgt ) are about 6 km / sec and 10 km / sec , respectively .",
    "the elastic mode density of lcgt is 5-times smaller . in advanced ligo",
    ", there are 7 optical transverse modes in a free spectrum range @xcite . on the contrary , there are only 3 modes in the lcgt arm cavity .",
    "the optical mode density of lcgt is 2-times smaller .",
    "the larger optical mode density of advanced ligo stems from a larger beam radius adapted for suppressing the mirror thermal noise @xcite . in lcgt , since the mirrors are cooled in order to reduce the thermal noise @xcite , larger beams are not necessary . as a result , the product of the elastic and optical mode densities of lcgt becomes 10-times smaller .",
    "in fact , the unstable mode number calculated by us for lcgt ( 2 @xmath9 4 in fig . [ lcgt1 ] ) is 10-times less than that calculated at the university of western australia for advanced ligo ( 20 @xmath9 60 in fig .",
    "1(c ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      in lcgt ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath2 depends on the mirror curvature more weakly .",
    "this implies that the curvature dependence of the optical mode frequencies is weaker , because @xmath2 is a function of the optical mode frequencies .",
    "we calculated how the curvature variation affects the @xmath10-th optical transverse mode .",
    "the results were 15@xmath10 hz / m in advanced ligo and 0.58@xmath10 hz / m in lcgt .",
    "lcgt shows a 30-times weaker dependence due to the larger optical transversal mode spacing , which stems from the smaller beam radius .",
    "the difference in the parametric instabilities between advanced ligo and lcgt is caused by those of the beam radii ( advanced ligo , 60 mm ; lcgt , 35 mm ) and the mirror materials ( advanced ligo , fused silica ; lcgt , sapphire ) .",
    "these differences mostly originate from that of the thermal noise - reduction methods ( advanced ligo , fused silica mirrors with larger laser beams ; lcgt , cooling sapphire mirrors ) , which are the main strategies of the projects @xcite .",
    "the cryogenic interferometer has an advantage in the parametric instabilities ( less unstable mode number and weaker dependence on the mirror curvature ) in addition to the small thermal noise @xcite and negligible thermal lensing @xcite .",
    "we showed that the unstable modes of lcgt are less than those of advanced ligo . still , the lcgt arm cavity is unstable because there always exist unstable modes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lcgt1 ] .",
    "we must consider how to suppress the instabilities .",
    "the three methods for instability suppression in advanced ligo are being studied at the university of western australia @xcite .",
    "we checked whether these three methods ( thermal tuning method , feedback control , q reduction of elastic modes ) are appropriate for lcgt ( the tranquilizer cavity @xcite is one of the other methods .",
    "however , this is difficult ) .      in the thermal tuning method @xcite",
    ", a part of the mirror is heated for curvature control .",
    "since @xmath2 depends on the curvature , the suppression of @xmath2 should be possible by this manner . however , this method is not useful in lcgt .",
    "first of all , @xmath2 weakly depends on the mirror curvature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lcgt2 ] in the case of lcgt .",
    "second , owing to the small thermal expansion and high thermal conductivity @xcite of cold sapphire , the mirror curvature would not change effectively , even if we apply heat to the mirror .",
    "it is possible to control the light or the mirror so that the parametric instabilities would be actively suppressed @xcite .",
    "if the number of unstable modes is smaller , feedback control is easier .",
    "however , these are more difficult ( active ) methods than q reduction ( passive method ) of the elastic modes .",
    "this is a useful method @xcite for lcgt .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is proportional to the q - value of the elastic mode , @xmath11 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) .",
    "the q - values of sapphire are about @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the maximum @xmath2 of lcgt is several hundreds at most , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lcgt2 ] . if the q - values of the lcgt mirrors become @xmath13 , almost all modes become stable .",
    "since the mechanical loss concentrated far from the beam spot has a small contribution to the thermal noise @xcite , we should be able to apply additional loss on a barrel surface , as in fig .",
    "[ coating ] , without sacrificing the thermal noise @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is possible to introduce a 15-times larger loss in the lcgt mirror than that in advanced ligo mirror , because the lcgt mirrors are cooled ( 20 k ) @xcite .",
    "we concluded that the thermal noise of the barrel surface loss is comparable with that of the reflective - coating loss @xcite , when the lcgt mirror q - values become @xmath13 owing to the additional loss .",
    "since the reflective - coating thermal noise is smaller than the goal sensitivity of lcgt @xcite , this barrel surface loss is not a serious problem .",
    "loss on the barrel surface .",
    "although this loss decreases the elastic q - values of the mirror , @xmath11 , it has only a small contribution to the thermal noise @xcite .",
    "thus , this loss suppresses the parametric instabilities without an increase of the thermal noise @xcite . ]",
    "we are able to introduce loss on the barrel surface by coating ta@xmath0o@xmath1 , which is a popular material for the reflective coating of the mirror .",
    "our recent measurement @xcite proved that the loss angle of the sio@xmath0/ta@xmath0o@xmath1 coating is @xmath14 between 4 k and 300 k. since the loss of this coating is dominated by that of ta@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , the loss angle of ta@xmath0o@xmath1 is @xmath15 .",
    "if the barrel loss dominates the mirror q , it would be expressed as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the young s moduli of ta@xmath0o@xmath1 and the sapphire , the thickness of the ta@xmath0o@xmath1 layer , the mirror radius and the loss angle of ta@xmath0o@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "these values are summarized in table [ coatingspe ] @xcite . in order to make the q - values , @xmath11 , @xmath13 , the ta@xmath0o@xmath1 coating thickness , @xmath18",

    "in our calculations for this article , we took only the elastic modes below 100 khz and the first three transverse optical modes into account .",
    "we were calculating higher elastic and optical modes .",
    "our preliminary result suggests that there are unstable higher modes .",
    "however , the elastic q reduction would work more effectively because the typical @xmath2 still seems to be small .",
    "we must evaluate the q reduction technique more carefully for instability suppression .",
    "the effects of power recycling @xcite , resonant sideband extraction @xcite and the anti - stokes modes @xcite must be evaluated as well .",
    "we evaluated the parametric instabilities of lcgt and compared them with those of advanced ligo @xcite .",
    "the number of unstable elastic modes in lcgt is 10-times smaller .",
    "since the strength of the parametric instabilities in lcgt more weakly depends on the mirror curvature , the requirement of the accuracy in the mirror curvature of lcgt is easier to satisfy .",
    "these differences in the parametric instabilities between lcgt and advanced ligo are made by those of the laser beam sizes and mirror materials , which mostly stem from the thermal - noise suppression strategies in both projects ( lcgt , cooling sapphire mirrors ; advanced ligo , fused silica mirrors with larger laser beams ) @xcite .",
    "the elastic q reduction @xcite by the barrel surface ( 0.2 mm thickness ta@xmath0o@xmath1 ) coating is effective for instability suppression in the lcgt arm cavity .",
    "thus , the cryogenic interferometer is a smart solution for the parametric instabilities in addition to the thermal noise @xcite and thermal lensing @xcite .",
