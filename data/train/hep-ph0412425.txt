    "the lepton deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) has been since long time a powerful tool to probe the structure of hadrons and nuclei at small and intermediate scales . after the discovery of the parton structure of nucleons",
    ", dis remains to be the primary source of experimental information on the distribution of quark and gluon fields in the nucleon and nuclei and a valuable tool to test predictions of qcd .",
    "new data from high - intensity electron ( jefferson laboratory ) and neutrino ( numi at fermilab and jparc in japan ) beams will allow in future to further extend our knowledge of the nucleon and nuclear structure from high - precision experiments .",
    "the role of nuclei in dis studies is dual .",
    "first , it should be noted that the study of nuclei at small space - time scales is interesting by itself and it can provide valuable insights into the origin of nuclear force and properties of hadrons in nuclear medium . on the other hand",
    "the nuclear data often serve as the source of information on hadrons otherwise not directly accessible .",
    "a typical example is the extraction of the neutron structure function which is usually obtained from deuterium and proton data in a wide kinematic region .",
    "this procedure requires , in turn , a detailed knowledge of nuclear effects in order to control the corresponding systematic uncertainties .",
    "another example is the determination of nuclear parton distribution functions which are universal high - momentum transfer characteristics of complex nuclei .",
    "significant nuclear effects were discovered in charged lepton dis experiments  @xcite .",
    "these observations rule out a simple picture of a nucleus as a system of quasi - free nucleons and indicate that the nuclear environment plays an important role even at energies and momenta much larger than those involved in typical nuclear ground state processes .",
    "the study of nuclei is therefore directly related to the interpretation of high - energy physics from hadron colliders to fixed target experiments .",
    "the measurements of nucleus - nucleus and proton - nucleus interactions at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite will help to clarify the nuclear modifications of the parton distributions , as well as to define the initial conditions towards the studies of new states of matter in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the understanding of nuclear effects is particularly relevant for neutrino physics , where the tiny cross - section with matter requires the use of heavy nuclear targets in order to collect a significant number of interactions .",
    "the presence of an axial - vector component in the weak current and the quark flavour selection differentiate neutrinos from charged leptons and imply a more complex description of nuclear effects in neutrino scattering .",
    "the role of nuclear corrections to neutrino structure functions has been recently emphasized  @xcite after the nutev collaboration reported a deviation from the standard model prediction for the value of the weak mixing angle ( @xmath3 ) measured in neutrino dis  @xcite .",
    "one of the original motivations of the present work is indeed related to the extraction of the weak mixing angle from neutrino dis data of the nomad experiment  @xcite .",
    "it must be remarked that nuclear effects are important not only in the determination of electroweak parameters , but also for the understanding of neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "the recent high - intensity numi  @xcite and jparc  @xcite neutrino facilities offer the possibility to perform a detailed study of nuclear effects in neutrino interactions on a relatively short time scale .",
    "the construction of a future neutrino factory  @xcite would then allow to reach the ultimate precision of the neutrino probe .",
    "the main experimental information on nuclear structure functions comes from charged - lepton scattering dis experiments performed at cern  @xcite , slac  @xcite , fnal  @xcite and recently at jlab  @xcite .",
    "the measurements usually refer to the ratio @xmath4 of the structure function @xmath5 of two nuclei ( usually a complex nucleus to deuterium ) .",
    "additional data from the drell - yan reaction of protons off nuclear targets are also available  @xcite . from the studies of data on the ratio @xmath4",
    "one can separate a few regions of characteristic nuclear effects : depletion of nuclear structure functions at small bjorken @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) known as shadowing region ; a small enhancement of nuclear structure functions for @xmath7 ( antishadowing ) ; depletion with a minimum around @xmath8 followed by a rise at large @xmath0 ( known as  emc effect \" after the name of the experiment which discovered it ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that a clear @xmath1 dependence has been reported only in the shadowing region , while for @xmath9 @xmath4 is almost @xmath1 independent .",
    "however , the data available on the @xmath1 dependence of nuclear effects are still scarce .",
    "one of the main drawbacks of all existing data is the strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 resulting from the kinematics of fixed ( stationary ) target experiments . as a result",
    ", significant regions of the @xmath10 plane are still uncovered in dis experiments .",
    "many different theoretical models have been proposed to explain the basic features of data ( for a detailed summary of the current understanding of nuclear corrections we refer to recent reviews and references cited therein  @xcite , see also discussion in sec.[nuke - sect ] of this paper ) .",
    "the modelling is important to derive some insights on the underlying physics of observed phenomena .",
    "however , consistent and quantitative description of nuclear effects in dis in a wide kinematical region of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and for a wide range of nuclei are clearly needed . in this paper",
    "we perform a quantitative study of data aiming to develop a model of nuclear dis applicable in the analysis of existing data and in the interpretation of future experiments . in order to describe nuclear data over a wide kinematical region",
    "we take into account many effects including nuclear shadowing , nuclear pion excess , fermi motion , nuclear binding and off - shell corrections to bound nucleon structure functions .",
    "it should be noted that if some effects , such as fermi motion and nuclear binding , are well constrained by other studies or data , the remaining ones are less known .",
    "the main example is the off - shell correction which describes the modification of structure functions of bound nucleons in nuclear environment .",
    "we study this effect phenomenologically by parameterizing the off - shell correction to the nucleon structure function in terms of a few parameters which are fixed from statistical analysis of nuclear data , together with the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that these parameters are universal , common for all nuclei , since they are related to the nucleon structure . in a certain sense",
    "the off - shell correction can be considered as a new structure function which describes the response of the nucleon parton distributions to the variation of the nucleon invariant mass .",
    "even if this structure function is not accessible for free proton and neutron , it can be probed in nuclear reactions .",
    "it should be also emphasized that different nuclear effects in different kinematical regions of @xmath0 are correlated by dis sum rules .",
    "for example , the light - cone momentum sum rule links bound nucleon and pion contributions to dis .",
    "we use this requirement in order to constrain mesonic contributions to nuclear structure functions .",
    "another example is the baryon number sum rule which links shadowing and off - shell corrections . in our approach",
    "the off - shell effect provides the mechanism of cancellation of a negative nuclear - shadowing contribution to the normalization of nuclear valence quark distributions .    after fixing the parameters of our model ,",
    "we compute predictions for a number of applications .",
    "in particular , we discuss nuclear valence and sea quarks at high @xmath1 and compute nuclear corrections to neutrino structure functions .",
    "these subjects will be treated more extensively in future publications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : kine ] we briefly summarize the dis kinematics for electron ( muon ) and neutrino scattering and introduce notations used in this paper .",
    "section  [ nucleon ] provides information on the nucleon structure functions and parton distributions necessary for our analysis .",
    "section  [ nuke - sect ] is devoted to the theoretical framework to treat different nuclear corrections in our studies . in particular , in sec.[largex - nuke ]",
    "we examine the derivation of nuclear structure functions in the approximation of incoherent scattering off bound nucleons and nuclear pions ( sec.[sec : pion ] ) , the off - shell effects in the structure functions and quark distributions ( sec.[sec : offshell ] ) and coherent nuclear effects leading to nuclear shadowing and antishadowing ( sec.[smallx - nuke ] ) . in sec.[sec : model ] we discuss in detail the nuclear input which is used in our analysis ( sec.[sec : deut ] to [ sec : pion : details ] ) , the model of off - shell effects ( sec.[sec : modbn ] ) and effective scattering amplitude ( sec.[sec : xsec ] ) .",

    ", the final hadronic state is not detected and the differential cross section is fully given by hadronic tensor @xmath15 , which is the sum of hadronic matrix elements of the electromagnetic current @xmath16 over all final hadronic states ( see , , @xcite ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is four - momentum transfer to the target .",
    "we do not consider the polarization effects and assume the averaging over the target and beam polarizations .",
    "then only the symmetric part of the hadronic tensor contributes to the cross section . because of the conservation of electromagnetic current , time reversal invariance and parity conservation in electromagnetic interaction , the symmetric hadronic tensor has only 2 independent lorentz structures ( see , , @xcite ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 are lorentz - invariant structure functions , and , for simplicity , we use the following notations :    [ tilda ] @xmath21    we use the normalization of states @xmath22 for both bosons and fermions . with this normalization the hadronic tensor and the structure functions @xmath20",

    "these states are described by the photon polation vectors . in the reference frame ,",

    "the hadronic tensor for cc or nc interaction is given by eq.([w ] ) with the electromagnetic current replaced by the corresponding weak current .",

    "it should also be remarked that the neutrino and antineutrino nc structure functions are identical , since neutrino and antineutrino in nc scattering couple to the same hadronic nc .",

    "( see , , @xcite ) @xmath54 where we denote @xmath55 .",
    "the first two terms with @xmath56 and @xmath2 in eq.([cc : sf ] ) are similar to those in charged - lepton scattering and appear due to vv and aa interactions in eq.([w ] ) .",

    "the relations between the helicity structure functions and the structure functions @xmath64 in the neutrino scattering are    [ sf : hel : nu ] @xmath65    the definition of @xmath66 by eq.([ftl ] ) also apply in this case .",
    "one observes from eqs.([sf : hel : nu ] ) that the structure function @xmath57 determines the left - right asymmetry in the transverse helicity structure functions .",
    "the structure functions remain important observables to probe qcd structure of proton and neutron and nuclei . in this section",
    "we briefly review the characteristics of nucleon structure functions necessary for our analysis .      in the region of @xmath1 large",
    "compared to the nucleon scale the structure functions can be analyzed in perturbative qcd .",
    "a working tool of this analysis is the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite . using the ope ,",
    "the contributions from different quark - gluon operators to hadronic tensor can be ordered according to their _",
    "twist_. for the dis structure functions this leads to the expansion in inverse powers of @xmath1 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 labels the type of the structure function ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the first term is the leading twist ( lt ) contribution and @xmath70 are the twist-4 contributions ( higher twist , ht ) .",
    "the _ leading twist _",
    "contribution is directly related to the distributions of quarks and gluons inside the nucleon , the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) via the dis factorization theorem as a convolution with coefficient functions ( for more detail see , , ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the coefficient functions depend on the process and the type of the structure function but are independent of the target .",
    "these functions are computable as power series in @xmath71 .",
    "the parton distributions are independent of the process but do depend on the target .",
    "the pdfs have non - perturbative origin and can not be calculated in perturbative qcd .",
    "however , the @xmath1 dependence of the pdfs can be handled using qcd perturbation theory , and is governed by the well - known dglap evolution equations with the kernel given by the splitting functions @xcite .",
    "the one - loop ( nlo ) coefficient and splitting functions have been computed since long time @xcite .",
    "the two - loop ( nnlo ) coefficient functions  @xcite and the corresponding splitting functions  @xcite are now also available . in our analysis of nuclear data we use both the coefficient functions and the pdfs to nnlo approximation calculated in @xmath72 scheme using the factorization and",
    "the renormalization scales set to @xmath1 .",
    "the ht components involve interactions between quarks and gluons and lack simple probabilistic interpretation .",
    "it must be noted that the twist expansion was derived in the massless limit .",
    "if a finite mass for the nucleon target is considered , the new terms arise in eq.([t - expansion ] ) that mix operators of different spin , leading to additional power terms of kinematical origin ",
    "the so - called _ target mass corrections _",
    "if the parameter @xmath73 is small , the tmc series can be absorbed in the leading twist term @xcite .",
    "therefore , eq.([t - expansion ] ) remains valid with the lt terms replaced by    [ tmc ] @xmath74    where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the nachtmann variable @xcite .",
    "however , it must be remarked that the derivation of @xcite was given in the zeroth order in @xmath77 , assuming that the target quarks are on - shell and neglecting the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , eqs.([tmc ] ) suffer the so called threshold problem .",
    "indeed , it follows from eqs.([tmc ] ) that the target mass corrected inelastic structure functions @xmath78 remain finite as @xmath79 even if the lt terms vanish in this limit .",
    "clearly , the region @xmath0 close to 1 is beyond the applicability of eqs.([tmc ] ) .",
    "however , in the applications to nuclear structure functions at large @xmath0 it is important to meet the threshold condition .",
    "one possible way to deal with this problem is to expand eqs.([tmc ] ) in power series in @xmath80 and keep a finite number of terms . in particular , keeping the lt and the @xmath81 term we have    [ tmc : exp ] @xmath82    in this approximation the structure functions have a correct threshold behavior and vanish in the limit of @xmath79 , provided that the lt terms and their derivatives vanish in this limit .",
    "the target mass corrections should also be applied to the ht terms in the higher order terms in the twist expansion ( [ t - expansion ] ) . for this reason we do not consider @xmath83 terms in the tmc formula , which are small in the considered kinematical range .",
    "we also note , that the extrapolation of the target mass corrections to off - shell region @xmath84 is important in the treatment of the nuclear effects and will be discussed in sec.[off - shell - sect ] .      the twist expansion and pdfs as universal , process - independent characteristics of the target are at the basis of extensive qcd phenomenology of high - energy processes . in phenomenological studies ,",
    "the pdfs are extracted from qcd global fits .",
    "a number of such analyses are available @xcite . in our studies of nuclear data described in sec.[sec : data ] to [ sec : deuterium ] we use the results by alekhin @xcite who provides the set of the nucleon pdfs obtained with the coefficient and splitting functions calculated to the nnlo approximation .",
    "region and including additional data with respect to  @xcite .",
    "this extraction of pdfs also takes into account the nuclear corrections to d data described in the present paper ( see sec.[sec : fits ] ) .",
    "results from the new fits will be reported elsewhere . ] furthermore , the ht terms and the pdf uncertainties have also been evaluated in  @xcite .",
    "it should be also remarked that the twist expansion and perturbative qcd apparently breaks down at low @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the conservation of electromagnetic current requires the structure function @xmath2 to vanish as @xmath1 for @xmath85 .",
    "the data seem to indicate the presence of a transition region between perturbative and non - perturbative regimes at @xmath1 about @xmath86 . in our studies of nuclear effects in the structure functions",
    "some data points at small @xmath0 are in the low-@xmath1 region . in order to match low-@xmath87 and high-@xmath87 regions we apply spline interpolations for the structure functions which obeys the current conservation requirements .",
    "in this section we describe a theoretical framework which will be the basis of phenomenological studies of nuclear dis data discussed in sections  [ sec : model ] to [ sec : results ]",
    ".    the mechanisms of nuclear dis appear to be different for small and large bjorken @xmath0 as viewed from the laboratory system .",
    "the physics scale for this separation comes from the comparision of a characteristic dis time , which is also known as ioffe length @xmath88 ( see , , ref.@xcite ) , and an average distance between bound nucleons in nuclei which is about @xmath89fm . at large @xmath90",
    "the characteristic dis time is smaller than average internucleon distance .",
    "this observation justifies the use of the incoherent approximation for the nuclear compton amplitude in this region .",
    "it was realized long ago that the nucleon momentum distribution ( _ fermi motion _ ) is important effect even in the scaling limit and results in the enhancement of nuclear structure functions at large bjorken @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "after discovery of the emc effect @xcite the calculation of nuclear dis in impulse approximation was revisited @xcite and effect of _ nuclear binding _ was emphasised which explains a significant part of the observed dip in the emc ratio at @xmath91 ( for a review of the emc effect and more references see @xcite ) .",
    "effects beyond the impulse approximation are important .",
    "it should be noted that because of binding , the nucleons do not carry all of the light - cone momentum of the nucleus and the momentum sum rule is violated in the impulse approximation . a natural way to correct",
    "this problem is to explicitly consider the pion contribution to the structure functions @xcite which balances missing momentum .",
    "several calculations of the _ pion correction _ to nuclear structure functions have been performed in different approaches and approximations @xcite .",
    "although all calculations predict some enhancement at small @xmath0 , the concrete predictions are model - dependent . in this paper we calculate nuclear pion correction following the approach of ref.@xcite in which the pion contribution was constrained using the equations of motion for interacting pion - nucleon system . by using the light - cone momentum balance equation",
    "we effectively constrain the contribution from all mesonic fields responsible for nuclear binding .",
    "it should be noted that bound nucleons are off - shell particles and their structure functions can be different from those of free nucleons . _",
    "off - shell effects _ in nuclear dis were discussed in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , because of spin 1/2 , the off - shell nucleon is characterized by the increased number of structure functions which depend on the nucleon virtuality as an additional variable @xcite . however , in the vicinity of the mass shell ( which is the relevant case for nuclei ) the off - shell nucleon can still be described by the same number of structure functions as the on - shell nucleon @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the off - shell dependence of structure functions remains an important effect through which the modification of the internal structure of the bound nucleon in nuclear environment can be assessed .",
    "it should be also emphasized that the off - shell effect provides the specific mechanism of balancing a negative contribution to the nuclear baryon number sum rule from nuclear shadowing effect ( for details see sections  [ sec : valnorm ] and [ sec : inter ] ) . in sec.[largex - nuke ] we discuss the derivation of the nuclear structure functions in the presence of off - shell effects with the full consideration of the nucleon spin .",
    "the treatment of the off - shell effect in the parton distributions is discussed in more detail in sections  [ sec : offshell ] and [ sec : modbn ] .    in the small-@xmath0 region",
    "the space - time picture of dis is different .",
    "for @xmath92 the characteristic dis time is large on the nuclear scale , the nuclear dis becomes `` stretched '' in time and in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the process can be viewed as the intermediate boson first fluctuates into a quark pair which can form a complex configuration ( hadronic or quark - gluon ) which then scatters off the target . as an average time of life of such fluctuation is large compared to average distance between bound nucleons , the photon interaction with nuclear targets resembles hadronic properties @xcite . in particular , since hadron scattering amplitudes are almost imaginary at high energy , the double scattering correction to the dis cross - section is negative leading to nuclear _ shadowing _ effect , similar to that in hadron scattering @xcite .",
    "nuclear shadowing in dis was subject to intensive studies @xcite ( for a review of nuclear shadowing and more references see , , @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we treat nuclear shadowing effect in a semi - phenomenological approach by introducing phenomenological amplitude which describes interaction of hadronic component of the intermediate boson with the nucleon and consider the propagation of this state in nuclear environment using multiple scattering theory .",
    "details are discussed in sec.[smallx - nuke ] .",
    "summarizing we write the nuclear structure functions as the sum of incoherent and coherent contributions @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 denote the contributions to the structure function of type @xmath68 from bound protons , neutrons , and nuclear pions , respectively .",
    "the last term in eq.([fa ] ) is a correction due to nuclear coherent interaction .",
    "the exact meaning of all these terms will be explained in the following sections .",
    "the dis hadronic tensor is given by the imaginary part of the virtual photon compton amplitude in the forward direction .",

    "one important observation which follows from this analysis is that eq.([wa ] ) does not factorize into completely separate nuclear and nucleon parts .",
    "the off - shell nucleon is described by 7 independent structure functions in the symmetric @xmath128-even hadronic tensor ( @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) and 4 independent structure functions @xmath131 in the @xmath128-odd antisymmetric hadronic tensor .",
    "these functions depend on @xmath123 as an additional variable and weighted in eq.([wa ] ) with generally different nuclear distributions .",
    "clearly , the fact that we have to deal with unknown functions not present for the on - shell nucleon introduces additional uncertainty in the calculation of nuclear structure functions .",
    "however , in practice it may be quite sufficient to treat nuclei as nonrelativistic systems . in this limit",
    "the nuclear hadronic tensor considerably simplifies , as will be discussed in the next section .",

    "new measurements of @xmath703 from neutrino and antineutrino scattering off different nuclei would help to clarify this issue , provided they can reach a precision comparable to the size of the effects we observe in our analysis ( typically 1% , see fig .",
    "[ fig : normval ] ) .",
    "we conclude this section by remarking that in spite of the major interest of neutrinos as a probe for nuclear effects , virtually no precise experimental information is available so far in dis region .",
    "the only direct measurements of nuclear effects on neutrino dis cross - sections were performed by bebc  @xcite ( @xmath704ne / d ) and cdhsw  @xcite ( @xmath494fe / p ) . however , these results are affected by large statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "it should be emphasized that neutrino dis provides information complementary to that of the charged - lepton scattering and , therefore , the completion of new high - statistics measurements would have a large impact on our understanding of nuclear effects .",
    "the nomad experiment  @xcite collected large neutrino samples on @xmath491c , @xmath492al and @xmath494fe targets allowing a study of nuclear effects from @xmath492al/@xmath491c and @xmath494fe/@xmath491c ratios  @xcite .",
    "the recent nutev cross - section data  @xcite also provide information on nuclear effects in @xmath494fe .",
    "in addition , the chorus experiment  @xcite is extracting neutrino cross - sections from the interactions collected on @xmath499pb .",
    "table  [ tab : nudata ] summarizes the various ( anti)neutrino data samples .",
    "we presented a detailed phenomenological study of unpolarized nuclear structure functions for a wide kinematical region of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "a general approach was developed which , on one side , includes the main nuclear corrections and , on the other side , provides a good description of data on nuclear structure functions .",
    "we take into account the qcd treatment of the nucleon structure functions and address a number of nuclear effects including nuclear shadowing , fermi motion and nuclear binding , nuclear pions and off - shell corrections to bound nucleon structure functions .",
    "starting from a relativistic approach in the description of nuclear dis we then exploited the fact that characteristic energy and momentum of bound nucleon are small compared to the nucleon mass .",
    "this allowed us to compute nuclear corrections in terms of nonrelativistic nuclear spectral function , the quantity which is well constrained by data at low- and intermediate - energy regions .",
    "our analysis suggested that data can not be quantitatively explained in impulse approximation by applying `` standard '' fermi motion and nuclear binding corrections even at large @xmath0 .",
    "this motivated us to address the off - shell effect in bound nucleon structure functions .",
    "this correction was parametrized in terms of a few parameters which were extracted from data , together with their uncertainties .",
    "the effective scattering amplitude which determines the magnitude of nuclear shadowing effect was also addressed phenomenologically .",
    "it should be emphasized that the phenomenological parameters of our model refer to the nucleon structure and for this reason they are common to all nuclei .",
    "we verified this hypothesis by extracting them from different subsets of nuclei .",
    "overall , we obtained an excellent agreement between our calculations and data by using only three independent parameters .",
    "our results show that inclusive nuclear dis data have a good sensitivity to off - shell effects , allowing a precise determination of this correction .",
    "we also note that the study of semi - inclusive nuclear dis in which the kinematics of the active nucleon can be controlled by selecting certain final states would provide additional information on the off - shell effect .",
    "the off - shell effect is related to the modification of the nucleon structure in nuclear environment .",
    "this relation was discussed in terms of a simple model in which the off - shell effect at large @xmath0 was linked to the modification of the bound nucleon core radius .",
    "we found that the off - shell correction derived from our analysis favours the increase in the nucleon core radius in nuclear environment .",
    "we studied in detail the @xmath1 and @xmath11 dependencies of nuclear corrections .",
    "one important application was the calculation of nuclear effects for deuterium , which is of primary interest for the problem of the extraction of the neutron structure functions .",
    "we also applied our model to study nuclear valence and sea quark distributions , as well as the flavour ( isospin ) dependence of nuclear effects .",
    "another important application was the calculation of nuclear structure functions for neutrino scattering . in the present paper we evaluated nuclear corrections for charged - current neutrino structure functions for relatively high @xmath1 , which are relevant for the analysis of existing dis neutrino data .",
    "more detailed studies of neutrino and antineutrino interactions for both charged - current and neutral - current scattering are planned in future publications .",
    "we would like to thank m. arneodo for useful information on nmc data , s. alekhin , a. butkevich and a. kataev for fruitful discussions on different stages of this work .",
    "the work of s.k . was partially supported by the russian foundation for basic research grant 03 - 02 - 17177 and by intas project 03 - 51 - 4007 .",
    "the integration in convolution formulas is constrained by the requirement that the invariant mass of bound nucleon and the virtual photon is high enough for producing physical final states .",
    "in particular , for the region of invariant masses of final states larger than a given mass @xmath705 the required relation is @xmath706 where @xmath707 and @xmath113 the four - momentum of the bound nucleon .",
    "the threshold of inelastic channels corresponds to @xmath708 and by setting @xmath709 we take into account the elastic channel .",
    "here we discuss in detail the constraints on the integration region in the convolution formulas due to eq.([ineq:0 ] ) .",
    "note that eq.([ineq:0 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath710 where @xmath711 and @xmath712 . using this equation",
    "we can write the integral over the bound nucleon four - momentum in convolution formulas as @xmath713 this equation should be applied together with the nuclear spectral function and other functions which enter the convolution formulas . the energy integration in eq.([int:1 ] ) corresponds to the integration over the excitation energies of the residual nucleus .",
    "we first consider the spectral function @xmath714 this is the relevant case for the deuterium , for which @xmath715 and @xmath716 ( see eq.([spfn : d ] ) ) , and also for the model spectral function @xmath717 with @xmath718 the mass of the residual nucleus and @xmath719 the nucleon separation energy averaged over mean - field configurations of the residual nucleus ( see eq.([model : pmf ] ) and the discussion thereafter ) .    the energy integration in eq.([int:1 ] )",
    "can easily be performed and inequality ( [ ineq:1 ] ) then becomes @xmath720 this inequality provides the constraints on the momentum space in eq.([int:1 ] ) . in order to solve it explicitly we chose the coordinate system such that the momentum transfer has only longitudinal component @xmath721 .",
    "then after some algebra ( [ ineq:2 ] ) can be written as ( we retain only the terms linear in @xmath722 ) @xmath723 where the notations are    [ par : star ] @xmath724 , \\\\",

    "inequality ( [ ineq:3 ] ) is most easily solved in terms of _ longitudinal _ and _ transverse coordinates _ , @xmath728 .",
    "in this case , the solution to ( [ ineq:3 ] ) can be written as @xmath729 where @xmath730 is maximum transverse momentum squared of the bound nucleon ( for the given kinematical conditions ) and @xmath731 correspond to those longitudinal momenta at which the left side of ( [ ineq:3 ] ) is 0 , @xmath732 the momentum integral in eq.([int:1 ] ) in terms of these variables is @xmath733 the reqirement @xmath734 gives the constraint on possible @xmath0 and @xmath1 in inelastic scattering off bound nucleon . determines the maximum possible @xmath0 which can be achieved in dis from bound nucleon . in application to the deuteron this gives @xmath735 ( neglecting @xmath80 terms and @xmath736 corrections in eq.([par : star ] ) ) .",
    "this is different from the kinematical maximum @xmath737 , which corresponds to elastic scattering from the deuteron as a whole .",
    "we comment that the limit @xmath735 was derived keeping linear terms in @xmath142 . however , the events with such large @xmath0 are due to high - momentum configurations @xmath738 in the wave function and , therefore , require fully relativistic description . ]    in _ spherical coordinates _ we introduce the azimuthal angle @xmath739 between the @xmath30-axis and the direction of the momentum @xmath740 ( here @xmath416 ) .",
    "the solution to ( [ ineq:3 ] ) splits into two different regions with respect to the sign of @xmath741 and the momentum integral in convolution formula can be written as @xmath742 where @xmath743 are the values of @xmath113 at which the left side of ( [ ineq:3 ] ) is 0 @xmath744 and @xmath745 .",
    "the first case in ( [ int : sph ] ) applies if @xmath746 as can be readily seen from eqs.([par : star ] ) , while the last case concerns the regions @xmath747 and @xmath748 .",
    "we now consider generic spectrum in eq.([int:1 ] ) .",
    "the upper limit of energy integration is determined by the threshold separation energy @xmath749 .",
    "we recall that in our notations the separation energy @xmath750 , where @xmath751 is the ground state energy of the target nucleus and @xmath752 is the energy of the residual nucleus including the recoil energy . therefore , for the given recoil momentum @xmath753 , where @xmath754 is the difference of the ground state energies of the target and the residual nucleus and @xmath718 is the mass of the residual nucleus .",
    "the constraints on the momentum space in eq.([int:1 ] ) directly follow from @xmath755 this inequality , written in terms of @xmath756 and @xmath757 , is equivalent to ( [ ineq:2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the discussion of ( [ ineq:2 ] ) can be taken over ( [ ineq:4 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the solutions to ( [ ineq:4 ] ) in terms of the longitudinal and transverse momentum are given by eqs.([sol : tz ] ) and ( [ pz : bounds ] ) .",
    "the integration in ( [ int:1 ] ) in terms of these variables can be written as @xmath758 where the limits of integration are similar to those in eq.([int : tz ] ) and given by ( [ par : star],[sol : tz],[pz : bounds ] ) .",
    "the integration in spherical coordinates is @xmath759 where the notations are similar to those in eq.([int : sph ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of coherent nuclear effects in the @xmath459-even and @xmath459-odd structure functions @xmath2 and @xmath57 is determined by the terms @xmath316 and @xmath316 ( see eqs .",
