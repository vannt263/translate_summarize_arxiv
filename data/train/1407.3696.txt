    "r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars are supergiants distinguished by a very h - poor atmosphere and a propensity to decline in brightness at unpredictable times as clouds of carbon soot intercept the line of sight to the star .",
    "yet another characteristic of rcb stars is that they are rare ; a catalogue assembled by jeffery et al . ( 1996 ) lists just 36 ` cool hydrogen - deficient stars ' , a class which covers warm and cool rcbs as well as five h - deficient carbon ( hdc ) stars which have not exhibited rcb - like declines in brightness .",
    "comprehensive understanding of the origins and behavior of rcb stars may depend on increasing the number of known rcb stars and providing thorough analyses of multi - wavelength observations of new discoveries .",
    "fortunately , several surveys are indeed increasing the sample of rcb stars , e.g. , tisserand et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2011 , 2013 ) and miller et al .",
    "clayton ( 2012 ) provides a comprehensive list of rcb stars known currently .",
    ", the subject of this paper , was identified as a warm rcb star by clayton et al .",
    "( 2009 ) from asas-3 photometry with confirmation provided by low - resolution optical spectroscopy . in this paper ,",
    "our primary goal is to provide an abundance analysis of v532 oph and to compare it with other rcbs .",
    "this comparison involves the abundance analysis of 14 warm rcbs by asplund et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the analysis by rao & lambert ( 2003 ) of another recent rcb discovery v2552 oph ( kazarovets et al .",
    "2003 ; hesselbach , clayton , & smith 2003 ) .",
    "the comparison rcb stars like v532 oph are all warm rcb with optical spectra dominated by atomic and not molecular lines . with the exception of z umi (",
    "kipper & klochkova 2006 ) , cool rcb stars with spectra dominated by c@xmath3 and cn lines have not been subjected to abundance analyses .",
    "our analysis shows that v532 oph has a composition representative of majority rcb stars but stands out with a lower than average o abundance and heavy element ( y to la ) abundances greater than average .",
    "v532 oph with , also an o - poor rcb , hint at a new correlation between the o abundance and fraction of stellar flux absorbed and reradiated as the infrared excess emission by the circumstellar dust .",
    "observations of v532 oph were obtained on two occasions ( table 1 ) with the robert g. tull cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph of the harlan j. smith 2.7 m reflector at the w.j .",
    "mcdonald observatory ( tull et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the spectral resolving power , @xmath4 , employed was 40000 .",
    "the spectrum covers 3900 to 10000  with gaps beyond about 5600  where the echelle orders were incompletely captured on the tektronix 2048 x 2048 ccd .",
    "two exposures of 30 minutes were combined for each night .",
    "a nearby hot star was observed to remove the telluric line contribution .",
    "the light curve for the period 2009 to 2014 based on aavso observations shows that the star was at maximum light when our observations were obtained .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , < \" , ]      + @xmath5 n = number of lines used in the analyses .",
    "+ @xmath6 from rao & lambert ( 2003 ) .",
    "+ @xmath7 abundance difference between v532oph and r crb .",
    "[ default ]",
    "other aspects of v532 oph s optical spectrum at maximum light show that the star is a typical majority rcb .",
    "in particular , there is evidence for a wind off the photosphere .",
    "this is clearly shown by the extended blue wing to the oi 7771   line ( figure 9 ) and other strong lines .",
    "the implied terminal velocity indicated by each strong line correlates well with the lower excitation potential ( lep ) of the line .",
    "the velocity - lep relation is very similar to that shown for r crb ( rao , lambert & shetrone 2006 ) .",
    "a feature of rcbs is their ability to form carbon soot .",
    "if a soot cloud intercepts the line of sight , it causes the characteristic dimming of the star .",
    "such a cloud and others existing off the line of sight absorb starlight and emit in the infrared to provide an infrared excess .",
    "thanks to clouds off the line of sight , an infrared excess will be present even in the absence of a cloud along the line of sight , i.e. , when the star is at maximum light . warm dust may contribute excess flux even at the k or even the h band .",
    "clayton et al .",
    "( 2009 ) noted that the interstellar reddening - corrected j - h , h - k colours of v532 oph appeared unaffected by dust emission .",
    "cooler dust gives an excess at longer wavelengths .",
    "for v532 oph , mid - infrared measurements from the akari satellite ( ishihara et al .",
    "2010 ) detected excess emission at 18@xmath8 m .",
    "iras also detected the source at 12@xmath8 m but not at 25@xmath8 m ( helou & walker 1988 ) .",
    "our recent investigation of _ spitzer _ spectra explored the characteristics of infrared excesses for a large sample of rcbs ( garca - hernandez et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) . in this investigation , a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for a star was constructed from optical and infrared photometry corrected for interstellar reddening .",
    "a sed for v532 oph was constructed for e(b - v ) = 0.76 with optical photometry from clayton et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and near - infrared photometry from 2mass",
    "( cutri et al . 2003 ) .",
    "mid - infrared photometry is from satellites iras in 1983 , akari in 2006 and wise ( wright et al .",
    "2010 ) in 2010 ( figure 10 ) . the infrared flux in 1983 and 2006 was similar in strength but was appreciably stronger in 2010 .",
    "a blackbody fit to the stellar fluxes and the infrared emission by dust gives a stellar blackbody temperature of 6750 k and dust temperatures of 400 k in 1983 and 2006 and 700 k in 2010 .",
    "the fraction of stellar flux absorbed and reemitted by the dust is r = 0.03 in 1983 and 2006 but r = 0.09 in 2010 .",
    "this value of r is among the lowest values for rcb stars .",
    "it is intriguing that v532 oph has a low o abundance and a low value of r. in a subsequent paper , we explore the possibility that the amount of circumstellar dust as measured by the fraction r is correlated with the o abundance .",
    "our high - resolution spectroscopic analysis of the recently discovered rcb v532 oph ( clayton et al .",
    "2009 ) confirms that it is a warm rcb .",
    "it belongs to the majority rcb class ( lambert & rao 1994 ) with a lower than average o abundance and an average y abundance .",
    "it exhibits a stellar wind and circumstellar gas and dust .",
    "the dust content as sampled in 1983 , 2006 and 2010 is less than average for the rcb sample studied by garca - hernndez et al .",
