    "recent observations of the kondo effect in semiconductor quantum dots @xcite induced enormous theoretical and experimental activity .",
    "compared to magnetic impurities in solids@xcite , quantum dots@xcite have the great advantage of tunable couplings , and as a result , in these systems the full parameter regime of the single - level anderson impurity model can be systematically explored .",
    "in addition , new types of kondo systems have been realized , like aharonov  bohm rings containing quantum dots@xcite and multi ",
    "level dots@xcite . in vertical dots , a qualitatively new type of kondo effect associated with a singlet ",
    "triplet degeneracy has been observed @xcite , which was later also explained theoretically@xcite .    for lateral dots , this _ singlet  triplet _",
    "kondo effect has been found as well@xcite , but with qualitatively new behavior at low energies , where both the linear conductance and @xmath0 were found to be _ non  monotonic_. theoretical understanding of this behavior has been obtained in two limiting cases : hofstetter and schoeller@xcite have analyzed the interplay between singlet and triplet configurations with _",
    "symmetric _ coupling to the leads , while pustilnik and glazman@xcite have considered general asymmetric couplings but took only the triplet configuration on the dot into account .",
    "agreement with the singlet  triplet scenario of [ ] has recently been found in another experiment@xcite , where  instead of the magnetic field as in [ ]  the stark effect due to the gate potential was used to tune the level splitting . another way to control the level spacing and to study the triplet - singlet transition by a symmetric ( triangular ) arrangement has been proposed in [ ] .",
    "our goal in this work is to extend the studies of [ ] over the entire range of parameters in a non - perturbative way , and to include singlet / triplet degeneracy as well as asymmetry of the tunnel couplings in our transport calculation . to this purpose",
    "we shall use the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) in a rather unconventional way : we shall extract the @xmath1 scattering phase shifts directly from the nrg spectrum@xcite and use these to compute the conductance by applying the landauer - b \" uttiker formula .",
    "our calculations are in good agreement with experiments and reproduce the results in special limits as obtained in [ ] and [ ] .",
    "in this paper we focus our attention to the lateral quantum dot system shown in fig .",
    "[ lateral_dot ] .",
    "such a quantum dot is usually formed by gate depletion in a two - dimensional electron structure .",
    "the conductances between the dot and the leads can be controlled by applying a voltage on the gates separating the dot region from the leads . in this system",
    "coulomb blockade develops when the dimensionless conductances @xmath2 between the dot and the left and right leads drop below 1 : in this regime , electrons have to pay typically an energy of the order of the charging energy @xmath3 to get onto the dot , and therefore transport through the structure is suppressed when the temperature drops below @xmath4 . since coulomb blockade develops when the lowest propagating mode in the point contacts ( between dot and leads ) is at pinch  off ,",
    "all higher modes can be neglected .",
    "the leads can thus be modeled by a single conduction electron mode each@xcite .",
    "note that this is specific to lateral dot systems : in vertical dots ( see e.g.  [ ] ) , many conducting modes participate in transport .",
    "the kondo effect may appear at temperatures @xmath5 if the ground state of the isolated dot is degenerate . in this case",
    "quantum fluctuations to the leads are relevant , and may lead to the formation of a kondo state at an energy scale @xmath6 .",
    "this condition is obviously fulfilled if there is an odd number of electrons on the dot , since then the ground state of the dot has a kramers degeneracy .",
    "the kondo effect then emerges if we lower the temperature below the kondo temperature@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mean single  particle level spacing in the dot .",
    "however , kondo effect can also be observed in dots with an even number of electrons . to understand the physics that leads to the kondo effect in this case ,",
    "let us first study an isolated quantum dot . a generic model of an isolated quantum dot",
    "can be written as@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total number of electrons on the dot , and @xmath11 is the total electronic spin on the dot .",
    "the operators @xmath12 create electrons on a single particle level of the dot , labelled by the spin @xmath13 and a discrete quantum number @xmath14 .",
    "( [ h_dot ] ) describes the electron - electron interaction at the mean field level . in general",
    ", more complicated interaction terms should be present in @xmath15@xcite .",
    "these terms are , however , relatively small for dots with a large number of electrons and furthermore , they do not influence our discussion of the singlet triplet transition below , therefore we shall neglect them .    the parameter @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ h_dot ] ) denotes the dimensionless gate voltage , and it sets the average number @xmath17 of electrons on the dot , @xmath18 is the zeeman field , and @xmath4 and @xmath19 stand for the charging energy and the hund s rule coupling , respectively . in the rest of the paper",
    "we shall focus our attention to the case where @xmath16 is close to an even integer , and we shall assume @xmath20 , characteristic of lateral dots with a large number of electrons@xcite . under these conditions , the ground state of eq .",
    "( [ h_dot ] ) is typically a singlet state shown on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : gs ] , and therefore no kondo effect occurs . if , however , the last occupied ( @xmath21 ) and the first empty state ( @xmath22 ) happen to be close enough to each other , so that @xmath23 , then the system will form a triplet state to gain energy from the hund s rule coupling by rearranging the level occupancy ( see fig .  [ fig : gs ] ) . in this case",
    "the ground state is threefold degenerate and a kondo state can be formed .",
    "this transition occurs when the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states approximately vanishes : @xmath24    the kondo effect is driven by virtual charge fluctuations to the leads . since the coupling between the leads and the dot is weak , @xmath25 , we shall describe these fluctuations in terms of the following simple tunneling hamiltonian : @xmath26 the operators @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ h_leads ] ) create electrons with momentum @xmath28 , energy @xmath29 and spin @xmath13 in the left and right leads ( @xmath30 ) , respectively .",
    "( [ h_tunneling ] ) describes the tunneling between the dot states ( labelled by the spin @xmath13 and a discrete quantum number @xmath14 ) and the leads .    in the vicinity of the singlet - triplet transition charge ( and spin )",
    "fluctuations on the dot are dominated by fluctuations to the states @xmath31 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to restrict the summations in eqs .",
    "( [ h_dot ] ) and ( [ h_tunneling ] ) and keep only these two states : @xmath32 this projection will not crucially influence our results , and the two - level model is expected to capture all _ universal _ aspects of the problem until the relevant energy scales of the system that govern the singlet - triplet transition ( _ i.e. _ , the kondo scales , @xmath18 , and @xmath33 ) are all small compared to all other energy scales ( @xmath4 , @xmath8 etc . ) in the problem .",
    "however , when projecting to these two states , one also has to keep in mind that at energy scales larger than @xmath34 fluctuations the the _ excited _ states of the dot destroy those coherent contributions that give rise the kondo effect .",
    "therefore , at the same time the effective band - width in eq .",
    "( [ h_tunneling ] ) has to be reduced to @xmath35@xcite .    in the following sections we shall study the conductance of the dot when one gradually drives the system through the triplet singlet transition .",
    "there are several experimental techniques to achieve this goal and tune @xmath36 and thus @xmath33 .",
    "the easiest method is to apply a magnetic field @xmath37 perpendicular to the plane of the dot .",
    "the primary effect of @xmath38 is to change the orbital wave functions and thus to control the value of @xmath39.@xcite by linearizing @xmath39 in the vicinity of the transition , one can thus attempt to make a direct comparison of the experimental data with the ( calculated ) linear conductance across the system @xmath40 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath37 also induces a zeeman field @xmath41 : while this zeeman splitting @xmath18 remains small compared to the orbital effect because of the smallness of the electron effective mass and the @xmath42-factor in gaas@xcite , yet it is comparable to the experimentally observed kondo scale on the triplet side@xcite , and leads to some complications when trying to make a direct comparison with the experimental data .",
    "the difficulties related to zeeman splitting were avoided in the experiment [ ] by tuning the singlet ",
    "triplet transition via the stark effect due to an inhomogeneous gate potential .",
    "another way to avoid this problem is to use _",
    "triangular dots _ where the degeneracy of the states @xmath43 can be directly controlled by changing the shape of the dot@xcite . to investigate the dependence of @xmath44 on @xmath18 experimentally",
    ", one may in addition apply a strong in - plane field @xmath45 , which only generates a zeeman splitting without influencing @xmath36 essentially .    with the method outlined in section",
    "[ sec : fs ] we can not compute the finite temperature conductance of the dot .",
    "however , the temperature ( @xmath46 ) , source  drain bias ( @xmath47 ) , and zeeman field ( @xmath18 ) dependences of the conductance are expected to be qualitatively ( but not necessarily quantitatively ) similar to each other",
    ". therefore many of our results can be used to understand qualitatively the finite temperature and finite bias behavior of the dot in the absence of the zeeman field @xmath18 by replacing @xmath18 with @xmath47 or @xmath46 .",
    "as discussed above , in the vicinity of the singlet - triplet transition the hamiltonian of the dot can be truncated to that of a two - level system ( eqs .",
    "( [ h_dot ] ) and ( [ tls ] ) ) .",
    "the tunneling , eq .",
    "( [ h_tunneling ] ) , couples the two levels to the two leads , and the four tunneling amplitudes @xmath48 form a @xmath49-matrix @xmath50    consider first the _ special case _",
    "when one of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath51 is zero , while another one is finite@xcite .",
    "obviously , in this case the dot effectively interacts only with a _",
    "single _ species ( a single `` channel '' ) of conduction electrons .",
    "when the dot is in the triplet state , a single electronic channel can screen only half of its spin@xcite .",
    "accordingly , the system should exhibit a quantum phase transition@xcite : the ground state changes its symmetry from a singlet to a doublet as @xmath36 decreases below a certain critical value @xmath52 .",
    "the linear conductance @xmath53 across the system at @xmath1 and @xmath54 is then strongly @xmath36-dependent@xcite : @xmath55 . at @xmath56 ( when the dot is in the triplet state ) the conductance is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath18 . to the contrary , at @xmath57",
    "the conductance as a function of @xmath18 first increases , and then drops with the increase of @xmath18 . at a fixed finite @xmath18 the conductance @xmath58",
    "is expected to be a smooth non - monotonic function of @xmath36 with a broad asymmetric peak near the transition .    in a _",
    "general situation _",
    ", however , @xmath59 , and both eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath51 are finite . in this case , the dot is coupled to _ two _ electronic channels , which is sufficient in order to completely screen the dot s spin@xcite even in its triplet state . as a result ,",
    "the ground state of the system is a _ singlet _ at all values of @xmath36@xcite .",
    "accordingly , when the dot is coupled to the leads , the singlet - triplet transition turns to a crossover . as we discuss below , the conductance @xmath53 at @xmath1 and @xmath54",
    "is then expected to be a smooth non - monotonic function of @xmath36 , slowly ( logarithmically ) decreasing@xcite at large @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) . far away from the crossover ,",
    "the conductance is a non - monotonic function of @xmath18 : it first raises and may reach a value @xmath61 , and then drops again as @xmath18 increases .",
    "this has been shown for both the triplet side of the crossover@xcite ( @xmath62 ) , and for the singlet ( @xmath63 ) side of it@xcite . for a fixed small @xmath18 , however , the conductance @xmath58 can be an even more complicated function of @xmath36 with a local minimum at some @xmath64 and maxima at the triplet side of the transition ( @xmath65 ) and around @xmath66 .    in this paper , we focus on a particular limit when both eigenvalues of @xmath51 are finite , but still very different : @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , we constrain our considerations to a special subset@xcite of the matrices @xmath51 that can be parametrized as @xmath68 this tunneling matrix arises , _ e.g. _ , for a fully symmetric arrangement when the states @xmath31 are symmetric / antisymmetric under reflection . the choice ( [ amplitudes ] ) , although by no means general , nevertheless captures the essential physics of the system . at the same time , as we demonstrate shortly below , the choice ( [ amplitudes ] ) allows one to express the conductance @xmath44 at @xmath1 in terms of simple phase shifts that can be extracted from the finite size nrg spectra@xcite , or in some cases can be related to thermodynamic quantities@xcite .",
    "since the ground state of the system is not degenerate , electrons scatter elastically at @xmath1 .",
    "the scattering amplitudes @xmath69 of an electron with spin @xmath13 from lead @xmath70 to lead @xmath71 form the scattering matrix @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath73 unitary matrix @xmath74 can be diagonalized by a rotation in the @xmath75 space to the new basis of _ channels _ @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 here @xmath79 are the pauli matrices acting in the @xmath75 space .",

    "( [ amplitudes ] ) the tunneling part of the hamiltonian can be trivially diagonalized with the introduction of even and odd states ( corresponding to @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) @xmath86 and the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath87 + h_{\\rm dot}\\;. \\label{h_new}\\ ] ] the hamiltonian ( [ h_new ] ) with @xmath88 given by eqs .",
    "( [ h_dot]),([tls ] ) obviously conserves the total number of fermions in each channel , @xmath89 $ ] , implying that the scattering matrix is diagonal in @xmath14 .    in this case",
    "the conductance simply reads @xcite : @xmath90    following nozires , at small @xmath18 the phase shifts can be expanded to linear order@xcite . as explained in [ ] , a simple analysis shows that in the presence of a zeeman field the conductance at low fields behaves as @xmath91\\left(\\frac{b}{b^*(\\delta ) }    \\right)^2 \\label{small_b}\\ ] ] where the scale @xmath92 is a @xmath36-dependent energy scale and @xmath93.\\ ] ] in other words , far away from the transition the conductance should increase with @xmath18 for @xmath94 while it should typically decrease in the transition region , where @xmath95 .",
    "we have to emphasize that the value @xmath96 , see eq .",
    "( [ small_b ] ) , is specific to the choice ( [ amplitudes ] ) , and not universal .    in the following",
    ", we shall compute the phase shifts using the powerful numerical renormalization group and determine the conductance using eq .",
    "( [ conductance ] ) .",
    "the _ numerical renormalization group _ ( nrg ) was originally developed by wilson to solve the kondo problem@xcite .",
    "in contrast to scaling approaches , it is non  perturbative and does not encounter any logarithmic singularities at low energy . since then it has been extended to the calculation of dynamical quantities @xcite and has been applied to a variety of quantum  impurity problems , including transport calculations for interacting quantum dots @xcite .    in principle , the nrg method enables us to compute the expectation value of any local operator .",
    "thus one plausible method to obtain the phase shifts would be to compute the occupation numbers @xmath97 in the ground state by nrg and then use the friedel sum rule to get the phase shifts as @xcite : @xmath98 unfortunately , this procedure turns out to deliver unphysical results , especially on the triplet side .",
    "the origin of this problem is probably related to the relatively small bandwidth in our calculations and the large logarithmic corrections that appear on the triplet side : as is obvious from the derivation of the friedel sum rule@xcite , there is , in general , a _ correction term _ to eq .  ( [ eq : friedel ] ) which vanishes in the infinite band width limit . in our calculations ,",
    "the kondo temperature is comparable to the bandwidth @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , on the triplet side of the transition the convergence to the ground state is rather slow due to the large ferromagnetic residual exchange coupling , generic to underscreened kondo models , that can even lead to singular non - fermi liquid properties@xcite .",
    "therefore we can not use the friedel sum rule to determine the conductivity of the dot .",
    "nevertheless , the friedel sum rule should definitely work in the limit of very large cut - offs .",
    "it therefore gives us a _ useful tool _ to understand qualitatively the evolution of the phase shifts and the conductance .",
    "fortunately , as discussed below , we can determine the phase shifts _ directly _ from the nrg spectra without making use of the friedel sum rule@xcite .",
    "this method has been first used to compute the conductance of a mesoscopic double dot system@xcite . to do this , we only have to know that the model flows to a universal _ fermi liquid _",
    "fixed point that can be characterized by four phase shifts .    to explain the method ,",
    "let us briefly discuss wilson s nrg procedure .",
    "the key idea of wilson is to map the original problem to a semi  infinite chain .",
    "after this transformation our two  channel hamiltonian maps onto a system of two parallel tight  binding chains coupled to the dot @xmath100 where the hopping matrix elements decay exponentially , @xmath101 , with @xmath102 the nrg discretization parameter . in our calculation",
    "we take @xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath104 represent conduction electron excitations at a length scale @xmath105 .",
    "the nrg assumes a flat dispersionless density of states for the electrons and all energies are measured in units of the bandwidth @xmath99 .",
    "the operator @xmath106 is simply the local field operator defined as @xmath107 , and it is only this operator that tunnel ",
    "couples to the interacting impurity part , @xmath88 .",
    "note also that the discretization procedure somewhat renormalizes the original parameters of the hamiltonian , which are therefore not identical to the ones in eq .",

    "( [ eq : iterative ] ) can be solved by iterative diagonalization , by keeping in each step only the lowest , most relevant levels . in our calculation ,",

    "this fixed point nrg spectrum is _ universal _ and can be characterized by boundary conformal field theories@xcite . in our case",

    "this statement means that the full many body  spectrum of our model is identical to that of the following simple effective hamiltonian ( in fourier space ) : @xmath127 where the phase shifts @xmath128 are related to the couplings @xmath129 and @xmath130 takes integer ( half - integer ) values for even ( odd ) iterations . in more precise terms : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a @xmath102dependent constant to be determined numerically .",

    "since , however , eq .  ( [ conductance ] ) is symmetrical under the exchange of @xmath141 , this caused no problem in the calculation of the conductance .",
    "this method enables us to extract the phase shifts _ directly from the finite size spectrum_. the great advantage of this procedure is that it works directly on the fixed point hamiltonian and therefore eliminates the problem of high energy degrees of freedom that occurred when using the friedel sum rule .",

    "an intermediate magnetic field suppresses the kondo effect with the smaller kondo temperature , @xmath170 , and leads to a large , almost unit conductance .",
    "therefore , in this region , the energy scale @xmath92 should practically correspond to the smallest of these two kondo temperatures , _",
    "i.e. _ the one with smaller hybridization @xmath187 . far away from the triplet side ,",
    "@xmath170 does not depend strongly on the presence of the singlet .",
    "however , in the _ vicinity _ of the singlet - triplet transition , quantum fluctuations to the singlet state are extremely important : they mix all four dot states , renormalize the value of @xmath187 , and generate a strongly correlated state with a kondo scale that is determined by the hybridization to the more strongly coupled channel , @xmath188 . as a consequence , in the vicinity of the transition",
    "these fluctuations strongly renormalize the value of @xmath187 and thus influence @xmath189 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b * ] .    for the parameters of the figure the second kondo scale would be very small in the absence of fluctuations to the singlet state .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 is extremely sensitive to the distance from the triplet - singlet transition , which sets the renormalized value of @xmath187 , and thus that of @xmath190 .",
    "far from the transition the effect of the fluctuations to the singlet state is small , and they do not renormalize @xmath190 substantially .",
    "thus @xmath191 saturates on the triplet side and shows only a weak @xmath36-dependence there , in complete agreement with the experimental results of ref .",
    "however , for larger ratios of @xmath192 , the saturation value @xmath193 becomes so small that it can hardly be observed .",
    "low  energy scale @xmath92 for @xmath194 , @xmath114 and @xmath116 , as determined from the curvature of @xmath44 for small zeeman field @xmath18 .",
    "note the saturation of @xmath195 on the triplet side for the larger @xmath196 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : conductance_vs_splitting_i ] we show the @xmath36dependence of the conductance for three different values of @xmath18 .",
    "the conductance has a similar behavior for the two lower values of @xmath18 . in these cases , far away on the triplet side , we have a situation where @xmath197 .",
    "the smaller kondo scale , @xmath170 , gradually increases as we approach the transition point , and therefore the conductance decreases @xmath170 becomes larger than @xmath18 , thus giving a dip on the triplet side of the transition .",
    "the third case is very different . here",
    "@xmath198 is larger than both kondo scales , and therefore the bump on the triplet side is suppressed .",
    "even the maximum associated with the triplet - singlet transition is shifted to larger values of @xmath36 .",
    "we suspect that in this case the bump has an entirely different origin and is due to the kondo effect associated with the degeneracy of the @xmath183 triplet state and the singlet state@xcite .",
    "linear conductance versus level splitting for different in  plane magnetic fields @xmath18 and a fixed ratio @xmath199 .",
    "the other parameters are the same as in fig .  .",
    "we have studied transport through a lateral quantum dot in the vicinity of a singlet  triplet transition in the ground state .",
    "our calculation is based on the numerical renormalization group , which enables us to calculate the full many  body spectrum of the dot . to determine the conductance we used a new method , first outlined in [ ] , where we extract the conduction electron phase shifts with high accuracy directly from the nrg spectrum and use them in combination with the landauer formula to determine the conductance at zero temperature .",
    "the only requirement for this technique to work is that the system considered must have a fermi liquid ground state with the phase shifts being well - defined quantities .    in our calculations",
    "have modeled the quantum dot by a two  level anderson impurity hamiltonian with asymmetric couplings to the left and right single  mode lead .",
    "our results show that at @xmath1 the sharp quantum phase transition that occurs for symmetric couplings becomes a _",
    "crossover _ at finite asymmetry . as a function of level splitting",
    ", the conductance shows a characteristic maximum ( `` bump '' ) at the crossover point and decreases on both the singlet and the triplet side .    in order to model the effect of finite temperature or bias voltage , we have applied an in  plane magnetic field @xmath18 leading to a zeeman  split triplet .",
    "we find that on both the singlet and the triplet side , the conductance has a _ non  monotonic _ behavior as a function of the zeeman field , thus leading to a characteristic `` dip '' at low @xmath18 . because of the qualitative equivalence between @xmath18 and finite bias voltage",
    ", we expect this structure to appear in the differential conductance @xmath0 as well . the associated low",
    " energy scale ( dip width ) increases linearly on the singlet side , where it corresponds to the renormalized singlet ",
    "triplet splitting . on the triplet side ,",
    "it decreases rapidly with increasing distance from the degeneracy point , which is in agreement with two  stage kondo screening of the triplet .",
    "these findings are consistent with the experimental results of van der wiel _",
    "et al . _",
    "[ ] , where a dip in @xmath0 was indeed found on both sides of the singlet  triplet transition . on the other hand , in the measurements of kogan _ et al . _",
