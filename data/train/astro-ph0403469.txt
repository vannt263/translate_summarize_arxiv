    "star clusters form by gravoturbulent fragmentation in interstellar clouds .",
    "the supersonic turbulence ubiquitously observed in galactic gas clouds generates strong density fluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and most massive regions .",
    "once such cloud regions become gravitationally unstable , collapse sets in and leads to the formation of stars and star clusters . yet the conditions for fragmentation and the physical processes that govern the early evolution of nascent star clusters are poorly understood .",
    "following up on analytical studies ( starting with jeans 1902 ; and later larson 1969 ; shu 1977 ; elmegreen 1993 ; padoan 1995 ; padoan & nordlund 2002 ) , most current investigations concentrate on a numerical approach to star cluster formation .",
    "for example , the effects of interstellar turbulence have been studied extensively in a series of 3d simulations by klessen , burkert , & bate ( 1998 ) , klessen , heitsch , & mac low ( 2000 ) , klessen & burkert ( 2000 , 2001 ) , heitsch , mac low , & klessen ( 2001a , b ) , klessen ( 2001 ) .",

    "we call your attention to the dynamical complexity arising from the interplay between supersonic turbulence and self - gravity , and introduce the concept of gravoturbulent fragmentation .",
    "we argue that in typical star forming clouds turbulence generates the density structure in the first place and then gravity takes over in the densest and most massive regions to build up the star cluster . in section 2",
    "we focus on spatial distribution and timescale of star formation , then in section 3 , we discuss a specific example of a star forming filament similar to those observed in taurus , and in section 4 we speculate about the mass spectra of clumps and stars in the context of the gravoturbulent fragmentation model .",
    "finally , in section 5 we demonstrate that the equation of state ( eos ) of the interstellar gas plays a pivotal role in gravoturbulent fragmentation .",
    "the eos determines whether molecular cloud regions build up clusters of low to intermediate - mass stars , or form isolated high - mass objects .",
    "supersonic turbulence plays a dual role in star formation .",
    "while it usually is strong enough to counterbalance gravity on global scales it will usually provoke collapse locally ( mac  low & klessen 2004 ) .",
    "turbulence establishes a complex network of interacting shocks , where regions of high - density build up at the stagnation points of convergent flows .",
    "these gas clumps can be dense and massive enough to become gravitationally unstable and collapse when the local jeans length becomes smaller than the size of the fluctuation .",
    "however , the fluctuations in turbulent velocity fields are highly transient",
    ". they can disperse again once the converging flow fades away ( vzquez - semadeni , shadmehri , & ballesteros - paredes 2002 ) .",
    "even clumps that are strongly dominated by gravity may get disrupted by the passage of a new shock front ( mac low et al .",
    "1994 ) .    for local collapse to result in the formation of stars , jeans unstable , shock - generated",
    ", density fluctuations therefore must collapse to sufficiently high densities on time scales shorter than the typical time interval between two successive shock passages .",
    "only then do they ` decouple ' from the ambient flow pattern and survive subsequent shock interactions .",
    "the shorter the time between shock passages , the less likely these fluctuations are to survive .",
    "the overall efficiency of star formation depends strongly on the wavelength and strength of the driving source ( klessen et al .",
    "2000 , heitsch et al.2001 ) .",
    "both regulate the amount of gas available for collapse on the sonic scale where turbulence turns from supersonic to subsonic ( vzquez - semadeni , ballesteros - paredes , & klessen 2003 ) .",
    "the velocity field of long - wavelength turbulence is dominated by large - scale shocks which are very efficient in sweeping up molecular cloud material , thus creating massive coherent structures .",
    "these exceed the critical mass for gravitational collapse by far , because the velocity dispersion within the shock compressed region is much smaller than in the ambient turbulent flow .",
    "the situation is similar to localized turbulent decay , and quickly a cluster of protostellar cores builds up .",
    "both decaying and large - scale turbulence lead to a _ clustered _ mode of star formation .",
    "prominent examples are the trapezium cluster in orion with a few thousand young stars , but also the taurus star forming region which is historically considered as a case of isolated stellar birth .",
    "its stars have formed almost simultaneously within several coherent filaments which apparently are created by external compression ( see ballesteros - paredes et al .",
    "this renders it a clustered star forming region in the sense of the above definition .",
    "the efficiency of turbulent fragmentation is reduced if the driving wavelength decreases .",
    "there is less mass at the sonic scale and the network of interacting shocks is very tightly knit .",
    "protostellar cores form independently of each other at random locations throughout the cloud and at random times .",
    "there are no coherent structures with multiple jeans masses .",
    "individual shock generated clumps are of low mass and the time interval between two shock passages through the same point in space is small .",
    "hence , collapsing cores are easily destroyed again .",
    "altogether star formation is inefficient .",
    "this scenario then corresponds to an _ isolated _ mode of star formation .",
    "stars that truly form in isolation are , however , very rarely observed  most young stars are observed in clusters or at most loose aggregates . from a theoretical point of view , there is no fundamental dichotomy between these two modes of star formation , they rather define the extreme ends in the continuous spectrum of the properties of turbulent molecular cloud fragmentation .    altogether , we call this intricate interaction between turbulence on the one side and gravity on the other  which eventually leads to the transformation of some fraction of molecular cloud material into stars as described above  _ gravoturbulent fragmentation_. to give an example , we discuss in detail the gravitational fragmentation in a shock - produced filaments that closely resembles structures observed in the taurus star forming region .",
    "in taurus , large - scale turbulence is thought to be responsible for the formation of a strongly filamentary structure ( e.g.ballesteros-paredes et al .",
    "gravity within the filaments should then be considered as the main mechanism for forming cores and stars . following earlier ideas by larson ( 1985 ) , hartmann ( 2002 )",
    "has shown that the jeans length within a filament , and the timescale for it to fragment are given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the temperature in units of 10@xmath2k , and @xmath3 is the visual extinction through the center of the filament . by using a mean visual extinction for starless cores of @xmath4 , equation 1",
    "gives a characteristic jeans length of @xmath5pc , and collapse should occur in about 0.74@xmath2myr .",
    "indeed , hartmann ( 2002 ) finds @xmath6 young stellar objects per parsec with agrees well with the above numbers from linear theory of gravitational fragmentation of filaments .    in order to test these ideas ,",
    "we resort to numerical simulations .",
    "we analyze a sph calculation ( benz 1990 , monaghan 1992 ) of a star forming region that was specifically geared to the taurus cloud .",
    "details on the numerical implementation , on performance and convergence properties of the method , and tests against analytic models and other numerical schemes in the context of turbulent supersonic astrophysical flows can be found in mac  low et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , klessen & burkert ( 2000 , 2001 ) and klessen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "this simulation has been performed without gravity until a particular , well defined elongated structure is formed .",
    "we then turn - on self - gravity .",
    "this leads to localized collapse and a sparse cluster of protostellar cores builds up .",
    "timescale and spatial distribution are in good agreement with the hartmann ( 2002 ) findings in taurus . for illustration",
    ", we show eight column density frames of the simulation in figure 1 .",
    "the first frame shows the structure just before self - gravity is turned - on , and we note that the filament forms cores in a fraction of myr .",
    "the timestep between frames is 0.1@xmath2myr .",
    "the mean surface density for the filament is 0.033@xmath2g@xmath2@xmath7 , corresponding to a visual extinction of @xmath87.5 . using equations 1 and 2",
    "this value gives a jeans length of @xmath9pc , and a collapsing timescale of @xmath10myr .",
    "note from figure 1 that the first cores appear roughly at @xmath11myr , although the final structure of collapsed objects is clearly defined at @xmath12myr .",
    "the typical separation between protostellar cores ( black dots in figure 1 ) is about the jeans length @xmath13 .",
    "this example demonstrates that indeed turbulence is able to produce a strongly filamentary structure and that at some point gravity takes over to form collapsing objects , the protostars .",
    "however , the situation is quite complex . just like in taurus ,",
    "the filament in figure 1 is not a perfect cylinder , the collapsed objects are not perfectly equally spaced as predicted by idealized theory , and protostars do not form simultaneously but during a range of times ( between @xmath14 and 0.6@xmath2myr ) .",
    "even though the theory of gravitational fragmentation of a cylinder appears roughly , it becomes clear that the properties of the star forming region not only depend on the conditions set initially but are influenced by the large - scale turbulent flow during the entire evolution .",
    "gravoturbulent fragmentation is a continuous process that shapes the accretion history of each protostar in a stochastic manner ( e.g.  klessen 2001a ) .",
    "( 10.0,8.0 ) ( 0.0 , -0.8 ) = 10.0 cm",
    "the dominant parameter determining stellar evolution is the mass .",
    "we discuss now how the final stellar masses may depend on the gravoturbulent fragmentation process , and analyze four numerical models which span the full parameter range from strongly clustered to very isolated star formation ( for full detail see klessen 2001b ) .",
    "figure 2 plots the mass distribution of all gas clumps , of the subset of jeans critical clumps , and of collapsed cores .",
    "we show four different evolutionary phases , initially just when gravity is ` switched on ' , and after turbulent fragmentation has lead to the accumulation of @xmath15% , @xmath16% and @xmath17% of the total mass in protostars . in the completely pre - stellar phase",
    "the clump mass spectrum is very steep ( about salpeter slope or less ) at the high - mass end .",
    "it has a break and gets shallower below @xmath18 with slope @xmath19 .",
    "the spectrum strongly declines beyond the sph resolution limit .",
    "individual clumps are hardly more massive than a few @xmath20 .",
    "gravitational evolution modifies the distribution of clump masses considerably .",
    "as clumps merge and grow bigger , the spectrum becomes flatter and extends towards larger masses .",
    "consequently the number of cores that exceed the jeans limit increases .",
    "this is most evident in the gaussian model of decayed turbulence , the clump mass spectrum exhibits a slope @xmath19 .    the mass spectrum depends on the wavelength of the dominant velocity modes .",
    "small - scale turbulence does not allow for massive , coherent and strongly selfgravitating structures .",
    "together with the short interval between shock passages , this prohibits efficient merging and the build up of a large number of massive clumps . only few clumps become jeans unstable and",
    "collapse to form stars .",
    "this occurs at random locations and times .",
    "the clump mass spectrum remains steep .",
    "increasing the driving wavelength leads to more coherent and rapid core formation , resulting in a larger number of protostars .",
    "long - wavelength turbulence or turbulent decay produces a core mass spectrum that is well approximated by a _",
    "log - normal_. it roughly peaks at the _ average thermal jeans mass _ @xmath21 of the system ( see klessen & burkert 2000 , 2001 ) and is comparable in width with the observed imf ( kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "the log - normal shape of the mass distribution may be explained by invoking the central limit theorem ( e.g.  zinnecker 1984 ) , as protostellar cores form and evolve through a sequence of highly stochastic events ( resulting from supersonic turbulence and/or competitive accretion ) .",
    "so far , we concentrated on isothermal models of galactic molecular clouds .",
    "more generally , however , the balance of heating and cooling in a molecular cloud can be described by a polytropic eos , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a constant , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are thermal pressure , gas density and polytropic index , respectively .",
