    "despite the multifarious observations over 40 years since their discovery , the prompt emission phase of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is still not fully understood in several fundamental aspects ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ) : ( 1 ) what is the composition of the ejecta ( baryonic fireball or poynting flux dominated jet ) ?",
    "( 2 ) what are the energy dissipation and particle acceleration mechanisms ( from shocks or via magnetic reconnections ) ?",
    "( 3 ) what is the radiation mechanism ( synchrotron , synchrotron self - compton , or comptonization of quasi - thermal emission from the photosphere ) ? interpretation of the observed grb energy spectra plays a key role to answer these questions .",
    "a direct identification of the grb prompt emission mechanism would lend further constraints on the energy dissipation mechanism , and eventually on the composition of the grb jets .",
    "grb spectra have traditionally been described by a joint smoothly broken power law function - the  band \" function@xcite .",
    "this function successfully captures the main features of the grb spectra(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but it has been difficult to associate the parameters with the physical processes responsible for the grb emission .",
    "two leading candidate radiation mechanisms for grb prompt emission are synchrotron radiation@xcite and comptonization of quasi - thermal photons from the photosphere of the fireball@xcite , which both successfully reproduce the observed values of @xmath0 ( peak energy in the @xmath1 spectrum ) and @xmath2 ( the high - energy power - law spectral index ) .",
    "the straightforward predictions of the low - energy power - law index @xmath3 of both models , however , deviate from the typical value @xmath4 revealed by the observations(e.g .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the traditional fast - cooling synchrotron model predicts an @xmath3 value of @xmath5@xcite .",
    "this has been regarded as a strong drawback of the traditional fast - cooling synchrotron model to interpret grb prompt emission@xcite .",
    "the photosphere models , on the other hand , predict too hard on spectrum .",
    "a pure blackbody emission in rayleigh - jeans regime predicts @xmath3 @xmath6 + 1 .",
    "relativistic effects ( equal - arrival - time surface effect ) would soften it to @xmath3 @xmath7(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is still too hard compared to the data .",
    "effects that modify the low - energy photon index closer to -1 include adding synchrotron self - absorption or a smooth cutoff in the low - energy electron distribution@xcite , adding a photosphere component in the synchrotron model@xcite , adding a synchrotron component in the photosphere model@xcite , or introducing a certain type of structured jet@xcite . however , some of these modifications either invoke simplified assumptions or introduce spectral features that are inconsistent with the observations .    lllllllllllllll    interval & t1 @xmath6 t2 ( s ) & @xmath3 & @xmath2 & @xmath0 ( kev ) & pgstat / dof & log @xmath8 & @xmath9 & log @xmath10 & log r@xmath11 ( s@xmath12 ) & q & log b@xmath13 ( g ) & b & @xmath14 ( s ) & pgstat / dof + 0&0.00 @xmath6 2.94 & @xmath15 & @xmath16&@xmath17 & 325.71/360&@xmath18&@xmath19&@xmath20&@xmath21&@xmath22&@xmath23&@xmath24&@xmath25&326.44/356 + 1&2.94 @xmath6 5.52 & @xmath26 & @xmath27&@xmath28 & 319.18/360&@xmath29&@xmath30&@xmath31&@xmath32&@xmath33&@xmath34&@xmath24&@xmath35&314.84/356 + 2&5.52 @xmath6 8.10 & @xmath36 & @xmath37&@xmath38 & 305.41/360&@xmath39&@xmath40&@xmath41&@xmath42&@xmath43&@xmath44&@xmath45&@xmath46&308.83/356 + 3&8.10 @xmath6 9.55 & @xmath47 & @xmath48&@xmath49 & 398.80/360&@xmath50&@xmath51&@xmath52&@xmath53&@xmath54&@xmath55&@xmath56&@xmath57&385.33/356 + 4&9.55 @xmath6 10.79 & @xmath58 & @xmath59&@xmath60 & 391.76/360&@xmath61&@xmath62&@xmath63&@xmath64&@xmath65&@xmath66&@xmath67&@xmath68&375.45/356 + 5&10.79 @xmath6 12.42 & @xmath69 & @xmath70&@xmath71 & 390.44/360&@xmath72&@xmath73&@xmath74&@xmath75&@xmath76&@xmath77&@xmath78&@xmath79&373.70/356 + 6&12.42 @xmath6 13.67 & @xmath80 & @xmath81&@xmath82 & 411.70/360&@xmath83&@xmath84&@xmath85&@xmath86&@xmath87&@xmath88&@xmath89&@xmath90&413.08/356 + 7&13.67 @xmath6 14.89 &",

    ", @xcite suggested that the band component , the quasi - thermal component , and the high - energy component are three elemental spectral components in grb spectra .",
    "a recent detailed study of the time - resolved spectra of three grbs@xcite indeed suggests that the interplay among three elemental components can explain a variety of observed grb spectra .",
    "these observations have spurred efforts to apply physical modeling to the grb data and uncover the physical meaning of various spectral components .",
    "the quasi - thermal component is often interpreted as emission from the photosphere of the outflow@xcite . since this component",
    "is predicted to be bright in the standard fireball models , non - detection or a detection of a weak photosphere component point towards a poynting - flux - dominated flow@xcite or a hybrid outflow with significant poynting flux in the jet@xcite . with the quasi - thermal component identified as the photosphere emission ,",
    "the main band component is more likely of a synchrotron origin@xcite far exceeding the temperature of the photosphere@xcite . ] .",
    "@xcite found that the addition of a photospheric blackbody to a synchrotron radiation component reproduces the observed spectrum of eight bright grbs detected by _",
    ", provided that the electrons are in the _ slow cooling _ regime .",
    "this is however contrary to expected , since in the grb emission region , electrons likely cool rapidly due to a strong local magnetic field .",
    "the simplest fast - cooling spectra , even with the superposition of the photosphere component , were found incompatible with the observations .    in these and",
    "previous studies , the magnetic field in the grb emission region is assumed to be constant .",
    "however , in a rapidly expanding jet source such as a grb , flux conservation indicates that its magnetic field can not be preserved as a constant .",
    "this important physical consideration has been taken into account by @xcite . by introducing a decrease in the magnetic field with increasing radius as a ( conical ) jet expands into space and by assuming that the grb emission region is far from the central engine ( typically @xmath289 cm and beyond ) , they create the following picture@xcite : the grb emission is assumed to be generated from fast - cooling synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated in the emission region ( either internal shocks or internal magnetic reconnection sites ) , which is relatively far away from the central engine .",
    "electrons are continuously injected as a power law distribution ( @xmath290 ) with a minimum lorentz factor @xmath291 , and with a certain injection rate as a function of time @xmath292 .",
    "since the emission region is streaming outwards in an expanding jet , the co - moving magnetic field strength decays with radius as @xmath293 .",
    "the accelerated electrons undergo synchrotron cooling in the co - moving frame .",
    "since the cooling time scale is shorter than the dynamical time scale , the electrons are in the fast cooling regime , so that an electron population below @xmath291 is developed as a function of time . in the standard fast cooling model",
    "where @xmath294 is assumed a constant , the electrons below @xmath291 has a spectrum of @xmath295 with @xmath296 , which gives a photon index @xmath297 , inconsistent with the data .",
    "however , in a decaying @xmath294 field , the degree of cooling varies as a function of time , so that the electron spectrum below @xmath291 is curved with an effective @xmath298 .",
    "the photon spectrum therefore hardens .",
    "varying the parameters , the predicted effective @xmath3 can be as hard as -0.8 , with the typical value @xmath4 reproduced for a range of parameters .",
    "this concept for the first time introduces a physical fast - cooling synchrotron model that accounts for the typical observed @xmath3 values can also be reproduced within that model . with a small emission radius , this model may struggle to provide a natural explanation for the seconds - long pulses observed in grbs as well as the hard - to - soft and tracking behaviors of @xmath0 within these pulses . ] .",
    "the investigation of this concept has thus far been limited to numerical calculations that have produced spectral parameters and temporal evolution properties similar to those observed in grbs@xcite , but the model has _ not _ been applied to real data . in this paper",
    ", we aim to test whether such a fast - cooling synchrotron model can really account for the observed grb spectra .",
    "we describe our data reduction method in  2 and fitting tools in  3 .",
    "our fitting results are presented in  4 , followed by a summary and discussion in  5 .",
    "as will be discussed in  [ sec : lucasfitting ] , it is computationally expensive to fit the observed spectra with the numerically calculated synchrotron model .",
    "we select one typical grb detected by _",
    "fermi_/gbm as a test , whose time - resolved spectra can be well fit by the band function . because most grbs have strong spectral evolution during the prompt emission phase(e.g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , this work focuses on the time - resolved data .",
    "we select the second brightest grb in the second gbm catalog , i.e. , grb 130606b ( gbm trigger number 392212536/130606497 ) .",
    "the brightness of the grb 130606b enables us to perform a detailed time - resolved spectral analysis with fine time - resolution , owing to the large number of @xmath299-ray photons .",
    "this grb was about 91 deg from the lat boresight at the time of the trigger and remained well outside the nominal field of view for the standard data analysis during the whole prompt emission ( @xmath6 100 s ) .",
    "a lat detection during the prompt phase was reported using the lat low - energy ( lle ) data @xcite , but the energy response of the lle data at this large offset angle to the boresight is not reliable .",
    "we thus omit lat data from our analysis .",
    "fermi_/gbm data are processed using the standard procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we selected the data from the two brightest nai detectors and the brightest bgo detector .",
    "the light curve of the brightest nai detector ( nai 8) is shown in the bottom panel of figures [ fig : bandfit ] and [ fig : lucas_fit_evo ] .",
    "our analysis only focuses on the main prompt emission episode ( from 0 s to 59 s ; roughly the episode covered by t@xmath300 ) of this burst . based on the signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we divide this time interval into 24 slices ( table 1 and figures [ fig : bandfit ] and [ fig : lucas_fit_evo ] ) . for each slice",
    "we extract the source spectrum , background spectrum and the corresponding response files , which are needed to perform the spectral fitting .",
    "generally speaking , performing a fit does not only mean finding the  best - fit \" parameters , that bring a particular model into optimum consistency with the data , but also means , more importantly , to find the true likelihood map of the entire parameter space , with which one can know how the model can be really constrained in a global confidence manner .",
    "the latter part is more challenging since theoretical models always involve multiple model parameters that may be subject to correlation and multi - modality of the likelihood in their parameter space .",
    "traditional fitting algorithms ( e.g. , levenberg - marquardt ) typically fail to map the multi - dimensional likelihood .",
    "we have developed a fitting engine ( _ mcfit _ ) that employs a bayesian monte - carlo ( mc ) fitting technique to reliably fit parameters that are constrained by the data even when other parameters are unconstrained .",
    "such a technique has been successfully applied to _",
    "swift _ afterglow modeling of grbs with 7 parameters@xcite . using this technique ,",
    "the best - fit parameters and their uncertainties can be realistically determined by the converged mc chains .    to compare a theoretical spectral model to data",
    ", we need to convolve the model with instrumental response , the detector response matrix ( drm ) .",
    "we have written a general - purpose forward - folding code that can handle the instrument response @xmath301 from any mission ( e.g. _ fermi_/gbm ) , read in any model spectrum , @xmath302 , regardless of its form ( e.g. a mathematical function or a tabulated array ) , and calculate the model - predicted count spectrum @xmath303 , which can be directly compared with the observed count spectrum @xmath304 .",
    "we then calculate the likelihood for those @xmath305 and @xmath304 pairs .",
    "such a likelihood function is then input into our fitting engine _ mcfit _ so that the parameter space can be explored . a final software package , _ mcspecfit _ , combines this bayesian mc engine , the general forward - folding codes and the likelihood calculations , and can fit any models to the observed spectra .",

    "the measurement of the goodness - of - fit in each slice is plausible , with pgstat / dof @xmath6 1 , as shown in the 5th column of table 1 . as an example",
    ", we show the parameter constraints resulting from our _ mcspecfit _ in the inner plot of figure [ fig : contour ] .",
    "we also plot the evolution of the three characteristic parameters of the band function model in figure 1 . we notice",
    "that except for 9 slices ( intervals 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 17 and 21 ) the values of @xmath2 are constrained to have fairly large values ( 2.5  8) and large uncertainties , which indicates that a cutoff power law model would also give equally good fits",

    "a strong spectral evolution is shown in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath0 and the peak count rate ( or equivalently , peak flux ) in each slice correlate with each other and show a clear tracking behavior ( see also ford et al 2015 , lu et al 2012 ) .",
    "next , we apply the fast - cooling synchrotron emission model with a decaying magnetic field@xcite to fit the time - resolved spectra .",
    "mathematically , the @xcite model is defined by the following _ nine _ parameters :    * the bulk lorentz factor @xmath8 of the emitting region ; * the magnetic field strength @xmath311 ( in units of _ gauss _ ) at @xmath289 cm ; * the magnetic field decay index @xmath312 ; * the power - law index @xmath9 of the injected electron spectrum ; * the minimum injection lorentz factor @xmath291 of electrons ; * the power - law index @xmath313 of the injection rate as a function of time ; * the normalization of the electron injection rate @xmath314 in units of s@xmath12 ; * the observer - frame time since the first electron injection @xmath315 in units of s of a given emission episode ; * the redshift @xmath316 .    the theoretical flux density ( in unit of mjy ) can be calculated numerically in the form @xmath317 we implement the numerical code of @xcite into the data fitting code , having it serve as a black box to generate numerical model spectra given any set of the input parameters .",
    "( fig1 ) at ( 0,0 ) ; ( fig2 ) at ( 15,10 ) ;        [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     two caveats are worth mentioning .",
    "first , grb 130606b does not have a measured redshift .",
    "we assume @xmath318 in the modeling .",
    "the shape of spectrum does not depend on the redshift . for a different redshift",
    ", the same observed spectrum can be reproduced by essentially adjusting the injection rate parameter @xmath314 .",
    "second , in the fitting , @xmath315 is taken as a free parameter .",
    "strictly speaking , it should be defined as the observer - frame time since the injection of the first group of electrons in a particular emission episode . however , since grb light curves include overlapped pulses , it is hard to track the number of emission episodes . furthermore , the predicted flux is not very sensitive to @xmath315 if the duration is in the time scale of seconds@xcite .",
    "this can be readily seen in fig.[fig : contour ] , which shows that the contour of @xmath315 is relatively broad .",
    "we therefore make no effort to guess the @xmath315 value for each time bin , and leave it as a free parameter .",
    "the results of fitting the data to the synchrotron model are presented in table 1 and figure [ fig : lucas_fit_evo ] .",
    "similar to the band function fitting , we show an example of the parameter constraints for the same time interval 7 in the outer plot of figure [ fig : contour ] . we show that the synchrotron model provides equally good fits to the data as the empirical band function model ( figure [ fig : comp_pgstat ] ) .",
    "the evolution of various model parameters is shown in figure [ fig : lucas_fit_evo ] .",
    "similar to the band function parameters , these model parameters all undergo variations throughout the burst .",
    "as expected , the magnetic field strength in the emission region is found to decay with radius , with @xmath312 varying in the range between 1 and 2",
    ". however , the large error of @xmath312 makes it possible that @xmath312 does not evolve significantly throughout the burst .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation : whereas the flux and @xmath0 vary significantly throughout the burst due to the change of electron injection rate and typical lorentz factors , the geometric configuration and the degree of magnetic dissipation of the jet ( which defines @xmath312 ) do not evolve significantly .      in figure [",
    "fig : comp_pgstat ] we compare the goodness of fits , pgstat , of the band model and the synchrotron model .",
    "one can see that the two models give essentially identical goodness - of - fit .",
    "this shows that the _ physical _ model proposed by @xcite successfully fits the typical grb spectra which are otherwise fitted by the empirical band function ( virtually a mathematical shape ) . in fig.[fig : ph_obs_comp ] , we show a comparison between the photon spectra of the two model fits as well as the residuals of the fits for the time interval 7 as an example . again it clearly shows that both models are adequate to represent the data . in fig.[fig : ph_th_comp ] , we show the model curves of the band function and synchrotron model .",
    "one can see that the two curves are essentially identical within the gbm energy band ( see also @xcite ) , and only show noticeable difference in a much wider energy band .",
    "this explains the capability of the synchrotron model to mimic the band function within the gbm band .",
    "the @xmath0 tracking flux feature ( figure [ fig : bandfit ] ) shown in this burst is commonly seen in a large fraction of grbs(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the simplest synchrotron model with a constant @xmath291 , a hard - to - soft evolution pattern is predicted@xcite .",
    "our analysis suggests that by allowing variation of the parameters especially @xmath291 , the synchrotron model can also reproduce @xmath0-tracking patterns in grbs .",
    "the hardest @xmath3 in our band function fit is @xmath319 ( interval 0 ) .",
    "the best - fit value -0.52 already exceeds the so - called synchrotron `` line - of - death''@xcite .",

    "we find the following two pairs ( figure 7 ) showing `` strong '' ( dancey & reidy 2004 ) correlations with pearson correlation coefficients , @xmath320 : @xmath3-@xmath291 and @xmath3-@xmath313 ; and the following four pairs showing  moderate \" correlations with @xmath321 : @xmath3-@xmath8 , @xmath3-@xmath311 , @xmath0- @xmath291 , @xmath0-@xmath322 .",
    "this indicates that the observed spectral properties can be mostly accounted for by the variations of the jet magnetization and the electron injection parameters .",
    "there are two physical ingredients entering the modeling :    * the first is the cooling of electrons and their synchrotron radiation , which is well understood @xcite .",
    "this physical ingredient controls the _ shape _ of the spectrum .",
    "the general band - like spectral - shape can be reproduced regardless of the details of the model parameters . * the second physical ingredient is related to the energy dissipation physics and particle acceleration physics , which controls the model parameters such as @xmath311 , @xmath312 , @xmath313 , @xmath291 , and determine the band parameters @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 .",
    "this likely invokes magnetic reconnection in a highly variable , highly magnetized environment , and the detailed physics is messy and poorly studied .    as a result",
    ", one can not predict from the first principles the values of those parameters , but can only infer them from the data . in any case , the inferred parameters as listed in table 1 fall into the reasonable ranges from expectation@xcite , and the apparent correlations among parameters are also generally understandable .      for grb 130606b ,",
    "the band function or the synchrotron model can adequately fit the data .",
    "there is no need to introduce a quasi - thermal component , which is presumably the emission from the photosphere of the outflow .",
    "the non - detection of the photosphere component poses a significant constraint on the grb jet composition , which should have a significant fraction of poynting flux in the outflow@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we successfully fit the time - resolved spectra of grb 130606b with a fast - cooling synchrotron radiation model that incorporates magnetic field decay .",
    "the same data are adequately fit by the empirical band function .",
    "this is the first time that we give band function a physical meaning through directly fitting the real grb data with a _ physical _ model incorporating fast - cooling synchrotron radiation .",
    "our fast - cooling synchrotron model@xcite involves a minimal number of physical assumptions .",
    "it is impressive that the time - resolved spectra of grb 130606b , which are characterized by the band function with a wide range of spectral parameters , all can be equally well fit by the synchrotron model .",
    "an @xmath3-index as hard as @xmath319 can be reproduced by the synchrotron model .",
    "limited by the computational resources , it is beyond the scope of this paper to fit the spectra of a large sample of grbs . with a 3.5 ghz 6-core intel xeon e5 cpu on a mac pro workstation , it took about 160 cpu hours to finish synchrotron model fit for one time slice .",
    "altogether it took about 4000 cpu hours to finish all the spectral fitting .",
    "the model fits to this particular grb demonstrate that the synchrotron model can successfully explain typical band function spectra and a systematic study of a much larger sample is highly encouraged for the future studies .",
