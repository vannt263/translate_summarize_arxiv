    "the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect @xcite and its experimental confirmation @xcite are an important consequence of combining quantum mechanics with gauge theories .",
    "the basic ab set - up is the quantum mechanical two - slit experiment for charged particles but with a magnetic - flux - carrying infinite solenoid placed between the two slits .",
    "even though there is no magnetic field outside the solenoid , there is a non - vanishing vector potential , which leads to a shift in the interference pattern formed by the charged particles going through the slits .",
    "however , this shift in the interference pattern depends only on the magnetic flux carried inside the solenoid .",
    "this gives the ab effect a non - local character since the phase of the particle is influenced by the magnetic field , which is zero at the location of the particle .",
    "the closely related aharonov - casher ( ac ) effect @xcite is also a modified version of the quantum mechanical two - slit experiment , but using neutral particles with a non - vanishing magnetic moment traveling through the slits with a line of charge placed between the slits .",
    "one again finds a quantum phase shift due to the presence of the electric field coming from the line of charge .",
    "this phase shift leads to an observable shift in the interference pattern @xcite .",
    "the ac effect can be seen as the dual of the ab effect in the following sense : in the ab set - up one has a magnetic flux carrying solenoid , which can be pictured as a line of magnetic dipoles laid end - to - end , with electrically charged particles moving around the solenoid .",
    "a duality transformation exchanges the magnetic dipoles with the electric charge so that for the ac set - up one has a line of charges with neutral , magnetic dipoles moving around this line of charge . in both cases",
    "the particles pick up an additional quantum phase which manifests itself as a shift in the usual two - slit interference pattern .",
    "both the ab and ac effects are topological since they depend on the non - simply connected nature of each set - up .",
    "the infinite solenoid or the infinite line of charge exclude some region of the space - time so that the space is not simply connected ( for more discussion on this point see @xcite ) .",
    "further the ab effect has been connected to berry phases @xcite which are general  geometric \" phases that arise in certain quantum systems .",
    "while the time - independent ab and ac effects have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally , the same does not hold for the time - dependent cases when the magnetic flux in the solenoid or the electric charge on the wire are time - dependent .",
    "the theoretical predictions as to the outcome of a time - dependent ab experiment have been studied in @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "there is some disagreement , theoretically , as to the outcome of the time - dependent ab effect .",
    "the authors of @xcite predict that the interference pattern should shift with time according to the time dependence of the magnetic flux , whereas the authors of @xcite @xcite find a cancellation between the usual magnetic ab phase shift and the additional phase shift that arises due to the electric field that exists in the time - dependent case .",
    "the one experiment performed to date on the time dependent ab effect @xcite did find no shifting of the interference pattern , but the parameters used in the set - up did not allow one to definitely conclude which prediction  a time dependent shifting of the interference pattern or little / no time dependent shifting of the interference pattern  is correct .",
    "thus additional experiments are called for in the case of the time - dependent ab effect .    in this paper",
    "we write down a covariant version of the ac phase shift , and then use this expression to study the time - dependent ac effect .",
    "the covariant expression which we find for the aharonov - casher phase has some relationship to the geometrical phases obtained in @xcite from lorentz - violating terms from fermion interaction from certain standard model extensions .",
    "in this section we begin by reviewing the derivation of the time - independent aharonov - casher phase @xcite and also the derivation of the bernstein phase @xcite which is also known as the scalar aharonov - bohm phase . , which is also called the electric ab effect , ( ii ) or a phase shift due to the scalar potential @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper the scalar ab effect means version ( ii ) .",
    "] we use these two time - independent phases to give a motivation for our proposed expression for the covariant aharonov - casher phase , and then we give a more rigorous derivation of this covariant expression for the aharonov - casher phase .    in the original ac proposal @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite for an earlier , closely related study ) a neutral , spin-@xmath1 particle was taken to move through an electric field . in reference",
    "@xcite the neutral , spin-@xmath1 particle was taken to be a neutron and the electric field was taken to be that of an infinite line of charge .",
    "the non - relativistic hamiltonian for this system is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the momentum operator and we have set @xmath4 .",
    "also the vector magnetic moment is given as @xmath5 ( where the spin of the particle is @xmath6 with @xmath7 the standard pauli matrices ) and @xmath8 .",
    "the last term , @xmath9 , is negligible if @xmath10 . the main point to note about",
    "is that one can define an effective momentum operator @xmath11 analogously to the minimal coupling definition of the momentum operator for a particle with non - zero electric charge @xmath12 i.e. @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the 3-vector potential .",
    "this operator , @xmath15 , results in the additional ab phase for a charged particle moving along a path @xmath16 of the form @xmath17 in the same way the operator , @xmath18 , from results in an additional ac phase for neutral particle with a magnetic moment moving along a path @xmath16 @xmath19    next we move on to the bernstein phase @xcite or the scalar ab effect .",
    "when a neutral particle with a magnetic momentum passes through a magnetic field the non - relativistic hamiltonian for such a system is @xmath20 it was shown by bernstein @xcite that this hamiltonian also results in a quantum phase shift if the magnetic moment , @xmath21 , moves through a magnetic field , @xmath22 .",
    "the additional phase picked up due to the @xmath0 term in can be written as @xmath23 where in the second integral the time integration has been turned into a space integration via @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the velocity of the particle .",
    "this is done to make the connection with the form of the bernstein phase as given in the original paper @xcite .",
    "however , the main thing to note is that @xmath26 involves a spatial integration while @xmath27 involves a time integration .",
    "this previews the eventual combination of these two phase shifts into a covariant space - time integral .",
    "the magnetic moment in has again been split as @xmath5 .",
    "this phase shift given in was experimentally observed by werner _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the phase shifts due to the electric field ( the aharonov - casher effect ) and magnetic field ( the bernstein effect ) as written in equations and are in non - covariant , 3-vector notation . here",
    "we suggest a 4-vector , covariant expression for the ac effect ( which also therefore includes the bernstein effect ) .",
    "the phase shifts in and can be combined and written covariantly via the expression @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the magnitude of the magnetic moment defined previously . the term @xmath30 is the dual faraday field strength tensor @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the 4d anti - symmetric levi - civita symbol and @xmath33 is the faraday field strength tensor .",
    "the term @xmath34 is the axial spin 4-vector ( see the discussion in @xcite ) which is given as @xmath35 with @xmath6 the standard 3-vector spin and @xmath36 , @xmath37 the usual relativistic gamma and beta factors . in the low velocity limit @xmath38",
    ", one can show that @xmath39 from reduces to the sum of @xmath26 and @xmath40 from and . using @xmath38",
    "one can split into spatial and time integrals as @xmath41 where in the low velocity limit the 4-vector spin has become just the ordinary 3-vector spin . combining this with the dual field strength tensor time - space component  @xmath42 ",
    "one finds that in the low velocity limit the integrand of the second term in becomes @xmath43 where @xmath5 .",
    "next for the dual field strength tensor the space - space components are @xmath44 . combining this with low velocity limit for @xmath34 the integrand of the first term in becomes @xmath45 , which is just the integrand of the aharonov - casher phase in .",
    "the above development is a motivation that the expression given in is the covariant generalization of the aharonov - casher phase and the bernstein phase .",
    "it is possible to obtain this covariant phase more rigorously . as in the original work of aharonov and casher",
    "we start with the dirac equation for a neutral particle non - minimally coupled to via its magnetic moment to the electromagnetic field , @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the mass of the particle , @xmath29 is the magnitude of its magnetic moment , @xmath49 are dirac matrices and @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "next we define the spin projection operators @xmath51 this operator projects out the @xmath52 and @xmath53 components of the spinor @xmath54 along the direction @xmath55 via the expressions @xmath56 thus the spinor @xmath54 can be decomposed as @xmath57 .",
    "the lagrangian in can now be written as @xmath58 in the last line we note that the lagrangian has split into two forms ",
    "@xmath59 or @xmath60  depending on if one has @xmath61 _ or _",
    "this split occurs since for the canonical aharonov - casher set - up the particle beam is polarized so that one has @xmath63 _ or _",
    "this is the reason that in the lagrangians in does not have mixed terms like @xmath65 since the beam is either @xmath63 or @xmath66 .",
    "thus the lagrangian in has been split into two separate lagrangians ",
    "one for @xmath63 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath67 ) and one for @xmath64 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath68 ) .",
    "we now want to work on the terms from of the form @xmath69 .",
    "first , we use the standard properties of dirac matrices and the antisymmetry of @xmath46 and @xmath70 to write @xmath71 .",
    "next we note that @xmath72 since we are interested in the term @xmath73 we can drop @xmath74 from since @xmath46 is antisymmetric and @xmath75 is symmetric . for the remaining terms ,",
    "remembering @xmath76 , we apply @xmath77 to the left and right of @xmath78 above to get @xmath79 where in the second line we have used the fact that @xmath80 is a projection operator _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath81 .",
    "putting all this together we can write the lagrangians in as @xmath82 -m \\right ) \\psi _ \\pm ~,\\ ] ] the lagrangian of the usual minimally coupled dirac particle with charge @xmath12 has the form @xmath83",
    "-m \\right ) \\psi$ ] with @xmath84 being the 4-vector potential . comparing this dirac lagrangian with those in we",
    "find the correspondence @xmath85 ( this correspondence was also noted in @xcite ) .",
    "then using the fact that the minimal coupling @xmath86 gives the covariant aharonov - bohm phase as @xmath87 we conclude that the coupling in , @xmath88 gives the covariant aharonov - casher phase @xmath89 this agrees with the previously given form in .",
    "however here we have derived the covariant aharonov - casher phase starting from the lagrangian in , whereas previously we only gave a motivation for the covariant form of the ac phase via heuristic arguments starting from the 3-vector form of the aharonov - casher phase ( _ i.e. _ - @xmath90 ) and the 3-vector form of the bernstein / scalar aharonov - bohm phase ( _ i.e. _ @xmath91 ) .",
    "we now use the expression in to make two comments about the combined aharonov - casher and bernstein effect .    first ,",
    "from the we can write the integrand as a total differential @xmath92 which gives the identities @xmath93 and @xmath94 . now by the equality of mixed partial derivatives @xmath95 we have @xmath96 using @xmath97 and @xmath98 . plugging this into yields @xmath99 in we were able to replace the partial time derivative by the full time derivative since @xmath100 + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } ( { \\vec e } \\times { \\vec s } ) \\approx \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } ( { \\vec e } \\times { \\vec s } ) ~,\\ ] ] since in the low velocity limit @xmath101 . the result in implies that the force on the neutral magnetic moment , @xmath102 moving in the combined electric and magnetic field is zero in the low velocity limit . moving in a combined electric and magnetic field",
    "is given by @xmath103 so that implies @xmath104 in this low velocity limit .",
    "] the vanishing of the classical force on the particle is one of the conditions of the ab and ac effects .",
    "second , the canonical aharonov - casher effect as given by the phase in is non - dispersive _ i.e. _ the phase shift is independent of the velocity of the particle .",
    "this same non - dispersive feature holds for the aharonov - bohm effect as well .",
    "this is a crucial aspect of the aharonov - bohm effect since if a charged particle interacts directly with a magnetic field , @xmath22 , one will also in general get phase shifts due to the @xmath105 forces on the particle .",
    "however the phase shifts associated with the @xmath105 forces are explicitly velocity dependent and thus dispersive . now for the covariant expression of the ac phase given in or we see that , if we do not make the low velocity limit , that the ac phase shift will depend on the velocity @xmath37 , and will in general be dispersive .",
    "thus the non - dispersive nature of the aharonov - casher effect is a result of taking the low velocity limit . for the non - covariant forms of the aharonov - bohm phase of or the aharonov - casher phase of",
    ", the non - dispersive character of these phases is one of their fundamental features",
    ". from the covariant expression of the phase in equation one finds that there will in general be a velocity dependence due to the form of the @xmath106-spin in .",
    "thus in general the ac effect is dispersive .",
    "in contrast the covariant ab phase given by @xmath87 is still independent of the particle velocity and is non - dispersive even if one relaxes the low velocity limit .    in the next section",
    "we will examine the case where a neutral particle with a magnetic moment moves in the background field of a plane electromagnetic wave .",
    "the plane wave has both electric and magnetic fields , and both fields lead to non - zero phases which have an interesting interplay with one another .",
    "we now want to use the results of the previous section to study a specific example of the time - dependent aharonov - casher - bernstein effect . in the original aharonov - casher paper and in the original bernstein paper",
    "the electric and magnetic fields were static .",
    "for example , the original aharonov - casher setup was for the static electric field of an infinite line charge .",
    "if this line charge were allowed to varying in time then one would generate magnetic fields which would lead to additional phase shifts and therefore the simple 3-vector expression for the aharonov - casher phase , equation , would not be correct ; one would need a covariant expression , such as our proposal in equation , in order to handle the additional phase shift coming from the time dependence of the fields .",
    "the particular time varying electric and magnetic background we consider is a plane electromagnetic wave traveling in the @xmath107 direction and polarized along the @xmath108 direction .",
    "the fields for this are @xmath109 we have written the electric and magnetic fields in terms of arbitrary wave forms , but for concreteness one can take them to be sinusoidal _",
    "e.g _ @xmath110 .",
    "we now use the covariant phase shift expression given in to investigate the phase shift on a neutron moving in the background of the linearly polarized plane wave of .",
    "there are three choices for the direction of @xmath111 ( and therefore the direction of @xmath21 ) : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , or @xmath114 .",
    "choosing @xmath115 gives @xmath116 and @xmath117 so we would get no additional phase shift for this case .",
    "if @xmath118 then @xmath117 while @xmath119 . in this case , if the particle follows a path along the @xmath120 direction with @xmath121 , one gets a time varying ac phase shift from the electric field , but no bernstein phase shift .",
    "the details of this time varying ac phase shift will depend on the details of the velocity of the particle and the frequency of the wave , @xmath122 .",
    "the case @xmath123 is the most interesting and most general since now both the aharonov - casher and bernstein phase shifts are non - zero since @xmath124 and @xmath125 . in this case one",
    "finds an interesting interplay between the two effects .    for the electromagnetic fields given by and the spin in the direction @xmath123 , the combined aharonov - casher - bernstein phase shift according to and for the particle traveling with velocity @xmath25 in the @xmath126-direction is ( we restore a factor of @xmath127 ) @xmath128 dz - \\frac{\\mu}{2c } \\int _ l [ f(\\omega t - k z ) ] { \\hat { \\bf z } } \\cdot ( \\pm dz { \\hat { \\bf z } } ) \\\\ & = &   \\frac{\\mu}{2c } \\int_0 ^l [ f(\\omega t - k z ) ] \\left(\\frac{c}{v } \\mp 1\\right ) dz ~. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the second line we have used @xmath129 and the @xmath130 in the electric field contribution indicates if the particle is going along @xmath131 .",
    "the factor of @xmath1 comes from the spin half of the particle .",
    "note that when the particle moves with the wave ( _ i.e. _ for particles moving in the @xmath132 direction ) the magnetic and electric effects tend to cancel .",
    "this can be seen from the factor of @xmath133 in which goes to zero as the particle velocity approaches @xmath134 _ i.e _ @xmath135 .",
    "( however in this ultra - relativistic limit we would need to take into account the full 4-vector spin , @xmath136 , rather than simply the 3-vector spin , @xmath111 , as we did in ) .",
    "when the particle moves against the direction of the wave ( _ i.e. _ for particles moving in the - @xmath114 direction ) the magnetic and electric effects tend to add .",
    "this can be seen from the factor of @xmath137 in which goes to @xmath138 as the particle velocity approaches @xmath134 _ i.e _ @xmath135 .",
    "this cancellation or adding , depending on the direction of travel of the particle in comparison to that of the wave , was also found in the case of the time - dependent aharonov - bohm for plane waves @xcite .",
    "we now use to calculate the total aharonov - casher - bernstein phase shift for two particles starting at @xmath139 and @xmath140 going out to @xmath141 in time @xmath142 , then turning around and returning to @xmath139 at time @xmath143 .",
