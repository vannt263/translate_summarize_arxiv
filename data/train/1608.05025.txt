    "holographic superconductors_. the motivation is to shed light on the understanding the mechanism governing the high - temperature superconductors in condensed - matter physics . the holographic @xmath0-wave superconductor model known as abelian - higgs model",
    "was first established in @xcite . the well - known duality between anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime and the conformal field theories ( cft )",
    "@xcite implies that there is a correspondence between the gravity in the @xmath3-dimensional spacetime and the gauge field theory livening on its @xmath4-dimensional boundary .",
    "according to the idea of the holographic superconductors given in @xcite , in the gravity side , a maxwell field and a charged scalar field are introduced to describe the @xmath5 symmetry and the scalar operator in the dual field theory , respectively .",
    "this holographic model undergoes a phase transition from black hole with no hair ( normal phase / conductor phase ) to the case with scalar hair at low temperatures ( superconducting phase ) @xcite .    following @xcite ,",
    "an overwhelming number of papers have appeared which try to investigate various properties of the holographic superconductors from different perspective @xcite .",
    "the studies were also generalized to other gravity theories . in the context of gauss - bonnet gravity ,",
    "the phase transition of the holographic superconductors were explored in @xcite .",
    "the motivation is to study the effects of higher order gravity corrections on the critical temperature of the holographic superconductors .",
    "considering the holographic @xmath6-wave and @xmath0-wave superconductors in @xmath7-dimensional boundary field theories , it was shown that when gauss - bonnet coefficients become larger the operators on the boundary field theory will be harder to condense @xcite .",
    "taking the backreaction of the gauge and scalar field on the background geometry into account , numerical as well as analytical study on the holographic superconductors in five dimensional einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity were carried out in @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the temperature of the superconductor decreases with increasing the backreaction , although the effect of the gauss - bonnet coupling is more subtle : the critical temperature first decreases then increases as the coupling tends towards the chern - simons value in a backreaction dependent fashion @xcite .",
    "in addition to the correction on the gravity side of the action , it is also interesting to consider the corrections to the gauge field on the matter side of the action . in particular , it is interesting to investigate the effects of the nonlinear corrections to the gauge field on the condensation and critical temperature of the holographic superconductors .",
    "it was argued that in the schwarzschild ads black hole background , the higher nonlinear electrodynamics corrections make the condensation harder @xcite .",
    "when the gauge field is in the form of born - infeld nonlinear electrodynamics , analytical study , based on the sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem , of holographic superconductors in einstein @xcite and gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite have been carried out . in the background of @xmath3-dimensional schwarzschild ads black hole ,",
    "the properties of power - maxwell holographic superconductors have been explored in the probe limit @xcite and away from the probe limit @xcite . in our recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have analytically as well as a numerically studied the holographic @xmath0-wave superconductors in gauss - bonnet gravity with power - maxwell electrodynamics . however , in that work , we did not investigate the effects of backreaction and limited our study to the case where scalar and gauge fields do not have an effect on the background metric .",
    "our purpose in the present work is to disclose the effects of the backreaction on the phase transition and critical temperature of the power - maxwell holographic superconductors in gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we provide the basic field equations of power - maxwell holographic superconductors in the background of gauss - bonnet - ads black holes by taking into account the backreaction . in section [ m ] , based on the sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem",
    ", we find a relation between the critical temperature and charge density of the backreacting holographic superconductor with maxwell field in gauss - bonnet gravity . in section [ pm ] ,",
    "we extend the study to the case of power - maxwell nonlinear electrodynamics . by applying the shooting method",
    ", we also compare our analytical calculations with numerical results in this section . in section [ crie ]",
    ", we calculate the critical exponent and the condensation values of the power - maxwell holographic superconductor with backreaction .",
    "we finish with conclusion and discussion in section [ con ] .",
    "to study a @xmath7-dimensional holographic superconductor , we begin with a @xmath8-dimensional action of einstein - gauss - bonnet - ads gravity which is coupled to power - maxwell field and a charged scalar field ,",

    "we shall take @xmath27 . with this choice",
    ", the power - maxwell lagrangian will reduce to the maxwell lagrangian in the limit @xmath28 .",
    "it is easy to check that by re - scaling @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , a factor @xmath32 will appear in front of matter part of action ( [ act ] ) .",
    "thus , the probe limit can be deduced when @xmath33 . in order to take the backreaction into account , in this paper ,",
    "we keep @xmath34 finite and for simplicity we set @xmath22 as unity .    taking the backreaction into account",

    "superconductivity phase transition is dual to formation of charged matter field in the bulk , and for occurrence this phase transition in bulk , one needs to prevent the charged matter field to falls into the black hole , thus we expect greater curvature of spacetime in bulk make condensation harder which corresponds to the positive values of @xmath15 .",
    "also for @xmath39 , we shall see that the scalar field can be formed easier , means at higher temperature .",

    "<S> we analytically and numerically investigate the properties of @xmath0-wave holographic superconductors by considering the effects of scalar and gauge fields on the background geometry in five dimensional einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the gauge field to be in the form of the power - maxwell nonlinear electrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem for analytical calculation of the critical temperature and the shooting method for the numerical investigation . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical and analytical results indicate that higher curvature corrections affect condensation of the holographic superconductors with backreaction . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the backreaction can decrease the critical temperature of the holographic superconductors , while the power - maxwell electrodynamics and gauss - bonnet coefficient term may increase the critical temperature of the holographic superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the critical exponent has the mean - field value @xmath1 , regardless of the values of gauss - bonnet coefficient , backreaction and power - maxwell parameters . </S>"
