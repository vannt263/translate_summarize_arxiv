    "the observation of a significant up - down asymmetry in the rate of ( multi - gev ) @xmath11like events produced by the atmospheric @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite , brought to a new level the investigation of the neutrino mass and neutrino mixing problem : for the first time model - independent experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations was obtained .",
    "important evidences for existence of neutrino mixing were found in the experiments with solar neutrinos as well : in all five experiments homestake , kamiokande , sage , gallex and super - kamiokande , which have provided data on the solar neutrino flux so far @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , considerably smaller signals than expected @xcite were observed .",
    "these results are compatible with a depletion of the solar @xmath14 flux on the way to the earth , i.e. , with a disappearance of the solar @xmath14 .",
    "indications for @xmath15 oscillations were reported by the accelerator lsnd experiment @xcite .    the existing evidences for nonzero neutrino masses and neutrino mixing will be thoroughly tested in the next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the super - kamiokande results on the oscillations of the atmospheric neutrinos will be checked in the accelerator long baseline experiments k2k @xcite , minos @xcite and in the cern - gran - sasso ( cngs ) experiment @xcite ; k2k is taking data while minos and cngs experiments are under preparation .",
    "the solar neutrino experiments sno @xcite , which began operation approximately an year and a half ago , and borexino @xcite , and the reactor antineutrino experiment kamland @xcite , will provide new crucial information on the oscillations of solar neutrinos . both borexino and kamland",
    "detectors are under construction and are expected to be operative in 2002 .",
    "the lsnd results on @xmath15 oscillations will be tested in the accelerator experiment miniboone @xcite which is under preparation .",
    "the high intensity neutrino beams from a neutrino factory , with known and well - controlled spectra and fluxes , will allow to study the neutrino oscillation phenomena in considerable detail @xcite .",
    "these studies can provide , in particular , a very precise information on the values of neutrino mass squared differences and of the elements of the neutrino ( lepton ) mixing matrix .",
    "the possibility to built a neutrino factory is extensively investigated at present @xcite .",
    "there is no doubt that the indicated experimental studies will allow to make a big step forward in the understanding of the patterns of neutrino mass squared differences and of the neutrino mixing .",
    "however , no information about the absolute values of the neutrino masses and about the physical nature of the neutrinos with definite mass can be obtained in these experiments .",
    "the problem of the nature of massive neutrinos ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) - are they dirac particles possessing distinctive antiparticles , or majorana fermions , i.e. , truly neutral particles identical with their antiparticles , is one of the fundamental problems in the studies of neutrino mixing . in the minimal version of the standard theory the individual lepton charges @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "are conserved and neutrinos are massless .",
    "massive dirac neutrinos and neutrino mixing arise in gauge theories in which the lepton charges @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are not conserved , but a specific combination of the latter , which could be the total lepton charge @xmath19 , or , e.g. , the charge @xcite @xmath20 , is conserved .",
    "thus , the existence of massive dirac neutrinos is associated in gauge theories with massive neutrinos with the presence of a conserved lepton charge .",
    "massive majorana neutrinos arise if no lepton charge is conserved by the electroweak interactions .",
    "thus , the question of the nature of massive neutrinos is directly related to the question of the fundamental symmetries of the elementary particle interactions .",
    "the relative smallness of the neutrino masses , following from the data , can be naturally explained by the violation of the total lepton charge conservation at a scale which is much larger than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xcite . in this case",
    "the neutrinos with definite mass are majorana particles .",
    "thus , establishing the majorana nature of the massive neutrinos could imply the existence of a new fundamental scale in physics .",
    "experiments studying the oscillations of neutrinos can not answer the question regarding the nature of the massive neutrinos @xcite  , @xmath21 are effectively possible @xcite . however , the amplitudes of these transitions are proportional to the ratio @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the neutrino mass and energy . for the values of the neutrino masses suggested by the existing @xmath4h @xmath5decay data and the data on the oscillations of the solar and atmospheric neutrinos ( see section 2 ) , @xmath25 few ev , the transitions @xmath26 are unobservable at present . ] .",
    "neutrino oscillations , in particular , are not sensitive to the majorana cp - violating phases @xcite which enter into the expression for the lepton mixing matrix in the case of massive majorana neutrinos and which are absent if the massive neutrinos are dirac particles .",
    "thus , the neutrino oscillation experiments can not provide also information on cp - violation caused by the majorana cp - violating phases , and in the case of cp - invariance - on the relative cp - parities of the massive majorana neutrinos .",
    "the majorana nature of the massive neutrinos can manifest itself in the existence of processes in which the total lepton charge @xmath27 is not conserved and changes by two units , @xmath28 .",
    "the process most sensitive to the existence of massive majorana neutrinos ( coupled to the electron ) is the neutrinoless double @xmath8 ( @xmath29 ) decay of certain even - even nuclei ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) :    @xmath30    if the @xmath29 decay is generated _ only by the left - handed ( lh ) charged current weak interaction through the exchange of virtual massive majorana neutrinos _ , the probability amplitude of this process is proportional in the case of majorana neutrinos having masses not exceeding few mev to the so - called `` effective majorana mass parameter '' @xmath31    where @xmath23 is the mass of the majorana neutrino @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the element of neutrino ( lepton ) mixing matrix .",
    "a large number of experiments are searching for @xmath29decay of different nuclei at present ( for a rather complete list see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "no indications that this process takes place were found so far .",
    "a rather stringent constraint on the value of the effective majorana mass parameter was obtained in the @xmath34ge heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite : @xmath35 taking into account a factor of 3 uncertainty associated with the calculation of the relevant nuclear matrix element ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) we get @xmath36 the igex collaboration has obtained @xcite : @xmath37    considerably higher sensitivity to the value of @xmath38 is planned to be reached in several @xmath29decay experiments of a new generation .",
    "the nemo3 experiment @xcite , scheduled to start in 2001 , will search for @xmath29decay of @xmath39mo and @xmath40se . in its first stage , after 5 years of data taking , this experiment will reach a sensitivity to values of @xmath41ev .",
    "a similar sensitivity is planned to be reached with the cryogenic detector cuore @xcite which will search for the @xmath29decay of @xmath42te .",
    "an order of magnitude better sensitivity , i.e. , to @xmath43ev , is planned to be achieved in the genius experiment @xcite utilizing one ton of enriched @xmath34ge .",
    "finally , there is a very interesting proposal @xcite to study the @xmath29decay of @xmath44xe in a background - free experiment with detection of the two electrons and the @xmath45ba atom in the final state .",
    "the estimated sensitivity of this experiment is @xmath46ev .",
    "having in mind the future progress in the experimental searches for @xmath29decay , we derive in the present article the constraints on the effective majorana mass that can be obtained from the analyzes of the latest neutrino oscillation data . more specifically , assuming three - neutrino mixing and massive majorana neutrinos",

    "the neutrino mass spectrum can be of three varieties - with inverted hierarchy , with partial hierarchy and with partial inverted hierarchy , and they are also considered in this paper .",
