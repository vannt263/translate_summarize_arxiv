    "[ fig : eigenfreqs](b ) .",
    "the appearance of @xmath41 in the line width of the atomic feature is a direct signature of the enhanced spontaneous emission rate of the atom , as first predicted by purcell @xcite .",

    "some authors call this strong coupling , but the normal modes are not resolved until the splitting exceeds the width .",
    "this consideration gives rise to a second , more stringent definition of strong coupling , namely , ( iii ) : @xmath55 .",
    "in this regime , multiple rabi oscillations occur on average before the excitation decays .",
    "this definition of strong coupling is reminiscent of rayleigh s criterion defining the resolution limit of an imaging system under incoherent illumination , and is the definition which we adopt here .",
    "we now show that , when a coherent field probes the coupled system , quantum coherence between the atom and cavity can lead to quantum interference and narrow spectral features even in regime ( i ) , where our experiment lies .",

    "the photon number @xmath76 is scaled by @xmath77 in order to obtain a curve that is independent of the probe strength @xmath78 .",
    "the atom - cavity coupling is most pronounced when the atom and the cavity resonate simultaneously with the driving field , so we have set @xmath19 here . the wide double peak ( red )",
    "is calculated for @xmath79ghz , which lies in the region of strong coupling , indicated by ( iii ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : eigenfreqs](b ) .",
    "this curve shows the two spectroscopically - resolved , coupled atom - cavity states .",
    "the curve with a narrow central dip ( blue ) has the coupling reduced to @xmath80mhz ( @xmath81 ) , which places it at the left of zone ( i ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenfreqs](b ) .",
    "the two eigenvalues are not spectroscopically resolved in the sense of region ( iii ) , but they are still apparent as a broad peak with a narrow hole , made visible by quantum coherence .    the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : analogy](c ) can also be understood in the language of eit , as was previously noted @xcite for the complementary case where @xmath82 .",
    "interest in the transition from eit to autler - townes splitting has recently grown @xcite , partly owing to the wide variety of physical systems which exhibit formally similar dynamics @xcite . in our cavity qed system",
    ", this transition is manifest as the passage from dit to strong coupling .",
    "the analogy between dit and conventional eit is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : analogy](e ) . depending on the detuning between the cavity and atomic resonances , the three lowest dressed states of the cavity qed system form either ladder- or @xmath83-type configurations . in this analogy",
    "the cavity plays the role of the absorber , with the atomic dipole ( proportional to @xmath84 ) acting as the coupling field which induces the transparency . the cavity field ( proportional to @xmath85 )",
    "drives the @xmath86 transition , whose ` natural ' line width is set by the cavity damping rate , @xmath61 , and the vacuum - induced coupling on @xmath87 is subject to dephasing at the rate @xmath88 , returning the system to the absolute ground state @xmath12 . whether the dressed system maps onto a ladder or @xmath83 configuration depends on the cavity - atom detuning and the method of probing . for our case , where @xmath89 , direct cavity probing exhibits a narrow dit window with a sub - natural line width equal to @xmath90 . in this expression",
    "we can identify @xmath91 as the coherent scattering rate predicted by purcell and @xmath88 as an effective dephasing rate . as long",
    "as the former exceeds the latter , meaning precisely that @xmath41 exceeds 1 , a transparency window emerges in the cavity spectrum .",
    "similarly , the depth of this window depends on @xmath41 , and we are able to observe these effects experimentally because we can adjust the cooperativity in the regime where @xmath92 by varying the density of atoms in the cavity .    in a second method of probing the coupled system , we drive the atoms  rather than the cavity  by illuminating them with a near - resonant beam propagating transverse to the cavity axis , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : analogy](b ) .",
    "this amounts to setting @xmath93 and adding a term @xmath94 to the hamiltonian @xmath56 , with @xmath95 being the probe rabi frequency .",
    "the corresponding steady - state solution for the cavity field is then , @xmath96 figure  [ fig : analogy](d ) shows the calculated number of photons in the cavity for this configuration as a function of the same laser frequency scan , again with @xmath19 . in this case",
    "we have scaled the photon number by @xmath97 to obtain a curve that is independent of the probe strength @xmath95 .",
    "the narrow resonance at @xmath80mhz ( @xmath81 , blue ) does not reveal that the system has two modes , and even with strong coupling at @xmath79ghz ( red ) , the normal modes are barely resolved , in contrast with the cavity - probed case . in the dit language , the roles of atom and cavity are interchanged here , with the atoms acting as the absorber .",
    "now the cavity field in fig .",
    "[ fig : analogy](d ) shows no dit effect even when the condition @xmath47 is satisfied , because the dephasing rate is equal to @xmath61 and the condition @xmath98 prevents the formation of a transparency window in the @xmath99 transition @xcite .      in the experiment we measure the flux of photons travelling from the cavity to a single photon counting module ( methods ) .",
    "this flux , @xmath100 , is related to the intracavity field amplitude , @xmath70 : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the power reflection coefficient of the intput - output coupling mirror and @xmath103 is that of the back mirror .",
    "here we have used the fact that @xmath104 , and that losses at mirror 1 are negligible compared to transmission in our experiment .",

    ", the coherent effect of the atomic dipole is evident as soon as @xmath108 .",
    "in particular it is seen that the reflection minima trace out the avoided crossing of the eigenvalues ( [ eq : undampedeigens ] ) of the undamped hamiltonian , satisfying the condition @xmath109 . that the locations of these features are described independently of the decoherence rates @xmath88 and @xmath61 emphasizes the fact that the underlying coherent properties of the system have been revealed , despite the absence of rabi oscillations .        in the experimental configuration depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : analogy](b ) the coupled system is probed via scattering of incoming radiation by the atoms : the atomic dipole is driven by the probe beam from the side of the cavity and emits radiation at the same frequency into the resonator . according to eq.([eq : flux ] ) with @xmath110 , the built up cavity field is transmitted through the coupling mirror , producing a steady - state flux of @xmath111 photons per unit time , with @xmath70 given by eq.([eq : af ] ) and @xmath112 in our system .",
    "the detected photon count rate is shown in the upper row of fig .",
    "[ fig : fluo ] .",
    "the values of @xmath41 here are lower than in reflection for comparable atomic densities because the side - driven atoms are more weakly coupled to the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "for values of @xmath113 , the emission spectrum is localised around the origin of the @xmath75@xmath105 plane .",
    "comparing eqs.([eq : ar ] ) and ( [ eq : af ] ) , we see that the driven atoms act as a secondary probe source exciting the cavity field with relatively small line width , @xmath88 : @xmath114 as @xmath41 is increased , the atom - cavity coupling leads to a characteristic ` butterfly ' shape in the cavity emission spectrum .",
    "the central feature is split into two broad maxima along the scaled diagonal defined by @xmath115 , centred around @xmath116 .",
    "in contrast with the reflection spectra , the eigenvalues of the undamped hamiltonian are not clearly reflected in the split fluorescence resonances . with the cooperativity and the amplitude of the signal as the only free parameters",

    "we prefer to call this the ` fast cavity ' regime .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> it is usually considered that the spectrum of an optical cavity coupled to an atomic medium does not exhibit a normal - mode splitting unless the system satisfies the  strong coupling \" condition , meaning the rabi frequency of the coherent coupling exceeds the decay rates of atom and cavity excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this need not be the case , but depends on the way in which the coupled system is probed . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the reflection of a probe laser from the input mirror of an overdamped cavity reveal an avoided crossing in the spectrum which is not observed when driving the atoms directly and measuring the purcell - enhanced cavity emission . </S>",
    "<S> we understand these observations by noting a formal correspondence with electromagnetically - induced transparency of a three - level atom in free space , where our cavity acts as the absorbing medium and the coupled atoms play the role of the control field .    </S>",
    "<S> the oscillatory dynamics intrinsic to quantum systems can be harnessed in a number of ways for advanced applications in metrology and sensing . </S>",
    "<S> coherent oscillations among quantum states are at the heart of existing time - frequency standards @xcite , atom interferometers @xcite , and quantum information processors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coherence in these systems is ultimately limited by dephasing which arises from the coupling of the isolated quantum system to the vast reservoir of states representing the environment . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> the system is _ open _ by design , for example to allow communication of information into and out of the system ; in other cases it is unavoidable , due to losses or the influence of uncontrolled fluctuations in the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the exact role of decoherence in the transition from microscopic quantum to macroscopic classical behaviour remains an active field of study @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we study a system comprising cold atoms coupled to a high finesse optical microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively small cavity mode volume results in a large electric dipole coupling between a single photon and an atom . </S>",
    "<S> this comes at the price of a fast optical decoherence rate due to transmission and losses from the cavity mode into external modes . despite this , </S>",
    "<S> we show how the hamiltonian eigenstates of the system can be revealed through spectroscopic measurements . by probing the cavity with an incident field , we realize an analogy to electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in which the coherent atom - cavity coupling plays the role of the control field . the effective three - level system is formed by the lowest triplet of dressed states of the coupled atom - cavity complex . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this as _ dressing - induced transparency _ ( dit ) , and it is complementary to cavity - induced transparency as proposed in @xcite , with the roles of cavity and atom here reversed . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - natural width of the dit window depends on the coherent atom - cavity coupling strength . because of this , we are able to observe an avoided crossing in the dressed cavity spectrum , usually taken as evidence of strong coupling , despite the complete overdamping of rabi oscillations in our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we also control the width of the dit window through the density dependence of the atomic dipole . </S>",
    "<S> the analogy to eit also highlights the existence of steep dispersion present in the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with conventional eit of three - level atoms in optical cavities @xcite , it is possible in our system to swap the roles of longitudinal and transverse dephasing rates , corresponding to decay of populations and coherences , respectively . when the probe laser is incident on the atoms directly ( from the side of the cavity ) , dit per se is not present . </S>",
    "<S> however , the spectral width of the narrow feature in this case is the same as for the dressing - induced transparency window with the same parameters , casting new light on the well - known purcell effect describing coherent scattering into the cavity mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that even in a highly overdamped regime , quantum interference can be used to reveal aspects of the coherent coupling . </S>"
