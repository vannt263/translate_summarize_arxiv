    "the understanding of the observed pattern of quark and lepton masses and mixings remains as one of the most important open questions in particle physics . from experiment",
    ", we believe that nature contains three families of quarks and leptons , with peculiar mass hierarchies . moreover , there is firm evidence that the flavour structure in both quark and lepton sectors is far from trivial , as exhibited by the current bounds on the quark  @xcite and lepton  @xcite mixing matrices .",
    "the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions ( sm ) fails in explaining some important issues such as the fermion flavour structure or the number of fermion families we encounter in nature .",
    "moreover , the mechanism of mass generation for quarks and leptons is still unconfirmed , since the higgs boson is yet to be discovered in a collider .",
    "other high - energy motivated theories , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) , supergravity ( sugra ) , or grand unified theories ( guts ) may repair some shortcomings of the sm ( as for instance the hierarchy problem , the existence of particles with distinct spin , or the unification of gauge interactions ) , but they still fail in providing a clear understanding of the nature of masses , mixings and number of families . in this sense ,",
    "a crucial ingredient to relate theory and observation is the precise knowledge of how fermions and higgs scalars interact , in other words , the yukawa couplings of the fundamental theory .",
    "string theory is the only candidate to unify all known interactions ( strong , electroweak and gravitational ) in a consistent way , and therefore it must necessarily contain the sm as its low - energy limit . in this sense , string theory must provide an answer to the above mentioned questions . a very interesting method to obtain a four dimensional effective theory",
    "is the compactification of the @xmath2 heterotic string  @xcite on six - dimensional orbifolds  @xcite , and this has proved to be a very successful attempt at finding the superstring standard model  @xcite ( other interesting attempts at model building using calabi - yau spaces  @xcite , fermionic constructions  @xcite , and heterotic m - theory  @xcite , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite , respectively ) . as it was shown in  @xcite",
    ", the use of two wilson lines  @xcite on the torus defining a symmetric @xmath0 orbifold can give rise to susy models with @xmath3 gauge group and three families of chiral particles with the correct @xmath4 quantum numbers .",
    "these models present very attractive features from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "one of the @xmath5s of the extended gauge group is in general anomalous , and it can induce a fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) @xmath6-term  @xcite that would break susy at very high energies ( fi scale @xmath7 gev ) ) . to preserve susy , some fields will develop a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to cancel the undesirable @xmath6-term .",
    "the fi mechanism allows to break the gauge group down to @xmath8 and obtain the mass spectrum of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , plus some exotic matter , as extra singlets , doublets or vector - like triplets , depending on the model , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "orbifold compactifications have other remarkable properties .",
    "for instance , they provide a geometric mechanism to generate the mass hierarchy for quarks and leptons  @xcite through renormalisable yukawa couplings .",
    "@xmath9 orbifolds have twisted fields which are attached to the orbifold fixed points .",
    "fields at different fixed points may communicate with each other only by world sheet instantons .",
    "the resulting renormalisable yukawa couplings can be explicitly computed  @xcite and they receive exponential suppression factors that depend on the distance between the fixed points to which the relevant fields are attached .",
    "these distances can be varied by giving different vevs to the @xmath10-moduli associated with the size and the shape of the orbifold .",
    "however , the major problem that one encounters when trying to obtain models with entirely renormalisable yukawas lies at the phenomenological level , and is deeply related to obtaining the correct quark mixing . summarising the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite , for prime orbifolds the space group selection rules and the need for a fermion hierarchy forces the fermion mass matrices to be diagonal at the renormalisable level .",
    "thus , in these cases , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) parameters must arise at the non - renormalisable level .",
    "for analyses of non - prime orbifolds see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for example , since the fi breaking generates vevs for fields of order @xmath11 gev , if one has terms in the superpotential of the type @xmath12 , these would produce couplings of order @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , depending on @xmath14 , different values for the couplings might be generated .",
    "obviously , the presence of these couplings is very model - dependent and introduces a high degree of uncertainty in the computation .",
    "however , it is important to remark that having the latter couplings is not always allowed in string constructions .",
    "first of all , they must be gauge - invariant , something that is not easy to achieve , due to the large number of @xmath5 charges which are associated to the particles in these models .",
    "even if the couplings fulfil this condition , this does not mean that they are automatically allowed .",
    "they must still fulfil the so - called `` stringy '' selection rules .",
    "for example in the @xmath15 model of ref .",
    "@xcite , where renormalisable couplings are present , only a small number of non - renormalisable terms are allowed by gauge invariance .",
    "nevertheless , even the latter terms turn out to be forbidden by string selection rules .",
    "clearly , purely renormalisable yukawa couplings are preferable , because , in general , due to the arbitrariness of the vevs of the fields entering the non - renormalisable couplings , the predictivity is lost .",
    "furthermore , as discussed above , higher - order operators such as those induced by the fi breaking are very model - dependent .",
    "one possibility of avoiding the necessity of these non - renormalisable couplings is to relax the requirement of a minimal matter content ( with just two higgs doublets ) in a @xmath0 orbifold with two wilson lines .",
    "since these models naturally contain three families of everything , including higgses , additional yukawa couplings will be present , with the possibility of leading to realistic fermion masses and mixings , entirely at the renormalisable level ( with a key role being played by the fi breaking )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , and given the existence of three families of quarks and leptons , having also three families of higgses renders these models very aesthetic .",
    "in fact , let us recall that experimental data imposes no constraints on the number of higgs families .",
    "moreover , this non - minimal higgs content , provided that the extra doublets are light enough to be present at low - energies , also favours the unification of gauge couplings in heterotic string constructions . due to the fi scale",
    ", the gauge couplings may unify at the string scale ( @xmath16 gev )  @xcite .",
    "thus , this class of string compactifications is one of the scenarios where one can obtain a sm / mssm compatible low - energy theory , albeit with an extended higgs sector .",
    "furthermore it offers a solution to the flavour problem of the sm and mssm , since the structure of the yukawa couplings is completely derived from the geometry of the high - energy string construction .",
    "given the increasing experimental accuracy , accommodating the data on quark masses and mixings is not straightforward .",
    "in this work , we propose to investigate in detail whether or not it is possible to obtain @xmath0 orbifold configurations that successfully reproduce the observed flavour pattern in nature . in this sense",
    ", having additional yukawa couplings presents several advantages , as for example a greater flexibility when fitting the data from the quark masses and mixings .",
    "on the other hand , when working in a multi - higgs context , we should also take into account the potential appearance of flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at the tree level , which could contribute to a wide variety of higgs decays and interactions with other particles  @xcite .",
    "generally , the most stringent limit to these flavour - changing processes is assumed to come from the mass difference of the long- and short - lived neutral kaons , @xmath17 . a possible way to overcome",
    "this problem is by imposing that the higgs spectrum is heavy enough to suppress the undesired contributions to the neutral meson mass differences .",
    "as we will see , the yukawa couplings of this @xmath0 scenario exhibit a strongly hierarchical structure , and this property is instrumental in circumventing the fcnc problem without the need for an excessively heavy higgs sector .",
    "@xmath0 orbifolds are also very attractive when addressing the lepton sector , and in fact offer an appealing scenario to study the problem of neutrino masses ( predicting naturally small dirac masses , and thus a low see - saw scale ) .",
    "we postpone this analysis to a forthcoming work  @xcite .",
    "this work is organised as follows . in section  [ yukawa ] , we describe the main properties of the yukawa couplings in @xmath0 orbifold models .",
    "we study the relations between the several orbifold parameters induced from the quark mass hierarchy and from electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "section  [ higgsphenom ] is devoted to a brief overview of the extended higgs sector . in section  [ yukint ]",
    "we present the contributions of neutral higgs exchange to tree - level fcncs .",
    "the numerical analyses of the orbifold parameter space and fcncs in association with specific higgs textures is given in section  [ results ] , where we also address the possibility of new contributions to indirect cp violation .",
    "finally , we summarise our results in section  [ conc ] .",
    "in this section we review some of the most relevant features of the geometrical construction of the @xmath0 orbifold leading to the computation of the quark mass matrices .",
    "we study the correlations of the orbifold parameters arising from the quark mass hierarchy and electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking conditions , and derive useful relations which play an important role in constraining the parameter space .",
    "the @xmath0 orbifold is constructed by dividing @xmath19 by the @xmath20 ^ 3 $ ] root lattice modded by the point group ( p ) with generator @xmath21 , where the action of @xmath21 on the lattice basis is @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "the two - dimensional sublattices associated to @xmath20 ^ 3 $ ] are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbipicture ] .",
    "invariance under the point group reduces the orbifold deformation parameters to nine : the three radii of the sublattices and the six angles between complex planes .",
    "the latter parameters correspond to the vevs of nine singlet fields appearing in the spectrum of the untwisted sector , and which have perturbatively flat potentials .",
    "these so - called moduli fields are usually denoted by @xmath10 .    in orbifold constructions ,",
    "twisted strings appear attached to fixed points under the point group . in the case of the @xmath0 orbifold",
    "there are 27 fixed points under p , and therefore 27 twisted sectors .",
    "we will denote the three fixed points of each two - dimensional lattice as in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbipicture ] . in the @xmath0 orbifold ,",
    "the general form of the yukawa couplings between the twisted fields is given by a jacobi theta function , and their expressions can be found , for example , in the appendix of ref .",
    "the yukawa couplings contain suppression factors that depend on the relative positions of the fixed points to which the the fields involved in the coupling are attached , and on the size and shape of the orbifold ( i.e. the deformation parameters ) .",
    "let us first study the situation before taking into account the effect of the fi breaking .",
    "let us suppose that the two non - vanishing wilson lines correspond to the first and second sublattices .",
    "then , the 27 twisted sectors come in nine sets with three equivalent sectors in each one .",
    "the three generations of matter ( including higgses ) correspond to changing the third sublattice component ( @xmath25 ) of the fixed point , while keeping the other two fixed .",
    "consider for example the following assignments of observable matter to fixed point components in the first two sublattices , @xmath26 in this case , the up- and down - quark mass matrices are given by  @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 is the gauge coupling constant , and @xmath30 is related to the volume of the @xmath0 lattice unit cell such that @xmath31 . in the above matrices @xmath32 denote the vevs of the neutral components of the six higgs doublet fields , @xmath33 , we use @xmath34 , @xmath35 , with odd ( even ) cases referring to down- ( up- ) quark coupling higgses . ] . since we are assuming an orthogonal lattice , i.e. with the six angles equal to zero , only the diagonal moduli ( @xmath36 ) , which are related with the radii of the three sublattices ] , contribute to the yukawa couplings , through the suppression factors @xmath37 @xmath38      as mentioned in the introduction , the anomalous @xmath5 of the extended @xmath39 gauge group generates a fayet - iliopoulos @xmath6-term which could in principle break susy at energies close to the string scale .",
    "this term can be cancelled when scalar fields ( @xmath40 ) , which are singlets under @xmath41 , develop large vevs ( @xmath42 gev ) .",
    "the vevs of these fields ( @xmath43 ) , have several important effects .",
    "firstly , they break the original @xmath39 gauge group down to the ( ms)sm @xmath44 . secondly",
    ", they induce very large effective mass terms for many particles ( vector - like triplets and doublets , as well as singlets ) , which thus decouple from the low - energy theory .",
    "even so , the sm matter remains massless , surviving as the zero mass mode of combinations with the other ( massive ) states .",

    "more complicated examples would in principle give rise to a contribution to the cp phase  @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , one should bear in mind the fact that mixing in the @xmath148 sector is very sensitive to the hadronic model used to estimate the transition amplitudes , and there is still a very large uncertainty in deriving its decay constants , etc .",
    "therefore , the constraints on a given model arising from @xmath154 should not be over - emphasised , and we will adopt this conservative view throughout our discussion .",
    "another interesting issue is that of rare decays .",
    "it has been argued that , again when no theory for the full yukawas is available , some rare decays become very sensitive to flavour changing contributions induced by higgs exchange at the tree - level  @xcite . in the present model ,",

    "in the present scenario , most of the observables addressed in the previous section receive their dominant contributions from tree - level processes .",

    "firstly , we focus on the string sector of the model , and for each point in the space generated by the free parameters of the orbifold ( @xmath164 ) , we derive the up- and down - quark mass matrices ) ( and in all subsequent relations ) are used on the sole purpose of obtaining an approximate determination of the vevs .",
    "afterwards , the actual values of @xmath165 are exactly computed . ] and compute the ckm matrix .",
    "this procedure allows us to investigate the several regimes of parameters that translate into viable quark spectra , and discuss the implications of the relations between the several parameters . at this early stage",

    "( [ wmbeta],[auad : rel ] ) ) .",
    "another possible approach would be to scan over the space generated by the moduli ( @xmath36 ) and the vevs of the @xmath41 singlet fields ( @xmath43 ) , but this would translate in less straightforward relations between the orbifold parameters and the experimental data .",
    "a secondary step requires specifying the several higgs parameters , which must obey the minimum criteria of eq .",
    "( [ minima : du ] ) .",
    "finally , the last step comprehends the analysis of how each of the yukawa patterns constrains the higgs parameters in order to have compatibility with the fcnc data . in particular",

    "as discussed in  @xcite , there are three regimes for the values of @xmath166 and @xmath167 , depending on the specific orbifold configuration :    \\(a ) @xmath168 and @xmath169 ;    \\(b ) @xmath170 and @xmath171 ;    \\(c ) @xmath172 and @xmath169 .    in any case",

    "the present orbifold model does not include a specific prediction regarding the higgs sector .",
    "for instance , we have no hint regarding the value of the several bilinear terms , nor towards their origin .",
    "concerning the soft breaking terms , the situation is identical . since the fi @xmath6-term , which could have broken susy at the string scale ,",
    "was cancelled , one must call upon some other mechanism to ensure that supersymmetry is indeed broken in the low - energy theory . in the absence of further information",

    "( [ vdvfvs ] ) , taking the higgs soft breaking masses and the @xmath179-terms as free parameters ( provided that the ew symmetry breaking and minimisation conditions are verified ) .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is important to stress that the higgs spectrum ( i.e. the scalar and pseudoscalar physical masses ) can not be a direct input when investigating the occurrence of fcncs . in some previous studies of fcncs in multi - higgs doublets models",
    "( see for example  @xcite ) the bounds were derived for the diagonal entries in the scalar and pseudoscalar mass matrices .",
    "however , this approach neglects mixings between the several fields @xmath180 , and excludes the exchange of some scalar and pseudoscalar states .",
    "although it is possible to begin the analysis from the original basis ( where all neutral higgses develop vevs ) , we prefer to define the higgs parameters on the higgs - basis , relying on the minima conditions ( and associated inequalities ) to ensure that we are on the presence of true minima . therefore , the parameters that must be specified are : @xmath181 entering in eq .",
    "( [ minima : du ] ) . in the absence of orbifold predictions for the higgs sector parameters , and motivated by an argument of simplicity , we begin our analysis by considering textures for the above parameters as simple as possible .    to avoid rewriting the higgs soft - breaking masses ,",
    "we adopt the following parameterisation : @xmath182 in the above , @xmath183 should be understood as the @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) submatrices of the @xmath186 matrix that encodes the rotated soft - breaking higgs masses in the higgs basis ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath187 denotes an entry which is fixed by the minima equations of eq .",

    "regarding the value of @xmath79 , and if not otherwise stated , we shall take @xmath188 in the subsequent analysis .",
    "we first consider the following four cases , presenting the associated scalar and pseudoscalar higgs spectra :    * @xmath189 + @xmath190 gev ; + @xmath191 gev .",

    "> from fig .",
    "[ fig : dmk ] it is clear that it is quite easy for the orbifold model to accommodate the current experimental values for @xmath138 . even though the model presents the possibility of important tree - level contributions to the kaon mass difference , all the textures considered give rise to contributions very close to the experimental value .",
    "although ( a ) and ( b ) are not in agreement with the measured value of @xmath138 , their contribution is within order of magnitude of @xmath202 . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : dmk ] , with a considerably light higgs spectrum ( i.e. @xmath203 tev ) , one is safely below the experimental bound , as exhibited by cases ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected given the strongly hierarchical structure of the yukawa couplings ( notice from eq .",
    "( [ yd:1:5 ] ) that @xmath204 is suppressed by @xmath70 )",
    ".    one important aspect clearly manifest in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmk ] , and which has been overlooked in some previous analyses , is that the higgs mixings can be as relevant as the higgs eigenvalues in determining the contributions to @xmath138 .",
    "this is patent in the comparison of curves ( c ) and ( d ) . from a nave inspection of the higgs spectra associated to each case",
    ", one would expect that ( c ) would induce a much stronger suppression to the model s contribution to @xmath152 . nevertheless , case ( d ) , with a spectrum quite similar to case ( b ) , and indeed much lighter than that of ( d ) , but with much smaller mixings , is the one associated with the strongest suppression of @xmath138 .    it is also important to comment on the effect of changing @xmath79 regarding the contributions to the kaon mass difference .",
    "for the specific case of texture ( c ) , let us investigate the effect of varying @xmath79 .",
    "we take the quark masses as in set b , and while keeping the higgs parameters fixed , @xmath79 is taken in the range @xmath205 . as it becomes clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : dmk : tb ] , larger values of @xmath79 produce increasingly larger contributions to @xmath138 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that , due to larger off - diagonal terms in the higgs mass matrices , the mixing is larger , and the corresponding eigenstates become lighter . even though the masses of the heaviest states remain stable , the intermediate states become lighter , and the fcnc contributions are less suppressed . close to @xmath79=10 , it is no longer possible to find physical minima of the higgs potential , and tachyonic states emerge .",
    "this effect has been already pointed out in the general analysis of  @xcite .      for the several parameterisations of the higgs sector used for the analysis of @xmath138 , we display in fig .  [",
    "fig : dmbd ] the contributions of higgs textures ( a)-(d ) to the @xmath208 mass difference .",
    "c    as one would expect , given the structure of the mass matrices ( and thus the yukawa couplings ) , the present model generates very small contributions to @xmath153 .",
    "all the textures analysed , even those associated with excessive contributions to @xmath138 are in good agreement with the experimental data on the @xmath146 mass difference .",
    "notice that the behaviour of the textures is now quite distinct : as an example , texture ( b ) , which generated the second largest contribution to the @xmath138 is now the one associated with the strongest suppression .",
    "this stems from the fact that the leading contributions are now given by distinct higgses , whose couplings to the quarks need not be identical .    likewise , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmbs ] we plot the contributions to the @xmath209 mass difference . in this case experiment only provides a lower bound , so that any ratio larger than 1 is in agreement with current data .",
    "c    as we would expect from the discussion of section  [ yukint ] , this model s contributions to @xmath210 are well above the current limit .",
    "the cases ( a)-(d ) considered in the previous subsections generate contributions to @xmath154 that exceed the experimental bounds by at least a factor 10 . as discussed in section  [ yukint ] , this is not surprising , nor excessively worrying . nevertheless , and for the sake of completing the analysis , let us consider four additional higgs patterns , in order to derive a bound on the mass of the heaviest higgs boson that would render the model compatible with the data from the @xmath148 sector .",
    "the new higgs textures are defined as follows :    * @xmath212 + @xmath213 gev ; + @xmath214 gev .",
    "* @xmath215 + @xmath216 gev ; + @xmath217 gev . * @xmath218 + @xmath219 gev ; + @xmath220 gev .",

    "[ fig : dmd ] the contributions to @xmath154 .",
    "c    compatibility with experiment can be obtained for any of the sets ( e ) , ( g ) or ( h ) , thus suggesting that one of the higgses ( a state mostly dominated by an up - type higgs field ) must be at least of around 7.5  tev .",
    "notice that no major hierarchy is required from the higgs spectrum - case ( e ) is an excellent example of the latter statement , in the sense that one obtains states softly ranging from 600 to 7500 gev .",
    "one may wonder if such a choice of higgs soft - breaking terms may lead to a fine - tuning problem . in  @xcite , it was pointed out that for non - degenerate vevs , soft - breaking terms above the few tev range typically induced a fine tuning stronger than 1% .",
    "nevertheless , we again stress that these values for the higgs masses ( as derived from the @xmath148 mass difference analysis ) should not be interpreted from a very strict point of view .      finally , we turn our attention to the issue of cp violation .",
    "so far , we have seen that accommodating the several @xmath225 observables is not an excessively hard task ( especially if we choose to set aside the @xmath148 sector ) .",
    "nevertheless , a successful model of particle physics must also comply with the observed cp violation in the kaon sector . as we mentioned in section  [ yukint ]",
    ", we will only consider the specific contribution of the present model to indirect cp violation in the kaon sector ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore , we now assume @xmath59 ( and thus @xmath57 ) to be a complex quantity , and parameterise it as @xmath226 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ek ] we present the tree - level contributions to @xmath1 ( normalised by its experimental value ) as a function of @xmath227 .",

    "these phases are taken as illustrative examples ; we choose values that for a specific set of input quark masses ( set b , in this case ) and a given higgs texture ( c)-(e ) simultaneously succeed in generating an amount of @xmath1 close to the value experimentally measured ( range delimited by dotted grey lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ek ] ) , and still have a compatible ckm .",
    "one should bare in mind that once @xmath231 ( and thus @xmath232 ) is no longer a small number , it will significantly affect the computation of the yukawa couplings , and thus the ckm matrix .",
    "c    we have considered one texture that accommodates all fcnc observables , namely texture ( e ) , which already has a somewhat heavy higgs spectrum . in this case , the phase required to saturate @xmath233 is @xmath234 . since we do not wish to view the @xmath148 sector as a very stringent constraint , we also consider two other higgs patterns , ( c ) and ( d ) , which only succeed in complying with both kaon and @xmath235-meson data . in these cases , the phases necessary to obtain @xmath233 are now @xmath236 , as one would expect , since a lighter set of higgs bosons typically enhances the contributions .    in the range of parameters analysed in this plot ,",
    "the amount of cp violation stemming from the ckm matrix is @xmath237 , i.e. at least one order of magnitude below the sm value that is associated with the observed @xmath1  @xcite",
    ". the possibility of obtaining an orbifold configuration that saturates the observed value of @xmath1 and at the same time allows to reproduce the @xmath238 required by the unitarity triangle fits should not be discarded .",
    "it is clear that the phase of @xmath59 must be quite large , and  such values would push us to distinct areas of the orbifold parameter space .",
    "it is worth emphasising that there are still other sources of cp violation in addition to the one we have studied in this section . as mentioned in footnote  [ cpfoot ] , a more complicated choice of the vevs @xmath43 could lead to physical phases in the quark masses matrices , which would in turn contribute to the physical ckm phase .",
    "in this work we have investigated whether it is possible to find abelian @xmath0 orbifold configurations that are associated with an experimentally viable low - energy scenario .    this class of models provides a beautiful geometric mechanism for the generation of the fermion mass hierarchy .",
    "the yukawa couplings are explicitly calculable , and thus a solution to the elusive flavour problem of the sm and mssm can in principle be obtained .",
    "we have concentrated here in @xmath0 orbifold compactifications with two wilson lines , which naturally include three families for fermions and higgses .",
    "the fact that additional yukawas are present opens the possibility of obtaining realistic fermion masses and mixings , entirely at the renormalisable level ( with a key role being played by the fi breaking ) .",
    "we have surveyed the parameter space generated by the free orbifold parameters , and we have verified that one can find configurations that obey the ew symmetry breaking conditions , and can account for the correct quark masses and mixings .",
    "on the other hand , having six higgs doublets ( and thus six quark yukawa couplings ) poses the potential problem of having tree - level fcncs . by assuming simple textures for the higgs free parameters",
    ", we have verified that the experimental data on the neutral kaon mass difference , as well as on @xmath153 and @xmath210 can be easily accommodated for a quite light higgs spectra , namely @xmath239  tev .",
    "the data from the @xmath148 sector proves to be a more difficult challenge , requiring a higgs spectrum of at least 7 tev , but we again stress that , in view of the theoretical and experimental uncertainties associated with the @xmath148 sector , this constraint should not be over - emphasised .",
    "cp violation can be also embedded into the low - energy theory .",
    "although cp is a gauge symmetry of the full theory , it can be spontaneously broken at the string scale , if the vevs of the moduli have a non - vanishing phase .",
    "we have parameterised these effects by assuming the presence of a phase in @xmath59 , and we have verified that one can also obtain a value for @xmath1 in agreement with current experimental data .",
    "the presence of a fairly light higgs spectrum , composed by a total of 21 physical states , may provide abundant experimental signatures at future colliders , like the tevatron or the lhc .",
    "in fact , flavour violating decays of the form @xmath240 , or @xmath241 may provide the first clear evidence of this class of models .",
