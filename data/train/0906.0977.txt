    "our knowledge of stellar evolution relies heavily on constraints provided by measurements of the physical properties of stars , particularly the mass .",
    "eclipsing binaries have been our main source of accurate information for stars on the main sequence ( masses , radii , effective temperatures , luminosities ) .",
    "the more advanced stages of evolution , after the central hydrogen is exhausted , are much less well understood than the main - sequence phase primarily because of poorer or less stringent constraints .",
    "accurate masses are rarely available for normal giant stars , for practical reasons that are well known : it requires them to be in binaries , and it requires the orbits to be wide enough so that the components are detached ( i.e. , that they do not interact with each other in the sense of mass transfer ) .",
    "this in turn calls for sustained observations over long periods of time , often several years .",
    "the radial - velocity amplitudes are typically low , making the masses more difficult to measure accurately .",
    "eclipses are also much less likely , robbing us in most cases of the possibility of determining the absolute radii directly .    while precious few normal giants or subgiants are known to be in eclipsing binaries ( examples include ai  phe , tz  for , and the system ogle 051019.64@xmath12685812.3 in the lmc ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , non - eclipsing systems amenable to both spectroscopic and astrometric studies enabling accurate dynamical mass determinations are somewhat more common .",
    "a very prominent example of this class of objects is capella ( @xmath13  aurigae , hd  34029 , hr  1708 , hip  24608 , + , @xmath14 days ) , the 6th brightest star in the sky ( @xmath15 ) , and the first binary for which an astrometric orbit was determined interferometrically @xcite .",
    "although other astrometric measurements have been gathered for capella over the decades using a variety of techniques , those pioneering observations with the original michelson interferometer on mount wilson have remained a critical component of the astrometric solution of the orbit , which until about 15 years ago contributed the dominant share of the uncertainty in the resulting masses . at that time @xcite used the mark  iii interferometer , also on mount wilson , to obtain measurements that are an order of magnitude more precise . as a result",
    ", our knowledge of the masses is now limited by the best - available spectroscopy @xcite rather than the astrometry , a somewhat embarrassing situation given the brightness of the object and its 100-year observational history .",
    "the masses are currently estimated to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the cooler primary and the secondary , respectively . although these are seemingly quite precise ( @xmath112% relative errors ) , the _ accuracy _ is just as important , especially for giants .",
    "the predicted properties of stars from stellar evolution models in these rapid evolutionary stages are extremely sensitive to mass , and a 2% error makes a much larger difference than on the main sequence",
    ".    systematic errors in the radial velocity measurements for the rapidly - rotating secondary of capella are not easy to avoid , and as a result there have been persistent concerns in the literature about the accuracy of the mass ratio , which is very close to unity .",
    "this quantity has a significant impact on the precise evolutionary state inferred for the components .",
    "one of our motivations here is thus to provide a new , high - quality set of spectroscopic observations that more nearly matches the precision of the astrometric data of @xcite .",
    "we focus especially on the accuracy of the mass determinations , for the purpose of comparing with state - of - the - art stellar evolution models .",
    "considerable effort is therefore invested in the inter - comparison of all available astrometric and spectroscopic observations , in order to properly understand the systematics .",
    "an additional goal of this work is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of all the data relevant for the determination of the evolutionary state of capella , which has been a subject of debate for decades .",
    "the secondary is clearly crossing the hertzprung gap , but the primary has been suggested to be either in the helium - burning clump or on the first ascent of the giant branch , usually based on partial information .",
    "this system is perhaps unique in that , in addition to the masses , effective temperatures , and luminosities that have been used previously for that purpose , a wealth of other information is available .",
    "this includes direct measurements of the angular diameters , various activity indicators in the optical , ultraviolet , and x rays , the projected rotational velocities as well as the rotation periods , the overall metallicity , and particularly the surface lithium abundance of both stars , the @xmath9c/@xmath10c isotope ratio for the primary star , and the c / n abundance ratios .",
    "chemical indicators such as these are crucial diagnostics of evolution because they change significantly in the giant phase , mainly during the first dredge - up .",
    "we bring all of these to bear here , for the first time .",
    "we wish to examine the effects of convection prescriptions in the models ( mixing length , overshooting ) as well as rotation , which has not previously been considered for this system .",
    "furthermore , capella is an important point of comparison with tidal evolution theory for evolved stars .",
    "this is because the primary has its rotation synchronized with the orbital motion while the secondary rotates 12 times faster than synchronous , despite the nearly identical masses , which are within 1% of each other .",
    "thus another goal of this work is to use our newly derived accurate dimensions for the components to carry out a detailed check of current tidal theories and gauge our understanding of these processes .",
    "our new spectroscopic observations are presented in  [ sec : spectroscopy ] , along with all historical radial - velocity measurements .",
    "the astrometric observations are discussed in  [ sec : astrometry ] , and include long - baseline interferometry , speckle interferometry , and _ hipparcos _ measurements .",
    "our simultaneous orbital solution for capella based on these two kinds of data is documented in ",
    "[ sec : orbit ] , with particular care given to possible systematic errors that might bias the masses . in ",
    "[ sec : lightratio ] and  [ sec : angdiam ] we collect all the information available on the relative brightness of the components and the angular diameters , which we use later to estimate effective temperatures and absolute radii .",
    "the chemical composition of capella is discussed in  [ sec : abundances ] , and proves to be of critical importance for the analysis .",
    "the physical properties of the stars are then described in ",
    "[ sec : dimensions ] .",
    "we present a detailed comparison of the absolute dimensions of capella with stellar evolution theory in  [ sec : discussion ] , focusing on the determination of the evolutionary state of the stars . in the same section",
    "we carry out tests of current tidal theories . finally ,  [ sec : finalremarks ] summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "two appendices collect notes of interest on the astrometric observations for the benefit of future users , and a third contains a discussion of the coronal abundances of capella that support the photospheric determinations .",
    "the rich history of the radial - velocity measurements of capella began more than a century ago with the pioneering efforts by the greenwich and potsdam astronomers @xcite , and has been recounted previously by other authors ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "more than a dozen semi - independent spectroscopic orbital solutions have been reported over the decades , based on data sets of greatly varying quality . despite the brightness of the object , the radial velocity measurements of the rotationally broadened secondary component are not particularly easy , and have not always been possible in the past . as a result",
    ", there has been considerable debate about the mass ratio ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which our analysis conclusively shows is near unity .",
    "nevertheless , some of these historical data are still of value to improve the orbital period , so we describe them in some detail below and make use of them later .",
    "our main observational contribution here is a large new set of high - quality velocity measurements for both components that provides more than a two - fold improvement in the precision of the velocity semi - amplitude of the primary , and a four - fold improvement for the secondary compared to the best existing determinations , by @xcite .",
    "these new data are described first .",
    "spectroscopic observations of capella were conducted at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) using the 1.5 m wyeth reflector at the oak ridge observatory ( harvard , massachusetts ) , beginning in 1996 october and continuing through 1999 november .",
    "an echelle spectrograph with a photon - counting intensified reticon detector ( digital speedometer ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used to record a single 45  echelle order centered at a wavelength of 5188.5 , featuring the gravity - sensitive lines of the  b triplet .",
    "the resolving power provided by this setup is @xmath18 .",
    "one additional observation was gathered with a nearly identical system on the 1.5 m tillinghast reflector at the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( mount hopkins , arizona ) .",
    "nominal signal - to - noise ratios per resolution element of 8.5  kms@xmath19range from about 20 to 90 , although for values much higher than 50 the limit is set by systematics from flat - fielding and not photon noise . with the inclusion of two archival observations made in 1986 february and march with the instrument at oak ridge , the total number of usable spectra is 162 , collected over an interval of 13.8 years",
    ".    radial velocities for both stars were derived using todcor , a two - dimensional cross - correlation technique introduced by @xcite .",
    "this method uses two templates , one for each component of the binary , which we selected from a large library of synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres by r.  l.  kurucz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these templates have been calculated for a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath20 ) , surface gravities ( @xmath21 ) , rotational velocities ( @xmath22 when seen in projection ) , and metallicities ( [ m / h ] ) .",
    "following @xcite the optimum templates for capella were determined by means of extensive grids of cross - correlations with todcor , seeking to maximize the average correlation weighted by the strength of each exposure . the surface gravities were held fixed at preliminary values of @xmath23 and 3.0 for the primary and secondary , and the metallicity was initially assumed to be solar . as a result of this optimization we obtained by interpolation effective temperatures of @xmath24  k and @xmath25  k for the primary and secondary , respectively , along with projected rotational velocities of @xmath26 kms@xmath19  and @xmath27 kms@xmath19 .",
    "strictly speaking , the latter values are a measure of the total broadening of the spectral lines .",
    "we discuss these measures and compare them with others in ",
    "[ sec : dimensions ] .",
    "we repeated these determinations assuming metallicities of [ m / h ] @xmath28 , @xmath120.5 , and + 0.5 , but we found the average correlation values to be slightly lower than with solar metallicity , indicating a poorer match to the observed spectra .",
    "the templates adopted here are the ones in our library with parameters nearest to the values above : @xmath29  k and 5750  k for the primary and secondary , and rotational velocities of 6  kms@xmath19  and 35  kms@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the radial velocities derived in this way have internal errors averaging 0.5 kms@xmath19  and 1.0 kms@xmath19  for the primary and secondary , but vary individually depending on the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in addition to the radial velocities , our spectra yield the light ratio at the mean wavelength of our spectra , @xmath30 . the difference in line blocking between the components has been accounted for , so that this represents a true flux ratio rather than a ratio between the continuum levels .",
    "the hotter star is thus brighter at @xmath115200 .",
    "the stability of the zero - point of the cfa velocity system was monitored by means of exposures of the dusk and dawn sky , and small systematic run - to - run corrections were applied in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "the zero point of the native cfa velocity system based on synthetic templates is very close to the absolute frame as defined by extensive observations of the minor planets in the solar system .",
    "the correction required to place our radial velocities on this absolute frame is @xmath31 @xcite , and has not been applied to the measurements listed below .",
    "0.5 in 0.05 in    one of the main advantages of todcor compared to conventional one - dimensional cross - correlation techniques is that it greatly reduces the systematic errors in the radial velocities caused by line blending that have affected many of the previous studies of capella ( see  [ sec : spechist ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , because we are concerned in this work with the accuracy of the velocities as much as their precision , we investigated possible systematic effects that may result from residual blending in our narrow spectral window , and from shifts of the spectral lines in and out of this window as a function of orbital phase .",
    "previous experience with similar material has shown that these effects are sometimes significant , and must be examined on a case - by - case basis and corrected if necessary ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we performed numerical simulations as described by @xcite to evaluate these effects .",
    "briefly , we generated synthetic composite spectra matching our observations by combining the primary and secondary templates used above ( including rotational broadening ) , shifted to the appropriate velocities for each of the exposures as predicted by a preliminary orbital solution , and scaled to the observed light ratio .",
    "these synthetic observations were then processed with todcor in exactly the same way as the real spectra , and the resulting velocities were compared with the input shifts .",
    "the differences are shown graphically in figure  [ fig : corrections ] , as a function of both velocity and orbital phase .",
    "the systematic pattern is obvious , and the individual differences can reach @xmath321 kms@xmath19 , which is relatively small in absolute terms but significant compared to the internal errors .",
    "we therefore applied these differences as corrections to the raw velocities .",
    "the effect on the primary semi - amplitude @xmath33 is negligible , but the change in @xmath34 is @xmath110.5% , which translates into a non - negligible change in the derived masses of about 1% for the primary and 0.6% for the secondary .",
    "the final velocities in the heliocentric frame are given in table  [ tab : cfarvs ] , and include these corrections .",
    "similar adjustments based on the same simulations were applied to the light ratio , and are already included in the value reported above .",
    "preliminary single - lined orbital solutions performed separately on the primary and secondary velocities indicated a slight difference in the center - of - mass velocities , @xmath35 , of about @xmath36  kms@xmath19 , with the secondary value being lower .",
    "primary / secondary velocity differences considerably larger than this are not uncommon in studies of double - lined eclipsing binaries .",
    "this difference @xmath37 persisted in our global solution described later .",
    "although it is very small in absolute terms ( only about half of the typical uncertainty in our primary velocities ) , it is statistically significant due to the large number of observations in the fit . because it may affect the absolute masses of capella at some level , we have explored possible reasons for this shift .",
    "one is the differential gravitational redshift between the stars , given that our synthetic templates do not account for this .",
    "estimates based on preliminary values of the masses and radii of the components indicate that this effect is 0.046 kms@xmath19 , but it goes in the wrong direction to explain @xmath37 , i.e. , the secondary redshift is _",
    "larger_. it is also possible there are shifts due to large - scale convective motions @xcite that could be different in the two stars , but these are not well characterized for giants . given that the stars are observed to be active , another possibility is the presence of spots on one or both components ( particularly on the rapidly rotating secondary ) , which can affect the velocities .",
    "a perturbation of this nature was in fact pointed out by @xcite for their interferometric visibilities of capella ( see  [ sec : orbit ] ) .",
    "unfortunately our time sampling is inadequate to study this in more detail , but unless the spots are very long - lived we would expect the effect to average out to some extent over the interval of our observations .",
    "a fourth possibility that can not be completely rule out is template mismatch ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have made every effort here to use templates that maximize the average correlation for all our spectra , and small differences with the true values of @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath38 ( which we estimate below to be @xmath39 for the primary and 2.94 for the secondary ) or metallicity compared to what we have assumed should not have a significant effect on the velocities , in our experience .",
    "however , line broadening from micro- or macro - turbulence in capella could be somewhat different from what is assumed in our library of synthetic spectra ( microturbulence @xmath40  kms@xmath19and macroturbulence @xmath41",
    "kms@xmath19 ) , although this is unlikely to affect the secondary much due to the overwhelming effect of rotational broadening in that star ( 36 kms@xmath19 ) .",
    "we discuss this effect further in ",
    "[ sec : tidal ] in connection with the accuracy of the @xmath22 measurements . in the absence of a definitive explanation",
    ", we have chosen below to correct for the primary / secondary shift by solving for the offset and applying it to the secondary velocities .",
    "not correcting for the shift would affect the semi - amplitudes at the level of 0.03% for the primary and 0.14% for the secondary , and the final masses at the level of 0.31% and 0.22% , which correspond to less than half of the formal uncertainties in our final determination of those quantities ( see  [ sec : dimensions ] ) .",
    "-0.1 in 0.1 in    figure  [ fig : cfaorb ] displays the cfa observations along with an orbital solution described later , as well as the @xmath42 residuals .",
    "those of the secondary show a small residual pattern which we believe to be of a similar nature as the @xmath37 shift discussed above .",
    "we return to this later in connection with the orbital solution .",
    "the discovery of the binary character of capella was announced independently by @xcite and @xcite from photographic spectra taken at lick observatory and cambridge observatory ( england ) , respectively .",
    "both investigators noted the composite nature of the spectrum , but published velocities only for the component newall referred to as being of `` solar type '' . in our nomenclature",
    "this is the cooler , slightly more massive star we refer to as the `` primary '' ( star a ) , which has relatively sharp lines .",
    "the other star ( of `` procyon type '' , `` secondary '' , or star b ) has much more diffuse lines .",
    "@xcite reported only that the velocity of the secondary varies between @xmath43 kms@xmath19  and + 63 kms@xmath19 .",
    "his 31 measurements for the primary are of excellent quality ( @xmath44 kms@xmath19 ) , and were used by @xcite to establish the first reliable spectroscopic orbit .",
    "the measurements by @xcite are somewhat poorer ( @xmath45 kms@xmath19 ) , but still potentially useful .",
    "the first published measurements of the secondary velocity appear to be those by @xcite , who succeeded in detecting it in 19 of his 35 photographic plates taken with a 0.3 m refractor at bonn .",
    "all plates yielded good measurements for the primary .",
    "further velocities for both stars were reported by @xcite from mount wilson , and @xcite from babelsberg .",
    "@xcite published a further series of velocities from mount wilson and lick , though only for the primary star .",
    "measurements of the velocity _ difference _ between the components made at the dominion astrophysical observatory ( dao ) were reported by @xcite , along with a careful study of the secondary spectrum and the relative brightness of that star compared to the primary .",
    "the velocity measurements are averages from plates taken at similar orbital phases , so unique dates can not be assigned to them and for this reason we do not use these data here .",
    "the brightness ratio as well as the mass ratio estimate by @xcite , derived by adopting the primary orbit from @xcite , were quite influential over the following decades , although the light ratio is now known to be incorrect ( or at least misleading ; see  [ sec : lightratio ] and  [ sec : dimensions ] ) .",
    "more recently @xcite published 18 velocities for the primary from plates obtained at dao , most of which were later re - measured by @xcite , superseding the original determinations .",
    "further measurements for both components obtained at the fick observatory were reported by @xcite .",
    "these data were in turn superseded and significantly expanded by @xcite , who published the largest set of velocities for capella aside from our own . additional measurements of the primary only were obtained by @xcite , including a set based on photospheric lines and another set from the chromospheric  @xmath4610830 line .",
    "we do not use the latter because they may not correspond to the true center of mass of the star , nor do we consider a similar list of velocities for both components by @xcite , also from the  @xmath4610830 line .",
    "finally , high - quality measurements for both stars from the mcdonald and kitt peak observatories were published by @xcite .",
    "the sources above represent the most important velocity data sets published for capella in the century since its discovery as a binary . even though some of them may have considerably larger uncertainties ( less weight ) than the cfa velocities , in principle",
    "there is no reason why they can not be properly combined with ours to strengthen the solution , which is our goal in  [ sec : orbit ] . a number of smaller lists of less than half a dozen measurements each have also appeared over the decades , but are ignored here for being much less significant and more difficult to use because of the poorly determined zero - point offsets .",
    "the richer sources are summarized in table  [ tab : historicalorbits ] , where the last entry corresponds to our own contribution .",
    "-0.7 in -0.35 in -0.65 in    the potential usefulness of these historical data sets depends on whether they can be shown to be sufficiently free from systematic errors . to this end",
    ", we have examined each of the sources by computing separate orbital solutions from the original velocities with the same fitting code , and comparing them to one based on the cfa data .",
    "these solutions can be found in table  [ tab : historicalorbits ] .",
    "we list also the number of observations , their time span , and the root - mean - square ( rms ) residual from the fit in each case , which is representative of the typical error of the velocities . because of the limited duration of some of these studies ,",
    "the period has been held fixed at the value @xmath47 days determined from a preliminary fit to our own observations , and the orbit has been assumed to be circular .",
    "the center - of - mass velocities @xmath35 in the second column show that there are occasional differences in the instrumental zero points , although these can easily be corrected in a combined solution by solving for the offsets simultaneously with the other adjustable parameters .",
    "the same holds for the primary / secondary offsets listed in the third column ( see also  [ sec : specnew ] ) , which have been set to zero when a preliminary fit indicated the shift was not significant .",
    "we are more concerned here with the velocity semi - amplitudes @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which determine the masses of the components . excluding the two data sets that rely on chromospheric lines @xcite , the primary semi - amplitudes from all the others agree reasonably well with ours .",
    "the only exception is the data set by @xcite , which is also the smallest .",
    "the secondary semi - amplitudes , however , show significant systematic differences with the cfa value of @xmath34 , and if we restrict ourselves to velocities based on photospheric lines , there appears to be a trend of decreasing amplitudes as a function of time over the last century , leading up to our own determination ( see figure  [ fig : k ] ) .",
    "we suspect these differences have to do with systematic effects associated with line blending and the difficulty of measuring the broad spectral features of the secondary , particularly in the older studies , a problem that has been pointed out repeatedly over the years .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen not to use any of the historical secondary velocities here , relying only on our own .",
    "the primary velocities , on the other hand , appear reasonably free from systematics ( save those of * ? ? ?",

    "soon after the discovery that capella is a spectroscopic binary , some of the most skilled double - star observers of the day attempted to resolve the pair at the times predicted from the spectroscopic orbit to be the most favorable , but they were unsuccessful @xcite . at about the same time , an intriguing series of visual measurements was made at the greenwich observatory that did appear to barely resolve the object : the observers reported elongated images with the 28-inch refractor .",
    "systematic measurements of the position angle of the binary from these elongated images were carried out over an interval of about two years , and rough estimates of the angular separation were also made on a few occasions even though it was far smaller than the resolving power of the telescope .",
    "however , these observations were never confirmed and have been called into question , so we do not use them in our analysis .",
    "nevertheless , a number of fascinating aspects of this puzzling data set are worth noting and are described in more detail in appendix  [ sec : greenwich ] .",

    "are those of @xcite with the mark  iii interferometer on mount wilson , using baselines of 3.0 to 23.6 m. these observations improved the uncertainties in both the position angle and the angular separation by about an order of magnitude compared to previous measures .",

    "all interferometric measurements are listed in table  [ tab : interferometry_polar ] ( for those published in polar coordinates ) and table  [ tab : interferometry_xy ] ( measures published in cartesian coordinates ) .",
    "because of its brightness and convenient angular separation , capella has served for decades as an ideal calibration object for long - baseline interferometry , and has been referred to as `` an interferometrist s friend '' @xcite .",
    "beginning in the 1970s capella was observed also with the speckle interferometry technique by a large number of investigators .",

    "each measurement consisted of a one - dimensional position ( ` abscissa ' , @xmath49 ) along a great circle representing the scanning direction of the satellite , tied to an absolute frame of reference known as the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) .",
    "the typical precision of these measurements is about 2.3 milli - arc seconds ( mas ) for capella .",

    "although the satellite measurements did not actually resolve the pair ( separation @xmath1156 mas ) , the motion of the center of light is large enough that it was clearly detected .",
    "consequently , extra terms were added during the original reductions by the _ hipparcos_team to model this orbital motion and avoid biases .",
    "several of the orbital elements were held fixed at the values from the @xcite study ( period , epoch of nodal passage , inclination angle , position angle of the node ) , and the orbit was assumed to be circular .",

    "they contribute relatively little to the orbit of capella , but they do provide a useful check on the secondary velocity amplitude , to be discussed later .",

    "the quadrant of the position angles has an ambiguity of @xmath52 due to the nature of the measurement . even in cases where the analysis is able to establish the correct quadrant , that determination is made more difficult for capella because the stars are so nearly equal in brightness , as we discuss in  [ sec : lightratio ] , and because the brightness ratio depends on the wavelength of the observation and reverses around 7000 .",
    "here we have adjusted the angles where necessary to be consistent with the usual convention for visual binaries , in which the position angles are measured from the brighter star to the fainter one _ in the v band_.    although many of the above astrometric measurements have been used previously by others to model the orbit of capella , careful examination during the present work of the original references and other bibliographic sources making use of them revealed a number of inconsistencies , misprints , or mistakes that appear not to have been noticed before . as a result ,",

    "the many data sets described above constrain the parameters of capella s orbit in different ways . while it is true",
    "that in this case the interferometric observations by @xcite and our own radial - velocity measurements carry much more weight than other data sets , the optimal procedure for obtaining the orbital parameters is usually to account for the different weights and combine all observations into a single fit , provided they are sufficiently free from systematic errors .",
    "this is the approach we adopt here .",
    "the observations consist of position angles ( @xmath53 ) and angular separations ( @xmath54 ) , measures of the relative separation in rectangular coordinates ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , radial velocities for the primary and secondary , and the _ hipparcos _  measurements @xmath51 .",
    "we solve for the usual orbital elements of a visual - spectroscopic binary , which are the orbital period ( @xmath57 ) , relative angular semi - major axis ( @xmath58 ) , inclination angle ( @xmath59 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath60 ) , longitude of periastron of the secondary ( @xmath61 ) , position angle of the ascending node for the equinox j2000.0 ( @xmath62 ) , time of periastron passage ( @xmath63 ) , center - of - mass velocity ( @xmath35 ) , and the velocity semi - amplitudes for each star ( @xmath33 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "the use of the _ hipparcos _  measurements introduces several additional parameters that must also be solved for .",
    "these are the angular semimajor axis of the photocenter ( @xmath65 ) , corrections to the catalog values of the position of the barycenter ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) at the mean catalog reference epoch of 1991.25 , corrections to the proper motion components ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , and a correction to the _ hipparcos _  parallax . and @xmath70 . ] in this case , however , the fact that the spectroscopic elements @xmath33 and @xmath34 are obtained in the same solution introduces a redundancy , and the parallax ( referred to here as the `` orbital '' parallax ) can be expressed in terms of other elements as @xmath71 the numerical constant is such that the result is in the same units as @xmath58 ( typically mas ) when the period is given in days and @xmath33 and @xmath34 in kms@xmath19 . we have therefore chosen to eliminate the parallax correction as an adjustable parameter in the fit . the mathematical formalism for modeling the _ hipparcos _  abscissa residuals follows closely that described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , including the correlations between measurements from the two independent data reduction consortia that processed the original _ hipparcos _  observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "full details along with another example of the application of this technique may be found in @xcite .",
    "as noted earlier (  [ sec : spechist ] ) , instrumental effects in spectroscopy often cause the zero points of the radial velocity measurements to be different for different observers .",

    "this is hardly surprising given the small magnitude difference between the components at optical wavelengths , and the inherent ambiguities in quadrant determination in some cases .",
    "we discuss this further in  [ sec : lightratio ] .",
    "uncertainties for the astrometric observations were adopted from the original sources , when available , and relative weights within each series were accounted for , if reported . for some of the speckle measurements that have no published errors we adopted typical values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 = 3 mas . with",

    "we have assumed them to be equal to the rms scatter from preliminary orbital fits .",
    "relative weights for the rvs within a given series were taken into account in cases where they were given .",
    "because internal uncertainties are often underestimated , and some of our guesses are necessarily rough , we have re - scaled them by iterations in the final solution so as to achieve reduced @xmath79 values near unity separately for each source , for all astrometric and spectroscopic data sets having a sufficient number of observations .",
    "all prior studies of capella based on data sets of sufficient size and quality have concluded that the eccentricity of the orbit is not significantly different from zero . we were therefore somewhat surprised that our initial solutions gave a very small yet statistically significant value of @xmath80 , with @xmath81 .",
    "closer examination revealed that this is driven exclusively by the high - weight @xcite observations , which when used alone give @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "a solution without the hummel measurements yields a circular orbit , as does one that uses only the cfa radial velocities , which carry the largest weight among the remaining data sets .",
    "the cfa primary velocities , when considered separately , also suggest the orbit is circular , but our secondary velocities , which have larger uncertainties , prefer @xmath84 .",
    "this result is clearly related to the residual patterns shown in figure  [ fig : cfaorb ] , seen only in the secondary , which we believe to be most likely of instrumental origin , as discussed in  [ sec : specnew ] . on the basis of this evidence we are inclined to conclude that the eccentricity we derive from the hummel et al.measurements is spurious . in their own orbital solution",

    "@xcite also provided a likely explanation for the scaling problem .",

    "this adopted wavelength sets the scale of the angular separations .",
    "they pointed out that while 5500  may be a suitable value for observations of early g - type stars like the sun , the mean temperature of capella is now known to somewhat cooler than the sun s , and therefore a slightly longer effective wavelength would be more appropriate . in their estimation",

    "the hotter star is slightly brighter , but around 7000  the ratio reverses , and the cooler , more massive star becomes dominant .",
    "this explains why some of the interferometric measurements such as those by @xcite and @xcite , which were made at red or near infrared wavelengths , have the quadrants reversed compared with measurements in the optical .",

    "detached binary systems such as capella that are composed of two giant stars and show double - lined spectra are rare , and they provide important tests of models in a relatively short - lived phase of stellar evolution .",
    "their component masses are necessarily very close to each other , and a precise measurement of the mass ratio @xmath167 , as we provide here , becomes critical to establishing their state of evolution unambiguously .    the evolutionary status of capella has been a subject of debate for decades . while there is general consensus that the hotter secondary is crossing the hertzprung gap and approaching the base of the giant branch ( rgb ) ,",
    "opinions have varied on the precise location of the primary , in large part because of uncertainties in the masses as well as the effective temperatures and luminosities used to place the star on the h - r diagram .",
    "capella is perhaps unique in that , in addition to those properties , a wealth of other information is available to aid in determining its evolutionary state , including the surface li abundances of both stars , the @xmath9c/@xmath10c isotope ratio for the primary , c / n ratios , and activity indicators in the optical , ultraviolet , and x rays .",
    "the progenitors of capella were late b- or early a - type stars .",
    "when such stars leave the main sequence , they develop convective envelopes that deepen significantly as they approach the giant branch , mixing the outer layers with matter from the interior partially processed through the cno cycle . as a result ,",
    "fragile elements such as lithium are burned deeper in the star decreasing the surface abundance of that element , and others such as @xmath10c and @xmath168n that are created at the expense of @xmath9c are brought to the surface during the `` first dredge - up '' .",
    "this causes a dramatic reduction in the @xmath9c/@xmath10c ratio and in the c / n ratio , both of which are measurable .",
    "thus , surface abundances contain potentially important information on the evolutionary state of evolved stars like capella .",
    "@xcite pioneered this approach by relying on early estimates of the lithium abundance of both components @xcite to conclude , based on his models , that the primary is a core helium - burning star .",
    "compared to an alternate location on the ascending giant branch , the `` clump '' phase also seems more likely because it is longer - lived . ]",
    "this lifetime argument seems to have weighed heavily in most of the other studies in which the measured masses , temperatures and luminosities have been compared against stellar evolution models , including the work of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite concluded based on her own li measurements , which differed from those of wallerstein , that the primary is not in such an advanced evolutionary state .",
    "similarly , @xcite found evidence in the small luminosity difference between the stars that the primary is still at the beginning of the rgb .",
    "they also argued for a much smaller difference in mass than indicated by the measurements at the time , and indeed our present determinations bring the mass ratio much closer to unity than implied by the spectroscopy of @xcite .",
    "@xcite also took the view that the primary is not yet burning helium in its core based on the high levels of chromospheric activity implied by their ultraviolet observations , although the opposite conclusion was reached by @xcite .",
    "the significantly improved parameters we have derived for capella , particularly the masses which are three times more precise than those previously available , offer an opportunity to revisit the issue of its evolutionary status . among the many publicly available stellar evolution models , we initially focused on those that allow some flexibility in setting parameters such as the composition or the age ( for isochrones ) .",
    "however , not all of these models extend past the helium flash , which is necessary to explore the more advanced core helium - burning phase for the primary , and thus we are somewhat limited in our choices .    as a starting point",

    "in addition to @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath20 , we consider also the absolute radii since they are determined independently from the temperatures and luminosities and are of comparable precision .",

    "however , given that the rotation of the primary appears to be synchronized with the orbital motion (  [ sec : tidal ] ) , one may expect tidal forces to have had some effect on that star whereas the secondary is farther from synchronization , and more likely to have evolved as an isolated star .",
    "thus we only required a match to the rotation of the secondary , and we adopted the same value of @xmath198 for the primary on the grounds that the masses are the same within 1% , so all properties including rotation must have been very similar to begin with .",

    "we note that in both models the metallicity that seems to be favored ( @xmath177 ) is actually in very good agreement with the spectroscopic value (  [ sec : abundances ] ) derived from the work of @xcite , despite our concerns about possible biases in those measurements .",
    "even if we accepted the latter as accurate , and had _ imposed _ that value on the models thereby eliminating @xmath203 as a free parameter , @xmath204 and @xmath205 are still adjustable quantities .",

    "a comparison of the results from that work for other stars that have also been measured by others seems to indicate some systematic differences , but it is difficult to tell which values are correct . for example , measurements by @xcite of the four hyades giants @xmath35  tau , @xmath217  tau , @xmath218  tau , and @xmath219  tau , which have masses only slightly smaller than capella , give @xmath9c/@xmath10c ratios of 19 , 23 , 22 , and 20 , respectively , while @xcite reported 24 , 26 , 26 , and 27 , all systematically higher .",
    "it is possible that errors in the determination of the microturbulent velocity @xmath220 can explain these differences , since @xcite and many others have shown that the @xmath9c abundances are quite sensitive to @xmath220 because the @xmath9cn lines from which they are often measured are typically close to saturation .",
    "a cursory examination of measurements for other giant stars by different authors indicates similar discrepancies , which leads us to believe the uncertainties in some of these studies may be underestimated .",
    "a new measurement of the @xmath9c/@xmath10c ratio for capella  a would be extremely helpful to settle this issue .",
    "table  [ tab : modelsy ] shows that the surface lithium abundance predicted for the secondary of capella from the tycho models is in agreement with the measurement , within the uncertainties , and is not much reduced from its main - sequence value . the primary lithium abundance , on the other hand , is larger than observed by about 3@xmath92 , regardless of the value of @xmath211 . according to these models @xmath221",
    "is not expected to dip much below 1.9 even after the phase of core helium burning , as the star evolves up the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "thus , it appears lithium burning in capella  a has been more efficient than predicted by theory during the first dredge - up , or there was additional burning afterwards . unlike the case of @xmath9c/@xmath10c , there are several independent measurements of the  @xmath466708 line for the primary , and they display rather good agreement .",
    "a possible explanation for the discrepancy is that in the current tycho models rotational and convective / wave sources of shear at the convective boundary are not correctly coupled .",
    "mixing at the base of the envelope in the models will be less than that of the real star , and this could result in discrepancies in the abundances of low - temperature burning products .    as seen from the comparisons above with three different sets of evolutionary models , we are unable to find an evolutionary state for the binary that gives complete consistency with all absolute dimensions for both stars as well as all chemical indicators , simultaneously .",
    "partial matches are possible , indicating either deficiencies in our understanding of stellar evolution , observational errors in some quantities , or both .",
    "other evidence of the evolutionary status of capella has occasionally been considered by some authors , including activity indicators in the uv and x rays .",
    "for example , based on similarities with other stars , @xcite estimated that the primary may be responsible for as much as half of the total 0.10.4 kev soft x - ray coronal emission from the system , even though it only accounts for a small fraction of the far - uv emission characteristic of the chromospheric layers .",
    "a comparison with the generally weaker coronal x - ray levels of clump giants led them to conclude that capella  a is crossing the hertzprung gap for the first time , and is yet to go through the first ascent .",
    "although this significant level of x - ray emission was subsequently confirmed by others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this picture seems inconsistent with some of the chemical indicators discussed above .",
    "additionally , clump giants are known to display a wide range of coronal emission levels ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , perhaps indicative of activity cycles analogous to that of the sun .",
    "virtually all uv and x - ray studies after the mid 1980s have implicitly _ assumed _ the primary of capella is a core - helium burning star , on the grounds that it would be very unlikely to find both components of a binary in a very rapid state of evolution such as the hertzprung gap or the first ascent , given that the secondary is already known to be a first crosser .",
    "this could only happen if the mass ratio were very near unity , and that did not appear to be the case until now .",
    "@xcite proposed the primary may be in the early stages of core - helium burning , while other giants that are even more active such as @xmath154  cet and the hyades stars @xmath35  tau and @xmath219  tau were considered to be in a more advanced clump phase ( `` blue loop '' ) .",
    "qualitative assessments of the evolutionary state based on the overall activity level remain problematic , and are not easily testable against models .",
    "we conclude this section by pointing out that the detached nature of capella , and therefore its value for testing stellar evolution theory , is beyond doubt .",
    "the size predicted for the primary at the tip of the giant branch from any of the models considered above is less than 35  @xmath222 , and would still fit comfortably inside its critical roche surface ( @xmath1160  @xmath222 ) .",
    "thus , even if the primary were already in the clump , mass transfer by roche - lobe overflow would have been avoided .",
    "capella is a particularly favorable case to study the rotational state of the components .",
    "in addition to the measures of @xmath22 and the radii , the rotational periods @xmath223 of both stars have been measured as well .",
    "@xcite found that the radial velocity of the chromospheric  @xmath4610830 absorption line follows the velocity of the photospheric lines of the primary , unambiguously identifying this activity feature with that star .",
    "the equivalent width of the line was also seen to vary with a period indistinguishable from the orbital period , which was interpreted as the rotational signature of the primary .",
    "@xcite confirmed this with additional data , and measured a rotation period of 103.97  days .",
    "they were also able to detect a weaker component of the line associated with the secondary star .",
    "the radial velocity of this feature again varied in phase with the photospheric velocities for capella  b , but its equivalent width was seen to vary with a period of 8.25 days , representing the rotation of the secondary .",
    "@xcite detected the rotational signature of both stars in their h@xmath13 photometry , with periods of @xmath224 days for the primary and @xmath225 days for the secondary .",
    "these observations make it very likely that the primary s rotation is effectively synchronized with the orbital motion , while the secondary is spinning more than 12 times more rapidly . for the purpose of this work",
    "we adopt a compromise value of @xmath226 days for capella  b.    with these periods and the measured radii , the predicted rotational velocities projected along the line of sight are @xmath227  kms@xmath19and @xmath228  kms@xmath19  for the primary and secondary , respectively , under the assumption that the spin axes are aligned with the orbital axis . these predictions may be compared directly against the measured @xmath22 values in table  [ tab : vsini ] .",
    "we note , however , that most of those determinations  including our own  have ignored the additional broadening that comes from macroturbulence",
    ". this can be significant for giants and in our case is particularly important for the primary , which is a slow rotator .",
    "the only two determinations of @xmath229 in the table that have accounted for macroturbulence @xcite are both smaller than ours , and average 4  kms@xmath19 .",
    "a giant star with the spectral type of capella  a is expected to have a macroturbulent velocity @xmath230 between 5 and 6  kms@xmath19  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the synthetic templates we used in ",
    "[ sec : specnew ] to determine @xmath231 have @xmath41  kms@xmath19 . a correction for this difference following @xcite and",
    "@xcite brings our @xmath22 value for the primary down from 6.5  kms@xmath19  to about 5.0  kms@xmath19 . for the secondary this effect",
    "hardly matters , but a similar correction assuming @xmath232  kms@xmath19  leads to @xmath233  kms@xmath19 .",
    "these are the values we adopt in the following ( table  [ tab : dimensions ] ) .",
    "the agreement with the predicted velocities , which is well within the errors , can be considered as an indication that the absolute radii based on angular diameters are accurate .",
    "the binary system of capella resembles in many respects that of the 76-day period eclipsing system tz  for @xcite , which is also composed of giants .",
    "both have a circular orbit , and one component in synchronous rotation while the other is super - synchronous .",
    "this puzzling situation is of course explained by tidal forces , which increase exponentially as the more massive primaries evolve first and expand in size .",
    "the result is a sharp drop in their rotation rates , and the damping of the orbital eccentricity .",
    "we have computed the critical times of rotational synchronization and orbital circularization for capella according to the turbulent dissipation and radiative damping mechanisms by ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , as well as the hydrodynamical mechanism of ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "note that we calculate actual _ times _ rather than time__scales _",
    "_ , since the latter would be completely meaningless for giant stars such as capella that have altered their structure drastically since the zams , changing from having radiative to convective envelopes .",
    "thus we have integrated the differential equations for the changes in the orbital eccentricity and rotation rates along the evolutionary tracks following the prescriptions of @xcite , to properly account for the stellar properties during the radiative and convective phases of evolution .",
    "the results obtained using the claret non - rotating models for capella a and b for @xmath177 , @xmath201 , and @xmath186 ( case  a ) are illustrated in figure  [ fig : tidal ] . in this diagram",
    "the radii are plotted as a function of age , and the times of synchronization and circularization are indicated along with the evolutionary age of the system ( @xmath234  myr ) . for the primary",
    "the theory of @xcite gives @xmath235  myr , and for the secondary @xmath236  myr , both of which agree with the observation that the primary already appears to have its rotation synchronized with the orbital motion while the secondary is clearly asynchronous . according to these models",
    "the spin of each star becomes locked with the orbital motion when the components reach their maximum size at the tip of the giant branch ( figure  [ fig : tidal ] , top ) .",
    "circularization occurs somewhat later , at @xmath237  myr . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is larger than the age of the binary and the prediction is thus formally inconsistent with the apparent circularity of the orbit , although perhaps not by much considering the approximations in tidal theory .",
    "similar calculations for the mechanism of @xcite are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : tidal ] , and indicate formal consistency with the observations for all three critical times .",
    "-0.1 in -0.45 in 0.5 in    we have repeated the calculations according to both tidal theories for the other scenarios considered earlier based on the claret models , and the agreement with the observations varies . the results are summarized in table  [ tab : tidal ] . with one exception ( case  a and the mechanism of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in no other scenario are all three critical times strictly consistent with reality , but the predictions are so close to the best - fit evolutionary ages that the results are very sensitive to the details of the models and the calculations .",
    "for example , the mere addition of rotation to the first set of evolutionary tracks examined above is enough to change the conclusions entirely regarding tidal theory , even though it hardly changes the stellar properties for the best fit .",
    "thus , it is not possible to establish which tidal theory is more appropriate for capella .",
    "we note , in this connection , that the theory of tassoul has often been found to be too efficient , at least for main - sequence stars , giving critical times that are occasionally 12 orders of magnitude shorter than those by zahn . in capella that is not the case . given that the critical times from these two theories tend toward each other in the limit of long periods , this again",
    "is an indication that tidal forces in this binary are relatively weak .",
    "another consequence of tidal forces in binaries is that the spin axes of the stars tend towards alignment with the orbital axis . because the timescale for this is typically much shorter than for the other two effects , at least for main - sequence stars , it is almost universally assumed that the axes in binary systems are aligned .",
    "the simplifying advantage is that one can then set the inclination of the rotation axes equal to the orbital inclination , as we ourselves have done above , for example to infer equatorial rotational velocities .",
    "we note however , that this assumption may not always hold ( see , e.g. , the case of @xmath46  vir ; * ? ? ?",
    "the timescale for alignment depends strongly on the ratio between the orbital and rotational angular momenta .",
    "this ratio is large for capella because of the long orbital period , so the timescales for alignment are close to those for synchronization . as an example of such calculations , we use the rotating claret models with @xmath177 , @xmath201 , and @xmath186 ( case  e ) , and find that the alignment times according to @xcite are 555.9  myr for the primary and 563.6  myr for the secondary . these are again so near the evolutionary age of 558  myr for this scenario that it is difficult to draw general conclusions . at face value",
    "the primary is formally predicted to have reached alignment , while the secondary is still a few myr from reaching it .",
    "the critical times for alignment according to @xcite are 562.3  myr and 570.2  myr , both of which are formally greater than the age , implying that the spin axes are not necessarily aligned . in capella there is an observational constraint on this prediction , given by the rotation periods , @xmath22 values , and absolute radii determined for the two components .",
    "as indicated earlier in this section , there is very good agreement ( particularly for the more discriminating secondary ) between the measured @xmath22 values and the predicted rotational velocities , when the latter are projected along the line of sight using the well - known orbital inclination angle .",
    "this is evidence that the orbital axes are in fact closely aligned with the orbit , and we conclude that tidal theory does not clearly agree with the observations in this instance .",
    "with our new spectroscopic observations of capella and a global orbital solution that uses all available astrometric and radial - velocity measurements , the precision of the most important of the physical properties of the stars  their masses  has been improved threefold compared to previous values , and now stands at 0.7% for the primary and 0.5% for the secondary .",
    "these are at the level of the best available determinations from double - lined eclipsing binaries ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as others have pointed out , the mass _ ratio _ is perhaps more important in this case since it sets constraints on the differential evolution of the stars ; that quantity is now known to even higher precision ( 0.36% ) .",
    "based on the tests and crosschecks documented in this paper , it is our belief that the _ accuracy _ has also improved significantly .",
    "our dynamical masses differ from earlier results by 9% and 5% , respectively , which has an enormous impact on the evolutionary state of giants such as these .",
    "our goal here has been to bring to bear all relevant information on the physical properties of capella for a comprehensive discussion of the system in terms of its evolution .",
    "in addition to the masses , we report significantly improved determinations of the absolute radii , the effective temperatures , the luminosities , the rotational state of the stars , and the chemical composition , including the overall [ m / h ] index , the lithium abundance , and the @xmath9c/@xmath10c and c / n ratios . we know of no other evolved system with so much high - quality information available .",
    "sanity checks have been performed , whenever possible , to assess the accuracy of these quantities .",
    "our expectation at the outset was then that we should be able to pinpoint the evolutionary state of these giants , particularly the primary , and validate current models of stellar evolution that seem to work so well on the main sequence .",
    "instead , we find that there are now so many constraints that no single model is able to satisfy them all simultaneously , _ even when adjusting some of the free parameters in theory_.    three types of stellar evolution models have been considered , two based on standard convection prescriptions @xcite and one with an alternative formulation ( tycho evolution code ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have also explored the role of rotation . in most cases it is possible to obtain reasonably good matches to @xmath172 , @xmath155 , @xmath173 , and @xmath20 for both components at a variety of evolutionary states for the primary ,",
    "of which the clump does not particularly provide one of the best matches .",
    "this is in contrast with most previous studies , which overwhelmingly place the primary in the core - helium burning phase , and is largely due to the fact that the mass ratio is now much closer to unity than previously believed ( within 1% , versus 5% previously ) .",
    "this allows the `` evolutionary gap '' between the components to narrow considerably .",
    "these four properties alone are therefore insufficient to discriminate between different models or different states for capella  a.    chemical constraints are seen to be particularly powerful in this case .",
    "we find that the overall metallicity [ m / h ] required for the models to match the properties of the two stars is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic determination .",
    "however , the predicted @xmath9c/@xmath10c values for the primary are systematically too low ( at the @xmath112@xmath92 confidence level ) , if the measurement is to be taken at face value , and would require that component to be near the base of the rgb .",
    "this is inconsistent with the well - determined temperature and luminosity ( or radius ) .",
    "errors in the rather delicate measurement of the carbon isotope ratio can not be ruled out , and a new determination would be highly beneficial .",
    "similarly , models tend to overestimate the apparently well - measured lithium abundance of the primary ( discrepancies at the @xmath113@xmath92 level ) , although they do match that of the secondary , which is essentially the initial value .",
    "the observed c / n ratios only permit the primary star to be on the descending branch prior to the helium - burning phase , or at the clump . ascending branch scenarios are ruled out at the many-@xmath92 level",
    ". a location on the descending branch would in fact be more likely than on the first ascent , given that the descent takes about 3 times longer ( see footnote  [ foot : times ] ) .",
    "it may well be that the primary is indeed a clump giant , but the fact remains that current stellar evolution models fail to satisfy all of the observational constraints when considered jointly , for both components at the same time , and at a single age , whether the primary is in the core - helium burning phase or at any other location .",
    "predictions are still very strongly dependent on the physics in the models , underscoring our incomplete understanding of many of these processes .",
    "the @xmath9c/@xmath10c measurement suggests that convective mixing in the primary is less efficient than predicted , while the lithium determination appears to shows the opposite .",
    "it is also quite possible that the masses , as precise as they already are , need to be improved further by an order of magnitude given the sensitivity of the predictions .",
    "if that is the case , then both better spectroscopy and better astrometry will be required , since the latter contributes a non - negligible @xmath110.3% to the present mass errors .",
    "tidal theory does not seem to fare much better .",
    "the circular orbit of capella along with the evidence for synchronous rotation of the primary and asynchronous rotation of the secondary pose strong constraints that are in general not quite met by the mechanisms of @xcite and @xcite . similarly with the alignment of the rotational axes with the orbital axis , which is observationally constrained by the measurements of @xmath155 , @xmath22 , and @xmath223 . to be fair , however",
    ", the critical ages for circularization , synchronization , and alignment inferred from these models for the various scenarios considered are typically close to the evolutionary age in each case , so the results may be sensitive to the details of the calculations and are not conclusive .    despite these challenges ,",

    "the relatively long orbital period of capella from the spectroscopic studies of @xcite and @xcite immediately suggested to investigators from the beginning of the 20th century the possibility that it might be detected as a visual binary , with a separation somewhat under 01 , according to the best estimates at the time . foreseeing the potential of interferometry ,",

    "@xcite used the same telescope to look at capella on multiple occasions , but also reported the images to be essentially round .    at about the same time , visual binary observers at the greenwich observatory took an interest as well , and reported seeing the image elongated with the 28-inch refractor ( resolving power @xmath11019 ) on 1900 april 4 .",

    "the most remarkable fact about the greenwich observations , as discussed by @xcite , is their overall agreement with the astrometric orbit of @xcite , which was not published until _ twenty years later_. merrill himself had compared the greenwich measurements with his orbit , but other than noting some relatively minor discrepancies , he made no judgement about them .",
    "@xcite had also discussed these measurements in connection with his own spectroscopic observations , but this was also long before the astrometric orbit was known . aside from these two studies , the greenwich observations appear to have been largely ignored .",
    "the refined orbital solution derived in the present work enables us to examine the accuracy of these measurements more closely .",
    "the circumstances of each observation were reconstructed based on published information .",
    "most of the position angle estimates were made during the daytime , some at night , and a few during twilight , and all of them at hour angles greater than about 2 hours ( east or west ) because of pointing limitations .",
    "a group of observations from 1900 april 23 to may 11 were considered by @xcite to be influenced by color effects , and we have not considered them here .",
    "the first peculiar coincidence is that the observers correctly recorded the position angle of capella to be decreasing with time ( retrograde motion on the sky ) , which , as noted by @xcite , they could not have known in 1900 since the only information available to them was that provided by the spectroscopic orbit .",
    "secondly , the observations correctly placed the ascending node in the first quadrant as opposed to the third .",
    "given the knowledge of the spectroscopic orbit , this can only be determined unambiguously from visual observations and if a difference in brightness is detected , which the greenwich observers apparently saw , as reported by @xcite .",
    "we now know that this difference is quite small in the visible , and as pointed out earlier , observers many decades later were still struggling with the difficulty of quadrant determination ( see  [ sec : lightratio ] ) . furthermore , the actual position angle of the node implied by these observations is very roughly the correct value .",
    "the modern determination gives @xmath238 , and the estimate reported by @xcite after the first year of observation is @xmath239 .",
    "however , this value may be influenced by the fact that the greenwich observers allowed the orbit to be eccentric , and in fact obtained a small but apparently significant value of @xmath240 , whereas we now know the orbit is essentially circular ( see  [ sec : orbit ] ) . repeating the calculation for a circular orbit , and holding the period and epoch of nodal passage fixed at their known values , we obtain a revised estimate of @xmath241 from the full sample of original greenwich measurements , which is even closer to the modern value . finally , the orbital inclination angle from this revised solution is @xmath242 , also not far from the correct value of @xmath243 .    in figure",

    "-1.1 in -0.18 in -2.1 in    the agreements described above with the modern orbit of capella are most intriguing . while it is certainly true that these measurements were made pushing the limits of what is possible for the visual technique , and that some of the most experienced observers of the time failed repeatedly to see any convincing elongation in the star s image even using larger telescopes , the greenwich observations are not easily dismissed .",
    "@xcite suspected that some of the measurements could have resulted  consciously or subconsciously  from foreknowledge of what the motion of capella should be , based on the spectroscopic orbit that had just been published .",
    "the observers would certainly have known the average daily rate of change of the position angle , but nothing about variations in that rate throughout the orbit due to the inclination angle , or the direction of motion , and most certainly they could not have known in which quadrant the ascending node would be .",

    "we note , for example , that the quadrants of the individual observations as published are all consistent with the modern orbit , with the exception of two that need to be reversed . rather than implying that the observers were able to determine the correct orientation in every case by detecting the slight difference in brightness",

    "there is a significant body of literature on x - ray observations of capella , which is not surprising given that it is the brightest steady coronal source in the x - ray sky .",
    "the available abundance determinations made from coronal emission - line fluxes have been collected in table  [ tab : coronal ] , and have been adjusted to conform to the standard solar abundances by @xcite , for consistency with the photospheric determinations ( see  [ sec : abundances ] ) .",
    "coronal abundances in the sun are known to depend on the first ionization potential ( fip ) , although the large - scale element fractionation processes presumably involved are not completely understood .",
    "elements having low fip ( @xmath260 ev ) are overabundant compared to those with high fip ( @xmath261 ev ) .",
    "we indicate the fip values in table  [ tab : coronal ] , along with the average abundance for each element in the last column . the fip trend has also been seen in some active stars , while others appear to show the opposite effect . for capella",
    "there has been some debate about this issue , some authors claiming a mild fip effect @xcite , or even an inverse effect @xcite , and others claiming no effect at all @xcite .",
    "some of this disagreement may stem from the use of different solar abundances , which is why we have homogenized all measurements here . as indicated in  [ sec : abundances ] , most authors agree that nitrogen is overabundant . the average abundance of the remaining high - fip elements ( c , o , ar , ne ) is @xmath262 , while that of the low - fip elements ( ca , ni , mg , fe , si ) is @xmath263 , although it is likely that the true uncertainty is larger than indicated by these statistical errors .",
    "sulfur has been excluded since its first ionization potential is close to the conventional dividing line of 10  ev .",
    "the fip effect is thus clear in capella : low - fip elements are enhanced by a factor of @xmath112 relative to high - fip elements ( see figure  [ fig : coronal ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the evidence in the sun indicates that high - fip elements show better average agreement with the photospheric composition ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if the same were true in capella , then the coronal abundance as measured from the high - fip elements supports the photospheric determination of @xcite , which gives an overall metallicity of [ m / h ] @xmath264 . under the same assumption ,",
    "the enhancement of n relative to the high - fip ( or photospheric ) composition would also be about a factor of 2 , or slightly higher .",
    "considering that this measure is diluted to some degree by the flux contribution from the ( presumably normal composition ) secondary , it appears to agree at least qualitatively with model predictions by @xcite , which indicate a n enhancement of a factor of @xmath113.1 for a post first dredge - up star .",
    "the average c / n ratio from table  [ tab : coronal ] ( note that since both c and n have high fip , any residual fip effect is more likely to cancel out ) is approximately 0.52 , though with a large uncertainty of at least 0.20.3 due to the scatter in c. an independent and perhaps more accurate estimate was reported by @xcite as c / n @xmath265 .",
    "the ratios predicted by the @xcite models are 0.67 after first dredge - up and 3.27 for the unevolved secondary , again roughly consistent with the measured values for the combined flux .",
    "other models considered in  [ sec : evolution ] give similar values .",
    "although a somewhat clearer and consistent picture than one might glean from a casual look at the literature seems to emerge from the above regarding coronal abundances in capella , uncertainties are still rather large and our understanding of heating and element separation in the outer layers of stellar atmospheres is still limited .",

    "<S> our highly accurate three - dimensional orbital solution based on all existing spectroscopic and astrometric observations including our own yields much improved masses for the primary and secondary of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with relative errors of only 0.7% and 0.5% , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the mass ratio is considerably closer to unity than previously believed , which has an impact on assessing the evolutionary state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> improved values are presented also for the radii ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , effective temperatures ( @xmath4  k and @xmath5  k ) , and luminosities ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) . the distance is determined to be @xmath8  pc , based on the accurate orbital parallax . the projected rotational velocities and individual rotation periods are also known . </S>",
    "<S> capella is unique among evolved stars in that , in addition to all of the above , the chemical composition is known as well . </S>",
    "<S> this includes the overall metallicity [ m / h ] , the carbon isotope ratio @xmath9c/@xmath10c for the primary , and the lithium abundance and c / n ratios for both components . </S>",
    "<S> we present new or revised values for some of these . </S>",
    "<S> the latter three quantities are sensitive diagnostics of evolution , and change drastically for giants as a result of the deepening of the convective envelope during the first dredge - up . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary is crossing the hertzprung gap , while the primary is believed to be in the longer - lived core - helium burning phase . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies using only the masses , temperatures , and luminosities have found good agreement with stellar evolution models placing the primary in the clump . </S>",
    "<S> here we compare all of the constraints simultaneously against three sets of current models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that they are unable to match all of the observations for both components at the same time , and at a single age , for any evolutionary state of the primary . </S>",
    "<S> this shows the great importance of chemical information for assessing the evolutionary state of giant stars . a comparison with models of tidal evolution yields similarly disappointing results , when tested against the fact that the orbit is circular , the primary is rotating synchronously , the secondary @xmath1112 times faster than synchronous , and the spin axes are apparently aligned with the axis of the orbit . </S>",
    "<S> when confronted in detail , our understanding of the advanced stages of stellar evolution is thus still very incomplete . </S>"
