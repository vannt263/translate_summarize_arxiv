    "single electron tunneling ( set ) devices have attracted much attention during the recent years . they can be used to manipulate electrons one by one , and it is the hope that they can be applied as e.g. memory cells or as fundamental current standards . however , there are still a number of unanswered questions regarding the limitations of single electron devices .",
    "one such limitation is the so - called cotunneling process where an electron charge tunnels through the devices thus giving rise to a leakage current .",
    "this process has been studied extensively both theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite experiments have confirmed the theory of averin and nazarov,@xcite who derived the cotunneling current for a double junction system at small bias and low temperatures.@xcite it has been argued within the present understanding of these devices that extremely high accuracy could be achieved leading to metrological applications.@xcite however theory and experiments differ by several orders of magnitude.@xcite at present it not clear what the source of this discrepancy is .",
    "the intrinsic noise properties of the materials due to charge fluctuations@xcite is one possible source , but the quantum mechanics of the dynamically driven system is also an issue which should be considered in order to understand the fundamental limits .",
    "therefore an important aspect of single electron devices is their dynamical property and their response to an applied high frequency signal .",
    "so far theoretical works on single electron circuits@xcite have used an adiabatic approximation where it is assumed that the static cotunneling rate can be used at every time step . at first sight",
    "this approximation seems justified when the applied frequency is much lower than @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electrostatic energy required to add or remove an electron .",
    "as we shall show , this is however not so obvious because activated cotunneling is not exponentially suppressed but increases as a power law of applied energy .",
    "the power law is a consequence of the fact that it is phase - space that limits the cotunneling process .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the importance of the photon assisted cotunneling induced by time dependent bias and gate voltages in the case of a double junction system in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "note that this is different from cases previously discussed in the literature@xcite where the assisting photons are supposed to be supplied from an incoherent source , namely the electromagnetic environment connected to a heat bath .",
    "the coherent - photon - assisted cotunneling is shown to yield an important and in fact for certain parameters the dominant contribution to the current .",
    "we develop a non - perturbative formalism that combines cotunneling and sequential tunneling and thus generalizes previous works which dealt with the static case.@xcite however , our approach is restricted to the weak coupling limit and does not include renormalization effects.@xcite in the low frequency limit , we separate the photon assisted cotunneling in two contributions , one corresponding to an adiabatic approximation and one corresponding to higher order processes . in particular , we derive a perturbative result for the case of zero dc bias , which we refer to as a cotunneling electron pump .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the double junction model .",
    "the tunnel current is derived in section [ sec : scat ] using scattering theory and several limits are considered : weak tunneling , sequential tunneling , the adiabatic limit and the case of small voltage and low temperature where a perturbation expansion is applicable . in section [ sec",
    ": num ] numerical results are given and , finally , conclusions are in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "technical details of the time dependent scattering theory are in an appendix .",
    "we use the standard tunneling model for transport through a double barrier system with coulomb interactions represented by the electrostatic energies .",
    "the model hamiltonian reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 represent the free electron parts in the left lead , in the right lead , and in the dot , respectively .",
    "the charging energy is included in @xmath7 and it is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the charging energy , @xmath10 is set by the gate voltages and @xmath11 is the number of electrons in the dot . in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) @xmath12 is the tunneling hamiltonian with tunneling matrix element @xmath13 connecting the dot to the left(right ) lead .",
    "the time dependent parts are contained in @xmath14 and we consider the case where the potentials of the leads and the dot ( by the gate voltage ) are modulated in time @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number operator in section @xmath17 .    by a standard unitary transformation ( using @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 we may transform the hamiltonian into @xmath20 , whereby the time dependence is now present in the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath21 here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are operators in the leads and in the dot , respectively , and @xmath24 \\right).\\ ] ] without loss of generality we simplify the following discussion by transferring any non - zero dc part from the time dependent potential to the static bias or gate voltages . consequently , if @xmath25 is periodic so is @xmath26 and with the same period .",
    "in order to calculate the cotunneling rates we generalize the standard time independent scattering theory and obtain an expression for the average transition rate @xmath27 between an initial and a final state ( both eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian ) under the influence of a time dependent perturbation ( here @xmath28 ) .",
    "the @xmath29-matrix expansion then forms the basis for a non - perturbative expression for the current in the limit of small tunneling matrix elements .",
    "this approach thus generalizes previous scattering theory formulations@xcite to finite frequency and finite temperature .",
    "we furthermore utilize a breit - wigner - type approximation which does not include renormalization effects in the strong tunneling regime.@xcite    the result for the transition rate is derived in appendix [ app : scat ] . after time averaging it reads @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the period of the potentials . here",

    "we assume that the coherence between the individual tunnelings can be neglected , which means that the tunneling uncertainty time @xmath49 , is much smaller than @xmath50 . in this case",
    ", the current can be obtained from the transition rate between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath52 is thermally distributed , but with a fixed number of electrons on the island .",
    "the lifetimes of the intermediate states are given by the imaginary part of @xmath53 .",
    "the real part is neglected since it only gives a small shift of the electrostatic energy .",
    "the lifetime obtained from eq.([sigmaappr ] ) equals the half of the fermi s golden rule transition rate for tunneling out of the intermediate state . in the present paper , we restrict ourselves to a two state approximation ( denoted by @xmath54 ) and therefore the lifetime is given by the transition rate from the intermediate state to the initial state .    by summing over all possible intermediate states while assuming the electronic occupation in the initial state to be in thermal equilibrium we finally obtain for tunneling rate in the positive direction @xmath55 where @xmath56 and where @xmath57 is the probability that the system initially was in the state with @xmath58 .",
    "we must include this factor since our derivation for the current assumes that the initial state corresponds to the minimum electrostatic energy .",
    "above , we have introduced a function @xmath59 , which describes the propagation of the intermediate states .",
    "it is defined by @xmath60 here the first term corresponds to an electron first tunneling through the left junction followed by an electron tunneling out of the right junction , while the second term comes from the reverse process . in eq .",

    "these rates are well - known from previous works on photon assisted tunneling in coulomb blockade systems.@xcite @xmath66 is the tunneling rate without the ac field given in eq.([gamma ] ) .",
    "the reverse rate is obtained by interchanging left and right .",
    "we assume that the bias is such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( any asymmetry can be absorbed into the voltage on the island gate ) .",
