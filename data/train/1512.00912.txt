    "research triggered by the experimental discovery of quasicrystals , see  @xcite for a recent mathematical monograph , provided examples of non - periodic structures with long - range order .",
    "their diffraction spectrum consists of bragg peaks only .",
    "a mathematical abstraction of these examples are so - called regular model sets , which are certain projections of a subset of a higher - dimensional lattice .",
    "in fact , model sets have been introduced and intensively studied before the discovery of quasicrystals by meyer @xcite , and they have later been re - investigated and advocated by moody , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a central result in mathematical diffraction theory states that regular model sets have a pure point diffraction spectrum .",
    "the particular form of their bragg peaks has been proved in the euclidean setting by hof @xcite , using the underlying lattice poisson summation formula ( psf ) . when it became clear that examples with a non - euclidean embedding space exist , such as limit - periodic model sets @xcite ,",
    "their diffraction has been studied in general @xmath0-compact locally compact abelian ( lca ) groups . only then pure point diffractivity had been fully established .",
    "however the corresponding proofs did not rely on the psf , but instead used dynamical systems , see e.g.  schlottmann @xcite for so - called repetitive regular model sets , and @xcite for recent results in that direction . on the other hand ,",

    "yet another approach to pure point diffractivity uses almost periodic measures , see e.g.  solomyak @xcite , baake ",
    "moody @xcite and the recent work @xcite .",
    "these results have also been extended to weighted dirac combs with weight functions on the embedding space of sufficiently fast decay , which are called admissible in @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we will reprove the diffraction formula for regular model sets on general @xmath0-compact lca groups using the psf of the underlying lattice . working beyond euclidean space",
    ", we can not follow the tempered distribution approach as in @xcite , but rely instead on fourier theory of unbounded measures , as in argabright and de lamadrid  @xcite . whereas working with measures only seems a severe restriction ,",
    "this is in fact natural , as diffraction may be described by a measure .",
    "indeed , the diffraction measure of the infinite idealisation of a finite specimen decomposes into a pure point and a continuous part , which correspond to the bragg peaks and to the continuous component in the diffraction picture .",
    "we will extend elements of hof s proof to the non - euclidean setting .",
    "a crucial ingredient in hof s approach ( and in all later approaches to pure point diffractivity ) is a certain uniform distribution result for regular model sets .",
    "proofs of uniform distribution in the general setting are based on geometric @xcite or dynamical systems arguments @xcite .",
    "we will show that uniform distribution actually follows from the underlying lattice psf . in the euclidean",

    "this insight allows us to show that the lattice psf and the diffraction formula for regular model sets can be derived from one another .",
    "thus our proofs shed also some new light on the euclidean case .",
    "they justify an opinion sometimes expressed by experimentalists , that diffraction properties of quasicrystals should be deducible from those of the underlying lattice .",
    "indeed , the uniform distribution result can be seen as a consequence of the lattice psf .",
    "in fact , the diffraction formula of the underlying lattice is equivalent to the diffraction formula for regular model sets in this setting .",
    "our approach also indicates that problems equivalent to the psf , such as function reconstruction via sampling @xcite , may also be successfully analysed for model sets in the abstract setting .",
    "it further suggests a method for extending cut - and - project schemes beyond the abelian case , which might provide an alternative to the recent approach in @xcite .",
    "we remark that , for our main results , the essential property of the underlying lattice is fourier transformability , not the lattice property itself .",
    "indeed our approach can be extended to a large class of underlying fourier transformable measures @xcite .",
    "let us describe the structure of this article .",
    "after reviewing mathematical diffraction theory , we recall the fourier analysis of unbounded measures in section  [ prel ] . here",
    "we are particularly interested in generalised psf for measures , which extend the lattice case , and in double transformability . in section  [ sec : fapm ] we consider weighted model sets and discuss their fourier analysis .",
    "we prove that , for certain weight functions , their generalized psf is equivalent to the psf of the underlying lattice , and we show uniform distribution using the lattice psf . in section  [ sec : pcp ] , we will use the so - called autocorrelation measure to study the diffraction of regular model sets .",
    "we show that the diffraction formula for regular model sets can be obtained by combining the generalised psf and the density formula .",
    "thus the diffraction formula can be obtained by a double application of the psf for the underlying lattice .",
    "we also show that the lattice psf follows from the diffraction formula for regular model sets .",
    "we close with some remarks on pure point diffraction for non - regular model sets and meyer sets , and by proving double transformability of translation bounded transformable measures with meyer set support .",

    "more generally , if @xmath15 is not fourier transformable as a measure , it is still possible to analyse diffraction from a measure theoretic viewpoint if an autocorrelation @xmath27 of @xmath15 exists .",
    "this will be true in all examples below .",
    "in that situation , @xmath27 will be transformable due to positive definiteness , and its fourier transform @xmath34 will be a positive measure .",

    "our validation of the integrability condition in theorem  [ double ] relies on the lattice psf : we embed the meyer set into a regular model set coming from a cut - and - project scheme @xmath242 , and then the integrability condition follows from the psf applied to the dual lattice @xmath400 .",
    "we complete the paper by looking in the next two subsections to some recent results about weak model sets and meyer sets , and their connection to the psf . in this subsection",

    "on the other hand @xmath485 by lemma [ lm1 ] , which means that the measure @xmath464 is transformable by theorem  [ theo : main ] . thus the question arises which weighted model sets @xmath279 have an autocorrelation given by @xmath486 . as argued by moody @xcite , this property is typical when one considers the ensemble of weak model sets with all shifts of a given window together with the uniform measure on this ensemble ( * ? ? ?",

    "assume that there exists a van hove sequence @xmath190 in @xmath36 such that @xmath279 has maximal density with respect to @xmath208 , i.e. , @xmath487 then , with respect to the given van hove sequence @xmath208 , the weak model set @xmath279 has autocorrelation @xmath27 and diffraction @xmath34 given by @xmath488 where @xmath489 .",
    "in particular , @xmath279 has pure point diffraction .",
    "the proof of the equality @xmath490 in @xcite is done by a computation which is similar in idea but more technical than the proof of theorem  [ thm : ac ] .",

    "for example one may take a window with empty interior and consider a shift of the window which has empty intersection with the projected lattice .",
    "the existence of such a shift is seen by a baire argument , compare e.g.  @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "this will result in an empty weak model set , which is pure point diffractive .",

    "hence the formula for the pure point part of the diffraction of an arbitrary meyer set @xmath13 is a consequence of the psf for some cut - and - project scheme in which @xmath13 is a subset of a model set .",
