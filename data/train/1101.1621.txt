    "quantum heisenberg models and their extensions are prime examples of simple toy models that provide realistic descriptions of complicated emergent phenomena in interacting many - particle systems . under most circumstances ,",
    "these models describe systems that order magnetically at low temperatures , in general agreement with the experimental situation . there has been much interest , however , in mechanisms leading to ground states that remain magnetically disordered even at the lowest temperatures .",
    "various scenarios exist for such a possibility , where we focus on the important special case of systems with spin-@xmath0 degrees of freedom on a lattice . in a valence bond crystal",
    ", the ground state is adiabatically connected to one where lattice spins are paired up into singlets , or `` valence bonds '' .",
    "depending on the lattice , this may be possible with or without@xcite the breaking of a spatial symmetry .",
    "other variants of singlet `` crystal '' phases feature `` singlet plaquettes '' instead of individual valence bonds .",
    "even more interesting , however , is the case where adiabatic continuity to a trivial product state does not exist , and the zero temperature spin state is devoid of any crystalline character but forms a `` spin liquid '' driven by fluctuations of valence bonds .",
    "this possibility was first considered by anderson in 1973,@xcite and was coined a `` resonating valence bond '' ( rvb ) spin liquid .",
    "interest in rvb spin liquid physics has been driven both by its proposed connection@xcite to high @xmath1 superconductivity , and by the innate exotic character of rvb states , which feature fractionalized spin-@xmath0 excitations .",
    "promising experimental candidates have been identified only recently.@xcite theoretical challenges in establishing the existence of rvb spin liquids have been profound , due to the strongly interacting nature in particular of @xmath2-invariant quantum spin systems . to render the problem tractable , rokhsar and kivelson invented an ingenious scheme to explore the non - magnetic part of the phase diagram of quantum spin-@xmath0 systems through effective `` quantum dimer '' models ( qdms).@xcite they focused on the case where a gap in the system renders all correlations short ranged . in this case , the rvb spin liquid ground state can be thought of as superposition of states where spins pair up into short range valence bonds .",
    "a quantum dimer model is obtained by first truncating the hilbert space to include only states where each spin participates in a nearest neighbor valence bond ( nnvb ) . the second simplification , perhaps even bolder and more difficult to control , is to regard the nnvb states that generate the hilbert space as an _ orthogonal _ basis .",
    "in reality , no two nnvb states on a finite lattice are orthogonal .",
    "it is thus more appropriate to think of the degrees of freedom of these new effective theories not as valence bonds , but as hardcore bosons or `` dimers '' living on the links of the original lattice . as sets , however , both the hard core dimer states and the nnvb states are in one - to - one correspondence with dimerizations of the lattice into nearest neighbor pairs ,",
    "[ dimers ] .     , width=136 ]",
    "the exploration of qdms has given rise to profound insights into possible realizations of short range rvb spin liquid physics , in particular on non - bipartite lattices.@xcite it has remained challenging , however , to rigorously establish the status of simple qdms as viable effective theories for quantum spin-@xmath0 systems within a certain parameter regime .",
    "the lack of orthogonality of the nnvb states that qdms seek to describe makes it difficult to establish a direct mapping between qdms and the low energy sector of quantum spin-@xmath0 models .",
    "this difficulty can be dealt with by treating the non - orthogonality as a `` small parameter '' , and setting up a systematic expansion in this parameter .",
    "this notion already played a central role in the original literature,@xcite and was recently explored in great detail in a series of insightful papers.@xcite within this scheme , one can thus get the issue of the non - orthogonality of the nnvb states under control .",
    "however , the validity of this perturbative scheme depends crucially on the fact that the nnvb states , while not orthogonal , are at least linearly independent , like their counterparts in qdms . in technical terms , the overlap matrix obtained from the nnvb states must be invertible .",
    "the need for an invertible overlap matrix was noticed early on,@xcite and from thereon linear independence of nnvb states was routinely quoted as an assumption in the literature , e.g. in estimates of the low temperature entropy of highly frustrated quantum magnets.@xcite furthermore , exactly solvable , @xmath2-invariant spin-@xmath0 models with rvb and/or spin liquid ground states on simple lattices have only been constructed quite recently,@xcite in addition to work on decorated lattices.@xcite in ref . , rigorous ( albeit partial ) statements on the uniqueness of the rvb - type ground states of the model constructed there were intimately tied to the linear independence of nnvb states on the kagome lattice .",
    "we also note that from a purist point of view , there is a need to demonstrate that superpositions of nnvb wave functions , which may be considered as variational@xcite or exact@xcite solutions to various problems , do not vanish identically , whenever the overlaps between the nnvb states forming these wave functions do not have a uniform sign .",
    "the normalizability of such wave functions is an obvious byproduct of the linear independence of nnvb states ( on the respective lattice ) .",
    "the explicit or implicit assumption of the linear independence of the nnvb states is thus a prevalent theme in the literature on short range rvb physics , and in some cases has been studied extensively on finite clusters.@xcite    rigorous proofs of this linear independence have been available since 1989 , through a seminal work of chayes , chayes , and kivelson.@xcite the proof , however , has been limited to three different types of planar lattices , the square , honeycomb , and square - octagon lattice , and only for the case of open boundary conditions . here",
    "we discuss a more general method , that can , in principle , be applied to any lattice , in the presence of both open and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "while we usually have born  von karman periodic boundary conditions in mind which give a rectangular ( or parallelogram ) lattice strip the topology of a torus , our method applies to other lattice topologies as well . to demonstrate this",
    ", we also apply our method to the c@xmath3 lattice and other fulleren - type lattices , where the linear independence of nnvb ( or `` kekul '' ) states has direct applications in chemistry.@xcite    although there is no guarantee that our proof strategy works for every lattice where the linear independence holds , we demonstrate its applicability to many new two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices , for which the linear independence of nnvb states is first established in this work . at the same time",
    ", we generalize the aforementioned previous results on linear independence of nnvb states to the case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is well known that the physics of short range rvb states becomes enriched in subtle ways when periodic boundary conditions are imposed . on a toroidal square lattice ,",
    "e.g. , nnvb states come in a large number of topological sectors characterized by two integer winding numbers @xmath4 .",
    "( for a review , see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "when the same lattice is viewed as a rectangle with open boundary conditions , the remaining allowed nnvb state all belong to a _ subset _ of just the @xmath5 sectors . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the number of nnvb states for open boundary conditions thus becomes a vanishing fraction of the corresponding number for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is thus clear that the statement of linear independence becomes considerably stronger for periodic boundary conditions , and is often desirable in applications .",
    "we proceed by applying and refining a method that has recently been developed for the kagome lattice,@xcite making it amenable to more general lattice structures . in section [ derivation ]",
    "we review this method . in section [ lattices ] we report that this method can be applied without much alteration to the honeycomb lattice , the star lattice , the square - octagon lattice , the squagome lattice , two types of pentagonal lattices ( studied in a magnetic context , e.g. , in refs . and ) , three types of `` martini '' lattices,@xcite and two types of archimedean lattices . in section [ c60 ] , we apply the same method to fulleren - type lattices .",
    "we find that the case of the square lattice requires a generalization of this method , which is introduced and applied in section [ squarelattice ] . in section [ summary ] we summarize our results and discuss possible further applications .",
    "in this section we review the method used in ref . to prove the linear independence of the nearest neighbor valence bond states on the kagome lattice . we find that this method can be extended straightforwardly to most other lattices to be considered here .",
    "a refinement necessary to study the case of the square lattice will be given further below .",
    "the general starting point of this method is the identification of a suitable ( ideally , smallest ) cell for which a rather strong local linear independence property holds true .",
    "this local linear independence property can conveniently be verified numerically , although in many cases an analytic proof seems feasible as well . as shown in ref .",
    ", this local property then implies the linear independence of nearest neighbor valence bond states on arbitrarily large lattices that can , in a certain sense , be covered by such cells.@xcite to make this paper self - contained , we will repeat the proof in the following . for the kagome lattice ,",
    "the smallest possible cell that satisfies these requirements is the 19-site `` double star '' shown in fig .",
    "( [ kagome ] ) .     ,",
    "width=302 ]    for any given cell of a lattice , we define as interior or inner sites of the cell those sites for which all nearest neighbors are also contained within the cell . here ,",
    "the nearest neighbors of a site are all sites connected to it through a link of the lattice .",
    "sites that are not interior are called the boundary sites of the cell . for the kagome cell depicted in fig .",
    "( [ kagome ] ) , all sites belonging to one of the internal hexagons are interior , while the remaining ones are boundary sites , unless the cell happens to be at a boundary of the lattice itself . in this work",
    "we will , however , mostly consider lattices without boundary .",
    "statements about lattices with boundary can then be obtained as simple corollaries .",
    "therefore , the distinction between interior and boundary sites within a cell such as shown in fig .",
    "( [ kagome ] ) will not depend on the position of the cell within the lattice .",
    "to proceed , we will now define a certain class of states living on the local cells .",
    "we will refer to these states as `` local valence bond states '' .",
    "this does , however , not imply that these states completely dimerize the cell , i.e. that every site of the cell must participate in a valence bond within the cell .",
    "rather , we think of these states as local `` snapshots '' of a lattice that is in a ( globally defined ) nearest neighbor valence bond state .",
    "in such a snapshot , every internal site of the cell must certainly form a valence bond with one of its nearest neighbors within the cell .",
    "a boundary site of the cell , however , may or may not participate in a valence bond with a site within the cell under consideration . in particular , it may participate in a valence bond with a site _ outside _ that cell . in the latter case ,",
    "the local density matrix describing the state of the cell contains no information about the state of the spin of such a boundary site .",
    "this motivates the following definition of local valence bond `` snapshot '' states on the cell @xmath6 .",
    "let us consider states of the form @xmath7 here , @xmath8 represents a dimer covering of the cell @xmath6 . by this",
    "we mean a pairing of the sites of the cell @xmath6 into nearest neighbor pairs , where each internal site is a member of a pair , but not necessarily each boundary site .",
    "an example for such a pairing is given for the cell of the star lattice shown in fig .",
    "( [ star_cellstuff]d ) , and that of the square lattice shown in fig .",

    "( [ snapshot ] ) , the state @xmath10 then denotes any state of the `` free '' sites that are left untouched by the dimer covering @xmath8 .",
    "this can again be seen in figs .",
    "( [ star_cellstuff]d ) , ( [ square3]c ) . in ( [ square3]c ) , every dimer covering @xmath8 leaves behind at least one free site , because of the odd number of sites in this cell . for cells of even size , we leave it understood that the factor @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ snapshot ] ) is absent if @xmath8 covers all sites of the cell .",
    "we find it convenient to denote by @xmath11 the linear space formed by all local states of the form , for a _ fixed _",

    "( [ vb ] ) is _ direct_.",
    "this means that the expansion of any state in @xmath14 into members of the various spaces @xmath12 is possible in one and only one unique way . whenever this property holds for some cell @xmath13 , we will say that the nnvb states are `` locally independent '' on the cell @xmath13 , or satisfy the `` local independence property '' on the cell @xmath13 .",
    "the local independence property , whenever it can be established for some cell @xmath13 , extends to arbitrarily large lattices that can be covered by cells of this topology .",
    "said more precisely , we require that every link of the lattice belongs to a cell that has the topology of @xmath13.@xcite the linear independence of nnvb states defined on the entire lattice can then be seen as follows.@xcite if the sum in eq .",

    "said differently , the defining properties of these operators are @xmath17 we note that since the spaces @xmath12 are not orthogonal , the linear projection operators thus defined are not hermitian .",
    "we also mention that to define these operators in within the full @xmath18 dimensional hilbert space of the cell @xmath13 , we need to specify their action on a suitably chosen complement of the local valence bond space @xmath14 , which can be done in an arbitrary way . in the following , we will only need to know the action of these operators within the subspace @xmath14 .",
    "the operators @xmath16 can now be defined for any cell @xmath13 of some lattice @xmath19 , for which the nearest neighbor valence bond states are locally independent in the sense defined above .",

    "we will comment on the ( simpler ) case where the lattice has a boundary below .",

    "the operators @xmath64 defined above can then be extended to the full hilbert space of the large lattice , and there is an operator @xmath67 for any cell of the type @xmath13 with central site @xmath66 .",
    "the defining property then extends to valence bond states @xmath9 corresponding to full dimerizations @xmath8 of the lattice : @xmath9 survives the action of @xmath67 unchanged if the bonding state of site @xmath66 in the dimer covering @xmath8 is @xmath65 , otherwise it is annihilated .",
    "detailed arguments for this are identical to those referred to in sec .",
    "[ derivation ] .",
    "it is then clear that by successive action with the operators @xmath68 , one can single out any dimer covering @xmath8 in the linear combination eq .",
    "( [ lc ] ) , just as carried out in section [ derivation ] , and thus prove that the states @xmath9 are linearly independent .",
    "we have verified that for the cell in fig .",
    "( [ square3]b ) , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ vbcourse ] ) is indeed direct .",
    "the numerics were somewhat more challenging , due to size of the 25-site cell under consideration . to wit , this cell admits a total of 5376 different dimer coverings .",
    "each of the dimer coverings has seven `` free '' outer sites not touched by a dimer , thus the total dimension of the @xmath58-matrix is a staggering 5376 x 2@xmath69 = 688128 . to reduce the problem to blocks of manageable size , we use the full rotational invariance of the spaces appearing in eq .",
    "( [ vbcourse ] ) .",
    "that is , we chose the basis @xmath43 for the seven free sites to have a well - defined total spin @xmath70 , in addition to a well - defined @xmath44 .",
    "a suitable choice for a basis is obtained by choosing states corresponding to rumer - pauling diagrams.@xcite the advantage of this is that for appropriate normalization , the matrix elements of the @xmath58-matrix then remain integer , and we may again make use of exact integer arithmetic.@xcite we further used the mirror symmetry of the cell @xmath13 along one of its diagonals .",
    "the largest blocks occurring then had dimensions on the order of 30,000 .",
    "the above then establishes that for _ any _ sufficiently large square lattice with periodic boundary conditions , the set of all nnvb states is linearly independent .",
    "the same statement then follows for lattices with an edge as discussed at the end of section [ derivation ] .",
    "the case of general open boundaries conditions has also been treated previously with different methods in ref . .",
    "in the preceding sections , we have described a method for proving linear independence of nearest neighbor valence bond states on certain 2d lattices with and without periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this method , originally designed for the kagome lattice,@xcite was successfully extended here to the following lattice types : honeycomb , squagome , pentagonal and cairo pentagonal , square - octagon , martini - a , -b , and -c , archimedian - a and archimedean - b , and to the star lattice , and furthermore to fullerene - type lattices .",
    "subsequently , a refined method has been developed , which is applicable even in some cases where the original method is inadequate .",
    "specifically , this was found to be the case for the square lattice .",
    "our method is based on the identification of a certain local independence property for finite clusters , which , when established , implies the linear independence of nnvb states for arbitrarily large lattices . though here we prefer to validate the local independence property using exact numerical schemes , in those cases where smaller clusters are sufficient , a fully analytic approach is certainly feasible .",
    "further remarks on this for the kagome case , where the cluster size is fairly large , can be found in ref . .",
    "we note again that the linear independence of the nnvb states for the square , the honeycomb , and the square - octagon lattice was already established in a paper by chayes , chayes , and kivelson@xcite in 1989 .",
    "their result , however , applies only to the case of open boundary conditions . for these lattices",
    ", our result extends the one by chayes et al . to the case of periodic boundary conditions , using a different approach .",
    "we have also discussed various applications of these results in rvb inspired approaches to quantum spin-@xmath0 systems .",
    "a case of much interest , which we have not studied here , is that of the triangular lattice .",
    "we remark that since the square lattice can be thought of as a triangular lattice endowed with a coarser topology , obtained by removing certain nearest neighbor links , a candidate cell for the triangular lattice would have to be at least as large as our square lattice cell , fig .",
    "( [ square3]b ) , with many more links included .",
    "this renders the @xmath58-matrix so large that we did not find this problem tractable at present .",
    "we currently see , however , no fundamental reason why the refined method of the preceding section should not be applicable to this case as well . in all cases thus far studied , we have found that local cells large enough to have _ more _ internal sites than boundary sites generally have a sufficiently strong local independence property , which then implies the desired linear independence of globally defined nnvb states .",
    "the only exception to this rule seem to be lattices where this `` global '' linear independence does not hold , for obvious , `` local '' reasons : these include the checkerboard and the pyrochlore lattice , or any lattice featuring tetrahedral units . by looking at the three dimerizations of a single tetrahedron",
    ", it is easy to see that for such lattices , linear independence of nnvb states does not hold .",
    "( that is , as long as there is any dimer covering of the lattice with two dimers on the same tetrahedron . )",
    "thus far , we are not aware of rigorous results on the problem studied here for any three - dimensional lattices ( except for finite clusters ) .",
    "we are optimistic , however , that our method is at least applicable to the hyperkagome case , which has recently enjoyed much attention in the study of frustrated quantum magnets.@xcite a brute force study of the relevant local cell has so far been barred by its size .",
    "however , a formal analogy with the kagome case suggests that a partially analytic treatment of the local cell is possible.@xcite we leave this and other unexplored cases of interest for future studies ."
