    "this suggests that these structures may serve as extremely small memory devices .",
    "a first step in this direction is the investigation of specially grown structures where the charging of a layer of qds could be detected via its influence on the conductivity of a two dimensional electron gas @xcite .",
    "these experiments showed a pronounced bistability ( up to room temperature @xcite ) depending on the history of the bias sweep .",
    "the sensitivity to light illumination suggests a variety of applications in photoelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "a key issue towards a detailed understanding of these experiments is the question if the observed bistability is of transient nature , and the order of the time scales involved . in order to elucidate this point we performed a simulation of the experiment from ref .   applying a drift - diffusion model combined with the generation - recombination ( gr ) kinetics of the qds .",
