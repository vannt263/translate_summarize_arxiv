    "since the prediction of an exciton bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in a semiconductor@xcite , this electron - hole pair condensate has attracted much attention as an analogous phenomenon to metallic superconductivity , where electron - electron cooper - pairs play the central role . although the exciton bec has not been realized yet , recent experiments have explored sub - kelvin temperatures@xcite .",
    "thus , the realization of an exciton bec is very promising .",
    "once this fermi condensate is realized , it is expected that one can examine various physical properties of this system from the weak - coupling regime to the strong - coupling limit , by adjusting the exciton density . at a glance ,",
    "this advantage is similar to the case of a superfluid fermi atomic gas , where the interaction between fermi atoms is also tunable by adjusting the threshold energy of a feshbach resonance@xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the so - called bcs - bec crossover has been realized@xcite , where the character of superfluidity continuously changes from the weak - coupling bcs type to the bec of tightly bound molecules , with increasing the strength of a pairing interaction@xcite . however , while the cold atom system is usually in the equilibrium state , an exciton gas is essentially in the non - equilibrium state , because one always needs to continue supplying electrons and holes to the system , in order to compensate the decay of excitons into photons@xcite .",
    "thus , the realization of an exciton bec would provide a unique opportunity to examine the bcs - bec crossover phenomena in the non - equilibrium case . since non - equilibrium properties of a fermi condensate",
    "has recently been discussed in various systems , such as an exciton - polariton gas in a microcavity@xcite , as well as an ultracold fermi gas@xcite , an exciton bec would also contribute to the study in these fields .    in this paper",

    "[ fig2](b ) shows the sizable occupation of this branch , when the  biased voltage \" @xmath103 exceeds the energy gap @xmath27 . since the total number @xmath75 of electrons and holes remains unchanged in the steady state , the appearance of the bogoliubov ( unpaired ) quasi - particles",

    "extension of this simple treatment to include the realistic long range coulomb interaction , as well as pairing fluctuations at finite temperatures , is an exciting future problem .",
