    "in the last few years , the bcs - bec crossover in two - component fermi superfluids has become a central topic in ultracold atom physics@xcite .",
    "this crossover is of especial interest since the superfluidity continuously changes from the weak - coupling bcs - type to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of tightly bound cooper pairs , as one increases the strength of a pairing interaction@xcite .",

    "in contrast , all the atoms contribute to the superfluid density at @xmath5 , namely @xmath7 .    in a companion paper , we have discussed some analytical results for the superfluid density @xmath0 in the bcs - bec crossover regime of a uniform superfluid fermi gas@xcite .",
    "going past the weak - coupling bcs theory , we derived an expression for @xmath0 in the gaussian fluctuation level in terms of the fluctuations in the cooper channel .",
