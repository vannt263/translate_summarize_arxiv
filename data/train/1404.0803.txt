    "unstable modes in wakes behind axisymmetric bluff bodies aligned with the outer flow have been the aim of several studies in the past , and it is now well known that the sequence of transitions towards unsteadiness in the laminar regime is governed by the destabilization of helical modes with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath12  ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* among others ) . regarding wakes behind rotating bluff bodies",
    ", @xcite performed a linear stability analysis showing that the helical mode is responsible for the instability of the wake of a spinning sphere .",
    "moreover , he showed that this mode leads to a co - rotating _ frozen _ flow  @xcite , where the vortices rotate without change in shape nor in intensity , resembling results previously reported for other swirling flows .",
    "for instance , it is well known that spiral vortex breakdown occurs as a consequence of the destabilization of a helical global mode , characterized by a co - rotating wave  @xcite .",
    "similarly ,  @xcite found through a temporal stability analysis that the batchelor vortex is unstable to a long - wave co - rotating helical mode for moderate values of the reynolds number and the swirl parameter .",
    "however , the stability of the flow past spinning bodies still needs to be thoroughly addressed .",
    "recent numerical simulations have revealed important differences between the stability properties of the wake of a spinning bullet - shaped body  @xcite , and that of a rotating sphere  @xcite .",
    "indeed , while the axisymmetric state is stabilized by a moderate amount of rotation for the bullet - shaped body , it is destabilized in the case of the sphere .",
    "such differences are apparently related to the stabilizing effect associated with the body base , allowing recovery of the axisymmetry of the wake under certain conditions . however , the behaviour of this stabilizing effect for bullet - like bodies at high rotation parameters has not been explored , since the determination of the bifurcations by means of three - dimensional numerical simulations is an extremely time - consuming task in marginally stable cases .",
    "thus , in the present work we use a global linear analysis to explore the stability limits of the axisymmetric steady state for moderate and high values of the rotation parameter and low reynolds numbers , while also providing valuable information about the physics of the problem at a considerably smaller computational cost .    as already mentioned , the application of rotation to a bullet - shaped body allows retrieval of the axisymmetry within certain ranges of the rotation velocity and reynolds number , suggesting its use as a passive control method .",
    "therefore , establishing the region of the @xmath13-plane where the axisymmetric flow is stable has great interest from a practical point of view , since its boundaries provide the critical values for which the flow past the spinning body is completely stabilized . to this end",
    ", the global stability analysis technique seems an appropriate tool , since it has been proved to accurately predict the bifurcations from the axisymmetric state in non - rotating bullet - shaped bodies  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the modal solutions of the navier - stokes equations linearized around the basic axisymmetric state constitute , together with the corresponding adjoint problem , the first step towards a deeper understanding of the sensitivity and receptivity of the flow , aimed at finding efficient control strategies  @xcite . therefore , the present work could also be used in the future as a starting point for a more complete study , where the control of wakes behind spinning bodies is achieved by slightly perturbing the base flow according to its sensitivity characteristics .",
    "this paper begins with the problem formulation and details of the numerical techniques , which are presented in   [ formulation ] .",
    "results and discussions about the leading global modes and their corresponding stability boundaries within the ranges @xmath14 and @xmath3 , are included in   [ sectresults ] .",
    "more specifically , in   [ sectresultsa ] , we show the results for @xmath15 , which have been used to validate the stability code for spinning bodies , comparing its results with previous three - dimensional numerical simulations . in   [ sectresultsb ] we include results for @xmath16 , obtained by means of the stability analysis , as well as several three - dimensional numerical simulations performed to complement our previous work and to identify new nonlinear bifurcated regimes , allowing us to define a complete bifurcation diagram in the ( @xmath17)-parametric plane .",

    "in fact , at @xmath70 , a modified unsteady ss mode arises ( figure  [ 0p1]b ) , where the two counter - rotating vortices are no longer symmetric , since the thread of positive axial vorticity , @xmath71 , becomes more intense due to the rotation of the body base , while the negative one is weakened .",
    "the main feature of this unsteady mode is that the vortical structures rotate with an angular velocity ( which is an increasing function of @xmath10 ) different from that of the body , without variation in strength or shape , being thus denoted as _ frozen state _  ( similarly to the regime described for the sphere by * ? ? ?",

    "the instability of the lf mode ( arising from a hopf bifurcation ) is responsible for the bifurcation towards the _ frozen state _ described above ( see figure  [ 0p1]b ) . moreover , as expected from the characteristics of the frozen state described in  [ sectresults0 ] , the angular frequency of the lf mode , @xmath86 , increases with @xmath10 , and it is stabilized by rotation , since increasing @xmath10 decreases the real part of the corresponding eigenvalue , @xmath87 . for the particular value of @xmath62 ,",

    "* ) and opens the recirculation bubble .",
    "consequently , the fluid inside the recirculating region is released , giving rise to axial vorticity tails in the wake . due to the planar symmetry of the ss mode ,",
    "the flow between cores occurs in both , the positive and the negative azimuthal directions .",
    "when rotation is applied in our bullet - like body , an axisymmetric linear distribution of azimuthal velocity is imposed at the body base .",
    "therefore , the flow induced between the two vortex cores is reduced in the azimuthal direction opposite to the spin , decreasing the intensity of the axial vorticity thread in this direction , and promoting the one rotating with the base . this effect can be observed in figure  [ ax_vort ] , where axial vorticity @xmath71 contours from numerical simulations are plotted for @xmath90 and increasing values of @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , figure  [ ax_vort ] reveals that the planar symmetry associated with the ss mode at @xmath73 ( figure [ ax_vort]a ) is broken when rotation is applied , due to the injection of positive vorticity from the body base ( see figure [ ax_vort]b for @xmath69 ) that promotes the positive tail and weakens the negative one .",
    "additionally , a shroud of negative @xmath71 develops from the nose when the body spins .",
    "this effect becomes stronger as the angular velocity of the body increases , until eventually the axisymmetry is retrieved at a critical value of @xmath10 , what is indeed generally observed for @xmath205 .",
    "for instance , at @xmath90 the stabilization occurs at @xmath206 , as is evidenced by figure  [ ax_vort]c .    following the results of  @xcite for the sphere , which demonstrated that the bifid wake ( ss mode ) is a combination of the axisymmetric base flow plus the linear @xmath207 mode ( with a weak nonlinear correction ) , an explanation for the retrieving of axisymmetry",
    "could also be elaborated in terms of global modes properties .",
    "thus , the weakening of the ( now rotating ) bifid topology with increasing spin velocity might be seen as the combined effect of a stronger azimuthal base flow velocity and a weaker amplitude of the @xmath82 perturbation velocity  ( in line with figure 8 in * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the weakening of the amplitude of the dominant unstable mode ( lf mode ) as @xmath10 grows , should lead to a better prediction of strouhal numbers for the subdominant mode ( hf mode ) , as suggested by the results of  @xcite . indeed , these authors discussed , in terms of the dependence of @xmath208 with @xmath9 , the errors associated with the use of an axisymmetric base flow to predict the destabilization of the subdominant linear mode beyond the first axisymmetry - breaking bifurcation ( see figure 12 in their paper ) .",
    "this allowed  @xcite to interpret the results of the global stability of the flow around a sphere performed by  @xcite , highlighting the fact that the subdominant linear mode must become unstable for the onset of vortex shedding to take place . in the case at hand , due to the proximity of both bifurcations at @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the vicinity of @xmath209 ,",
    "not only the prediction of @xmath208 for the subdominant hf mode is satisfactory , but also for the second bifurcation  ( note that for @xmath73 there is an important underprediction of @xmath208 and an overprediction of @xmath210 for the rsp mode by the stability analysis , according to * ? ? ?",
    "thus , under these conditions the performance of the stability analysis beyond the axisymmetry breaking bifurcation improves with respect to the case without rotation , similarly to what occurs for the wake of a disk  @xcite .     on the axisymmetric base flow ( a )",

    "note that the latter value of the reynolds number is close to the marginal conditions for a wide range of rotation parameters . from the results of figure",
    "[ bf_analysis](a ) it is deduced that , as @xmath10 increases , the recirculation region enlarges and the maximum backflow velocity decreases , leading to a decrease in the radial gradient of axial velocity , similar to the effect of base bleed  @xcite .",
    "this resulting reduction of axial shear might contribute to stabilize the wake , since , as shown by  @xcite , reverse flow is known to promote local absolute instability for non - rotating cases  ( which is in fact connected to the existence of global instability , as demonstrated for the sphere by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it could have a similar effect when rotation is applied .",
    "moreover , this reduction of axial velocity gradients at high @xmath10 renders the flow more parallel .",
    "consequently , in line with the results obtained at high bleed coefficients for the wake of the body without rotation  @xcite , where the slenderness of the flow justifies the use of local parallel base flow , a local stability analysis at several downstream locations from the base using a quasi - parallel flow approximation , might characterize approximately the transition between region i and iv defined in figure  [ transitions ] . on the contrary , at low @xmath10 , the deviation from parallel flow in the near wake would surely lead to discrepancies between the critical parameters determining the occurrence of local absolute instability and the onset of global self - sustained oscillations , as shown for the cylinder  @xcite and the non - rotating sphere  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", figure  [ bf_analysis](a ) shows an incipient inflection point in the centerline axial velocity near the body ( at @xmath215 approximately ) that , at higher angular velocities , could lead to the formation of a second recirculation bubble , resembling the _ vortex breakdown _ phenomenon , although this hypothesis should be explore in the future .",
    "the results depicted in figure  [ bf_analysis](b ) also show that the base pressure decreases as @xmath10 increases , leading to an increase in the drag force , while the axial location of the minimum pressure is displaced downstream , reflecting the enlargement of the recirculation region .",
    "let us finally discuss our results in the light of related studies that deal with the stability of rotating flows , as well as with the theory of equivariant bifurcations .",
    "the introduction of body rotation results in an axisymmetry breaking flow , through supercritical hopf bifurcations , associated with the lf , mf and hf eigenmodes found in the present work . note that , this type of bifurcating behaviour has been previously reported in other configurations like enclosed rotating flows  @xcite , or a counter - rotating taylor - couette flow  @xcite .",
    "this bifurcating scenario is a consequence of the invariance of the base flow under arbitrary rotations around the axis , constituting a @xmath11-symmetric configuration which , as revealed by the theory of equivariant bifurcations , leads to _ rotating waves _ , i.e. solutions that are steady in a reference frame that rotates with an appropriate angular velocity  @xcite .",
    "the results reported herein , clearly demonstrate that the low - frequency , the medium - frequency and the high - frequency frozen wakes , that appear as a consequence of the destabilization of the lf , mf and hf eigenmodes respectively , indeed match the characteristics of _ rotating wave _ states . on the other hand ,",
    "once the next - to - leading eigenmode becomes unstable , the wake adopts a quasi - periodic motion with two characteristic frequencies through another hopf bifurcation , featuring an intrinsic unsteadiness that leads to vortex shedding in the wake , similar to the _ modulated wave _ states that appear in taylor - couette flow  @xcite and other enclosed swirling flows  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the global linear stability of the axisymmetric flow around a spinning bullet - shaped body of length - to - diameter ratio @xmath60 , as a function of the reynolds number , @xmath9 , and of the rotation parameter @xmath10 , which have been varied in the ranges @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the stability analysis has provided a detailed characterization of the unstable modes that appear in the wake and of its corresponding bifurcated states .",
    "first , it can be pointed out that axial shear drives generally the flow instability for low and moderate values of @xmath10 , as suggested by the fact that only helical ( @xmath216 ) global modes are destabilized for non - rotating bodies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) and rotating body wakes .",
    "this common instability mechanism is more pronounced at very low values of @xmath10 ( e.g. @xmath217 for the geometry considered herein ) , where , despite the unsteadiness , the flow topology resembles that of the ss mode for non - rotating bodies .",
    "however , rotation provides with a more complex and richer stability picture when @xmath10 increases .",
    "thus , in summary , three different co - rotating eigenmodes with helical azimuthal symmetry have been identified , each of them dominating the instability of the axisymmetric state in different regions of the @xmath218 parameter plane .",
    "the first eigenmode is a _ low - frequency mode _",
    ", destabilized for @xmath219 and @xmath220 , whose associated eigenfunction features structures with large axial wavelength , and is responsible for the nonlinear _ frozen state _ described in  @xcite . in the range of rotation parameters @xmath221 , a different _ high - frequency mode _ becomes destabilized for @xmath222 , with a much smaller axial wavelength , that gives rise , in the nonlinear regime , to an _ spiral frozen wake_. finally , a new _ medium - frequency mode _ has been found , that is destabilized for @xmath223 within a range of reynolds numbers that widens with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "the nonlinear counterpart of the medium - frequency mode has also been studied by means of unsteady three - dimensional numerical simulations , revealing a development into a co - rotating _",
    "frozen spiral _ topology of the wake , similar to that associated with the high - frequency mode .",
    "therefore , this new wake state can be described as a _ medium - frequency spiral frozen mode_. all these nonlinear regimes existing around the axisymmetric region in the parametric ( @xmath17)-map have been found to behave as _ rotating waves _ that , according to the theory of equivariant bifurcations , is a consequence of the @xmath11-symmetry of the base flow .",
    "the stability picture described in this work for the bullet - shaped body differs considerably from that of the sphere  @xcite . indeed , in contrast to what happens in the flow around a sphere , where streamwise rotation destabilizes the axisymmetric state , in the present case rotation acts as a control mechanism for moderate values of @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , no evidences of a mode similar to the medium - frequency one reported herein has been observed in the wake of a rotating sphere  @xcite .",
    "these differences are related to the effect of the body base on the flow field that , at low values of @xmath10 , enhances the generation of vorticity in a preferred sense , decreasing the intensity of the axial vorticity thread of opposite sign and contributing to retrieve the axisymmetry . however , the presence of the new unstable medium - frequency mode at higher values of @xmath10 limits this stabilizing effect of rotation .",
    "an analysis of the base flow has shown that , when rotation is applied , the value of the recirculating axial velocity decreases at the centerline , which fosters the stabilization of the wake at low values of @xmath10 ; but at high values of rotation parameter , the centrifugal mechanism increases the magnitude of the radial velocity at the base of the body , what might destabilize the incident stream at the rear edge , and consequently the wake .",
    "additionally , at high @xmath10 , an inflection point begins to develop at the centerline axial velocity distribution , that eventually could lead to the break - up of the recirculation bubble into two separate pieces , creating a flow topology that may resemble that of a vortex breakdown .",
    "this possibility , along with a deeper study on the influence of the body base in rotating blunt - based bodies ( e.g. disks or cylinders ) on the stability properties of the wake , arise as interesting topics for future work , that could shed more light on the complicated dynamics of swirling wakes past spinning bluff bodies .    on the other hand , some comments must be made on the controllability of the flow . in an initial attempt to evaluate the sensitivity of the flow to local modifications of the linear navier - stokes operator ( useful for passive control strategies implementation ) , it has been observed that , at low values of @xmath10 , slight base flow changes within the recirculation bubble , for instance by means of modifications in the boundary condition at the base ( e.g. adding some bleed ) , lead to important shift in the growth rate of the spectra dominant eigenvalues .",
    "consequently , we presume that the `` wakemaker '' is located within the recirculation bubble , in line with what has been observed for other axisymmetric bodies without rotation , such disks or spheres @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity to modifications in the base boundary condition seems to be smaller for high @xmath10 , so that it is likely that the wakemaker location changes with the spin value . however , further investigations are needed in the future to perform the identification of regions of large sensitivity .",
    "finally , the transition diagram obtained by means of the global linear stability analysis ( figure  [ transitions ] ) shows good quantitative agreement with the three - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "in fact , relative errors found in the critical reynolds numbers are lower than @xmath142 for @xmath15 , while the relative differences in the characteristic frequencies lie below @xmath224 for all @xmath10 and marginally unstable @xmath9 investigated .",
    "this result is interesting , not only from the practical point of view , in terms of computational efficiency , but also from the physical point of view , since it can be connected to the fact that the present flow is strongly non - parallel in the near wake and the convective non - normality might be moderate , which would minimize the risk of transient growth and noise - amplifier dynamics of the stable flow  @xcite .",
    "consequently , global linear stability analysis stands out as a powerful tool that predicts and properly characterizes the physics of the wake behind the spinning body around the stable region .",

    "<S> we analyze the global linear stability of the axisymmetric flow around a spinning bullet - shaped body of length - to - diameter ratio @xmath0 , as a function of the reynolds number , @xmath1 , and of the rotation parameter @xmath2 , in the ranges @xmath3 and @xmath4 . here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the free - stream and the body rotation velocities respectively , and @xmath7 is the fluid kinematic viscosity . the two - dimensional eigenvalue problem is solved numerically to find the spectrum of complex eigenvalues and their associated eigenfunctions , allowing us to explain the different bifurcations from the axisymmetric state observed in previous numerical studies . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal that , for the parameter ranges investigated herein , three global eigenmodes , denoted low - frequency ( lf ) , medium - frequency ( mf ) and high - frequency ( hf ) modes , become unstable in different regions of the @xmath8 parameter plane . </S>",
    "<S> we provide precise computations of the corresponding neutral curves , that divide the @xmath8 plane into four different regions : the stable axisymmetric flow prevails for small enough values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , while three different frozen states , where the wake structures co - rotate with the body at different angular velocities , take place as a consequence of the destabilization of the lf , mf and hf modes . </S>",
    "<S> several direct numerical simulations of the nonlinear state associated to the mf mode , identified here for the first time , are also reported to complement the linear stability results </S>",
    "<S> . finally , we point out the important fact that , since the axisymmetric base flow is @xmath11-symmetric , the theory of equivariant bifurcations implies that the weakly non - linear regimes that emerge close to criticality must necessarily take the form of _ rotating - wave states_. these states , previously referred to as _ frozen wakes _ in the literature , are thus shown to result from the base - flow symmetry . </S>"
