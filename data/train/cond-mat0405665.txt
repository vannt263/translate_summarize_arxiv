    "classical density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite is a remarkably successful theory for describing the rich behaviour of the equilibrium structure and thermodynamics of fluids in external potentials .",
    "dft has been used to describe a wide variety of fluid interfacial , confinement and even freezing phenomena ; for example , dft has been a vital tool in understanding the wetting behaviour and surface phase transitions of fluids adsorbed on various substrates @xcite . given the success of dft for describing static inhomogeneous fluids , it is of great interest to be able to build upon and incorporate these theories into a theory for the _ dynamics _ of inhomogeneous fluids .",
    "there have been several approaches to obtaining an equation of motion for the one body density profile @xmath0 of a classical fluid .",
    "the form that these theories takes depends somewhat on how the particular authors define @xmath0 . for some",
    ", @xmath0 is an `` ensemble '' average over the possible configurations of the system at time @xmath1 , given an ensemble of starting configurations at an earlier time @xmath2 . using this definition for @xmath0",
    ", there is clearly a unique density profile @xmath0 at a given time @xmath1 , and therefore the equation governing the dynamics of this density profile will be deterministic .",
    "this is the philosophy behind the approach of marconi and tarazona ( mt ) in refs .",
    "their approach obtains more formally some of the results proposed by earlier authors , such as evans @xcite and dieterich    et al    .",
    "@xcite , where it is assumed from the outset that the gradient of the chemical potential @xmath3 is the thermodynamic force driving a particle current @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a mobility constant .",
    "an expression for @xmath6 is obtained within dft by assuming that , as in the case of the equilibrium fluid , the chemical potential is given by the functional derivative of the helmholtz free energy functional with respect to the density profile @xcite .",
    "this assumption , together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : current ] ) and the continuity equation @xmath7 provide a basis for the deterministic formulation of dynamical dft ( ddft ) .",
    "equations of this form have been used , for example , to study the dynamics of freezing @xcite and of solvation @xcite .",
    "more recently , the more systematic approach of mt has been used with much success to describe the dynamics for several different systems .",
    "these applications refer to particles in various external , time dependent , potentials @xcite . for the systems considered",
    ", the agreement between theory and the results from brownian dynamics simulations have generally been very good .",
    "an alternative approach to obtaining a ddft is to view the fluid one body density profile ( denoted @xmath8 in order to distinguish it from @xmath0 , the `` ensemble '' averaged density profile ) as some sort of spatial and/or time coarse grained average of the density operator @xmath9 , where the @xmath10 are the positions of the @xmath11 particles in the system . in this case , for brownian particles , the equation governing the dynamics of @xmath8 will , of course , still contain a stochastic element .",
    "this is the viewpoint of a number of theories @xcite .",
    "there is some confusion in the literature @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) as to what precisely is meant by @xmath0 . we will attempt to clarify these issues elsewhere @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the deterministic viewpoint of mt and consider @xmath0 to be an ensemble average , i.e.  an average over all realisations of the stochastic noise in the preceding interval , until time @xmath1 .",
    "we employ the smoluchowski equation as the starting point for an alternative derivation of the ddft for classical fluids developed by mt in refs.@xcite . the present scheme for deriving the ddft bears some similarity in spirit to that given recently in ref .",

    "@xcite , proceeds as follows : for a fluid of @xmath11 brownian particles , one imagines applying a force on the particles , where the force on the @xmath12 particle is @xmath13 , ( @xmath14 is the set of position coordinates for the @xmath11 particles ) , so that the system is prevented from relaxing to its equilibrium distribution .",

    ". it is implicitly assumed that as the particles interact , the momentum degrees of freedom equilibrate much faster than the positional degrees of freedom , and we have effectively averaged over the momentum degrees of freedom , whilst keeping the particle coordinates fixed . for a colloidal fluid , this thermal equilibration should occur via the solvent , and this approximation should be a good one to make . for atomic fluids , this may not be the case , especially for particles interacting via harshly repulsive ( hard - sphere like ) potentials . for fluids interacting with softer potentials , such as in the gaussian core model @xcite , this might be a reasonable approximation to make , particularly when the fluid is at high densities where each particle interacts with a large number of neighbours and so the momentum degrees of freedom can equilibrate faster .",

    "the theory means that the theory should be applicable to colloidal fluids where because of interactions with the solvent particles the momentum degrees of freedom of the colloids equilibrate much faster than the positional degrees of freedom . in atomic fluids",
    "the equilibration timescale for the momentum degrees of freedom can be of the same order as that for the relaxation of positional degrees of freedom and therefore the present theory may break down for atomic fluids .",
    "however , because the correct equilibrium limit is built into this theory , i.e.when @xmath186 the theory is equivalent to eq.([eq : eleq ] ) , it is feasible that the present theory would give reasonable results for atomic fluids , assuming that one also has a reliable approximation for the excess helmholtz free energy functional , @xmath187 $ ] .",
