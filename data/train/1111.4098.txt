    "a transition - edge sensor ( tes ) is a thin superconducting film that can be used as a sensitive thermometer when voltage biased within the normal metal - superconducting transition region and read out with superconducting squid sensors @xcite .",
    "tes based devices are used as extremely sensitive bolometers and calorimeters to detect radiation in a wide energy range from gamma - rays to sub - millimeter radiation @xcite , and typically the thermal conductance to the bath is controlled by mounting the tes on a thin insulating sin membrane .",
    "although the performance of these detectors is already excellent , the most sensitive tes devices have not yet reached the theoretical limits in energy resolution .",
    "this is mostly due to excess noise that has been shown to be present in many devices @xcite .",
    "several candidates for the noise sources have been proposed , such as thermal fluctuations within the tes @xcite , fluctuations in the cooper - pair density @xcite or phase - slips @xcite , but a definitive answer is still missing .",
    "however , before resorting to more exotic noise sources to explain the data , one should be sure the known noise mechanisms are fully understood .",
    "these are the thermal fluctuations of the electrical degrees of freedom , or johnson noise , and the thermal fluctuations of the energy degrees of freedom , usually called thermal fluctuation noise or phonon noise @xcite .",
    "both of these noise mechanisms are unavoidable in bolometric tes detectors ; moreover , their magnitude depends on the details of the device in question .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to characterize the detector accurately , both electrically and thermally , before one can understand the origin of noise .",
    "a useful tool in characterizing tes detectors is the measurement of their frequency - dependent complex electrical impedance @xcite .",
    "importantly , within the transition this impedance depends not only on the electrical , but also on the thermal circuit of the device , through the electrothermal feedback effect @xcite . with the help of this technique ,",
    "a more accurate picture of the electrical and thermal properties of tes sensors has emerged : first of all , it was realized that the dependence of the detector resistance on current , and not only on temperature , is critical for the detector response , as well @xcite .",
    "this was later shown to influence the johnson noise directly @xcite , and some of the excess noise could then be explained as non - equilibrium johnson noise .",
    "in addition , it has become clear that for many detectors , the simplest thermal circuit of one heat capacity connected to heat bath through one thermal conductance is not adequate @xcite .",
    "a more complex thermal circuit then adds new components to the thermal fluctuation part of the noise spectrum @xcite .    here",
    ", we present a study of the noise and complex impedance of several different designs of tes devices . many of the devices are based on the so - called corbino - geometry tes ( cortes)@xcite , where current spreads out radially from a central contact with radius @xmath0 into the outer contact at @xmath1 , instead of flowing linearly [ fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ] .",
    "although it is a bit more complicated to fabricate , it offers advantages in modelling , as the superconducting and normal regions separate due to the non - uniform current density profile .",
    "this means that we can determine the phase boundary radius @xmath2 from the measured resistance @xmath3 , which depends logarithmically on @xmath4 in corbino geometry :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the normal state resistance of the device .",
    "once we know the size of the n and s phases , their expected theoretical heat capacities can be calculated as well .",
    "this level of theoretical description is not possible in more common square shaped tes devices .",
    "cortes has also shown an excess noise component , if compared to the simplest thermal model .",
    "this was originally explained by the fluctuations of the n - s boundary , or fluctuation superconductivity noise ( fsn ) @xcite .",
    "however , here we show that most of the `` excess '' noise is simply internal thermal fluctuation noise originating from a more complex thermal circuit within the device . by analyzing the data thoroughly , we suggest that most of the `` excess '' noise is generated by the thermal decoupling of the spatially separated superconducting and normal regions of the devices",
    ". data from typical square shaped devices also supports this picture : due to non - uniformities of real devices and/or the lateral proximity effect @xcite , phase separation can still take place , although not in such a controllable manner as in cortes devices .     and @xmath7 are the radii of the inner and outer superconducting contacts and @xmath2 is the phase boundary radius .",

    "the simplest thermal model of a tes device is shown in fig .",
    "[ block](a ) , consisting of a single heat capacity connected to the heat bath .",
    "the complex impedance @xmath8 of a device with this one - body thermal circuit always traces a semicircle in the complex plane as a function of frequency @xcite .",
    "thus , it is experimentally straightforward to determine whether a more complex thermal circuit is required by studying the shape of the @xmath8 curve .",
    "whenever additional thermal blocks are added to the system , @xmath8 develops bulges outwards from the ideal case ( see fig .",
    "[ mvsitfn ] ( a ) ) . the shape and size of the new features in @xmath8",
    "depend on the heat capacities @xmath9 of the added bodies and the thermal conductance links @xmath10 between them , in such a way that the features grow in size with both @xmath9 and @xmath11 .    ]",
    "[ mvsitfn ] ( a ) shows a typical measured impedance curve of a cortes device , together with a one- , two- and three - body theoretical model fits . although simpler one and two - body models seem to fit some device designs by other groups @xcite , for our devices a three - body model is the simplest model that fits the data well , as is clear from fig . [ mvsitfn ] ( a ) .",
    "recently , simple three - body models have also been used by other groups for more accurate modelling of their devices @xcite .    ]    in this work , we have therefore used the thermal model shown in fig .",
    "[ block](b ) , which is the simplest three - body model that is physically justifiable for our devices .",
    "in addition to the tes film with heat capacity @xmath12 where the bias power @xmath13 is dissipated , there is a hanging thermal body with heat capacity @xmath14 , and an intermediate heat capacity @xmath15 between the tes and the heat bath .",
    "@xmath16 could be associated with the supporting sin membrane , and @xmath14 could represent the absorber on top of a tes film [ fig . 1 ( b ) ] ,",
    "but in general it could be some other part of the device also .",
    "most devices studied here do not actually have absorbers .",
    "we call this the ih ( intermediate + hanging ) model , and use analytical expressions for the impedance and noise of a tes with this thermal circuit presented in @xcite .",
    "their derivation and full theoretical discussion will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we simply note that with each new thermal block , a new thermal noise source is also introduced to the system , arising from fluctuations in energy between the bodies through the thermal link .",
    "we call the noise due to any additional block internal thermal fluctuation noise ( itfn ) to distinguish it from the thermal noise between the system and the heat bath ( phonon noise )",
    ".      the intermediate body is characterized by its temperature @xmath17 and heat capacity @xmath15 .",
    "we emphasize that we do not make the simplifying assumptions that @xmath18 or that @xmath19 , when the tes is biased .",
    "associated with the intermediate block , we thus have four different values of dynamic thermal conductance , two for each physical link connected to @xmath15 , evaluated at each temperature end of the link @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be calculated from a careful analysis of the measured i - v characteristics , as described in ref @xcite .",
    "in our fitting procedure we use @xmath17 , @xmath15 and @xmath22 as the free parameters . the other unknown conductances",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are then calculated using the free parameters and the known values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , as @xcite @xmath28 to simplify the model and to minimize fitting parameters , it is also assumed that the links on both sides of the intermediate block have the same thermal exponent @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this is physically reasonable if all the conductances are dominated by the phononic transport properties of the sin membrane .",
    "later , we will show that the intermediate body fitting parameters are nearly constant throughout the transition , and only change when @xmath32 is changed .",
    "also , @xmath15 appears to depend on both the area and thickness of the membrane .",
    "this behavior is thus consistent with the assumption that the intermediate body represents the sin membrane phonons . furthermore , @xmath33 is usually always slightly below @xmath21 , and not close to the bath temperature .",
    "in contrast to the intermediate body , the second added heat capacity @xmath14 in our model is hanging [ fig .",
    "[ block ] ( b ) ] , which means that no steady state power flows through it , and the average values of @xmath26 and @xmath34 are equal .",
    "this simplifies the description in comparison to the intermediate body , as only one thermal conductance @xmath35 is required .",
    "the joule power of the tes bias current is all assumed to be dissipated inside @xmath12 . in real x - ray and @xmath36-ray devices with thick absorbers on top of the tes film @xcite",
    ", @xmath14 could well be the absorber , in which case @xmath35 describes the thermal conduction within the tes and the absorber . in devices without an absorber ( most samples in this work ) , the idea is to model electronic degrees of freedom , thus @xmath35 models the thermal conduction within the tes film .",
    "the hanging block is naturally still a simplification , in reality there can be also a thermal coupling from @xmath37 directly to the bath or to @xmath38 .",
    "however , the effect of the missing link , which would have a magnitude of the order of @xmath39 , is believed to be minor for the devices studied here , where @xmath35 is much larger than @xmath39 , as will be seen later .",
    "any effects of temperature gradients within the tes film are also not captured in this simple model .",
    "numerical estimates of the gradients within a cortes device @xcite have shown that the isothermal simplification is a reasonable assumption .",
    "for the cortes devices with phase separated n and s regions , one may at this point wonder , if the blocks @xmath12 and @xmath37 could actually directly represent the normal and superconducting regions of the tes film , respectively .",
    "the great benefit of the cortes geometry is that we can a priori calculate the values of @xmath12 and @xmath37 as a function of bias , which is not possible for the more standard square shaped devices . as we later show",
    ", the fitted values of the heat capacities and their behavior as a function of bias point do indeed follow a trend predicted by this interpretation .",
    "@xmath35 is thus still the electronic thermal conductance , but now it can be affected by the location of the ns boundary , for example .",
    "understanding of how @xmath35 should behave as a function of the bias ( phase boundary location ) is quite sketchy at the moment , and it needs to be studied further theoretically .",
    "the hanging body @xmath37 produces internal thermal fluctuation noise ( itfn ) that appears in current noise spectra at the high - frequency side of the effective thermal time constant , just like johnson noise @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ mvsitfn ] ( b ) .",
    "in addition , when @xmath40 is large enough , the roll - off for the itfn noise occurs at very high frequencies , even above the electrical cut - off frequency of the read - out circuit .",
    "thus , the itfn noise produced by the hanging body can look very similar to the johnson noise .",
    "quite often in the past , excess noise in tes devices has been quantified by the parameter @xmath41 @xcite , which is a measure of excess johnson noise .",
    "thus , one has to be very careful about drawing conclusions based on just the noise data : if the thermal circuit is not adequately characterized , one can misinterpret itfn noise as excess johnson noise . in our devices the time constant for itfn roll - off is indeed near the electric cut - off of our read - out circuit , so that fitting the spectra either with the three - body itfn model , or two - body + excess johnson noise ( @xmath41 parameter ) give almost identical results , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mvsitfn ] ( b ) .",
    "the only difference seen is that with the itfn model , the roll - off has a steeper slope , as it is a higher order roll - off produced by the combination of the thermal and electrical circuits . however , the point is that in many cases the impedance can only be fitted with the three block model [ see fig .",
    "[ mvsitfn ] ( a ) ] , which supports the choice of itfn noise over other noise sources .",
    "the experiments were performed in a compact homemade dilution refrigerator with a base temperature @xmath42 mk .",
    "the tes devices were voltage biased by a shunt resistor ( 8.9 m@xmath43 ) at the sample stage , and a nist two - stage squid @xcite mounted on the 1 k stage ( equivalent input current noise density @xmath44 pa/@xmath45 and geometric input inductance of 300 nh ) served as the current amplifier for the readout .",
    "the squid was operated in the flux locked loop , with dedicated room temperature electronics designed by sron .",
    "more details on the setup can be found in @xcite .",
    "all studied tes devices were first characterized by measuring their resistance vs. temperature transitions with a four - probe lock - in measurement , to find the normal state resistance @xmath46 and critical temperature @xmath47 .",
    "next , each detector was connected to the squid readout , and a series of current - voltage ( i - v ) curves was measured at several different bath temperatures .",
    "the thermal exponent @xmath29 was extracted from the @xmath48 dependence of the i - v data , as explained in ref . @xcite .",
    "then , using the known @xmath29 , the tes temperature @xmath26 and dynamic thermal conductance @xmath27 at any point in the transition were determined from the i - v curves @xcite .",
    "we also calculated the transition steepness parameter @xmath49 , which is a dimensionless measure of the sensitivity of the tes @xcite .",
    "finally , a set of noise and complex impedance measurements were performed at a desired @xmath32 and at various bias points within the transition .",
    "the tes impedance was extracted from the measured circuit impedance by dividing out the effect of the read - out circuit transfer function , as described in ref",
    ". @xcite . from the tes",

    "we have performed impedance measurements between 4 hz and 100 khz both by the white noise method @xcite , where a white noise excitation is used and the broadband response is measured , and by the lock - in method where a sinusoidal excitation is used at certain frequency points @xcite .",
    "both methods can in general be used , however , we have seen that the sine - wave method is more reliable , as the total heating power generated by the excitation is typically less in the sine - wave method .",
    "data with heating problems could be identified by the consistency check mentioned above : with excess heating @xmath62 did not agree with @xmath58 , indicating a heating induced shift in the bias point .",
    "the measured impedance and noise data are finally fitted _ simultaneously _ to the ih model equations .",
    "we emphasize that the fitting is done by eye , and free fit parameters are varied manually , as high - dimensional non - linear least - squares fitting would be demanding to implement . in some cases we found that the three - body equations still did not explain all the observed noise , even if the impedance fit was good . in those cases",
    "we have quantified the remaining truly excess noise as excess johnson noise using the m - parameter .",
    "note also that although here we only show the complex plane plots of @xmath8 , we also make sure that the real and imaginary parts fit separately as a function of frequency . included in the fits , but not shown in the plots because of their small values ,",
    "are the johnson noise of the known shunt resistor , and the equivalent white input noise of the squid .",
    "we have also used the equation for the ( lowest order ) non - equilibrium tes johnson noise @xcite @xmath63 in the analysis for all the devices .",
    "even though @xmath8 is measured only up to 100 khz , the theory curves are always calculated up to 2 mhz , in order to see the high - frequency differences between the fits , as demonstrated in section [ sec : slice1 ] .",
    "in this section we present the measured data and fit results from several different detectors .",
    "table [ testable ] lists some of the key parameters for each device studied .",
    "most of them have radially spreading current distribution as in the fully circulary symmetric cortes device shown in fig .",

    "the effect of the analysis case on the obtained @xmath41-parameter values vs the bias point is shown in fig .",
    "[ mbetactot ] ( a ) .",
    "in addition , the chosen fitting case has a big effect also on @xmath108 , as it is proportional to @xmath51 [ fig .",
    "[ mbetactot ] ( b ) ] .",
    "the plots remind us that many parameters strongly depend on the chosen thermal model and how it is interpreted .",
    "if we do not know with certainty which of the possible thermal models is correct , we should not jump to conclusions about the nature of the excess noise based on the dependence of @xmath41 parameter on bias , magnetic field etc .",
    "in other words , the @xmath8 data may look like it fits a simpler one- or two - block model , but the underlying true model could still be different .",
    "for example , if one is developing a detector where @xmath108 is an important parameter , mistakes can be made in tes design if the decisions are based on @xmath108 from a wrong fit . for the case of this particular device , we believe that cases 1 and 2 are more accurate because of the evidence from the other samples studied here , where two - block model fits are impossible to the impedance data .",
    "and ( c ) the sum of @xmath93 and @xmath103 between different fits cases .",
    "symbols : values from fits .",
    "line : bcs heat capacity with the bilayer correction , dashed line , full bcs theory .",
    "[ mbetactot ] ]    another interesting point to notice is that even though we have three different sets of values for @xmath93 and @xmath103 , the sums @xmath109 are essentially constant between the different fitting cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mbetactot](c ) .",
    "the values are also consistent with the modified bcs theory @xcite , except at the lowest bias points , where the rapid increase mentioned before is clearly seen .    at this point",
    "we wish to speculate about the observations at low bias points . a possible scenario for the effects seen",
    "( increasing @xmath70 , increasing @xmath41-noise ) could well be related to vortex physics .",
    "if vortices are not pinned , they could contribute to heat capacity and also generate excess noise by the so called phase - slip shot noise mechanism @xcite .",
    "the sudden drop in @xmath110 is also correlated with the onset of the need for @xmath41- parameter in case 1 .",
    "the lower @xmath60 would then correspond to extra resistance in the transition , caused by the vortex motion . in this light",
    "we can perhaps also understand why the full cortes devices do not require @xmath41 to fit their noise , as the extra nb top layer over the tes film may pin vortices more strongly , and prevent the generation of excess phase slip noise .",
    "another option is that some of the excess @xmath41-noise could be generated by the fsn mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , fsn theory in its current state can not explain the increased heat capacity or lowered @xmath60 .",
    "the geometrical design of slice tes sample 2 was identical to sample 1 , however the sin and tes layer thickness are different ( table [ testable ] ) , resulting also to a higher @xmath79 .",
    "in contrast to sample 1 , the second slice tes featured a more complicated transition with very large peaks in @xmath58 as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ 111fits](b ) .",
    "the high values and large variation in @xmath58 produces complicated impedance features and high noise levels .",
    "sample 2 was also measured at four different bath temperatures : 140 mk , 110 mk , 85 mk and 60 mk .",
    "[ 111fits ] shows the data for a few representative bias points measured at a bath temperature of 60 mk .",
    "the fits were done with the full ih model using case 2 , keeping @xmath12 free .",
    "now case 3 is again out of the question due to the complex shapes of the @xmath8-data .",
    "case 1 was tried but did not produce as good fits as case 2 .",
    "insets : ( a ) sem image of the tes , ( b ) total @xmath101 calculated from i - v .",
    "[ 111fits ] ]    again , the main features of both @xmath8 and noise data are captured with the ih model . however , at bias points where @xmath60 is very large ( for example @xmath111 ) it was more difficult to find good fits , and determination of @xmath51 is more uncertain .",
    "the inevitable result of this is more scatter in the fitted parameters . in fig .",
    "[ 111param ] we have plotted all the results from all four bath temperature runs in one graph , as @xmath12 , @xmath103 and @xmath40 should not depend on @xmath32 at all according to the thermal model ( @xmath38 depends on @xmath48 through its influence on @xmath112 , thus we show only @xmath113 60 mk fits ) . comparing to sample 1 , we see that @xmath12 and @xmath37 have the same trends , and only slightly higher values , consistent with the increase of @xmath79 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath38 is three times larger .",
    "this again supports the picture that @xmath38 originates from the sin membrane , as it is 2.5 times thicker for sample 2 .",
    "@xmath40 is of the same order of magnitude , and does not follow a monotonous trend throughout the whole transition .",
    "most of the noise data did not require any additional @xmath41-noise , all the fits shown in fig .",
    "[ 111fits ] are without the @xmath41 parameter .",
    "this , we speculate , could be because of the much higher @xmath60 compared to sample 1 : the themal noise grows so much that is swamps any possible additional noise sources .",
    ", except @xmath38 is shown only at @xmath113 60 mk .",
    "( a ) squares : @xmath99 , circles : @xmath114 and triangles : @xmath100 .",
    "dashed black and solid red lines are theoretical calculations for @xmath99 and @xmath89 , respectively , whereas the dash - dotted line is their sum .",
    "the reduced bcs value @xcite was used for @xmath103 .",
    "[ 111param ] ]    the data for @xmath115 was not shown because it depends on the bath temperature .",
    "for comparison with sample 1 , at 60 mk sample 2 had @xmath116 = 1.1 nw / k and @xmath117 = 0.97",
    "nw / k at 0.5 @xmath118 .    as can be seen for bias point @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ 111fits ] , the measured noise sometimes develops a peak near the high - frequency roll - off , when the tes is biased low in the transition .",
    "this indicates electrothermal oscillations and it is predicted by our thermal model , as shown by the fit .",
    "it arises due to a resonant - like interaction between the electrical and thermal circuits : when @xmath103 starts to decouple from a tes that has a very small heat capacity and large enough @xmath101 , the tes response becomes oscillatory .",
    "the increased responsivity means that all noise sources develop a peak , including the johnson noise , for example .",
    "finally , we show also results for a simple square tes . the measured detector was a bare @xmath120 tes with nb bias lines and no extra features added ( more sample parameter details in table [ testable ] ) .",
    "it has a smoothly changing @xmath121 with a fairly low maximum value of 50 . in fig .",
    "[ ttesfits ] we plot the measured and fitted impedance and noise data .",
    "just as for all the other geometries , our square tes clearly has a large high frequency noise component .",
    "again , the shapes of the impedance curves shows that the model without a hanging block ( case 3 discussed in section [ sec : slice1 ] ) will not work here either .",
    "the ih model again produces a very good fit for both @xmath8 and noise , which gives us confidence that the noise in the square tes can be explained by the same mechanism as in the other geometries .",
    "note that no @xmath41 parameter was needed in these fits .    ]    fig .",
    "[ ttesparam ] shows the relevant parameters from the fits .",
    "we again observe a decreasing @xmath12 and an increasing @xmath37 , consistent with our model of thermal decoupling of the n and s regions , and comparable values to the corbino - like samples . to calculate",
    "some estimate for the n and s phase heat capacities , we take a crude model of a linear transition , where the ratio of the volumes is given directly by @xmath98 , so for example in the middle of the transition we would have exactly half of the device in the superconducting state .",
    "this model produces a correct order of magnitude for @xmath12 and @xmath37 , but naturally no real agreement , although the parameter values do seem to change linearly with @xmath3 , as our overly simple model predicts .",
    "the values of thermal conductances are again consistent with the corbino devices , and @xmath35 does not show any simple dependence on @xmath3 .    .",
    "lines show the simple estimates for @xmath12 ( dashed ) and @xmath37 ( solid ) discussed in the text .",
    "[ ttesparam ] ]",
    "we have fabricated several different geometrical designs of tes devices , and studied their impedance and noise properties .",
    "all data are consistent with the picture that a three block thermal circuit is required to accurately describe the data . in all devices ,",
    "the fitted heat capacity values follow trends which suggest that one of the extra heat capacity blocks arises from the insulating films such as the sin membrane and , if present , the alox layer used in some devices .",
    "the other two blocks seem to represent the normal and superconducting regions of the tes film itself , with the observation that the finite value of thermal conductance within the tes film ( or a possible thermal boundary resistance between the n and s phases ) , in combination with the large value of the heat capacity in the superconducting phase near @xmath79 , leads to fairly large observable features in the impedance and noise data at high frequencies . in most cases",
    ", this internal thermal fluctuation noise component explains all of the `` excess noise '' in the devices .",
    "however , in some devices indications of additional noise sources remained , especially low in the transition .    in our ti / au devices the resistivity of the tes film is such that @xmath40 is `` low enough '' . by this",
    "we mean that the resulting cut - off frequency of the itfn noise due to the hanging block is near the electrical cut - off of the readout , so that we can observe its effect in the measured data . our data , therefore , agrees with the previous suggestion that a large itfn noise exists in ti / au tess @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the lower resistivity mo / au or mo / cu devices usually have a lower excess noise level that is white voltage noise , in other words noise that looks like excess johnson noise @xcite .",
    "our model could perhaps explain part of this difference between ti based and mo based devices through the higher thermal conductance @xmath35 of the mo / au and mo / cu tes films .",
    "if @xmath35 grows , the itfn noise level will fall , and the cut - off is pushed to a higher frequency .",
    "thus if the itfn roll - off happens much after the readout cut - off , itfn noise will look like excess johnson noise in the frequency range of the measurement .",
    "more measurements on mo devices are required to test this hypothesis .",
    "the results reported here indicate that in an optimal tes design , the internal thermal conductances within the metallic parts of the device ( tes film , absorber ) should be maximized .",
    "as the actual phase separation between the superconducting and normal regions may be impossible to prevent , the effect of the superconducting heat capacity is minimized if the heat capacity of the normal part of the tes is larger .",
    "we note that the leading designs in terms of reported energy resolution @xcite employ added normal metal features , and thus we speculate that the reduction of their noise could originate , at least partly , due to the increased normal region heat capacity .",
