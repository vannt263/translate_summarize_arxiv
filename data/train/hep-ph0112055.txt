    "in this talk we consider a class of one - loop integrals occurring in heavy - particle theories @xcite , with arbitrary real values for the external masses and residual momenta . we give the results of complete analytical computations of three - point loop integrals with and without velocity change , and two - point loop integrals .",
    "the details of the calculations are given in @xcite , and in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the loop integrals we consider are of the form , @xmath0 here @xmath1 , @xmath2 , are the velocities of the external heavy legs , @xmath3 their residual momenta , and @xmath4 their mass splittings relative to the common heavy mass of the corresponding heavy quark symmetry multiplet . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the masses of the light particles within the loops , which in chiral theories are light pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "these integrals are defined in @xmath7 dimensions , @xmath8 being the mass scale of dimensional regularization .",
    "their degrees of divergence are @xmath9 for @xmath10 , @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "the factor of 2 in front of @xmath1 corresponds to our normalization of the heavy - particle propagators .",
    "our method of calculation @xcite is to obtain the integrals ( [ eq : ints ] ) as large - mass limits of ordinary loop integrals .",
    "we closely follow the approach of @xcite for the computation of scalar integrals , which are greatly simplified in the large - mass limit , and the method of @xcite to express tensor integrals in terms of scalar ones .",
    "two - point integrals with one heavy propagator have been given in @xcite .",
    "the scalar two - point integral @xmath15 is a function of @xmath5 and @xmath16 . we write it in terms of @xmath17 , @xmath18 with @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "the coefficient of the dimensional regularization pole vanishes when @xmath20 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the real part of the integrand in @xmath15 is parity - odd when @xmath21    the vector two - point integral @xmath22 is given in terms of only one form factor , @xmath23 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the standard one - point scalar integral ( see the appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "the second - rank tensor integral is computed analogously , explicit results being given in @xcite .",

    "the sum extends over @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 this expression for @xmath37 is equivalent to the result given in eq .",

    "these form factors are given by , @xmath42      , \\hspace{3ex }    i_2   =   \\frac{1-\\omega^2}{4\\omega^2 } \\left[(1+\\omega^2 ) f_1 -    ( 1-\\omega^2 ) f_2 \\right ] ~,\\ ] ] with @xmath43 these equations give an explicit expression for @xmath39 . for the sake of brevity , we omit here the results for the tensor integral @xmath44 , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "the scalar three - point integral @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , can be expressed in terms of eight dilogarithms as , @xmath48 the quantities entering these equations are @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is assumed to be real ) , @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and , @xmath54 where in the expression for @xmath55 we denoted @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath8 is a positive constant with dimension of mass , analogous to the mass unit in dimensional regularization .",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath57 does not depend on @xmath8 , it appears there for purely dimensional reasons .",
    "tensor three - point integrals @xmath58 can be given in terms of integrals with smaller ranks and fewer points , by the well - known method of @xcite .",
    "we will consider integrals of standard form @xmath59 in terms of which we can express @xmath57 as , @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . clearly , for the scalar integral we have @xmath63 .    for the vector integral we write @xmath64 , with @xmath65 and similarly @xmath66 .",
