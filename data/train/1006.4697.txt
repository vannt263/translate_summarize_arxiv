    "the theoretical mechanism responsible for the explosion of massive stars has become a multidimensional puzzle when spherical models were ruled out by accurate numerical simulations @xcite . in all mechanisms proposed recently , multidimensional fluid motions are essential for successful explosions of massive stars via core collapse @xcite .",
    "these motions are induced by several hydrodynamic instabilities : convection in the proto - neutron star @xcite , convection in the neutrino heated region between the neutrinosphere and the shock @xcite and the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of a magnetic field on the dynamics has been studied mainly in the context of very rapid rotation . in this case",
    "the magnetic field can be amplified to a dynamically significant strength by the winding of the initial field and by the magneto - rotational instability @xcite .",
    "this magnetic field could then extract enough rotational energy to power an explosion driven by magnetic jets @xcite .    for moderate rotation rates , the magnetic field",
    "is usually neglected because the magnetic pressure is thought to be much smaller than the thermal pressure .",
    "the criterion determining the significance of the magnetic field effects , however , may be more complex .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested that a magnetic field can affect sasi significantly if the alfvn speed is comparable with the advection velocity , which is a much less stringent criterion in the very subsonic part of the flow .",
    "this may explain the surprising stabilization of sasi by a radial magnetic field which pressure is negligibly small ( @xmath1 ) , in the model 2db14am of @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that even in the absence of rotation , the magnetic field could be amplified by the turbulent flow driven by sasi .",
    "this motivates our study of the effect of a moderate magnetic field in the context of negligible rotation , when the alfvn and the fluid velocities are comparable .    the alfvn surface is defined as the surface where the flow velocity equals the alfvn velocity .",
    "such a surface exists in the context of a wind or a jet ejected from a magnetized object ( e.g. the sun ) because the fluid accelerates from a subalfvnic to a superalfvnic speed .",
    "symmetrically in the context of accretion of a magnetized fluid onto a solid object , if the flow is superalfvnic far from the accretor it has to decelerate to a subalfvnic speed before settling down onto the surface .",
    "the fundamental difference between these two situations is that an alfvn wave that is propagating against the flow accumulates at the alfvn surface in a decelerated flow ( as its velocity is decreasing to zero ) , while it diverges from it in an accelerated flow .",
    "this is similar to the hydrodynamical situation at the sonic point : in a decelerated transsonic flow , the accumulation of acoustic waves leads to the formation of a shock wave , while no such thing happens in an accelerated flow .",
    "the formation of a transalfvnic discontinuity was shown to be non evolutionary by @xcite : in the presence of an arbitrarily small perturbation , it instantaneously disintegrates into several other discontinuities .",
    "what happens then at the alfvn surface ?",
    "to our knowledge , the only study dealing with a decelerated transalfvnic flow is that of @xcite .",
    "he showed that alfvn waves not only accumulate but are actually amplified while approaching the alfvn surface in the sense that their energy flux increases .",
    "he proposed that this could cause a broad turbulent zone below the alfvn surface .",
    "such an alfvn surface is expected to exist in the context of core collapse supernovae during the phase of accretion onto the proto - neutron star .",
    "this holds even for a very weak magnetic field ( and thus a very slow alfvn speed ) because the infall velocity vanishes at the center of the star .",
    "furthermore strong alfvn waves are created by sasi @xcite and by the convection inside the proto - neutron star @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to study the evolution of these waves properties as they reach the alfvn surface in the conditions prevailing during the collapse of a massive star core .",
    "@xcite made a linear analysis of high frequency alfvn waves in a cold supersonic and inviscid flow .",
    "we extend his analysis by including the effect of thermal pressure , viscosity , and resistivity , and by considering also the low frequency regime .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the non linear dynamics in a subsonic flow , and show the existence of a non linear pressure feedback . for this purpose",
    "we use a combination of mhd simulations and analytic arguments , which we apply to a model of alfvn surface that is voluntarily as simplified as possible .    in section  2",
    "we describe our set up and our numerical method .",
    "section  3 gives a qualitative description of the simulations , while sections  4 and 5 are devoted to a quantitative description of the amplification of alfvn waves in two different frequency regimes .",
    "the saturation of the alfvn amplification is studied in section  6 .",
    "finally we discuss the astrophysical consequences of our results in section  7 and conclude in section  8 .",
    "in order to study the dynamics of an alfvn surface in a general perspective , we choose to simplify the physical set up as much as possible .",
    "as the phenomena discussed below take place in the vicinity of the alfvn surface , the convergence of the flow is not expected to play a crucial role , hence we restrict our study to a planar geometry .",
    "the perfect gas is described by an adiabatic index @xmath2 characterizing a gas of relativistic degenerate fermions .",
    "cooling processes are neglected for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the alfvn surface in the stationary flow is created through the adiabatic deceleration of a superalfvnic flow to a subalfvnic velocity by an external potential step ( figure  [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "the superalfvnic flow located at @xmath3 has a velocity and a magnetic field that are aligned along the @xmath4 direction ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the external potential is a linear step extending in the region @xmath6 and with a depth chosen in such a way that the alfvn surface is located at @xmath7 .",
    "the incident flow at @xmath3 is denoted with the subscript  in \" ( e.g. the advection velocity @xmath8 , sound speed @xmath9 , and alfvn speed @xmath10 ) , the downstream flow at @xmath11 with the subscript  out \" , and the alfvn surface at @xmath7 with the subscript @xmath12 .",
    "the stationary flow profile is determined by the conservation of energy , mass , magnetic flux and entropy : @xmath13 where the dimensionless entropy @xmath14 is defined by : @xmath15 as a consequence , the sound speed , density and alfvn speed ( defined by @xmath16 ) scale with the advection speed as : @xmath17 the alfvn velocity decreases less than the advection velocity , which allows the superalfvnic fluid to become subalfvnic when compressed by the external potential .",
    "the potential step has the following depth : @xmath18    the free parameters of the stationary flow are thus @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath8 and @xmath21 .",
    "other quantities can be obtained from these ( e.g. @xmath22 ) .      from the upper or the lower boundary , we send either a circularly or a linearly polarized alfvn wave that is propagating against the flow .",
    "the transverse magnetic field and velocity of a circularly polarized wave are described by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are unit vectors along the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions , @xmath28 is the amplitude of the alfvn wave ( it is noted @xmath29 when the alfvn wave is sent from below ) , @xmath30 its frequency and @xmath31 its wave number : @xmath32    in order to generate a symmetric displacement with respect to the initial position , the circularly polarized wave is replaced by a linearly polarized one during the first quarter of a period ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "a linearly polarized alfvn wave is obtained from the same set of equations by retaining only the @xmath26 component of the magnetic field in equation  ( [ dbalfven ] ) .",
    "the circularly polarized alfvn wave is an exact solution of the mhd equations in a uniform flow , in the absence of dissipation , if its amplitude @xmath34 is constant in time and space .",
    "however at the time we start to send the alfvn wave the transition from a zero to a non zero amplitude is not an exact solution , and would create sound waves . to avoid this , we also perturb the density , pressure , and speed of the stationary flow using a second order description of the alfvn wave as is explained in appendix  [ app_alfven ] .      unless otherwise specified , the physical quantities are normalized by setting @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the free parameters of our setup are then : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the resistivity @xmath38 , and the viscosity @xmath39 .",
    "alfvnic perturbations are characterized by their frequency @xmath30 and their amplitude @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 if sent from below ) .",
    "we explored the parameter space by varying the parameters one by one , using the following baseline values : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "we define below a few physical quantities which are important for the dynamics of the alfvn surface and will be useful in the rest of the paper .",
    "the strength of the gradients is described by : @xmath46 it is also a typical growth rate of the alfvn wave amplitude ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "its ratio with the wave frequency defines a dimensionless number @xmath47 that determines whether the wave is in the high frequency regime ( @xmath48 , studied in section  4 ) or in the low frequency regime ( @xmath49 , section  5 ) : @xmath50 the illustrative simulation described in section  3 corresponds to @xmath51 , and has a behavior typical of the high frequency regime .",
    "the ratio of kinematic viscosity @xmath39 to resistivity @xmath38 ( the magnetic prandtl number ) was varied from 0 to infinity , and the same results were found in these two limiting cases . for simplicity , in most of the paper ,",
    "we consider only the effect of resistivity ; however the same results would be obtained with viscosity instead .",
    "as shown in sections  4 and 5 , a typical length scale for the dissipation can be defined as : @xmath52 its ratio with the lengthscale of the gradients is related to the reynolds number : @xmath53 in the simulations presented here the dissipation is varied in the range @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 for our baseline parameters ) .",
    "the core collapse supernovae fluid can be rather viscous inside the neutrinosphere due to neutrino viscosity and is expected to lie in this range of reynolds number ( section  7 ) .",
    "most other astrophysical fluids would be expected to be much less dissipative .",
    "we use the code ramses @xcite to solve the usual mhd equations in one dimension along the @xmath4-direction .",
    "note however that the velocity and magnetic field are three dimensional vectors with non zero components along the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions .",
    "ramses is a second order godunov type code that uses the muscl - hancok scheme to evolve the mhd equations . for the calculations presented in this paper",
    ", we used the minmod slope limiter along with the hlld riemann solver @xcite .",
    "the computational domain is a one dimensional box of length @xmath56 , comprised between @xmath57 and @xmath58 when the alfvn wave is sent from above , and between @xmath59 and @xmath60 when the alfvn wave is sent from below .",
    "after the stationary flow has settled to its numerical equilibrium , we start sending an alfvn wave from either the upper or the lower boundary . for this purpose",
    "we impose in the ghost cells the conditions described by equations  ( [ dbalfven])-([kalfven ] ) and ( [ dp_alfven])-([dvg_alfven ] ) .",
    "we use a zero gradient condition for the other boundary , and checked that the reflections caused by such a choice are negligible ( see section  3 ) .",
    "the dissipation is taken into account explicitly with a kinematic viscosity @xmath39 and a resistivity @xmath38 . for given dissipation coefficients the resolution",
    "is chosen in the range @xmath61 so that the numerical dissipation is significantly smaller than the physical one and does not affect the result : this typically corresponds to @xmath62 .",
    "for the purpose of illustration we first focus on our baseline set of parameters and on the case where the alfvn wave is circularly polarized and sent from above .",
    "the frequency such that @xmath63 makes it representative of the high frequency regime studied more quantitatively in section  4 .",
    "as it approaches the alfvn surface , the alfvn wave is slowed down to a velocity approaching zero , which causes its wavelength to decrease to zero ( figure  [ blines_wkb ] ) . at first , its transverse magnetic field and velocity are amplified to increasingly large values while the transverse displacement stays roughly constant ( figures  [ blines_wkb ] and [ profile_ds_dp ] ) .",
    "the alfvn wave is efficiently damped when the wavelength becomes as small as the dissipative scale , either resistive or viscous .",
    "the resulting amplitude profile of the transverse magnetic field peaks close to the alfvn surface , at a maximum value which we refer to as @xmath64 , and then quickly decreases to zero ( figure  [ profile_ds_dp ] ) .",
    "this enables the establishment of a stationary state , where the amplitude of the alfvn wave is constant in time ( but @xmath65 and @xmath66 are oscillating as the wave is propagating ) .",
    "the dissipation of the alfvn wave is measured at the lower boundary by the change of entropy @xmath67 as compared to the unperturbed flow ( figure  [ profile_ds_dp ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "this amplification and dissipation are explained quantitatively in section  4 for the wkb regime , and in section  5 for the low frequency regime .",
    "the total pressure profile in figure  [ profile_ds_dp ] can be explained by two distinct phenomena .",
    "the negative extremum ( signifying a decrease as compared to the stationary pressure profile ) for @xmath68 is the contribution from the alfvn wave , which amplitude has a similar profile .",
    "the second order expansion of the alfvn wave explained in appendix  [ app_alfven ] gives a good description of the contribution of the alfvn wave to the total pressure ( dashed line in the middle panel of figure  [ profile_ds_dp ] ) .",
    "the second effect is the creation of a pressure feedback propagating up and down , which can be visualized by the difference between the dashed line and the full line .",
    "the amplitude of the feedback sent upward ( respectively downward ) is measured at the upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) boundary by @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( resp .",
    "@xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) . for both signals",
    ", we verified that the relation between the pressure , velocity and density perturbations correspond to what is expected from an acoustic wave propagating either up or down ( equations  [ eqacoustique1]-[eqacoustique2 ] ) .",
    "this gives us confidence that the boundary condition we apply does not cause any spurious reflections .",
    "we find that the pressure feedback increases the pressure and decelerates the flow upstream of the alfvn surface , while it decreases the pressure and decelerates the flow downstream .",
    "this pressure feedback is explained in section  4.4 .",
    "the time evolution of the maximum transverse magnetic field , the pressure feedback , and the entropy creation ( shown in figure  [ time_ds_dp ] ) gives some useful information on the origin of the pressure feedback .",
    "the maximum transverse magnetic field increases from the time the alfvn wave enters the gradients at @xmath75 , until @xmath76 when dissipation becomes important . at this time",
    "the entropy starts to increase and quickly reaches its maximum value for the pressure feedback , and @xmath77 for the entropy . ] . on the other hand",
    "the pressure feedback increases soon after the beginning of the amplification .",
    "this is significantly before the entropy creation starts , indicating that the primary source of this pressure feedback lies in the amplification of the alfvn wave by the gradients rather than in its dissipation .",
    "when the alfvn wave has a much shorter wavelength than the typical scale of the gradients , its evolution can be described in the wkb formalism .",
    "close to the alfvn surface , this approximation is valid if the parameter @xmath47 defined in eq .",
    "( [ defepsilon ] ) satisfies @xmath78 , which corresponds to the high frequency regime .",
    "note that , in the vicinity of the alfvn surface , this parameter @xmath47 does not depend on the distance from the alfvn surface although this may seem counterintuitive as the wavelength decreases to zero @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the lengthscale of variation of its effective propagation velocity also scales like the distance @xmath4 to the alfvn surface .    in the wkb approximation and in the absence of dissipation ,",
    "the wave action of an alfvn wave is conserved ( heuristically this conservation is equivalent to the conservation of wave quanta , see @xcite ) . this property can be used to describe the amplification of the alfvn wave , thus avoiding the lengthy calculations needed for a full wkb approach .",
    "the wave action density is defined by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the energy density and @xmath81 is the frequency in the frame of the fluid : @xmath82 the conservation of the wave action can then be stated as : @xmath83 in a 1d stationary state , the wave action flux is thus constant : @xmath84 the following scaling of the alfvn wave amplitude is obtained : @xmath85 in the absence of dissipation , the amplitude of an incident alfvn wave thus increases to infinity when approaching the alfvn surface .",
    "such a divergence could be expected from a mere accumulation of the wave energy : assuming a constant energy flux and a vanishing propagation speed implies that the amplitude diverges .",
    "what happens to the energy flux of the alfvn wave ?",
    "the relation between the energy density and the action density ( eq .",
    "[ energy_action ] ) shows that as @xmath86 is varied , both quantities can not be conserved at the same time .",
    "when an alfvn wave approaches an alfvn surface , the increase of @xmath87 implies that the energy flux of the alfvn wave also increases @xcite : @xmath88 this shows that the alfvn wave not only accumulates but actually _ amplifies _ when approaching the alfvn surface .",
    "a wave vector can be associated with this amplification of the energy flux : @xmath89 close to the alfvn surface @xmath90 , hence the second term is dominant and may be approximated by : @xmath91    the growth rate that can be associated with the alfvn wave amplification is : @xmath92 thus the steeper the gradient , the faster the amplification .",
    "interestingly , in the idealized case of a compact step , the growth rate would be infinite .      in a uniform flow ,",
    "an alfvn wave obeys the following dispersion relation : @xmath93 for a plane wave ( @xmath30 real ) and small damping rate , the wave vector describing the wave amplitude can be approximated by : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the wave vector in the absence of damping .",
    "the damping vector describing the energy or the wave action is then twice that of the wave amplitude : @xmath96 in the stationary regime , the wave action is then damped as @xcite : @xmath97 this last equation will be used in section  [ exactwkb ] .",
    "the maximum energy flux of the alfvn wave can be estimated by stating that amplification and dissipation compensate exactly : @xmath98 .",
    "using equations  ( [ kamp ] ) and ( [ kdis ] ) , the wave number @xmath99 corresponding to the maximum amplitude can be estimated : @xmath100 where we implicitly assumed that the maximum amplification happens close to the alfvn surface and @xmath101 . in order to make a simple estimate ,",
    "let us assume that the alfvn wave evolves in two steps : the energy flux is amplified without any dissipation in a first step , reaches a maximum @xmath102 , and is instantaneously dissipated in a second step . using equation  ( [ energy_amplification ] ) , the maximum energy flux is then : @xmath103 where the subscript `` in '' refers to the incident alfvn wave and should be replaced by @xmath104 in the case where the alfvn wave is sent from below .",
    "the entropy created by the dissipation of the amplified alfvn wave can be estimated with this maximum energy flux : @xmath105 interestingly the maximum energy flux as well as the created entropy both diverge when the dissipation is decreased to zero , scaling like the square root of the reynolds number .",
    "this suggests a singular behavior and large effects of the alfvn surface in a flow with low dissipation .",
    "the nonlinear saturation of the amplification at low dissipation is studied in section  6 .",
    "a more precise calculation can be done in the regime where all the dissipation takes place close to the alfvn surface , so that the velocity profile can be approximated by a linear function : @xmath106 the damping vector can then be written explicitly as a function of @xmath4 using equation  ( [ kdis2 ] ) : @xmath107 which allows us to solve explicitly equation  ( [ action_dis ] ) : @xmath108 the corresponding transverse magnetic field profile is compared successfully with the simulations in figure  [ amplification ] ( dashed line versus full line ) . in particular , the maximum magnetic field is : @xmath109 using these explicit profiles , the amount of entropy @xmath67 created can be computed with the ohmic dissipation as : @xmath110 which is very close to the simple estimate obtained in equation  ( [ ds_wkb_approx ] ) .",
    "note that in the case of a linearly polarized wave , the above equation should be multiplied by a factor @xmath111 .",
    "@xcite called the phenomenon described in this section an instability because the energy of the perturbation ( the incoming alfvn wave ) increases exponentially .",
    "we prefer to call it an amplification , because it critically depends on the properties of the incident alfvn wave .",
    "for example the maximum amplitude reached is proportional to its amplitude , and if the source of incident alfvn wave is stopped the perturbations gradually disappear ( unless the displacement is kept to a non zero value , see section  5 ) .",
    "thus contrary to usual instabilities , the growth of perturbations at an alfvn surface needs a continuous incident wave and can not grow to non linear amplitude from some small initial perturbations : the non linear saturation studied in section  6 happens only if the incident amplitude is large enough for given dissipation coefficients .      in this subsection",
    "we investigate the origin of the pressure waves that are emitted up and down when the alfvn wave propagates in the gradients . some insight about their physical origin",
    "can be gained by considering the energy budget of the flow . as shown in section  4.1",
    ", the energy flux of an alfvn wave in the wkb regime increases when it approaches the alfvn surface , which implies a coupling with at least another wave in order to ensure energy conservation .",
    "as the wkb criterion precludes a linear coupling , the energy conservation requires a nonlinear coupling which causes a pressure feedback .",
    "figure  [ time_ds_dp ] shows that , after a growth period , the pressure feedback levels off and remains at a constant value , suggesting a non linear coupling to a perturbation at zero frequency .",
    "by contrast a linear process would have retained the frequency of the incident alfvn wave @xmath30 .",
    "as will be shown in the following section , the pressure feedback in the low frequency regime can display a time dependence with a frequency either 0 , @xmath30 or @xmath112 .",
    "the absence of non zero frequencies in the high frequency regime can be interpreted by the presence of many wavelengths in the gradients , which pressure feedbacks interfere destructively .    in order to estimate quantitatively the pressure feedback , we consider the energy and mass budget of the region @xmath6 . in the stationary state where the pressure feedback is constant , the net energy and mass fluxes should vanish : these two equations are sufficient to determine the two unknowns of the problem ( the amplitudes of the acoustic signals propagating up and down ) .",
    "we further assume that the amplification is large , i.e. that the maximum energy flux of the alfvn wave is much larger than the incident energy flux . neglecting the energy flux due to the incident alfvn wave ,",
    "the energy and mass flux perturbations are due to :    \\(i ) the entropy wave , described by : @xmath113    \\(ii ) the acoustic wave propagating up ( termed - ) and down ( termed + ) , described by : @xmath114 the conservation of mass and energy can be written as follows : @xmath115 combining these two equations , the pressure perturbation is obtained as a function of the created entropy : @xmath116 using equation  ( [ ds_wkb ] ) , the pressure feedback can then be expressed as a function of the incident alfvn wave amplitude and the other parameters of the problem .",
    "this analytical result is compared with the simulations in figure  [ couplage ] .",
    "the dependence on the amplitude and frequency of the incident wave , as well as the resistivity and the mach number of the flow are reproduced very well .",
    "a slight discrepancy appears at very high resistivity because the assumption of large amplification is not fulfilled . for incident waves with a large amplitude ,",
    "the amplification saturates when the assumption of linear perturbation breaks down : this non linear regime is further studied in section  6 .",
    "in addition , a different regime appears at low frequency .",
    "this regime is studied in the following section .",
    "in this section we study the low frequency regime , where the wkb criterion is not satisfied : @xmath117 . the flow can be considered as stationary at each instant , because the period of the incident alfvn wave is much longer than the response time of the gradients . with this steady state assumption",
    "an analytical study of this flow becomes possible in the vicinity of the alfvn surface .",
    "as previously , the transverse magnetic field is assumed to be arbitrarily small , and the velocity profile is described by the linear function of equation  ( [ vprofile ] ) . as shown in appendix  [ app_equadiff ] , the transverse magnetic field then follows the second order ordinary differential equation : @xmath118 note that the @xmath27 component follows the same equation .",
    "the solution that does not diverge for large @xmath4 is a gaussian function with a typical width @xmath119 : @xmath120 this suggests that in this regime part of the displacement of the field lines could accumulate in a region of width @xmath119 around the alfvn surface .",
    "this is confirmed by the simulations , as shown in figure  [ blines_lowfreq ] .",
    "the displacement of the field lines induced by this profile can be computed as : @xmath121 the entropy created by this profile is : @xmath122 the relation between the incident alfvn wave amplitude and @xmath64 can then be determined approximately by assuming that the downstream field lines are not perturbed at all .",
    "this amounts to neglecting the downward propagating alfvn wave created by linear coupling of the incident alfvn wave in the gradient , and leads to an error of @xmath123 .",
    "this simple approximation allows to match the transverse displacement of the incident low frequency alfvn wave with that contained in the vicinity of the alfvn surface ( equation  ( [ displacement ] ) ) and deduce the value of @xmath64 .    in order to check the above description ,",
    "let us first consider a circularly polarized alfvn wave which displacement is symmetric with respect to the initial flow .",
    "the displacement of such a wave is constant and equals @xmath124 , giving : @xmath125 figure  [ blines_lowfreq ] compares the corresponding profile ( dashed line ) with the simulations ( full lines ) .",
    "this confirms the gaussian shape and the frequency dependence ( contained in the normalization ) in the low frequency limit .",
    "furthermore figure  [ blines_lowfreq ] shows that a low frequency alfvn wave behaves like a stationary displacement of the field lines ( here induced by sending only half a wavelength of a linearly polarized alfvn wave ) . as shown in figure  [ blines_lowfreq ] however , equation  ( [ bmax_lowfreq ] ) overestimates @xmath64 by @xmath123 .",
    "this can be interpreted by the fact that part of the displacement of the incident wave goes into a downward propagating alfvn wave created by linear coupling in the gradients .",
    "a more elaborate estimate described in appendix  [ app_dbmax ] resolves this slight discrepancy .",
    "the entropy created by this circularly polarized wave is constant and estimated with equations  ( [ ds_displacement ] ) and ( [ bmax_lowfreq ] ) , which can be written in a similar form as equation  ( [ ds_wkb ] ) : @xmath126 this formula is compared successfully with the simulations in figure  [ couplage ] ( left bottom panel ) .    in the case of other alfvn wave polarizations , the displacement of the field lines ( and therefore the entropy created ) can be time dependent",
    ". however the low frequency assumption ensures that this timescale is much longer than the dynamical timescale , such that the oscillation can be considered as a succession of stationary states and the analysis of section 4.4 applies .",
    "the pressure feedback is proportional to the entropy creation ( equations  ( [ dp_sup])-([dp_inf ] ) ) and therefore to the square of the displacement . as a consequence",
    "the time dependence of the pressure feedback can be understood from the time dependence of the displacement .",
    "the trajectory of a field line and the corresponding pressure feedback is illustrated in figure  [ circu_lin_time ] in four different cases .",
    "for a circularly polarized alfvn wave started as described in section  2.2 , the field line describes a circle around its initial position and thus creates a stationary feedback ( i.e. at zero frequency ) .",
    "if the first quarter of a period is omitted ( dashed line ) , it describes an off - centered circle , leading to a displacement and a pressure feedback that oscillates with the same frequency as the incident wave .",
    "similarly , linearly polarized alfvn waves show two different types of time dependence : the centered trajectory leads to an oscillation of the displacement in the range @xmath127 and a pressure feedback with a doubled frequency .",
    "the off - centered trajectory oscillates between @xmath128 , thus the pressure has the same frequency as the incident wave .",
    "the maximum displacement of off - centered waves is twice that of centered waves , leading to a maximum pressure feedback that is approximately four times larger ( figure  [ circu_lin_time ] ) .        in a stationary state ,",
    "the induction and the momentum equations are written ( here , we use a resistivity and no viscosity however the same result would be found if one did the opposite assumption of neglecting the resistivity ) : @xmath232 we linearize the problem by writing : @xmath233 where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the velocity and magnetic field in the @xmath4 direction in the unperturbed flow , while the perturbations @xmath236 and @xmath237 are assumed to be arbitrarily small .",
    "assuming one dimensional perturbations ( no dependence on @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and keeping only the first order perturbations , the @xmath26 component of the induction and momentum equations can be written : @xmath238 which can be combined in one second order differential equation : @xmath239 in the vicinity of the alfvn surface , the profiles can be linearized : @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 . the differential equation",
    "then becomes : @xmath243 which is equivalent to equation  ( [ equadif_lowfreq ] ) .",
    "the velocity perturbation can be obtained from the magnetic field perturbation as : @xmath244      in this subsection we estimate better the amplitude of the magnetic field accumulated at the alfvn surface without neglecting the linear coupling with a downward propagating alfvn wave .",
    "for this purpose we consider the two following conserved quantities : the transverse momentum , and the displacement of the field line . the downward propagating wave and",
    "the displacement accumulated at the alfvn surface should contain the same amount of these quantities as the incident alfvn wave : @xmath245 finally we get : @xmath246 or equivalently : @xmath247 this result is compared successfully with the simulations in figure  [ fig_appendix ] .",
    "when the amplitude of the incident alfvn wave is increased or when the dissipation is decreased , the maximum amplitude of the alfvn wave increases and eventually becomes non linear , and the analysis of the preceding sections no longer applies .",
    "this non linear regime starts when the alfvn wave significantly changes the stationary flow profiles ( e.g. of pressure , density , velocity ) , i.e. when it becomes compressible . in this section",
    "we describe this non linear dynamics and show how it affects the alfvn wave amplification and the creation of the pressure feedback .",
    "to explain the numerical results , we give an approximate analytical description of the saturation , which takes into account the non linearity of the alfvn wave but not of the pressure feedback .",
    "the still higher amplitude regime where the pressure feedback has a significant impact on the flow can not be studied with our numerical set up , because the acoustic wave interacts with the grid boundaries in a non physical way .",
    "the dynamics of an alfvn wave in the linear regime is very similar in the different configurations : whether it is sent from above or from below gives the same amplification and pressure feedback , the only difference between the circular and linear polarization is the time dependence in the low frequency regime . on the contrary ,",
    "the non linear dynamics described in this section differs for these configurations , we thus describe them separately in the next subsections .",
    "the propagation velocity of an alfvn wave non linearly changes as described by @xmath129 in equation  ( [ dvg_alfven ] ) .",
    "thus the propagation velocity of a maximum of transverse magnetic field pressure is different from that of a minimum , leading to a steepening of the wave ( figure  [ profile_up ] ) .",
    "the amplitude above which this steepening happens can be estimated with the criterion that the minimum and the maximum ( separated by one quarter of a wavelength ) have time to catch up before the wave reaches the alfven surface : @xmath130 using equations  ( [ db_amplification ] ) and ( [ vprofile ] ) , one can get the corresponding transverse magnetic field strength for a given incident amplitude : @xmath131    the steepening of the wave damps it efficiently , thus equation  ( [ db_steepen ] ) is a good estimate of the maximum magnetic field reached by a linearly polarized alfvn wave in the non linear regime ( figure  [ saturation_circulin ] , upper panel ) . as in section 4.3.1 , we then use the corresponding maximum flux to estimate the amount of entropy created : @xmath132 this estimate gives the good scaling with @xmath28 but is a factor @xmath133 smaller than the result of the simulations ( figure  [ saturation_circulin ] , lower panel ) .",
    "this is reasonable given the simplicity of the argument .",
    "circularly polarized alfvn waves do not steepen like the linearly polarized ones , because their magnetic pressure does not oscillate over a wavelength . even at non linear amplitude ,",
    "they propagate without deformation in a uniform medium since they are an exact solution of mhd equations . in a non uniform medium however , this is no longer true and the amplification of the alfvn wave creates a gradient of @xmath129 that is non linear ( using equations  ( [ dvg_alfven ] ) and ( [ kamp ] ) ) : @xmath134 this effect is significant if the gradient created by the wave is comparable to the stationary gradient : @xmath135 using equations  ( [ nl_gradient ] ) and ( [ db_amplification ] ) for a given incident amplitude , the corresponding transverse magnetic field strength is obtained : @xmath136 comparing this with the maximum transverse magnetic field in the linear regime ( equation  ( [ dbmax_wkb ] ) ) , gives the threshold of the non linear regime .",
    "the behavior is different if the wave is sent from above or from below .",
    "the gradient created by an alfvn wave sent from above is opposed to the stationary gradient ( because @xmath137 at @xmath138 ) .",
    "therefore it weakens the gradients and pushes the alfvn surface downward , as illustrated in figure  [ profile_up ] .",
    "the weaker gradients lead to a less efficient amplification and pressure feedback ( figures  [ couplage ] and [ saturation_circulin ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the gradient induced by a wave sent from below steepens the stationary gradient ( because @xmath139 at @xmath140 ) .",
    "this causes more amplification which causes more steepening , leading to the build up of a discontinuity ( figure  [ profile_down ] ) . across this discontinuity",
    "the flow is accelerated to a velocity close to ( though somewhat slower than ) the alfvn speed , while the alfvn wave is amplified . just above the threshold ,",
    "the discontinuity is weak and close to the alfvn surface .",
    "as the amplitude is increased , the discontinuity becomes stronger and moves away from the alfvn surface .",
    "contrary to the case of an alfvn wave sent from above this nonlinear effect does not diminish the amplification , thus no saturation occurs for @xmath141 ( figure  [ saturation_baspaquet ] ) . for larger amplitudes",
    "the discontinuity becomes so strong that it reaches the lower grid boundary , leading to non physical effects .",
    "as described in section  5 , a low frequency wave in the linear regime accumulates in a region with a width @xmath119 centered on the alfvn surface . in the non linear regime ,",
    "the magnetic pressure accumulated around the alfvn surface flattens the velocity profile .",
    "eventually the alfvn wave accumulates over a wider region verifying @xmath142 and located downstream of the alfvn surface ( figure  [ profile_down ] ) .",
    "the transverse magnetic field profile can be estimated with the condition @xmath142 : @xmath143 thus using equation  ( [ dvg_alfven ] ) : @xmath144 this profile is compared with a simulation in figure  [ profile_down ] .",
    "the ( relatively small ) discrepancy can be attributed to the effect of the pressure feedback on the velocity profile which was neglected .",
    "the width @xmath145 of the region can be approximated as in section  5 by matching its displacement with that of the incident alfvn wave : @xmath146 thus giving the maximum magnetic field : @xmath147 the entropy created by this profile can be roughly estimated using : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the scale over which @xmath34 varies .",
    "this entropy creation is dominated by the sharp decrease of @xmath34 located near @xmath150 .",
    "the length scale @xmath149 can be roughly estimated assuming that the width of this sharp decrease is due to the dissipative scale .",
    "the width is then such that this diffusion speed due to the resistivity ( typically @xmath151 ) compensates the velocity at which the alfvn wave propagates : @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , we get : @xmath153 finally , using the four previous equations , the entropy created can be expressed as : @xmath154    note that a similar argument in the linear regime gives the same scaling as the more precise calculation of section  5 .",
    "the estimates of the maximum magnetic field and entropy creation are compared successfully with the simulations in figure  [ saturation_baspaquet ] .    while the linear amplification diverges at low dissipation",
    ", it is important to mention that equations  ( [ db_max_lowfreq ] ) and ( [ ds_sat_lowfreq ] ) show that the nonlinear saturated state is independent of the dissipation coefficient .",
    "this is checked with the simulations in figure  [ saturation_eta ] . the same phenomenon was found in section  6.1 for the saturation of linearly polarized waves in the wkb regime ( equations  ( [ db_steepen ] ) and ( [ ds_steepen ] ) ) .",
    "this can be interpreted by the fact that the amplitude at which the alfvn wave is dissipated is controlled by nonlinear effects rather than by the dissipative scale .",
    "we now consider the consequences of an alfvn surface in the context of core collapse supernovae , focusing on the phase of stalled accretion shock when matter from the outer layers of the core accretes on the forming proto - neutron star .",
    "what maximum amplitude do the alfvn waves reach ? can the pressure feedback significantly affect the shock dynamics ? using the analytic formula derived in this paper , we estimate the conditions under which these effects could be significant .",
    "several instabilities cause non radial motions , which can potentially be a source of alfvn waves : both neutrino driven convection and the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) operate between the neutrinosphere and the shock , while ledoux convection takes place below the neutrinosphere .",
    "powerful alfvn waves could also be created by the g - modes of the pns if these are excited to large amplitudes as suggested by @xcite .",
    "below we estimate the typical amplitude and frequency of the alfvn waves created by these three phenomena .",
    "sasi in a magnetized flow was studied linearly by @xcite .",
    "although sasi can be stabilized by a radial field , this stabilization effect is expected to be less acute if the field is oblique , since the horizontal component can enhance the growth of sasi .",
    "@xcite showed that the vorticity created by the shock oscillations is distributed into slow and alfvn waves .",
    "the proportion of these two types of waves depends on the field geometry and the wave vector of the sasi mode . except for very particular cases ( for example in a purely radial magnetic field ,",
    "only slow waves are created ) one can expect that a significant fraction of the vorticity is in the form of alfvn waves .",
    "furthermore , downward and upward propagating alfvn waves are created with roughly the same amplitude ( strictly in the weak field limit ) . as a first estimate",
    "we will thus assume that the amplitude of the upward propagating alfvn wave of interest for the alfvn surface is a few times smaller than the maximum transverse velocities induced by sasi . according to published numerical simulations , the deformations of the shock induce transverse motions with a speed comparable to or even greater than the sound speed @xcite .",
    "it is thus reasonable to take an amplitude of @xmath155 , which corresponds to @xmath156 .",
    "the oscillation period of sasi is determined by the advection time from the shock to a radius of strong deceleration slightly above the neutrinosphere @xcite , and is usually in the range : @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the production of alfvn waves by ledoux convection in the proto - neutron star was considered by @xcite .",
    "the wave amplitude may be estimated by the typical velocities in the pns convection : @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "the period may be roughly estimated with the overturn time of a convection cell with a size @xmath160 : @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "@xcite witnessed powerful g - mode oscillations that had a typical period of @xmath163 and a displacement amplitude of @xmath164 .",
    "the alfvn waves created by these oscillations may be estimated to have similar amplitude and frequency : @xmath165 .",
    "however one should note that such large amplitudes are still controversial since they have not yet been confirmed by other groups @xcite .",
    "furthermore @xcite suggested that non linear coupling with short wavelength modes unresolved in the simulations could saturate this g - mode at a much lower amplitude .",
    "the timescale of the alfvn wave amplification and pressure feedback is controlled by the stiffness of the velocity gradient : @xmath169 where @xmath19 is the typical size of the gradient and @xmath170 a typical advection speed .",
    "this timescale depends crucially on the radius of the alfvn surface .",
    "if the alfvn surface is inside the proto - neutron star , the advection speed due to the contraction of the pns is very slow and the timescale could become too long to affect the dynamics of the supernova explosion",
    ".    the situation would be more favorable if the alfvn surface lies outside the pns .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the velocity gradient peaks at a radius slightly above the neutrinosphere and reaches values of @xmath171 ( their figure  14 ) .",
    "this translates into a quite fast growth timescale : @xmath172 .",
    "this timescale , associated to the advection time across the deceleration layer with a size @xmath173 , is significantly shorter than the period of sasi , which corresponds to the advection time from the shock to the pns surface on a distance of @xmath174 . as a consequence",
    ", sasi - created alfvn waves would lie marginally in the low frequency regime ( @xmath175 ) , while those originating from the pns convection would lie in the wkb regime ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "we conclude that the alfvn wave amplification can be faster than other dynamical timescales , if the alfvn surface lies in the strong gradients slightly above the neutrinosphere . in the next subsection",
    ", we discuss whether this corresponds to a realistic magnetic field strength .      because the infall velocity decreases to zero at the center of the proto - neutron star",
    ", an alfvn surface should be present in the flow regardless of the magnetic field strength",
    ". however , its consequences and their significance for core collapse supernovae depends on the alfvn surface radius .",
    "this radius is controlled by the magnetic field strength , which is unfortunately extremely uncertain .",
    "a very weak magnetic field would place the alfvn surface close to the center inside the proto - neutron star , while stronger field would move it outward to larger radii where the infall velocity is larger .    as discussed in the previous subsection",
    ", if the alfvn surface is inside the pns the amplification timescale may be too long to affect the dynamics before an explosion sets in .",
    "therefore we concentrate on the possibility that the alfvn surface lies above the pns surface .",
    "what strength of the magnetic field is required for this to happen ? assuming an advection speed of @xmath177 and a density of @xmath178 , yields a magnetic field at the alfvn surface of @xmath179 .",
    "compared with other supernovae studies , this corresponds to an intermediate strength . indeed",
    ", magnetic models of supernovae explosions often find or assume a much stronger field of @xmath180 with a magnetic pressure comparable to the thermal pressure @xcite , while here the magnetic pressure remains much smaller than the thermal one : @xmath181 .",
    "on the other hand , this magnetic field strength is significantly larger than the extrapolation from the stellar evolution calculation of @xcite .    in order to get an idea of the plausibility of such a field ,",
    "it is instructive to estimate the magnetic field of the resulting neutron star and to compare it with observed values of pulsars and magnetars . assuming that the magnetic flux is conserved ( with either the usual prescription @xmath182 , or @xmath183 for a radial field ) and extrapolating the magnetic field at the alfvn surface to the final density and radius of a cool neutron star ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 ) yields @xmath186 .",
    "while this is much larger than usual pulsars , it corresponds to the range of magnetic field strength typical of magnetars .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the alfvn surface may play an important role in supernovae leaving a magnetar behind , but should not be significant in the more common supernovae forming normal pulsars .",
    "one should however keep in mind that the correspondence between the magnetic field of the pns and that of much older neutron stars is very uncertain , because the magnetic field might decrease during the supernovae explosion and later evolution , as hypothesized by @xcite . if this were the case",
    ", magnetic effects would play a role in a larger subset of supernovae .",
    "we should also caution that our description of the alfvn surface dynamics applies only if the magnetic field comes from the progenitor star @xcite , and not if created in situ by a dynamo or the tapping of the rotational energy of the pns @xcite .",
    "@xcite also studied the effect of alfvn waves on the dynamics of core collapse supernovae .",
    "they assumed a magnetic field of @xmath187 at the surface of the proto - neutron star ( @xmath188 ) , which is one to two orders of magnitude larger than considered in this paper .",
    "as a consequence , their alfvn surface lies in the supersonic flow above the shock , while we restricted our study to the case where the alfvn surface is in the subsonic part of the flow .      in the linear regime , the maximum amplification and the pressure feedback critically depend on the dissipation scale ( due to viscosity or resistivity ) .",
    "however , the large amplitude of the incident alfvn wave would probably place it in the non linear regime discussed in section  6 , in which the dynamics is independent of the dissipation coefficient",
    ". therefore the dissipation should not play an important role unless it is much larger than considered in this paper ; we check below that this is not the case .",
    "the hot nuclear fluid constituting the proto - neutron star is an extremely good conductor but is rather viscous due to the diffusion of neutrinos ( resulting in a huge magnetic prandtl number @xmath189 , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the dominant diffusion therefore comes from the neutrino viscosity , which can be estimated in the region optically thick to neutrinos using the diffusion limit ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath190 , slightly below the neutrinosphere where it is highest .",
    "this translates into a dissipation scale @xmath191 and a typical reynolds number @xmath192 ( using @xmath193 , @xmath194 as suggested in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "this value is in the range explored in this paper and yields a significant amplification of an alfvn wave before it is dissipated .",
    "the steep gradients proposed to be a good place for a strong effect of the alfvn surface lie _ above _ the neutrinosphere . there",
    ", the matter is optically thin to neutrinos and this neutrino viscosity is unfortunately not well defined .",
    "however , interactions with streaming neutrinos still have a similar damping effect , which was estimated by @xcite by a damping rate @xmath195 . as",
    "this is smaller than the growth rate of the amplification , we do not expect the neutrinos to be able to prevent the amplification very efficiently .      in order to get a simpler scaling of the pressure feedback , we assume that at the alfvn surface , the flow is very subsonic , that is : @xmath196 .",
    "equation  ( [ dp_sup ] ) giving the pressure feedback propagating toward the shock then simplifies into : @xmath197    since alfvn waves created by convection and g - modes in the proto - neutron star lie in the wkb regime , we use the formulation of section  6.1 . under the same assumptions ,",
    "equation  ( [ ds_steepen ] ) simplifies into : @xmath198 this gives @xmath199 for pns convection ( using the values : @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 ) and @xmath203 for g - modes ( using @xmath204 ) .",
    "the alfvn waves created by sasi lie marginally in the low frequency regime , therefore we use the nonlinear formulation developed in section  6.3 .",
    "equation  ( [ ds_sat_lowfreq ] ) simplifies into : @xmath205 the values @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 give a very significant pressure feedback : @xmath209 .",
    "the corresponding maximum transverse magnetic field can be estimated with equation  ( [ db_max_lowfreq ] ) : @xmath210 yielding @xmath211 .",
    "of course this very large value of the pressure feedback should not be taken at face value , since our analysis assumes that the pressure feedback does not significantly modify the upstream flow .",
    "a self consistent calculation should consider the shock as the source of alfvn waves in order to capture the effect of the pressure feedback on the alfvn wave injection .",
    "we also caution that such a large pressure feedback corresponds to maximum values of the transverse magnetic field with a pressure comparable to the thermal pressure , i.e. much greater than the longitudinal field .",
    "whether this can really happen should be checked further in particular with multidimensional simulations , which might show a different dynamics that could saturate the amplification earlier that in 1d .",
    "we conclude that if the alfvn surface lies in the strong gradients above the neutrinosphere , the amplification of the alfvn waves created by sasi generates a significant pressure feedback .",
    "sasi is more efficient than the pns convection and g - modes because its alfvn waves have a larger amplitude and a lower frequency .",
    "a linear acoustic feedback is known to exist in the advective - acoustic cycle , which is believed to be the mechanism driving sasi @xcite .",
    "by contrast , this new pressure feedback comes from a non linear coupling . as a consequence ,",
    "it is potentially important only in the non linear phase of sasi .",
    "also the frequency is not necessarily the same as that of sasi , but has fourrier components at the frequencies @xmath12 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "more importantly , instead of oscillating between negative and positive values @xmath214 is here _",
    "always positive_. it is thus expected to be always pushing the shock outwards .      for the processes described in this paper to have a significant impact on the dynamics , the alfvn waves should have access to an appropriate source of energy . as argued in section  7.1 , a fraction of the kinetic energy of sasi and pns convection could be tapped .",
    "if this were the only source of energy , these alfvn waves would probably remain subdominant .",
    "however , as shown in section  4 , the energy flux of alfvn waves increases as it approaches the alfvn surface . during this amplification",
    "they thus extract an additional energy from the stationary flow .",
    "the stationary flow is potentially a much greater energy reservoir than the kinetic energy , if the thermal or the gravitational energy can be tapped .",
    "an important question is thus whether the alfvn waves can extract a significant fraction of the thermal energy or if it is limited to the kinetic energy .",
    "this depends on the nonlinear saturation of their amplification . in section  6",
    "we found that the amplification stops roughly when the magnetic pressure is comparable to the thermal pressure , which suggests that the energy of the alfvn waves can become comparable to the thermal energy .",
    "one should note however that our simulations were limited to a regime of parameters where the kinetic and thermal energies are comparable .",
    "additional simulations are needed to address this point .",
    "* a small amplitude alfvn wave propagating toward an alfvn surface is amplified until its wavelength is as small as the dissipative scale @xmath215 .",
    "the timescale for this amplification depends on the stiffness of the gradient : @xmath216 .",
    "* the amplification of the alfvn wave creates a pressure feedback that increases the upstream pressure through a non linear coupling .",
    "this pressure feedback is stationary for a high frequency incident wave , while for a low frequency wave it can also display a time dependence with either the same frequency or twice the frequency of the incident wave .",
    "* the subsequent dissipation of the amplified alfvn wave leads to an entropy creation , which can be related to the efficiency of the pressure feedback : @xmath217 ( in a very subsonic flow ) .",
    "* in the linear regime , the smaller the viscosity / resistivity , the more efficient the amplification and the consequent coupling because the dissipation happens later on ( i.e. at smaller scale ) .",
    "the relevant quantities ( maximum amplitude , pressure feedback , entropy created etc ... ) scale as @xmath218 , and could thus be very large in a weakly dissipative flow .",
    "* at large amplitude of the incident wave or at low dissipation , the amplified alfvn wave becomes non linear and affects the background flow .",
    "a linearly polarized wave then steepens , which leads to its efficient dissipation and therefore to the saturation of the amplification . in the low frequency regime , the nonlinear saturation",
    "is mediated by the flattening of the velocity profile in the vicinity of the alfvn surface . * in this nonlinear saturated regime , the dynamics becomes independent of the dissipation coefficients , because the amplitude at which the alfvn wave is dissipated is controlled by nonlinear effects rather than by the dissipative scale .",
    "* powerful alfvn waves can be created by the proto - neutron star convection , the g - mode oscillations and the sasi induced shock oscillations . *",
    "the amplification of these waves near the alfvn surface can be fast enough to affect the dynamics , if the magnetic field is strong enough to place this surface in the region of strong deceleration just above the neutrinosphere .",
    "assuming magnetic flux conservation , this would correspond to the formation of a magnetar . * in this case , the pressure feedback is dominated by the sasi created alfvn waves , and could contribute significantly to the pressure below the shock .",
    "the magnetic field could be amplified to a strength of @xmath219 .",
    "the additional pressure can be expected to push the shock to larger radius , which might be favorable for the success of a potential neutrino driven explosion .",
    "our setup is voluntarily chosen as simplified as possible in order to show the physical processes at work in their simplest form and to render analytical work tractable .",
    "because of its simplicity , our analysis suffers from the following major limitations :    * we restricted our study to a one dimensional geometry .",
    "it is possible that multidimensional phenomena neglected here stop the amplification of alfvn waves at a somewhat lower amplitude than in one dimension .",
    "multidimensional processes that could dissipate alfvn waves include phase mixing @xcite , nonlinear multi - wave interactions which lead to a turbulent cascade @xcite , and parametric decay instability @xcite .",
    "this last process can in principle also happen in one dimension , although we did not see any evidence for it in our simulations .",
    "* the magnetic field was assumed to be parallel to the advection velocity , which is a very singular situation ( for example , no alfvn discontinuity , even non evolutionary , is possible under these circumstances ) .",
    "this might be expected in a very subalfvnic flow where the field lines are able to force the gas to follow them , however there is no reason why this should also be the case in the superalfvnic flow .",
    "* incident alfvn waves were imposed at the boundary condition , without specifying how they were created .",
    "strictly speaking , sasi can not be invoked in the oversimplified field geometry assumed , because sasi would create only slow waves but no alfvn waves .",
    "alfvn waves would be generated by sasi only if the field were oblique .",
    "* we studied only the behavior of pure sinusoidal waves , which are meant to model sasi induced oscillations .",
    "this approach is a crude approximation since the flow is known to be turbulent .",
    "the interaction of such a flow with the alfvn surface should be the subject of future multidimensional simulations .",
    "* we used a simple adiabatic equation of state .",
    "neglecting the cooling by neutrinos renders our stationary pressure profile unrealistic .",
    "* we assumed a planar geometry .",
    "while this is justified in the vicinity of the alfvn surface ( where most of the dynamics takes place ) , the convergence should be taken into account for a self consistent description from the source of alfvn waves to their amplification .",
    "* we assumed a large scale magnetic field that connects the region of emission and the alfvn surface .",
    "these two regions may be magnetically disconnected if the field is turbulent @xcite . *",
    "last but not least , we took as a free parameter the strength of the background magnetic field without explaining its origin .",
    "we thus implicitly assumed the field to originate from the progenitor star , and our results directly apply only in this scenario .",
    "the magnetic field already present in the collapsing core might or might not be sufficiently strong to place the alfvn surface above the neutrinosphere . if it is not strong enough , it could still be amplified in situ by the mri @xcite or by a dynamo process @xcite , but the extension of such a field beyond the alfvn surface is uncertain .",
    "a realistic description of the alfvn surface dynamics will therefore require further investigation , in particular through multidimensional simulations .",
    "one of the remaining questions concerns the behavior of slow waves , which were not present in the set up studied in this paper . in a high beta plasma (",
    "in which the sound speed is significantly larger than the alfvn speed ) slow waves bear some similarities with alfvn waves , thus they may be expected to behave in a similar way .",
    "as their propagation speed is somewhat slower than the alfvn speed , the surface where they would accumulate should be somewhat beneath the alfvn surface .",
    "because their group and phase velocity depend on their transverse structure , we could expect the region where they accumulate to be broader than in the case of alfvn waves .",
    "based on the fact that the amplification of alfvn waves extracts energy from the stationary flow , @xcite proposed that a broad turbulent zone would be created below the alfvn surface .",
    "our analysis suggests instead that the amplification of alfvn waves energy flux creates an acoustic feedback propagating up and down rather than a turbulent zone .",
    "in addition to the inability of our one dimensional analysis to describe turbulence , the difference may be attributed to the fact that we study a subsonic alfvn surface while @xcite studied a cold supersonic plasma , in which no upstream acoustic feedback is possible .    finally , we note that an alfvn surface could also exist in an accretion flow onto a magnetic object such as t - tauri stars , magnetic white dwarfs or neutron stars",
    ". the dynamics may however be different in these contexts especially if the alfvn surface lies in a supersonic flow .",
    "the possibility suggested by @xcite that turbulence could play a role in these situations deserves further investigations .",
    "the authors are grateful to jean - jacques aly , romain teyssier , and christopher thompson for insightful discussions , as well as to the anonymous referee whose report helped improve the discussion .",
    "this work has been partially funded by the vortexplosion project anr-06-jcjc-0119 .",
    "in the linear regime , an alfvn wave perturbs the velocity and the magnetic field perpendicular to the stationary magnetic field as described in equations  ( [ dbalfven])-([kalfven ] ) . on the other hand",
    "the perturbations of pressure , density , and longitudinal velocity and magnetic field are zero to first order .",
    "this is no longer true in the non linear regime where the alfvn wave becomes compressible .",
    "we estimate this with a second order development , where we take into account terms scaling like @xmath220 and @xmath221 but neglect all higher order terms .",
    "the second order perturbation of a variable @xmath222 is denoted by @xmath223 , thus the background stationary flow is perturbed in the following manner : @xmath224 , @xmath225 etc ... we then consider the conservation of magnetic flux , entropy , mass and energy at the interface between an unperturbed region and a region containing the alfvn wave .",
    "this interface is moving with respect to the observer frame at the propagation speed of the alfvn wave @xmath226 .",

    "<S> , the amplification continues until the alfvn wavelength becomes as small as the dissipative scale . </S>",
    "<S> a pressure feedback that increases the pressure in the upstream flow is created via a non linear coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytic formulae for the maximum amplification and the non linear coupling and check them with numerical simulations to a very good accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , these quantities diverge if the dissipation is decreased to zero , scaling like the square root of the reynolds number , suggesting large effects in weakly dissipative flows . </S>",
    "<S> we also characterize the non linear saturation of this amplification when compression effects become important , leading to either a change of the velocity gradient , or a steepening of the alfvn wave .    applying these results to core </S>",
    "<S> collapse supernovae shows that the amplification can be fast enough to affect the dynamics , if the magnetic field is strong enough for the alfvn surface to lie in the region of strong velocity gradient just above the neutrinosphere . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the presence of a strong magnetic field in the progenitor star , which would correspond to the formation of a magnetar under the assumption of magnetic flux conservation . </S>",
    "<S> an extrapolation of our analytic formula ( taking into account the nonlinear saturation ) suggests that the alfvn wave could reach an amplitude of @xmath0 , and that the pressure feedback could significantly contribute to the pressure below the shock . </S>"
