    "the study of superconductivity has a long history . for the conventional superconductors ,",
    "the mechanism has been successfully explained by the bcs theory@xcite , that the electron - phonon ( @xmath2-ph ) interaction is at the central stage . for the high-@xmath3 superconductors , however ,",
    "the mechanisms is still not clear with a number of basic questions need further investigation . in order to clarify these problems ,",
    "enduring efforts have been made for two decades by the experimentalists and theorists .    in the experimental aspect , since the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) directly measures the electronic occupied states in a crystal , it has become one of the most important experimental techniques to study the electronic properties of superconductors . nowadays , with the great improvement of energy resolution , arpes is able to observe the fine structures due to @xmath2-ph interaction@xcite and the tiny superconducting gap@xcite with an energy resolution less than 1 mev .",
    "recently , the oxygen isotope effect has been studied with arpes on the high-@xmath4 superconductor bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi2212 ) by two groups@xcite . comparing their data ,",
    "at least one common feature has become clear , the spectra are shifted when @xmath5o is substituted by its isotope @xmath6o , whose movement in this crystal is regarded as a lattice vibration , i.e. , phonon .",
    "this isotope induced band shift indicates that the @xmath2-ph interaction has an effect on the electrons , hence providing direct evidence for the interplay between electrons and phonons in this material .    since the first report by gweon _",
    "et al._@xcite , the isotopic band shift has become an controversial issue and gained considerable interest@xcite , as the observed band shift is up to 40 mev , much larger than the maximum isotopic energy change of phonon ( @xmath7 5 mev ) according to the measured vibration energies of oxygen@xcite .",
    "in addition to this large ration of band shift versus phonon energy change , the presence of both positive and negative band shifts in the arpes also implies that the electrons and phonons are coupled in a complicated manner .",
    "very recently , douglas _",
    "et al._@xcite repeat the experiment and find the shift is only 2@xmath83 mev , which is inconsistent with the large shift found by gweon _",
    "et al._@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we look into the @xmath2-ph interaction in bi2212 and its relation with arpes by the hartree - fork and quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite methods .",
    "our purpose here is to figure out whether the isotope - associated anomalies , especially the large ratio of band shift versus phonon energy change , are possible at all from a theoretical point of view .",
    "we will show that the abovementioned band shift can be explained within a scenario of phonon softening effect driven by the @xmath2-ph coupling , while the positive - negative sign change is due to a momentum dependence of the coupling .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we put forward the model hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "3 , an investigation on this model with hartree - fork theory is conducted . in sec . 4",
    ", we show the numerical results of hartree - fork and qmc methods , and discuss the origin of band shift .",
    "our conclusion is presented in sec .",
    "in the theoretical aspect , to investigate the effect of lattice vibration on the electrons , two kinds of @xmath2-ph interaction are usually modeled for cuprates , i.e. , diagonal and non - diagonal couplings@xcite .",
    "the former is a correlation between the phonons and intra - site electron density@xcite , and the latter is between the phonons and inter - site chemical bond@xcite . in the cuo@xmath0 plane of cuprates , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , when an electron is hopping from one copper atom to another , its movement is strongly affected by the vibration of oxygen atoms between the initial and final sites@xcite .",
    "this kind of interaction thus turns out to be an off - diagonal type coupling , which modulates the electronic band structure . in this sense , the off - diagonal @xmath2-ph coupling is crucial to the aforementioned isotope - induced band shift .    in this work , since we are primarily concerned with the effect of band shift , we start from the following model hamiltonian ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 throughout this paper ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath14 at the cu site @xmath15 on a square lattice .",
    "@xmath16 is the electronic transfer energy between two cu sites @xmath15 and @xmath17 , and @xmath18 enumerates the @xmath19th ( @xmath19=1 or 2 in this work ) nearest neighboring cu sites , which is accessible from site @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath20 is the chemical potential , defining the total electron number in this system .",
    "the oxygen phonon is assumed to be of the einstein type with a frequency @xmath21 and a mass @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the mass change factor of phonon due to the isotope substitution . in the third term",
    ", @xmath25 is the dimensionless coordinate operator of the oxygen phonon located between the nearest - neighboring cu sites @xmath15 and @xmath26 , and the sum denoted by @xmath27 just means a summation over all the phonon sites in the lattice .",
    "conduction plane in cuprates .",
    "the copper atoms ( black circles ) form a simple square lattice , and the oxygen atoms ( white circles ) are located between the nearest - neighboring cu sites . ]    in the conduction plane of cuo@xmath0 , the electronic hopping integral @xmath28 can be expanded to the second order terms with respect to the phonon displacements .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "1 , the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath29 and the second - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath30 can be expanded as , @xmath31 here we note that the linear @xmath2-ph coupling does not appear in the expansion owing to the lattice symmetry of present model . therefore ,",
    "if we consider the hopping up to the second nearest neighbors , hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be rewritten as , @xmath32    \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mbox{\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ } \\times ( a^{\\dag}_{l , \\sigma } a_{l + \\delta_2 , \\sigma }    + a^{\\dag}_{l + \\delta_2 , \\sigma } a_{l",

    "here we want to stress that by using this model , we have assumed the anti - ferromagnetic ordering is established as a background .",
    "accordingly , the double occupancy does not occur and the on - site coulomb repulsion between the electrons is omitted .",
    "mean while , the inter - site electron - electron interaction is partially included in the screened values of @xmath39 s and @xmath40 s .",
    "in order to have an insight in the effect of quadratic @xmath2-ph coupling , we first study the model hamiltonian ( 4 ) via a hartree - fork treatment . by applying the hartree - fork approximation ( hfa ) , @xmath41 we can separate the @xmath2-ph coupled term in eq .

    "this anisotropy can give rise to the above - mentioned sign reverse of the isotope effect .",
    "we shall return to this point in the next section .",
    "since the @xmath2-ph coupling is in a quadratic manner , the phonon wave function retains a gaussian form , and we assume it to be @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a coefficient to be determined by the variation method . by using the gaussian integral formula , @xmath58 we have @xmath59 and the phonon energy @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is @xmath62 minimizing the phonon zero point energy of eq . (",
    "20 ) with respect to @xmath57 , the coefficient @xmath57 is finally determined as @xmath63 { ( 1 - \\gamma ) \\lambda } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting eq .",
    "( 21 ) into eq .",
    "( 18 ) , the phonon spatial variation is found to be @xmath64 thus , within the hfa , we can self - consistently determine the isotopic band shift in terms of eqs .",
    "( 9 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 22 ) .    in terms of eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 21 ) , the phonon energy becomes @xmath65 where , @xmath66 is the effective phonon energy renormalized by @xmath45 , which means the phonon is softened when the @xmath2-ph coupling is switched on .",
    "this phonon softening effect is not due to the photoemission or isotope replacement , but the intrinsic @xmath2-ph coupling which is in the quadratic manner .",
    "here we want to stress that the bare phonon energy @xmath21 is not an experimental observable , meanwhile the effective one @xmath67 can be detected by the raman spectroscopy .",
    "we now introduce the isotopic phonon energy change as @xmath68 from eqs .",
    "( 12 ) , ( 22 ) and ( 26 ) , we find the ratio @xmath69 can be represented as @xmath70 which is only subject to the @xmath2-ph coupling . in this sense",
    ", @xmath69 can be regarded as a quantity indicative of the strength of @xmath2-ph coupling and the degree of phonon softening in the @xmath2-ph system .",
    "as mentioned above , the most intriguing behavior of the isotope effect is associated with the ratio @xmath69 .",
    "we shall focus on this ratio in the present section .    in order to compare the hfa results with the exact calculation",
    ", we employ the qmc method@xcite in this work . starting from hamiltonian ( 4 ) , we first calculate the spectral function @xmath71 , and then determine @xmath47 by the moment analysis of the spectral function as , @xmath72 in qmc",
    ", the temperature is set at @xmath73=0.05 .",
    "since this simulation suffers from the random error , in the numerical calculation we impose a large isotopic mass enhancement to suppress the fluctuation , i.e. , from @xmath74=1 to @xmath23=2 .",
    "it should be noted here , although this mass variation is larger than the @xmath5o/@xmath6o substitution , it actually has no effect on the ratio @xmath69 , which is mass - independent , as shown in eq .",
    "( 27 ) .        in ref .",
    "16 , five tight binding parameters are suggested for a best agreement with the experimental band structure and fermi surface of bi2212 . while , in this work , since we are interested in the mechanism of band shift , we restrict our discussion in a case with only nearest- and second - nearest - hopping effects , and thus introduce two tight binding parameters , i.e. , the bare electronic transfer energies @xmath33 and @xmath34 . to reproduce the band structure and fermi surface",
    ", we set @xmath33=0.22 ev and make it the unit of energy for the numerical calculation . in the unit of @xmath33 , we assume @xmath34=-0.2 , and the chemical potential @xmath20=-1 which is invariant with the isotope substitution . the bare phonon energy is set as @xmath21=1.0 , and the two @xmath2-ph coupling constants are fixed at a ratio of @xmath35:@xmath36=1:-1 , for simplicity . in fig .",
    "2 , we plot the electronic dispersion relation ( solid curve ) along the symmetry line @xmath75-@xmath76-@xmath77 of the brillouin zone below the fermi energy ( @xmath78 ) , when @xmath35=0.05 and @xmath23=1 .",
    "the fermi surface of this case is also shown in the inset . by comparing with the results of ref .",

    "we see both theories figure out an increase of @xmath69 with @xmath35 , which means if the @xmath2-ph coupling is strong enough , a small change of phonon energy @xmath84 can be amplified to a large band shift @xmath50 in arpes .    in fig .",
    "4 , we show the origin of this anomalously large band shift is the phonon softening driven by the aforementioned quadratic @xmath2-ph coupling . in panel",
    "( a ) , the ratio @xmath85 is plotted as a function of the quadratic coupling constant @xmath35 .",
    "both hfa ( solid lines ) and qmc ( filled circles ) show that @xmath85 declines monotonically with the increase of @xmath35 . together with this softening of phonon energy , the phonon spatial variation @xmath80 due to the isotope substitution increases gradually [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "this finally leads to a large band shift , as manifested in eq .",
    "( 12 ) .    in eq .",
    "( 12 ) as well as eq . ( 27 ) , it is implied that the band shift has a momentum dependence , which may result in an anisotropy of the isotope effect , and a positive - negative sign change of the ratio @xmath69 . as an example",
    ", we show this sign reverse in fig .",
    "3 , where panels ( a ) and ( b ) are for @xmath69 at the @xmath76 and @xmath75 points , respectively .",
    "because of the size limitation of qmc , we do not have much data for a continuous dispersion along the @xmath86 direction .",
    "nevertheless , in fig .",
    "3 , both theories clearly show that the isotope substitution yields a positive band shift at the @xmath76 point , and a negative one at the @xmath75 point .",
    "thus , one can see the sign reverse of the isotope effect is a natural consequence of the momentum dependence of the @xmath2-ph coupling .    in figs . 3 and 4 ,",
    "although at larger @xmath35 , some deviation between the hfa and qmc arises , the overall tendencies are in a good agreement , demonstrating that the strong off - diagonal quadratic @xmath2-ph coupling is responsible for the large isotopic band shift .    before closing this section , it is worth noting that the latest experiment by douglas _",
    "et al._@xcite has suggested that the unusual isotope effect observed by gweon _",
    "et al._@xcite might be an alignment error of the sample .",
    "in contrast to the 10 - 40 mev band shift reported in ref .",
    "4 , new data show the shift is only 2@xmath83 mev.@xcite if this is the case , it should be clear that the off - diagonal quadratic @xmath2-ph coupling investigated in this work can not be very strong for the cuprates .",
    "in conclusion , by using the hfa and qmc , we study the isotope effect of bi2212 based on an off - diagonal @xmath2-ph model , where the electrons and phonons are coupled in a quadratic form .",
    "the hfa enables us to capture the essence of present problem , and qmc provides us the exact results with which the hfa results can be compared .",
    "our calculation demonstrates that the isotope - induced band shift of arpes can be well described by the model with an off - diagonal quadratic @xmath2-ph coupling .",
    "we ascribe the large value of @xmath69 to the phonon softening triggered by the quadratic @xmath2-ph coupling . while the positive - negative sign change is connected to a momentum dependence of the coupling . comparing the results of hfa and qmc",
