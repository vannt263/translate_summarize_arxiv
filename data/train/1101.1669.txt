    "over the last couple of years there has been a growing interest in studying of the connections between the one - dimensional driven - diffusive systems and the two - dimensional walk models @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a properly defined steady - state normalization factor , called the partition function , of some of the one - dimensional driven - diffusive systems with open boundaries obtained using a matrix product method ( reader can see @xcite for a review ) is equal to the partition function of a two - dimensional walk model obtained using a transfer matrix method @xcite . + it is known that the one - dimensional driven - diffusive systems exhibit a variety of interesting critical behaviors , such as non - equilibrium phase transition and real - space condensation , by changing their microscopic reaction rates . in @xcite the authors have shown that the phase transitions in the steady - state of non - equilibrium systems can be investigated and classified using the lee - yang theory of phase transitions . the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is known as the simplest system among the one - dimensional driven - diffusive systems @xcite . in an inhomogeneous version of this process ( also known as the asep in the presence of the impurities or second class particles ) the particles hop in a preferred direction with different hopping rates on a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that there is an exact mapping from this process to a zero - range process in which the particles behave like bosons and the steady - state is a product measure @xcite .",
    "the zero - range process was first introduced into the mathematical literature as an example of interacting markov processes . by fine - tuning of the microscopic hopping rates ,",
    "a finite fraction of a system s mass can accumulate within a microscopic region of the system .",
    "this can be thought of as a traffic jam . in an equivalent zero - range process",
    ", it turns out that the average number of the particles at a single lattice site in this phase can be of order of the system size .",
    "this is in contrast to the exclusion process where each lattice site can be only occupied by a single particle .",
    "the condensation in this phase reminds us of real - space bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "+ in recent years , different types of walk models have been introduced where some of these models can describe physical phenomena such as polymer phase transitions .",
    "some examples are given in @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , two - dimensional versions of these models have been adopted to describe non - equilibrium phase transition in one - dimensional driven - diffusive systems with open boundaries .",
    "to the best of our knowledge the walk models , counterpart of the one - dimensional driven - diffusive systems with periodic boundary conditions , have not been widely studied .",
    "+ in this paper we introduce a two - dimensional walk model and calculate its partition function using a transfer matrix method .",
    "we then investigate the critical behaviors of this walk model .",
    "finally , we show that the partition function of the walk model is exactly equal to that of an exactly solvable one - dimensional driven - diffusive system with periodic boundary condition .",
    "it is known that this driven - diffusive system can be mapped to a zero - rage process in which a phase transition into a bose condensate occurs .",
    "consider a walk model in which a random walker starts from the origin @xmath0 and takes a finite number of steps on @xmath1 according to two forthcoming rules .",
    "we assign a weight to each step taken by the random walker .",
    "all the paths made by the random walker are weighted .",
    "the weight of a given path will be equal to the product of the weights of the consecutive steps in that path .",
    "the random walker moves according to the following rules :    *   for @xmath2 from the lattice site @xmath3 to @xmath4 with a weight @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "this is to be referred to as an upward step . *   for @xmath2 from the lattice site @xmath3 to @xmath7 with a weight @xmath8 where @xmath6 . for @xmath9 ( @xmath10 )",
    "this is to be referred to as a downward ( horizontal ) step",
    ".    we will be finally interested in the paths with fixed number of steps ( fixed length ) which contain a certain number of downward and horizontal steps ( equivalently upward steps ) ; therefore , for our later convenience we introduce an ad hoc fugacity @xmath11 and change the second rule as follows :    *   for @xmath2 from the lattice site @xmath3 to @xmath7 with a weight @xmath12 where @xmath6    while keeping the first rule unchanged .",
    "as can be seen the random walker does not take any steps in the negative @xmath13-direction .",
    "let us assume that the random walker starts from the origin @xmath0 and takes @xmath14 consecutive steps according to the above mentioned rules .",
    "the reason that we have chosen the number of steps as @xmath14 will be clear later . after taking these steps the random walker can get to the lattice site @xmath15 where @xmath16 through different paths . in fig . [ graphics ] we have plotted four different paths of length @xmath17 according to the above mentioned rules .",
    "it is easy to see that there is only one path which ends up at the lattice site @xmath18 and has the weight @xmath19 .",
    "it can be verified that there are @xmath20 different ways to get to the lattice site @xmath15 for @xmath21 . the total weight of the paths which end up at the lattice site @xmath15 for @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "+ we define the partition function of the walk model as the sum of the unnormalized weights of different paths consisting of @xmath14 steps .",
    "four different paths of length @xmath17 which end up to different heights @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26.,width=240 ]    in what follows we show that the partition function of the model can be obtained using a transfer matrix method .",
    "we assume that after @xmath13 steps the state ( position ) of the random walker is given by the vector @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the height of the random walker measured from the horizontal axis and can be an integer from @xmath23 to @xmath13 .",
    "these vectors have the following properties : @xmath29 in which @xmath30 is an infinite - dimensional identity matrix .",
    "now we define a transfer matrix @xmath31 with the following property at each step : @xmath32 one can introduce the following matrix representation for the transfer matrix @xmath31 : @xmath33 in fact the transfer matrix @xmath31 updates the state ( position ) of the random walker .",
    "the random walker starts from the origin @xmath0 which is represented by @xmath34 at the zero - th step . after taking @xmath14 steps",
    "the random walker is in the state @xmath27 where @xmath16 . as we mentioned above",
    ", there are different ways ( along different paths ) to get to the lattice site @xmath15 . the total weight associated with the lattice site",
    "@xmath15 is equal to the sum of the weights associated with the paths that end at that lattice site .",
    "it can be verified that : @xmath35 finally the partition function of the model , which is equal to the sum of the weights associated with the lattice sites @xmath15 with @xmath16 , can be easily calculated by multiplying @xmath36 by ( [ powertm ] ) from the left : @xmath37 in which : @xmath38 is the usual binomial coefficient .",
    "as we mentioned above , we are interested in the partition function of the original walk model in a special case that after taking @xmath14 consecutive steps , the random walker has taken exactly @xmath39 upward steps in which @xmath40 . + in order to find the partition function of the model in this case , let us have a closer look at the role of the fugacity @xmath11 .",
    "the weight associated with a horizontal or downward movement is proportional to @xmath11 ; therefore , the coefficient of @xmath41 in ( [ pf1 ] ) is equal to the partition function of the walk model @xmath42 which consists of exactly @xmath39 upward steps",
    ". one can easily use ( [ pf1 ] ) to obtain the coefficient of @xmath41 in @xmath43 . for @xmath44",
    "the result is : @xmath45 and obviously for @xmath46 one finds : @xmath47 the partition function ( [ pf2 ] ) has a simple explanation in terms of the weighted paths in our walk model .",
    "it is the sum of the weights of the paths of length @xmath14 which precisely contain @xmath39 upward steps ( or equivalently @xmath48 horizontal and downward steps ) . + as a relevant quantity",
    ", one can investigate the mean height of the random walker @xmath49 .",
    "the probability of being at the height @xmath28 under the above mentioned conditions is given by : @xmath50 now the height of the random walker averaged over all the steps of each walk and over all the walks is given by : @xmath51 it turns out that in thermodynamic limit @xmath52 with @xmath53 , the mean height of the random walker is given by : @xmath54 as can be seen , there is a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit from a phase in which the mean height of the random walker is of order @xmath55 to another phase where it is a constant .",
    "+ in what follows we show that the partition function of the walk model ( [ pf2 ] ) is exactly equal to that of a driven - diffusive system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is known that this driven - diffusive system is equivalent to a zero - range process in which a real - space bose - einstein condensation occurs .",
    "in @xcite the author introduces a one - dimensional driven - diffusive system of classical particles with hardcore interactions .",
    "the system consists of a particle of type @xmath56 and @xmath48 particles of type @xmath57 moving on a one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath55 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the particle of type @xmath56 hops from the lattice site @xmath13 to @xmath58 with rate @xmath59 provided the target lattice site is empty . the particles of type @xmath57 hop from lattice site @xmath13 to lattice site @xmath58 with rate @xmath24 provided that the target lattice site is empty . if an empty lattice site is represented by @xmath60 , then the dynamical rules are simply as follows : @xmath61 a similar model has also been introduced in @xcite and studied in details in @xcite . in this model the particle of type @xmath56 is called an impurity while the particles of type @xmath57 are called the normal particles .",
    "the normal particles can overtake the impurity .",
    "the model can be exactly solved using a matrix product method .",
    "it turns out that the phase diagram of the model consists of four different phases . in one of the phases the model presents a shock , i.e. a sharp discontinuity between a region of high density of normal particles and a region of low density .",
    "+ it is shown that the probability distribution of the above mentioned system ( the one without overtaking ) can also be obtained using a matrix product method @xcite .",
    "let us label the particle of type @xmath56 with @xmath24 and the particles of type @xmath57 with @xmath62 respectively . according to the matrix product formalism , in the steady - state the probability of finding",
    "the system in the configuration @xmath63 in which @xmath64 empty lattice sites lie in front of the @xmath13th particle is given by : @xmath65 in which the operators @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are associated with the presence of a particle of type @xmath56 , a particle of type @xmath57 and an empty lattice site respectively .",
    "the denominator in ( [ mppdf ] ) is the normalization factor ( which is called the canonical partition function ) and should be calculated by considering the conservation of number of empty lattice sites i.e. @xmath69 . the expression ( [ mppdf ] ) describes the steady - state of the system provided that operators @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 satisfy the following quadratic algebra @xcite : @xmath70 the partition function @xmath42 in ( [ mppdf ] ) has been calculated in @xcite and it turns out that it is exactly equal to that of our walk model given in ( [ pf2 ] ) . in the same reference",
    "the critical behaviors of this driven - diffusive system have been investigated . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath71 and by defining the density of particles @xmath72 as @xmath53 the system undergoes a phase transition from a low - density phase to a high - density phase . in the low - density phase",
    "@xmath73 the number of the empty lattice sites in front of the particle of type @xmath56 is of order @xmath55 . in @xcite the author",
    "has shown that the above mentioned driven - diffusive system can be mapped to a zero - range process by converting the particles into boxes and the empty lattice sites into particles .",
    "the low - density phase in the driven - diffusive system now corresponds to a bose - einstein condensate phase in the equivalent zero - rage process .",
    "in contrast , in the high - density phase @xmath74 the empty lattice sites are uniformly distributed between the particles @xcite .",
    "it is now easy to compare these results with those presented in ( [ meanh2 ] ) for the walk model .",
    "it turns out that the mean height of the random walker @xmath49 is equivalent to the number of empty lattice sites in front of the particle of @xmath56 in the driven - diffusive system .",
    "+ now we explain ( from a mathematical point of view ) why the partition function of the walk model obtained using the transfer matrix method is equal to that of the driven - diffusive system obtained using the matrix product method .",
    "let us start with the driven - diffusive system and the matrix representation of its quadratic algebra .",
    "it can be easily verified that the following infinite - dimensional matrix representation satisfy the algebra ( [ algebra ] ) : @xmath75 in which @xmath76 for @xmath77 . another matrix representation for the algebra ( [ algebra ] )",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "although the number of particles in the driven - diffusive system does not change by the dynamical rules , it is much easier to calculate the grand canonical partition function of the driven - diffusive system by defining @xmath11 as the fugacity of the particles of type @xmath57 .",
    "later we will fix this fugacity by the density of the particles of type @xmath57 . for a system consisting of a single particle of type @xmath56 ,",
    "the unnormalized weight associated with an arbitrary configuration is proportional to @xmath78 in which we have defined @xmath79 and @xmath80 associated with the presence of an empty lattice site and a particle of type @xmath57 at the lattice site @xmath13 respectively .",
    "note that in the canonical ensemble one has @xmath81 .",
    "now the grand canonical partition function is given by : @xmath82 in which we have defined @xmath83 .",
    "the density of the particles of type @xmath57 is related to their fugacity through the following relation :",
    "@xmath84 using the matrix representation ( [ matrixrep ] ) , the grand canonical partition function ( [ gcpf1 ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath85 using ( [ matrixrep ] ) it can be seen that the matrix @xmath86 is exactly equal with the transfer matrix @xmath31 given in ( [ mrt ] ) ; therefore , the grand canonical partition function of the driven - diffusive system ( [ gcpf1 ] ) is equal to the partition function of the walk model ( [ pf1 ] ) where we define the ad hoc fugacity @xmath11 for the horizontal and downward steps .",
    "if we try to impose particle number conservation and adopt a canonical ensemble , then we have to select the coefficient of @xmath41 in ( [ gcpf2 ] ) which is exactly ( [ pf2 ] ) i.e. the partition function of the walk model in the case where the number of upward steps is equal to @xmath39 .",
    "it seems that the connection between the two - dimensional walk models and one - dimensional driven - diffusive systems is of a more general validity than a couple of examples studied thus far .",
    "the asep with open boundaries is an example which has been studied in detail @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors have studied the asep in the case that its steady - states can be written in terms of a superposition of multiple shocks with random walk dynamics .",
    "it turns out that the partition function of the system in this case , is related to that of a walk model consisting of multiple dyck paths .",
    "+ in this paper we introduced a two - dimensional walk model and calculated its partition function using the transfer matrix method .",
    "the paths start from the origin , but in contrast with the perviously introduced walk models , they do not necessarily end on the horizontal axis .",
    "we showed that this walk model is closely related to a one - dimensional driven - diffusive system defined on a closed lattice which can be mapped to a zero - range process @xcite .",
    "as it is pointed in @xcite a real - space bose - einstein condensation can occur in this zero - range process by fine - tuning of the microscopic hopping rates .",
    "the zero - range processes have been extensively studied in related literatures @xcite ; therefore , how the zero - range processes and the walk models are related still remains an open question .",
