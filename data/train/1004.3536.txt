    "often theoretical methods ( in particular computational techniques ) are developed in response to emerging scientific challenges in specific fields .",
    "the development of the shell correction method ( scm ) by strutinsky in the late 1960 s @xcite was motivated by the observation of large nonuniformities ( oscillatory behavior ) exhibited by a number of nuclear properties as a function of the nuclear size .",
    "these properties included : total nuclear masses , nuclear deformation energies , and large distortions and fission barriers . while it was understood already that the total energy of nuclei can be decomposed into an oscillatory part and one that shows a slow `` smooth '' variation as a function of size , strutinsky s seminal contribution was to calculate the two parts from different nuclear models : the former from the nuclear shell model and the latter from the liquid drop model .",
    "in particular , the calculation of the oscillatory part was enabled by employing an averaging method that smeared the single particle spectrum associated with a nuclear model potential .",
    "it is recognized that the strutinsky procedure provides a method which `` reproduces microscopic results in an optimal way using phenomenological models '' @xcite ; in the appendix we describe an adaptation of the strutinsky phenomenological procedure to metal clusters ; we term this procedure as the semi - empirical ( se)-scm .",
    "in this chapter , we focus on our development in the early 1990 s of the microscopic density - functional - theory ( dft)-scm approach @xcite , where we have shown that the total energy of a condensed - matter finite system can be identified with the harris functional [ see eq .",
    "( [ enhar ] ) ] , with the shell correction [ eq .",
    "( [ densh ] ) ] being expressed through both the kinetic energy , @xmath0 , of this functional [ eq .  ( [ tsh ] ) ] and the kinetic energy of an extended - thomas - fermi ( etf ) functional expanded to fourth - order density gradients [ see @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ t4th ] ) ] .",
    "it is important to note that in our procedure an optimized input density is used in the harris functional .",
    "this optimization can be achieved through a variational procedure [ using an orbital - free ( of ) energy functional , e.g. , the etf functional with 4th - order gradients ] with a parametrized trial density profile [ see eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) ] , or through the use [ see eq .",
    "( [ rhoalt ] ) ] of the variational principle applied to an orbital - free energy functional .",
    "( for literature regarding orbital - free kinetic - energy functionals , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite . )",
    "a similar optimization of an of/4th - order - etf density has been shown to be consistent with the strutinsky averaging approach @xcite .",
    "such 4th - order optimization of the input density renders rather ambiguous any direct ( term - by - term ) comparison between the method proposed by us and subsequent treatments , which extend the dft - scm to include higher - order shell - correction terms without input - density optimization @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "indeed , the input - density optimization ( in particular with the use of 4th - order gradients ) minimizes contributions from higher - order shell corrections .    in light of certain existing similarities between the physics of nuclei and clusters ( despite the large disparity in spatial and energy scales and the different origins of inter - particle interactions in these systems ) , in particular the finding of electronic shell effects in clusters @xcite , it was natural to use the jellium model in the early applications of the dft - scm to clusters .",
    "however , as noted @xcite already early on , `` the very good agreement between our results and those obtained via kohn - sham self - consistent jellium calculations suggested that it would be worthwhile to extend the application of our method to more general electronic structure calculations extending beyond the jellium model , where the trial density used for minimization of the etf functional could be taken as a superposition of site densities , as in the harris method . ''",
    "additionally , generalization of the dft - scm method to calculations of extended ( bulk and surface ) systems appeared rather natural .",
    "indeed , recent promising applications of dft - scm in this spirit have appeared @xcite . in this case , the term `` shell correction effects '' is also maintained , although `` quantum interference effects '' could be more appropriate for extended systems .",
    "one of the principle themes in research on finite systems ( e.g. , nuclei , atomic and molecular clusters , and nano - structured materials ) is the search for size - evolutionary patterns ( seps ) of properties of such systems and elucidation of the physical principles underlying such patterns @xcite .",
    "various physical and chemical properties of finite systems exhibit seps , including :    .",
    "structural characteristics pertaining to atomic arrangements and particle morphologies and shapes ;    excitation spectra involving bound - bound transitions , ionization potentials ( ips ) , and electron affinities ( eas ) ;    collective excitations ( electronic and vibrational ) ;    magnetic properties ;    abundance spectra and stability patterns , and their relation to binding and cohesion energetics , and to the pathways and rates of dissociation , fragmentation , and fission of charged clusters ;    thermodynamic stability and phase changes ;    chemical reactivity .     clusters .",

    "@xcite . the solid line at the top panel ( a ) represents the smooth contribution to the theoretical total ips . the solid circles in the middle ( b ) and bottom ( c ) panels are the total scm ips .",
    "the shapes of sodium clusters have been assumed spherical in the middle panel , while triaxial deformations have been considered at the bottom one . ]",
    "the variations with size of certain properties of materials aggregates are commonly found to scale on the average with the surface to volume ratio of the cluster , i.e. , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the surface area , volume , average radius , and number of particles , respectively ( the physical origins of such scaling may vary for different properties ) . in general ,",
    "the behavior of seps in finite systems in terms of such scaling is non - universal , in the sense that it is non - monotonic exhibiting characteristic discontinuities .",
    "nevertheless , in many occasions , it is convenient to analyze the energetics of finite systems in terms of two contributions , namely , ( i ) a term which describes the energetics as a function of the system size in an average sense ( not including shell - closure effects ) , referrred to usually as describing the  smooth \" part of the size dependence , and ( ii ) an electronic shell - correction term .",
    "the first term is the one which is expected to vary smoothly and be expressible as an expansion in @xmath7 , while the second one contains the characteristic oscillatory patterns as the size of the finite system is varied .",
    "such a strategy has been introduced @xcite and often used in studies of nuclei @xcite , and has been adopted recently for investigations of metal clusters , fullerenes @xcite , and metal nanowires @xcite . as a motivating example , we show in the sep of the ips of na@xmath8 clusters , which illustrates odd - even oscillations in the observed spectrum , a smooth description of the pattern [ ( a ) ] , and two levels of shell - corrected descriptions  one assuming spherical symmetry [ ( b ) ] , and the other allowing for triaxial shape deformations [ ( c ) ] .",
    "the progressive improvement of the level of agreement between the experimental and theoretical patterns is evident .",
    "the chapter is organized as follows :    in , the general methodology of shell - correction methods is reviewed , and the microscopic dft - scm is introduced and presented in detail in .",
    "applications of the dft - scm to condensed - matter finite systems are presented in for three different characteristic nanosystems , namely , metal clusters ( ) , charged fullerenes ( ) , and metallic nanowires ( ) .    in the appendix",
    ", we describe the semiempirical scm for clusters , which is closer to the spirit of strutinsky s original phenomenological approach for nuclei .",
    "there we also briefly present applications of the se - scm to triaxial shape deformations and fission of metal clusters .",
    "a summary is given in .",
    "it has long been recognized in nuclear physics that the dependence of ground - state properties of nuclei on the number of particles can be viewed as the sum of two contributions : the first contribution varies smoothly with the particle number ( number of protons @xmath9 and neutrons @xmath10 ) and is referred to as the _ smooth _ part ; the second contribution gives a superimposed structure on the smooth curve and exhibits an oscillatory behavior , with extrema at the nuclear magic numbers @xcite .",
    "nuclear masses have provided a prototype for this behavior @xcite .",
    "indeed , the main contributions to the experimental nuclear binding energies are smooth functions of the number of protons and neutrons , and are described by the semi - empirical mass formula @xcite .",
    "the presence of these smooth terms led to the introduction of the liquid - drop model ( ldm ) , according to which the nucleus is viewed as a drop of a nonviscous fluid whose total energy is specified by volume , surface , and curvature contributions @xcite .",
    "the deviations of the binding energies from the smooth variation implied by the ldm have been shown @xcite to arise from the shell structure associated with the bunching of the discrete single - particle spectra of the nucleons , and are commonly referred to as the shell correction .",
    "substantial progress in our understanding of the stability of strongly deformed open - shell nuclei and of the dynamics of nuclear fission was achieved when strutinsky proposed @xcite a physically motivated efficient way of calculating the shell corrections .",
    "the method consists of averaging [ see the appendix , and ] the single - particle spectra of phenomenological deformed potentials and of subtracting the ensuing average from the total sum of single - particle energies .",
    "while certain analogies , portrayed in experimental data , between properties of nuclei and elemental clusters have been recognized , the nuclear - physics approach of separating the various quantities as a function of size into a smooth part and a shell correction part has only partially been explored in the case of metal clusters . in particular ,",
    "several investigations @xcite had used the etf method in conjunction with the jellium approximation to determine the average ( smooth , in the sense defined above ) behavior of metal clusters , but had not pursued a method for calculating the shell corrections .    in the absence of a method for appropriately calculating shell - corrections for metal clusters in the context of the semiclassical etf method",
    ", it had been presumed that the etf method was most useful for larger clusters , since the shell effects diminish with increasing size .",
    "indeed , several studies had been carried out with this method addressing the asymptotic behavior of ground - state properties towards the behavior of a jellium sphere of infinite size @xcite .",
    "it has been observed @xcite , however , that the single - particle potentials resulting from the semiclassical method are very close , even for small cluster sizes , to those obtained via self - consistent solution of the local density functional approximation ( lda ) using the kohn - sham ( ks ) equations @xcite .",
    "these semiclassical potentials were used extensively to describe the optical ( linear ) response of spherical metal clusters , for small @xcite , as well as larger sizes @xcite ( for an experimental review on optical properties , cf .",
    "refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the results of this approach are consistent with time - dependent local density functional approximation ( tdlda ) calculations which use the ks solutions @xcite .",
    "it is natural to explore the use of these semiclassical potentials , in the spirit of strutinsky s approach , for evaluation of shell corrections in metal clusters of arbitrary size .",
    "below we describe a microscopic derivation of an scm in conjunction with the density functional theory @xcite , and its applications in investigations of the properties of metal clusters and fullerenes .",
    "particularly interesting and promising is the manner by which the shell corrections are introduced by us at the microscopic level through the kinetic energy term @xcite , instead of the traditional semiempirical strutinsky averaging procedure of the single - particle spectrum @xcite . in particular , our approach leads to an energy functional that corrects many shortcomings of the orbital - free dft , and one that is competitive in numerical accuracy and largely advantageous in computational speed compared to the ks method .",
    "underlying the development of the shell - correction method is the idea of approximating the total energy @xmath11 of a finite interacting fermion system as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the part that varies smoothly as a function of system size , and @xmath14 is an oscillatory term .",
    "various implementations of such a separation consist of different choices and methods for evaluating the two terms in eq .",
