    "extended gauge symmetries and the associated heavy neutral gauge bosons , @xmath0 , are a feature of many extensions of the standard model such as grand unified theories , left - right symmetric models , and superstring theories .",
    "if a @xmath0 were discovered it would have important implications for what lies beyond the standard model .",
    "it is therefore important to study and compare the discovery reach for extra gauge bosons at the various facilities that are under consideration for the future . included in the list of proposed facilities considered at the snowmass96 workshop",
    "are high energy @xmath1 and @xmath4 colliders . in this report",
    "we update previous studies @xcite to include these high energy lepton colliders .",
    "quite a few models predicting extra gauge bosons exist in the literature . we will present search limits for several of these models which , although far from exhaustive , form a representative set for the purposes of comparison .",
    "the models chosen for study are listed below but for details we direct the interested reader to ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "( i ) : :    effective rank-5 models originating from @xmath5 grand    unified theories are conveniently labelled in terms of the decay chain    @xmath6 .",
    "thus ,    the @xmath0 charges are given by linear combinations of the    @xmath7 and @xmath8 charges resulting    in the @xmath0-fermion couplings :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is a free parameter which lies in the    range @xmath11 .",
    "specific models of interest are model @xmath12    ( @xmath13 ) corresponding to the extra    @xmath0 of @xmath14 , model @xmath15    ( @xmath16 ) corresponding to the extra    @xmath0 of @xmath5 , and model @xmath17    ( @xmath18 ) corresponding to the    extra @xmath0 arising in some superstring theories .",
    "( ii ) : :    the left - right symmetric model ( lrm ) extends the standard model gauge    group to @xmath19 .",
    "it has a    parameter @xmath20 with    @xmath21 .",
    "we    assume @xmath22 in our analysis which corresponds to    strict left - right symmetry .",
    "( iii ) : :    the alternative left - right symmetric model ( alrm ) originates from    @xmath5 gut s and is also based on the electroweak gauge    group @xmath19 . here",
    "the    assignments for @xmath23 differ from that of the usual    lrm due to an ambiguity in how the fermions are embedded in the 27    representation of @xmath5 .",
    "( iv ) : :    the `` sequential '' standard model ( ssm ) consists of a @xmath0    which is just a heavy version of the sm @xmath24 boson with    identical couplings .",
    "although it is not a realistic model it is often    used as a benchmark and for purposes of comparison .",
    "( v ) : :    the harvard model ( harv ) is based on the gauge group    @xmath25 , i.e. , left - handed    leptons ( quarks ) transform as doublets under @xmath26    ( @xmath27 ) and singlets under @xmath27    ( @xmath26 ) , and right - handed fields are singlets under    both groups .",
    "this model has a parameter @xmath28 which lies    in the range @xmath29 .",
    "we take    @xmath30 in our calculations .",
    "the @xmath0    is purely left handed in this model .",
    "there are numerous other models in the literature predicting @xmath0 s but the subset described above have properties reasonably representative of broad classes of models , at least for the purposes of comparing search limits of high energy colliders .",
    "at @xmath1 colliders searches for @xmath0 s are indirect , being inferred from deviations from the standard model predictions due to interference between the @xmath0 propagator and the @xmath31 and @xmath24 propagators @xcite .",
    "this is similar to pep / petra seeing the standard model @xmath24 as deviations from the predictions of qed .",
    "the basic process is @xmath32 where @xmath33 could be leptons @xmath34 or quarks @xmath35 and @xmath36 denotes the @xmath37 polarization .",
    "the cross section for the basic process is given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 where the @xmath40 are the sm @xmath24 couplings and the @xmath41 are the @xmath0 couplings .",
    "for right - handed electrons make the substitutions @xmath42 and @xmath43 . from these expressions",
    "we can obtain everything else we need .",
    "for example , the total differential cross section is just @xmath44\\ ] ] and the various polarized or unpolarized total cross sections can be obtained by integrating these expressions .",
    "the spin averaged ( unpolarized ) cross section is given by : @xmath45\\ ] ]    from the basic reactions a number of observables can be used to search for the effects of @xmath0 s :    * @xmath46  the cross section to specific final state fermions * @xmath47  the ratio of the hadronic to the qed point cross section * @xmath48  the forward - backward asymmetry to fermion @xmath33 in the final state ; @xmath49 d\\cos\\theta   { { d\\sigma}\\over{d\\cos\\theta } } } \\over { \\left [ { \\int^1_0 -\\int^0_{-1 } } \\right ] d\\cos\\theta   { { d\\sigma}\\over{d\\cos\\theta } } } } \\ ] ] * @xmath50  the left - right asymmetry with fermion @xmath33 in the final state ; @xmath51 * @xmath52  the left - right asymmetry with hadrons in the final state * @xmath53  the polarized forward - backward double asymmetry with fermion @xmath33 in the final state ; @xmath54 * @xmath55  the tau polarization    in these expressions we generally take the index @xmath56 and @xmath57`sum over all hadrons ' to indicate the final state fermions .    to obtain discovery limits for new physics , which in this case means evidence for extra neutral gauge bosons , we look for statistically significant deviations from standard model expectations . in fig . 1 a number of observables",
    "are shown with their standard model values and for various @xmath0 s as a function of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the error bars are based on the statistics expected in the standard model .",
    "( note that there is a cheat here in that i did not include @xmath58 and @xmath59-quark tagging efficiences in the statistical errors so that in reality some of the error bars should really be bigger than what is shown . )",
    "what is important to note here is that the different observables have different sensitivities to the different models .",
    "for example , of the models shown , @xmath60 is most sensitive to @xmath61 while @xmath62 is most sensitive to @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , @xmath64 is most sensitive to @xmath61 while @xmath65 is most sensitive to @xmath63 . therefore to have the highest possible reach for the largest number of possible models it is important to include all possible observables .",
    "we quantify the sensitivity to an extra gauge boson by comparing the predictions for various observables assuming the presence of a @xmath0 to the predictions of the standard model and constructing the @xmath66 figure of merit ; @xmath67 where the sum is over observables included in the @xmath66 and @xmath68 is the experimental error of the observable .",
    "the contributions of some observables to the @xmath66 for @xmath63 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath61 are shown in figure 2 .",
    "there are several points to note from this figure .",
    "first , we again see that the observables have different sensitivities to the various models so that it is important to consider as many observables as possible .",
    "second , the polarization asymmetries are in many cases the most sensitive observables so that polarization is potentially very important for searches for @xmath0 s . and finally , flavour tagging can contribute a considerable amount of information .    to obtain `` discovery '' limits for the @xmath1 case",
    "we include the eighteen observables : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath62 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath55 . for the @xmath2 case we included the ten observables that did not involve polarized electrons .",
    "in calculating the @xmath66 we assumed 90% electron polarization , 35% @xmath58-tagging efficiency and 60% @xmath59-tagging efficiency . the 99% c.l .",
    "discovery limits are shown in figure 3 .",
    "only statistical errors are considered in obtaining the limits shown .    because search limits obtained at @xmath1 colliders are indirect , based on deviations from the standard model in precision measurements , they are sensitive to both statistical and systematic errors .",
    "if , for example , the nlc integrated luminosity is reduced from 50  fb@xmath87 to 10  fb@xmath87 ( 200  fb@xmath87 to 50  fb@xmath87 ) for the 500  gev ( 1  tev ) case , the search limits are reduced by about 33% . including a 5% systematic error in cross section measurements due to , for example , luminosity uncertainties , and a 2% systematic error in asymmetries where systematic errors partially cancel",
    ", typically reduces these numbers by 30% although in some cases ( the ssm ) it can reduce the limits by up to 50% .",
    "clearly , systematic errors will have to be kept under control for high precision measurements .",
    "finally , we did not include initial rate radiation ( isr ) .",
    "rizzo has found that including isr can lower the search reach by 1520% @xcite .",
    "one sees that the discovery limits obtained at @xmath1 colliders can be quite substantial although they can be quite model dependent .",
    "for example , for the @xmath88 , @xmath89 so that either @xmath90 or @xmath91 . for @xmath92",
    "sufficiently far away from the @xmath24 pole deviations are dominated by @xmath93 and @xmath94 interference which is proportional to @xmath95 . since for the photon @xmath96 ,",
    "when @xmath90 is also equal to 0 deviations from the standard model become small .",
    "in this report we have shown that high luminosity lepton colliders can put limits on the existence of extra gauge bosons via deviations of measurements from their standard model values .",
    "the so called discovery limits can be many times the centre of mass energy of the collider . polarization and flavour",
    "tagging are important in realizing the highest discovery limits possible . since bounds on @xmath0 s are based on precision measurements they are quite sensitive to measurement errors . given the high statistics , to achieve the highest possible discovery limits , it will be crucial to minimize systematic errors .",
    "finally , we note that while the non - observation of deviations from the sm will put constraints on the existence of @xmath0 s , if deviations are found , disentangling the underlying physics will be far from trivial .",
