    "we built a generative model that describes the probability of generation of recombined sequences , following the theoretical framework described in @xcite .",
    "the generation probability for each sequence is calculated as the sum over all recombination scenarios @xmath11 that can produce that sequence , @xmath12 . for tcr alpha chains the model assumes the following factorized form for a recombination scenario defined by the choice of genes ( v and j ) , @xmath13 , deletions ( delv and delj ) , @xmath14 and @xmath15 and insertions ( ins ) , @xmath16 : @xmath17    the parameters of the models , the different probabilities in the factorized formula ,",

    "the model was reformulated as a hidden markov model , and the parameters were learned efficiently using a baum - welch algorithm , as described in @xcite .",
    "for beta chains , the model describes probabilities for v , d and j choices , with possible deletions and insertions at each of the two junctions :    @xmath18    the parameters for the beta chain model were inferred directly using the expectation - maximization algorithm , by enumerating all possible recombination scenarios that can produce each sequence , using the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "this procedure allows us to learn the features of the recombination statistics with great accuracy , in particular the distribution of number of insertions at the junctions , even though the recombination events themselves can not be unambiguously be determined for each sequence because of convergent recombination .",
    "we applied the procedure described in the previous section separately for each abundance class of the beta - chain sequences .",
    "however , given the small size of the datasets ( 2000 or 3000 sequences ) , we did not learn the full model for each class .",
    "instead , we used a previously inferred universal beta - chain recombination model @xcite for the v , d , j gene usages and their deletion profiles , and we learned the insertion distributions ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) for each class separately , while keeping the other parameters constant .",

    "in - frame sequences statistically differ from out - of - frame sequences ( besides their frameshift ) , because in - frame sequences are functional and have passed thymic selection . for each sequence we defined a selection factor @xmath21 as the ratio of the probability of observing the sequence in the in - frame set , to the probability of recombining the sequence according to out - of - frame statistics ( as inferred above ) .",
    "the overal selection factor @xmath21 is assumed to be the product of several independent factors @xmath22 acting on the cdr3 length @xmath23 and on the identity of amino acid @xmath24 at each position @xmath25 of the cdr3 @xcite : @xmath26 the parameters were inferred by maximizing the likelihood with gradient ascent , as described in @xcite .",
    "analysis of the shared clonotypes was performed using the r statistical programming language @xcite and the tcr package @xcite .      to predict sharing for each individual , we generated sequences using our recombination model @xmath1 ( alpha or beta ) , with individually inferred model parameters .",
    "normalized sharing of the tcr sequences between two clonesets is defined as the number of the same unique tcr nucleotide sequences observed in both of them , divided by the product of the total numbers of unique tcr nucleotide sequences in the two datasets .",
    "we calculated sharing of either whole chains , or of their cdr3 , defined as the sub - sequence going from the conserved cystein at the end of the v region , to the conserved phenylalanine in the j region .",

    "the model systematically underestimates the normalized sharing by a common multiplicative factor of 1.7 for non - twins , with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8 between the data and the model prediction .",
    "absolute numbers of shared cdr3 sequences for alpha chains varied from 400 to 1200 .    for beta chain sequences , the prediction of out - of - frame sharing is more difficult because of the low numbers of out - of - frame sequences in the rna data , which , combined to a lower mean @xmath1 , results in a much lower number of shared out - of - frame sequences",
    ". we also identified and removed from the dataset @xmath27 out - of - frame sequences shared between more than two individuals .",
    "these sequences are likely to arise due to reproducible aligner errors or technology artifacts  some of them contained intronic sequences , etc .",
    "absolute numbers of shared beta cdr3 sequences varied from 0 to 82 .",
    "nevertheless , the number of shared beta out - of - frame cdr3 sequences for twins exceeded the model prediction ( see fig .  [ figs6 ] ) , confirming our hypothesis of biological contamination during pregnancy .      to accurately predict the normalized sharing number for in - frame nucleotide clonotypes , we generated sequences from @xmath1 as we did for out - of - frame sequences , but weighted them by their selection factor @xmath21 to account for thymic selection .",
    "the predicted normalized sharing number was then calculated as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are two synthetic sequence samples drawn from two models @xmath31,@xmath32 individually learned from the out - of - frame sequences of two individuals , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 are selection factors learned individually from these two individuals in - frame sequences . @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the size of the two samples .",
    "the sum runs over sequences @xmath37 found in both samples .    for both the beta and the alpha chains",
    ", the prediction agrees very well with the data ( fig .",
    "[ figs5 ] and fig .  [ figs4 ] ) .",
    "for the beta chain , twins share more cdr3 sequences than non - twin pairs , while no such effect was observed for the alpha chain sequences .",
    "this fact could be explained by the much higher number of clonotypes shared due to convergent recombination in the alpha in - frame dataset than in the beta in - frame and alpha and beta out - of - frame datasets .",
    "excess of shared cdr3 nucleotide sequences due to biological contamination in twins is lower than the amount of convergent recombination noise in the alpha in - frame shared cdr3 nucleotide sequences .",
    "absolute numbers of shared in - frame cdr3 sequences for alpha chains varied from 30000 - 50000 sequences depending of the pair , and 5000 - 9000 for beta chains .",
    "we hypothesized that the larger amount of zero insertion clonotypes is responsible for the increase in sharing between the most abundant clonotypes of the out - of - frame repertoires of unrelated individuals . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we constructed a mixture model for each abundance class , each class containing 2000 clonotypes ranked by decreasing abundance .",
    "we assume that abundance class @xmath4 contains a fraction @xmath5 of clonotypes generated with zero insertions , and @xmath6 of regular clonotypes .",
    "obtaining @xmath5 is not straightforward because regular clonotypes can also zero insertions .",
    "in addition , the number of insertions can not be determined with certainty  for example , a deletion followed by an insertion matching the germline sequence can be wrongly interpreted as a case of no insertions .    to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we determine for each abundance class a simpler quantity to estimate , namely the fraction @xmath38 of clonotypes that are consistent with zero insertions , _",
    "i.e. _ that can be entirely matched to the germline genes .",
    "because of the reasons outlined above , @xmath38 is _ not _ equal to @xmath5 .",
    "however , @xmath38 is a linear function of @xmath5 , @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , if we can generate synthetic sequences such that their @xmath38 agrees with data , then we are guaranteed that their @xmath5 will coincide with the data as well , even if we do not know the explicit mixing parameters @xmath5 .    to obtain this mixture",
    ", we generated many sequences from our recombination model @xmath1 . to determine which generated sequences were consistent with zero insertions , we aligned them to all possible v and j genomic templates .",
    "we then separated out the sequences consistent with zero insertions from the others , and created , for each abundance class @xmath4 , and artificial dataset with a fraction @xmath38 of such sequences , and @xmath40 of the other sequences ( not consistent with zero insertions ) , where @xmath38 is given by the data .",
    "we then calculated normalized sharing in the synthetic data by including an increasing number of abundance classes , starting with the most abundant ones , and compared to data in fig .",
    "we fit an exponential decay curve to the fraction @xmath41 of zero - insertion clonotypes in the 2000 most abundant clones as a function of age @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "4 ) : @xmath43 we found @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 using the nlm2 r package .",
    "we fitted an analogous model for the attrition of the naive t - cell pool , _",
    "i.e. _ the fraction @xmath47 of naive t - cells as identified using flow cytometry ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath48 we obtained @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the data used in the two model fits are available in table s3 .",
    "shared clonotypes in unrelated individuals appear in the process of convergent recombination .",
    "sequences with a higher @xmath1 are thus more likely to be shared , and we can calculate accurately the distribution of @xmath1 among shared sequences ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "we observe that sequences shared between twins violate this prediction , consistent with our hypothesis that some of these sequences are due to biological contamination . to confirm this",
    ", we used a sequence feature that is negatively correlated with @xmath1 @xcite : the number of insertions in the cdr3 region .",
    "the number of insertions in cdr3 sequences shared between unrelated individuals was indeed lower ( fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] ) than the mean number of insertions in non - shared sequences .",
    "however , the mean number of insertions in sequences shared between twins ( black boxes ) is higher than in unrelated individuals .",
    "the same and even stronger effect is observed for memory ( cd45ro+ ) cells ( fig .",
    "[ figs3 ] ) .",
    "two individuals displayed the most prominent excess of shared beta out - of - frame sequences . since the model prediction for the number of shared sequences is close to zero",
    "we suppose that most of these shared sequences did not arise due to convergent recombination .",
    "these out - of - frame clones bear a second functional allele ( otherwise they would have been filtered by selection in a thymus ) , and they also should have either the cd4 or the cd8 phenotype . to attribute these clonotypes a phenotype we separately sequenced cd4 , cd8 and cd45ro positive subsets for the two donors and searched for the @xmath51 out - of - frame cdr3s shared between the unpartitioned out - of - frame repertoires .",
    "@xmath52 cdr3s were found in the cd8 subsets of both individuals , and only @xmath53 sequences were found in the cd4 subsets of both individuals . @xmath54 out of the @xmath52 cd8 and @xmath55 out of the @xmath53 sequences were also found in the 45ro+ compartment .",
    "only @xmath55 sequences were mapped discordantly ( e.g. cd4 in one twin and cd8 in the second twin ) , and @xmath56 sequences were absent from the cd4 , cd8 and cd45ro compartments of both individuals . for the other @xmath57 sequences the cd4/cd8 status could be determined only for one individual ( most probably due to the sequencing depth limitations ) . in case of convergent recombination it is unlikely that shared nonproductive sequences would have the same phenotype in different donors .",
    "the phenotypic study thus confirms the biological contamination hypothesis .",
    "we tested the robustness of our results on previously published twin data from @xcite .",
    "we observed the same excess of low - probability shared sequences in twins compared to unrelated individuals as in fig .  2 ( see fig .  [ figs7 ] ) .",
    "these data also allowed us to control for possible experimental contamination .",
    "one of the twin pairs that participated in the present study was sequenced three years ago , using a different technology described in @xcite , excluding the possibility of any contamination between the old and new samples . out of @xmath51 beta",
    "out - of - frame clonotypes shared between two new twin samples , @xmath58 were also shared between the new sample of one twin , and the old sample of the second twin .",
    "therefore the out - of - frame sequences shared between the twins are reproducible and could not be result of experimental contamination with pcr - products or rna .",
    "it was previously shown that mucosal - associated invariant t - cells ( mait ) and natural killer t - cells ( nkt ) have an invariant alpha chain with very low diversity @xcite .",
    "specific v - j combinations are chosen ( trav10/traj18 for nkts and trav1 - 2/traj33 for mait ) and no nucleotides are inserted in the recombination process of these clonotypes . to see whether these clonotypes could potentially confound our analysis , we searched for published nkt and mait sequences in our datasets . @xmath54 out of the @xmath59 known mait sequences were found in the datasets at least once ( @xmath60 out of them in the all six individuals ) , and @xmath61 out of the @xmath62 known nkt sequences ( @xmath56 of them in the all six individuals ) .",

    "<S> taken together , these observations support the existence of another source of shared sequences than coincidence in twins . since the sharing of cord blood between twins is the only natural instance when the immune systems of two individuals share cells , we propose that the increased sharing of private tcrs between identical twins dates back to the sharing of cord blood cells , and that these shared clones persist into late age .         </S>",
    "<S> to verify this hypothesis , we characterized the in - frame beta - chain repertoire of human cord blood ( see si materials and methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> one feature of the rearranged chains is the number of insertions at the junctions between the gene segments ( vd and dj in the case of beta chains ) . </S>",
    "<S> we ranked beta tcr clonotypes from human cord blood data by decreasing abundances and plotted the mean number of insertions ( inferred iteratively and averaged over groups of 3000 clonotypes , see si methods ) , as a function of this abundance rank ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most abundant clones in cord blood had markedly smaller numbers of insertions ( black line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the naive repertoire of a young adult ( blue line ) showed a much weaker dependence on abundance than the cord blood repertoire , but followed a similar trend . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence was even further reduced in older adults ( purple and green lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the number of insertions in the beta chains of the adult memory repertoire ( red , orange and maroon lines ) did not depend of the abundance of these cells . </S>",
    "<S> this observation can be explained by the resetting of the size of memory clones following an infection , erasing features of the abundance distribution inherited from fetal life . </S>",
    "<S> looking more closely into the distribution of the number of insertions ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b ) reveals that low mean numbers of insertions are associated with an enrichment in clonotypes with zero insertions . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the fraction of naive zero - insertion sequences generally decreased with abundance rank ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c ) , with again a stronger dependency in cord blood and young adults . </S>",
    "<S> fewer numbers of insertions in the cord blood are expected because tdt , the enzyme responsible for random insertions , is initially strongly downregulated in prenatal development @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this enrichment in low - insertion sequences persists and shows weak signatures in the adult naive repertoire , suggesting long lifetimes of cord blood clonotypes ( although not necessarily of individual cells ) .        </S>",
    "<S> the enrichment of zero - insertion sequences in large clonotypes can be used to verify the hypothesis of long lived fetal clonotypes originating from the cord blood . analysing tcr beta repertoire data from individuals of different ages @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we observed a slow decay of abundant zero - insertion clonotypes with age , with a characteristic time of 37 years ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the excess of abundant tdt- clonotypes of fetal origin only affects naive cells ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] and s10 ) , whose relative fraction is also known to decrease with time @xcite . to assess the importance of this confounding effect </S>",
    "<S> , we fit an exponential decay model for the percentage of naive cells and found a characteristic decay time of 67 years . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , the attrition of the naive pool alone can not explain the decrease of zero - insertion clonotypes , which we attribute instead to the progressive extinction of clones of fetal origin , consistently with our hypothesis .     </S>",
    "<S> ]    fetal clones are directly exchanged between twins through cord blood and then persist with age , explaining the enhanced sharing between them . at the same time , tdt- zero - insertion clonotypes are also most likely to be shared by chance than regular tdt+ sequences , because of their fewer number of insertions and reduced diversity . </S>",
    "<S> what are the implications of this observation for sharing between non - twins ? </S>",
    "<S> since zero - insertion sequences are overrepresented among abundant clonotypes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) , we predict that abundant out - of - frame clones are more likely to be shared . to make our prediction quantitative </S>",
    "<S> , we built a mixture model of the out - of - frame alpha repertoire ( see si text for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed that clonotypes of a given abundance @xmath4 are made up of a certain fraction @xmath5 of tdt- zero - insertion clonotypes , and a complementary fraction @xmath6 of regular tdt+ clonotypes . because tdt+ clonotypes may also have no insertions , the fraction of the tdt+ and tdt- sets had to be learned in a self - consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> sequences were generated by the model for each abundance class @xmath4 , and their sharing compared to the data . </S>",
    "<S> the model accurately predicts the normalized sharing number of out - of - frame alpha - chain cdr3s as a function of clonotype abundance ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] ) , up to the common multiplicative factor of 1.7 by which the non - mixture model generally underestimates cdr3 sharing ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the enhanced sharing of high - abundance clonotypes is entirely attributable to their higher propensity to have no insertions , making them more likely to be shared by chance .    </S>",
    "<S> our results on the biological contamination of t cells in twins are robust to possible experimental artefacts . </S>",
    "<S> first , our framework relies on the accurate counting of tcr cdna sequences using unique molecule identifiers@xcite . to exclude the possibility of contamination during the pcr and sequencing process </S>",
    "<S> , we double barcoded each cdna library . to further exclude the possibility of early contamination of the blood samples , we performed replicate experiments at different times using different library preparation protocols . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of repertoire overlaps from such replicate experiments for the same set of twins shows no difference and rules out experimental contamination as a confounding effect ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also observed the same effects in previously and independently collected datasets @xcite , further excluding the possibility of experimental artefacts ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s8 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> cord blood sharing between twin embryos could have important implications on twin immunity : they could share and respond with private clonotypes , which would otherwise not be likely to be produced independently . </S>",
    "<S> this could possibly include sharing of malignant @xcite or autoimmune clones , leading to disease in both individuals . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism of sequence sharing is very different from sharing by convergent recombination @xcite , because it also implies the sharing of the second tcr chain and of the cell phenotype . </S>",
    "<S> paired repertoires studies , which combine alpha and beta chains together @xcite , could be used to track clones shared between twins more precisely , and distinguish them from convergently recombined ones .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that fetal clonotypes are long - lived based on the analysis of over - abundant zero - insertion clonotypes . </S>",
    "<S> invariant t - cells , mait ( mucosal - associated invariant t - cells ) and inkt ( invariant natural killer t - cells ) are intrinsically insertion - less , have restricted vj usage for alpha chain , and are often abundant . </S>",
    "<S> these cells are produced in adulthood and could in principle constitute a substantial fraction of our zero - insertion dataset , confounding our analysis . since our abundant zero - insertion clonotypes have a very diverse usage of vj genes , we can exclude that the majority of them are from invariant t - cells , although we did identify a small number of such invariant tcr alpha chain clonotypes , see si .    </S>",
    "<S> our current data clearly shows that clonotypes that originated in the cord blood tend to be among the most abundant in the naive repertoire , but we can not unambiguously point to the source of this effect . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is convergent recombination @xcite : high clonotypes abundances could be due to the accumulation of multiple convergent recombination events made more likely by the limited recombination diversity during fetal development . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative explanation is that these clones have had more time to expand than others . </S>",
    "<S> fetal cells come from different precursors , and mature in a different environment ( the fetal liver ) , than post - natal cells @xcite . _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> experiments have shown that fetal t - cells have a different proliferation potential than post - fetal cells @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , a vacant ecological niche effect may play a role . when these clones first appeared , the repertoire had not reached its carrying capacity set by homeostatic regulation , leaving room for future expansion . </S>",
    "<S> these clones may have initially filled the repertoire , later to be gradually replaced by post - fetal clonotypes . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , fetal clones , including those whose tcr was recombined with no tdt , would be expected to have larger sizes . </S>",
    "<S> clones with non - zero numbers of insertions could also originate in the cord blood as tdt is upregulated , however we have no way of distinguishing them from postnatal clones . quantitative tcr repertoire profiling ( preferably with the use of unique molecular identifiers for accurate data normalization and error correction ) , performed for species with no tdt activity in the embryo , such as mice , as well as novel cell lineage tracking techniques @xcite could be used to investigate the detailed dynamics of fetal clones . </S>",
    "<S> this large initial expansion of fetal clones could protect them from later extinction . </S>",
    "<S> this would suggest that the estimated 37-year lifetime of zero - insertion fetal clonotypes could be longer than that of regular clones produced after birth .    </S>",
    "<S> the proposed large initial expansion of fetal clones could protect them from later extinction . </S>",
    "<S> this would suggest that the estimated 37-year lifetime of zero - insertion fetal clonotypes could be longer than that of regular clones produced after birth . </S>",
    "<S> sharing of beta tcrs has previously been shown to decrease with age @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> depletion of fetal clonotypes , which are more likely to be shared , could contribute to this phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> our results also predict that the excess sharing of clonotypes between twins due to the biological contamination of fetal cells should decrease with age . in general , the observed abundance of large zero - insertion clonotypes and their persistence through significant part of our life should have important consequences for the adaptive immunity regulation both in pre- and post - fetal period .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , our general framework for analyzing the overlap between different repertoires has far - reaching practical implications for the tracking of t - cell clonotypes in the clinic . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the analysis of overlap between pre- and post - treatment repertoires using probabilistic characteristics of clonotypes sharing could help determine the host or donor origin of clonotypes after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) , and also increase reliability of malignant clones identification in minimal residual disease follow - up .    </S>",
