    "we want to study the correlation between the probability to observe a large value in the acceleration fluctuations and the local eulerian structure of the flow . to do that we first define the longitudinal and centripetal instantaneous acceleration to be @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively ; where @xmath21 is the particle velocity unit vector , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the eulerian velocity field .",
    "similarly , we are interested to the square of the antisymmetric part of the stress tensor , the enstrophy , @xmath18 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the vorticity . in a purely circular motion of radius @xmath26 , around a vortex filament with vorticity , @xmath25",
    ", we expect that the centripetal acceleration can be expressed as : @xmath27 which is a direct links between the local properties of the enstrophy and the statistics of the centripetal acceleration .",
    "the above argument does not fix the @xmath28 proportionality prefactor , which depends on the exact shape of the vortex filament . in order to probe how much the rare , but intense , events characterizing the tails of the acceleration statistics",
    "are indeed caused by trapping in regions of high vorticity we studied the joint probability densities of centripetal acceleration and enstrophy , compared with the joint probability density of longitudinal acceleration and enstrophy ( for recent similar investigation in experimental and numerical data , see @xcite ) : @xmath29 where we concentrate directly with the logarithm of the variable to better appreciate extreme events .",
    "let us first show in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] the probability density function of the three unconditioned quantities : @xmath30 according to relation ( [ eq : cen ] ) one would expect that if intense tails in the centripetal acceleration are due to the vortex trapping at kolmogorov scale @xmath31 , then the two pdf , @xmath32 and @xmath33 should have the same behavior for large values after the rescaling @xmath34 is made .",
    "this is what we showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] where one can see that the two tails corresponding to @xmath35 and to @xmath33 almost perfectly superpose ( within @xmath28 prefactors which are out of control with dimensional arguments ) .",
    "( @xmath36 , red curve ) , longitudinal acceleration @xmath37 ( @xmath14 , blue curve ) and of the enstrophy , @xmath33 ( @xmath38 , green curve ) .",
    "acceleration amplitudes are rescaled with the kolmogorov scale @xmath31 to test relation ( [ eq : cen ] ) . ]",
    "however , from the unconditional pdf shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] there are not strong signs distinguishing the dynamical properties of centripetal and longitudinal acceleration .",
    "similarly , the joint probability densities ( [ eq : condpdf ] ) plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : condpdf ] do not show any quantitative differences between the statistics of the centripetal and longitudinal acceleration .",
    "( left panel ) , and of longitudinal acceleration and enstrophy @xmath39 ( right panel ) .",
    "notice that the two shapes are almost indistinguishable . ]",
    "this is quite natural , because the motion of a particle in a turbulent field will be characterized by different accelerations and decelerations , not necessarily associated with spiraling motion ( on average the mean value of the acceleration will be zero ) .",
    "the distinguishing character of vortex trapping is the strong persistence of the direction -and amplitude- of the centripetal acceleration for time lags much larger than @xmath7 , at variance with what happens to the longitudinal acceleration , see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    to make this statement quantitative ,",
    "we have studied the running average of the centripetal and longitudinal acceleration , over a time window varying up to @xmath40 @xcite : @xmath41 we expect that the pdfs of the averaged centripetal and longitudinal acceleration will behave very differently at increasing the window size , @xmath42 . in particular , the strong persistence of the centripetal acceleration up to @xmath43 suggests that the joint pdf of centripetal acceleration and enstrophy , @xmath44 should remain almost unchanged at varying @xmath42 , while the longitudinal one @xmath45 should experience a strong depletion , of events with simultaneous intense values of acceleration and vorticity .     for the centripetal acceleration and the local enstrophy without any average in time ( i.e. @xmath46 ) .",
    "acceleration is plotted on the @xmath47 axis while the enstrophy is plotted on the @xmath48 axis .",
    "( right panel ) . the same but for the longitudinal acceleration , @xmath49 .",
    "the isoline is drawn for a fixed value of @xmath50 , to guide the eyes .",
    "notice the strong correlation between intense vorticity events and intense centripetal and longitudinal acceleration ( bottom right corner ) . without averaging in time ,",
    "no clear distinction between longitudinal and centripetal signal can be detected .",
    "as expected , the distinction arises only when persistent effects are investigated , see figure ( [ fig : resave100 ] ) . ]    , for the centripetal acceleration and the local enstrophy after averaging in time , over a window @xmath51 .",
    "( right panel ) . the same but for the longitudinal acceleration , @xmath49 .",
    "the isoline is drawn for a fixed value of @xmath50 , to guide the eyes .",
    "notice the persistence of the strong correlation present between intense vorticity events and intense centripetal acceleration .",
    "on the other hand , now the longitudinal acceleration is not any more correlated for intense events with the enstrophy ( compare the bottom right corners of both panels ) . ]",
    "a way to offer a quantitative measurement of the correlation between the two variables entering the joint pdf , @xmath52 , is to plot the residual value , @xmath53 , obtained by subtracting the probability density in the case of fully uncorrelated variables , @xmath54 .",
    "this is what we show in figs .",
    "( [ fig : resave1]-[fig : resave100 ] ) where we compare the residual value for the averaged centripetal acceleration and the local enstrophy : @xmath55 and the same quantity for the longitudinal one : @xmath56 for two different values of the window , @xmath42 .",
    "let us stress that the difference from zero of the residual values here defined give a direct measurement of the level of correlation between the two fluctuating quantities .",
    "positive values of the difference in ( [ eq : diff1 ] ) and ( [ eq : diff2 ] ) indicate correlation while negative values indicate anti - correlation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : resave1 ] we plot the case of ( no - average in time ) @xmath46 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : resave100 ] the case of @xmath51 . as one can see , in the first case , ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resave1 ] ) , a strong correlation between extreme events in the acceleration and the vorticity is observed , although almost no difference is detectable between the longitudinal and centripetal acceleration ( right and left panels , respectively ) . on the other hand ,",
    "once averaged in time , i.e. filtering out the high oscillation in the longitudinal acceleration , a strong pick in the acceleration - vorticity contour plot is visible only for the centripetal case ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : resave100 ] .",
    "this is in our view a simple but effective way to highlight the strong correlation between the observed high tails in the acceleration distribution and the presence of vortex filaments in the eulerian field .",
    "we have presented results on the joint lagrangian acceleration statistics and eulerian vorticity field from dns of fully developed turbulence . in particular",
    "we have shown the existence of strong correlation between intense and persistent centripetal acceleration and the presence of intense vortical structure .",
    "no effects similar to this one is detected for the longitudinal components of the acceleration .",
    "we interpret this as an evidence of particle trapping in vortex filaments .",
    "further investigations are necessary in order to understand if and how this events affects the local energy transfer mechanism and , if it is the case , how to include the presence of these filamentary structure in the energy cascade phenomenology .",
