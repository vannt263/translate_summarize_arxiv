    "measurement of the  is of enormous importance in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy . since the historical introduction of bloch equations to describe the time evolution of the perturbed magnetization , the knowledge of  plays a significant role in understanding the dynamics of spin systems @xcite .    to measure the",

    "the magnetizations for various @xmath3 values measure the recovery from inverted state towards the equilibrium value .",
    "the most time consuming step in this experiment is the recovery period @xmath4 during which the magnetization is repeatedly required to recover to its equilibrium value , necessitating @xmath5 .",
    "the measurement of long therefore takes significant time .",
    "many methods have been suggested which speed - up the process , but with limited success .",
    "for example , a null measurement in an  experiment yields approximate value in a short time @xcite .",
    "saturation recovery methods take less time than  since the recovery time is replaced by a saturation burst which usually takes @xmath6 1 @xcite .",
    "progressive saturation method is the most commonly used method for long 1  measurements @xcite .",
    "freeman and wittekeok suggested a fast method for 1  measurements , which works for spins which gives extremely narrow lines ( @xmath7 0.1 hz ) in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "but for accurate measurements the  method is still most commonly employed technique @xcite .",
    "recently frydman  _ et  al _ have utilized the echo - planar imaging protocols to speed - up acquiring of two and multi - dimensional nmr experiments in which different slices of the sample ( separated by using a linear gradient ) are excited sequentially to encode indirect time evolution information , followed by a series of frequency - discriminated acquisitions , which are done in a single scan @xcite .",
    "experimental times have been reduced from hours to seconds , without significant loss in s / n ratio . at the same time , several new experiments have been developed which speed - up multi - dimensional nmr experiments , such as g - matrix fourier transform nmr ( gft ) and a single scan measurement of diffusion coefficients @xcite .",
    "following frydman s idea , we describe here a _",
    "fast _ method of measurement of , by a single scan experiment for samples having sufficient s / n ratio .",
    "the method incorporates the slice selection protocol in a standard  experiment . like a conventional  experiment ,",
    "a @xmath8 pulse is applied to invert the .",
    "as the  is relaxing back toward the equilibrium value , we observe different slices of the sample ( thickness is typically @xmath9 of the sample length ) at different times .",
    "a selection of 10 - 20 slices allow us to monitor the journey of  from an inverted state toward equilibrium , and to accurately calculate the 1  value .",
    "the basic framework of ssir is described in fig .",
    "[ twomethods]b .",
    "the figure also shows the standard  experiment ( fig .",
    "[ twomethods]a ) , so that a direct comparison can be made .",
    "the total time delay for @xmath10th slice in ssir , has been made equal to the @xmath10th time delay ( @xmath11 ) of the  experiment , such that a comparison between the experimental time taken by these two methods can be made . in ssir ( fig .",
    "[ twomethods]b ) the offset change at the beginning of a cycle is to select a particular slice at a specific frequency .",
    "this offset is incremented in each cycle to select slices .",
    "however , just before the acquisition , the offset is to reverted back to the original value for recording the spectrum , in the absence of a gradient .    from fig .",
    "[ twomethods ] , it is apparent that the total experimental time for standard inversion recovery experiment , @xmath12 , is given by , t_ir = n(d_1 + t_aq ) + _ i=1^n_i , where @xmath13 is the acquisition time .",
    "the time delay for @xmath10th scan is @xmath11 for  experiment . in case of ssir ,",
    "the time delay for @xmath10th slice is given by , _",
    "i = ( _ j=1^j = i_j^ ) + ( i-1)t_aq .",
    "it should be noted that in contrast to  experiment , the calculation of total experimental time for ssir , does not involve a summation over all @xmath14s .",
    "hence the total experimental time for ssir , @xmath15 , is , t_ssir = t_aq + _ n , where , @xmath16 is the time delay for nth or final slice .",
    "taking @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and for the  experiment assuming an average @xmath19 , one obtains , & & t_ir = n(5t_1+t_aq + t_1 ) , + & & t_ssir = t_aq + 3t_1 .",
    "assuming @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 being full - width at half - maximum of the concerned peak , we get , t_ssir = t_ir for @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "however for long 1 s , @xmath25 , yielding , t_ssir = .",
    "thus , the ssir method needs only a fraction of the time needed for the full ir method .",
    "both ssir and the conventional  experiment were performed on 4,5-dichloro-2-fluoro - nitrobenzene at 300 k dissolved in cdcl@xmath26 and sealed after several freeze pump and thaw cycles .",
    "the molecule has three weakly coupled spins ( fig .",
    "[ stack1]a ) .",
    "spectra of both protons @xmath27 ( ortho to fluorine ) and @xmath28 ( meta to fluorine ) , show doublets due to the coupling with fluorine , the coupling between the protons being small and unresolved .",
    "we have chosen this molecule , since the two protons have long relaxation times ( @xmath7 25 s and @xmath7 75 s respectively ) at 300 k. we have earlier observed strong longitudinal cross - correlation effects in this molecule @xcite . in the 1  measurements described below",
    ", the signal of each proton doublet was added up to suppress any multiplet effect due to cross - correlations @xcite .    for the ssir experiment a gradient of 3 g / cm",
    "was applied along the z - direction . the effective sample height ( the height of the r.f .",
    "coil ) was 25 mm , yielding the total spectral spread of approximately 30 khz ( at 500 mhz of proton frequency ) . from the central part of the sample",
    "17 slices of 100 hz width ( @xmath7 0.08 mm thick ) were selected with 500 hz distance between the slices corresponding to approximately 0.4 mm distance between the slices . to investigate the diffusion effects the ssir experiment was repeated with various slice distances .",
    "slice distances of 600 hz , 700 hz and 1000 hz were chosen which correspond to 0.47 mm , 0.50 mm and 0.79 mm respectively .",
    "it was assumed that the gradient profile is linear and flat in the region of interest .",
    "the result of standard ir method suffers from the effects of r.f .",
    "inhomogeneity , particularly when the sample height is longer than the r.f .",
    "coil height @xcite .",
    "methods have been suggested to correct the errors in 1  measurements arising due to the r.f .",
    "inhomogeneity effects @xcite . here ,",
    "we describe a method of obtaining 1 , free from r.f .",
    "inhomogeneity effects . in this experiment",
    "the magnetization of the entire sample is inverted using a hard 180@xmath2 pulse in the absence of gradient , and subsequently the magnetization of only the central slice is detected by using a soft 90@xmath2 pulse in the presence of a gradient .",
    "the experiment is repeated for several values of delay ( @xmath3 ) , each after a delay of 51 , exactly like in a standard ir experiment .",
    "the total experimental time is thus equal to the standard ir experiment , with the result being free from r.f .",
    "inhomogeneity effects .",
    "we name this experiment as ir@xmath29 .",
    "[ stack1 ] shows the comparison between the spectra obtained from standard inversion recovery experiment and from ssir for h@xmath30 proton .",
    "the h@xmath31 proton spectra ( not shown ) yield similar results .",
    "the 1  values obtained from these spectra are discussed in the next section .",
    "the data for the ir , ir@xmath29 and ssir experiments are plotted in fig .",
    "[ values ] for the h@xmath31 and h@xmath30 protons",
    ". results of mono exponential least square fit to these data are summarized in table [ comptable ] .",
    "it is seen from table [ comptable ] that the 1  values for all the three methods for the h@xmath31 proton are equal within experimental errors . for the h@xmath30 proton ,",
    "however , the ir method gave a slightly lower value .",
    "it is well known that the r.f .",
    "inhomogeneity causes errors in ir method and lowers the measured 1 .",
    "the ir@xmath29 method is thus superior to ir method .",
    "the ssir method results substantial saving in time without loss of accuracy in 1  measurement .",
    "the ssir results are also plotted on a logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "[ logplots ] . it is seen that for long values of @xmath3 ( @xmath32 for h@xmath30 ) the data show deviation from linearity .",
    "it was suspected that this is due to diffusion of saturation arising from the 90@xmath2 pulses to adjacent slices . to investigate this aspect , four ssir experiments with different slice separation (",
    "namely , 0.39 mm , 0.47 mm , 0.50 mm and 0.79 mm corresponding to 500 , 600 , 700 and 1000 hz ) were carried out .",
    "the slice thickness was kept constant to 0.08 mm corresponding to 100 hz .",
    "the results given in table [ comptable ] show a slight systematic increase in 1  values of the h@xmath30 proton ( within experimental errors ) with increased slice separation .",
    "it is thus concluded that the diffusion effects , if any , are small in the present sample .",
    "while the manuscript was under preparation , our attention was drawn to a paper accepted for publication in journal of magnetic resonance , by loening et al , which also describes an experiment similar to our ssir experiment and reports similar saving in experimental time @xcite .",
    "however they have measured smaller 1  ( 1  @xmath7 2 - 12 s ) .",
    "a fast method ( single scan inversion recovery , ssir in short ) for measuring the long  has been described .",
    "being a single scan experiment , ssir is order of magnitude faster than the conventional  method , without any significant loss in accuracy .",
    "the method relies on slice selection technique . after an initial inversion of the total magnetization of the sample ,",
    "different slices are observed at different times to monitor the complete relaxation recovery , in a single inversion .",
    "the effect of diffusion of saturation from one slice to next have been found to be small in this sample .",
