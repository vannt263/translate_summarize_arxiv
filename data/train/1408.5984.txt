    "broadly speaking , at fixed mass , the elliptical ` early type ' galaxies are older , redder , less likely to be star forming , and smaller than the ` late type ' spirals ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    ".      with the above as background , our immediate goal in this paper is to derive a quantitative , phenomenological description of the bivariate colour  mass distribution function for field galaxies in the local universe , with particular emphasis on the colour  mass relations ( cmrs ) and mass functions ( mfs ) for the redder and bluer of the galaxy subpopulations .",
    "in essence , our goals are similar to those of @xcite , who set out to quantitatively model the two apparently distinct but overlapping ` red ' and ` blue ' populations seen in the colour  magnitude plane . the colour  magnitude diagram is astronomy s most basic diagnostic plot . for galaxies , as a measure of the integrated starlight ,",
    "magnitude is typically taken as a proxy for total stellar content ; _ i.e. _ , stellar mass .",
    "colour is a simple observable diagnostic parameter that characterises galaxies stellar populations . in particular , modulo dust",
    ", colour acts as a proxy for the luminosity - weighted mean stellar age , which can also be taken as an average specific star formation rate ( sfr ) over long ( @xmath5 gyr ) timescales .",
    "our analysis improves on that of @xcite in two ways .",
    "first , we use the results of stellar population synthesis ( sps ) modelling of broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , rather than simple restframe luminosities and colours .",
    "specifically , we use sps - derived stellar mass estimates as our proxy for total stellar content , and we use dust - corrected intrinsic stellar colour as ( at least in principle ) a more direct tracer of galaxies stellar populations . second , we extend the @xcite analysis by developing and applying a statistically rigorous mixture modelling formalism to derive a quantitative , phenomenological description of the bimodality in galaxies stellar populations .",
    "the crux of the problem is that the ( optical ) colour distributions of the apparently distinct red and blue populations are seen to overlap . in the first instance",
    ", this presents an operational problem : how best to disentangle these two populations . in the second instance , the fact of overlap makes it difficult to interpret the terms ` red ' and ` blue ' in concrete , astrophysical terms .",
    "given the role that these kinds of observations have in guiding theories of galaxy formation and evolution , a secondary goal of this work is to elucidate some of the important conceptual subtleties and difficulties inherent to this kind of analysis , which are too often glossed over  if not ignored altogether .",
    "our discussion proceeds in four parts , as follows .",
    "the gama data and our basic analysis of them are laid out in and .",
    "we discuss our ability to meaningfully constrain dust obscurations and intrinsic stellar colours in and fig .",

    ", we show how and why previous studies have found qualitatively and quantitatively different results for the red / blue mfs : namely , the different  and almost always arbitrary ",
    "ways that the ` red ' and ` blue ' galaxy samples have been selected or defined .",
    "the extent to which these results provide meaningful constraints on the process of galaxy formation and evolution is therefore limited by the extent to which the terms ` red ' and ` blue ' can be shown to be astrophysically meaningful .",
    "this is why we have set out to derive objective and phenomenological , operational definitions for the terms ` red ' and ` blue ' .",
    "in addition to the description of our modelling procedure given in , we provide a more pedagogical discussion of our approach in appendix [ app : themodel ] , in which we develop our analysis starting from a simple @xmath6-minimisation fit . this material is intended to help fast - track researchers intending to apply a similar mixture - modelling analysis to their own data .",
    "the reader that is concerned about how we have decided to parameterise our fits to the bivariate colour  mass distributions should focus on .",

    "( in prep . ) . in comparison to the earlier ` apmatchedcatv01 ` catalogue presented by @xcite , the most significant change is the supersession of the ukidss las nir data with _",
    "_ data from vst viking .",
    "as is well known , the finite auto  aperture is prone to miss a significant amount of flux for galaxies that are faint and/or have significant low - surface brightness wings . to account for this",
    ", we characterise the total , observers frame @xmath19-band flux by fitting a srsic  profile to the observed 2d light distributions for each galaxy . as described by @xcite ,",
    "this has been done using galfit3 @xcite , incorporating a galaxy - specific model for the psf , and taking care to isolate and deblend the target from any and all nearby galaxies . in the fits",
    ", the srsic  profile has been truncated at 10 @xmath32 , which typically corresponds to a surface brightness limit of @xmath33 mag / @xmath34 . for this work",
    ", we have used these srsic - fit estimates of total @xmath19-band flux , taken from the ` sersiccatv09 ` catalogue , to normalise the auto  seds described above . at fixed srsic  index , the rms in the values of these corrections - to - total",
    "is of order 0.05 mag or less , even for the faintest apparent magnitudes .",
    "the redshifts and multiband photometry described above have been combined to estimate stellar population parameters including masses , restframe photometry , luminosity - weighted mean stellar ages , dust obscurations , metalliticies , specific star formation rates , etc .",
    "the basic procedure is the same for the gama - i masses presented by @xcite , but with one significant improvement . for gama - ii , each band is weighted such that the sps fits are done to a fixed _ restframe _ wavelength range of 300011000  , which corresponds roughly to restframe @xmath35@xmath36",
    ". between this change , and the change from the ukidss to the viking nir data , the large systematic errors in the sps fits discussed at length in @xcite have been reduced significantly in the @xmath37 , @xmath36 , and @xmath38 bands .",
    "this suggests that at least part of these problems were due to calibration errors in the ukidss data .",
    "the issues with the @xmath39 and @xmath40 band data persist , but at a lower level , which is why we have not pushed further into the restframe nir for the sps fits .    following standard practice , in the course of these fits , an arbitrary error floor is imposed on each photometric point by adding an additional uncertainty of 0.05 mag in quadrature to the catalogued photometric uncertainties .",
    "this decision is typically justified as providing protection against both errors and uncertainties in the relative or cross calibration of the photometry in different bands , as well as against template mismatch and/or aliasing errors in the sps fitting .",
    "given that these uncertainties are treated as being both random and independent , however , neither of these justifications are really well - founded . with the exception of the @xmath35-band photometry , the catalogued errors are almost always comparable to , or even less than , 0.05 mag .",
    "this imposed error floor is thus the limiting factor in setting the formal uncertainties on our sps - derived results including , in order of increasing importance , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , as we will argue in below , this decision leads to drastic overestimates of the ` true ' errors on the intrinsic ( _ i.e. _ , dust corrected ) stellar colours @xmath44 .",
    "the sed fitting process involves comparing the observed photometry to a library of synthetic stellar population spectra .",
    "this stellar population library ( spl ) was constructed using the @xcite stellar evolution models for a @xcite imf , and making the following common simplifying assumptions : 1 . )  exponentially declining star formation histories , 2.)uniform , single screen dust attenuation , and 3 . )",
    "uniform stellar metallicities .",
    "the estimates for both the values of and uncertainties in the sp parameters for individual galaxies have been made in a bayesian way .",
    "the rms difference between our values for @xmath45 and those from the mpa / jhu catalogues for sdss dr7 is @xmath46 dex , with no appreciable systematic differences as a function of colour , structure , mass , or apparent magnitude .",

    "in other words , _ current understanding of the mfs for the red and blue galaxy populations is limited by systematic errors_. as mentioned in the introduction , measurements of the mfs for the red and blue galaxy populations have played a pivotal role in informing our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it is therefore critically important to understand how and why there can be such large discrepancies between the results of these different analyses .",
    "only then will we be able to formulate an analytical approach that will allow us to robustly measure these quantities .",
    "given that there appears to be a better separation between the ` red ' and ` blue ' populations in the @xmath44 cmd shown in fig.s  [ fig : colours ] and [ fig : cmds ] , the natural question is whether the discrepancies described in the previous section can be alleviated or removed by focusing on intrinsic stellar colours / magnitudes .",
    "what happens if we try modifying these analyses to account for dust obscuration / extinction ?",
    "we address this question in * fig .",
    "[ fig : otherdust]*. the main difference between this figure and fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] is that we have now shifted to intrinsic ( _ i.e. _ , dust corrected ) stellar colours and luminosities , so as to more directly probe galaxies stellar populations .    as discussed in and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colours ] , the lowest values for the sed - fit dust extinctions is @xmath185 , even for galaxies with no h@xmath52 emission . in light of this fact",
    ", we need to also rescale each of the selection lines shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] .",
    "what we have done is to shift each selection line by the equivalent of @xmath186 mag .",
    "this ` correction ' is much larger than the expected dust obscuration for a canonically ` red and dead ' galaxy .",
    "it should be thought of as a conservative way to exclude the dustiest galaxies , while retaining those galaxies with genuinely ` red ' stellar populations .",
    "the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : otherdust ] shows the mfs for ` red ' and ` blue ' galaxies , selected in this way ; the selections themselves are shown in the upper panels .",
    "it is clear that adopting these selections would lead to a rather different picture of the makeup of the field galaxy population .",
    "comparing the range of values for the red mf that come from these different selections , the differences are at the level of a factor of @xmath187 .",
    "this is considerably larger than the differences seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] .",
    "that is , modifying these selections to account for dust _ exacerbates _ the tension between these different authors results , rather than alleviating it .",
    "( this implies that , even when looking at dust - corrected , intrinsic stellar colours , there is still substantial overlap between the ` blue ' and ` red ' populations .",
    "we will show in fig .",
    "[ fig : stardist ] , below , that this is indeed the case .",
    ") no less worrying is the size of discrepancy between the @xmath100 mfs for the @xmath44-selected ` red ' galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : otherdust ] ) and the @xmath41selected ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] ) .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , the size of this discrepancy is very sensitive to how much one chooses to shift each selection line  that is , how much dust to allow for in otherwise ` red sequence ' galaxies .",
    "so which of the six analyses we have now trialled is right ? are the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : otherdust ] any more or less reliable or meaningful than those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] ?",
    "the crux of the problem is that there are no clear theoretical grounds for preferring any one of these ` red'/`blue ' cuts over any other . in the absence of a solid , astrophysically meaningful argument for such a cut",
    ", this is necessarily true  without further information , we have no compelling way to answer this question .",
    "while we might offer some empirical or phenomenological argument in support of our specific cut , the point is that this decision will always be arguable ; that is , _ arbitrary_. this is a point that we will return to in and .",
    "for now , we can say with some confidence that these different results can be taken to approximately bracket the range of allowed values for the red / blue mfs that come from reasonable choices for hard - cut red / blue selections .",
    "the truth probably lies somewhere between the different results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] and fig .  [ fig : otherdust ] .",
    "this is not very satisfactory , however , as it means that the shapes of the red and blue mfs are not even well constrained _",
    "qualitatively _ , much less quantitatively .      in short :",
    "the quantitative _ and qualitative _ discrepancies between the results shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : otherdust ] are entirely due to the different ways that each set of ` red ' and ` blue ' samples has been selected  or , said another way , to the different operational definitions of the terms ` red ' and ` blue ' .",
    "for example , the fact that @xcite see an upturn to the red mass function at low masses  where @xcite and @xcite do not , despite their using essentially similar datasets , and even pushing to lower masses  is a direct consequence of the fact that the @xcite selection line is relatively bluer than earlier authors .",
    "it is therefore worth reflecting on the two implicit assumptions that underpin the use of a hard cut to separate ` red ' from ` blue ' galaxies , and thus the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : otherdust ] .",
    "first , it is presupposed that ` blueness ' and ` redness ' are physically meaningful designations , inasmuch as they encapsulate some fundamental distinction between the origins or natures of two distinct kinds of galaxies .",
    "the second , and more problematic , assumption is that there is something special  something astrophysically meaningful  about the particular boundary used to separate the two galaxy classes .",
    "the methodological appeal of such an approach is that it is well - defined , inasmuch as the hard cut can be written _",
    "explicitly _ and _ exactly _ , which makes such analyses easily reproducible . in the early days of the sdss , the astronomical motivation was also clear .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and many others had shown that there is substantial ( but not total ) overlap between a ` red sequence ' sample and an ` early type ' sample selected on the basis of srsic  index . in this way ,",
    "` redness ' and ` blueness ' were thought of as indirect proxies for structure , and thus for morphology . as was common at the time , @xcite , @xcite and others presented their mass function determinations for ` red ' and ` blue ' galaxies in terms of the hubble early- and late - type classifications .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , have phrased their results in terms of ` star - forming ' and ` quiescent ' galaxies .",
    "( this is also the explicit goal of , for example , some colour  colour selections , which are discussed further in . )    here again , we caution against this conflation of terminology when interpreting these results . while ` early type ' samples selected on the basis of colour , spectral type , morphology , and structure are often treated as if they are interchangeable , it is now becoming clear that _ they are not_. this point , and its importance , have most recently been forcefully made by @xcite , who consider the cmds for morphologically classified ` early- ' and ` late - types ' .",
    "further , the use of a hard cut overlooks the empirical fact of scatter around each of the distinct cmrs for the ` red ' and ` blue ' populations , however they are defined .",
    "any number of authors have shown that , at fixed magnitude or mass , the distribution of galaxies ( optical ) colours can be well described as the sum of two gaussians , and that the separation and widths of these two gaussian distributions are such that there is considerable overlap between the two ( see , _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considering these two distributions as arising from two distinct populations , the implication is that the use of a hard red / blue cut will yield samples that are both incomplete , and contaminated ( see also , _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "we will return to this issue towards the end of this paper , in .      in light of the above",
    ", we will not take quite so simple a view .",
    "we will assume that there _ is _ some meaningful astrophysical distinction to be made between the two populations : that there is some unknown astrophysical process that acts to determine whether any given galaxy is a member of either the ` blue ' or the ` red ' population .",
    "that is , _ we will assume that there are two distinct cmrs . _ but we will also allow that some ` hidden ' parameter ( or parameters ) mean that , at fixed mass , there are a range of colours among the members of each of the two populations , to the extent that these two distinct populations are observed to overlap in the cmd . that is , _ we will assume that there is some intrinsic scatter around each of the two cmrs .",
    "_    adopting this ( non - controversial ) view of two overlapping populations , the conceptual difficulty that arises is that some members of the ` blue ' population will have quantitatively redder @xmath41 or @xmath44 colours than some members of the ` red ' population .",
    "further , two galaxies might have identical values of @xmath50 and @xmath41 , but one might ` really ' belong to the ` blue ' population , and the other to the ` red ' one . without further information , it would be impossible to unambiguously determine which is which .",
    "this means that any ` red'/`blue ' classification of individual galaxies can only be done probabilistically , in terms of the odds that that galaxy has been drawn from either the ` red ' or the ` blue ' population .",
    "while our approach brings these conceptual quandaries into sharp focus , we stress that similar criticisms can be levelled at the simple , binary ` blue'/`red ' distinction used above : the inferred scatter around the cmrs derived for the hard - cut ` blue ' and ` red ' populations leads to precisely the same conundrum .    without solid astrophysical justification ,",
    "the terms ` blue ' and ` red ' must be understood to be defined _ operationally _ , and as such are useful only as _ qualitative _ descriptors . in acknowledgement of this point",
    ", we will from now on abandon the terms ` blue ' and ` red ' as classifiers , and instead use the more generic idea of a b- and an r - population .",
    "note that these descriptors do not properly apply to individual _ galaxies _ , but instead to distinct _",
    "populations of galaxies_.    obviously , the designations b and r have been chosen with a nod towards one being for the bluer population , and the other for the redder one .",
    "but we want to be absolutely clear that these designations are based on _ phenomenological _ descriptions of the joint colour - magnitude distributions and should not be taken to be rigorously grounded in astrophysical theory .",
    "astrophysical _ interpretation of our descriptive b- and r- population modelling , including those offered in , must be done with care .",
    "let us stress in particular that we are _ not explicitly _ trying to select galaxies that are quiescent , quenched , early - type , etc .",
    "our explicit goal here is _ only _ to distinguish between the generic ` developed ' and the ` developing ' galaxy populations on the basis of their stellar populations . in this sense , all that the b and r designations are intended to encapsulate are the distributions of luminosity weighted mean stellar ages , as probed by either @xmath41 or @xmath44 .",
    "of course , at least for moderate- to high - masses ( @xmath188 ) , it turns out that the galaxies that comprise the r population largely conform to the prevalent notion of ` red and dead ' or ` quenched ' ( see , as well as fig .",
    "[ fig : colours ] ) .",
    "this being the case , our results _ can _ be used to gain insight on the process of quenching , but _ only insofar as our operational definition of ` red'- or ` r'-ness can be taken to mean ` quenched'_.    while our approach brings this issue into sharp focus , the same degree of caution is merited when interpreting the results of past studies of ` blue ' and ` red ' galaxies : bearing in mind the qualitative and quantitative discrepancies between the results shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : others ] or fig .",
    "[ fig : otherdust ] , which of the selections shown in these figures can be said to best represent the idea of ` quenched ' ?",
    "adopting the working hypothesis of two distinct but overlapping b- and r - populations in the cmd , the question becomes technical : how best to distinguish and characterise the two populations on the basis of the observed cmd .",
    "while the designations ` b ' and ` r ' must be understood to be qualitative , inasmuch as they are phenomenological , we want to be able to classify galaxies _ quantitatively_. this can be done probabilistically , according to the chances that they are members of either the b or r population .",
    "further , we want these classifications to be _",
    "objective_. in order to achieve these goals , it is necessary to describe or otherwise account for the actual underlying colour distributions , including the degree of overlap , and as a function of mass .",
    "this is therefore the task that we have undertaken .",
    "this section is devoted to describing and validating our descriptive modelling of the bivariate or joint @xmath41 and @xmath44 colour  mass distributions for field galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "the most general form of our model is laid out in , including definitions and descriptions of the 40 parameters that define the model in its most general form . in",
    ", we describe the numerical methods that have been used to fit for the free parameters . in",
    ", we describe the process by which we have selected the best and simplest description of the data from within the more general family of models that we have considered .",
    "( for the more motivated reader , we present a pedagogical development of the model in appendix [ app : themodel ] , in which we build up our formalism as successive generalisations of the conventional weighted-@xmath6 approach to fitting a single line . )    the conceptual basis of our descriptive modelling is this : that the observed data are a sampling of some ` true ' , astrophysical , bivariate colour  mass distribution .",
    "this being the case , our data can be seen to have been drawn from  generated by  some 2d probability distribution function , @xmath189 , where @xmath190 denotes some generic location in our 2d data plane .",
    "( in this section , we will thus use @xmath12 and @xmath64 to further abbreviate the quantities @xmath42 and either @xmath41 or @xmath44 . )",
    "we can not absolutely know the `",

    "so instead , we aim to construct a parametric description for what @xmath189 might be , and use the data to constrain the possible and even likely form of @xmath189 .",
    "let us denote the full set of parameters used or required to describe @xmath189 as @xmath191 .    assume for a moment that we know or can guess the correct form of @xmath192 .",
    "naturally , one does not observe this distribution directly . instead ,",
    "observational errors mean that the observed distribution in the @xmath193 plane will be a smeared out version of the true distribution .",
    "let us also assume that that the observational errors / uncertainties for a given data point , @xmath194 , are gaussian , and so can be described by the covariance matrix @xmath77 ( see equations [ eq : rho][eq : covar ] ) .",
    "using @xmath195 as shorthand for a bivariate gaussian , the likelihood of observing a particular datum @xmath196 is then given by the convolution of the ` true ' , underlying distribution and the bivariate gaussian that describes that measurement , and its associated uncertainty ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath197 note that to satisfy the requirement that a point actually be observed , we impose to the normalisation conditions that the integral over ( @xmath198 ) space for @xmath199 and @xmath200 , and hence @xmath201 , be equal to one .",
    "it is crucial to recognise that the value of @xmath199 , and thus the value of @xmath201 , can only be computed  indeed , are only defined  given an assumed or trial set of values for each and every of the parameters in @xmath191 . in recognition of this fact",
    ", these quantities have been written in and all that follows as @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "the crux of the problem is then to construct an appropriate parametric description of @xmath192 .",
    "that is our task in this section . at this stage ,",
    "the casual or credulous reader whose interest lies only in our results may wish to skip these technical sections , and move directly to , in which we demonstrate the quality of our fits to the observed bivariate @xmath41 and @xmath44@xmath50 distributions .      in order to accommodate the apparent bimodality in the @xmath41 and @xmath44 cmds , we split the model for the ` true ' , astrophysical bivariate colour",

    "note that , in line with the probabilistic nature of this generative model , all of @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath211 should be understood to be integral normalised to one .",

    "each of these aspects of the model are described in turn below .",

    "amplitudes are modulated by the continuous dual - schechter mass function , @xmath15 , defined in . in ,",
    "@xmath15 is thus accompanied by the kronecker delta function , @xmath223 , and the underlying models @xmath189 can be seen to be constructed as the sum of many discrete components evaluated at @xmath224 .",
    "the reason for this decision is to allow the convolutions in eq.s ( [ eq : elli ] ) , ( [ eq : model ] ) , and ( [ eq : bad ] ) to be done analytically .",
    "our method can be seen as evaluating an approximate model , which has a discretised mass function , in an exact , analytical way .",

    "spaced grid in @xmath12 with a spacing of 0.05 dex , with grid edges running from our nominal mass limit of 8.7 up to 12 . with this grid spacing ,",
    "the typical galaxy with a mass uncertainty @xmath227 dex has 5 or 6 @xmath225s within its fwhm .",
    "the normalised mass functions for the b and r components , @xmath228 and @xmath229 , respectively , are described using the sum of two @xcite functions : @xmath230 here , the parameter @xmath231 can be understood to govern the relative normalisations of the @xmath232s by describing the relative number of galaxies the make up the second of the two schechter functions , and the shapes of the two schechter functions , @xmath233 , are described by a low - mass power law with logarithmic slope , @xmath52 , and a characteristic mass , @xmath234 , which describes the ` knee ' of the mass function .",
    "thus we have up to 5 parameters for each of the b and r populations , plus the dimensionless parameter @xmath212 defined above , for a total of 11 parameters to describe the full mass distribution of galaxies , down to our selection limit .",
    "again , each of @xmath15 , @xmath235 , and @xmath236 should be understood to be integral normalised to unity ( given our @xmath237 and @xmath0 selections ) .",
    "we must therefore estimate the global normalisation of the mass function independently of the modelling described in this section .",
    "this has been done after the modelling on the basis of the integrated mass density among galaxies in our sample ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath238 mpc@xmath239 .",
    "this step introduces a @xmath240% systematic uncertainty into all of our fit mass functions ( but not the observed ones ) . with",
    "this value fixed , we can compute the values of the usual characteristic densities , @xmath241 , in units of mpc@xmath239 dex@xmath242 , based on the values of all 11 of the mf - defining parameters . when we give the values of the fit parameters in fig .",

    "there is a smooth transition from a low - mass regime , in which the cmr goes like @xmath250 , to a high - mass regime where the cmr goes like @xmath251 .",
    "we highlight two special cases : first , if @xmath252 , then this parameterisation is equivalent to the line - plus - tanh parameterisation used by @xcite ; second , if @xmath253 , then we have a smooth transition around the point of intersection between two lines .",
    "the parameter @xmath254 defines precisely where the transition takes place , and the parameter @xmath255 governs how sharp / smooth this transition is .",
    "thus we have six parameters to describe each of the red and blue cmrs , bringing our running total of fit parameters to 23 .",

    "our generative model includes a parametric description for ` bad ' data . to this end , we split the model into two components ; one for each of the ` good ' and ` bad ' data distributions : @xmath258 here , the parameter @xmath259 describes the fraction of datapoints encompassed within the ` bad ' distribution .",

    "first , what exactly is meant by ` bad ' ? before , we have distinguished the b and r components as having different cmrs as well as different mass function .",
    "by contrast , the ` bad ' distribution can thus be seen to be just a ` poor copy ' of the ` good ' , r  plus  b distribution , having been ` smeared ' with a large gaussian , and with a much lower relative normalisation .",
    "essentially , we are using these ` bad ' quantities to parameterise our ignorance of any and all features in the observed cmds that are not easily explained by the ` good ' model .",
    "this includes catastrophic errors in the measurements of either @xmath12 or @xmath64 , but also includes  at least in principle  any additional components in the true , astrophysical , joint colour  mass distribution .",
    "given this , what justification is there for treating the distribution of ` bad ' data as gaussian ? in short , there is none .",
    "that said , we stress that our characterisation of the ` bad ' data is simply in terms of the rms of ` bad ' data points around the ` true ' cmrs .",
    "it is true that the link between the value of @xmath265 and the true shape of the distribution of ` bad ' data in @xmath257 space does implicitly assume gaussianity .",
    "but we have no interest in accurately modelling the shape of this distribution ; for the purposes of objectively identifying and censoring such ` bad ' data , simply knowing ( or , better , modelling ) the rms scatter is sufficient .",
    "further , we are not even really that interested in the precise values of the parameters @xmath259 and @xmath265 : what we are interested in using these parameters to limit the influence of outliers on the fit values of all the other , more astrophysically meaningful parameters . that being the case , when we come to reporting our results we will marginalise over the values of both of these nuisance parameters ( see below ) , leaving us only with the parameters of genuine interest and importance .",
    "readers that remain concerned about the role of these parameters in our calculation are referred to our more detailed discussion in , and also to the excellent primer on data fitting by @xcite .      in summary ,",
    "eq.s ( [ eq : elli][eq : zeta ] ) define a model for the distribution of galaxies in the cmd , which is fully described by up to 40 parameters .",

    "we have used the publicly available python package emcee  @xcite to actually perform the mcmc fits presented in this work .",

    "our tests have been systematic , but by no means exhaustive .",
    "as described below , we have used these tests to ensure that we are not grossly overfitting the data .",
    "there are a number of bayesian approaches to the problem of model selection which we have explored : the bayes factor , @xmath40 , the closely related akaike and bayesian information criteria ( aic and bic , respectively ) , and the deviance information criterion ( dic ) .",
    "while these different approaches are each based on slightly different assumptions , and are thus strictly valid in slightly different circumstances , they can all be thought of as being similar in spirit to a traditional frequentist log - likelihood - ratio test . in asymptotic limits , aic @xmath86 bic @xmath86 dic @xmath312 .",
    "a difference of 2.5 ( or 10 ) in the ic of two different models implies a likelihood ratio of @xmath86 3.5 ( or 150 ) , where the model with the lower value for the ic is the preferred one .",
    "however , unlike a simple likelihood ratio test , each of these quantities includes an explicit or implicit penalty for larger numbers of parameters , so as to protect against over - fitting of the data .",
    "we have focussed primarily on the aic and bic , which are defined with reference to the maximum of the likelihood function , @xmath313 .",
    "is scaled by a factor @xmath314 .",
    "a lower @xmath315 makes steps to lower values of @xmath316 harder than they would otherwise , effectively corralling the mcmc walkers where @xmath316 is high .",
    "it is thus possible to robustly determine the value of @xmath313 by successively reducing the value of @xmath315 . ] since extra parameters can only increase the value of @xmath313 , the question is whether or not this improvement is sufficient to merit the inclusion of an extra parameter .",
    "the penalty terms for additional parameters for the aic and bic are @xmath317 and @xmath318 , respectively , where @xmath109 is the number of free parameters in the model , and @xmath319 is the number of data points .",
    "thus it can be seen that , all else being equal , the bic penalises additional parameters more strongly than the aic for @xmath320 .",
    "( in our case , @xmath321 , so the bic penalty is roughly 5 times larger . )    in other words , the bic prefers models with fewer parameters .",
    "thus , where the bic disfavours a simpler model , this model is definitely too simple , and should not be used .",
    "conversely , the aic prefers models with more parameters .",
    "where the aic disfavours a model with more parameters , then that the use of that model is definitely overfitting the data .    in order to ensure that we are not abusing our data",
    ", we have used these two information criteria to explore the consequences of omitting individual parameters from the model described above .",
    "given the number of parameters that go into our general model in its most general form , it is impractical to do this in a properly exhaustive way . instead ,",
    "starting from the most general form of our model , we have considered omitting individual parameters one at a time to see whether or how our model might be simplified .",
    "first , we have tried successively omitting the parameters @xmath322 , @xmath323 , @xmath19 , and @xmath324 ( _ i.e. _ , the parameters that describe the step or bend in the locus of or scatter around the cmrs ) . when fitting to the @xmath41 cmd , it is possible that a simpler description of the b cmr is possible : omitting the parameters @xmath325 and @xmath326 improves both information criteria by 8 and by 10 , respectively . while this constitutes positive statistical evidence against the need for one of these parameters , it is ambiguous which one should be excluded .",
    "when fitting to the @xmath44 cmd , the results are similar . based on the bic , it is preferable to omit either @xmath327 or @xmath328 ( but not both ) , and also possibly and @xmath326 and @xmath329 ( @xmath330bic = 8 for both ) .",
    "the ambiguity in these results make perfect sense looking at the table of results given in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcmc ] . these parameters which may or may not be necessary are those whose fit values are statistically consistent with being zero .",
    "their inclusion or exclusion thus makes little if any difference to the fits , and the decision as to whether or not to include these parameters has no practical consequences .",
    "we therefore elect to use the most general description possible for the locii of and scatters around the cmrs , by fitting for all of these parameters . in this sense , our results",
    "can be thought of as hypothesis testing the need for each of the @xmath322s , @xmath323s , @xmath19s and @xmath324s .",
    "where the fit values for any of these parameters are consistent with zero , then that parameter may be unnecessary for a good description of the data .",
    "these results nonetheless encapsulate positive information about the forms of locii of and scatters around the b and r cmrs .",
    "perhaps more interesting is what happens when we trial alternate descriptions of the mfs . as well as the general double schechter parameterisation",
    ", we have trialled a coupled twin - schechter description , where the two schechter functions that describe either the r or b population have the same characteristic mass ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath331 ) .",
    "we have also trialled using only a single schechter function ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath332 .    when fitting to the @xmath41 cmd , the bic definitely disfavours a single schechter function description for the b mf ( @xmath330bic @xmath333 ) , indicating that such a model definitely underfits the data .",
    "the bic also definitely disfavours the coupled , twin schechter function description for the b mf ; the data definitely prefer a double schechter function description of the b mf , with @xmath334 . at the other extreme",
    ", the aic disfavours the most general , double schechter model ( @xmath330aic @xmath335 ; odds @xmath86 20:1 ) for the r mf described .",
    "that said , it is worth noting that both the aic and bic ( weakly ) prefer a single schechter description for the r mf .",
    "this may not be surprising , given how weakly constrained the values of @xmath336 , and @xmath337 are .",
    "when fitting to the @xmath44 cmd , the bic disfavours a single schechter mf for the r population ( @xmath330bic @xmath338 ) .",
    "the bic does not obviously prefer the more complicated , independent double schechter descriptions of either the b or r mfs ; the coupled , twin schechter functions are just as good .",
    "the variation of the model that best balances between the two criteria is the one that uses coupled , twin schechter functions to describe both the b and the r mf .    in light of all of the above",
    ", we will continue our analysis using the most general form for our model , which is fully defined by 40 parameters .",
    "this is despite the fact that both the aic and bic prefer a single schechter description for the r mf when analysing the @xmath41 cmd .",
    "( but of course , this being the case , the fits do not make use of the additional freedom that the second schechter component provides , precisely because it is not necessary for a good description of the data . ) in this sense , our fit results can be taken as limiting the deviations from schechter - ness in the observed mf for r type galaxies .    for all of the rest",
    ", we can say that we are not definitely overfitting the data , nor are we definitely underfitting the data . beyond this point",
    ", however , all we can say is that we have done the best that we know how ( and monopolised 64 cores for more than 2 months ) to ensure that we are using the best and simplest model that we can to describe the existing data .      in some of the above",
    ", there is some ambiguity , inasmuch as the data do not provide strong evidence for or against the inclusion of some parameters .",
    "this is particularly true for whether or how the b and r mfs should be described with a combination of schechter functions . to the extent that there is ambiguity , our decisions about whether or not to include these parameters are subjective , hence _",
    "arbitrary_.    to the extent that these points are ambiguous , however , they are also _ unimportant_. this is true in the sense that these decisions have no strong impact on the statistical quality of the fits to the data .",
    "this is also true in the sense that the best fit models based on the less - general parameterisations provide essentially identical results .",
    "what we have done in the above is to explore special cases or restricted classes of the general form of our model .",
    "the question that naturally arises is whether there are some alternative parameterisation might provide a better description of the data .",
    "for instance , it could be that a lorentzian or a student s @xmath339 or a skewed gaussian description of the scatter around the cmrs yields a better statistical description of the data .",
    "of course , a properly exhaustive search of all conceivable models is impossible .. remarkably though , using a fifth order ( _ i.e. _ , six parameter ) polynomial description for @xmath215 , we obtain virtually identical results : the differences in the fit values of @xmath340 are nowhere more than 0.01 mag , and the ic is only slightly worse . ]",
    "this brings us to the final and most important caveat on our results . while the formal statistical uncertainties on our cmr and mf fits are impressively small , the values themselves _ can not but _ be determined by the decisions made in constructing the parameterised , descriptive model that has been used . on the other hand",
    ", the same criticism can be levelled at _ any _ model or modeller  even a fully physically - minded explanatory model is forced to presuppose the validity of the theoretical framework on which it is based . at this level ,",
    "some degree of subjectivity is inescapable .",
    "once we have set the parametric form of our descriptive model , however , it is then left to the data to decide on the particular parameter values that provide the best description , including all the characteristics of the b- and r- populations .",
    "that is , given our choice of parameterisation , it is the data themselves that define the bimodal distributions .",
    "the results of this modelling thus provide objective b / r classifications _ insofar as objectivity is possible_. these results can thus be said to provide an accurate , reliable , and robust phenomenological description of the observed data  and this is all that we have set out to obtain .",

    "illustrative statistical uncertainties in the observed colour distributions are shown by the black error bars .",
    "these uncertainties have been estimated using bootstrap resampling .",

    "further , even for the lowest @xmath341 bin , the statistics are reasonably good . particularly for @xmath344 , then , there should be no question as to whether or not the data are good enough to allow an independent double - gaussian ( or some other parametric ) fit to any or all of the individual , mass - binned colour distributions .",
    "the smooth curves in fig .  [ fig : rfdist ] and fig .  [ fig : stardist ] show the results of our descriptive modelling of the bivariate @xmath41 and @xmath44 colour - mass distributions .",
    "the red and blue curves show the distinct r and b components of the model ; the black curve is the total , r  plus  b distribution .",
    "note that for these illustrative purposes , we have convolved the modelled colour - distributions with typical @xmath41 or @xmath44 uncertainties for each mass bin , so that these curves are directly comparable to histograms for the observed data .    before moving on , let us stress that we have _ not _ binned the data in the course of fitting it : the binning in mass and colour in these figures is for illustrative purposes only .",
    "further , nowhere in the modelling is it ever specified  or even relevant  whether any particular galaxy belongs to either the r or the b populations ; there is no binning in this sense either .",

    "[ fig : rfdist ] and fig .",

    "how then should one interpret our results at these low masses ?    considering this problem from the modelling perspective , we should ask what aspects of the data drive the fits most strongly . clearly , it is the shape and normalisation of the b colour distributions that are the best constrained at these low masses .",
    "also , from the nature of the fits , it should be clear that the fits to the b colour distributions are decided primarily by the @xmath347 or @xmath348 data .",
    "bluewards of the peak of the observed colour distributions , the data are well described by a gaussian .",
    "then , since the colour distributions for each population are assumed to be symmetric , it is left to the r population to accommodate whatever asymmetries there are in the observed colour distributions .    from a more astrophysical perspective , then , what matters is the extent to which the colour distribution for the b population is expected to be symmetric . however , this will certainly not be the case for @xmath41 , where the asymmetric effect of dust is expected to skew the b colour distribution to the red . in this case",
    ", one would expect the inferred number of r galaxies to absorb some of the reddest b - type galaxies .",
    "indeed , looking at the lowest two or three bins of fig .",
    "[ fig : rfdist ] , one can see immediately how such a description might work .    rather than trying to fit for an asymmetric or skewed @xmath41 distribution ( which would be considerably computationally more complicated )",
    ", we can look at the @xmath44 distribution , where we have tried to remove dust as a complicating factor . but looking at the lower three bins in fig .",
    "[ fig : stardist ] , there is no way to decide whether the slight asymmetry of the observed colour distribution ought to be interpreted as an indication of a separate population , or instead as nothing more than a slight asymmetry in the @xmath44 colour distribution of the b population .",
    "our conclusion is therefore that at these low masses , the ( field ) red sequence dissolves into obscurity  we no longer see clear evidence of two distinct populations in the @xmath41 or @xmath44 colour distributions for @xmath349 .",
    "( as we have argued in , we do not believe that the apparent dearth of low mass red galaxies is due to incompleteness . ) instead , we present our inferred mfs for r - type galaxies as _ an upper limit _ on the number densities of galaxies that have moved ( or are moving ) away from the colour distribution that describes most low - mass galaxies ; _ i.e. _ , the b population .    again , the fact that the inferred b- and r- populations have substantial overlap serves to underline the subtleties involved in interpreting our results in concrete , astrophysical terms .",
    "in particular , even at intermediate masses , it would be unwise to blithely equate the r population with ` quenched'but recognise how much more problematic it is to apply the term ` quenched ' to the hard - cut ` red ' samples discussed in .      to sum up : using the parametric model described in , we have derived a very good description of the observed bivariate distributions between both @xmath41 and @xmath44 and stellar mass .",

    "this behaviour can be understood in terms of mergers among ` red and dead ' galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : by the central limit theorem , the mixing of stellar populations in the individual merger products leads to convergence towards the mean colour for the population as a whole .",
    "it is interesting that the flattening and focussing of the r cmr apparently begin at around @xmath394 , whereas major mergers are thought to be most prevalent at slightly higher masses ( @xmath395 ) ; see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    "( note that this qualitative statement is at worst weakly dependent on how well we understand the observational errors on the values of @xmath44 for individual galaxies . )",
    "coupled with the apparent dearth of genuinely ` red and dead ' galaxies with @xmath396 , this implies that the ongoing evolution of r - type galaxies must proceed in such a way as to create or preserve the relation between stellar mass and stellar population .",
    "this would seem to go against the idea that ( at least at these masses and redshifts , and outside of the richest clusters ) galaxies move on to the ` dead sequence ' rapidly and stochastically .    6 . )  in the @xmath44 cmd , the cmr for the b population ( _ i.e. _ , the blue sequence ) is relatively shallow and very nearly linear for @xmath371 .",
    "this implies that the slope seen in the @xmath41 cmd reflects greater dust attenuation in higher mass galaxies , as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : colours ] .",
    "further , the relatively shallow slope of the @xmath44 cmr implies an approximate self - similarity in the stellar populations of b - type galaxies with @xmath397 .",
    "the relatively small and constant scatter around the relation in this mass range strengthens this idea .",
    "together , these results suggest , albeit weakly , that the process of star formation  or at least stellar assembly  proceeds in a roughly self - similar fashion among the moderate - to - low mass b population .    7 . )",
    "when we fit to the @xmath41 cmd , the cmrs for the b and the r population appear to converge for @xmath356 .",
    "this mass range coincides with where there may be a slight upturn to the b cmr in the @xmath44 cmd , and with the knee in the overall field galaxy mass function .",
    "while it must be stressed that this is where the statistics for b - type galaxies becomes poor , this hints that these very massive b - type galaxies may be qualitatively different from their lower mass cousins , in that they have rather redder stellar populations , while still having significant amounts of dust .",
    "one possible interpretation is that these b - type galaxies with @xmath398 are well on their way to joining the r population .",
    "an alternative is that some recent event ( _ e.g. _ , a merger event ) has briefly rejuvenated the stellar populations and dust content of these massive galaxies , perturbing them out of the main r population .",
    "either way , the implication is that the apparent self - similarity among b - type galaxies breaks down at the highest masses .",

    "our final task is to compare our results to the existing results introduced in .",
    "our discussion is based on * fig .",
    "[ fig : punchline]*. the basic point that we are trying to elucidate with this figure is how our b / r - type classifications compare to the hard blue / red selection cuts employed or advocated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and how these different operational definitions for ` blue ' and ` red ' lead to very different quantitative results and qualitative conclusions .",
    "let us begin with a general description of what is shown in the different panels .",
    "as in fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] , the top panels reproduce the colour - magnitude and colour - mass diagrams used by these authors to define their blue and red samples . in these panels ,",
    "the filled coloured contours show how the fraction of r - type galaxies ( as inferred from our fits to the @xmath44 cmd ) varies across the different colour - magnitude and colour - mass diagrams .",
    "these values have been obtained by 1/@xmath103-weighted averaging of the values of @xmath399that is , the objective b / r - type classifier defined and discussed in in bins of colour and magnitude / mass .",
    "in essence , if we were to observe many galaxies with the same or similar colour and magnitude / mass , the contours thus show what fraction of these galaxies we would expect to be members of the r population .",
    "each of these cuts falls slightly blueward of the point where the r - type fraction is 50% , which is shown by the heavy green line .",
    "unsurprisingly , there is a rather broad range of colours where there is substantial overlap between the b- and r - populations ( @xmath400 ) in each of these diagrams .",
    "as we alluded in , this means that the different ` blue ' and ` red ' samples selected / defined by these different hard cuts will comprise a mix of both r- and b - type galaxies , in different proportions . as a means of selecting r- and b - type galaxies , these red and blue samples",
    "will all be both incomplete and contaminated .",
    "further , the relative proportions of r and b galaxies in each sample_i.e . _ , the degree of completeness / contamination  will be a strong function of mass , and will be sensitive to the precise cut used .    this is quantified in the middle row of fig .  [",
    "fig : punchline ] . we can define a kind of quasi - completeness , @xmath401 , for each of the red selections by looking at the relative numbers of r - type galaxies that satisfy each of the different red selections .",
    "this is simply derived as @xmath402 , where the sum is over all galaxies satisfying the red selection , and similarly for @xmath403 .",
    "( note that here , we are using the subscripts ` blue ' and ` red ' to denote the hard - cut samples , as distinct from our overlapping ` b ' and ` r ' populations . )",
    "similarly , we can define a quasi - reliability , @xmath404 , for each red selection as @xmath405 , and similarly for @xmath406 .",
    "the completeness of each of the three different red and blue selections , so defined , are shown as a function of mass by the solid lines in the middle panels .",
    "we also show the degree of contamination , ( @xmath407 ) , as the dashed lines .",
    "this same information is re - presented in a different form in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] , which also serves to illustrate and elucidate how these effects lead to qualitatively and quantitatively different determinations of the red and blue , or r- and b - type , mfs . in each panel , the histograms with errors show our determinations of the r- and b - type mfs , @xmath218 and @xmath217 , reproduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : starmf ] ; these are the same in each panel .",
    "then , the solid lines show the fit mfs , @xmath408 and @xmath409 , from each of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "note that for the purposes of this figure , we have renormalised the literature mfs to match the integrated number density for the gama sample , in order to focus on differences in the _ shapes _ of the b / r and the blue / red mfs .    in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] , the points show the absolute numbers of b- or r - type galaxies that are ` correctly ' selected as being blue or red ; in other words , these are the galaxies that we can all agree on",
    ". these values are equivalent to @xmath410 and @xmath411 .",
    "the difference between the points and the histograms thus reflects the effect of ` incompleteness ' in the blue / red samples selected using a hard cut .",
    "similarly , the difference between the points and the curves show the impact of ` contamination ' in the hard - cut samples .",
    "having now described the content of fig .",
    "[ fig : punchline ] in general terms , let us now turn to discussing the results of each of these three works in the context of our more sophisticated analysis",
    ".      looking at the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : others ] , it can be seen that our b mf agrees well with the blue mf from @xcite for @xmath412 . but",
    "this agreement is at least partly coincidental . at these masses , compared to our b - classifications , the @xcite blue cuts are 8090% complete , and 8090% reliable .",
    "the red cuts , on the other hand , are only 50 - 60% complete , and only 4060% reliable .",
    "it turns out that these two effects offset one another : the extra 10 - 20% of b - type galaxies that are counted as red almost exactly balances the 50% of r - type galaxies that are missed . in the context of our results , @xcite thus get the ` right ' answer for the @xmath413 red / blue mfs , but not necessarily for the ` right ' reasons : even where our mfs are similar , they are counting very different galaxies .    at higher masses , there are large discrepancies between our mfs and those of @xcite .",
    "many of what we call ` b - type ' galaxies are counted by @xcite as being ` red ' : the quasi - completeness of the @xcite selection drops rather smoothly from @xmath5 75% at @xmath414 to @xmath415% for @xmath416 .",
    "this means that , even though the red selection is @xmath417% reliable , it is also contaminated by b - type galaxies at the 2030% level .",
    "the obvious culprit here is dust , and specifically the dust - induced upturn in the @xmath41 cmr for the b population , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rfcmr ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : rffrac ] .",
    "the net effect of these effects is to inflate the red mf by a factor of @xmath418 , and to depress the blue mf by a factor of @xmath419 . in light of all this , the fact that the @xcite red / blue mfs can each be well described by a single schechter function is somewhat coincidental .",
    "the @xcite determinations of the red and blue mfs are based on similar assumptions to the ones that we have made .",
    "these authors have used an _ ad hoc _ iterative procedure to fit simultaneously for the centres of and scatters around the blue / red cmrs , as well as the mfs . compared to our analysis ,",
    "the major differences are : 1 . )",
    "that their fits are to the @xmath420@xmath421 colour  magnitude diagram , rather than the @xmath44@xmath73 cmd ; 2 . )",
    "that in their analysis , they bin the data first by magnitude , and then by colour , and fit to these binned distributions ; and 3 . )",
    "that they then rescale their values for each magnitude bin to stellar mass , using a simple relation between @xmath420 and @xmath422 , whereas we are explicitly working with @xmath50 estimates from sps modelling of optical seds .",
    "given the general similarities in , and important differences between , the two approaches , it is extremely encouraging that there is such good agreement between the b and r mfs that we derive , and those from @xcite  at least at the high - mass end .",
    "there are still rather large differences between the red mf from @xcite and the r mf that we derive from the @xmath44 cmd , but we note that the results based on the @xmath41 cmd are in rather better agreement .    the cut shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : punchline ] has been derived by @xcite on the basis of their fits .",
    "this cut is designed to maximise the product ( @xmath423 ) in @xmath420@xmath421 space . in this sense",
    ", it is designed to be an optimal hard - cut blue / red selection line ( given the specific tanh parameterisation used ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : punchline ] , it can be seen that this optimal selection is nevertheless imperfect . using the @xcite selection line , @xmath401 drops from @xmath424% completeness at @xmath425 to @xmath426% for @xmath356 ; by the same token , @xmath406 is @xmath427% for all masses .",
    "( these numbers are entirely consistent with the caveats given by * ? ? ?",
    "this again serves to unambiguously demonstrate the difficultly of using a hard cut in an optical colour  magnitude or colour  mass diagram to meaningfully select red / blue galaxy samples .",
    "finally , let us turn our attention to the comparison between our results and those of @xcite .",
    "this comparison is particularly interesting and important , given the elegant ` semi - empirical ' model for the quenching of star formation within galaxies that these authors have advanced based on their results .",
    "the @xcite model predicts a single schechter function for star - forming galaxies , and a two - component schechter function for quenched / passive galaxies .",
    "the model also makes the specific prediction that the secondary component of the mf for quenched galaxies should have the same shape as , but a lower normalisation than , the mf for star - forming galaxies .",
    "they show that their observed blue / red mfs , based on data from sdss and zcosmos , and selected using the cut in the @xmath178-@xmath428 colour - magnitude diagram , can be understood in this way .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : punchline ] , it is clear that the @xcite cut is rather bluer than others , such that their blue sample is only @xmath424% complete for b - type galaxies , even at the lowest masses .",
    "in other words , fully @xmath429% of what we classify as ` b - type ' galaxies would be counted by @xcite as ` red ' . by the same token ,",
    "their red sample is heavily contaminated : more than half of those galaxies selected as red / quenched by @xcite are classified by us as being b - type .",
    "this is absolutely crucial in the context of the @xcite model , which makes the specific prediction that the secondary component of the mf for quenched galaxies should have the same shape as , but a lower normalisation than , the mf for star - forming galaxies .",
    "it should now be clear how exactly this kind of behaviour can be produced by using too - blue a cut : once the red - selected sample becomes highly contaminated , it becomes simply a shadow of the blue mf .",
    "this effect does not rely on , but will be amplified by , the effects of photometric scatter discussed in .",
    "we thus highlight the possibility that the low mass upturn in the red mf seen by @xcite and others simply reflects a high degree of ` contamination ' of the ` red ' sample by members of the ` blue ' population .",
    "this happens where the relative numbers of red galaxies is low , and the hard red / blue selection limit enters the red wings of the blue distribution .",
    "this interpretation also explains why the red upturn has a similar shape to the blue mf : because the galaxies responsible for this upturn _ are _ actually members of the blue population .    taken at face value , our results would therefore appear to be in conflict with the quenching model advanced by @xcite .",
    "however , this statement is only true to the extent that our r - type galaxies can be interpreted , in astrophysical terms , as being genuinely ` quenched ' .",
    "but still , looking at fig .  [ fig : punchline ] and back to fig .",
    "[ fig : stardist ] , the same criticism could be levelled at @xcite .    in light of the above ,",
    "the strongest point that we are prepared to advocate at this stage is only that the relative shapes and absolute values of the b and r ( or blue and red ) mfs depends very sensitively on how the different populations are defined / selected / classified ( see also , _",
    "e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .",
    "further , we stress the dangers of over - interpretting the physical significance of any hard red / blue selection , given the basic fact of overlap between the two r and b populations .",
    "this is precisely why we have set out to derive objective and phenomenological b / r classifications , which are empirically derived from our statistical description of the observed data .",
    "the basic problem that we have sought to overcome in our analysis is that the _ optical _ colour distributions of the b and r populations overlap . we are certainly not the first to apprehend the difficulties in using optical colours to distinguish ` developed ' from ` developing ' galaxies .",
    "our solution to this problem has been to devise a mixture modelling approach to account for this fact .",
    "most authors , however , have sought to circumvent these problems , rather than attempt to confront them head on .",
    "many others have argued that an optical  nir colour  colour diagram ( see _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be used to isolate ` quiescent ' galaxies .",
    "the idea is that the dust and age / metallicity vectors are no longer parallel in a such a diagram , and so ` red and dead ' galaxies and ` dusty star - formers ' are more easily separated .",
    "this kind of colour selection thus acts as a very simple ( two - colour ) sed - based classification .",
    "taking this idea to its logical conclusion , other authors have explicitly used sps modelling of seds to develop a young / old classification scheme . for example , @xcite have selected ` passive ' galaxies based on the best - fit sps template .",
    "after the fact , they then show that these ` passive ' galaxies are indeed concentrated in the expected region of the nuv@xmath19@xmath38 colour  colour diagram .    by considering the intrinsic stellar @xmath44 color ,",
    "we have used the information encoded in the multicolour seds to , insofar as is possible , break the degeneracy between dust and age / metallicity . in this way , we are using @xmath44 as a continuous and quantitative diagnostic of a galaxy s stellar population .",
    "then , we have used a phenomenological , descriptive model of the bivariate @xmath50@xmath44 distribution to derive a quantitative , probabilistic classification scheme .",
    "next , similar to @xcite , we can elucidate the nature of  and validate our interpretation of ",
    "these classifications by showing how our classifications map onto other common diagnostic plots .",
    "we explicitly show how our b / r - classification scheme maps onto the _ uvj _ diagram in * fig .",
    "[ fig : nircols ] * , which shows the galaxies in our sample , separated into broad mass bins , and colour - coded according to their objective b / r - type classification , @xmath359 .",
    "these plots can be compared to the restframe _ uvj _ colour  colour diagram used by , for example , @xcite to and isolate the ` dead sequence ' of truly passive galaxies at high redshifts .    for this figure ,",
    "the restframe _ uvj _ photometry have been derived using a heavily refactored version of the interrest algorithm for interpolating restframe photometry @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that the derivation of these restframe colours is completely independent from the sed fits used to derive the values of @xmath50 , @xmath41 , @xmath44 , etc .",
    "it can be seen that , in broad terms , our @xmath44-based separation between b- and r - type galaxies behaves as expected in the _ uvj _ colour  colour diagram : the r - type galaxies are tightly clustered , and in a location that is above and/or to the left of the ` blue sequence ' .",
    "this demonstrates that our optical sed fits can distinguish between the seds of ` red and dead ' galaxies and ` dusty star formers ' , and thus that our values of @xmath44 do provide a meaningful characterisation of galaxies stellar populations .",
    "the different panels fig .",
    "[ fig : nircols ] show how our b / r - type classifications is projected onto the _ uvj _ diagram at different mass ranges .",
    "looking at the classifications , the point of transition from mostly b - type ( blue points ) to mostly r - type ( red points ) can be seen to correspond qualitative changes in the 2d data density that , in simple terms , look like different populations .        it can be seen in this figure that there is some mass - dependent ` creep ' to how our b / r classification maps onto the _ uvj _ diagram . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", however , the argument could be made that this is desirable .",
    "certainly , it is clear that the locus of ` red ' galaxies , however defined , shifts to redder colours at higher masses .",
    "this is just the colour  mass relation in another guise .",
    "indeed , in the lower mass bins our b / r - type classifications might provide a better characterisation of the two - population nature of the data than the standard hard selection box shown .",
    "it is worth explicitly noting that the _ uvj _ selection box shown would capture predominately b - type galaxies at the lowest masses : the ` reliability ' of a _ uvj _ selected sample of r - type galaxies would be only @xmath430 % . in comparison to our determination of the r mf , such a _ uvj_-selected ` red ' mf would be inflated .",
    "moreover , this would act in such a way that the inferred ` red ' mf would have approximately the same low mass slope as the ` blue ' one .",
    "this is highly significant in the context of the results of @xcite .      *",
    "[ fig : hdd4 ] * shows a similar but different test , this time using the @xmath431 and h@xmath432 spectral diagnostics .",
    "these measurements have been made using the available gama or literature spectra for each galaxy in our sample .",
    "for the purposes of this plot , we have imposed a signal - to - noise cut across the relevant wavelength range to ensure reasonable data quality .",
    "this effectively introduces a bias against the reddest galaxies , particularly at low masses .",
    "representative error bars for each bin are shown .    in this diagram ,",
    "stars with ages @xmath433 gyr will have both @xmath434 and h@xmath435 ( see , _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) . because these measurements are made over a narrow wavelength range , they are very weakly sensitive to dust .",
    "this diagnostic diagram shows that the optical spectra of r type galaxies are completely dominated by old stars , with little to no contribution from stars less than @xmath436 gyr old . in other words , and modulo the caveat in the previous paragraph , these results suggest that those galaxies that we have classified as r - type have seen no significant star formation activity in the past 1 gyr or more .",
    "the results presented in this section are intended to demonstrate two important facts .",
    "first , the results shown in each of these two figures illustrate that  and how  our b - r classifications faithfully and meaningfully encapsulate differences in galaxies sed shapes , and hence stellar populations . in particular , these figures show how , particularly for @xmath132 , the r - type population is analogous to commonly used ` red and dead ' , ` passive ' , or ` quenched ' selection criteria .",
    "second , and more perhaps more importantly , we have presented these diagnostic diagrams as a means to evaluate the meaning of our _ phenomenological and empirically derived _",
    "b / r classification scheme . earlier , in",
    ", we have said that our results can be used to gain insight into the process of quenching , but only to the extent that our operational definitions of ` red ' or ` r'-ness can be taken to mean ` quenched ' . in this regard , we can now offer a more astrophysical characterisation of what distinguishes r- and b - type galaxies : namely , that the light from r - type galaxies is completely dominated by stars with ages @xmath433 gyr .      in this work ,",
    "we have used the intrinsic , dust - corrected @xmath44 colour as a diagnostic parameter for a galaxy s stellar population . as mentioned in ,",
    "this quantity is a very good proxy for luminosity - weighted mean stellar age .",
    "we have then used our parametric , descriptive mixture - modelling of the @xmath44 cmd to construct an objective b / r - type classification scheme , and so derive operational definitions for these designations . in this section ,",
    "we have used complementary diagnostics to show that the stellar populations of b- and r - type galaxies do indeed differ , and in particular that r - type galaxies really do host older stars .",
    "this demonstrates that the @xmath44 parameter is indeed a useful diagnostic for distinguishing galaxies based on their stellar populations .    the line of argument that we have now developed is similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have now explicitly demonstrated , in a mass dependent way , that galaxies classified as r - type or b - type have different spectral and sed shapes , and thus that the two populations have qualitatively different stellar populations .",
    "( we also show how the kind of _ uvj _ cuts commonly used can give very misleading results at low masses . )",
    "the crucial point of difference between our analysis and those mentioned above is this : we have not explicitly set out to distinguish ` young ' and ` old ' ( or ` star forming ' and ` quenched ' ) stellar populations .",
    "instead , we have started from a phenomenological description of the optical colour  mass diagram , and used this to disentangle the two apparently distinct populations . identifying the distinguishing features of galaxies in these two populations is thus , for us , a secondary problem . in this sense , the _ implication _ from fig .  [ fig : nircols ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : hdd4 ] is that massive r - type galaxies have relatively old stellar populations , and little to no dust .",
    "this point is non - trivial , even if it may seem so at first blush .        in",
    ", we have described the various tests that we have done in an attempt to devise the best and simplest description of the data possible .",
    "this is not to say , however , that our parameterisation is right . instead , our claim is only that we do provide a good description of the data , inasmuch as our model encapsulates all the qualitative features of the bivariate colour  mass distributions , as illustrated in fig.s [ fig : rfdist][fig : starmf ] .",
    "there are some indications that some parameters could be eliminated from the model without significantly degrading the statistical quality of the fit : most notably , the data do not clearly demand a two - schechter description of the r mf . while there is some ambiguity in",
    "whether or not certain parameters ought be excluded or included , we can say with confidence that we are not grossly overfitting the data .",
    "there are some parameters for which the inferred values are consistent with zero ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mcmc ] ) . to the extent",
    "that the model does not make use of the additional freedoms that these parameters allow , they would appear unnecessary for the best , simplest possible description of the data . at the same time , and for the same reason , excluding these parameters would make no difference to the fits , or to our results . to the extent that the decision as to whether or not to include these parameters is arbitrary , it is also unimportant .",
    "as discussed in , this same criticism could be levelled at any model or modeller .",
    "the decision as to how to model one s results is an inescapable part of any modelling .",
    "furthermore , in the specific context of modelling the bimodality in the cmd , this concern is misplaced . as discussed in and , the use of a hard cut to select ` red sequence ' and",
    "` blue cloud ' galaxies directly determines the inferred shapes of the mass functions . and",
    "as discussed in , in the absence of some solid theoretical justification for the specific cuts used , these cuts must be viewed as being to some extent arbitrary .",
    "this criticism is thus much more pertinent for the vast majority of existing bimodality studies ( the notable exception being * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , as laid out in , the motivation for our analysis is precisely to address this concern , insofar as is possible .",
    "our primary motivation for our mixture model of the bivariate colour - mass distributions is to develop an objective classification scheme , which can be used to disentangle the apparently distinct populations .",
    "but this is not to deny the truth that the form of the model influences the outcome . indeed , as discussed in , this idea leads to an important caveat on our mf determinations for @xmath345 , where the application of our model to the observed colour distributions becomes problematic ( see fig .

    "further , as discussed in , we are not specifically interested in the actual values of most of the parameters that define the model .",

    "second , we are assuming that there is some scatter around these relations , to the point where the two populations are observed to overlap .",
    "taken together , these two assumptions lead to the situation where , in principle and in practice , the bluest r - type galaxies may have bluer stellar colours than the reddest b - type galaxies .",
    "this is precisely the reason why we choose to refer to the populations using the more neutral designations ` b ' and ` r ' : to try to avoid some of the confusion that comes from the strong connotations that have come to be associated with these words .",
    "some care is therefore required in interpreting our results in astrophysical terms ( see the caveats given in ) .",
    "furthermore , we stress that previous results that have used a hard cut overlook the empirical fact of scatter in the colour distributions for the ` blue ' and ` red ' populations .",
    "some care is also required in interpreting the results of past bimodality studies in astrophysical terms .",
    "we would therefore invert this criticism to argue that past studies have selected the red tail of the b population  galaxies that have young , blue stellar populations  and called these galaxies ` quenched ' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : punchline ] and in particular fig .",

    "again , we make no pretence that our particular parameterisation is in any way physically meaningful ; only that it yields a good description of the phenomenology of the cmd .",
    "our results thus offer one potential means of understanding the data , which is the most that any modeller can do . included within this",
    "is a phenomenological description of how the general population can be decomposed into two distinct but overlapping populations .",
    "our hope here is that our empirical results can be used to guide and inform the future development of genuine semi - analytical and sph models of galaxy formation in a cosmological context .",
    "what we have done in this work is to develop a means for objectively and quantitatively classifying galaxies according to their stellar populations . in the broader context of this series of papers ,",
    "our ultimate goal is to use these classifications to identify the physical differences between b- and r - type galaxies , with a view to deriving empirical constraints on the physical processes that act to determine whether any particular galaxy is b- or r - type .",
    "we therefore defer more astrophysically - minded observational studies of the galaxy bimodality ( or bimodalities ? ) to future works .      in the first instance , our goal has been to separate the general galaxy population into two subpopulations , on the basis of their constituent stellar populations , and in a mass dependent way . for our analysis of the effective @xmath41 cmd ,",
    "dust is a confounding factor .",
    "for this reason , we have repeated our analysis looking at intrinsic , dust corrected @xmath44 colours .",
    "it is true that degeneracies between dust , metallicity , and sfh in such fits mean that the uncertainties in the values of @xmath441 , @xmath37 , or @xmath442 can be large , but we maintain that these data are sufficient to make the qualitative distinction between dusty and old sed shapes . in support of this claim ,",
    "we have shown in that those galaxies that we classify as being either b- or r - type occupy different regions of the h@xmath432-d@xmath443 spectral line diagnostic diagram ( fig .  [",
    "fig : hdd4 ] ) , as well as the restframe _ uvj _ colour - colour diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nircols ] ) .",
    "in other words , the b-/r - type classifications really do encapsulate meaningful information about galaxies stellar populations .",
    "further , these classifications closely correspond to the two - population distributions seen in both diagnostic plots .",
    "conversely , we have also argued the kinds of ` red ' selections that are commonly used are a poor proxy for ` quenched ' .",
    "we have thus accomplished our primary goal of disentangling and characterising the two apparently distinct populations seen in the cmd . _",
    "some _ of our r - type galaxies conform to the usual picture of ` red and dead ' galaxies , but we have shown that these galaxies are just the high mass tip of a more continuous r population .    with our primary goal accomplished , our phenomenological characterisations of these two populations can then shed light on their astrophysical nature .",
    "this includes the mf for each population , which now represents a target for cosmological simulations to aim at .",
    "this also includes our characterisations of the @xmath44 and @xmath41 cmrs for each population , which provide qualitative constraints on the processes of star formation and of star formation quenching within galaxies .",
    "the process of galaxy formation is complicated , and there are myriad well - known and studied galaxy types and classes that we have not considered in our analysis : _ e.g. _ , radio loud agn , starbursts , e+a or post - starburst galaxies , satellites / centrals , interacting and merging galaxies , etc . some or all of these processes may play an important role in determining whether a particular galaxy is r - type or b - type , or conversely , some of these processes may act exclusively on or within r- or b - type galaxies . in this way , these processes are presumably also responsible for producing the observed intrinsic scatter around each of the two cmrs .    by the same token , galaxies are in general multi - component systems . as a simple example , most massive galaxies have both a disk and a bulge component , with separate stellar populations and formation mechanisms .",
    "for example , @xcite have argued that galaxies _ global _ colours are driven by the mixture of ( blue ) disk stars and ( red ) bulge stars , and that the colour bimodality is thus best understood in terms of the ( bimodal ) distribution of bulge - to - disk mass ratios .",
    "we have deliberately avoided these kinds of questions in this work ; our intention is only to derive an empirical , phenomenological description of the apparent dichotomy in the stellar populations of field galaxies  that is , the nature of the r- and b galaxy populations . in doing so",
    ", we have derived an objective , operational definition for these designations .",
    "this is a necessary prerequisite for future studies of the different astrophysical natures of these two galaxy populations , which we will pursue in future papers .    in light of the above ,",
    "it is remarkable that this game can be played at all . here",
    "again , we stress there are no clear signs of an intermediate or transition ` green ' population .",
    "that the bivariate colour  mass distribution for the field galaxy population is extremely well described by a simple two - population model implies that our phenomenological distinction between b- and r - type galaxies does indeed encapsulate some important astrophysical differences in the formation histories or evolutionary states of these two populations  even if we can not yet articulate what these differences are , or what the driver for these differences may be .",
    "our particular interest lies in characterising the mass functions ( mfs ) and colour - mass relations ( cmrs ) for the apparently distinct populations seen in the optical colour - mass diagram ( cmd ) , where the two populations are distinguished on the basis of galaxies stellar populations .",
    "our analysis is based on a sample of @xmath1 and @xmath0 field galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey .",
    "this sample is properly mass - complete ( volume limited ) for @xmath132 ; for lower masses , we have used the standard @xmath102 formalism to account for incompleteness ( see ) .",
    "note that none of our results or conclusions change if we limit our analysis to @xmath173 , or to @xmath116 .    the immediate motivation for reconsidering this well - studied problem is that , as discussed in , there are quantitative and qualitative disagreements between the mf determinations that exist in the literature .",
    "first , we have shown that if we analyse our gama - sample in the same way as each of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we are able to reproduce each of these authors sdss - based results",
    ". then , we argue that the discrepancies between the results and conclusions of these studies are due entirely to the different ( and most often arbitrary ) ways that the ` blue ' and ` red ' galaxy samples have been selected / defined .",
    "our first and most important conclusion is therefore a qualitative one : that the largest uncertainty in previous characterisations of the mass functions for ` red ' and ` blue ' galaxies is tied to how these terms are defined .",
    "put bluntly , the main reason why , say , @xcite see an upturn at the low end of the ` red ' mf where , say , @xcite do not is simply because the @xcite definition of ` red ' is considerably bluer than the @xcite one . as a direct consequence , a significant fraction of the @xcite ` red ' sample",
    "are star forming galaxies with young stellar populations ( see fig.s [ fig : otherdust ] , [ fig : punchline ] , and [ fig : nircols ] ) .",
    "the direct implication is that the power of these results to provide useful constraints on the process of galaxy evolution is directly limited by the extent to which the specific ` red ' and ` blue ' selections used can be shown to be astrophysically meaningful . in the absence of convincing arguments in favour of any one of these selections over the others , important questions like the mass range over which the galaxy population transitions from mostly blue to mostly red , or the low mass slopes of the blue and red mass functions , are left largely unconstrained . in order to address these questions ,",
    "what is needed is a well - motivated operational definition for the technical terms ` red ' and ` blue ' .    to redress this ,",
    "we have developed a descriptive model for the distribution of galaxies in cmd , with the specific goal of distinguishing between ` developed ' and ` developing ' galaxies on the basis of their stellar populations . in our modelling , we treat the observed data distribution as being the sum of two distinct but overlapping populations .",
    "the model also includes a ` bad ' component to allow for outliers , catastrophic errors , or otherwise un- or under - modelled aspects of the observed distributions ( see and ) .",
    "the formalism for our modelling , which is developed pedagogically in appendix [ app : themodel ] , is based on the method of ( gaussian ) mixture modelling ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "as outlined in , in its most general form , our descriptive model is fully defined by 40 parameters . as discussed in ,",
    "not all of these parameters are strictly necessary for a ` good ' description of the data .",
    "in particular , it is not clear that the data strictly demand a second schechter component to well describe the mf for the r population . as discussed in , however , where there is ambiguity about whether or not a parameter is necessary , it will have little to no impact on the final results . beyond that , the most that we can say is that we have made every attempt to ensure that we are not grossly overfitting our data .    in effect",
    ", there are two assumptions that underpin our approach .",
    "first , we are assuming that some physical process(es ) or hidden parameter(s ) act to determine whether a given galaxy is a member of one or the other population ; that is , _ we assume that there are two populations , which follow distinct cmrs_. then , some secondary process(es ) or parameter(s ) determines where that galaxy falls with respect to the main cmr for that population ; that is , _ we assume that there is some ( gaussian ) scatter around each of the two cmrs _ , to the point that the two populations are observed to overlap in an optical cmd ( or , indeed , in a _ uvj _",
    "colour  colour diagram ) .",
    "neither of these assumptions ought to be controversial .    allowing that , at fixed mass",
    ", there is some overlap between the ` blue ' and ` red ' colour distributions inescapably implies that some ` red ' galaxies will have bluer colours than some ` blue ' galaxies . in acknowledgement of this semantic trap , and to avoid some of the confusing connotations associated with the terms ` blue ' and ` red ' , we have adopted the more generic designations of ` b ' and ` r ' to describe the two populations seen in the cmd ( see and ) .",
    "that is , rather than considering blue and red _ galaxies _ , we focus on two galaxy _ populations _ , which we dub b and r. it is not necessarily true that a particular b- galaxy will be bluer than some other r - galaxy .",
    "it is also not necessarily true that an r - type galaxy can be thought of as being ` red and dead ' , ` early type ' , ` quiescent ' , etc .",
    "it nevertheless remains true that the distribution of stellar population properties are different for galaxies in each of the two populations  in particular , at fixed mass , and on average , galaxies in the b - population have bluer ( and so younger ) stellar populations than those in the r - population .",
    "in other words , we are assuming that the phenomenological separation of the general galaxy population into b- and r - type subpopulations somehow reflects a qualitative binarity in the formation histories or evolutionary states of galaxies  but it remains to describe and explain precisely how and why this is the case . by modelling these populations",
    ", we can actually _ derive from the data _ phenomenological working definitions for the terms ` b- ' and ` r - type ' ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : rffrac ] , and fig .",
    "[ fig : starfrac ] ) .",
    "what is more , the classifications are _ objective _ , insofar as objectivity is possible ( see ) .",
    "bearing in mind the caveats given above , we go on to describe the basic characteristics of the b- and r - population in terms of both the effective @xmath41 cmd ( fig .  [ fig : rfcmr ] ) , as well as the intrinsic , dust - corrected colour , @xmath44 cmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : starcmr ] ) . that the members of these two populations comprise",
    "genuinely different stellar populations has been demonstrated in , where we show that r- and b - type galaxies occupy distinct regions of the _ uvj _ and @xmath431h@xmath432 diagnostic diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nircols ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : hdd4 ] ) .",
    "we find that the intrinsic @xmath44 cmr for the b population is both considerably tighter and more linear than the effective @xmath41 cmr .",
    "this implies that the both the upturn in the @xmath41 cmr at @xmath361 and the relatively large scatter around the @xmath41 cmr at all masses is driven by the distribution of dust properties , rather than differences in the stellar populations of these galaxies . at least for @xmath444 ,",
    "the relative flatness of the @xmath44 cmr for b - type galaxies also implies that , in terms of stellar colours , the b population is relatively homogenous",
    ".    this behaviour changes , however , for @xmath356 . at this mass range , the b population appears to converge with the red sequence in the @xmath41 cmd .",
    "this is also where the mf for b galaxies drops off very rapidly . in other words , there are few if any galaxies with @xmath356 with young ( b - type ) stellar populations ; this represents the top end of the blue sequence .    for the r population ,",
    "if nothing else , we can say with confidence that there are essentially no @xmath128 field galaxies with stellar populations that are the same as or similar to those of the genuinely ` red and dead ' galaxies seen at the highest masses . instead , at least for @xmath445 , we see a gradual trend whereby less massive galaxies have progressively bluer stellar colours ( _ i.e. _ , younger luminosity - weighted mean stellar ages and/or lower mean stellar metallicities ) than their more massive cousins .",
    "the relatively small dispersion in @xmath44 cmr for the r - population suggests that , at fixed mass , r - type galaxies have rather similar stellar populations , and hence similar star formation / stellar assembly histories . at the same time",
    ", the slope of the @xmath44 cmr for r - type galaxies shows that there are differences in the evolutionary histories of different members of the r populations with different present day masses .",
    "said another way , the evolution of individual r - type galaxies in the field proceeds in such a way as to create or preserve the correlation between the stellar mass on the one hand , and stellar population on the other .",
    "these observations  the relative homogeneity of the stellar colours of b - type galaxies , and the correlation between stellar mass and stellar population for r - type galaxies  run counter to prevalent notions of the ` red sequence ' and the ` blue cloud ' .",
    "they also provide meaningful targets for theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution to aim for .    for @xmath121 ,",
    "it becomes increasingly difficult to meaningfully and robustly distinguish two separate b and r populations from the joint @xmath41 and @xmath44 colour - mass distributions .",
    "indeed , looking _ only _ at the observed colour distributions in bins of mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rfdist ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : stardist ] ) , there is little to no clear evidence for a distinct r population at @xmath128 .",
    "our claim is therefore that , below @xmath446 , we are no longer able to unambiguously identify a distinct r - component to the general field population : at least for field galaxies , below @xmath3 , the r population dissolves into obscurity . at these low masses ,",
    "our characterisation of the r population may be better interpreted as describing the degree of asymmetry in the observed colour distributions , and our mf for the r population may be taken as an _ upper limit _ on the number of galaxies that lie outside the main colour distribution for ` normal ' b - type galaxies ( see ) .",
    "we note in passing that the data do not clearly demand an intermediate ` green ' population : the data are very well described by a two - population model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rfdist ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : stardist ] ) . taking this remarkable observation at face value",
    ", this might imply that movement between populations is quick ( see , _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , it could imply that movement _ within _ a population ( for example , by satellite accretion / minor mergers ) is much faster than movement _ between _ populations : a galaxy may be ` passed ' from one population to the other , and then have its colour rapidly re - randomised according to the ` normal ' colour distribution for its new population .",
    "we also note that optically - identified agn reside exclusively within the blue sequence defined by the b population ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colours ] ) .",
    "that is , in terms of their stellar populations , agn hosts do not clearly differ from ` ordinary ' star forming galaxies .",
    "certainly they do not represent a transition population that is intermediate between the b and r populations .",
    "the mfs that we derive for the r and b populations are rather different to those for ` red ' and ` blue ' galaxies presented by other authors ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : punchline ] ) .",
    "the reasons for these differences are discussed first in , and then again in close detail in .",
    "in particular , we find considerably more ` b ' galaxies with @xmath141 , and a much more abrupt drop - off in the b mf at @xmath356 . whereas others put the crossover mass , where the two mfs intersect , at @xmath44710.3 , we find it to be closer to 10.5 .",
    "further , our mf for r - type galaxies is also considerably lower at low masses than those for ` red ' galaxies from the literature . _",
    "if _ these red or r - type mfs can be used to probe the process of quenching , our results would imply that quenching is less prevalent  or equivalently , that massive galaxies continue forming new stars for longer  than has been previously thought .",
    "but this leads to the final and most important caveat : as discussed at length in and , there is real danger in inappropriately reifying the terms ` b- ' and ` r - type'or , equally , the terms ` blue ' or ` red ' .",
    "these terms must be understood as qualitative , phenomenological designations for galaxy _ populations_. in particular , one should not conflate the terms ` r ' or ` red ' with the term ` quenched ' .",
    "this is especially true at low masses , where the stellar populations of ` red ' or r - type galaxies are rather different to those found at higher masses .    as discussed throughout this paper , it is necessarily and inescapably true that our results depend on the choices made in the construction of our model  we can only answer the question that we have asked . in particular , the decision to use gaussians to describe the colour distributions at fixed mass is primarily one of convenience .",
    "our justification for these decisions is ultimately empirical ",
    "the proof is in the pudding .",
    "we have thus shown that our descriptive modelling provides one potential way of understanding the data .",
    "the fact nevertheless remains that using a different operational definition for the terms ` red ' and ` blue ' will lead to quantitatively and perhaps qualitatively different results .",
    "we do not pretend to be immune to these difficulties . instead , our goal is to highlight the importance of these issues , and to make it clear that the same criticisms can and should be levelled at any study of the ` red ' and ` blue ' galaxy populations .",
    "but then again , we have also validated our results by showing how the phenomenological b / r classifications that come from our model do indeed select galaxies with qualitatively different stellar populations .",
    "this point is particularly significant in connection with the elegant semi - empirical model for quenching presented by @xcite , which hinges on the presence or absence of an upturn to the mf for quenched galaxies at @xmath121 .",
    "looking at the distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rfdist ] or fig .",
    "[ fig : stardist ] , ( or even the _ uvj _ diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : nircols ] ) it should be immediately obvious how problematic it is to meaningfully distinguish a separate ` red ' or ` quenched ' or even ` r'-type population at these low masses ( see ) .",
    "further , it must be recognised how a sample of ` old ' or ` quenched ' galaxies selected using a hard cut in any of these diagrams  including the _ uvj _ diagram  will be dominated at low masses by spillover from the red tail of the distribution of otherwise normal , young , star - forming , b - type galaxies .",
    "the critical issue is therefore whether or in what sense these galaxies can be thought of as a distinct , coherent population of quenched galaxies .",
    "this paper is the first in a series in which we explore the different aspects or manifestations of the bimodality ( or bimodalities ) in galaxy properties . in papers",
    "ii and iii , we will perform a similar analysis to explore bimodalities in terms of line emission properties , and in terms of srsic - fit structural parameters .",
    "taken together , these three papers will provide a basis for robustly and objectively classifying galaxies according to the stellar populations , present day star formation and/or agn activity , and structure . in future works",

    "further , the measurement errors in @xmath12 and @xmath64 are , in general , correlated , in the sense that if a galaxy s colour is overestimated , then so too will its mass - to - light ratio , and thus its total stellar mass . in this case , and sticking with the assumption of gaussian errors , what we have generically referred to as @xmath451 is most simply represented by a covariance matrix , @xmath77 , as defined in .    consider observing an instance drawn from our generative model that ` really ' lies at the position @xmath486 , which lies somewhere along the line @xmath487 .",
    "so long as the measurement errors can be treated as being gaussian , then the probability of observing this point at the position @xmath363 is given by : @xmath488 ~ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have now also introduced @xmath489 as a shorthand for the ( normalised ) 2d gaussian centred on the point @xmath490 , and with covariance given by the matrix @xmath491 .",
    "this expression can thus be understood as describing the contribution to the expected , observed data density at the location @xmath363 in the observed cmd , owing to the ` true ' , underlying distribution at the location @xmath209 , when observed with measurement errors described by @xmath77 .    in order to derive an expectation for the net observed data density at the location @xmath363or , in other words , the overall likelihood of observing the datapoint @xmath363it is therefore necessary to integrate over all possible values of @xmath209 .",
    "if the underlying distribution is truly a perfect , uniformly populated and infinitely thin line , then this line integral takes the following form : @xmath492 ~              { \\mathcal{g}}_2({\\underline{x } } { { } _ i } - { \\underline{x } } ' , { \\underline{\\underline{\\mathrm{s } } } } { { } _ i } ) ~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the second line , we have re - written the original line integral to highlight the fact that it can alternatively be understood as a convolution between the underlying data distribution and the measurement error ellipse ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath493 \\otimes { \\mathcal{g}}_2 ( { \\underline{x } } { { } _ i } , { \\underline{\\underline{\\mathrm{s } } } } { { } _ i } ) $ ] .",
    "here , we have used the kronecker delta function , @xmath494 $ ] , to enforce the condition that @xmath487 for points on the line ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath495 $ ] is taken to represent the intrinsic distribution in @xmath496 space .",
    "we have also used to re - express @xmath497 as @xmath498 . and @xmath499 .",
    "the difference between these two quantities boils down to the distinction between _ error _ and _ uncertainty_. when a measurement is made , there is ( almost ) always some _ error _ ; that is , a difference between the true and measured values .",
    "this quantity is , by definition , unknowable .",
    "at the same time , whenever a measurement is made , it will ( or should ) always come with an associated _ uncertainty _ , which reflects the allowed range of ` true ' values that are consistent with the measured values .",
    "this is something that can ( and should ) be estimated . in this sense , the uncertainties represent our priors on the error distribution , to be marginalised over .",
    "the assumption underpinning the sleight of hand by which we have made @xmath500 is therefore that the probability distribution for the measurement _ errors _ is faithfully described by our formal measurement _ uncertainties_. in particular , the assumption is that the errors are random , not systematic , and that the error distribution function is gaussian in form . ]    sticking with the assumption that the underlying distribution is a perfect line , this line or convolution integral can be done analytically .",
    "the result is simply a 1d gaussian : @xmath501 here , @xmath502 and @xmath503 are the ( scalar ) projections of the vector @xmath363 and the error ellipse described by @xmath77 , respectively , onto the normal vector for the line , @xmath504 . in other words , if the slope of the line is @xmath479 , then @xmath504 is a unit vector in the direction @xmath505 , and @xmath506 and @xmath507 are defined as @xmath508 and ( @xmath509 ) , respectively . can just as easily be thought of in terms of the angle of the line @xmath510 , in which case @xmath504 becomes @xmath511 . ]",
    "while this result may at first appear to be surprisingly simple , with a moment s reflection it becomes immediately intuitive . by a symmetry argument",
    ", the probability density around the line _ must _ depend only on the perpendicular distance from it .",
    "( think of the electrical field above a charged wire or plate . ) in the simple case of a distribution with @xmath512 , the scatter in the @xmath12 direction is immaterial  for each point from the ",
    "true distribution that is scattered to the right , another will be scattered from the left to take its place .",
    "any covariance between @xmath513 and @xmath66 , which just represents a shearing of @xmath65 along the @xmath64 axis , is similarly immaterial .",
    "at least in the case that the errors in @xmath12 and @xmath64 are uncorrelated , the solution of @xmath514 is still analytic .",
    "( this is sometimes referred to as deming regression , particularly among chemists and in the medical sciences . )",
    "it is also possible to derive an analytic solution in the more general case of correlated errors .",
    "however , we would argue that , in this day and age , it is just as easy to solve the problem numerically , which can be almost trivially done using any number of established optimisation algorithms .",
    "this is doubly true if one wants to quantify the uncertainties in the fit parameters ( as one should ) .",
    "furthermore , once one adopts a bayesian perspective ( as we strongly advocate ) , the ` maximum likelihood ' solution becomes all but meaningless .",
    "instead , the bayesian strives to constrain the values of the model parameters _ given the observed data _ ; that is , to derive the posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the full range of allowed parameter values .",
    "if the above discussion has been somewhat long and laboured , it is to make the following point very clear : even within the framework of traditional maximum likelihood or @xmath6 minimisation fitting , _ it is very easy to account for completely general gaussian uncertainties . _",
    "the only change to the formalism that is required is to shift from the offset and scatter in the @xmath64 direction to those perpendicular to the linear relation ; that is , to use the definition of @xmath201 given in in place of that in . almost without exception ,",
    "if a more general description of the observational errors or uncertainties is available or can be assumed , there is no good reason not to use this information .",
    "the next assumption we intend to relax is that the underlying data distribution comes from an infinitely thin line .",
    "instead , we will allow that there is some intrinsic , astrophysical scatter around the blue and red cmrs , which we intend to fit for . in the absence of any other better motivated alternatives",
    ", we will make the simplest and most convenient assumption that this intrinsic scatter can be treated as being gaussian .",
    "this requires the introduction of a new parameter into the set @xmath191 , which we will denote as @xmath515 , and which should be understood as being the intrinsic variance around the ` true ' cmr .",
    "intrinsic scatter can be accommodated by considering it as an additional kind of ` error ' on points drawn from a perfect linear relationship .",
    "a linear relationship with gaussian scatter can be represented as the convolution of perfect line with a gaussian ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath516 \\otimes { \\mathcal{g}}_1(y { { } _ i } , \\zeta^2)$ ] . by the associativity of convolutions",
    "the procedures @xmath517 and @xmath518 are equivalent ; by the commutativity of convolutions , it does not matter which of the two gaussians in this schema is represents the intrinsic scatter , and which represents the measurement errors .",
    "then , since the convolution of two gaussians with variances @xmath515 and @xmath466 is itself a gaussian with variance @xmath519 , it is clear that we are justified in treating @xmath14 as being akin to ` just another source of error '",
    ". thus we have : @xmath520 \\otimes { \\mathcal{g}}_1 ( y { { } _ i } , \\zeta^2 ) \\otimes { \\mathcal{g}}_2 ( { \\underline{x } } { { } _ i } , { \\underline{\\underline{\\mathrm{s } } } } { { } _ i } ) ~ .\\ ] ]    there are then two options for how to include @xmath515 . if @xmath515 is taken to be the intrinsic variance _",
    "perpendicular to the relation _ , then it can be folded into by simply replacing @xmath521 with @xmath522 .",
    "the alternative is to define @xmath515 as being the variance _ in the y direction_. since this is the more physically sensible way to envisage astrophysical scatter in the cmrs , this is how we choose to treat @xmath515 ; it should thus be thought of as representing the intrinsic variance in colours at fixed mass .",
    "once we have defined @xmath14 in this way , using the arguments presented in the previous section , we can now define @xmath523 , where @xmath524 is the angle of the linear relation .",
    "then , becomes : @xmath525    again , we stress that it is not all that hard to incorporate intrinsic scatter into the traditional maximum likelihood fitting framework . at this stage , however , ( we believe that ) the maximum likelihood problem can no longer be solved analytically ; it requires the use of a computer .",
    "it is true that , in most cases , the inferred values of the linear fit parameters will not be strongly covariant with the inferred scatter .",
    "however , any ` goodness of fit ' statistic  and thus uncertainties on these parameters_will _ depend on the true , underlying variance .",
    "furthermore , in many cases  including ours  the scatter is itself a quantity of astrophysical interest , and it makes little if any sense to neglect it .",
    "as @xcite stress , traditional weighted @xmath6 minimisation fitting methods are generically sensitive to outliers , or ` bad data ' .",
    "however , these authors also outline a solution to this problem  the method of ( gaussian ) mixture modelling . the basic idea here",
    "is to add a secondary component to our generative model , so that it is able to generate both ` bad ' and ` good ' data .    constructing a generative model for such ` bad ' data obviously requires that we make some working assumptions about the ` true ' distribution of ` bad ' data in the observed @xmath257 plane .",
    "developing a full and an accurate description of such ` bad ' data is not something that is easily done ; further , it is not something that we are particularly interested in doing .",
    "that said , we echo @xcite in saying that `` the power of this [ method ] comes not from making an _ accurate _ model of the outliers , it comes simply from _ modelling _ them '' ( emphasis in the original ) . and",
    "in the end , as described in , we will marginalise over these ` nuisance parameters ' that describe the ` bad ' data distribution , leaving us only with the parameters that we genuinely care about .",
    "since we have no concrete knowledge of the ` bad ' distribution , we make the simplest possible assumption and treat this distribution as gaussian .",
    "we also consider all data points as having an equal probability of being or becoming ` bad ' ; our desire to objectively identify ` bad ' data points requires that we make no _ a priori _ assumptions as to the ` badness ' or otherwise of individual data points .",
    "we thus choose to model the ` badness ' within our data as an additional source of error in the measured values of @xmath12 and @xmath64.@xmath64 space , characterised by five parameters : the mean and variance in both @xmath12 and @xmath64 , plus an overall normalisation factor .",
    "our solution is thus less general : we have fixed the mean values of @xmath12 and @xmath64 for the ` bad ' component to be the same as for the ` good ' one . ]    in other words , the model for the bad data is constructed by convolving the ` good ' distribution with an additional ( large ) gaussian error distribution ; this error can then be treated in the same way as in the previous two sections .",
    "assuming for the moment that a given data point _ is _ bad , then its likelihood can be written : @xmath526 in writing this expression , we have defined @xmath527 , where @xmath261 would be the error matrix that describes the ` badness ' , in direct analogy to the @xmath528 introduced in .",
    "again , @xmath529 should be understood as the likelihood of finding a datapoint at the location @xmath530 given or assuming that it is ` bad ' .",
    "if some fraction @xmath259 of all datapoints are bad , then the net likelihood of observing the datapoint @xmath363 becomes : @xmath531 where @xmath532 is the likelihood for ` good ' data , defined , to now , as in .",
    "further , the ` bad ' parameter set @xmath533 should now be understood to be included as a subset of the larger parameter set @xmath191 .",
    "the above represents our first real departure from traditional frequentist statistical analysis , inasmuch as we have now introduced the nuisance parameters @xmath534 .",
    "while these parameters are certainly important in the calculation , we are not interested in their values _ per se_. it is through the bayesian process of marginalisation that we can push these parameters into the background , and thus focus on the quantities of genuine interest .",
    "the utility of these parameters is that they allow us to objectively identify and ` mask ' those datapoints that can not reasonably be considered to have been drawn from the ` true ' underlying distribution , so as to limit the influence of any and all ` bad ' points on the values of the ` good ' parameters .",
    "taking this idea just a little bit further : what we have done is created a mechanism within the fitting process that operates to accommodate outlying data within a secondary , ` bad ' component to the error / uncertainty distribution function .",
    "further , given set of trial values for the parameters in the full set @xmath191 , the ` badness ' of any individual datapoint can be evaluated be considering the relative likelihood that that point has been drawn from either the ` bad ' or the ` good ' populations .",
    "specifically , the probability that a point is ` bad ' is given by @xmath535 .",
    "this mechanism can equally well be understood in two ways .",
    "first , it can be viewed as using a two - component gaussian to describe the uncertainties on each point , with the understanding that we are now _ fitting _ for ( part of ) the error / uncertainty distribution function .",
    "alternatively , it can be viewed as modelling the observed data distribution as being the sum of two components : a ` bad ' one , and a ` good ' one .",
    "the ` bad ' one has both a larger scatter , as given by @xmath261 , and a lower normalisation , given by @xmath259 . by virtue of the fact that the values of these parameters are determined in the course of the fit , their inclusion has the effect of flexibly and objectively determining , on the basis of their ` badness ' , which points ought be downweighted when fitting for the ` good ' parameters . in this way",
    ", points are classified according to their ` badness ' in a way that is both objective , and empirical ; _ i.e. _ , based on the observed dataset , in its entirety .",
    "until now , our discussion in this section has only considered the case of fitting a single line to an observed dataset .",
    "but as we have seen , the general galaxy population can be decomposed into two distinct but overlapping populations in the cmd .",
    "our generative model therefore needs to simultaneously describe these two separate populations .",
    "the conceptual basis for how we can go about doing this has already been laid out in the previous section . in the same way as we have split the observed @xmath257 distribution into ` good ' and ` bad ' components , we now split the ` good ' distribution into distinct ` blue ' and ` red ' components .",
    "we can then consider separately the likelihoods of a particular galaxy as having been drawn from  or as being a member of  either the red or the blue subpopulation .",
    "this can be done by redefining @xmath458 as : @xmath536 here , we have defined two independent subsets of @xmath191 that comprise those parameters pertaining exclusively to each population ; _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath537 and similarly for @xmath538 .",
    "then , @xmath539 and @xmath540 are defined analogously to as the likelihood of drawing the datapoint @xmath363 from either the red or blue distributions . finally , in a similar way to @xmath259 above , the parameters @xmath541 and @xmath542 define the relative amplitudes of the blue and red probability distribution functions at the point @xmath363 in the ` true ' , astrophysical cmd .",
    "further , it should now be clear the ways in which mixture modelling and objective classification are two sides of the same coin .",
    "in contrast to @xmath259 , we have deliberately written @xmath541 and @xmath542 with a subscript @xmath196 . to understand the motivation for this decision ,",
    "consider the following two examples .",
    "if we were to somehow have perfect _ a priori _ knowledge of which galaxies were blue / red ( if such a thing is even possible ) , then we could set each individual @xmath541/@xmath542 to either 1 or 0 . this case would be equivalent to simultaneously  but still independently  fitting for the relations within the two subpopulations .",
    "the next level of complexity would be to fit for the relative fraction of red galaxies by treating @xmath541 and @xmath542 in the same way as we have @xmath259that is , to use a global parameter @xmath212 to modulate the relative amplitudes of the gaussians used to define @xmath539 and @xmath540 , so that @xmath543 and @xmath544 .",
    "of course , neither of these two simple cases are suitable for our purposes . instead , what we want to do is to account for the relative numbers of red and blue galaxies _ as a function of mass _ ; that is , we want to allow the values of @xmath541 and @xmath542 to vary explicitly with @xmath12 .",
    "our method for doing so is the subject of the next section .",
    "our next task is to find a way to incorporate a more general , non - uniform distribution in @xmath12 values_i.e .",
    "_ , the mass function  into our modelling / fitting algorithm . as the starting point for this section ,",
    "let us restate in the following form : @xmath545           \\otimes { \\mathcal{g}}_1 ( y { { } _ i } , \\zeta_\\mathrm{blue / red}^2 )          \\otimes { \\mathcal{g}}_2 ( { \\underline{x } } { { } _ i } , { \\underline{\\underline{\\mathrm{s } } } } { { } _ i } ) ~ , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where , again , @xmath546 is the defining function for a linear relation .",
    "let also restate equation as : @xmath547 now , realise that the principal advantage of assuming gaussian distribution functions to characterise all the different aspects of our generative model is that by doing so , each of these convolutions can be done analytically .",
    "this is why the method of mixture modelling is typically phrased in terms of gaussian distributions .",
    "so , how are we to proceed ?",
    "one way of allowing for @xmath541 and @xmath542 to vary with @xmath12 would be to treat the red and blue populations as 2d gaussian distributions in the cmd with finite widths along the direction of the cmr line , by replacing the @xmath548 \\otimes { \\mathcal{g}}_1 ( y { { } _ i } , \\zeta^2 ) $ ] with something like @xmath549",
    ". this would be the well established method of gaussian mixture modelling , and would have the advantage of keeping the calculation of the @xmath201s analytic .    of course , this is not what we want to do , because it is not astrophysically sensible .",
    "the @xcite function : @xmath550 has been found to provide a very good description for the mass distribution function of field galaxies  as well as that of many important subpopulations .",
    "ultimately , this is the distribution function that we want to use as the basis for our characterisation of the blue / red mass functions . for now , though , let us continue our discussion in generalised terms , taking @xmath551 as a generic , parametric , functional description of the distribution of @xmath12 values .",
    "as the first step towards folding in a more astrophysical and more general ( _ i.e. _ , non - uniform and non - gaussian ) mass distribution , let us define @xmath552 \\otimes { \\mathcal{g}}_1 ( y ' , \\zeta_\\mathrm{blue / red}^2 ) $ ] to represent the linear parts of our generative model ; _ i.e. _ , the convolution between the ( infinitely thin ) locii for the blue and red cmrs , as given by @xmath553 , and some scatter in the @xmath64 direction , described by the variance @xmath515 .",
    "the values of these @xmath554s are analytic , as are the convolutions @xmath555 , which are necessary to describe the effect of observational errors / uncertainties .",
    "now , the idea is to use the @xmath232s to modulate the relative amplitudes of these gaussians  both the relative amplitudes of the ` blue ' and ` red ' gaussians _ at fixed mass _ , and the relative amplitudes of these distributions _ as a function of mass_. in this way , the model for the data distribution in the ( @xmath556 ) plane becomes : @xmath557 it is important at this point to remember the integral normalisation condition on @xmath199 , and thus also on the two @xmath232s .",
    "as written , all of @xmath199 , @xmath558 , and @xmath559 should be understood to be integral normalised to unity over the ( @xmath560 ) domain ; in our case , this is @xmath561 .",
    "this means that we can not fit for the absolute overall normalisation of @xmath562 or @xmath563 .",
    "that said , we can fit the relative normalisations of @xmath562 and @xmath563 , using the global parameter @xmath212 , which we have now effectively defined via , and which from now on should be considered to be an element of @xmath191 .",
    "now , as per , the value of @xmath201 comes from the convolution between @xmath192 , and the ( gaussian ) measurement error ellipse : @xmath564 but this presents a problem : the convolution @xmath565 is no longer analytic . at this point",
    "we are thus forced to make our first formal approximation .",
    "our solution is to break the continuous mass function @xmath232 into the sum of many discrete @xmath432 functions : @xmath566 with the appropriate scaling to satisfy the integral constraint .",

    "alternatively , the analytic convolutions @xmath574 could be thought of as being computed first . in this way of thinking ,",

    "our last task for this section is to explicitly define the values of @xmath225 that we adopt for the fits .",
    "let us take the @xmath225s to be evenly spaced in the @xmath12 dimension , with a spacing given by @xmath576 , ranging from the lower limit for our sample up to some high value . in a sense , this can be thought of as using a histogram with bin centres @xmath577 in place of the continuous @xmath15 .",
    "however , because the mass function is not generally linear in @xmath12 , the mean value of @xmath578 for this bin will be slightly different from the geometric centre of the bin ; similarly the population of the bin will be slightly different to the value of @xmath304 .",
    "this is akin to the so - called eddington bias , and is most true in the high mass , exponential tail . to explicitly account for this ,",
    "then , we compute : @xmath579 using trapezoidal numerical integration .",

    "for this reason , we have glossed over this aspect of our calculation in , where we describe the full model _ in toto_. given that we have to perform this numerical integration anyway to enforce the normalisation condition on the @xmath15s , however , making this choice has a negligible cost in terms of computational runtime .",

    ", we have : @xmath593 that is , as previously described , the model for the true @xmath496 distribution of @xmath594 and @xmath595 galaxies comprises a discrete distribution of @xmath12 values ; at each of these discrete masses , the distribution of @xmath64 values ( _ i.e. _  colours ) is taken to be a ` bimodal ' distribution of two ( 1-d ) gaussians , the normalisations , centres , and widths of which are all allowed to vary parametrically as a function of @xmath12 ; _ i.e. _ , mass .    for completeness , then , we have the model probability density distribution for ` good ' data as given by the sum of distinct ` blue ' and ` red ' components : @xmath596 with an additional ` bad ' component , which is just a badly smeared version of the ` good ' distribution : @xmath597 the generative model for the net , observed ( @xmath556 ) distribution is a then mixture of these ` good ' and ` bad ' components : @xmath598 and the likelihood of observing any given datapoint is determined by convolving this model with the observational uncertainties / errors : @xmath599      the last remaining aspect of the observational dataset that remains to be accounted for is incompleteness arising from the fact that our sample is ultimately selected on the basis of apparent magnitudes ; specifically , @xmath19-band petro  magnitudes , as reported in the sdss dr6 catalogues .",
    "this has been accounted for using the standard technique of @xmath102 weighting as motivated , described , and validated in .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "take the specific example of a galaxy with mass and colour such that it would only satisfy the gama spectroscopic target selection criteria over , say , 1/3 of the total gama survey volume this side of our analysis redshift interval of @xmath595 . in this case",
    ", there would be ( modulo the effects of large - scale clustering ) 3 times as many galaxies in the real @xmath595 universe as are found in the gama catalogues . to account for this , we should count this single putative galaxy 3 times over .",
    "that is , each galaxy should be given a weighting @xmath600 .    in this way",
    ", we arrive at last at our final expression for the overall likelihood of observing our dataset , assuming some fiducial trial values for each and every parameter in the set @xmath191 : @xmath601 or , equivalently : @xmath602    [ [ ch : modelsumm ] ] summary : a generative model for the observed distribution of galaxies in the colour  mass plane ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we have now fully developed our model to predict or describe the observed distribution of galaxies in the cmd , accounting for distinct blue and red populations with different mass functions , and allowing both the slope of and scatter around the blue and red cmrs to vary with mass .",
    "we have also accounted for fully generalised ( if gaussian ) covariant errors in the measured values of @xmath12 and @xmath64 , as well as allowing for un - modelled or under - modelled aspects of the ( @xmath556 ) distribution as ` bad ' data .",
    "the origins of this ` bad ' data may be be astrophysical , in the sense of some additional component in the @xmath257 plane not included in the model , or observational , in the sense of catastrophic errors in the measurements .",
    "finally , we have also accounted for incompleteness arising from the magnitude - limited nature of the gama sample .    in our pedagogical development of the model ,",
    "we have attempted to make it clear that the conceptual framework that underpins our modelling is just an extension of the traditional ( frequentist ) weighted @xmath6 or ` maximum likelihood ' formalism for fitting a perfectly straight , perfectly narrow , and uniformly populated line .",
    "indeed , this simple and highly idealised situation can be seen as a special case of our ( much ) more general model . in this sense , there is only one ` trick ' that we have introduced here  the method of ( gaussian ) mixture modelling .",
    "this is what allows us to flexibly describe , and thus objectively identify and quantify , the distinct ` blue ' , ` red ' , and ` bad ' components . as stated in ,",
    "this method is intrinsically bayesian , inasmuch as the formal justification involves implicit marginalisation over all possible binomial combinations of blue-/red-/bad - ness for each individual point , with the implicit prior that all points are treated as having an equal _ a priori _ probability of being blue , or red , or ` bad ' .    with this caveat ,",
    "there is nothing preventing us from using this model to perform a frequentist ` maximum likelihood ' fit  this would simply involve identifying the set of parameter values @xmath191 that maximises the scalar likelihood function @xmath603 .",
    "however , at least with the formalism as we have laid it out , this would be dishonest . to see this , recognise that @xmath17 is only defined for a given or assumed set of values for @xmath191 .",
    "any comparison between the values of @xmath17 for different @xmath191s thus inescapably , if implicitly , assumes that the different values of @xmath191s are equally likely , or not .",
    "_ all fitting algorithms include priors _ ; the difference between bayesian and a frequentist statistics is only that these priors are made explicit in a bayesian setting .",
    "this is especially important when it comes to deriving formal uncertainties on the values of the fit parameters  by considering only @xmath603 , the frequentist does not have a good formal basis for making such a calculation , since they can not simultaneously assume two distinct sets of values for @xmath191 . in this sense , a traditional , frequentist ` maximum likelihood ' fit is just a bayesian maximum _ a posteriori _ ( map ) determination_i.e .",
    "_ , the identification of the global maximum for the posterior pdf  with ( unstated ) uniform priors .",
    "we have chosen our specific priors with this in mind . in the absence of any clearly better alternatives , we assume uniform priors for just about all of the parameters in @xmath191 .",
    "this includes uniform priors on the _ logarithm _ of the characteristic masses for the schechter functions , @xmath604 , rather than uniform priors on @xmath234 _ per se _ ) , as well as on the values of the @xmath243s ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xmath605 ) that are used in place of the @xmath606s to modulate the relative amplitudes of the different schechter function components . the only exception to this rule is for the slopes of any and all relations , which are assumed to be linear in @xmath510 , rather than linear in @xmath479 .",
    "this ensures that steeper slopes are not ` artificially ' down - weighted in preference of flatter ones . in all cases , we have checked to ensure that the allowed range for the priors is reasonable , and in particular that these ranges are broad enough to ensure that they do not ` artificially ' cut off the pdfs .",
    "the only exceptions to this rule are the sensible and obvious ones ; _",
    "e.g. _ , we require that all of the @xmath243s be in the range @xmath607 $ ] , aand that @xmath14s be positive ."
