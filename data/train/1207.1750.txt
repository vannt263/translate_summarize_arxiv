    "all - sky surveys recently carried out in hard ( @xmath1 kev ) x - rays by the _ integral _ and _ swift _ observatories have led to the discovery of hundreds new sources that enlarged the total number of hard x - ray objects known on the sky by several times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these observatories working quasi - simultaneously ( _ integral _  since the end of 2002 , _ swift _  since the end of 2004 ) are well supplementing each other : _ swift _ has more uniform coverage of the sky , but _",
    "integral _ has an advantage in observations of the most crowded fields similar to the galactic centre and galactic plane . during about @xmath2 years of operation _",
    "integral _ also deeply observed a number of selected sky fields such as the ones around 3c273 , m82 , vela and few more .",
    "the large magellanic cloud has been observed with _",
    "integral _ many times in 20032004 and 20102012 .",
    "the primary goal of these observations was searching for lines of the direct - escape emission from the radioactive decay of @xmath3ti in the remnant of supernova 1987a @xcite .",
    "the achieved long exposure allowed us to study for the first time this nearby galaxy with an unprecedent sensitivity in hard x - rays .",
    "note that this exposure was accumulated mainly during last two years thus the data of observations used in this paper were not taken into account in the last revisions of the _ integral / ibis / isgri _ all - sky survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we present sky images of the lmc in hard ( 2060 kev ) and standard ( 320 kev ) x - ray energy bands and the catalogue of all detected sources , including four newly discovered ones . also , we present broadband ( 3100 kev ) spectra of eight bright x - ray binaries located in this region ( for some of them such spectra are reported here for the first time ) .",
    "the statistical study of the population of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) in the lmc and the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) detected in this direction is published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in this work we used the data obtained with the _ jem - x _ @xcite and _ ibisisgri _ @xcite telescopes aboard the _ integral _ observatory @xcite .",
    "the _ ibis _",
    "telescope has a relatively wide field of view ( @xmath4 at zero response , @xmath5 fully coded field ) and moderate ( 12  fwhm ) angular resolution , that in combination with the high sensitivity in the 2060 kev band makes it to be the best instrument for deep surveys in hard x - rays .",
    "the _ jem - x _ telescope has smaller field of view ( 13  in diameter at zero response ) , but slightly better angular resolution ( @xmath6 ) . due to these reasons it was used as the secondary instrument for the survey in order to extend it below 20 kev .",
    "the total exposure for _ integral _ observations of the lmc field reaches currently @xmath0 ms ( the dead time - corrected exposure of _ ibis / isgri _ for the central part of the field is @xmath7 ms , for _ jem - x _ the effective exposure is smaller @xmath8 ms due to its smaller field of view ) .",
    "reduction of the _ ibis / isgri _ data was carried out using the methods described by @xcite , reduction of the data  with the standard _",
    "package version 9.0 .",
    "spectra of the detected sources were reconstructed by direct measurements of their fluxes in the images extracted in the narrow energy bands .    the sky area covered by the _ ibis / isgri _ survey",
    "was effectively restricted to the region for which achieved sensitivity was better than 1 mcrab ( @xmath9 ) at the @xmath10 significance level in the 2060 kev energy band .",
    "the angular size of this region is of about @xmath11 deg@xmath12 .",
    "the survey area as a function of flux for sources with @xmath13 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] .",
    "note that the central part of the survey ( with the area of @xmath14 deg@xmath12 ) , where the lmc is located , has been covered with a sensitivity better than @xmath15 mcrab in the same band .",
    "-source detection.[fig : area ] ]    one of the main purposes of this survey was searching for previously unknown sources .",
    "the detection threshold was estimated assuming gaussian statistics for pixel values in the accumulated ( mosaic ) sky image of the lmc .",
    "the total area of the image is @xmath16 deg@xmath12 and , taking the _ ibis _ angular resolution into account , we gathered @xmath17 independent pixels . with this assumption ,",
    "the formal detection threshold at the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath18 allows at most one false detection .",
    "however , the very deep _ ibis / isgri _ mosaic images may be affected by a systematic noise or some artifacts caused by the imperfect sky reconstruction @xcite . in spite of the absence of strong apparent systematic noise",
    "( see fig.[fig : sign_distr ] ) we set a more conservative threshold @xmath19 , that diminishes the probability of the false detection by a factor more than 10 .    to obtain an accurate localization of newly revealed hard x - ray sources we used data from the follow - up observations performed with the _ xrt _ telescope aboard",
    "the _ swift _ observatory @xcite .",

    "we present results of the deep hard x - ray survey of the lmc field carried out with the _ integral _ observatory in the period 20032012 for a total exposure of @xmath0 ms .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    * during this survey 20 x - ray sources were detected by _",
    "ibis / isgri _ in the 2060 kev band at the significance level @xmath13 with one more source being detected by the _ jem - x _ telescope only in the 320 kev band . in total",
    "jem - x _ detected 10 sources .",
    "* ten of these 21 sources belong to the lmc ( 7 hmxbs , 2 psrs , 1 lmxb ) , six sources have an extragalactic origin , two belong to our galaxy , and one more  to the small magellanic cloud .",
    "two sources are still unidentified . *",
    "four new hard x - ray sources were discovered in this survey and reported here for the first time : two of them are extragalactic objects , the nature of other two sources is still needed to be established .",
    "one more source , igrj05414 - 6858 , discovered during this survey has been reported earlier .",
    "* we report for the first time the detection of hard x - rays from the crab - like pulsar psrj0537 - 6910 . * the source igrj05305 - 6559 detected by _",
    "integral _ in the close vicinity of the very bright x - ray pulsar lmcx-4 is most likely to be identified with the high - mass x - ray binary exo053109 - 6609 .",
    "* broadband spectra ( 3100 kev ) of 8 bright sources are presented and analyzed . for three of these sources such",
    "spectra are reproduced and presented for the first time .",
    "all three sources are belong to the class of hmxbs , two of them have a similar spectral shape  power law with an exponential cutoff and one more  simple power law ( probably owing to a lack of statistic ) .",
