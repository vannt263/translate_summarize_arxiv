    "the possibility of detecting gravitational waves through pulsar timing , first suggested independently by @xcite and @xcite , is of increasing interest as part of the birth of gravitational wave astronomy , and the details of this technique continue to be advanced by several researchers @xcite .",
    "the basis of this detection technique is the effect that a gravitational wave has on the arrival times of pulsar signals . in the analysis of this effect @xcite",
    ", the gravitational wave has been described in terms of perturbations @xmath0 of the spacetime metric @xmath1 .",
    "this description of gravitational waves is analogous to describing electromagnetic waves using the potentials @xmath2 . in particular , coordinate transformations",
    "are analogous to the gauge transformations of electromagnetic theory , and  at least in linearized general relativity  are also called gauge transformations .    if electromagnetic fields are to be described in terms of potentials , then one must choose a particular gauge for the description .",
    "similarly in relativistic gravity , coordinate conditions ( `` gauge fixing '' ) must be added .",
    "the need for a gauge choice gives rise to the possibility of confusing a gauge effect with a physical effect .",
    "this confusion , for relativistic gravity , kept it a controversial question for many years whether gravitational waves were physical , or were coordinate waves @xcite .",
    "a further source of confusion has been the distinction between the doppler shift due to gravitational waves , and the doppler shift due to relative motion of the emitting pulsar and the receiving telescope .",
    "this has the potential to be particularly confusing , since the relative motion is a manifestation of spacetime curvature , as is the gravitational wave .",
    "our purpose here is to clarify the description of pulsar timing , by analyzing pulsar timing with particular attention to what aspects of the pulsar doppler shift are gauge dependent and what aspects are physical .",
    "what we will show is that pulsar timing can be analyzed in a way in which there is an incontrovertible contribution due to gravitational waves , and a contribution due to relative motion of emitter and receiver .",
    "the result is couched completely in terms of quantities that are intuitively appealing , as well as mathematically well defined .",
    "the gravitational wave contribution will be based on the riemann tensor which is gauge invariant very much as are the electric and magnetic fields in classical electromagnetism .",
    "we will see , moreover , that in the literature there are claims about doppler shift effects that are not gauge invariant , but that these statements refer to intermediate steps in the analysis of pulsar timing and do not affect the overall program of pulsar timing .",
    "the technique of gravitational wave detection by pulsar timing is physically valid ; it is cleanly distinguishable both from coordinate effects and from source / receiver motions .",
    "besides clarifying what is and is not physically meaningful in pulsar timing , this paper helps to establish a firm background for studying the nonstandard polarization modes of alternative theories of gravitation , modes for which pulsar - timing detection may be particularly useful .",
    "such modes are most easily described in terms of components of the riemann tensor , not in terms of metric perturbations .",
    "the paper is organized with sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugeinv ] as its mathematical heart . in that section",
    "we derive the expressions that form the basis of our analysis , and that show clearly what is and what is not gauge invariant in pulsar timing . to help focus on the distinction between kinematic and gravitational effects , in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugeinv ] we assume that the motions of the emitter and the receiver of pulses are driven by nongravitational forces .",
    "we remedy this unphysical assumption in sec .",
    "[ sec : pngravity ] , where we add gravity as the source of the astrophysical motions of the emitter and receiver . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we discuss the implications of these results for the way in which pulsar - timing gravitational wave detection is to be carried out , and is to be viewed . in the appendix we fill in some details of sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugeinv ] that we thought would divert too much attention from the main point of that section .",
    "we have chosen to present these results with a minimum of unnecessary generality that would make the mathematics more elegant , but more obscure . except",
    "as noted , we use the notation and conventions of the text by @xcite .",
    "the doppler shift from emitter to observer can be considered to have two sources : ( i )  general relativisitic : the effects of gravitational waves , and ( ii )   special relativistic : the relative motion of emitter and receiver .",
    "the second effect will be much larger than the first in astrophysical situations .",
    "the relative velociy of astrophysical bodies is on the order of @xmath3 ( in @xmath4 units ) , while the characteristic magnitude of gravitational waves is smaller than @xmath5 , usually much smaller . in our development",
    "we keep special relatistic effects to all orders of @xmath6 , but we will ignore effects of order @xmath7 .",
    "the justification is that gravitational effects will be at the limit of detectibility ; effects that are smaller by @xmath8 are not of immediate interest . here and below we will use @xmath6 to denote an astrophysical velocity , and we will repeatly use the fact that @xmath7 can be ignored .    as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , here we will make the artificial assumption that the emitter and receiver are point particles that are being driven in accelerated motions by nongravitational forces , such as rocket engines . in the current section , then , the only curvature of spacetime is due to gravitational waves",
    ".    we will denote our emitter worldline as e , and receiver worldline as r. we choose minkowski background coordinates @xmath9 for the background so that they are appropriate for the approximations just discussed .",
    "that is , in these coordinates the e and r worldlines are at rest aside from velocities of order @xmath6 , and the metric perturbations @xmath10 due to gravitational waves are extremely small .",
    "the 4-momentum of a photon from emission to reception is written as @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 plays the role of a unit vector pointing ( in the minkowski background ) from the emitter to the receiver .",
    "we now consider the following expression @xmath13^r -\\left[u^{t}-n_ku^{k}\\right]^e \\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the 4-velocity of of the emitter ( e ) and receiver ( r ) , at the events of emission and reception ; @xmath15 indicates integration along the photon worldline , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; latin indices are spatial ( referring to the @xmath18 components of the coordinate basis ) .    in the appendix",
    "we show that the expression in eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) represents the doppler shift of the photon , that is , the fractional difference by which the photon energy observed by the receiver is greater than that observed by the emitter . here",
    "we focus on the gauge property of the expression , the changes induced in the expression by a coordinate transformation @xmath19 in which the gauge vector @xmath20 is of the order of the metric perturbations @xmath10 .",
    "the standard gauge transformations of the perturbations and of the components of the 4-velocities are @xmath21 we now note that the 4-velocities have the components @xmath22 aside from corrections of order @xmath6 . with terms of order @xmath23 ignored",
    "we are left with @xmath24 we also note that in eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) a gauge change in @xmath12 would give terms of order @xmath23 and @xmath25 , so no gauge transformation of @xmath12 is carried out .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows the gauge invariance of dopp : @xmath26^{\\rm r } -\\left[\\xi_{t ,",
    "t}+n^j\\xi_{j , t}\\right]^{\\rm r}\\]]@xmath27^{\\rm r } -\\left[\\xi_{t , t}+n^j\\xi_{j , t}\\right]^{\\rm r } = 0\\,.\\ ] ] ( it is worth noting here that time derivatives of @xmath12 can be ignored since these time derivatives are of order @xmath6 and would be multiplied by terms of order @xmath28 . )    since the doppler shift , as defined , refers to an objective physical measurement , the fact that it is gauge invariant is simply a consistency requirement .",
    "the details of the gauge transformation , however , underscore an important point : neither the integral nor the 4-velocity contributions to eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) is separately gauge invariant .",
    "thus , the temptation to identify the integral in eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) as the gravitational wave contribution and the 4-velocity terms as the kinetic contribution must be avoided , since that identification has no invariant meaning .    to arrive at a more physically useful expression we take the derivate of eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) with respect to the coordinate time @xmath29 .",
    "( in doing this we note again that @xmath30 is of order @xmath6 , and hence that time differentiation of @xmath12 in the integral can be ignored . )",
    "the result of time differentiation is : @xmath31^r -\\left[\\frac{du^{t}}{dt}-n_j\\frac{du^{j}}{dt}-\\frac{dn_j}{dt}u^j\\right]^e\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a few comments here on the time differentiation are appropriate .",
    "the total time derivative of the integral should , in principle , include the change in the integral due to the change of the time of the end points of the integral .",
    "but this change involves @xmath6 , and hence terms of order @xmath7 which we ignore .",
    "the time changing endpoints , on the other hand , can not be ignored in the 4-velocity terms , since these terms are not multipled by metric perturbations .",
    "the time derivatives @xmath32 in the 4-velocity terms are therefore understood to be the derivatives along the worldlines , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "next we consider the components of the 4-acceleration @xmath34 of the e and r worldlines @xmath35 where we have ignored terms of order @xmath7 in the @xmath36 term , and where @xmath37 , as usual , represents @xmath38 when these equations are used in eq .",
    "( [ ddoppdt ] ) we get @xmath39^r -\\left[\\frac{a^t - n_ja^j}{\\gamma}\\right]^e + \\left[-u_j\\,\\frac{dn^j}{dt}\\right]^r -\\left[-u_j\\,\\frac{dn^j}{dt}\\right]^e\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath40^r -\\left[\\frac{a^t - n_ja^j}{\\gamma}\\right]^e + \\left[-u_j\\,\\frac{dn^j}{dt}\\right]^r -\\left[-u_j\\,\\frac{dn^j}{dt}\\right]^e\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 represents the components of the riemann tensor .    the expression in eq .",
    "( [ ddoppdt2 ] ) is , of course , gauge invariant , but unlike the gauge invariant expression in eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) , the individual contributions are now gauge invariant .",
    "the integrand contains only a projection of the manifestly gauge invariant riemann tensor .",
    "the 4-velocity and 4-acceleration terms are all of first or higher order in @xmath6 , so their gauge changes would be of order @xmath7 , and hence ignorable .",
    "unlike the the expression in eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) , for the doppler shift , the expression in eq .",
    "( [ ddoppdt2 ] ) for the _ time derivative _ of the doppler shift contains contributions that have physical gauge - invariant meaning ; the integral gives the effect of gravitational waves and the remaining terms give the special relativistic contributions due to acceleration ( the 4-acceleration terms ) and to the relative geometry of the worldlines ( the @xmath30 terms ) .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : gaugeinv ] we assumed that the motions of the emitter and receiver were driven by nongravitational forces ( `` rocket engines '' ) , so that the role of spacetime curvature lay solely in the perturbations @xmath10 identified as gravitational waves . in reality , of course , astrophysical orbital motions are driven by gravity . in this section",
    "we explain how to incorporate other aspects of gravity , in particular , orbital forces , into the considerations of sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugeinv ] .",
    "we imagine now that the emitter and receiver are on astrophysical bodies that are moving under the influence of other astrophysical bodies . we have already assumed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugeinv ] that orbital velocities are small compared to @xmath42 .",
    "this means that the gravitational interactions among all bodies are weak - field interactions .",
    "more precisely , for our system of gravitationally interacting bodies , the newtonian potential @xmath43 due to one body , at the position of the other body , must be small compared to @xmath44 .",
    "we now make the additional assumption that the gravitational field is weak ( @xmath45 ) everywhere along the photon path .",
    "this allows us to treat all non - gravitational - wave fields relevant to the problem as being adequately described by a post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation @xcite .",
    "though we may consider a higher order pn approximation , we do not consider orders high enough ( order @xmath46 ) for the orbiting bodies themselves to become sources of gravitational radiation .    in a pn approximation ,",
    "a background minkowski - like coordinate system is used , and metric perturbations in terms of these potentials are required to have `` post - newtonian '' character @xcite .",
    "this character requires , among other things , that the potentials be functions only of the coordinate separation of source point and field point .",
    "the equations determining the metric perturbations are computed from einstein s equations truncated to the order of the pn approximation being used .",
    "gravitationally driven motions are then taken to be the geodesics of the pn metric , and may be interpreted as having accelerations in the flat background .    due to the nature of the pn approach",
    ", a pn gauge vector @xmath47 would have to have pn character .",
    "this very strong constraint turns out to leave almost no gauge freedom .",
    "moreover , there is a standard pn coordinate system  @xcite in which even the small gauge freedom is removed .",
    "when this gauge is adopted , the question of pn gauge transformations ceases to exist .",
    "gauge transformations can still be made , of course .",
    "the @xmath10 gravitational wave metric perturbations do _ not _ have pn character .",
    "so long as our gauge field @xmath47 is not pn in character it is clearly separable from any choice of pn gauge , and does not affect the construction of pn coordinates .",
    "again we note that this presumes that we ignore any contribution to the @xmath10 field of gravitational waves from the pn - modelled bodies themselves .    with these considerations",
    "we can conclude that the gauge transformations of sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugeinv ] can be repeated in the pn plus gravitational wave spacetime , with the accelerations taken as those ( relative to the minkowski background ) coming from pn theory .",
    "one might worry that the gravitational wave gauge transformations in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugeinv ] were made relative to a flat background , while the pn spacetime is not flat .",
    "but this simply means that we are ignoring terms of order @xmath48 , which are analogous to the terms of order @xmath49 that we ignored in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugeinv ] .",
    "though we are primarily interested here in gauge questions , the matter of the pn metric perturbations raises an important separate issue .",
    "the photon s doppler shift will be affected by the surface gravitational field of the emitter and receiver .",
    "in addition , if the the photon happens to pass close to a another astrophysical body the pn fields of that other body will affect pulsar time - of - arrivals by altering photon path lengths and through the shapiro time delay @xcite .",
    "these effects can be separately evaluated ( as part of a pn calculation ) and added to the doppler shift calculations of sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugeinv ] .",
    "since the effects are small , they do not `` mix '' with the @xmath10 terms .",
    "we close this short section by pointing out that there are limits to the clean separation of kinematic and gravitational wave terms .",
    "if the gravitational fields are strong , if orbital velocities are relativistic , or gravitational potentials along the photon path are of order unity , then the gauge - invariance demonstration in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugeinv ] fails to hold .",
    "indeed , it is intuitively appealing that in such a case it should not be possible to make a general distinction between small perturbations of spacetime and motions of astrophysical bodies .",
    "it would sill be possible , of course , to make a practical distinction between the two if the gravitational waves had a significantly higher frequency than the time scale of the kinematics .",
    "a physical measurement , such as the doppler shift of a photon , is not changed by the changes in our mathematical choices , so the gauge invariance of the expression in eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) is simply a check of consistency .",
    "what _ is _ subject to our mathematical choices is the interpretation of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) , in particular the interpretation of the integral term as the gravitational wave contribution .",
    "this interpretation is clearly incorrect since we could , for example , choose coordinates that makes the integral vanish for any photon , and put all of the doppler shift into the kinetic term .",
    "though integrals like that in eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) have appeared in the literature @xcite in discussions of pulsar timing , in practice , this causes no real difficulty .",
    "the doppler shift can be understood to be the time integral of the gauge invariant expression in eq .",
    "( [ ddoppdt ] ) .",
    "that time integral will contain an integration constant that can not be meaningfully separated into gravity and kinematics .",
    "the observed phase of the arriving pulses , the raw data of pulsar timing , will be the next time integral , and will contain a term @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are such integration constants . these integration - constant terms play no role in the actual analysis of timing residuals .",
    "the program of gravity wave detection by pulsar timing , therefore , has a solid physical foundation based on the riemann tensor .",
    "this relationship of timing residuals to the riemann tensor has a useful secondary benefit .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , pulsar timing has the potential to be a particularly sensitive probe of non - einsteinian polarization modes of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the description of these modes uses the components of the riemann tensor .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "( [ ddoppdt ] ) gives a clear and unequivocal description of how these nonstandard gravitational waves affect pulsar timing residuals .",

    "we also thank the nasa center for gravitational wave astronomy at university of texas at brownsville .",
    "we thank kejia lee for useful discussions of this work .",
    "and r@xmath53 , and of the minkowski - like coordinates . ]",
    "we now turn to a proof , needed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaugeinv ] , that the expression in eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) is the doppler shift . since we have shown that the expression in eq .",
    "( [ doppwithu ] ) is gauge invariant , it suffices to show that it is equal to doppler shift in any one gauge .",
    "we construct a convenient gauge for this proof as follows .",
    "we let * e * and * r * be the emission and reception events for a pulsar photon .",
    "we choose a timelike geodesic worldline e@xmath53 through * e * to be almost tangent ( i.e. , tangent to order @xmath54 ) , at * e * , to the emitter worldline .",
    "next we choose a timelike geodesic worldline r@xmath53 through * r * in such a way that it is parallel to the geodesic worldline through * e * in the following sense . near the emission event we construct a spacelike surface orthogonal to the emitter 4-velocity , and we construct this surface to have extrinsic curvature with a vanishing trace .",
    "we generate ( much in the manner of gaussian normal coordinates ) a congruence of timelike geodesic worldlines normal to this surface .",
    "we assume that the spacetime curvature is small enough , and/or the emitter - receiver distance is small enough that this congruence fills spacetime , with no crossings , in the neighborhood of the reception event .",
    "we choose r@xmath53 to be the curve in that congruence that goes through * r*.    the next step in the construction is to generate null geodesics ( photon worldlines ) from e@xmath53 to r@xmath53 and to define our minkowski coordinates @xmath55 by the following steps : ( i )  the surface spanned by the null geodesics is taken to be a surface of constant @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; ( ii )  @xmath58 is set to zero along e@xmath53 , and along r@xmath53 we set @xmath59 equal to another constant , the length of the spatial geodesic between e@xmath53 and r@xmath53 on the spatial hypersurface .",
    "( iii )  @xmath58 is taken to be an affine parameter along the null geodesics ; ( iv )  @xmath29 is taken to be proper time along e@xmath53 ; ( v )  the coordinate @xmath29 is propagated through the @xmath60 surface by requiring @xmath61 to be constant along the null geodesics , we note that a tangent to the null geodesics is given by @xmath62 in the coordinate system we have defined .      from this expression",
    "we have that the difference between the photon energies at * r * and * e * is @xmath66/p^t=- \\int_{\\rm e}^{\\rm r}\\left(\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}h_{tt , t}+h_{tz , t}+\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}h_{zz , t } \\right)\\,d\\lambda\\,.\\ ] ] we now generalize this to the case in which the photon is not confined to the plane with @xmath56 and @xmath57 constant . since the expression on the right in eq .",
    "( [ deltae ] ) is already first order in the metric perturbations , we need to consider only a more general photon direction in the minkowski background . if we denote by @xmath12 the unit vector pointing in the spatial direction in which the photon moves , then the generalization of eq .",
