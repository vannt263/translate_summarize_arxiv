    "the spin-@xmath0 model presented here could be realized in experiments with ultracold atoms or molecules in optical lattices , for which theoretical protocols have been designed to achieve four - spin interactions around plaquettes or vertices @xcite .",
    "it is challenging to design a theoretical protocol in which the excitations described here could be created and manipulated to test their non - trivial braiding and fusion properties .",
    "the construction i have described might be equivalent to string - net or generalized loop formalisms proposed in the literature . within the merging picture introduced here ,",
    "1 ) the non - abelian state is intuitively constructed by combining two abelian ground states , 2 ) the non - abelian braiding properties arise in a transparent way as the consequence of the indistinguishability of the abelian states that are merged , and 3 ) the parent hamiltonian is simple , involving four spin interactions with vertex and plaquette operators related by a unitary transformation , which seems to characterize the anyon model .",
    "moreover , the merging picture could be applied to describe _ chiral _ non - abelian phases , like those expected to occur in fractional quantum hall systems @xcite , for which it is unclear whether a string - net condensation picture is appropriate @xcite .",
    "indeed , the celebrated pfaffian state @xcite can be written as the result of merging two ( abelian ) laughlin states @xcite .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a unified picture , in which a non - abelian phase would arise from the combination of two or more abelian ones .",
