    "the wmap mission makes measurements of temperature with two antennas , a and b , and record in time - order the difference between the two antenna temperatures , @xmath0 , which is called the time - order data ( tod ) .",
    "the observed cmb signal is contaminated by doppler effect induced by the joint motion of the solar system and the spacecraft .",
    "the aroused dipole difference signal can be calculated by @xmath1 where @xmath2k is the cmb monopole , @xmath3 is the speed of light , @xmath4 is the joint velocity , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the unit direction vectors of the antenna a and b respectively  @xcite . in this paper",
    "the vectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are defined in the spacecraft coordinate system .",
    "the errors of line - of - sight ( los ) vector , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , will produce a pseudo - dipole difference signal @xmath12    the dipoles for each observations have to be removed from the raw data before map - making because their intensities are roughly 10 to 20 times greater than those of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "a small error of antenna direction will produce an error in predicted dipole intensity and then cause a pseudo - dipole signal in the resulting cmb map more noticeably through the doppler dipole subtraction process . for example , a los error of @xmath13 , just about a half - pixel in the wmap resolution , can consequently cause the dipole signal to be deviated by 1020@xmath14k , which can not be ignored compared to the very weak cmb signal .",
    "an asynchronous between the attitude and differential data can also produce the pseudo - dipole signal .",
    "the wmap mission uses two separate clocks for the attitude data and science data respectively .",
    "therefore , if there is a small constant timing error , there will be a constant direction difference between the `` observed pixel '' and the true pixel .",
    "this has the same effect as a constant los error in spacecraft coordinates @xcite .",
    "another possible source of pseudo - dipole signal in released wmap maps is the sidelobe signal contamination .",
    "like all radio telescopes , the wmap antennas have both main beam response and sidelobe response .",
    "the wmap antenna sidelobe response was described by @xcite and the corresponding data file is publicly available .",
    "the data files are fits format full sky maps in spacecraft coordinates in which the sidelobe responses are given in normalized gain @xmath15 , where the normalization rule is that the summation of all gains for one antenna ( including the main beam ) equals to @xmath16 , the number of pixels in the map .",
    "thus for each differential observation , the recorded difference signal is @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 denotes pixels corresponding to a certain sidelobe , then the overall sidelobe response is @xmath19 .",
    "the overall sidelobe response should contribute a pseudo component to the differential doppler signal @xmath20 the spacecraft los vectors and @xmath21 are all constant vectors in spacecraft coordinates .",
    "since @xmath15 are normalized gains , it can also be treated as constant .",
    "therefore we have two constant vectors : @xmath22 and @xmath23 . since the sidelobe gain is much smaller than the main lobe gain , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two small constant vectors , and @xmath26 by comparing eq .  2 and eq .  4",
    ", we can see that the entire sidelobe doppler pickup can be exactly described by a small constant deviation to the differential spacecraft los vector . similarly , the effect of the sidelobe response uncertainty on the differential doppler dipole is also equivalent to introducing a small differential los error @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to notice that , even if the los is absolutely accurate , this pseudo - dipole signal from the sidelobe response uncertainty can still exist .",
    "the amplitude of the equivalent los error induced by sidelobe doppler pickup can be estimated by @xmath28 , which are @xmath29 for different bands .",
    "the wmap team believes that the galactic sidelobe pickup is neglectable except for the k - band , the reason is largely that the galactic emission is much weaker in other bands than in the k - band  @xcite .",
    "the case is significantly different for the doppler signals because they have almost the same amplitude in all bands .",
    "moreover , the doppler signal is as strong as several mk all over the sky ; however , the galactic emission is strong only for the low galactic latitude and the strength decreases rapidly for higher latitude .",
    "thus the overall power of the doppler signal is about @xmath30 times higher than the overall galactic foreground emission power , and the effect of sidelobe doppler signal pickup is at least 10 times stronger than the sidelobe galactic pickup .",
    "the wmap antenna sidelobe gain patterns are estimated by ground - based measurements and in - flight lunar measurements .",
    "for the k - band , the wmap first - year in - flight gain measurements are @xmath31 systematically brighter than ground - based measurements .",
    "the wmap team scaled up the ground - based measurements by @xmath32 and scaled down the lunar results by @xmath32 to yield a best - guess sidelobe gain map with an overall calibration uncertainty @xmath33",
    "@xcite , thus the amplitude of the equivalent los error induced by the sidelobe doppler pickup uncertainty could be up to @xmath34 ( estimated by @xmath35 ) , which is much more than enough to produce considerable pseudo - dipole contamination . from the wmap releases we find that the wmap7 sidelobe file is exactly the same with wmap1 for the k - band , and for other bands the sidelobe files of a single survey year are just slightly changed from year-1 to year-7 , indicating that their uncertainties have not been essentially improved and can not be ignored",
    "the approach we use to remove the pseudo - dipole signal is same to the wmap foreground removal .",
    "different effects arising foreground are separately modeled with template maps : the 94ghz dust map @xmath36 for dust emission  @xcite , the full - sky h@xmath37 map @xmath38 for free - free emission  @xcite , and the synchrotron template @xmath39 derived from k , ka bands for synchrotron emission  @xcite .",
    "the foreground emission is removed by the wmap team  @xcite with model fitting to get the clean temperature @xmath40 where the coefficients @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 are determined by weighted fitting to make @xmath44 .",
    "the pseudo - dipole signal in wmap temperature maps can be removed with the same approach for foreground contamination .",
    "the overall effect of the three systematics mentioned in  1 and  2 , los error , time drift , and sidelobe doppler pickup , can be generally described by an equivalent deviation @xmath45 of the differential antenna direction .",
    "the deviation induced by the pseudo - dipole signal in a released wmap map can be easily modeled . for each measured temperature difference in the tod used to produce the map , we substitute the pseudo - dipole signal calculated by eq .  2 for an assumed @xmath45 to produce a new tod .",
    "the temperature map produced by map making from the new tod can be used as a model of the pseudo - dipole signal in the released map . in calculation",
    "we use the spacecraft coordinate system @xmath46 , where the @xmath47 axis is parallel to plane of radiators , @xmath48 is the anti - sun direction of the spin axis , and @xmath49 is perpendicular to both .",
    "the wmap spacecraft scans the sky with a hybrid motion mode consists of rotation and precessing . in spacecraft coordinates , the los unit vectors of its two antennas are close to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the spacecraft rotation is around the @xmath52-axis .",
    "suppose the overall los error @xmath45 from all such effects is made up of three small vectors @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 with @xmath56 , each alone on the final map induces its own full - sky distribution of deviation @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the induced deviation upon the released wmap7 year-1 q1-band map , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are shown in fig .",
    "1 . results for other years and other bands are similar .",
    "it is easy to see from fig .  1 that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are highly correlated .",
    "in order to avoid degeneracy issue we only use @xmath57 and @xmath58 in model fitting . the clean full sky temperature map @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the corresponding wmap cmb temperature map and the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be determined by minimizing @xmath64 . using the standard idl program `` regress '' we get @xmath65 , @xmath66 for the wmap7 year-1 q1-band map .",
    "we also model and remove the pseudo - dipole signal from the released wmap7 year-1 to year-7 maps of q1 , q2 , v1 , v2 , w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 bands , separately and @xmath58 are derived from wmap7 year-1 q1 band , then they are used to fit the wmap7 year-1 q1 band single year cmb temperature map .",
    "the wmap7 single year cmb temperature maps can be found at http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr4/maps_forered_da_r9_i_1yr_get.cfm . ] . from the clean maps",
    "we calculate their power spectra and residual quadruples .",
    "table 1 lists the obtained residual quadrupoles of different bands .",
    "the overall average clean quadrupole power for all bands is found to be @xmath67 , only @xmath68 of what released by the wmap team for quadrupole ) at http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/map/powspec/wmap_binned_tt_powspec_yr1_v1p1.txt . although the wmap team never gave a pseudo - cl quadrupole in later releases , we have tested and made sure that this value is almost the same in all releases from wmap1 to wmap7 . ] , indicating that most of the published wmap cmb quadrupole is artificial .",
    "table 1 : the residual quadrupole power ( @xmath14k@xmath69 ) +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have found that at least three systematical effects inducing pseudo - dipole signal in wmap raw differential temperature data can be summarized into a uniform description : the equivalent differential direction error @xmath45",
    ". there could be more sources with similar attributes to these three , but they can all be covered equivalently by a simple @xmath45 .",
    "for example , the los is determined by observing the jupiter ; however , for each observation , the relative direction of jupiter provides no more than three conditions : @xmath70 , but we need four conditions to definitely determine the attitude of the spacecraft : @xmath70 and rotation .",
    "what s more , the los is determined together with the antenna main beam response ; therefore , the uncertainty of the beam response is also mixed into the los uncertainty . moreover",
    ", even the wmap team themselves have found that some systematical effect can produce quadrupole - like deviations on the final cmb map ( jarosik et al .",
    "2007 , fig .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out that a small timing error during the step of calibration of the raw tod could correspond to adding a pseudo - dipole difference signal with no effect on positional data .",
    "it is impossible to exactly estimate all such effects , especially when some of them could be unknown for now , but it is easy to model the impact of @xmath45 upon the final cmb map and remove it by model fitting .",
    "this is apparently much more feasible and effective than estimating and removing all possible sources one by one .",
    "what is important for model fitting is the feature of a template map , not the absolute amplitude .",
    "for example , the wmap foreground removal will be the same even if the three foreground templates @xmath36 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are all doubled . in this work ,",
    "the result of removing pseudo - dipole signal is not dependent to what amplitude is assumed for the direction error : larger amplitude leads to lower fitted coefficient in model fitting and the final correction to the cmb map is the same .",
    "here it is worth to mention that the characteristic feature of template map of the pseudo - dipole signal induced by a pointing or timing error obtained from our previous work @xcite or shown in fig .  1 of this work has already been confirmed by other independent works @xcite .",
    "our result demonstrates that a pseudo - dipole field can produce deviations in the sky temperature map with a structure very similar to the cmb quadrupole pattern published by the wmap team .",
    "the template map of pseudo - dipole induced temperature deviation shown in fig .",
    "1 are generated from a differential dipole field which is completely determined by the spacecraft velocity and overall - equivalent error of differential direction without using any cmb signal .",
    "the pseudo - dipole signal in the differential datum for a wmap observation distorts the temperatures for corresponding sky pixels varying observation by observation .",
    "therefore , the pseudo - dipole induced temperature map is generated by the pseudo - dipole signal combined with the wmap scan pattern , which is highly relative to the ecliptic plane  @xcite .",
    "the wmap cmb quadrupole component being highly aligned and close to the ecliptic plane is a long time puzzle in cosmology , which now can be naturally explained by the pseudo - dipole signal effect . keeping insist that the published wmap quadrupole is really cosmological origin",
    "now becomes more difficult : it is needed the primordial density fluctuations not only occasionally being laid down in the plane of the solar system , but also occasionally having almost the same phase as the scan strategy of the wmap mission !",
