    "the art of controlling josephson current transport through mesoscopic superconducting junctions poses many challenges for theory and experiment from both fundamental and applied points of view .",
    "@xcite control of josephson current requires multi - terminal devices - superconducting transistors .",
    "one example is the josephson field effect transistor ( jofet ) , @xcite where control of the josephson _ equilibrium _",
    "current is imposed via an electrostatic gate .",
    "another solution is to connect the normal region to a normal voltage biased reservoir .",
    "recent progress in fabrication of superconducting junctions has brought forward a number of interesting multiterminal structures , e.g. 2deg , junctions@xcite metallic junctions , @xcite and high - tc junctions .",
    "@xcite    injection of electrons and holes allows nonequilibrium quasiparticle distributions to be maintained in the n - region , making it possible to control the _ nonequilibrium _ josephson current .",
    "the problem of nonequilibrium current injection in ballistic junctions is of particular interest : the josephson current is transported through bands of andreev levels.@xcite this provides means for achieving a dramatic variation of the josephson current .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a broad description of josephson current transport through ballistic sns junctions under conditions of nonequilibrium in the normal region due to contact with a voltage biased normal reservoir .",
    "connection of the normal part of an sns junction to a normal electron reservoir gives rise to broadening of the andreev bound levels .",
    "van wees et al .",
    "@xcite were the first ones to consider this broadening in perfect sns junctions and to describe essential aspects of the variation of the josephson current with voltage , in terms of nonequilibrium population of andreev levels .",
    "moreover , wendin and shumeiko @xcite have predicted that nonequilibrium filling of andreev levels may reveal very large josesphson currents with different directions , and that pumping between levels could reverse the direction of the josephson current .",
    "this has been investigated in detail by bagwell and coworkers @xcite and by samuelsson et al .",
    "@xcite .    recently , morpurgo et al .",
    "@xcite observed andreev levels by using the injection lead as a spectroscopic probe .",
    "suppression of the josephson current due to injection has been demonstrated in both ballistic @xcite and diffusive sns junctions @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism of the effect in diffusive junctions is essentially the same as in ballistic junctions.@xcite very recently , baselmans et .",
    "@xcite were able also to reverse the direction of the josephson current .",
    "a decisive step beyond the work of van wees et al .",
    "@xcite was taken by samuelsson et al .",
    "@xcite , who showed that an essential aspect is the ability of the scatterer at the injection point to shift the phases of the quasiparticles .",
    "in such a case , the connection to the injection lead also affects the form of the wave function of the andreev resonances , and therefore affects josephson currents flowing through the resonances . as a result , modification of the josephson current under injection does not reduce to the effect of non - equilibrium population .",
    "this is particularly dramatic for long junctions , where the equilibrium josephson current is exponentially small at finite temperature .",
    "@xcite    in contrast , this _ anomalous _ nonequilibrium josephson current does not depend on the length of the junction ( long - range josephson effect ) .",
    "this means that , in principle , a dissipationless current of the order of the equilibrium josephson current of a short junction can be restored under conditions of filling up all the andreev levels in the gap .",
    "the effect is most pronounced in junctions with a small number of transport modes .",
    "this opens up the possibility for a new kind of josephson transistor where the supercurrent is turned on when the gate voltage is switched from @xmath7 to @xmath8.@xcite    the complete picture of the nonequilibrium current also includes the current injected into the junction .",
    "this _ injection _",
    "current is dependent on the properties of the andreev levels in the junction .",
    "it therefore provides information on the nonequilibrium josephson current .",
    "we found that it is closely related to the anomalous current and has similar properties .",
    "the injection current has also in itself been at the focus of great interest in recent literature .",
    "@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath9 we present a general discussion of the currents in a 3-terminal sns device . in section",
    "@xmath10 we describe our model based on the stationary bdg equation .",
    "we derive all currents in the case of a three terminal junction without barriers at the ns - interface in section @xmath11 . in section @xmath12 we discuss the equilibrium and nonequilibrium josephson currents , both in a short and long junctions .",
    "the effect of barriers at the ns - interfaces is discussed in section @xmath13 and the injection current and the conductance are analyzed in section @xmath14 . in section @xmath15 we discuss the four terminal junction and how it differs from the three terminal one . finally , in section @xmath16 we present our conclusions .",
    "we will consider two junction configurations : 3- and 4-terminal ( see fig .",
    "[ juncfig ] ) . the normal part of the junction is inserted between two superconducting electrodes .",
    "the superconducting electrodes are connected with each other to form a loop and the magnetic flux threading the loop allows us to control the phase difference @xmath17 across the junction .",
    "we consider a junction in the ballistic limit , i.e when the length @xmath18 of the normal part of the junction is shorter then both the elastic and inelastic scattering lengths , @xmath19 .",
    "the 3-terminal configuration is an elementary structure which gives all necessary information for understanding also the properties of the 4-terminal junction , to be discussed below .",
    "we use a simplified description of the connection point , modeling it by a scattering matrix @xmath20 that connects ingoing and outgoing wave function amplitudes @xcite @xmath21 with    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are reflection and transmission amplitudes for scattering between lead 2 to lead 3 and @xmath25 is the scattering amplitude from the injection lead 1 to lead 2 or 3 . in a multichannel treatment , @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "become matrices describing the scattering between the channels . in this paper",
    "we however choose to consider a single - mode structure .    in the junction presented in fig .",
    "[ juncfig ] , the current @xmath28 injected into the junction from the normal reservoir splits at the connection point . at the ns - interfaces , the normal current is converted into a supercurrent .",
    "the supercurrent flows around the loop and is drained at a point connected to the normal reservoir via a voltage source biased at voltage @xmath12 .",
    "there are two major questions about the currents : ( i ) what is the current @xmath28 in injection electrode 1 as function of the applied voltage , and ( ii ) how is the current split between the arms 2 and 3 .",
    "the first problem has been discussed earlier , @xcite the picture is the following : due to andreev quantization the problem is equivalent to a resonant transmission problem . for weak coupling to the normal reservoir , @xmath29 , the probability of an incoming electron to be reflected is large unless its energy coincides with an andreev level . in such a case",
    ", the electron is back scattered as a hole which produces a current density peak .",
    "the current as a function of applied voltage between the normal reservoir and the junction ( ivc ) thus increases stepwise , typical for resonant transport , with position and height of the steps depending on the phase difference between the superconductors .",
    "the current distribution among the left and right arms of the junction is also phase dependent .",
    "however , there is a less trivial aspect of the problem related to the josephson current in the loop .",
    "there is no possibility to distinguish the josephson current which flows along the loop ( as the result of an applied phase difference ) from the split injection current _ except _ in the limit of weak coupling to the external reservoir . in the limit @xmath29",
    "the injection current @xmath30 vanishes while the josephson current remains finite .",
    "this allows us to separate the problem of the josephson current under injection from the problem of splitting of the injection current .",
    "the scattering states carrying the current can qualitatively be described as electrons or holes entering the sns junction from the injection lead 1 , being split at the connection point , scattered back and forth in the junction by andreev reflections at the ns - interfaces and normal reflections at the connection point , and then finally leaving the junction , having effectively transported current from one superconductor to the other .",
    "when the lifetime of the andreev resonances is smaller than the inelastic scattering time in the junction , the quasiparticle distribution in the normal region is determined by the fermi distribution function of the normal reservoir , and the current in the leads @xmath31 or @xmath32 from injected quasiparticles can be written    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the current density for injected electrons ( holes ) and @xmath35 are the fermi distribution functions in the normal reservoir , with @xmath36^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this current can conveniently be rewritten    @xmath37=i^+_j+i^-_j \\label{curreq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "quasiparticles are also injected from the superconductors for energies above the superconducting gap .",
    "since the superconductors are grounded ( @xmath40 ) , the current from the superconductors is an equilibrium current .",
    "this current plus the current @xmath41 injected from the normal reservoir in absence of applied voltage , is the total _ equilibrium _",
    "applying a bias voltage @xmath42 , @xmath43 becomes the _ nonequilibrium _",
    "current due to population of the empty andreev levels , giving rise to current jumps when the injection energy @xmath44 equals the andreev level energies ( see fig .",
    "[ spectro ] ) .",
    "this makes it possible to probe the energy of the andreev levels .",
    "@xcite    the @xmath45 part of the current is entirely nonequilibrium current .",
    "it partly consists of the injection current ; however , there is also a component which does not vanish in the limit of weak coupling to the reservoir : we call this the _ anomalous josephson current_. @xcite this current results from a different form of the andreev resonance wave functions in the _ open _ junction compared with the wave functions of true andreev _ bound _ states",
    ". the origin of the anomalous current can qualitatively be described by considering the lowest order quasiparticle classical paths which contribute to the resonances in transparent junctions ( @xmath46 ) with perfect ns interfaces .",
    "consider a resonant state where the most of the electrons move to the left and the holes to the right , only a fraction of them travellling in the opposite direction due to normal scattering at the connection point .",
    "an injected electron gives rise to a leftgoing electron in lead 2 with the amplitude @xmath47 with @xmath17 ( not taking electron and hole dephasing and the energy dependent phase picked up when andreev reflecting into account ) thus giving a contribution to the current of the order @xmath48 ( see inset in fig . [ ccd2 ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , an injected hole gives rise to a rightgoing hole in lead 3 with amplitude @xmath49 and a contribution to the current of order @xmath50 ( see right figure in inset in fig .",
    "[ ccd2 ] ) .",
    "the difference current @xmath51 thus contains a part proportional to @xmath52=2\\mbox{im}(rd^*)\\sin(\\phi)$ ] , which is the leading term in the anomalous current . at a resonant state where the particles move in the opposite direction ,",
    "i.e the electrons to the right and the holes to the left , we find from the same arguments that the anomalous current is again proportional to @xmath53 , _ with the same sign_. the anomalous current thus flows in the same direction for all resonances , in contrast to the equilibrium josephsson current which changes sign from one level to the next .",
    "the ivc for @xmath45 is thus a staircase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spectro ] , saturating at @xmath54 due to the absence of sharp resonances for energies above the superconducting gap .",
    "this has a dramatic effect on the long range properties of the josephson current .    for a long junction @xmath55 , the ivc in fig .",
    "[ spectro ] becomes dense , since there is a large number @xmath56 of andreev levels in the junction .",
    "the spacing between the andreev levels is @xmath57 , so at temperatures exceeding the interlevel distance , the current @xmath43 is averaged to zero while @xmath45 is reduced to a smooth ramp function .",
    "we thus get a current @xmath45 that increases linearly with voltage up to @xmath8 and saturates at a level of the order of the equilibrium josephson current of a short junction , @xmath58 .",
    "this current is independent of the length of the junction , since there is a large number of levels @xmath59 each carrying a current @xmath60 .",
    "we consider a three - terminal junction with asymmetric current injection ( @xmath61 ) and perfect transmission at the ns interfaces .",
    "the junction can be described by the stationary 1-d bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation@xcite    @xmath62 \\psi = e \\psi \\hspace{1 cm } h_{0}=-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}-e_{f}\\ ] ]    which gives @xmath63 as a departure from @xmath64 .",
