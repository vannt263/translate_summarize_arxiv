    "supersymmetric gauge theories have attracted a lot of attention because , for example , some aspects of their dynamics are accessible to analytic methods . in particular , techniques from string theory can be applied to these systems . the @xmath1 yang - mills theory with @xmath2 supersymmetry describes the interactions between gluons and gluinos . here",
    "we investigate this model both at zero and at non - zero temperatures .",
    "of course , at non - zero temperatures supersymmetry is explicitly broken due to different boundary conditions for gluons and gluinos in the euclidean time direction .",
    "this is no problem because we will use methods of effective field theory that do not rely on supersymmetry . at low temperatures ,",
    "the theory is in a confined phase with a spontaneously broken @xmath3 chiral symmetry , while at high temperatures one expects chiral symmetry to be restored and gluons and gluinos to be deconfined . in the deconfined phase ,",
    "the @xmath4 center symmetry of the @xmath1 gauge group is spontaneously broken .",
    "in addition , at zero temperature gluons and gluinos may exist in a non - abelian coulomb phase without confinement or chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the existence of the coulomb phase is a controversial issue . for the rest of this paper",
    ", we assume that it exists .",
    "the rich phase structure gives rise to interesting effects related to the interfaces separating various bulk phases .",
    "due to spontaneous @xmath3 breaking , there are @xmath5 distinct confined phases with different values of the gluino condensate @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "these phases are separated by confined - confined interfaces .",
    "similarly , at high temperatures , @xmath4 breaking gives rise to @xmath5 deconfined phases with different values of the polyakov loop @xmath8 , @xmath9 , which are separated by deconfined - deconfined interfaces .",
    "assuming a first order phase transition , at @xmath0 there are , in addition , confined - deconfined interfaces . finally , at zero temperature , the confined phases can coexist with the coulomb phase , which has a vanishing gluino condensate @xmath10 .",
    "hence , there are also confined - coulomb interfaces .",
    "the properties of confined - coulomb and confined - confined interfaces at zero temperature have been studied in detail by shifman and collaborators @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the tension of an interface separating two bulk phases with gluino condensates @xmath11 and @xmath12 is constrained by the inequality @xmath13 if the interface represents a bps saturated state , this inequality is satisfied as an equality . indeed , confined - coulomb interfaces are bps saturated @xcite , such that @xmath14 the interface tensions determine the shape of a droplet of coulomb phase that wets a confined - confined domain wall . as shown in figure 1a , such a droplet forms a lens with opening angle @xmath15 , where @xmath16    this equation for @xmath15 follows from the forces at the corner of the lens being in equilibrium ( forming a stable configuration known as the neumann triangle in condensed matter literature @xcite ) . in condensed matter physics",
    "the inequality @xmath17 was derived by widom and is also known as antonoff s rule @xcite .",
    "it follows from thermodynamic stability because a hypothetical confined - confined domain wall with @xmath18 would simply split into two confined - coulomb interfaces . combining antonoff s rule with the bps inequality",
    ", one finds @xmath19 assuming bps saturation for confined - confined interfaces , the values of the interface tensions from above imply @xmath20 then , for odd @xmath5 , @xmath21 , such that the coulomb phase forms droplets at a confined - confined interface . in condensed matter physics",
    "this phenomenon is known as incomplete wetting . for even @xmath5 and for @xmath22 , on the other hand , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in that case , the lens shaped droplet degenerates to an infinite film , as shown in figure 1b .",
    "when such a film is formed , this is called complete wetting .",
    "for example , the human eye is completely wet by a film of tears that splits the eye - air solid - gas interface into a pair of solid - liquid and liquid - gas interfaces .",
    "complete wetting may occur when several bulk phases coexist with each other . for condensed matter systems",
    ", achieving phase coexistence usually requires fine - tuning of , for example , the temperature , to a first order phase transition . in supersymmetric theories , on the other hand ,",
    "drastically different phases , like confined and coulomb , may coexist at zero temperature , since their bulk free energies are identical due to supersymmetry .",
    "this implies that complete wetting appears naturally , i.e. without fine - tuning , in supersymmetric theories .",
    "complete wetting is a universal phenomenon of interfaces characterized by several critical exponents .",
    "for example , the width @xmath25 of the complete wetting layer diverges as @xmath26 where @xmath27 measures the deviation from the point of phase coexistence and @xmath28 is a critical exponent .",
    "the value of @xmath28 depends on the range of the interactions between the two interfaces that enclose the complete wetting layer . for condensed matter systems ,",
    "the interaction energy per unit area is often due to repulsive van der waals forces and is given by @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , away from @xmath0 the phase that forms the wetting layer has a slightly larger bulk free energy than the other phases .",
    "close to @xmath0 , the additional bulk free energy per unit area for a wetting layer of width @xmath25 is given by @xmath30 .",
    "hence , the total free energy per unit area of the two interface system relative to the free energy of two infinitely separated interfaces at @xmath0 is given by @xmath31 minimizing the free energy with respect to @xmath25 , one finds the equilibrium width @xmath32 such that @xmath33 . inserting the equilibrium value of @xmath25 one finds @xmath34 some condensed matter systems with interfaces interact via retarded van der waals forces with a potential @xmath35 , and thus have @xmath36 .",
    "as we will see , the confined - confined interfaces of the @xmath37 supersymmetric @xmath1 gauge theory , which are completely wet by the non - abelian coulomb phase , have the same critical exponent .",
    "complete wetting does not only occur in supersymmetric gauge theories , although only there it occurs naturally without fine - tuning .",
    "in fact , frei and patks conjectured that complete wetting occurs in the non - supersymmetric @xmath38 pure gauge theory at the high - temperature deconfinement phase transition @xcite . in the deconfined phase the @xmath39 center symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken .",
    "hence , there are three distinct high - temperature phases separated by deconfined - deconfined interfaces . when a deconfined - deconfined interface is cooled down to the phase transition , the low - temperature confined phase forms a complete wetting layer . in that case , the interactions between the interfaces are short - ranged , such that @xmath40 minimizing the free energy with respect to @xmath25 now gives @xmath41 such that @xmath42 . substituting the value of @xmath25 , one obtains @xmath43 this is the critical behavior that was observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "as we will see , the same exponents follow for the high - temperature deconfinement transition in the supersymmetric case .",
    "as argued before , for @xmath37 supersymmetric @xmath38 gauge theory ( and generally for odd @xmath5 ) complete wetting may occur at zero temperature only if confined - confined domain walls are not bps saturated .",
    "recently , we have shown that complete wetting occurs at the high - temperature deconfinement phase transition @xcite . in this case",
    ", a confined - confined interface is completely wet by one of the three deconfined phases when it is heated up to the phase transition .",
    "the occurrence of deconfined phase at the center of a confined - confined interface has interesting dynamical consequences .",
    "it implies that a static quark has a finite free energy close to such a domain wall and the string emanating from it can end at the wall .",
    "this effect was first derived by witten in the framework of m - theory @xcite .",
    "complete wetting provides a field theoretic explanation of the same effect without reference to string theory .",
    "here we concentrate on the derivation of the corresponding complete wetting critical exponents . as in the non - supersymmetric case , we find @xmath42 due to short - range interactions between interfaces .",
    "in @xmath37 supersymmetric @xmath1 gauge theory with even @xmath5 a confined - confined interface separating phases with gluino condensates @xmath11 and @xmath12 is completely wet by the non - abelian coulomb phase if @xmath44 . in this case ,",
    "antonoff s rule implies bps saturation of confined - confined domain walls .",
    "the simplest case we can consider is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ". the universal aspects of the interface dynamics can be derived from an effective action @xmath48 = \\int d^4 x \\ [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_\\mu \\chi \\partial_\\mu \\chi + v(\\chi)],\\ ] ] for the gluino condensate @xmath49 . under the @xmath50 chiral symmetry @xmath49 changes sign and @xmath51 .",
    "when the two confined phases coexist with the coulomb phase , @xmath52 has three degenerate minima , two at @xmath53 and one at @xmath54 .",
    "the confined phase is massive , and thus @xmath52 is quadratic around @xmath55 .",
    "the coulomb phase , on the other hand , is massless and @xmath52 turns out to be quartic around @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "a simple potential with these properties can be written as @xmath56 for our purposes it is not essential to use the actual potential of the supersymmetric theory .",
    "we are interested only in the universal complete wetting aspects of the interface dynamics .",
    "these are the same for the simple potential from above . for @xmath57",
    "there is a quartic minimum at @xmath54 corresponding to the coulomb phase . for @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "there are two other minima at @xmath60 corresponding to the two confined phases .",
    "phase coexistence corresponds to @xmath61 , because then all three minima are degenerate .",
    "we now look for solutions of the classical equation of motion representing static planar domain walls , i.e. @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the coordinate perpendicular to the wall .",
    "the equation of motion then takes the form @xmath64 the interface action per unit area and unit time gives the interface tension @xmath65 .",
    "figure 2 shows a numerical solution of the equation of motion for a domain wall separating the two confined phases with boundary conditions @xmath66 .",
    "figure 2a corresponds to a high temperature where only the confined phase is thermodynamically stable .",
    "then the interface profile interpolates directly between the two confined phases .",
    "figure 2b corresponds to an almost zero temperature where the coulomb phase is metastable .",
    "then the confined - confined domain wall splits into two confined - coulomb interfaces and the coulomb phase forms a complete wetting layer between them .",
    "figure 3 shows the width @xmath25 of the complete wetting layer as a function of the deviation @xmath67 from phase coexistence .",
    "one finds @xmath68 , such that the critical exponent is @xmath36 .",
    "this is the same value that one finds for condensed matter interfaces that interact via long - range retarded van der waals forces with a potential @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we have verified numerically that @xmath69 in agreement with the arguments presented in the introduction .",
    "the order parameter at the center of the wetting layer behaves as @xmath70 which defines another critical exponent .",
    "let us now turn to @xmath38 supersymmetric yang - mills theory . in that case ,",
    "complete wetting can occur at zero temperature only if confined - confined domain walls are not bps saturated . for the following discussion we will assume that they are not .",
    "the universal aspects of the interface dynamics are again captured by an effective action @xmath48 = \\int d^4 x \\ [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_\\mu \\chi^ * \\partial_\\mu \\chi + v(\\chi)],\\ ] ] but the gluino condensate @xmath71 is now a complex field .",
    "the effective potential @xmath52 is restricted by @xmath72 and charge conjugation symmetry . under chiral transformations @xmath73 ,",
    "the gluino condensate transforms into @xmath74 and under charge conjugation it gets replaced by its complex conjugate .",
    "this implies @xmath75 again , one needs the potential to be quadratic around the confined phase minima and quartic around the coulomb phase minimum .",
    "a simple potential with these properties is @xmath76 at zero temperature ( corresponding to @xmath61 ) , the above potential has four degenerate minima at @xmath77 , @xmath78 , representing the three confined phases and at @xmath79 representing the coulomb phase .",
    "again , we look for solutions of the classical equations of motion representing planar domain walls .",
    "figure 4 shows a numerical solution of these equations for a domain wall separating two confined phases with boundary conditions @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "figure 4a corresponds to a temperature deep in the confined phase . in this case , the coulomb phase is unstable and the domain wall interpolates directly from one confined phase to the other .",
    "figure 4b shows the situation at almost zero temperature .",
    "then the confined - confined domain wall splits into two confined - coulomb interfaces and the coulomb phase forms a complete wetting layer between them .    as in the @xmath45 case",
    ", we have determined the width of the complete wetting layer numerically .",
    "again , one finds @xmath68 , such that @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , @xmath82 , as it should be .",
    "the order parameter at the center of the wetting layer now behaves as @xmath83 again in agreement with the @xmath45 critical exponent .",
    "we conclude that the critical exponents are independent of @xmath5 and depend only on the range of the interface interactions . to summarize , at zero temperature complete wetting occurs for even @xmath5 and @xmath22 .",
    "for odd @xmath5 or @xmath84 complete wetting can occur only if confined - confined domain walls are not bps saturated .",
    "when a confined - confined domain wall is completely wet by the coulomb phase , the complete wetting layer grows with the fourth root of the deviation from the critical temperature .",
    "this is due to long - range interactions in the coulomb phase mediated by massless gluons and gluinos ( rather than massive glueballs ) , which lead to @xmath36 .",
    "let us now discuss complete wetting at high temperatures where a phase transition separates the confined phase from a high - temperature deconfined phase .",
    "we assume that this phase transition is first order , such that confined and deconfined phases coexist at @xmath0 . in the case of @xmath85 non - supersymmetric @xmath38 yang - mills theory at high temperatures the universal aspects of the interface dynamics are captured by a 3-d effective action @xcite , @xmath86 = \\int d^3 x \\ [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_i \\phi^ * \\partial_i \\phi + v(\\phi)],\\ ] ] for the polyakov loop @xmath87 , which is a gauge invariant complex scalar field . its expectation value @xmath88 , measures the free energy @xmath89 of a static quark . in the confined phase ,",
    "@xmath89 diverges and @xmath90 vanishes , while in the deconfined phase , @xmath89 is finite and @xmath90 is non - zero . under",
    "topologically non - trivial gauge transformations , which are periodic in euclidean time up to a center element @xmath91 , the polyakov loop changes into @xmath92 .",
    "hence , the @xmath39 symmetry is spontaneously broken in the deconfined phase . under charge conjugation ,",
    "the polyakov loop is replaced by its complex conjugate .",
    "the effective potential @xmath93 is restricted by @xmath39 and charge conjugation symmetry , i.e. @xmath94 in this case , all phases are massive ( note that the deconfined phase has a finite screening length ) , such that the potential is quadratic around all minima .",
    "a simple potential with these properties takes the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "one can restrict oneself to quartic potentials because they are sufficient to explore the universal features of the interface dynamics . at the deconfinement phase transition temperature ( corresponding to @xmath61 ) , the above potential has four degenerate minima at @xmath97 , @xmath78 representing the three deconfined phases and at @xmath98 representing the confined phase . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was shown that a deconfined - deconfined domain wall is completely wet by the confined phase and the corresponding critical exponents have been determined analytically . as expected for short - range forces , one finds @xmath42 , i.e. the width of the complete wetting layer diverges logarithmically .",
    "in addition , for the order parameter at the center of the wetting layer one obtains @xmath99 and @xmath100 .    in @xmath37",
    "supersymmetric @xmath38 yang - mills theory the @xmath72 chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the confined phase . at high temperatures , one expects chiral symmetry to be restored and  as in the non - supersymmetric theory  the @xmath39 center symmetry to be spontaneously broken due to deconfinement .",
    "consequently , the effective action describing the interface dynamics now depends on both order parameters @xmath87 and @xmath49 , such that @xmath101 = \\int d^3 x \\ [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_i \\phi^ * \\partial_i \\phi +   \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_i \\chi^ * \\partial_i \\chi + v(\\phi,\\chi)].\\ ] ] the most general quartic potential consistent with @xmath39 , @xmath72 and charge conjugation now takes the form @xmath102 we assume that deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration occur at the same temperature and that the phase transition is first order .",
    "then three chirally broken confined phases coexist with three distinct chirally symmetric deconfined phases .",
    "the three deconfined phases have @xmath103 , @xmath78 , and @xmath54 , while the three confined phases are characterized by @xmath98 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the phase transition temperature corresponds to a choice of parameters @xmath104 such that all six phases represent degenerate absolute minima of @xmath105 .",
    "again , we look for solutions of the classical equations of motion representing planar domain walls .    figure 5 shows a numerical solution of these equations for a domain wall separating two confined phases with boundary conditions @xmath80 , @xmath106 and @xmath81 , @xmath107 . figure 5a corresponds to a temperature deep in the confined phase .",
    "still , at the domain wall the polyakov loop is non - zero , i.e. the center of the domain wall shows characteristic features of the deconfined phase . as a consequence , close to the wall",
    "the free energy of a static quark is finite and its string can end there .",
    "thus , as discussed in detail in ref.@xcite , wetting provides a field theoretic explanation for why qcd strings can end on domain walls .",
    "this effect was first described by witten in the framework of m - theory @xcite .",
    "figure 5b corresponds to a temperature very close to the phase transition .",
    "then the confined - confined domain wall splits into two confined - deconfined interfaces and the deconfined phase forms a complete wetting layer between them .    for the special values @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 one can find an analytic solution for a confined - deconfined interface . combining two of these solutions to a confined - confined interface ,",
    "one obtains @xmath112 , \\",
    "\\phi_2(z ) = 0 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\chi_1(z)&=&- \\frac{1}{4 } \\chi_0 [ 2 + \\tanh\\alpha(z - z_0 ) - \\tanh\\alpha(z+z_0 ) ] , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the critical temperature corresponds to @xmath115 . near criticality , where @xmath116 is small , the above solution is valid up to order @xmath117 , while now @xmath109 and @xmath110 are satisfied to order @xmath118 .",
    "the width of the deconfined complete wetting layer , @xmath119 grows logarithmically as we approach the phase transition temperature .",
    "this is the expected critical behavior for interfaces with short - range interactions , which have @xmath42 .",
    "we have also checked that @xmath120 , as expected .",
    "again , the order parameter at the center of the wetting layer behaves as @xmath121 complete wetting also occurs on the other side of the phase transition .",
    "then the confined phase completely wets a deconfined - deconfined interface .",
    "the treatment of this case is completely analogous , and the resulting critical exponents are again those for interfaces with short - range interactions .",
    "we expect the same high - temperature interface critical behavior for other values of @xmath5 .",
    "we have investigated universality classes for complete wetting in @xmath37 supersymmetric @xmath1 yang - mills theory . at zero temperature , the coulomb phase may completely wet a confined - confined interface . in that case",
    "the interfaces interact via long - range forces .",
    "the corresponding critical exponents are the same as those for condensed matter systems with retarded van der waals forces with a @xmath35 potential .",
    "one should keep in mind that we have assumed that the coulomb phase indeed exists in supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "should this not to be the case , our calculation , of course , does not apply to this theory . even then",
    ", it still correctly describes the effective theories discussed in this paper . at high temperatures the massive deconfined phase completely wets a confined - confined interface , and the interactions between interfaces are short - ranged .",
    "then the width of the complete wetting layer grows logarithmically as one approaches @xmath0 . above @xmath0 ,",
    "the confined phase can wet a deconfined - deconfined domain wall , with the same critical exponents as before .",
