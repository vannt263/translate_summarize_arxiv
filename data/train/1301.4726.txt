    "there is , by now , convincing evidence for new physics associated with the gravitational interaction on cosmological distance scales @xcite .",
    "it is fashionable to attribute these phenomena to esoteric sources of energy - momentum @xcite , but it is conceivable that gravity itself should be modified by adding terms to the action for general relativity @xcite . very recently , there have been proposals for constructing generalizations of teleparallel gravity @xcite which followed the spirit of modified gravity @xcite as a generalization of general relativity .",
    "the interest in these theories was aroused by the claim that their dynamics differ from those of general relativity but their equations are still second order in derivatives and , therefore , they might be able to account for the accelerated expansion of the universe and remain free of pathologies .",
    "it has been shown , however , that these theories are not locally lorentz invariant @xcite .",
    "gravity is usually considered to be irrelevant as far as the physics of elementary particles is concerned and , in particular , in the context of the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism . for many years only fewer works @xcite have been done in this direction and no work suggests a relation between symmetry breaking and cosmological phenomena .",
    "the aim of this letter is to show that the acceleration of the cosmic expansion can be produced by a symmetry breaking . by adding a perturbation term to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian a new cosmological model is obtained . in this model",
    "the field equation include some symmetry breaking terms which play the role of the so - called  dark energy  and make the cosmic expansion accelerate .",
    "a vacuum de sitter solution is obtained .",
    "the cosmological constant problem , the coincidence problem and the problem of phantom divide line crossing are naturally solved .",
    "the coefficient of the perturbation term is found to be a new cosmological parameter describing the evolution of the universe .",
    "we start from the action @xmath2 where @xmath3 with the bare gravitational constant @xmath4 , @xmath5 with the christoffel symbol @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a new parameter describing the evolution of the universe .",
    "we will see that @xmath7 is very small and then the term @xmath8 can be considered as a perturbation term .",
    "the variational principle yields the field equations for the metric @xmath9 :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the ricci curvature tensor of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the energy - momentum of the matter fields .",
    "these equations can be re - arranged in the einstein - like form @xmath15 the first and the second term on the right are not covariant and represent the  dark  energy - momentum which has the same origin with the energy - momentum of the gravitational field .",
    "we will see that it is this perturbational gravitational energy - momentum that induces the acceleration of the cosmic expansion .",
    "we now investigate the cosmological dynamics for the models of this theory .",
    "we consider a flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker spacetime with the metric @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a scale factor .",
    "for the matter lagrangian @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) we take into account non - relativistic matter and radiation . the non - vanishing components of the christoffel symbol are      and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hubble parameter and a dot represents a derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath23 .",
    "the the field equations ( 4 ) take the forms : @xmath24 and @xmath25 or @xmath26 where        are the density and the pressure of the  dark energy",
    " @xmath8 .",
    "the state equation of the  dark energy ",
    "is then @xmath29 the equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) yield @xmath30 in the vacuum we have a de sitter solution @xmath31 for dust matter @xmath32 the equations ( 8) , ( 9 ) , ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) become @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 the evolution of @xmath38 is illustrated in fig . 1 .",
    "the equations ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , and ( 13 ) indicate that the property of the  dark energy  depends on the pressure @xmath39 of the ordinary matter . in dust matter or vacuum",
    ", however , the property of the  dark energy  depends only on the spacetime geometry as indicated by the equations ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , and ( 20 ) .    letting @xmath40 and @xmath41 one can compute @xmath42 then letting @xmath43 we obtain @xmath44 observations of type ia supernovae at moderately large redshifts ( @xmath45 to @xmath46 )",
    "have led to the conclusion that the hubble expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "this is consistent also with microwave background measurements @xcite .",
    "according to the result of @xcite , @xmath47 corresponds to @xmath48 which is consistent with the observations .    using the formula",
    "@xmath49 we have @xmath50 then the equation ( 17 ) leads to @xmath51 and can be integrated @xmath52 the function @xmath53 is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 which is roughly consistent with the observations @xcite .",
    "the equation ( 8) indicates that during the evolution of the universe @xmath54 decreases owing to decreasing of the matter density @xmath55 .",
    "this makes @xmath38 descend during the evolution of the universe .",
    "the evolution of the function @xmath56 given by ( 20 ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . according to ( 20 ) when @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xmath59 , @xmath8 changes from  visible  to dark as indicated by ( 10 ) .",
    "if @xmath60 , it decelerates the expansion , if @xmath61 , it accelerates the expansion .",
    "when @xmath62 , @xmath38 crosses the phantom divide line @xmath63 .",
    "in other words , the expansion of the universe naturally includes a decelerating and an accelerating phase .",
    "@xmath7 given by ( 21 ) can be seen as a new constant describing the evolution of the universe .",
