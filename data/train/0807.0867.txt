    "susy breaking at meta - stable vacua in various sqcd models has been intensively studied since the proposal of the iss model @xcite .",
    "the other interest is meta - stable susy breaking in perturbed seiberg - witten theories @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we focus on this possibility .",
    "we consider four - dimensional @xmath0 @xmath1 , @xmath2 flavors sqcd with fi term .",
    "supersymmetry in the model is partially broken down to @xmath3 due to the presence of adjoint mass terms .",
    "the extra @xmath4 part is necessary for the fi term and treated as cut - off theory with landau pole @xmath5 . with the help of the seiberg - witten solution",
    ", we can analyze the theory in exact way provided the landau pole is very far away and the perturbation terms are very much smaller than the @xmath6 dynamical scale @xmath7 . in the following ,",
    "we focus on @xmath8 case and show that there are susy breaking meta - stable minima in the full quantum level .",

    "the chiral superfields @xmath18 and @xmath19 are hypermultiplets that are in the fundamental and anti - fundamental representations of the @xmath17 gauge group ( @xmath20 is the flavor index , and @xmath21 is the @xmath17 color index ) .",
    "@xmath22 is the @xmath3 superfield strength and @xmath23 are complex gauge couplings .",
    "the second term @xmath24 is the soft susy breaking term given by @xmath25 in @xmath24 , @xmath26 are masses corresponding to @xmath4 and @xmath17 part of the adjoint scalars and @xmath27 is the fi parameter . in the absence of @xmath24 ,",
    "the gauge symmetry is broken as @xmath28 on the coulomb branch @xmath29 where @xmath30 are hypermultiplet scalars .",
    "once we turn on @xmath24 , there are susy vacua on the coulomb and higgs branches .",
    "we are going to investigate the quantum effective action on the coulomb branch .",
    "the exact low energy effective lagrangian is described by light fields , the @xmath17 dynamical scale @xmath7 , the landau pole @xmath5 , the masses @xmath31 and the fi parameter @xmath27 .",
    "if the perturbation terms are much smaller than the dynamical scale @xmath7 , the effective lagrangian @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 here the first term @xmath34 describes an @xmath35 susy lagrangian containing full quantum corrections .",

    "the effective lagrangian for these vector multiplets is @xmath42 , \\label{vm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a prepotential as will be discussed below .",
    "the effective gauge coupling @xmath23 is defined by @xmath44 with moduli @xmath45 .",

    "these hypermultiplets correspond to the light bps dyons , monopoles and quarks . which are specified through the appropriate quantum numbers @xmath49 .",
    "here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the electric and magnetic charges of @xmath41 , respectively , whereas @xmath52 is the @xmath4 charge .",
    "the potential is a function of @xmath53 .",
    "we found stationary points along @xmath54 directions at ( 1 ) @xmath55 and ( 2 ) @xmath56 .",
    "the potential value at each stationary points are evaluated as @xmath57 where @xmath58 are functions of @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the stationary point ( [ potential2 ] ) where the light hypermultiplet acquires a vacuum expectation value by the condensation of the bps states is energetically favored because @xmath61 .    due to the abovementioned reason , we focus on the singularity points in the moduli space . to find the explicit potential ,",
    "we need the moduli space metric , and hence the prepotential .",
    "the monodromy transformation around the singular points in the moduli space dictates us that the @xmath4 modulus @xmath62 can be interpreted as the common hypermultiplet mass @xmath63 in the @xmath17 gauge theory .",
    "this fact implies that the prepotential in our model is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the prepotential for @xmath17 massive sqcd with common mass @xmath66 .",
    "the constant @xmath67 is a free parameter which is used to fix the landau pole @xmath5 to the appropriate value which implies @xmath68 . ] .",
    "the singular points on the moduli space are determined by a cubic polynomial @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the cubic polynomial give the positions of the singular points in the @xmath69-plane . in the case",
    "@xmath70 with a common hypermultiplet mass @xmath63 , which is regarded as the modulus @xmath71 here , the solution is obtained as @xmath72 the singular points correspond to dyons , a monopole and a quark .",
    "the behavior of the singularity flow along @xmath62 direction can be found in @xcite . at the singular points in the moduli space , @xmath73 and @xmath62",
    "are related to each other and the potential is a function of @xmath62 only . to find the stationary points of the potential along the @xmath62 direction is a difficult task and we need the help of numerical analysis .        as a result",
    ", we found the global susy minima at @xmath78 in the degenerated dyon and monopole singular points .",
    "next , let us turn on @xmath79 and @xmath27 . in the presence of the soft term ,",
    "the gauge dynamics favors the monopole and the dyon points at @xmath80 as susy vacua besides the runaway vacua .",
    "it implies that if we add @xmath81 terms which produce a vacuum at a point different from @xmath80 at the classical level , susy is dynamically broken as a consequence of the discrepancy of susy conditions between the classical and the quantum theories . actually , turning on the mass @xmath79 and the fi parameter @xmath27 realizes such a situation . in this case",
    ", the classical vacuum is at @xmath82 , different from the point @xmath80 which the dynamics favors .",
    "a resultant susy breaking vacuum is realized at non - zero value of @xmath62 .",
    "this is very similar to the susy breaking mechanism discussed in the izawa - yanagida - intriligator - thomas model in @xmath83 susy gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we show a schematic picture of our situation in fig .",
    "[ iyit ] .",
    "let us see in detail how this works for non - zero values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "[ monopole_minimum ] shows the evolution of the potential energies at the monopole point @xmath86 for several values of @xmath27 as a function of @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "the potential minimum is no longer realized at @xmath80 , but the location is shifted to negative values of @xmath87 as is expected from the discussion in the previous paragraph .",
    "furthermore , the potential energy has a non - zero value and therefore susy is dynamically broken .",
    "we find that the potential energies at the left and right dyon singular points also have the same structure .",
    "a qualitative picture of the evolutions of the potential minima is depicted in fig .",
    "[ 3d - plot ] .",
    "in addition to these local minima , there are supersymmetric vacua on the higgs branch which survive from the quantum corrections .",
    "we estimated the decay rate from our local minima to the susy vacua on the higgs branch and found that the decay rate can be taken to be very small .",
    "this means our local minima are nothing but meta - stable susy breaking vacua .",
