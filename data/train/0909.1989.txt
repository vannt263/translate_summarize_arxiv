    "previous work has established the strong well - posedness of the initial - boundary value problem ( ibvp ) for einstein s equations expressed as a hyperbolic system in harmonic coordinates .",
    "the result was first obtained using pseudo - differential theory , i.e. using a fourier - laplace expansion , which established well - posedness in the generalized sense  @xcite .",
    "the result was subsequently obtained using standard energy estimates  @xcite .",
    "this places the ibvp on the same analytic footing as the cauchy problem , whose well - posedness was also established using harmonic coordinates in the classic work of choquet - bruhat  @xcite .",
    "the geometric formulation of the boundary conditions and boundary data for the ibvp is more complicated than for the cauchy problem .",
    "recently , this boundary data was presented in a 4-dimensional geometric form  @xcite . here",
    "we recast the boundary data as 3-dimensional tensor fields intrinsic to the boundary , analogous to the presentation of cauchy data in terms of the 3-metric and extrinsic curvature of the initial cauchy hypersurface .",
    "the spacetime metric which solves the harmonic ibvp with this data is uniquely determined up to a diffeomorphism .    in the cauchy problem ,",

    "data on a timelike boundary @xmath3 which meets @xmath2 in a surface @xmath4 are used to further extend the solution to the domain of dependence @xmath5 . in practical applications",
    "@xmath4 is topologically a sphere surrounding some system of interest but here we only consider the local problem in a neighborhood of a point of intersection between the cauchy hypersurface and the boundary . for hyperbolic systems , the global solution in the spacetime manifold @xmath6 can be obtained by patching together local solutions .",
    "the setting for this local problem is depicted in fig .",

    "fig : bound ]    there are no natural boundaries for the gravitational field analogous to the conducting boundaries that play a major role in electromagnetism .",
    "consequently , the ibvp for einstein s equations only received widespread attention after its importance to the artificial outer boundaries used in numerical relativity was pointed out  @xcite .",
    "the first well - posed ibvp was achieved for a tetrad formulation of einstein s theory in terms of a first differential order system which included the tetrad , the connection and the curvature tensor as evolution fields  @xcite .",
    "a strongly well - posed ibvp was later established for the harmonic formulation of einstein s equations as a system of second order quasilinear wave equations for the metric  @xcite .",
    "strong well - posedness guarantees the existence of a unique solution which depends continuously on both the cauchy data and the boundary data .",
    "the results were further generalized in  @xcite to apply to general quasilinear symmetric hyperbolic systems whose boundary conditions have a certain hierarchical form .",
    "the initial data for the cauchy problem can be formulated in terms of two symmetric tensor fields @xmath8 ( a euclidean 3-metric ) and @xmath9 on a 3-manifold @xmath10 subject to the ( hamiltonian and momentum ) constraints @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the covariant derivative and @xmath14 is the curvature scalar associated with @xmath15 . as characterized in  @xcite , via an embedding in a 4-dimensional manifold @xmath6 , the data @xmath8 and @xmath9 on the _ disembodied _",

    "here we present an analogous result for the ibvp .",
    "the difficulties underlying the ibvp , which have most recently been discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite , make the formulation of disembodied boundary data more difficult than for the cauchy problem .",
    "there are three main complications .",
    "* the first complication stems from a well - known property of the ibvp for the flat - space scalar wave equation @xmath19 in the region @xmath20 .",
    "although the initial cauchy data consist of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , only half as much boundary data can be freely prescribed at @xmath23 , e.g the dirichlet data @xmath24 , or the neumann data @xmath25 or the sommerfeld data @xmath26 ( based upon the derivative in the outgoing characteristic direction ) . for a given physical problem , this implies that the boundary data can not be prescribed before the boundary condition is specified , i.e. the correct boundary data depend upon the boundary condition , unlike the situation for the cauchy problem .",
    "the analogue in the gravitational case is the inability to prescribe both the metric and its normal derivative on a timelike boundary , which implies that you can not freely prescribe both the intrinsic metric of the boundary and its extrinsic curvature .",
    "this leads to a further complication regarding constraint enforcement on the boundary , i.e. the hamiltonian and momentum constraints ( [ eq : ham ] ) and ( [ eq : mom ] ) can not be enforced directly because they couple the metric and its normal derivative .",
    "here we restrict our attention to sommerfeld boundary data which we prescribe in a constraint free manner . *",
    "a sommerfeld boundary condition for a metric component supplies the value of the derivative @xmath27 in an outgoing null direction @xmath28 .",
    "such boundary conditions are very beneficial for numerical work since they allow discretization error to propagate across the boundary ( whereas dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions reflect the error and trap it in the numerical grid )",
    ". however , the boundary does not pick out a unique outgoing null direction at a given point ( but , instead , essentially a half null cone ) .",
    "this complicates the geometric formulation of a sommerfeld boundary condition .",
    "in addition , constraint preservation does not allow specification of sommerfeld data for all components of the metric , as will be seen in formulating the sommerfeld conditions ( [ eq : hk ] ) - ( [ eq : hl ] ) . *",
    "the third major complication arises from gauge freedom . in the evolution of the cauchy data it is necessary to introduce a foliation of the spacetime by cauchy hypersurfaces @xmath29 , with unit timelike normal @xmath30 .",
    "the evolution of the spacetime metric @xmath31 is carried out along the flow of an evolution vector field @xmath32 related to the normal by the lapse @xmath33 and shift @xmath34 according to @xmath35 the choice of foliation is part of the gauge freedom in the resulting solution but does not enter into the specification of the initial data . in the ibvp ,",
    "the foliation is unavoidably coupled with the formulation of the boundary condition .",
    "thus some gauge information must be incorporated in the formulation of the boundary condition and boundary data .    in order to resolve these complications",

    "the 3-dimensional description of the data in terms of scalar , vector and tensor fields intrinsic to the boundary is quite abstract at this stage .",
    "their physical significance only becomes clear in section  [ sec : exist ] , where the proof of the theorem is given .",
    "the proof is based upon the well - posedness of the 4-dimensional geometrical formulation of the harmonic ibvp given in  @xcite",
    ". constraint preservation is established by incorporating the harmonic conditions into the boundary conditions .",
    "the motivation for this work stems from the need for an improved understanding and implementation of boundary conditions in the computational codes being used to simulate binary black holes .",
    "we discuss the applicability of our results to numerical relativity in sec .",

    "we have thus shown that the resulting vacuum spacetimes are diffeomorphic _ if _ the disembodied boundary data and initial cauchy data are diffeomorphic .",
    "this comprises a version of geometric uniqueness , which has been pointed out as a missing ingredient in prior formulations of the ibvp  @xcite .",
    "however , the result is not as strong as for the pure cauchy problem for which the converse is also true : the resulting vacuum spacetimes are diffeomorphic _ only if _ the initial data are diffeomorphic .",
    "the converse is more complicated for the ibvp and does not hold in the disembodied setting because the data @xmath159 are superfluous .",
    "it is only the trace - free part of the embedded data @xmath160 which enters the shear @xmath161 .",
    "but there is no way to pick out the trace free part without knowledge of the metric , which is an unknown at the stage of specifying data .",
    "( for linear perturbations , a background metric could be used but this construction does not extend to the nonlinear case . ) this is perhaps an unavoidable feature of disembodied sommerfeld data for the ibvp .    as a result , disembodied boundary data which are not related by a diffeomorphism can lead to isometric spacetimes .",
    "however , it follows by direct geometrical construction that an isometry class of spacetimes does uniquely determine the embedded boundary data @xmath56 and @xmath161 up to a diffeomorphism .",

    "modification of this transport law would lead to a different background and the spacetime generated by the same disembodied data would in general not be diffeomorphic .",
    "this is similar to the scalar wave problem , for which the same boundary data would lead to different solutions if , say , a dirichlet boundary condition were used instead of a sommerfeld condition . in the present case",
    ", a new background metric implies a different form of the sommerfeld condition and , for fixed boundary data , the resulting spacetime will ( in general ) not be isometric to the original spacetime .",
    "the effect of the boundary data is changed by the difference between the two background connections .",
    "the motivation for this work has been the treatment of the outer boundary in the numerical simulation of the inspiral and merger of binary black holes .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ eq : ak ] ) - ( [ eq : hl ] ) , which lead to a strongly well - posed ibvp , can be applied directly to any of the harmonic evolution codes which have been used to simulate this binary problem  @xcite . at present ,",
    "none of these harmonic codes incorporate boundary conditions that ensure strong well - posedness .",
    "the closest example is the pseudo - spectral harmonic code described in  @xcite which incorporates a second differential order boundary condition which freezes the @xmath162 weyl component and was shown to be well - posed in the generalized sense in the high frequency limit  @xcite .",
    "an important attribute of strong well - posedness is the estimate of the boundary values of the solution and its derivatives which are provided by an energy conservation law obeyed by the principle part of the equations .",
    "this boundary stability extends to the semi - discrete system of ordinary differential equations in time which are obtained by replacing spatial derivatives by finite differences obeying summation by parts ( the discrete counterpart of integration by parts ) , so that energy conservation caries over to the semi - discrete problem .",
    "this stability then extends to the numerical evolution algorithm obtained by applying an appropriate time integrator , such as runge - kutta .",
    "the advantage of boundary stability in numerical applications is that the smoothness of the solution is unaffected by reflections off the boundary .",
    "this avoids the long timescale instabilities which might otherwise arise from multiple reflections . for the harmonic einstein problem",
    ", each component of the metric obeys a quasilinear wave equation so that it is straightforward to develop a summation by parts algorithm based upon the standard energy expression for a scalar wave in a curved spacetime  @xcite .",
    "a code incorporating such an algorithm was applied , using a version of the well - posed sommerfeld boundary conditions presented here , to the test problem of a highly nonlinear gauge wave propagating inside a cubic boundary  @xcite .",
    "although the proof of strong well - posedness given in  @xcite was based upon a scalar wave energy differing by a small boost from the standard energy expression , the successful results for this test problem confirm the robustness of the underlying approach .",
    "strong well - posedness extends to more general quasi - harmonic formulations for which the reduced einstein equations have the form @xmath163 where @xmath164 are the generalized harmonic constraints ( [ eq : genharm ] ) and the coefficients @xmath165 have the dependence @xmath166 .",
    "( this includes constraint modified versions of the harmonic system . )",
    "constraint preservation follows from the bianchi identity @xmath167 which implies a homogeneous wave equation for @xmath168 , @xmath169 if the boundary conditions enforce @xmath170 and the initial data enforces @xmath171 then the unique solution of ( [ eq : bianchi ] ) is @xmath138 . as a result , the sommerfeld boundary conditions in the geometrical form ( [ eq : ak ] ) - ( [ eq : sigqq ] ) , along with ( [ eq : hk ] ) - ( [ eq : hl ] ) which enforce @xmath170 , lead to a well - posed harmonic ibvp in which the harmonic constraints @xmath138 are satisfied everywhere . in turn ,",
    "( [ eq : creduced ] ) implies that the hamiltonian and momentum constraints @xmath172 are also satisfied .",
    "beyond the geometrical aspects of the harmonic ibvp , there are practical concerns that arise in astrophysical applications .",
    "the linear time dependence of the background metric ( [ eq : g0 ] ) could lead to deleterious long time scale effects in numerical simulations .",
    "for that reason , it is preferable to modify the prescription ( [ eq : gt0 ] ) for the background metric so that ( [ eq : g0 ] ) changes to @xmath173 and the time dependence damps on a time scale determined by @xmath174 .",
    "alternatively , the purpose of tying the background metric to the initial cauchy data was to make clear that it did not affect the geometric uniqueness of the solution .",
    "otherwise , the minkowski metric in the coordinates adapted to the evolution could have been chosen as the background metric .",
    "this would leave intact the well - posedness of the ibvp and might be the most expedient approach in some numerical applications , although ( [ eq : gm0 ] ) has the advantage of suppressing nonlinear effects in the early stage of an evolution .",
    "another practical concern is that the proper boundary data @xmath56 and @xmath59 are not normally known in an astrophysical application .",
    "the practice in simulating an isolated system is to assume homogeneous data on the artificial outer boundary , i.e. @xmath175 .",
    "such homogeneous data in general leads to some spurious back reflection from the boundary .",
    "however , as discussed in  @xcite for the harmonic ibvp , similar boundary conditions on a round spherical outer boundary of large surface area radius @xmath176 lead to reflected waves whose amplitude falls off asymptotically as @xmath177 for both quadrupole gauge waves and quadrupole gravitational waves .",
    "( the calculation assumes that the linearized approximation is applicable .",
    "modifications of the boundary conditions by lower differential order terms involving factors of @xmath176 lead to a faster @xmath178 falloff for the reflected quadrupole gravitational waves .",
    "@xcite )    the boundary conditions ( [ eq : ak ] ) - ( [ eq : hl ] ) are slightly different than those considered in  @xcite and , in particular , the homogeneous boundary condition @xmath179 leads to reflected waves with only a @xmath180 falloff , as previously noted in  @xcite .",
    "however , improved performance can be obtained by taking advantage of the sensitivity of the boundary conditions to the location of the indices .",
    "if ( [ eq : shdata ] ) and ( [ eq : sigqq ] ) are replaced by @xmath181 then agreement with the corresponding boundary condition ( 94 ) of  @xcite is obtained . in that case , for the boundary conditions ( [ eq : ak ] ) - ( [ eq : al ] ) and ( [ eq : nshdata ] ) , along with the harmonic constraints ( [ eq : hk ] ) - ( [ eq : hl ] ) , the amplitudes of the reflected quadrupole gauge waves and quadrupole gravitational waves again fall off asymptotically as @xmath177 .",
    "thus the application of these sommerfeld boundary conditions with homogeneous data results in small back reflection from the boundary of an isolated system .",
    "while the sommerfeld boundary conditions considered here were developed for the harmonic ibvp , their geometric nature allows them to be formally applied to any metric version of the reduced einstein equations , in particular the alternative `` @xmath182 '' formulations upon which much numerical work has been based .",
    "however , in that case , well - posedness and constraint preservation do not necessarily follow .",
    "one approach to dealing with these issues would be to re - express the @xmath182 formulations in terms of the covariant 4-dimensional @xmath183 theory  @xcite , in which the reduced evolution equations take the form ( [ eq : creduced ] ) but with the harmonic constraints @xmath168 replaced by a more general vector field @xmath184 , which can be used to change the principle part of the resulting evolution system .",
    "the @xmath183 formalism has been shown to encompass the standard @xmath182 formulations , including the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm )  @xcite , the kidder - scheel - teukolsky  @xcite , the nagy - ortiz - reula  @xcite and the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn )  @xcite formulations .",
    "it is possible that the close analogue between the @xmath183 and harmonic formulations might be used to shed light on the analytic properties of @xmath182 systems .",
    "however , such an investigation of the well - posedenss of the @xmath182 ibvp is stymied by the fact that none of the systems used in numerical applications have been shown to be symmetric hyperbolic .",
    "some @xmath182 systems have been show to be strongly hyperbolic , which ensures a well - posed cauchy problem , but symmetric hyperbolicity is required to apply the standard theorems for a well - posed ibvp . for that reason , the discussion here",
    "is restricted to how the sommerfeld boundary conditions developed here might be applied in a manner consistent with what is presently known about @xmath182 formulations .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ eq : ak ] ) - ( [ eq : sigqq ] ) can be translated in a straightforward way into a `` 3 + 1 '' decomposition @xmath185 , in which the metric takes the form ( [ eq : gdecom ] ) where , in terms of the lapse and shift ( [ eq : lapshif ] ) , @xmath186 although there is a different decomposition ( [ eq : bdecom ] ) intrinsic to the boundary , the outgoing null direction used in formulating a sommerfeld condition is intrinsic to both decompositions .",
    "let @xmath187 be the unit normal to the boundary foliation @xmath36 , which lies in the @xmath188 cauchy hypersurface , so that the metric ( [ eq : gdecom ] ) has the further decomposition @xmath189 where again @xmath190 is the 2-metric intrinsic to the foliation @xmath36 of the boundary .",
    "then the outgoing null vector @xmath191 normal to the foliation has components @xmath192 where @xmath64 is the hyperbolic angle arising from the velocity of the boundary relative to the cauchy hypersurfaces . in terms of the lapse and normal component of the shift , @xmath193 where @xmath194 for a boundary which is moving inward with respect to the cauchy hypersurfaces .",
    "the sign of @xmath195 determines whether the advective derivative @xmath196 is outward ( @xmath194 ) or inward ( @xmath197 ) at the boundary and , as a result , can affect the number of required boundary conditions .",
    "the sommerfeld derivative takes the simple 3 + 1 form @xmath198 where @xmath196 is the part containing the time derivative @xmath199 .",
    "thus the sommerfeld boundary conditions ( [ eq : ak ] ) - ( [ eq : sigqq ] ) can be used to supply boundary values for the time derivatives of 6 metric components , or equivalently to supply boundary values for 5 components of the extrinsic curvature @xmath200 of the cauchy foliation and for the time derivative of one metric component .",
    "in particular , ( [ eq : ak ] ) - ( [ eq : aq ] ) and ( [ eq : sigqq ] ) supply boundary values for @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 and ( [ eq : al ] ) supplies the boundary value for the time derivative of the normal component of the shift @xmath204 , i.e. @xmath205 for a boundary aligned with the @xmath206-coordinate .    the remaining sommerfeld boundary conditions ( [ eq : hk ] ) - ( [ eq : hl ] ) , which enforce the harmonic constraints , require modification depending upon the particular @xmath182 formulation and gauge conditions . only 6 components of einstein s equations are used in a @xmath182 evolution , with the gauge conditions determining the evolution of the lapse and shift . as a first example , consider the adm formulation in which the 6 einstein equations @xmath207 are evolved .",
    "the evolution of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints @xmath208 and @xmath209 is governed by the contracted bianchi identity @xmath210 , which gives rise to the symmetric hyperbolic constraint propagation system @xmath211 where the coefficients @xmath212 and @xmath213 arise from christoffel symbols and do not enter the principle part .",
    "an analysis of this system shows that only one boundary condition is allowed provided @xmath214 , i.e provided the boundary is moving _ inward _ relative to the cauchy hypersurfaces .",
    "the theory of symmetric hyperbolic systems then guarantees that all the constraints will be preserved if @xmath215 is satisfied at the boundary .",
    "( additional boundary conditions are necessary for constraint preservation if @xmath216 . ) by combining the evolution system ( [ eq : admev ] ) with ( [ eq : admcon ] )",
    ", this boundary condition is equivalent to @xmath217 i.e. the raychaudhuri equation  ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the expansion of the outgoing null rays tangent to @xmath191 . thus , for the adm system",
    ", constraint preservation can be enforced by the sommerfeld boundary condition ( [ eq : drho ] ) for @xmath220 , which supplies the boundary values for the remaining component @xmath221 of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "unfortunately , although the subsidiary constraint system is symmetric hyperbolic , the adm evolution system is only weakly hyperbolic and consequently leads to unstable evolution .    in terms of astrophysical applications ,",
    "the most important @xmath182 formulation is the bssn system , which has been used by the majority of groups  @xcite carrying out binary black hole and neutron star simulations .",
    "the development of the bssn formulation has proceeded through an interplay between educated guesses and feedback from code performance . only in hindsight",
    "has its success spurred mathematical analysis , which has shown that certain versions are strongly hyperbolic and thus have a well - posed cauchy problem  @xcite .",
    "although significant progress has been made in establishing some of the necessary conditions for well - posedness and constraint preservation of the ibvp  @xcite , there is still no satisfactory mathematical theory on which to base numerical work . in current numerical practice ,",
    "the boundary conditions for bssn evolution systems are applied in a naive , homogeneous sommerfeld form to each evolution variable ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the geometric nature of the sommerfeld boundary conditions ( [ eq : ak ] ) - ( [ eq : sigqq ] ) and their role in a well - posed harmonic ibvp suggest that they might lead to improved performance over the present boundary treatment of the bssn system .",
    "however , there are two complications .",
    "the first involves the sign of the normal component of the shift @xmath222 at the boundary , which also entered the above discussion of the adm constraint system .",
    "a recent analysis  @xcite of the bssn evolution system shows that the number of incoming fields at the boundary , and therefore the number of required boundary conditions , depends upon the sign of @xmath223 . a practical scheme for dealing with this would require the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath224 ( or some similar dirichlet condition to control the sign ) rather than the sommerfeld condition ( [ eq : al ] ) for the normal component of the shift .",
    "the other complication for the bssn system involves constraint preservation .",
    "the bssn evolution system enforces the 6 einstein equations @xmath225 for which the constraint system implied by the bianchi identity takes the form @xmath226 this is no longer symmetric hyperbolic and would not lead to stable constraint preservation even for the cauchy problem . in order to remedy this ,",
    "the bssn evolution system modifies ( [ eq : bssnmev ] ) by mixing in a set of auxiliary constraints , which combine with the constraint system ( [ eq : bssnmc ] ) to form a larger symmetric hyperbolic constraint system . the freedom in the constraint - mixing parameters and gauge conditions",
    "complicates a general treatment . here",
    "the discussion will be limited to a particular choice  @xcite for which the linearization off minkowski space leads to a symmetric hyperbolic system with a well - posed ibvp for the case of a dirichlet boundary condition @xmath224 on the normal component of the shift .",
    "although the nonlinear evolution system is no longer symmetric hyperbolic , the boundary conditions for the linearized theory can be formally applied and lead to a symmetric hyperbolic constraint system .",
    "constraint preservation then follows for the parameter range @xmath227 in the boundary conditions given in equation ( 97 ) of  @xcite .",
    "the particular choice @xmath228 , leads to the boundary condition  @xcite @xmath229 where @xmath230 represents contributions from the auxiliary constraints , or , by using the evolution system ( [ eq : bssnmev ] ) , @xmath231 it is a bizarre feature of the @xmath182 problem that the constraint preserving boundary conditions switch from the outgoing raychaudhuri form ( [ eq : raych ] ) to the ingoing raychaudhuri form ( [ eq : inraych ] ) in going from the adm to the bssn system .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation for the outgoing null direction can not be imposed in the allowed range of @xmath232 . nevertheless , ( [ eq : inraych ] ) can still be used to supply boundary values for the remaining @xmath221 component of extrinsic curvature .",
    "it appears from the above discussion that the formal application of the sommerfeld boundary conditions to the bssn system must be restricted to ( [ eq : ak ] ) , ( [ eq : aq ] ) and ( [ eq : sigqq ] ) which supply boundary values for 5 components of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "boundary values for the remaining @xmath221 component must be obtained in accord with constraint preservation , e.g. from ( [ eq : inraych ] ) or some variant depending upon the particular formulation .",
    "the normal component of the shift requires a dirichlet boundary condition that determines its sign , e.g. @xmath233 .",
    "appropriate boundary conditions for the lapse and tangential components of the shift depend upon the specific gauge conditions ( see  @xcite for an example ) . in the spirit of the bssn formalism , computational experiments would be necessary to determine whether ( [ eq : ak ] ) , ( [ eq : aq ] ) and ( [ eq : sigqq ] ) lead to improved performance .",
    "we have shown that a geometrically unique spacetime can be locally constructed from sommerfeld data determined by the fields @xmath234 on a disembodied boundary @xmath61 , along with the initial data prescribed on @xmath235 .",
    "the boundary data specify a foliation @xmath57 of @xmath61 but involve no metric or other geometric properties of the boundary . after the embedding of @xmath236 as the boundary @xmath237 of a 4-manifold @xmath6 , the induced fields @xmath238 supply the necessary boundary data for an isometry class of spacetime metrics which satisfy einstein s equations . under diffeomorphisms of the disembodied boundary @xmath61 and cauchy hypersurface @xmath16 , the mapped data determine diffeomorphic vacuum spacetimes .",
    "the gauge in which a particular metric @xmath62 is constructed via a solution of the harmonic ibvp depends upon the choice of evolution field @xmath32 , which also determines an associated background metric @xmath103 by lie transport of the initial data .",
    "together @xmath62 and @xmath103 supply the geometric interpretation of the boundary data in terms of the outgoing null vector @xmath117 normal to the foliation @xmath36 of the boundary .",
    "the field @xmath56 , constructed from @xmath66 and @xmath67 via ( [ eq : qa ] ) , is the geodesic curvature of @xmath117 , relative to its geodesic curvature computed with the background metric .",
    "the field @xmath161 ( or equivalently @xmath59 ) computed from @xmath68 via ( [ eq : shtendata ] ) ( or ( [ eq : shdata ] ) ) is the shear of @xmath117 , relative to its background value .",
    "the resulting metric is harmonic with respect to the background metric , according to @xmath130 ( see ( [ eq : charm ] ) ) .",
    "all possible choices of @xmath32 are related by diffeomorphism , so that all possible gauges are included .",
    "the sommerfeld boundary conditions have direct application to harmonic evolution codes used in simulating binary black holes , where they would provide a numerical algorithm based upon a strongly well - posed ibvp .",
    "furthermore , for harmonic evolution , homogeneous sommerfeld data gives rise to asymptotically small back reflection of quadrupole waves from an asymptotically large spherical outer boundary of an isolated system .",
    "the geometric nature of the 6 boundary conditions ( [ eq : ak ] ) - ( [ eq : sigqq ] ) suggests that they might also be applicable to codes based upon a @xmath182 formulation , e.g. the bssn system , as a way to reduce spurious boundary effects generated by the naive sommerfeld conditions now in practice .",
    "there are two caveats .",
    "first , strong well - posedness of the ibvp does not directly apply to any present @xmath182 system .",
    "second , the additional sommerfeld boundary conditions ( [ eq : hk ] ) - ( [ eq : hl ] ) only guarantee preservation of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints for harmonic ( or quasi - harmonic ) formulations and would have to be replaced in accord with constraint preservation . in the case of the particular bssn formulation shown in  @xcite to posses a well - posed ibvp in the linearized approximation , there are further complications . instead of the sommerfeld condition ( [ eq : al ] ) , a dirichlet boundary condition is required to control the sign of the normal component of the shift .",
    "the 5 other sommerfeld conditions ( [ eq : ak ] ) , ( [ eq : aq ] ) and ( [ eq : sigqq ] ) can be used to supply boundary values for 5 components of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "in addition , the boundary values of the remaining component of extrinsic curvature can be supplied by a constraint preserving boundary condition , but there is no apparent way to do this in a sommerfeld form .",
    "these complications would , at the least , lead to more spurious reflection from the boundary than for a harmonic code .",
    "the results of this paper can perhaps guide further experimentation and investigation towards a modification of the bssn system that adds to its successful features .",
