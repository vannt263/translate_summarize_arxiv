    "further , we are free to consider other scaling behaviors in the strongly coupled sector , such as @xmath2 and lifshitz spacetimes .",
    "there is no advantage to generating the fermi sea in the bulk of a larger holographic theory .",
    "( in particular , any desire to obtain the @xmath18 fields from an explicit uv brane should be resisted . )",
    "since these fermions are gauge singlets , the geometry does no work for us in summing their quantum effects ; if these effects are important we must deal with them ourselves .",
    "further , obtaining both sectors holographically is complicated and constraining .",
    "these complications may be essential in determining the low energy physics of a given theory ( if a holographic description holds above the scale of the fermi momentum ) , but to classify all possible low energy physics within a given universality class the semi - holographic description is more efficient .    as one example of the flexibility of the semi - holographic construction",

    "the correlator @xmath45 implies @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "since the fermi momentum @xmath15 is a uv scale we are interested in @xmath48 and so we expand , @xmath49 using this in the correlator  ( [ gcorr ] ) , the leading @xmath33-independent term should be absorbed into the definiton of @xmath7 from the uv theory .",
    "the leading correction to the fermion self - energy is @xmath50 as in fermi liquid theory , but here it is real because the kinematics forbids the quasiparticle decay .",
    "this example should capture the low energy dynamics of the models considered in @xcite where a fermion lives in a zero temperature holographic superconducting background and the ir part of the geometry was an emergent @xmath2 solution .    similarly , we can extend to a lifshitz theory with dynamical exponent @xmath51 . for an operator of energy dimension @xmath43 , @xmath52 this asymptotic expansion in @xmath50 is seen , for example , in the holographic calculation of the correlator  @xcite , obtained by solving the differential equation @xmath53 here we have for simplicity taken a scalar correlator to illustrate the scaling , in the metric @xmath54 and we have defined @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "at @xmath57 , the @xmath58 term is dominant at the horizon , giving the normalizable solution @xmath59 .",
    "perturbation theory in @xmath50 is nonsingular order by order because this solution falls off rapidly at large @xmath60 , so again the leading correction scales as in fermi liquid theory , but with a real coefficient .",
    "the fermionic correlator will have similar scaling properties .",
    "thus , the non - fermi liquid behavior found in refs .",
    "@xcite is only present for the @xmath3 ir theory , in which the momentum does not scale .",
    "the fermionic correlator would have interesting properties when @xmath61 and @xmath33 are both small , but this does not affect the fermi surface behavior . also , when there is bulk fermi sea as in fig .",
    "[ fig : domain]b , the dimension @xmath43 becomes complex , but again this is seen only when @xmath61 and @xmath33 become small together .",
    "let us discuss a few more aspects of the lifshitz case . for finite values of @xmath33 ,",
    "the @xmath50 term dominates at the horizon and the boundary conditions are changed to @xmath62 .",
    "the quasiparticle width is a tunneling effect and can be estimated using the wkb approximation , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath8 is a uv cutoff . at small frequency",
    "the barrier is large , and we can approximate @xmath65 . we can neglect the @xmath66 terms and send the uv cutoff to infinity to find , @xmath67 the imaginary part goes to zero exponentially at low frequency .",
    "it is interesting to examine the crossover from lifshitz to @xmath0 behavior as @xmath51 becomes large ( @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath68 ) .",
    "to do this we expand around the answer for @xmath69 , which can also be read off from the wkb approximation : @xmath70 where @xmath71 . for large @xmath51",
    "the turning point is @xmath72 .",
    "we can expand the integrand in @xmath51 as long as the @xmath73 term is subdominant over the domain of the integral .",
    "this is the case for @xmath74 such that now the quasi particle width behaves as , @xmath75 we have recovered the @xmath0 scaling with log corrections and scaling dimension @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath77 s will be small for @xmath78 .",
    "for energy scales @xmath79 the answer will then cross over to ( [ lifscale ] ) .",
    "thus for modestly large values of @xmath51 the strange metal behavior extends down to very low energies with small logarithmic corrections .",
    "the lifshitz case studied above should apply to the low energy dynamics of fermions introduced into various known gravity backgrounds with lifshitz as the ir fixed point .",
    "examples are the charged dilaton black holes considered in @xcite and the extremal limit of some holographic superconductors @xcite , though some details will be slightly different . for example the quasiparticle width will now depend on the charge of the fermion due to the radial electric field in these backgrounds .",
    "we expect the @xmath80 limit of the models in @xcite will recover many of the details of the @xmath3 theory including the scaling exponent given in eq .",
    "( [ exponent ] ) , hence they deserve more detailed study .",
    "when the dimensions @xmath11 in the @xmath3 case lie partly on the conformal branch where @xmath81 is imaginary , a fermi sea also develops in the @xmath0 region .",
    "the backreaction from this sea changes the geometry to the lifshitz form , with a dynamical exponent that is large in the planar limit of the strongly coupled theory  @xcite . over most of the parameter space of ref .",
    "@xcite this low energy fermi sea accompanies the domain wall fermi sea , though there is a small range of parameters where the latter is absent ( this will be discussed in section 4 in more detail ) . from the semi - holographic point of view here , the bulk and boundary fermi seas are independent features .",
    "the marginal fermi liquid phenomenology  @xcite also involves a fermi sea coupled to an @xmath3-like sector , the latter having correlators that are singular at @xmath82 for all @xmath15 . in the present work , however , the two sectors are coupled through a fermion mixing interaction , whereas in the marginal fermi liquid they are coupled through bosonic operators .    in the strongly coupled cft , the operator @xmath31 is a composite of the fundamental fields . thus the semi - holographic fermi liquid has a natural interpretation describing charge carriers that have some amplitude to be pointlike and some amplitude to fragment .",
    "such fragmentation plays a major role in many attempts to understand exotic phases  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that in the present construction this fragmentation is only possible with @xmath0 scaling .",
    "the electrons near the fermi surface have large momentum , and so , except in the case that momentum does not scale , their fragments are far off shell and can not separate substantially .",
    "if the electron does fragment , it is natural to ask what it fragments into . in the supergravity limit",
    "there is no answer to this question , because the field theory is very strongly coupled ( large t hooft coupling ) .",
    "this is one of the difficulties in applying gauge / gravity duality to qcd : the partonic structure is not seen .",
    "fortunately there is a wealth of phenomena in heavy ion physics where the partons are not relevant and the t hooft coupling is of order one . in the condensed matter case , in the 2 + 1 dimensional systems where fragmentation is most often considered ,",
    "the gauge coupling again is of order one .",
    "the details of the partons may therefore not be so important  indeed , there may be several equally valid dual descriptions .",
    "thus the situation may not be so different from that in heavy ion physics .",
    "having a fundamental fermion @xmath18 coupled to the composite @xmath31 would appear to be a new ingredient outside the usual fragmentation picture . in sec .",
    "3.1 we will show that in the interesting range of parameters @xmath18 can be integrated out .",
    "relevant operators are important for two reasons : they can make the low energy physics unstable to generic quantum corrections , and they affect the phase diagram as parameters are varied .",
    "the phase diagram of the cuprates appears to be controlled by a single relevant operator , tied to the doping . ) through the chemical potential @xmath8 , but integrating out the high energy degrees of freedom will make all other parameters implicit functions of @xmath8 . writing the action  ( [ action ] ) explicitly in terms of @xmath83 is therefore somewhat deceptive .",
    "rather , the low energy kinetic term depends on the locus of @xmath84 ( the fermi surface ) and on the normal derivative of the energy , @xmath85 , both of which are functions of @xmath8 .",
    "we will see this explicitly when mapping to the @xmath2 theory in section 4 .",
    "] at large doping @xmath86 , the zero temperature behavior is that of a fermi liquid , and non - fermi liquid behavior sets in at a temperature @xmath87 .",
    "as the doping is reduced to a critical value @xmath88 , @xmath87 comes down close to zero ( when the superconducting phase is suppressed ) .",
    "below @xmath88 there is a mysterious phase with possible charge and spin inhomogeneities .",
    "as we will see , the theory we are discussing necessarily has an abundance of relevant operators .",
    "however , the low energy physics is stable , within a range of parameters",
    ". we also identify operators which may play the needed role in the phase diagram .",
    "candidate operators are the various bilinears , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .    from the action  ( [ action ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath89 has energy dimension zero and so is relevant . however , this term is already present in the action : perturbing its coefficient just moves the fermi surface , but does not destroy it . similarly the operators @xmath90 and @xmath91 are already included with generic coefficients .",
    "their dimension is @xmath11 , and so they are relevant for @xmath93 .",
    "this is just the regime where the correlator  ( [ gcorr ] ) exhibits strange behavior ( the marginal case is also of interest ) .    for genericity we should also add @xmath94 this is relevant when @xmath95 .",
    "such double - trace perturbations have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . to see their effect , consider first the decoupled @xmath31 theory at @xmath96 .",
    "as in the calculation of the propagator  ( [ gcorr ] ) , we can sum the perturbations at planar order to get @xmath97 where again @xmath98 . in the irrelevant range @xmath99 , the perturbed correlator @xmath100 approaches @xmath101 at low energy .",
    "however , for @xmath95 the low energy limit is @xmath102 the first term is a contact interaction and can be absorbed into the parameters in the action .",
    "the second , which is the leading nonlocal term , scales as @xmath103 .",
    "the relevant perturbations thus leave a critical theory but shift the dimension to @xmath104  @xcite . the fine - tuned theory with which we began is known as the alternate quantization , and it flows to the standard quantization .",
    "the low energy physics is the same as would have been obtained using @xmath105 , the standard quantization , from the start .    in summary ,",
    "the effect of generic fermionic bilinears is simply to restrict the dimensions to @xmath106 , but otherwise leave the low energy physics as before . these bilinears do not seem suitable for controlling the behavior of the phase diagram . in particular , the different directions on the fermi surface do not talk to each other , at least in the planar limit , and their coefficients are independent .",
    "thus it is difficult to see how they can account for a single relevant operator that drives the entire fermi surface critical at once , as indicated by the existence of a sharp @xmath88 .",
    "we present one more manipulation along these lines , which gives an interesting interpretation to the non - fermi surface .",
    "we can integrate out the singlet fermion @xmath18 and express the result as a boundary condition on the bulk theory .",
    "this would usually be nonlocal , because of the time derivative term in the action .",
    "however , when @xmath93 one sees from the propagator  ( [ gcorr ] ) that the time derivative is is less relevant than the interaction with the bulk .",
    "we can therefore ignore it at low energy , so that @xmath18 is effectively nondynamical .",
    "integrating @xmath18 out then gives the action @xmath107 assuming that we start with the standard quantization , the pole implies that on the fermi surface we have transformed to the alternate quantization . to see this",
    ", we evaluate the @xmath108 correlator by using the result ( [ gof ] ) with @xmath109 given by eq .",
    "( [ intout ] ) : @xmath110 the second term in the denominator scales as @xmath111 . thus , for @xmath112 this term dominates and the propagator is approximately given by a contact term plus a term that has the alternate scaling .",
    "below this frequency the correlator crosses over to the standard scaling .",
    "as we approach the fermi surface the crossover frequency goes to zero and the alternate quantization applies down to the ir ( though with an overall normalization on the correlator that goes to zero ) .",
    "see also fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and the discussion at the end of section 4.1 .      in this paper",
    "we are considering only universal properties of theories whose ir physics includes the system  ( [ action ] ) .",
    "in addition to the fermionic operators @xmath31 , this will include the energy momentum tensor and the @xmath17 density @xmath113 and current @xmath114 , under which @xmath31 is charged . in the @xmath0 theory ,",
    "the density @xmath113 has dimension zero : the dual cft is 0 + 1 dimensional , and so the current has the same scaling as the charge .",
    "the spatial derivatives also do not scale .",
    "therefore _ any function _ of @xmath113 and @xmath15 is relevant  @xcite .",
    "this is an embarrassment of riches , and may lead one to doubt that an @xmath0 fixed point can ever be realized .",
    "however , in the planar limit the rg flows induced by multi - trace operators ( functions of gauge - singlet operators ) are rather tame  @xcite .",
    "the theory flows to a new fixed point with the same conformal symmetry , and only the correlator of the perturbed operator is affected .",
    "we should also consider the single - trace operators @xmath113 as a potential relevant perturbations .",
    "we consider first the case that this is forbidden by a symmetry and the double - trace is the leading relevant term .",
    "this is somewhat unnatural for the charge density , though it may apply to spin density as we discuss in sec .",
    "3.3 . in 3.2.2",
    "we look at the single - trace perturbation .",
    "let focus on a density - squared perturbation , @xmath115 higher powers of the density are also relevant but do not affect the two - point correlator in the planar limit .",
    "the dimension zero case is rather degenerate , so let us consider a general lifshitz exponent @xmath51 . as we reduce @xmath51 the number of relevant interactions decreases , the energy dimension of the current being @xmath116 and the condition for relevance being total dimension less than @xmath117 .",
    "thus the density - squared perturbation is relevant for @xmath118  @xcite ( the marginal case @xmath119 is left for the reader ) .",
    "the charge density - density correlator in the strongly coupled theory is of the form @xmath120 the same summation that gave the fermion propagator  ( [ gcorr ] ) gives the full density - density correlator @xmath121 for @xmath122 this flows to the unperturbed  ( [ jjex ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath123 the low energy behavior is @xmath124 the leading piece is a contact term .",
    "the leading nonlocal behavior corresponds to the dimension of the density being shifted to @xmath125 , and so the density - density perturbation around this new fixed point is irrelevant .",
    "this is suggestive . at positive",
    "@xmath126 the charge fluctuations in the ir have a certain behavior .",
    "when @xmath126 is reduced to zero , these fluctuations become stronger in the ir .",
    "once @xmath126 goes negative , the correlator has a pole at nonzero @xmath61 for zero @xmath33 , indicating an instability .",
    "the enhanced fluctuations at @xmath127 may be connected with the critical behavior .",
    "if so , this is a somewhat conventional picture  @xcite .",
    "the holography is playing a role in determining the correlators in the strongly coupled theory , where the density fractionalizes  @xcite as in the earlier discussion .",
    "( one might hope that the bulk description will determine the endpoint of the @xmath128 instability , although the details here are not clear ) .",
    "however , in the end we must treat by hand the interactions between the singlet fluctuations and the fermions , unless we can find a more effective dual theory .    as a technical point",
    ", it might seem puzzling that a density such as @xmath129 could acquire an anomalous dimension , because the ward identity appears to fix its dimension via the ope @xmath130 one can perturb the terms in this relation as we have done above , with the result @xmath131 the ward identity is still satisfied , but for @xmath118 the @xmath132 makes no contribution in the ir and so the dimension of @xmath113 is not constrained .",
    "rather , the @xmath133 term , representing an outflow of charge at spatial infinity , appears in the ir and allows the spatial current term by itself to saturate the ward identity .",
    "one can give this a physical interpretation as follows .",
    "@xcite , it was noted that the ir stable quantization for @xmath118 forbids local fluctuations of the charge density ( where in the present discussion charge is replaced by spin ) . when a nonsinglet operator such as @xmath134 acts to create a local density , this must be accompanied by an outflow at infinity .",
    "the current @xmath113 is always relevant according to the standard dimensional analysis , given below eq .",
    "( [ jj ] ) .",
    "this would have a large effect on the ir : the strongly coupled cft has charged excitations of arbitrarily low energy , so adding a bulk chemical potential @xmath135 to the action will induce a density of these charges .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath0 and lifshitz geometries of @xcite this density should already be present : the @xmath0 geometry is sourced by a charged horizon , and the lifshitz geometry in @xcite is sourced by a charge density in the bulk .",

    "this should be compared to the universal result on the anomalous scaling dimension of the vector part of the current at zero momentum : @xmath147 , found in @xcite and studied further in the transverse channel at non - zero momentum in @xcite .",
    "the non - zero @xmath61 analysis for the longitudinal part of the current would be valuable to compare to the above result .    in summary",

    "perturbations involving the @xmath17 density in the uv do not destabilize the ir physics , with one notable exception : the relativistic case @xmath148 is unnatural for a cft with a @xmath17 charge , because the relativistic symmetries are broken by any charge density .",
    "there is another set of relevant operators that we can add to ( [ action ] ) which we have thus far neglected .",

    "treating @xmath153 as a vector , this respects the underlying parity symmetry but requires a spontaneous breaking of reflection symmetry in the third direction , for example by the crystal structure .",
    "when this symmetry is broken these terms can have interesting physical consequences @xcite .    allowing the terms ( [ so ] ) will be important for us because they are present in the @xmath2 theory , and must be included in order to match to that theory . in that case the reflection symmetry in the third direction is broken by the warped geometry .",
    "in particular , as we will explain below , because the strongly coupled field @xmath31 naturally does not respect this `` reflection '' symmetry it would constitute a fine tuning not to include these terms .",
    "we can diagonalize the full action in terms of the eigenbasis under reflection perpendicular to the momentum , @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the phase of @xmath156 .",
    "this is the basis that ref .",
    "@xcite works in .",
    "then , @xmath157 where , @xmath158 this term splits the degenerate fermi surfaces labeled by spin @xmath12 into two non degenerate fermi surfaces labeled by @xmath126 . for example in this basis the generalization of ( [ gcorr ] ) is found by replacing @xmath159 with @xmath160 .",
    "note that time reversal is still preserved , and simply maps @xmath161 to @xmath162 .",
    "in addition , in this basis the correlator coming from the strongly coupled sector for the @xmath31 field will be diagonal since we demand that the strongly coupled field theory respects @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "that is in ( [ gcorr ] ) we should replace @xmath165 .",
    "there is no reason for this sector to respect the `` reflection '' symmetry discussed above , thus @xmath166 and in the original spin basis the correlator will not be diagonal .",
    "note that in the supergravity approximation the dimension of @xmath31 is independent of @xmath126 , but no symmetry appears to require this at higher order .    aside from the reflection symmetry ,",
    "spin - orbit interactions are also forbidden in the extreme nonrelativistic limit , where @xmath167 emerges as an accidental symmetry ( as in heavy quark systems ) .",
    "this is often treated as an effective internal symmetry in condensed matter systems .",
    "thus we might model it by introducing an explicit @xmath168 index on the fermionic fields ; this could be the original @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) , with the additional @xmath126 index inherited from the bulk field suppressed .",
    "there will be a small symmetry breaking , from the combination of lattice and spin - orbit effects .",
    "one would then expect that the approximately conserved @xmath168 current would be holographically realized as an @xmath168 gauge symmetry in the bulk , weakly broken .",
    "the discussion of density bilinears above would extend to the spin density , where the absence of a single - trace term would usually follow from dicrete symmetries .",
    "we can attempt to include some more physics , in particular the fact that the spin fluctuations may be strongest at the antiferromagnetic point .",
    "we thus introduce a lattice as before , elaborating the perturbation to @xmath169 the resulting correlator is @xmath170 where @xmath171 in an antiferromagnetic system the coupling @xmath172 would be negative at some nonzero momentum . however",
    "( as with the earlier discussion of behavior at the fermi surface ) , for any finite @xmath51 the interesting critical behavior in the bulk is at zero momentum and does not seem to affect the antiferromagnetic point .",
    "perhaps we have not introduced the lattice physics in the most general way .",
    "one further possibility would be the introduction of constant @xmath168 gauge fields in the bulk .",
    "in general , the system we have been discussing will describe the low energy physics of some higher energy qft in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the uv theory has some leading fermionic operator @xmath173 which is represented in the cft as @xmath174 where the omitted terms include time derivatives , multitraces , and so on .",
    "since @xmath175 has dimension 0 and @xmath176 dimension at least @xmath177 , the leading low energy behavior of the correlator comes from the former , and so from the ir correlator  ( [ gcorr ] ) generalized to the @xmath126 basis we have @xmath178    in the remainder of this section we focus on the case that the uv theory is the original @xmath2 theory studied in refs .  @xcite .",
    "we will suppress the index @xmath126 wherever possible to avoid clutter .",
    "the bulk geometry is the @xmath2 ( extremal ) rn black hole . as a function of the radial",
    "coordinate this geometry represents the rg flow of the field theory triggered by turning on the relevant charge density operator @xmath179 in the uv . at scales much smaller than @xmath8",
    "the theory flows to the @xmath180 theory , where now @xmath8 represents a uv cutoff .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the low energy theory @xmath181 is universally controlled by the @xmath0 theory plus the domain wall singlet fermions . here",
    "we explore this interpretation .",
    "the fermionic operator @xmath182 in the uv cft can be considered with general scaling dimension @xmath183 and charge @xmath184 .",
    "the fermionic correlators can be written as @xcite , @xmath185 where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are only calculable numerically order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "the ir dimension is fixed by the specific @xmath180 theory to be @xcite , @xmath188 where @xmath189 is an order one number fixed by the normalization of the current two point function .",
    "it would be useful to understand how robust this relation is , or whether there are other @xmath0 theories which give different scaling dimensions .    as discussed in @xcite",
    "the condition for the appearance of a fermi surface is @xmath190 . expanding at low energy , this matches the general result  ( [ uvcorr ] ) up to a contact term , with the identifications @xmath191 ) we would have to include general time derivatives in the expansion  ( [ uvir ] ) , and also go to higher order in the expansion  ( [ linear ] ) of the low energy action .",
    "for @xmath192 the observation at the end of section 3.1 gives a nice picture of the rg flow represented by the @xmath2 theory .",
    "since we can now ignore the free field @xmath193 in favor of the interacting field @xmath194 in the ir cft , we can match directly onto the @xmath180 theory via the strongly interacting fermionic operator in that theory ; @xmath195 we must also specify the presence of an irrelevant double - trace deformation as in ( [ fm ] ) , @xmath196 after which the @xmath31 correlator is given by the earlier result  ( [ intout2 ] ) .",
    "it is natural that under rg flow all multi - trace relevant operators in the ir theory not protected by a symmetry should be turned on .",
    "hence we expect naturally the ir theory is in its standard quantization .",
    "however , we have seen in sec .",
    "3.1 that it is precisely on the fermi surface that we are tuned to the alternate quantization , and the ir fluctuations are enhanced .",
    "generically this tuning will happen on a codimension one surface in momentum space .",
    "as we move away from the fermi surface , the alternate quantization holds only down to a crossover scale @xmath197 .",
    "this interpretation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we flow in the uv theory ( denoted @xmath2 ) to the theory at the uv end of the ir cft ( denoted @xmath0 ) .",
    "this ir cft has an infinite number of double - trace couplings , indexed by @xmath15 . for @xmath15 near the fermi surface , the coupling lingers for a long time near the unstable fixed point corresponding to the alternate quantization , while values of @xmath15 further from the fermi surface cross over sooner .",

    "this interpretation explains the universal behavior recently found for the transport @xcite and thermodynamics @xcite of this model when @xmath192 .",
    "such an interpretation for @xmath201 is hampered by the now relevance of the time derivative term in ( [ action ] ) .",
    "thus the low energy effective theory is no longer just the @xmath0 theory . indeed , close to the fermi surface the theory is now controlled by the free fermion @xmath18",
    ".    it would be interesting to match the low energy gauge field sector of the @xmath2 theory to the discussion of bosonic bilinears in the last section . this may help to track the instability identified for the density bilinear .",

    "the space of possible low energy theories ( [ action ] ) that can be constructed with this @xmath2 theory was examined in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we generalize these results by allowing for double - trace fermion operators in the @xmath2 theory .",
    "we start by considering relevant operators , noting that there is potentially another natural candidate for the doping .",
    "however we then note that since the uv cft is not governing the low energy physics the distinction between irrelevant and relevant in the uv is immaterial .",
    "both should alter the low energy physics only through their effect on the already identified relevant operators in the low energy effective action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "in particular the cutoff scale @xmath8 above which the @xmath2 theory is important should be at the same scale as the lattice scale and as such we should include possible lattice effects .",
    "we only briefly explore this possibility .",
    "we will restrict our attention to the region where the bulk fermi sea does not back react on the @xmath0 geometry as in @xcite .",
    "this condition is equivalent to requiring @xmath11 is real for all @xmath61 , or @xmath202 this corresponds to the regions of fig .",
    "6 of ref .",
    "@xcite below the dashed lines .",
    "there are only zeros ( shaded areas in that figure ) of @xmath203 in the bottom left wedge of the @xmath204 component ( and none in the @xmath205 component . )",
    "this is when @xmath206 and @xmath207 ; which is exactly the critical region of the @xmath0 theory and in the alternative quantization of the @xmath2 theory .",
    "this means from the uv theory perspective there are relevant double - trace operators which when turned on will induce a flow to a theory without a fermi surface @xcite . here",
    "we extend this observation and note that this flow is quite interesting , in particular how the fermi surface disappears depends on the sign of the double - trace coupling .",
    "more specifically we will add to the action the following , @xmath208 which is like a chemical potential for @xmath209 distinct from @xmath8 .",
    "note one could also add the relevent , lorentz invariant term @xmath210 , but this violates @xmath164 and @xmath163 in @xmath44 dimensions , so we will not include it .",

    "suppressing @xmath126 dependence , we can sum the double - trace perturbations as before , @xmath212 there is now a zero - frequency pole of the propagator at @xmath213 as @xmath214 increases the fermi momentum @xmath215 increases and diverges as @xmath216 . decreasing @xmath214 the fermi surface vanishes beyond some point @xmath217 .",
    "indeed @xmath214 may be a candidate for the doping although no new critical behavior will happen as a function of @xmath214 and there is nothing to single out @xmath36 as special .    in figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    "some flows under @xmath214 were constructed explicitly with the @xmath2 theory .",
    "note that the @xmath0 exponent @xmath218 increases as a function of @xmath214 ; for fixed @xmath219 it now varies from @xmath220 , a much larger parameter space than discussed earlier .",
    "it is interesting to note from the middle curve in figure  [ fig:2 ] , which has @xmath221 , that there can now exist fermi surfaces ( of non - zero size ) when the fermion is uncharged . also for @xmath221 the spin orbit terms ( [ so ] ) are naturally zero , presumably due to a particle - hole symmetry .",
    "one thing to take away from this section is that the size of the fermi surface in the @xmath2 model can be tuned independently of @xmath8 .",
    "this will be useful in isolating and studying the thermodynamic properties of the fermi surface , including their response to an external magnetic field already studied in @xcite .",

    "the splitting due to spin orbit coupling increases with @xmath184 , and is absent here for @xmath221 . note that the ir scaling dimension @xmath218 increases with `` doping '' because it increases with @xmath215 . ]",
    "notice there is nothing special about the point @xmath226 .",
    "the reason for this is the uv cft is not controlling the physics of the fermi surface .",
    "indeed since @xmath215 is at the same scale as the cutoff scale @xmath8 , the lattice size should also be at the scale @xmath227 .",
    "so there is no reason not to include general irrelevant and relevant deformations at this scale , ones that break translation and rotation invariance , to mimic the effects of a lattice .",
    "this is easier to achieve using double - trace deformations , although there is no reason to not turn on single - trace operators ; it is just much harder to analyze",
    ".    consider adding to the @xmath2 theory the @xmath228 deformation but now modulated on the scale of the lattice , @xmath229 .",
    "then the two point function can be shown to be , @xmath230 as above we can match this theory onto ( [ action ] ) where we must now restrict the momentum @xmath231 to the unit cell of the reciprocal lattice , and allow for a coupling as in ( [ umk ] ) . for example",
