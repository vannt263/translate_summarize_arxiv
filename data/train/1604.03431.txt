    "renormalization group ( rg ) was discovered by stueckelberg and petermann as a group of infinitesimal reparametrizations of the @xmath7 matrix emerging after the cancellation of ultraviolet divegences @xcite .",
    "the rg method has become known in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) since gell - mann and low , using the functional equation for the renormalized photon propagator , have shown the charge distribution surrounding a test charge in vacuum does not at small distances depend on a coupling constant , except for a scale factor , _",
    "i.e. , _ possesses a kind of self - similarity , that enables to express a  bare  charge at small scale using the measured value at large scale @xcite .",
    "this result was latter generalized for massive propagators and vertices in qed using the theory of the lie groups , from where the term _ renormalization group _ comes @xcite .",
    "the latter result does not refer to the existence of the  bare  charges and is just a set of group functional relations between the vertices and the propagators at different scales .",
    "the rg method has become popular in utmost all branches of science when entered both the statistical physics and the field theory as a method of treating fluctuations of different scales not all at once , but successively scale by scale @xcite .",
    "this resulted in an elegant theory of critical phenomena and was later generalized to many other stochastic systems @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the same idea of separating the fluctuations of different scales has been implemented , basically in experimental data processing , in a quite different way : using wavelets .",
    "this was first done in geophysics @xcite , and then spread over all possible data , from face recognition and medical imaging to high energy physics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "the only intersection of the rg and the wavelet method seems to be the the lattice regularization in quantum field theory ( qft ) , which can be performed either by standard lattice methods , or by using the the discrete wavelet basis @xcite .",
    "the connections between these two seemingly different methods are still missing .",
    "the present paper is an endeavor to unify the rg method with the continuous wavelet transform . to make the consideration simple a theory of a massive scalar field in euclidean space",
    "is considered .    to illustrate the method we start with euclidean scalar field theory with @xmath6 interaction in @xmath8 defined by the generating functional @xmath9 & = & { \\mathcal{n}}\\int \\exp\\left(-s_e[\\phi ] + \\int j(x)\\phi(x ) d^dx\\right ) , \\label{gf}\\\\ \\nonumber \\hbox{where\\ } & & s_e[\\phi ] = \\int d^dx \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial\\phi)^2 + \\frac{m^2}{2 } \\phi^2    + \\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the euclidean action of the theory , @xmath10 is a formal normalization constant .",

    "the perturbation expansion of the green functions starts with the bare value of the coupling constant @xmath18 , which corresponds to the interaction strength on certain ( uv ) scale to be dressed by interactions .",
    "if the theory is subjected to the uv cutoff @xmath19 , in one loop approximation , we get @xmath20 so that the inversion of this formula with respect to @xmath17 yields the increase of the interaction strength for the small scales : @xmath21 similar results are obtained with dimensional regularization scheme @xcite .    in the next two sections",
    "i ll remind the construction of the scale - dependent field theory using wavelets and present the scale dependence of the vertex functions in one loop approximation .",
    "the differences between the multiscale theory and the standard one are outlined in conclusions .",
    "continuous wavelet transform is a generalization of the fourier transform for the case when the scaling properties of the theory are important . referring the reader to general reviews on wavelet",
    "transform @xcite , and to the original papers devoted to the application of wavelet transform to quantum field theory @xcite , below we remind the basic definitions of the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory .",
    "let @xmath22 be a hilbert space of states for a quantum field @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be a locally compact lie group acting transitively on @xmath22 , with @xmath25 being a left - invariant measure on @xmath24 .",
    "similarly to the fourier representation @xmath26 can be decomposed with respect to a representation @xmath27 of @xmath24 in @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is referred to as an admissible vector , or a _ basic wavelet _ , satisfying the admissibility condition @xmath30 the coefficients @xmath31 are referred to as wavelet coefficients .",
    "if the group @xmath24 is abelian , the wavelet transform coincides with the fourier transform .",
    "next to the abelian group is the group of the affine transformations of the euclidean space @xmath8 : @xmath32 ( for the sake of simplicity we assume the isotropic basic wavelet @xmath33 and drop the @xmath34 rotation factor . )",
    "the unitary representation of the affine transform with respect to the isotropic basic wavelet @xmath35 can be written as follows : @xmath36 ( in accordance to previous papers @xcite we use @xmath37 norm @xcite instead of usual @xmath38 to keep the physical dimension of wavelet coefficients equal to the dimension of the original fields ) .",

    "the feynman diagram technique for the scale - dependent fields @xmath43 is the same as for ordinary fields except for @xcite :    * each field @xmath51 will be substituted by the scale component @xmath52 . *",
    "each integration in momentum variable is accompanied by corresponding scale integration : @xmath53 * each interaction vertex is substituted by its wavelet transform ; for the @xmath54-th power interaction vertex this gives multiplication by factor @xmath55 .    according to these rules ,",
    "the bare green function in wavelet representation takes the form @xmath56 the finiteness of the loop integrals is provided by the following rule : _ there should be no scales @xmath57 in internal lines smaller than the minimal scale of all external lines _ @xcite . therefore the integration in @xmath57 variables",
    "is performed from the minimal scale of all external lines up to the infinity .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption , that studying a system from outside one should not used functions with resolution better than the finest experimentally available scale .",
    "the integration over _ all _ scales will certainly drive us back to the known divergent theory .",
    "being originated as a method of eliminating divergences , the rg technique has further evolved to a functional method , referred to as the _ functional , or exact , renormalization group _ @xcite , which deal with the so - called _ effective average action _",
    "@xmath58 @xcite , which accounts for the fluctuations of momenta greater than @xmath59 . in this way",
    "the effective action @xmath58 is a functional of fields from which the physical properties at a given scale can be computed .",
    "the ir limit of the effective action is the exact action , @xmath60 ; in the uv limit all fluctuations are suppressed and the effective action turns to the bare action @xmath61 .    technically the effective action is constructed by the addition of a quadratic regularization term @xmath62=\\frac{1}{2 } \\int \\frac{d^dq}{(2\\pi)^d } \\phi(-q)r_k(q)\\phi(q)\\ ] ] to the euclidean action of the theory .",

    "the main instrument of the exact renormalization group is the flow equation @xmath65 , which generates the rg flow from large to small scales and allows to study the scale behavior of the coupling constant if its value at some reference scale is known .",
    "what is proposed in this paper is in some way complementary to the effective action @xmath58 of the erg , i.e. , it similar to @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , according to the above listed feynman rules for the multi - scale theory ( see @xcite for details ) , and to the definition of the effective action , we can define the action functional @xmath67 $ ] , where @xmath68 is the minimal scale of all external lines of the contributing diagrams .",
    "this functional @xmath4 incorporates the scale components of all fields @xmath43 with @xmath69 .",
    "physically the scale of observation @xmath1 , at which the coupling constant @xmath70 is called @xmath71 , is not necessarily the @xmath72 limit : it may be large but finite size of the system .",
    "_ vice versa _ , the uv limit @xmath73 should not necessarily exist . in statistical physics @xmath1 should not be less than the mean free path , or less than the lattice constant in solid state physics . in quantum field theory",

    "we proceed with the @xmath6 theory at one loop level now . substituting the wavelet",

    "[ v24:pic ] .",
    "they are @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the dimension of euclidean space , @xmath82 is the dimensionless scale of the tadpole diagram , for the inverse propagator ; and similarly , @xmath83 for the one loop contribution to the vertex function",
    ". the vertex functions @xmath84 obey standard functional equations , _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath85 , which is a projection of the unity to a given scale , so that the trace is 1 .",

    "the best choice of the basic wavelet would be the apparatus function of the measuring device which defines the space of functions @xmath92 .",
    "working in euclidean space we ought to make some simplifying assumptions .",
    "so , using @xmath93 as the basic wavelet we can easily calculate the beta function and the anomalous dimension of the effective mass in our model by taking the derivatives of equations ( [ g2l1],[g4l1 ] ) with respect to the logarithm of scale variable @xmath94 . for the @xmath93 wavelet in one - loop approximation",
    "this gives the flow equations @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the dimensionless scale , @xmath97 is the exponential integral of the first type .    for small",
    "@xmath98 the equation tends to the known result .",
    "the last term in tends to zero for small @xmath98 .    to show the group composition law for the scale - dependent coupling constant @xmath70",
    ", we have to analyze a universal function @xmath99 , that express the value of the coupling constant at a certain scale @xmath100 using its value at another scale @xmath101 , which depends only on scale ratio and the coupling constant value : @xmath102    let us assume @xmath103 and consider the recursive relation @xmath104 in one loop approximation for the scale dependence of the coupling constant . substituting @xmath105}\\ ] ] into @xmath106}\\ ] ] we get @xmath107 } + o(\\lambda^4),\\ ] ] where the integrals over the measure @xmath108 were added .",
    "therefore the value of the coupling constant depends only on its value at the reference scale and on the ratio of scales .",
    "the method of rg has got a clear physical interpretation in the self - similarity picture of phase transitions . following k.wilson @xcite , in the context of phase transitions ,",
    "the rg method is usually understood as the integration over small scale degrees of freedom is such a way that the remaining large scale degrees of freedom gain an interaction hamiltonian different from the initial one only by scale transformation of the fields and coupling constants .",
    "this is accompanied by a coarse - graining procedure , performed at each iteration step .",
    "these iterations can be represented by the same pair of the projection operators @xmath109 and @xmath24 , that are used in discrete wavelet transform , see e.g , @xcite . the coarse - graining operator @xmath109 is often referred to as a low - pass filter , the  details operator ",
    "@xmath24 is referred to as the high - pass filter .",
    "starting from some initial fine scale fields @xmath110 the iteration goes to coarse scales @xmath111 with the details ( @xmath112 ) integrated out at each step of iteration , and the final results formulated on ( @xmath113 ) space . since the same functional space @xmath114 , or @xmath115 , is used for all steps of iteration , the coupling constant obtained in such averaging process for the rescaled fields @xmath116 is the effective interaction constant for all scales larger than a given scale .",
    "surprisingly , the pair of projection operators @xmath109 and @xmath24 have been already used in the ising model by g.baker @xcite  without knowing that was a haar wavelet ,  who has thrown away the inter - block interactions to meet the scaling results of k.wilson @xcite ( although the integrals were analytic in their full form ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper was to show that instead of a sequence of spaces @xmath117 , which approximates the functional space @xmath118 of the considered problem , it is possible to formulate the theory completely in terms of the  details spaces  , i.e. on @xmath119 space , which is dense in @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast to the nested sequence of @xmath120 , the @xmath121 spaces are maximally uncorrelated and their sum represents the most compact record of information on the analyzed function @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the considered model that the order of integration from small scales to large scales is not obligatory .",
    "since the details spaces of different spaces are independent , the integration can be performed from large scales to small scales , adding new details at each step down to the prescribed finest scale @xmath68 .",
    "this approach does not assume any divergences @xcite .",
    "the finest resolution scale @xmath68 is restricted only by the physics of the problem , and the existence of @xmath122 limit is not required . using the  details spaces  instead of the nested set of coarse - grained spaces we get rid of the fields renormalization and",
    "yield only the renormalization of parameters .",
    "the interaction terms of the form @xmath123 in the present formalism describe the interaction of the field fluctuations of different scales , rather than the interaction of all fluctuations up to a given scale , as in the wilson theory .",
    "the physics of universality , the presence of fixed points , etc .",
    ", in this representation can be attributed to the assumption that the scale invariance of fundamental interactions may be of the same importance as their internal symmetries , and we ought to formulate the theory on the space @xmath124 of functions @xmath43 using appropriate invariant measure . the difference between the resolution @xmath1 , and the ordinary variables , such as @xmath0 , @xmath125 , etc , is that the resolution @xmath1 is neither a dynamical variable , nor a physical observable .",
