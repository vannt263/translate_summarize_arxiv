    "the centre of the homunculus lies @xmath0  caritself , an extremely luminous ( @xmath5 ) and highly eccentric ( @xmath6 ) binary with a 5.54  yr orbit @xcite .",
    "the primary component , @xmath1 , is a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) and our closest example of a supermassive star ( @xmath7  kpc , @xmath8 , @xmath9  k ; @xcite ) .",
    "the secondary , @xmath3 , is thought to be a hotter ( @xmath10  36,00041,000  k ) , but less luminous ( @xmath11   ) , o- or wolf rayet - type star @xcite .    because they are so luminous , both components of @xmath0  carhave powerful radiation - driven stellar winds .",
    "multiwavelength observations obtained over the last two decades @xcite indicate that @xmath1 s slow , extremely dense wind ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; @xcite ) collides with @xmath3 s less dense ( @xmath14 ) , but much faster ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) , wind .",

    "wind collision ( wwc ) produces the shock - heated gas responsible for the observed time - variable 210  kev x - ray emission @xcite that is a key signature of a colliding wind binary @xcite .",
    "the wwc , orbital motion , and presence of @xmath3lead to numerous other forms of time - variable emission and absorption seen across a wide range of wavelengths ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "observational signatures that arise as a result of the wwc and @xmath3 s ionizing radiation are important for studying @xmath0  caras they provide crucial information about the physical properties of the stars and the system as a whole .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamical simulations show that the fast wind of @xmath3has a significant impact on shaping the wind of @xmath1@xcite , affecting greatly the observed optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of the system , as well as the interpretation of various line profiles and interferometric observables @xcite .",

    "a very important series of spectral features that have fascinated and perplexed researchers of @xmath0  carfor decades are those due to helium .",
    "it was the periodic variation of the @xmath1710830 emission line that originally led to the discovery of binarity in @xmath0  car@xcite , and it is the disappearance of the narrow emission - line component of @xmath176678 that is typically used to define the starting point of a 5.54  yr spectroscopic cycle @xcite .",
    "present - day broad wind lines of , most notably @xmath177067 , are thought to be excited by the uv radiation of @xmath3and arise somewhere in / near the wwir between the stars @xcite .",
    "since the lines are recombination lines , they are produced in regions of rather than regions of neutral he .",
    "the locations of the strongest broad emission features are spatially unresolved in _ hubble space telescope _",
    "data , and almost certainly originate less than @xmath2100200  au from @xmath1@xcite .",
    "the broad emission lines are consistently blueshifted throughout most of the 5.54  yr orbit and exhibit an interesting double peak profile that varies in intensity and velocity , especially across periastron passage @xcite",
    ".    the broad p  cygni absorption components also vary in velocity and strength over @xmath0  car s entire 5.54  yr period .",
    "the absorption is strongest in the two - year interval centred on periastron , and relatively weak at other phases @xcite .",
    "the absorption is always blueshifted , and hence must be produced by material between the observer and the continuum source @xmath1 , although there is still some debate over whether the absorption is directly related to material in the wwir @xcite or produced by the pre - shock wind of @xmath1@xcite .    further complicating the story is the observed gradual increase in the amount of p  cygni absorption over the last @xmath210  yr . since 1998 , and most especially after the 2009 event , the strength of the absorption has increased compared to similar phases of previous cycles , while the emission strength has remained essentially unchanged @xcite . @xcite attribute this and other recent observed changes to a gradual decrease of @xmath1 s mass - loss rate by a factor of @xmath223 between 1999 and 2010 .",
    "it is hypothesized that this decrease in @xmath1mass - loss rate led to important changes in the ionization structure of @xmath1 s wind and the wwirs , as caused by the presence of @xmath3(see e.g. fig .  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , this idea has yet to be quantitatively tested or modelled , and the results of 3d smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations appear to argue against such a large , gradual change in @xmath1 s mass - loss rate ( see * ? ? ? * hereafter m13 ) .",
    "finally , there is the mystery regarding the origin of @xmath0  car s @xmath174686 emission , which is only seen strongly around periastron ( between phases @xmath18 and 1.03 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the locations and physical mechanisms that give rise to this emission in @xmath0  carare not completely agreed upon , although several possible scenarios have been proposed ( @xcite ; ) . the key difficulty with determining which scenario , if any , is correct is the lack of any detailed quantitative modelling of the 3d ionization structure of the innermost stellar winds and wwir .",
    "the goal of this paper is to compute full 3d rt simulations of the effects of @xmath3 s ionizing radiation on @xmath0  car s inner winds and wwir , focusing on the ionization structure of helium at orbital phases around apastron ( i.e. the spectroscopic high state ;",

    "we employ a methodology nearly identical to that in , but use an updated version of simplex , which contains several important improvements over the version used in .",

    "we assign to the nucleus of each voronoi cell the corresponding sph density , computed using the standard sph cubic spline kernel @xcite .",
    "this helps ensure that the number density used in the simplexcalculations closely matches that of the original sph simulations .",
    "note that this approach differs from that used by , wherein the simplexdensity is obtained by dividing the sph particle mass by the corresponding voronoi cell volume . using the sph kernel produces smoother densities than the voronoi cell - volume approach , since the sph kernel samples a larger number of particles over a larger volume , resulting in densities that are less affected by local differences in the sph particle distribution ( see fig .",

    "comparison with a direct visualization of the sph density output ( using splash , @xcite , left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : moverv_vs_sph ] ) shows that the sph kernel approach indeed matches better the density distribution of the original sph simulations .",
    "[ fig : dens_mesh ] shows an example of the simplexmesh and number density at apastron for a representative 3d sph simulation of @xmath0  car .      as in , we perform the rt calculations in post - processing .",
    "we consider the ionization of hydrogen and helium atoms by both photo- and collisional ionization .",
    "the ionization rate equations are solved on a time - step smaller than the rt time - step to ensure photon conservation @xcite .",
    "this can lead to very small time - steps in cells where the photoionization time - scale is very small . to speed up the computation in these cells , we instead use the time - averaged optical depth to compute the photoionization rate and iterate for convergence @xcite .      in numerical simulations involving radiation",
    "it is necessary to approximate the continuous spectrum of radiation with a finite number of discrete frequency bins due to memory requirements . in , the extreme limit of a single frequency bin ,",
    "commonly referred to as the ` grey approximation ' , was used .",
    "although in the grey approximation all spectral information is lost , it is still possible to enforce the conservation of a quantity of importance such as the number of ionizations per unit time or the energy deposition into the medium per unit time .",
    "however , since in this work we are interested in the detailed ionization structure of he , and we want to capture the behaviour of the product of the spectrum and cross - sections in sufficient detail , we now employ three frequency bins .",
    "the width of each frequency bin is set by the ionization energy of each species .",
    "the first bin ranges from the ionization frequency of (=  hz ) to that of (=  hz ) , the second from to (  hz ) , and the third from to a maximum frequency equal to 10 times .",
    "we use an effective cross - section representation to determine the correct number of absorptions within each frequency bin . in this case , the limits of integration in equations  7 and 8 of are over the frequency range of the bin of interest .",
    "in , photons were transported across the simplexgrid using ballistic transport . with this method , the incoming direction of the photons",
    "is used to define the outgoing direction , and the outgoing photons are distributed in 3d over the three most forward edges of the delaunay triangulation .",
    "one drawback of this approach is that , due to the random nature of the outgoing directions in the delaunay grid , the radiation may lose track of the original incoming direction after many steps .",
    "if the cells are optically thin , this can result in a radiation field that is too diffusive , leading to overestimates of the ionization fractions . to solve this problem , the original direction of the photons",
    "is preserved by confining them to solid angles corresponding to global directions in space .",
    "this is known as direction - conserving transport ( dct ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in dct ,",
    "if a photon is emitted in a certain direction associated with a solid angle , it will remember this direction and , unless it interacts with atoms on the grid , it will stay in the same solid angle as it travels through the grid .",
    "this effectively decouples the directionality of the radiation field from the directions present in the grid . in this work ,",
    "we use 84 directions with dct , implying a solid angle of @xmath46/21  sr for each unit vector .",
    "based on @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we consider @xmath3to be an o5 giant with @xmath47  k. we assume a total ionizing flux for h and he of photons @xcite .    as described in section  [ ssec : simplex3 ] , we use three bins to sample the spectrum , which we approximate with a blackbody .",
    "we are therefore interested in the number of ionizing photons in each bin , @xmath48 , which depends on the blackbody temperature :    @xmath49     + where the @xmath50 are the limiting wavelengths for the ionization of ( @xmath51   ) , ( @xmath52   ) and ( @xmath53   ) , and @xmath54 is the planck spectrum    @xmath55)^{-1}.\\ ] ]    in @xcite , the fluxes able to ionize h and he are defined as    @xmath56     + where @xmath57 is the flux expressed in @xmath58 .",
    "we set the blackbody temperature to the value that produces the correct ratio @xmath59 ( in this case @xmath60  k ) , in accordance to the @xmath61 ratio in @xcite .",
    "@xmath62 is effectively zero for @xmath3 .",
    "when visualizing the simplexsimulation output , we would ideally like to render physical quantities that are centred on the original voronoi cells that compose our 3d unstructured grid .",
    "unfortunately , the voronoi cells consist of a series of irregular @xmath63-sided polygons , which makes their visualization quite complex . instead , it is much more straightforward to visualize the corresponding delaunay triangulation . in 3d ,",
    "the delaunay cells are tetrahedra , which can be visualized using standard visualization tools such as visit .",
    "since the delaunay cells are tetrahedra , the quantity we visualize is the average of the four vertices that define the tetrahedron cell ( i.e. the average of the four voronoi nuclei ) .",
    "this approach works well for visualizing most physical quantities ( e.g. temperature , density , velocity ) .",
    "however , if neighbouring voronoi nuclei have values which are significantly different ( i.e. by several orders of magnitude ) , this ` volume - average ' approach may lead to tetrahedral - cell values that are difficult to interpret .    unfortunately , the fractions of , , and can span 10 or more orders of magnitude across the wwir in @xmath0  car .",
    "the volume - averaged fractions in the larger grid cells that define the post - shock secondary wind can therefore be difficult to understand , especially when a logarithmic colour scale is used ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : min_vs_average ] ) . as an example , consider the fraction of near the contact discontinuity ( cd ) in the wwir .",
    "if three of the vertices of a tetrahedron cell are highly ionized and have extremely low fractions of ( @xmath64 ) , while the fourth vertex has a large fraction of ( @xmath65 ) , the final fraction visualized over the _",
    "entire _ cell will be @xmath20.25 .",
    "this simply tells us that @xmath66% of the cell s volume is .",
    "the problem is that the visualization of the fraction alone tells us nothing about _",
    "@xmath225% of the cell volume is , nor does it tell us directly what percentage of the remaining @xmath275% of the cell volume is or . therefore , while correct , the visualized plots of various ionization fractions can be deceiving , since for certain species they give the appearance of physically incorrect locations for the ionization fronts . in our example , there appears to be a thick region of near the cd in the hot , post - shock secondary wind ( top - middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : min_vs_average ] ) , even though the gas in this region is extremely hot ( @xmath4@xmath67  k , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_temp_xy ] ) , and should consist entirely of .    therefore , instead of the average , we show the minimum vertex value for the fraction of and the maximum vertex value for the fraction of . for",
    ", we show the maximum value whenever the tetrahedron consists of vertices that are only from the primary wind , and the minimum otherwise ( if we were to simply show the minimum of the fraction everywhere , we would underestimate the penetration of @xmath3 s he - ionizing radiation into @xmath1 s pre - shock wind ) .",
    "this choice for visualizing our simulations shows an _ upper _ limit to the ionization state of he , in the sense that it shows the maximum extent of the ionization front ( bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : min_vs_average ] ) . by using this approach",
    ", the ionization structure of he much better follows the temperature structure of the gas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_temp_xy ] ) in places where collisional ionization dominates .",
    "therefore , the physics in our simulations is more truthfully represented .",
    "we emphasize that the visualizations are merely to help guide the reader , and neither the physics nor the conclusions of our work depend on them .",
    "we focus on the ionization of he at an orbital phase of apastron assuming the same abundance by number of he relative to h as @xcite , @xmath68 .",
    "we employ a single photoionizing source located at the position of @xmath3 .",
    "details on the nature and implementation of the @xmath3spectrum are described in section  [ ssec : source ] .",
    "collisional ionization equilibrium of the sph simulation snapshot is used as an initial condition for the simplexsimulations .",
    "the sph output is post - processed with simplexuntil the ionization state reaches an equilibrium value ( this typically happens within @xmath212  months of simulation time ) .",
    "we use a simulation time - step of @xmath25  min , which is sufficiently small for accurate rt calculations of the ionization volumes and fractions .    for simplicity , we neglect the influence of the wwir x - rays on the he ionization structure at times around apastron since they are highly inefficient at ionizing he .      as in",
    ", we neglect the @xmath1ionizing source for simplicity .",
    "we also do not consider the ionization structure of hydrogen ( although it is included in our calculations ) . in this work ,",

    "is fully ionized throughout the entire @xmath1wind ( @xmath69  au ) .    due to the smaller domain size of the simulations used in this paper ( @xmath70  au ) , and",

    ", we might gain information about the ionization state of h in the cold , post - shock @xmath1gas , but this depends strongly on the population of the @xmath71 state of in this region and the @xmath1ionizing source .",
    "lower energy ( 10.2  ev ) photons could populate the @xmath71 state of any in the post - shock @xmath1gas , which could then be ionized to by 3.4  ev photons .",

    "the energy level structure of he is such that high - energy photons ( @xmath219.8  ev ) are needed to populate even the lowest excited states @xcite .",
    "@xmath3is the only known source of such photons in @xmath0  car .",
    "lines are thought to represent the highly excited regions of @xmath1 s wind and/or the wwir @xcite .",

    ". the inner @xmath1   region would be effectively transparent to such photons , which may allow them to pass through to the zone on the back side of @xmath1(the side facing away from @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , determining the correct overall he ionization structure requires some method of mimicking the internal ionization structure of he in @xmath1 s pre - shock wind due solely to @xmath1 .    the simplest method , which we employ for this work , is to set as an initial condition to the simplexsimulations the ionization structure of in @xmath1 s inner wind . to do this",
    ", we set the temperature in the innermost @xmath1wind to 50,000  k , which is hot enough to singly - ionize to , but not .",
    "the outer radius of this inner region for each simulation case is set to the appropriate value based on the 1d cmfgen models of @xmath0  carby @xcite , namely , 3  au , 7.5  au , and 120  au for cases  a , b , and c , respectively ( see fig .  [",

[ fig : dens_temp_xy ] and [ fig : dens_temp_xz ] display the number density and temperature in the orbital and @xmath74 planes for simulation cases  a  c . due to the smaller spatial size of these simulations , the density and temperature structures are less complex than those described in .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the lower density faster @xmath3wind carves a large cavity out of the slower , denser wind of @xmath1for the majority of the orbital period . around apastron ,",
    "this cavity and the wwir have an nearly axisymmetric conical shape , with the opening angle increasing as the value of decreases .",

    "note also the ` bent wing ' geometry of the ionization front that penetrates into @xmath1 s pre - shock wind in case  b , which is caused by the radial dependence of the density in @xmath1 s wind .",

    "a and b , there is also a noticeable asymmetry in ionization between the leading and trailing arms of the wwir .",
    "the leading arm shows a higher ( in value ) and wider ( in spatial extent ) presence of , both in the post - shock primary wind and the unperturbed primary wind .",
    "a possible explanation for this difference might be found in the slight differences in temperature and density between the two arms .",
    "since the leading arm of the wwir has higher gas temperatures , -ionizing photons may be able to more easily penetrate the post - shock @xmath3gas in the leading arm , causing more ionization of the pre- and post - shock @xmath1wind .",

    "the ionization structure in this plane exhibits the same trends , as a function of , as the orbital plane .",

    "however , there is one striking difference , namely , the structure of in the case  b simulation . in this case , the structures on the primary side of the cd are much smaller in the @xmath74 plane than those in the orbital plane .",
    "we speculate that this may be due to the less turbulent nature of the wwir in the plane perpendicular to the orbital motion .",
    "instabilities in the wwir may be more prevalent in the orbital plane , causing gaps to arise in the post - shock @xmath1wind that allow -ionizing photons from @xmath3to more easily penetrate into the pre - shock @xmath1wind . however , detailed studies of the 3d structure of complex wwirs ( like those in @xmath0  car ) in regions above and below the orbital plane , and how various instabilities affect this structure , currently do not exist in the literature .",
    "future detailed simulations of such 3d wwirs are necessary to determine if our interpretation is correct .",
    "our simplexresults show that , assuming for @xmath3a typical ionizing flux appropriate for an o - type star with @xmath80  k , @xmath3singly - ionizes he throughout its unshocked wind , as expected . moreover , extremely high temperatures ( @xmath4@xmath67  k ) cause he to be doubly - ionized in the post - shock @xmath3gas . our results also help rule out very low values of approaching  .",

    "the ionized volume is even bigger if one includes the he ionization structure of @xmath1 s inner wind , wherein @xmath1already singly - ionizes he out to a radius of @xmath2120  au in its wind @xcite .",
    "this makes it easier for ionizing photons from @xmath3to penetrate @xmath1 s wind and enlarge the he ionization zone .",
    "in such a scenario , one would expect a significant amount of @xmath174686 emission from the dense , ionized primary wind and wwir , even around apastron , which is not observed @xcite .",
    "the strength of the emission in the broad lines is also expected to be much stronger than observed if were so low @xcite .",
    "a similar situation is envisioned in case  b , namely , stronger and emission lines compared to case  a. this is true even though the inner ionization radius produced by @xmath1 in its wind is much smaller than in case  c. however , -ionizing photons are still able to penetrate the dense wwir and ionize a significant volume of @xmath1 s pre - shock wind .",
    "determining the strength of such he emission lines in case  b is beyond the scope of this paper , so we unfortunately can not rule out at this time that such emission would be in direct disagreement with observations . still , we would naively expect , based on our results , significant detectable emission at times around apastron , which is currently not observed .",
    "thus , case  b (  ) may represent a lower limit on the current value of .",

    "both of these facts indicate that the side of the system facing us is more ionized than the far side of @xmath1 s wind .",

    "the simulations clearly show that with apastron on the observer s side of the system , @xmath3ionizes portions of the wwir and pre - shock @xmath1wind flowing towards the observer .",
    "thus , for most of the orbit , the emission lines would form mostly in the blueshifted part of @xmath1 s wind , consistent with the observations .",
    "the double , and sometimes multiple , peak profiles observed in emission are consistent with emission arising from spatially separated regions in the wwir .",

    "[ fig : ion_he_xy ] and [ fig : ion_he_xz ] ) are very likely the sources of these emission peaks",
    ". the broader general component of the emission likely arises in both the central @xmath1wind ( due to ionization by @xmath1itself ) and the larger ionization zone within the pre - shock @xmath1wind located near the wwir apex .",
    "the observed absorption is also blueshifted over @xmath0  car s entire spectroscopic cycle , but is relatively weak around apastron @xcite . based on our modelling ,",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the absorption arises in the ionized pre - shock primary wind located near the wwir apex , and the ionized portions of the wwir ( specifically , the dense post - shock @xmath1wind ) .",
    "the gas velocities in these two regions , which are approximately equal to the terminal velocity of @xmath1 s wind , are consistent with the observed velocity of the p  cygni absorption in the lines ( @xmath81 to @xmath82  ) .",
    "which region dominates the absorption in line of sight is uncertain at this point , but the much denser ( by at least an order of magnitude ) wwir likely dominates , especially if one considers sight lines that are nearly parallel to and intersecting the wwir surface ( which is likely the case since the binary is inclined by @xmath83 away from the observer ; see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , contrary to the assumption by @xcite , the observed absorption is very likely dominated by material in the post - shock @xmath1wind , rather than in the pre - shock @xmath1wind .",
    "this is the scenario favoured by @xcite .",
    "another important difference between our simulation results and simpler models for @xmath0  car s he ionization zones ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the detailed ionization structure of the gas in the pre - shock @xmath1wind that borders the wwir .",

    "the region in the pre - shock @xmath1wind in our simulations is more similar to fig .",
    "5b of @xcite , but with the wings of not bending back farther than the location of @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite used their fig .  5 to illustrate their interpretation for why the strength of the p  cygni absorption observed in @xmath0  carhas been gradually increasing since 1998 , with a sudden absorption increase after the 2009 periastron event @xcite .",
    "@xcite attribute the observed increase in absorption , and other changes , to a gradual decrease of by a factor of @xmath223 between 1999 and 2010 .",

    "@xcite suggest that the enlarging of the zone in @xmath1 s pre - shock wind with decreasing would lead to more absorption in line of sight .",
    "our simplexsimulations show that , in the orbital plane , the behaviour of the ionization zone in @xmath1 s pre - shock wind with decreasing , as suggested by @xcite , is partially correct .",
    "we find that a decrease in does enlarge the zone in the pre - shock @xmath1wind .",
    "moving from case  a to case  b , two large ` wings ' of develop in the pre - shock @xmath1wind that bend backward around @xmath1 .",
    "the post - shock @xmath1wind also becomes more ionized and contains more out to larger radii from @xmath1 .",
    "however , the wings in the pre - shock @xmath1wind do not continuously border the wwir at all radii in case  b. near the outer edges of the simulation in the orbital plane , there are clear gaps between the pre - shock @xmath1   zone and the wwir . in these small regions ,",
    "he remains neutral .",
    "moreover , changes to the he ionization structure with decreasing are confined mostly to the orbital plane when moving from case  a to case  b. the case  b simulation shows that the ionization zone in the @xmath74 plane is much smaller and remains concentrated near the wwir apex , with no large wings extending back behind @xmath1 .",
    "decreasing even more from case  b to case  c results in @xmath3ionizing he throughout the entire simulation domain .",
    "as discussed above and in , such a low appears to be ruled out by numerous observations .    based on these results ,",
    "a small - to - moderate decrease ( by no more than a factor of 2 ) in , similar to the simple model suggested by @xcite , may help explain the observed increase in absorption .",
    "the key question is , how much emission and absorption does an ionization structure like that in case  b produce in line of sight ?",
    "one might expect such a large change in the zone within @xmath1 s pre - shock wind to result in a significant detectable change in the amounts of and emission .",
    "an increase in the amount of near the wwir that is available to be ionized by very soft x - rays generated in the post - shock @xmath1gas as it radiatively cools should lead to increased @xmath174686 emission throughout the binary orbit .",
    "significant changes in the amount of @xmath174686 emission during the broad part of @xmath0  car s orbit are not observed though , and the behaviour of the @xmath174686 emission during recent spectroscopic events has been amazingly similar ( teodoro et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the lack of any major changes in the observed @xmath174686 emission may imply that the amount of available in the pre - shock @xmath1wind at phases around apastron is not the key factor in determining the amount of @xmath174686 emission .",
    "rather , there may be a limited number of suitable photons generated in the wwir that can produce @xmath174686 emission in the available zone .",
    "as such , we suggest that the small amount of @xmath174686 emission that is observed across @xmath0  car s entire orbital cycle originates in the zone in @xmath1 s pre - shock wind that surrounds the apex of the wwir , with the high - energy photons required for such emission originating in the nearby post - shock @xmath1wind .    however , the above scenario does not remedy the problem of why there has been no observed increase in the amount of emission .",
    "if the efficiency for creating @xmath174686 emission around apastron is low , even though the amount of in @xmath1 s wind is high , one would expect increased emission .",
    "a possible explanation for the lack of increased emission is that the larger volume of ionized post - shock @xmath1wind is absorbing the photons generated in the larger pre - shock @xmath1   zone .",
    "the details of how the amounts of emission and absorption in line of sight change as the wwir opening angle increases ( due to the decreased and altered wind momentum ratio ) are poorly understood at this time , and it is unclear whether any decrease in was gradual ( between @xmath21998 and now ) or sudden ( during / after the 2009 periastron event ) .",
    "more detailed observations and theoretical models are needed to better understand the nature of @xmath0  car s lines .",
    "finally , based on our results , we speculate on a possible solution to an interesting problem concerning in @xmath0  car , namely , why there are no observed signatures of the broad emission lines in spectra obtained before 1944 if @xmath0  caris a binary containing a hot companion star ( for details , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is seen as a problem because it is assumed that @xmath3 , if it exists and is a hot , massive star , should always ionize a significant volume of @xmath1 s pre - shock stellar wind , leading to detectable emission .",
    "such emission is only marginally present ( at best ) in early spectra obtained between @xmath0  car s second eruption in the 1890s and 1944 .",
    "@xcite argue that , even if was larger in the past , @xmath3would still have ionized @xmath1 s pre - shock wind , which should lead to emission in the early spectra .    as shown in section  [ sec : results ] and discussed above , the results of detailed 3d hydrodynamical and rt simulations can differ substantially from the expectations of a simple model like that in fig .  12 of @xcite .",
    "our case  a simulations show that @xmath3 s -ionizing photons only moderately penetrate the dense post - shock @xmath1wind at radii @xmath475  au from the star , and that only the pre - shock wind in the inner @xmath275  au around the wwir apex is .",
    "we also see from our case  b and case  c results that a factor of 24 change in can lead to major changes in the ionization structure of he in @xmath1 s pre - shock wind . therefore , we suggest that the reason broad lines were not observed in spectra of @xmath0  carbefore 1944 is because was larger then ( by at least a factor of 24 , or more ) than it is now .",
    "while simplexresults using 3d sph simulations that employ a higher are needed to test this hypothesis , we can speculate what the resulting he - ionization structure would look like in such a situation where is roughly a factor of 2 or more larger than its present value .",
    "given the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : ion_he_xy ] and [ fig : ion_he_xz ] , the post - shock @xmath1wind was probably so dense it absorbed nearly all incoming -ionizing photons from @xmath3 , preventing ionization of the in @xmath1 s pre - shock wind .",
    "there was also probably much less in the post - shock @xmath1wind since any such that formed there would likely quickly recombine due to the extremely high densities in that region .",
    "there would moreover be little - to - no intrinsic emission from @xmath1itself , since the inner zone in its pre - shock wind would extend to @xmath86  2.5  au from the star . because the wind momentum ratio would be dominated by @xmath1 s much denser wind , the opening angle of the wwir",
    "would be much smaller , bringing the two arms of hot , post - shock @xmath3wind closer together .",
    "conceivably , the two arms could be so close they practically overlap , in which case the wind of @xmath3would be dominated by collisionally - ionized , with perhaps only a very narrow region of extending behind @xmath3(caused by photoionization of the remaining receding pre - shock wind ) . with practically no present in the inner @xmath0  carsystem , there would be no , or only marginal , emission detectable , thus explaining the early spectral observations .",
    "an enhanced between the 1890s and 1944 is quite possible , and even likely , since @xmath0  carhad just experienced its second eruption , wherein it ejected @xmath20.1  and formed the ` little homunculus ' @xcite .",
    "the dense , slow - moving near - equatorial circumstellar ejecta known as the weigelt blobs @xcite were also ejected around this time .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to suggest that the lbv primary had a larger mass - loss rate following these events , which slowly decreased to a more stable and ` normal ' value by @xmath21944 . during this period of higher , the ionizing flux from @xmath3was",
    "probably more confined and could not penetrate the denser wwir , leading to the absence of any significant emission .",
    "we investigated the effects of the hot secondary star s ionizing flux on @xmath0  car s inner winds and wwir , focusing on the ionization structure of helium during the spectroscopic high state ( i.e. orbital phases around apastron ) .",

    "results in density distributions in simplexthat are less affected by local differences in the sph particle distribution .",
