    "most parameter fitting studies assume that the spectrum of primordial cosmological perturbations is a fixed power of the co - moving wave - number @xmath3 over the range of scales being probed by observations . at most",
    ", a parameter describing a running of the spectrum is introduced . however , it is possible that the primordial spectrum has particular features which are poorly described assuming a slow running superimposed over a spectrum with fixed slope .",
    "in fact , it was found @xcite that making an ansatz for the spectrum which includes special features may improve the fit to the data .",
    "recently , it has been realized that the  matter bounce \" provides a possible alternative to cosmological inflation for providing a spectrum of scale - invariant adiabatic fluctuations on large scales .",
    "as realized in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , initial perturbations starting in their vacuum state and exiting the hubble radius in a matter - dominated phase of contraction lead to a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations on super - hubble scales in the contracting phase .",
    "if the contracting phase connects to an expanding phase via a non - singular bounce , then , as studied in @xcite in the context of the lee - wick bounce , a particular realization of a non - singular bounce , then the co - moving curvature fluctuations pass through the bounce without change in the spectral slope , as long as scales which are large compared to the duration of the bounce are considered ( see @xcite for other studies of this transfer of fluctuations reaching the same conclusion ) .    in a contracting universe ,",
    "the energy density of radiation increases faster than that of matter . hence",
    ", if the initial state contained both matter and radiation , it is inevitable that a change in the equation of state from matter to radiation will occur , very much like a transfer from radiation to matter occurs in the expanding branch . as we show in the following section , scales which exit the hubble radius in the radiation phase",
    "acquire an @xmath4 spectrum .",
    "if the cosmological bounce is close to time - symmetric , we should expect the break in the slope of the spectrum of primordial perturbations to occur on a cosmologically interesting scale , close to the scale which re - enters the hubble radius during the expanding phase at the time @xmath5 of equal matter and radiation .",
    "in this note we study the constraints which can be put from current observations on the transition scale where the spectral index changes from @xmath4 to @xmath6 .",
    "comparisons of a scale dependent primordial power spectrum with observational data can also been found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the outline of this note is as follows : in the following section we explain why in a matter bounce model a break in the spectrum from @xmath0 on large scales to @xmath4 on small scales will occur . in section 3",
    "we will discuss our method and the data used .",
    "our numerical results are presented in section 4 , and we end with a discussion .",
    "let us review the computation of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations on super - hubble scales starting from vacuum initial fluctuations on sub - hubble scales .",
    "we work in longitudinal gauge ( see e.g. @xcite for a detailed review of the theory of cosmological fluctuations and @xcite for a shorter overview ) in which the metric is given by ds^2 = a^2 ( ) , where @xmath7 is conformal time , the @xmath8 denote co - moving spatial coordinates and @xmath9 is the generalized gravitational potential which carries the information about the fluctuations . as long as we are far from the bounce time ,",
    "a good quantity to characterize the magnitude of the inhomogeneities is @xmath10 , the curvature fluctuation in co - moving coordinates which is expressed in terms of @xmath11 via = ( ^ + ) + , @xmath12 denoting the hubble expansion rate in conformal time , a prime indicating the derivative with respect of @xmath7 , and @xmath13 being the equation of state parameter ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 are pressure and energy density , respectively ) .",
    "the variable @xmath10 is closely related to the variable @xmath16 @xcite in terms of which the action for cosmological fluctuations has canonical kinetic term : [ rel ] = , where @xmath17 is a function of the cosmological background . if matter is modeled as a scalar field @xmath18 , then z = a .",
    "if the equation of state is not changing , then @xmath19 .",
    "vacuum initial conditions on sub - hubble scales hence imply that on such scales [ vac ] v(k , t ) = .",
    "the equation of motion for the fourier mode @xmath20 of @xmath16 is v_k^  + ( k^2 - ) v_k = 0 . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath16 is oscillating on sub - hubble scales , whereas on super - hubble scales the evolution of @xmath16 is determined by the function @xmath21 .",
    "if the background scale factor evolves as a(t ) ~ t^p , then the super - hubble solutions scale as [ scaling ] v ( ) ~ ^ with [ alpha ] = , = . in the matter phase",
    "we have @xmath22 and hence @xmath23 which leads to the two values for @xmath2 which are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the second mode is growing in the contracting phase . making use of vacuum initial conditions ( [ vac ] ) at hubble radius crossing",
    ", we obtain a scale - invariant power spectrum on super - hubble scales [ powerm ] p_(k , ) & ~ & k^3 |_k()|^2 ~ k^3 |v_k()|^2 + & ~ & k^3 |v_k(_h(k))|^2 _",
    "~ const , where the first step is the definition of the power spectrum , the second step uses ( [ rel ] ) , the third the temporal scaling ( [ scaling ] ) of the dominant mode , and in the final step we have inserted the vacuum initial conditions ( [ vac ] ) , the hubble crossing relation @xmath26 and the scaling of the scale factor as a function of conformal time ( see also @xcite where the calculation was done following the evolution of @xmath11 from initial hubble radius crossing in the contracting phase until the post - bounce expanding phase ) .    in the radiation phase ( see @xcite for an earlier analysis of the evolution of fluctuations in a contracting radiation phase ) we have @xmath27 and hence @xmath28 which leads to the two values for @xmath2 which are @xmath29 and @xmath30 . hence v_k ( ) = c_1 + c_2 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constants .",
    "thus , the dominant mode of @xmath16 is constant on super - hubble scales ( the corresponding mode of @xmath10 is growing ) . a calculation analogous to ( [ powerm ] ) yields [ powerr ] p_(k , ) & ~ & k^3    & ~ & k^3 |v_k(_h(k))|^2 ~ k^2 , where we have used the constancy of @xmath16 on super - hubble scales and the vacuum initial conditions .",
    "this is an @xmath33 spectrum .    to summarize this section ,",
    "we have shown that inhomogeneities originating as quantum vacuum perturbations on sub - hubble scales and crossing the hubble radius in a matter - dominated contracting phase obtain a scale - invariant @xmath34 spectrum , whereas those exiting the hubble radius during a radiation - dominated contracting phase get an @xmath33 spectrum .",
    "if our universe has emerged from a time - symmetric bounce , we would expect all scales which enter the hubble radius after the time @xmath5 of equal matter and radiation to have a scale - invariant spectrum , whereas those re - entering earlier would have an @xmath33 spectrum .",
    "if the bounce is asymmetric because of the production of radiation around the bounce point , we would expect that the transition scale is somewhat smaller than the scale which re - enters the hubble radius at @xmath5 . in the following",
    ", we will study what constraints which current data can give on the scale at which the break in the index of the power spectrum occurs .",
    "in our study , we perform a global analysis using the publicly available mcmc package cosmomc @xcite .",
    "our theory input is as follows : we assume purely adiabatic initial conditions .",
    "our theory parameter space vector is : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in which @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities relative to the critical density , @xmath40 is the ratio ( multiplied by 100 ) of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath41 is the optical depth to re - ionization .",
    "the remaining parameters are related to the primordial scalar power spectrum @xmath42 which is parameterized as @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined as the amplitudes of initial power spectrum before and after the step , @xmath46 and @xmath47 measure the spectral index before and after the step in the power spectrum , a step which is located at the co - moving wavenumber @xmath48 , and we match the power spectrum at @xmath48 during the numerical calculation in order to guarantee the continuity of the power spectrum . for the pivot scale",
    "we set @xmath49mpc@xmath50 .",
    "we assume that the universe is spatially flat and work in the context of the @xmath51cdm framework with equation of state @xmath52 for the dark energy component .    in our calculations",
    ", we have taken the total likelihood to be the products of the separate likelihoods of cmb , snia , lss and lya . alternatively defining @xmath53",
    ", we get ^2_total = ^2_cmb+ ^2_snia+^2_lss+^2_lya   .using a markov chain monte carlo routine the package then determines the best fit theory parameter values and the corresponding statistical error bars .",
    "the data sets we have used are the following : in terms of cmb data , we have included in our parameter fitting the wmap5 temperature and polarization power spectra with the routine for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team .",
    "we also included some small - scale cmb measurements , such as boomerang @xcite , cbi @xcite , vsa @xcite and the newly released acbar data @xcite . besides the cmb information , we also combine information about the matter power spectrum from the  luminous red galaxies \" sample from the sloan digital sky survey@xcite and supernova snia data . in the calculation of the likelihood from snia we have marginalized over the  nuisance parameter",
    "the supernova data we use is the  union \" compilation ( 307 sample ) @xcite .",
    "we also consider small scale information obtained from the lyman-@xmath2 forest power spectrum from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , however we also keep its unclear systematics in mind @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we make use of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) measurement of the hubble parameter @xmath54h  km  s@xmath50  mpc@xmath50 by using a gaussian likelihood function centered around @xmath55 with standard deviation @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "in this section we show the results from the global fitting to the observational data .",
    "we focus on @xmath48 , the scale at which the break in the power spectrum occurs , and @xmath57 , the power index parameters , and we marginalize over the other cosmological parameters .",
    "the numerical results are listed in tables i. we give the results obtained in two different calculations : in one we keep free the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath48 and fix @xmath58 , in the other we keep @xmath46 , @xmath48 and @xmath47 all to be free parameters .",
    "table i. constraints on the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath48 from cmb , lss , sne with / without lyman @xmath2 data . we have considered two cases : either fixing @xmath59 or keeping @xmath47 free .",
    "the results are obtained by marginalizing over the other theory parameters .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the one dimensional probability distribution of @xmath48 obtained by fitting with observational data . in this calculation , we have fixed the second power index to be @xmath58 and let the first index @xmath46 as well as @xmath48 be free .",
    "the black solid line is obtained if we only use the cmb , lss and sn ia data , the red dashed line results by including in addition the lyman @xmath2 data .",
    "the probability distribution is obtained by marginalizing over the other cosmological parameters .",
    "we find that with current data we can obtain a limit on @xmath48 .",
    "since the data ( in particular the lyman @xmath2 data ) tends to indicate that there is slightly less structure on small scales than a scale - invariant primordial power spectrum would predict , and the matter bounce model predicts more power on small scales than is obtained from a scale - invariant spectrum , we get a lower bound on the k - value of the break point . from cmb , lss and sn data alone , we get @xmath60 at @xmath61 . taking into account the lyman @xmath2 data ,",
    "the limit on @xmath48 can be pushed to a much smaller length scale : the @xmath62 limits can be pushed to @xmath63 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the results obtained by keeping both @xmath47 and @xmath48 free .",
    "we find there are only weak constraints on @xmath47 .",
    "the data mildly prefers a red rather than a blue tilt ( such as the  matter bounce \" would predict ) , and prefers the position of the break in the power spectrum to be at the value @xmath64 .",
    "the interpretation of this result is that a primordial spectrum which is almost scale - invariant , characterized by a fixed power index @xmath46 , fits the large - scale structure data well , but that there is less structure on scales below the break point .     from the observations , assuming a spatially flat universe .",
    "the vertical axis is the probability , the horizontal axis co - moving scale .",
    "the black solid line shows the probability distribution for the position @xmath65 of the break in the spectrum obtained using the cmb @xmath66 lss @xmath66 sn ia data .",
    "the red dashed line is obtained by additionally taking into account the lya data.[fig1 ] ]     and the second power index @xmath47 from cmb @xmath66 lss @xmath66 sn ia @xmath66 lya data .",
    "there are theoretical models such as the  matter bounce \" which predict a transition in the power spectrum from being approximately scale - invariant on length scales larger than some distinguished scale to being approximately scaling as @xmath33 in shorter length scales . in this note",
    ", we have studied the constraints on the value of @xmath67 , the co - moving momentum at which the break occurs .",
