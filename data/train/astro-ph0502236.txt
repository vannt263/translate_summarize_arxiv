    "one of the most debated issue of modern astrophysics is the definition of the local distance scale and of the distance of its first step , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , in particular . indeed , current calibrations of the extragalactic distance scale and consequent evaluations of the hubble constant rely upon the classical cepheid pl relations with the zero point fixed by some assumption on the lmc distance ( see e.g. freedman et al .",
    "2001 , tammann , sandage , & reindl 2003 ) .",
    "recent determinations of the lmc distance modulus , either based on population i or ii distance indicators , cover the range 18.3 - 18.7 mag ( see discussions in cacciari 1999 , walker 1999 , carretta et al .",
    "2000 , caputo et al .",
    "however , in the last couple of years different distance indicators have followed the trend to converge to a common value of @xmath5=18.52 @xmath3 0.02 mag , on the basis of updated accurate photometric data for both rr lyrae and red clump stars , as well as revised techniques and consistent reddening evaluations ( see discussions in clementini et al . 2003 , hereinafter c03 , walker 2003 , and alves 2004 ) .    among the different methods exploiting the radially pulsating stars as standard",
    "candles a quite innovative and promising technique is represented by the fitting of the observed light and radial velocity curves of a pulsating star to those predicted by nonlinear pulsation models ( see e.g. wood , arnold & sebo 1997 , hereinafter was ; keller & wood 2002 ; bono , castellani , & marconi 2000 , 2002 , hereinafter bcm00 and bcm02 , respectively ; di fabrizio et al .",
    "this technique is based on the direct comparison between observed and predicted curves , rather than involving related parameters such as pulsation amplitudes and fourier parameters , and performs the theoretical reproduction of both general features ( period , shape , amplitude ) and morphological details such as bumps and humps , of the observed curves .",
    "given the sensitivity of the curve detailed morphology to the model input parameters , as well as to the physical and numerical assumptions , the fitting of actual light and radial velocity curves offers a unique opportunity to obtain sound estimates of the intrinsic stellar properties of the variables , providing at the same time a key test of the theoretical predictions .",
    "high accuracy observational data , consisting of well sampled multiband light and , possibly , radial velocity curves , knowledge of the related pulsation characteristics , namely period , colors and amplitudes , and of the metallicity of the variable star , are needed for a meaningful application of the method .",
    "the output of the procedure is a set of models for fixed period and metal abundance and with varying the mass , the luminosity and the effective temperature , among which the best fitting model is that best reproducing the observed characteristics of the pulsation , within acceptable values of the derived intrinsic parameters .    in the case of variables of rr lyrae type",
    "this technique has already provided very good results for galactic field first overtone rr lyrae stars ( see bcm00 , di fabrizio et al .",
    "2002 ) , whereas for the fundamental mode pulsators satisfactory results were obtained except for the long period variables close to the red edge of the rr lyrae instability strip ( see castellani , deglinnocenti , & marconi 2002 , di criscienzo , marconi , & caputo 2004 ) .    as for the classical cepheids a similar technique was early applied by",
    "was to the lmc bump cepheid hv905 .",
    "more recently , relying on the same theoretical pulsational scenario as in bcm00 , the method was applied to two lmc fundamental mode cepheids showing well - defined bumps along the decreasing ( short - period ) and the rising ( long - period ) branch of the light curve , respectively ( bcm02 ) , based on data from the ogle catalogue ( available at sirius.astrouw.edu.pol/@xmath6ogle/ogle2/dia ) .",
    "a good fit was obtained for both variables and for an lmc distance modulus ranging from 18.48 to 18.58 mag ( see bcm02 for details ) , in agreement with results by c03 . an independent application to the macho @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath8 light curves of 20 _ bump _ cepheids in the lmc ( including hv905 ) was performed by keller & wood ( 2002 ) , on the basis of the was nonlinear pulsation code .",
    "they obtained a mean lmc distance modulus of 18.55 @xmath3 0.02 ( intrinsic error of the average ) .",
    "both in the case of rr lyrae stars and classical cepheids the best fit models based on bcm00 theoretical scenario seem to suggest that the standard value of the mixing length parameter ( @xmath9 ) adopted to close the dynamical - convective equation system is suitable to reproduce the light variations of variables in the blue region of the instability strip . a higher value of @xmath10 is needed instead toward the red region of the fundamental mode instability strip ( see e.g. bcm02 ) .",
    "this occurrence is confirmed by results based on other independent `` pulsational '' methods to constrain the rr lyrae and globular cluster distance scale , in particular the period - amplitude relations and the comparison in the period - magnitude diagram ( see di criscienzo et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in this paper we present results from the theoretical modelling of the observed @xmath0 light curves of 14 rr lyrae stars in the lmc , based on the detailed photometric study of the lmc rr lyrae stars by c03 and di fabrizio et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereinafter df04 ) .",
    "our sample includes 7 fundamental mode ( rrab ) and 7 first overtone ( rrc ) pulsators that , according to gratton et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereinafter g04 ) spectroscopic analysis , cover the metallicity range from @xmath12.12 to @xmath10.79 in [ fe / h ] , with average value of @xmath11.54 dex .",
    "the application of the method to a significant number of population ii pulsators in the same stellar system , namely the lmc rr lyrae stars , represents a powerful test of the inner consistency and predictive capability of the adopted theoretical scenario , providing at the same time an independent estimate of the lmc distance modulus , and a direct comparison between population i and ii distance indicators , which contributes to strengthen our knowledge of the local distance scale .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in sect .",
    "2 we briefly discuss the adopted photometric ( light curves and reddening values ) and spectroscopic ( metallicities ) databases . in sect .",
    "3 we present the pulsation models , whereas the fit of the observed light curves and the derivation of the intrinsic stellar parameters ( masses , luminosities , and effective temperatures ) both for fundamental and first overtone pulsators is described in sect .",
    "4 . in this section",
    "we also discuss the comparison with the intrinsic parameters predicted for the program stars by the evolutionary horizontal branch ( hb ) models , and by the fourier decomposition of the visual light curves of the fundamental mode rr lyrae stars .",
    "the derived lmc distance modulus and the associated uncertainty are presented in sect . 5 along with a discussion of the resulting rr lyrae luminosity - metallicity relation . a summary of the results and some final remarks in section 6 close the paper .",
    "the rr lyrae stars analyzed in the present paper were selected from the high quality photometric catalogue of variable stars in the lmc published by df04 .",
    "the catalogue contains @xmath11 light curves in the johnson - cousins photometric system of 162 variables located in two areas ( referred to as field a and b ) close to the bar of the lmc , among which 135 are rr lyrae stars .",
    "these variables were used by c03 to very carefully determine the distance of the lmc , getting the value @xmath12=18.515 @xmath3 0.085 mag ( 1 @xmath4 scatter of the mean ) as the average of 17 independent methods based both on population i and ii distance indicators . a large fraction of the rr lyrae stars in df04 were also analyzed spectroscopically by g04 who measured individual metal abundances for about a hundred of them , using low resolution spectra taken with fors at the vlt .    the target stars were selected by visual inspection of df04 catalogue , preferring objects with well sampled and accurate light curves , and variety of morphologies , periodicities , and colors .",
    "we chose for our analysis a number of single - mode fundamental and first overtone pulsators not affected by blazhko effect ( blazhko 1907 ) or other irregularities of the light variations .",
    "the selected objects all have evenly covered @xmath0 light curves with about 60 - 70 data points in @xmath7 and about 40 in @xmath13 , and with internal photometric accuracy of 0.02 - 0.04 mag in @xmath7 and 0.03 - 0.05 mag in @xmath13 , according to df04 .",
    "the @xmath14 light curves in df04 catalogue are generally of lower accuracy and have a rather limited number of data - points ( 14 - 15 ) , thus we did not attempt the fit in this band .    to ensure variety of the light curve morphologies we selected objects spanning a range in period : from 0.487 to 0.656 days for the fundamental mode , and from 0.232 to 0.385 days for the first overtone pulsators .",
    "metallicities [ fe / h ] are available for all our targets , either from the spectroscopic analysis by g04 , or estimated according to jurcsik and kovcs ( 1996 ) method from the @xmath15 parameter of the fourier decomposition of the visual light curves ( see sections 6 and 6.1 of df04 ) .",
    "g04 spectroscopic metal abundances are tied to the metallicity scale defined by harris ( 1996 ) [ fe / h ] abundance for the galactic globular clusters m  68 and ngc  1851 ( see section 4 in g04 ) , on average they are 0.06 more metal - rich than the zinn & west ( 1984 ) scale .",
    "photometric \" metallicities ( star # 9660 , only ) were transformed to g04 scale according to the procedure described in section 3.3 of c03 .",
    "the metallicity range spanned by the selected targets ( from @xmath12.12 to @xmath10.79 dex in [ fe / h ] in g04 scale ) is large enough to allow the check of the luminosity - metallicity relation of the lmc rr lyrae derived by other studies ( e.g. c03 and g04 ) using the absolute magnitudes derived from the model fitting ( see section 5.1 ) .    following the selection criteria described above , we ended up having in our sample a number of rrab s with relatively long period ( @xmath16 days ) .",
    "one of them ( star # 9660 ) also has relatively high metal abundance ( [ fe / h]=@xmath11.5 ) and , as confirmed by its rather red color ( @xmath17=0.47 mag ) , lies close to the red edge of the rr lyrae instability strip0.51 mag . ] .",
    "this is the object for which we have achieved the least satisfying model fitting ( see section 4 and fig .",
    "1 ) . indeed , as anticipated in the introduction , current pulsation models often fail to reproduce the morphology of the light curves of long period fundamental mode rr lyrae stars close to the fre .",
    "in fact , while the theoretical light curves are generally able to reproduce the saw - like shape with amplitude decreasing from the fbe to the fre of the observed fundamental mode rr lyrae stars , at the lowest effective temperatures the models also show a secondary peak before the phase of maximum light .",
    "this secondary peak is of increasing strength as the fre is being approached .",
    "however , it is not present in the observed light curves .",
    "c03 estimated the average reddening of the lmc fields containing our targets using the colors of the edges of the rr lyrae instability strip .",
    "they derived @xmath18=0.116@xmath30.017 for the field closer to the lmc bar ( field a ) , and @xmath18=0.086@xmath30.017 mag for the more external one ( field b ) , corresponding to a differential reddening of 0.03 mag between the two areas .",
    "our rrc sample includes two of the 3 variables that define the first overtone blue edge ( fobe ) of the rr lyrae stars in c03 and df04 .",
    "c03 also estimated individual reddenings for the rrab variables using the sturch ( 1966 ) method , which is based on the mean @xmath17 colors at minimum light of the variables .",
    "the color excesses inferred from our model fitting procedure can be directly compared with both average and individual reddenings in c03 , thus providing an independent check of c03 values , hence of the distance for the lmc in that paper .",
    "this check is particularly relevant in light of the controversy existing on the actual reddening towards the lmc ( see discussions in udalski et al . 1999 , hereinafter u99 ; zaritsky 1999 ; c03 ; alcock et al .",

    "in the last few years an extensive and detailed set of updated nonlinear convective pulsation models of rr lyrae stars has been developed covering wide ranges in period and metal abundances ( see bono et al .",
    "2003 , marconi et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the physical and numerical assumptions adopted in the theoretical computations were widely discussed in these papers , to which the interested reader is referred for details .",
    "we only remark here that thanks to the nonlinearity and the inclusion of convective transfer in a non local , time - dependent approach ( see stellingwerf 1982 , bono & stellingwerf 1994 for details ) current models are able to reproduce all the relevant pulsational observables , namely periods , amplitudes and the complete topology of the instability strip , where the blue boundaries for fundamental and first overtone modes are connected to the position of the h and he ionization regions within the pulsating envelope , whereas the red boundaries are due to the quenching produced by convection , as well as the variations of the relevant quantities ( namely luminosity and radial velocity ) along the pulsation cycle .",
    "the capability to reproduce light and radial velocity curves allows to directly compare observed and predicted variations .",
    "we also remind that , as discussed in bcm00 , in order to properly reproduce all the morphological features exhibited by the first overtone curves , one needs models constructed by assuming a vanishing overshooting efficiency in the regions where the superadiabatic gradient attains negative values .",
    "all the models adopted in the present investigation are computed with this assumption on the treatment of turbulent convection and include an updated input physics ( see bcm00 for details ) .",
    "in order to reproduce the observed light curves of the selected rr lyrae stars we adopted as input parameters the metal abundances and the periods reported in table [ t : table1 ] , and for each pulsator we computed isoperiodic model sequences ( corresponding to the observed periodicity ) for the global metal abundance @xmath21 inferred from the empirical @xmath22 $ ] value.-1.7 $ ] , neglecting the possible occurrence of @xmath23 enhancement phenomena ] then for each model the theoretical @xmath24 _ versus _ phase curve was overimposed to the data , and shifted vertically in magnitude to match the observed behaviour , by allowing at the same time the model input z to vary within the ranges permitted by the empirical determination .",
    "the necessary magnitude shift provides a direct evaluation of the apparent distance modulus of the selected objects .",
    "although the best fit solution is searched over a wide range of stellar parameters , the stellar masses were selected in order to cover at least the evolutionary predictions for hb stars of the corresponding metal abundances ( see e.g. cassisi et al .",

    "adopted stellar mass , the model luminosity and effective temperature were then varied in order to simultaneously reproduce the period and the light curve morphology in the @xmath7 band . to this purpose , for each model , the predicted bolometric light curve was converted into the @xmath0 bands adopting the model atmospheres by castelli , gratton & kurucz ( 1997a , b ) . when needed , the standard mixing length value ( @xmath9 )",
    "was increased up to @xmath25 , again in the range of the values adopted in current evolutionary computations .",

    "we find that models that best reproduce the @xmath7 band light curves also show a good agreement with observations in the @xmath13 band .",
    "we also found that models corresponding to the spectroscopic metallicities ( transformed to z values ) were generally able to best fit the observed light variations . only in the case of stars",
    "# 5902 and # 2517 we had to respectively decrease and increase the input empirical metallicity to achieve a good reproduction of the observed light curves . however , these variations were always within the range allowed by the errors of the spectroscopic determinations .",
    "the inferred apparent @xmath7 and @xmath13 distance moduli , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and their related uncertainties are reported in columns 9 and 10 of table [ t : table2 ] , whereas the _ pulsational _ color excess @xmath18 derived from the difference @xmath28 is given in column 11 .",
    "true individual @xmath7 distance moduli @xmath29 evaluated from the @xmath26 values in column 9 of table  [ t : table2 ] and the adopted reddening values ( see section 4.4 ) assuming a standard extinction law @xmath30 , are given in column 12 .",
    "finally , in column 13 we provide the absolute visual magnitudes derived from the model fitting , that is the intensity - averaged mean absolute magnitudes obtained from the best fit model curves in the @xmath7 band .",
    "we note that , since these absolute magnitudes are intrinsic properties of the models , they only depend on the accuracy of the model fitting and of the observed curves , but are completely independent of our knowledge of the variable star reddening and distance . as shown in figs . 1 and 2 , models are not able to completely reproduce the rising branch of some of the fundamental mode pulsators .",
    "this is particularly true for the coolest pulsator in our sample , namely variable star v9660 for which the appearance in the model light curve of a _ hump _ before the maximum light , changes the slope of the rising branch and causes a delay of the phase of maximum itself .",
    "a similar effect is also present , although at lower extent , in the fitting of v2249 and v2525 .",
    "analogous problems were found by castellani et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to fit with current pulsation models the fundamental mode rr lyrae stars at the fre in the globular cluster @xmath31 cen .    as for the first overtone pulsators ,",
    "the light curves are found to become close to pure sinusoids as the fobe is approached ( see the case of variable v2119).this behaviour holds for all the explored stellar masses and luminosity levels and might suggest the occurrence of some kind of degeneracy of the solution and the need for fixing a m - l relation .",
    "however , since the range of effective temperature covered by almost pure sinusoidal light curves is quite narrow ( 100 - 150 k ) at each luminosity level , by selecting the stellar mass in the range of the evolutionary predictions for the adopted metal abundance , the best fit mass and luminosity are constrained by the observed period and amplitude .",
    "we note , however , that the very short period , the low apparent luminosity , and the _ sinusoidal _ light curve of variable v2517 could also make it consistent with a fundamental mode @xmath32 scuti model ( with stellar mass in the range 1.5 - 2.0 @xmath33 ) , according to the predictions by bono et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "finally , we point out that the mixing length parameter adopted to fit the observed light curves has the standard value @xmath34 for all the first overtone pulsators , whereas it ranges from 1.85 to 2.2 for the fundamental mode variables , again in agreement with previous results from the model fitting technique .      in order to evaluate the uncertainties associated to the fitting procedure and their impact on the inferred intrinsic quantities , we have computed additional model sequences for a subsample of fundamental and first overtone pulsators , by varying the stellar parameters around the best fit values . as a result of this procedure we find mean uncertainties of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "these uncertainties contribute an error of @xmath6 0.05 mag in the derived apparent distance moduli @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "final errors on @xmath26 and @xmath27 should also include the contributions due to the photometric uncertainties of the observed light curves .",
    "these are provided in columns 5 and 8 of table  [ t : table1 ] , and once added in quadrature to the 0.05 mag uncertainty of the fitting procedure lead to the total errors associated to the individual @xmath26 , @xmath27 values in columns 9 and 10 of table  [ t : table2 ] .",
    "we are aware that the present results hold in the context of the adopted theoretical scenario , namely bono et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and marconi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) pulsation models .",
    "however , we note that bono , marconi & stellingwerf ( 1999 ) performed a direct comparison with was pulsation models . by adopting the same input parameters of was for constructing the light curve of the bump cepheid hv905",
    ", they found that predictions by the two hydrocodes , although based on different physical assumptions concerning the input physics and the pulsation / convection interaction , are in reasonable agreement .",
    "errors on the _ pulsational _ color excess e(b - v ) in table  [ t : table2 ] are computed as the propagation of uncertainties in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 values ( columns 9 and 10 of table  [ t : table2 ] ) .",
    "admittedly , they are rather large .",
    "still the _ pulsational _ reddenings derived for these lmc variables are very reasonable values , and agree well with estimates from other more robust methods ( e.g. c03 , see section 4.4 ) , thus providing anyway a sanity check both of other reddening determinations and of the reliability of our model fitting procedure .    finally , errors on the true @xmath7 distance moduli @xmath29 are the sum in quadrature of 3.1 times the uncertainty in the adopted reddenings ( see section 4.4 ) and of the errors in the apparent @xmath26 s in column 9 of table  [ t : table2 ]",
    ". uncertainties in the @xmath24 s instead only depend on the uncertainty of the best fitting procedure ( 0.05 mag ) , and on the photometric uncertainties of the observed @xmath7 light curves ( column 5 of table  [ t : table1 ] ) .",
    "we explicitly note that the smaller errors of the @xmath24 values derived from the model fitting compared to the errors of the @xmath29 values reflect the strength of a technique which allows to directly estimate the intrinsic quantity , namely the absolute magnitude of the variable star , without relying upon the knowledge of the reddening , by far one of the most uncertain and controversial quantities in the lmc .",
    "stellar masses and luminosities derived from the model fitting are generally consistent , within the uncertainties on the model fitting quoted in sect .",
    "4.1 , with the values predicted by stellar evolution models of the proper metal abundances .",

    "( 1998 ) , and finally vandenberg et al .",
    "the comparison among estimates given by different authors helps us to quantify the uncertainty of current evolutionary predictions . for some of the variables we find that the pulsation model fitting provides significantly smaller masses and/or higher luminosity levels than all the considered zahb models , thus suggesting possible evolutionary effects",
    "this is indeed the case for the metal - poor variable stars v5902 , v7620 , v7477 , v2024 , and for the metal - intermediate stars v2249 , v4179 and v27697 .",
    "for the relatively metal - rich variable 2517 our pulsational luminosity is slightly fainter than the evolutionary predictions , but consistent with catelan et al .",
    "estimate , within the error .",
    "moreover , as already mentioned , the model metallicity for this star was slightly increased with respect to the spectroscopic value , within the empirical uncertainty .",
    "indeed , a best fit solution was also found for the mean spectroscopic value ( z=0.002 ) , however in this case the intrinsic model parameters were not in agreement with the evolutionary predictions . finally , as noticed in sect .",
    "4 , this star , given the very short period and low apparent luminosity , could also be consistent with a relatively massive fundamental mode @xmath32 scuti pulsator .      in table",
    "[ t : table4 ] we have summarized masses , luminosities , effective temperatures , and absolute magnitudes derived from the present study and , for comparison , the same quantities as estimated by df04 from the fourier parameters of the visual light curves for the variables in the present sample for which this analysis was possible , namely 5 rrab s that satisfy jurcsik & kovcs ( 1996 ) _ compatibility conditions _",
    "( see details in section 6 of df04 ) .",
    "we note that while masses estimated from the two methods agree within a few hundreds , luminosities and effective temperatures from the model fitting are on average systematically larger , respectively by 0.07 dex and 200 k , than the corresponding quantities from the fourier analysis .",
    "these systematic effects seem to suggest the occurrence of problems with the calibration of fourier parameters , making them still not reliable ( see also the discussion in cacciari et al .",
    "2004 ) .    moreover , the absolute magnitudes from the model fitting span an interval about 0.13 mag larger than those from the fourier parameters , a similar result was also found by df04 .",
    "the amount of reddening affecting the lmc still remains poorly known since estimates by different techniques and authors have often provided controversial results that do not agree to each other ( see u99 , zaritsky 1999 , c03 , a04 , zaritsky et al .",
    "the lmc color excess is also found to vary by large amounts from one region of the galaxy to the other , thus requiring local estimates that are to be preferred to the use of average values over large areas .",

    "[ t : table5 ] the _ pulsational _ reddenings derived from the model fittings are compared with estimates obtained for the same stars or lmc regions by c03 , u99 , and a04 using different techniques . in particular , reddenings labelled `` strip '' ( see column 4 of table  [ t : table5 ] ) were obtained by c03 from the comparison of the colors of the edges of the rr lyrae instability strip defined by the variables contained in the two lmc fields they observed , with those of the low reddening globular cluster m3 .",
    "they determined two distinct values , that apply to the variables contained in each given field , separately .",
    "reddenings labelled `` sturch '' ( see column 5 of table  [ t : table5 ] ) are `` individual '' estimates derived by c03 using sturch ( 1966 ) method , which is based on the color at minimum light of the fundamental mode rr lyrae stars .",
    "u99 is the average reddening measured from variations in the @xmath14 luminosity of clump stars located in ogle - ii field lmc_sc21 .",
    "this field partially overlaps to c03 field a , and according to table  14 of df04 , two of the variable stars analyzed here ( namely the rrc stars # 2119 and # 27697 ) fall into the common region .    finally , a04 is the mean color excess estimated from 330 first overtone rr lyrae stars spread over 16 macho fields close to the lmc bar .",
    "we only have the rrc star # 8837 in common with a04 sample ( see table  12 in that paper ) .",
    "as discussed in section  4 , notwithstanding their large uncertainties , the _ pulsational _ reddenings provide a consistency check of the color excesses derived by other techniques . in this respect",
    "we note that they agree well with the empirical values by c03 while , on average , are about 0.02 - 0.03 mag smaller than u99 and a04 estimates . however , this systematic difference is not surprising given the rather clumpy reddening of the lmc , the larger areas covered by the reddening indicators used in both u99 and a04 , and their locations on or closer to the lmc bar than in c03 .    in the following",
    "we will adopt for each of our targets the weighted average of the _ pulsational _ , c03-strip , and c03-sturch reddenings ( values in columns 3,4 and 5 of table  [ t : table5 ] ) .",
    "these average values are provided in column 8 with their related uncertainties that are simply the standard deviations of the weighted means .",
    "they will be used together with the apparent distance moduli @xmath26 in table  [ t : table2 ] to derive true distance moduli @xmath29 for each of our targets ( see section 5 ) .",
    "true distance moduli @xmath29 for our program stars were computed from the apparent moduli in column 9 of table  [ t : table2 ] and the reddenings in column 8 of table  [ t : table5 ] using the standard extinction law ( @xmath38=3.1@xmath39 ) .",
    "they are provided in column 12 of table  [ t : table2 ] .",
    "errors in these @xmath29 values are the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties in the apparent distance moduli @xmath26 and 3.1 times the uncertainty of the reddenings . by performing a weighted mean of these @xmath29 values",
    "we obtain a final estimate for the true distance modulus of the lmc of @xmath40= 18.54 @xmath3 0.02 ( @xmath4=0.09 , standard deviation about the average of the 14 rr lyrae stars ) .",
    "the 0.09 mag dispersion of this average value is fully accounted for by uncertainties in the reddening and model fitting technique , implying that the distance moduli derived for individual objects are consistent within the respective error bars .",
    "the derived lmc average distance modulus is well in the range of the most recent evaluations in the literature that all prefer the _ long _ distance scale ( see walker 2003 , c03 , alves 2004 , and reference therein ) , agrees well with the results of the light curve fitting of two classical cepheids in the lmc by bcm02 , and is in excellent agreement with keller & wood ( 2002 ) lmc distance modulus from the model fitting of 20 lmc _ bump _ cepheids .",
    "this excellent agreement between population i and ii distance indicators in the lmc is very rewarding in light of the longstanding controversy existing in the past on the distance to the lmc based on these two independent indicators .",
    "moreover the agreement with keller & wood determination , which is based on a different pulsation code and relies on different physical and numerical assumptions , supports the soundness and reliability of our results .",
    "we also point out that a different choice for the reddening , namely adoption of u99 and a04 average values ( @xmath18=0.142 mag ) would give @xmath40=18.46@xmath41 , again in the range of the `` long '' scale and at odds with methods favoring much shorter distance moduli ( in the range from @xmath618.2 to @xmath618.3 mag ) for the lmc ( e.g. fernley et al .",

    "hb and rr lyrae stars are known to follow a luminosity - metallicity relation generally considered to be of linear form .",
    "the slope of this relation is still matter of debate with values in the range from 0.30 ( sandage 1993 ) to 0.18 - 0.20 mag / dex ( caloi et al .",
    "1997 , cassisi et al .",
    "1998 , fernley et al .",
    "1998b , c03 , g04 , rich et al .",
    "2001 , 2005 ) .",
    "there are also empirical and theoretical evidences for a non - linearity of the relation followed by the galactic globular clusters ( caputo et al .",
    "2000 , rey et al .",
    "2000 ) , however there is no clear proof of such a non - linearity in the behaviour of the galactic ( fernley et al .",
    "1998b ) and lmc ( c03 , g04 ) field rr lyrae stars , as well as in the m31 globular clusters ( rich et al .",
    "2001 , 2005 ) . at fixed metal abundance",
    "there is also an intrinsic spread in the hb luminosity , due to evolutionary effects , ( see e.g. sandage 1990 ) .",
    "such evolutionary effects are also predicted by evolutionary and synthetic horizontal branch computations ( see e.g. lee , demarque & zinn 1990 , caputo et al . 1993 , caloi et al . 1997 , cassisi et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) . a fairly large number of objects should be considered in order to reduce the impact of the evolutionary effects , since evolution off the zahb can affect the slope of the luminosity - metallicity relation .",
    "c03 and g04 have recently derived the slope of the luminosity - metallicity of the lmc rr lyrae stars using a fairly significant large sample of variables ( 98 stars ) based on their homogeneous and accurate photometric and spectroscopic datasets for these stars . since rr lyrae stars in the lmc",
    "can in the first approximation all be considered at the same distance from us , c03 and g04 used directly the dereddened apparent visual magnitudes of the variables without any assumption on their absolute magnitudes , that might be affected by problems of zero point in the distance scale .",
    "further advantages of c03 and g04 approach were the significant statistics of their sample , and the large number of objects at intermediate metal abundance : the metal distribution of c03 and g04 sample peaks at [ fe / h]=@xmath11.48 dex , with the bulk of stars ( 66 objects ) in the metallicity bin @xmath42[fe / h]@xmath431.3 .",
    "both these characteristics allow minimization of the effects on the slope of the intrinsic spread in luminosity of the rr lyrae stars due to their evolution off the zahb .",
    "they derived a rather mild slope of 0.214 @xmath3 0.047 mag / dex in agreement with results from the baade - wesselink method of 28 galactic field rr lyrae stars ( @xmath44$]=0.20 @xmath3 0.04 mag / dex , fernley et al .",
    "1998b ) , and from the hb luminosity of 20 globular clusters in the andromeda galaxy ( @xmath44$]=0.20 mag / dex @xmath30.09 , rich et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we have combined the @xmath45 values derived from the model fitting ( see column 13 of table  [ t : table2 ] ) with the metallicities used in the fitting ( see column 4 of table  [ t : table2 ] ) to determine the slope of the luminosity - metallicity relation defined by the 14 lmc rr lyrae stars in our sample . a simple linear fit provides a slope of @xmath44$]=0.34 mag / dex using all objects and of 0.28 mag / dex if star # 2517 , the object with rather unusually faint absolute magnitude , is discarded . the same linear regression using the corresponding dereddened apparent magnitudes @xmath46 ( obtained from the average @xmath19 values in column 4 of table  [ t : table1 ] corrected for the reddenings in column 8 of table  [ t : table5 ] assuming the standard extinction law ) would give @xmath44$]=0.31 and 0.24 , respectively .",
    "all these values are higher than the slope derived by c03 and g04 . however , since the @xmath46 _ versus _ [ fe / h ] fit also provides steeper slopes compared to c03 and g04 value , this demonstrates that the difference is due to the sample selection , and that it does not arise from errors in the absolute magnitudes obtained by the model fitting .",
    "indeed , it should be kept in mind that the 14 lmc rr lyrae stars analyzed in this paper represent less than 15% of c03 and g04 sample , and that although the peak of the fit metallicities of our rr lyrae subsample ( [ fe / h]@xmath47=@xmath11.53 ) is very close to the average metallicity of c03 and g04 total sample , our metallicity distribution is more unbalanced towards low metal abundances .",
    "moreover , the comparison with the zahb evolutionary predictions indicates the presence of evolutionary effects for almost all the metal poor objects in our sample , and these effects are expected to cause a steepening of the slope .",
    "thus the higher slopes found here are simply the result of both the poorer statistics and the higher incidence of evolutionary effects in our sample compared to c03 and g04 one .",
    "we have fitted the nonlinear convective pulsation models by bono et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and marconi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to 14 lmc rr lyrae stars with accurate photometry , metal abundances , and reddening estimates by df04 , g024 and c03 .",
    "this is the first time that the model fitting technique is applied to a significantly large number of rr lyrae stars within the same stellar system , thus providing an important assessment of the predictive capabilities of the adopted theoretical pulsation models and , at the same time , a new independent estimate of the population ii distance to this fundamental fist step of the astronomical distance ladder .",
    "masses , luminosities , and effective temperatures derived from to the model fitting are in satisfactory agreement with the predictions of theoretical hb models , as derived from various authors in the literature .",
    "we notice that such a detailed and punctual comparison between the results of pulsation model fitting and the evolutionary expectations had never been performed in the previous applications of the method to rr lyrae stars .",
    "finally we remind that our final result for the lmc distance modulus is in excellent agreement with the estimate provided by keller & wood ( 2002 ) on the basis of a similar method applied to 20 classical cepheids in the same stellar system .",
    "this occurrence suggests that the results of the model fitting technique are only marginally dependent on the adopted pulsation code , as well as on the physical and numerical assumptions in the model computations .",
    "it also shows that there is no discrepancy between the population i and population ii distance scales to the large magellanic cloud .",
    "we warmly thank santi cassisi , marcio catelan and don vandenberg for providing us their zahb models in electronic forms . a special thanks",
    "goes to vittoria caloi and franca dantona for sending us their evolutionary models in advance of publication and for specifically computing some of the zahbs used in the comparison with the evolutionary models .",
