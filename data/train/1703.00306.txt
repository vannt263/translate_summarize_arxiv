    "one consequence of confinement in qcd is that physical observables admit an interpretation in terms of hadronic states .",
    "this means that at low temperatures the theory can be written in terms of ground state hadrons and their resonances .",
    "such an approach for describing the thermodynamics of qcd is adopted by the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model  @xcite , where all known hadrons are included .",
    "the model assumes that resonance formation governs the thermodynamics of the confined phase , and as a first approximation , treats the resonances as point - like , neglecting their mutual interactions .",
    "however , a closer inspection of the individual interaction channels of hadrons reveals that not all resonances should be incorporated as zero - width particles in the hrg partition sum  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that some of the attractive channels are counteracted by a corresponding repulsive channel with a different isospin .",
    "this point is stressed in recent studies of @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering  @xcite , where a strong cancellation between different isospin channels in the s - wave is demonstrated .",
    "consequently , the contribution of the two lightest scalar resonances , i.e. , the @xmath5 and the ( not yet confirmed ) @xmath6 , to the hrg partition function requires additional care .",
    "it is also necessary to account for the non - ideal behavior of the hadron gas .",
    "in particular , the fact that hadrons are not point - like particles but extended objects means that they can not approach arbitrarily close to each other without interacting .",
    "inspired by the short - range repulsion between nucleons , it is generally assumed that this interaction is repulsive  , which at a given temperature and chemical potential tends to lower the thermodynamic pressure .",
    "such a repulsive interaction among the hadrons is commonly implemented by introducing an excluded volume , first suggested by hagedorn , rafelski and gorenstein _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and later reformulated in a thermodynamically self - consistent version  @xcite .",
    "these models introduce the particle eigenvolume as a model parameter .",
    "the eigenvolume is usually assumed to be a constant or inferred from the bag - model @xcite .",
    "the s - matrix formalism , on the other hand , provides a consistent theoretical framework for implementing the mutual interaction among the hadrons  @xcite . within this approach , the interaction contribution to the thermodynamic pressure is , to leading order in the relativistic virial expansion , determined by the phase shifts for two - particle scattering .",
    "this scheme provides a natural framework to account for both attractive and repulsive hadronic forces .",
    "the phase shifts can be computed theoretically from hadron - hadron interactions or obtained by analyzing scattering experiments .",
    "the former offers a flexible theoretical tool for exploring the consequences of repulsive forces on the thermodynamics of a hadron gas .    in this paper , we compare two approaches to modeling repulsive interactions among hadrons : the excluded volume approximation and the s - matrix formalism .",
    "these are used to study the contribution of repulsive forces on the thermodynamics of the @xmath0 system .",
    "the effect of an excluded volume on the equation of state of a hadronic system has been extensively studied at finite temperature and baryon density @xcite . in this work we focus on the significant differences between the two approaches in computing the temperature dependence of thermal observables , in particular , the thermodynamic pressure and the variance of net baryon number fluctuations .",
    "we show that the introduction of an extraneous repulsive force in the @xmath2 channel of @xmath7 scattering leads to a distortion of the phase shift of the channel .",
    "therefore , the undifferentiated application of excluded volume effects in all interaction channels is highly questionable .",
    "moreover , such a scheme leads to a suppression of the thermodynamic pressure and other derived observables , compared to a consistent implementation of interactions in the s - matrix approach based on phenomenological phase shifts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce different models of repulsive interactions . in section iii",
    "we discuss their influence on thermodynamics in the @xmath8 system . in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "based on phenomenological nucleon - nucleon interactions , it is commonly assumed that all hadrons repel each other at short distances . in the equation of state of hot and dense strongly interacting matter , this is often implemented by introducing an excluded volume  @xcite .",
    "this leads to an equation of state similar to the van der waals equation for non - ideal gas . following ref .",
    "@xcite , a thermodynamically self - consistent formulation of the model can be summarized as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the eigenvolume of the particle , @xmath11 is the pressure function of the original ideal system , and @xmath12 is the pressure function including the excluded volume effect .    note that @xmath13 is expected to be a known function of temperature and chemical potential , and eq",
    ".   defines an implicit equation for @xmath14 .",
    "the latter has to be solved self - consistently , and from this other thermal observables can be derived .    to demonstrate we consider the introduction of a constant excluded volume @xmath10 to an ideal gas of hadrons . in this case ,    @xmath15    here @xmath16 is the standard ideal gas expression of the thermodynamic pressure for species @xmath17 ,    @xmath18    where the @xmath19 sign applies to fermions and bosons respectively , @xmath20 s are the conserved charges of particle @xmath17 , and @xmath21 being the chemical potentials associated with the conserved charges @xmath22 . in the particle",
    "sum the species index @xmath17 distinguishes between a particle and an anti - particle .",
    "the full excluded - volume pressure @xmath12 for this system can be solved by applying @xmath11 from eqs .  -   to eq .  .",
    "derivation of other thermodynamical observables is straightforward @xcite .",
    "here we give the explicit expressions particularly for the net baryon number @xmath23 and the baryon number susceptibility @xmath24 :    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are given by the standard ideal gas expression for number density and particle - number susceptibility , respectively :    @xmath30    and    @xmath31    note that the various ideal gas quantities @xmath32 are evaluated at the shifted chemical potential @xmath33 , defined in eq .  .",
    "the net - baryon number vanishes as expected at @xmath34 due to the cancellation between the contributions from particle and anti - particle . at the same limit",
    ", @xmath35 vanishes , and the baryon number susceptibility has a similar structure as the ideal gas counterpart , albeit the evaluation at the shifted chemical potential @xmath33 and the correction factor @xmath36 from the excluded volume effect .",
    "the determination of the thermodynamic pressure within the s - matrix approach is a two - step process .",
    "firstly , one must specify the phase shift for the interaction channel .",
    "this may be obtained empirically from the relevant scattering experiment or calculated from a phenomenological model .",
    "secondly , one must compute the thermodynamic observables from the phase shift .",
    "this can be achieved by applying the relativistic virial expansion introduced by dashen _",
    "_ @xcite .    here",
    "we demonstrate the method by studying a mixture of bosons and fermions with a hard - core type potential between the bosonic and fermionic constituents .",
    "the quantum mechanical problem of hard - sphere scatterings is rather standard , and we simply quote the result of the phase shift @xmath37 for arbitrary orbital angular momentum @xmath38 @xcite :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are respectively the first and the second kind of spherical bessel function , @xmath42 is the relative momentum in the reduced system , and @xmath43 is the scattering length . for small @xmath44 , one gets    @xmath45    displaying the expected behavior of @xmath46 near the threshold .",
    "having obtained an analytic expression for the phase shift of a hard - core potential , we proceed to compute its contribution to the thermodynamic pressure . the first correction to pressure due to interaction",
    "is given by the second virial coefficient , which is expressible in terms of the scattering phase shift via the famous formula of beth and uhlenbeck @xcite .",
    "the interaction contribution to the pressure then reads         @xmath47    where    @xmath48    here we have considered the case for the scattering between a fermion ( with mass @xmath49 and chemical potential @xmath50 ) and a boson ( with mass @xmath51 and chemical potential @xmath52 ) .",
    "the angular momentum of this two - body system is denoted by @xmath38 .    the interacting pressure in eq .",
    "clearly displays the statistical averaging ( the integral over @xmath53 ) over an ensemble of effective particles of mass @xmath54 and the degeneracy factor @xmath55 .",
    "it also contains the dynamical structure ( the integral over @xmath54 ) describing the correlation of the microscopic constituents .",
    "the fermi statistics of the combined system , i.e. the use of @xmath56 , is a consequence of the resummation of exchange diagrams from the higher virial terms @xcite . finally , @xmath57 can be interpreted as an effective spectral function , which describes the change in the density of states due to interaction .",
    "we now apply the two formulations of the repulsive force to study the thermodynamics of the @xmath0 system . for this purpose , we consider the isospin @xmath58 , p - wave channel of the @xmath59 scattering .",
    "to calculate the pressure within the excluded volume approximation , we identify the constant eigenvolume @xmath10 with  @xcite    @xmath60    and fix @xmath61 .",
    "once the excluded volume is specified , the pressure can be obtained by solving eq .   self - consistently ( _ model a _ ) .    for an analogous study within the s - matrix approach ,",
    "we make use of the empirical @xmath2 phase shift  @xcite in the elastic region , @xmath62 . the phase shift can be expressed by the following phenomenological equation inspired by a one - loop perturbative calculation of @xmath1 self - energy ,    @xmath63    where @xmath42 is the momentum of the scattering constituents in the center - of - mass frame , expressible in @xmath54 , as    @xmath64    and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , are model parameters .",
    "these are chosen to reproduce not only the phase shift data but also the p - wave scattering length ,    @xmath69    which is compatible with the experimental value  @xcite , @xmath70 .",
    "this condition is essential for the correct description of the low invariant - mass behaviors of the density function @xmath71 in eq .   .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : one ] , we present the numerical results for temperature - scaled pressure @xmath72 and baryon number susceptibility , @xmath73 , under different approximation schemes , at vanishing chemical potentials . from the left - hand figure , we observe that the s - matrix result on the thermodynamic pressure is comparable to that of a free gas of pions , nucleons and @xmath1-baryons .",
    "the minute difference becomes more appreciable when one focuses only on the baryonic sector , e.g. studying the observable @xmath73 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one]-right .",
    "this agreement , however , is only accidental , and should not be interpreted as a justification for the zero - width treatment of @xmath1 baryons .",
    "in fact , @xmath74 is a broad resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] ) , and the criteria of effective elementarity suggested by dashen _",
    "@xcite does not apply . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective spectral function @xmath71 contains both the standard spectral function contribution ( @xmath1 ) and the contribution from a correlated @xmath59 pair .",
    "the latter leads to an enhancement in the thermal observables above the corresponding breit - wigner limit .",
    "the combination of the two effects brings about the current condition of an apparent agreement with the free gas result .",
    "the empirical phase shift suggests that the repulsive interaction within this channel , if exists , is rather weak . on the other hand , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , the excluded volume approach yields a much stronger modification to the thermodynamic pressure .",
    "the corresponding difference in the predictions of baryon number susceptibility is not as prominent . in this case",
    "the correction from the excluded volume approach is only moderate , since its magnitude , to leading order in @xmath10 , is proportional to the ideal gas value of @xmath75 , which is much smaller than the value of the pressure in the absence of repulsion .",
    "the standard implementation of the excluded volume approach ( _ model a _ ) introduces repulsions among all hadron species . consequently , in @xmath8 system , in addition to the repulsion between pions and nucleons , the repulsion among pions",
    "are also included .",
    "for further model comparison with the s - matrix approach , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite , and introduce excluded volume effects only between pions and nucleons ( _ model b _ ) . in this case ,    @xmath76    and similar to eq .",
    ", the system of equations have to be solved self - consistently .",
    "the corresponding @xmath75 may be explicitly derived but the resulting expression is not particularly illuminating .",
    "instead we resort to a direct numerical computation of @xmath77-derivatives of @xmath78 in eq .  .",
    "it is interesting to compare _ model b _ with a modified s - matrix treatment ( _ scheme @xmath79 _ ) .",
    "here we impose an additional repulsive force on the previous result in eq .   via a hard - core phase shift in the p - wave , as @xmath80    and",
    "fix @xmath81 , in order to compare with the excluded volume results . here",
    "@xmath43 is identified as the closest distance of approach between two hard spheres . in this _ scheme",
    "_ , the thermodynamic pressure can be readily obtained from eqs .  -  .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , both approaches give comparable corrections to the thermodynamics .",
    "the effect is , as expected , much smaller due to the p - wave nature of the repulsion .",
    "however , in view of the empirical phase shift , even such a small modification is physically inconsistent . in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , it is shown that the introduction of an additional repulsive force distorts the phase shift in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "this is shown together with the effective spectral function introduced in eq .  .",
    "from fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , it is clear that the modification by the repulsive core is already substantial in the region of large center - of - mass energy .",
    "this , however , is unphysical , since the empirical phase shift should already contain all the attractive and repulsive interactions , regardless of their origin .",
    "therefore , as far as the phase shift is concerned , the application of the additional excluded volume effect in the @xmath2 channel is redundant .",
    "we have compared two approaches in modeling repulsive interactions .",
    "the excluded volume approach imposes the idea of closest - distance - of - approach among hadrons in a classical - statistical framework , while the s - matrix approach implements the same idea based on the quantum - mechanical problem of a hard - core potential .",
    "the major observation is that the introduction of an excluded volume between pions and nucleons , in addition to the interaction that generates the @xmath1-resonance , leads to a distortion of the phase shift in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "this is unphysical since the empirical phase shift should already contains all the attractive and repulsive interactions , regardless of their origin .",
    "therefore , as far as the phase shift is concerned , there is no need to introduce an additional excluded volume in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "this suggests that the intricate repulsive force between hadrons is heavily interaction - channel dependent , and is hence unlikely to be captured by a single phenomenological parameter .",
    "nevertheless , from a modeling perspective , the implementation of repulsive forces via the s - matrix formalism has the flexibility to accommodate a channel - dependent scattering length .",
    "this idea is supported by phenomenology , e.g. in the study of @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering phase shifts in ref .",
    "@xcite , a strong isospin dependence of the hard - core radius parameter is indicated by the experimental data .",
    "the isospin @xmath82 ( @xmath58 ) radius is found to be significantly smaller than the isospin @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) counterpart for the case of s - wave @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) scattering .",
    "this represents a further generalization of the approach where one associates an eigenvolume to a particle species @xcite , since in the current case the same particle could have a different effective hard - core radius , depending on the interaction channel .",
