    "techniques , based on adiabatic evolution are among the most popular methods for coherent atomic manipulation @xcite . during the adiabatic evolution ,",
    "the system remains in an eigenstate of the time - dependent hamiltonian . if this eigenstate is such that it connects different bare states in the beginning and in the end of the evolution , than it can be used for population transfer .",
    "however , perfectly adiabatic evolution is hard to realize , and in a real experiment usually there exists some ( hopefully small ) nonadiabatic coupling , which causes transitions between the eigenstates of the hamiltonian and decreases the efficiency of the population transfer .",
    "many methods have been proposed to improve adiabatic evolution , for instance by using composite pulses @xcite or parallel adiabatic passage @xcite .",
    "another popular approach is to use a _ shortcut to adiabaticity _ , by adding extra fields which aim to nullify the nonadiabatic coupling @xcite .",
    "most of the proposed techniques only use hermitian hamiltonians , and only little is known in the non - hermitian case @xcite . in the recent years , however , an increasing interest has been devoted to study non - hermitian hamiltonians , especially in the context of @xmath0-symmetric systems @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated , for instance , that a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian can produce a faster than hermitian evolution in a two - state quantum system , while keeping the eigenenergy difference fixed @xcite .",
    "some non - hermitian extensions @xcite were also done to the landau - zener ( lz ) model , which is a standard tool for the description of level - crossing systems .",
    "the dynamics of certain time - dependent @xmath0-symmetric two - level hamiltonians have been discussed in recent works as well @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose to realize a shortcut to adiabaticity by using complex - valued energies , which produce a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "our approach allows to improve the speed of the rapid adiabatic passage , without the need to increase the coupling , unlike in the standard shortcuts methods in hermitian systems .",
    "we apply this approach to two famous models , namely the lz and the allen - eberly ( ae ) models , both of which are used for the description of level - crossing systems .",
    "the method is , however , applicable to a much larger variety of models .",
    "the main differences between hermitian and non - hermitian adiabatic shortcut methods will be discussed .",
    "in this section we will briefly review the theory behind the rapid adiabatic passage for a two - level hermitian system ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamics of a two - state quantum system is described by the schrdinger equation , [ schr ] i_t ( t ) = ( t)(t ) , where the vector @xmath1^t$ ] contains the two probability amplitudes of the bare ( diabatic ) states @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian in the rotating - wave approximation is [ h ] ( t ) = 2 , where @xmath4 is the rabi frequency , which quantifies the strength of the coupling between states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and @xmath5 is the detuning between the external field and the bohr frequency of the transition . to study adiabatic passage ,",
    "we introduce the so - called adiabatic states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are the eigenstates of the time - dependent hamiltonian , ( t ) _ ( t ) = _ _ ( t ) , with eigenvalues [ eigenenergies ] _ = 12 [ ] . the amplitudes in the adiabatic basis @xmath8^t$ ] are connected with the diabatic ones @xmath9 via the rotation matrix ( ) = , as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "the schrdinger equation in the adiabatic basis reads [ schr - adiabatic ] i=_a , where [ h adiabatic ] _ a = .",
    "if @xmath12 , then the evoution is adiabatic and we can neglect the transitions between the adiabatic states . finally , if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are chosen in such way that _ t- /2 , _",
    "t 0 then we have _ + ( -)= 1,_+()= 2 , which means that the adiabatic following will produce complete population transfer from state @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the efficiency of this transfer is limited by the adiabatic condition @xmath15 , which requires slow evolution .",
    "complete population transfer by adiabatic following can be realized , for instance by using the lz model @xcite , the ae model @xcite , or by using linearly chirped gaussian pulses @xcite .",
    "in this section we will show how the efficiency of the transfer can be improved by adding a suitably chosen non - hermitian term @xmath16 , which aims to nullify the nonadiabatic coupling .",
    "for this goal , we add a nonzero @xmath17 term in the hamiltonian , and we obtain [ hnh ] ^(t ) = 2 .",
    "two - level non - hermitian hamiltonians have been considered in several recent works ( see , for instance , @xcite ) and used to model , for example , the dynamics of open two - level systems or light transport in an optical directional coupler with gain and/or loss regions .",
    "for example , the hamiltonian can be used to describe the physics of two coupled waveguides ( cavities ) with an asymmetric gain - loss profile and propagation constant detuning that varies with distance ( time ) @xcite .",
    "+ in the basis @xmath18 the hamiltonian has the form @xmath19 . \\def\\t{(t)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are again defined by eq .  .",
    "we assume that initially the system is in state @xmath2 , which in that moment coincides with @xmath6 .",
    "next , if we choose @xmath21 , we can nullify @xmath22 , which means that state @xmath7 , which is not populated initially , never receives any population during the evolution .",
    "since state @xmath6 initially coincides with state @xmath2 , and finally with state @xmath3 , this allows the transfer to be realized at any arbitrary speed .",
    "( solid line ) , @xmath23 ( dashed line ) and @xmath24 ( dot - dashed line ) . ]",
    "we shall now consider two special cases , which will reveal how to apply the described technique in a concrete situation .",
    "the first example is the lz model , = _ 0 = , = ^2 t , where @xmath25 is the slope of the crossing and , without loss of generality , we consider @xmath26 .",
    "it is convinient to introduce the dimensionless parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "then , it is easy to show that the nonadiabatic coupling has the form of a lorentzian , = - = and hence , in order to nullify it , we choose [ gamma ] = = = . in such a way , the hamiltonian in the basis @xmath18 becomes @xmath29 , \\def\\t{(t)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where _ = ( t ) and [ cos ] 2= .",
    "if our system is prepared initially in state @xmath30\\approx [ 1,0]$ ] , then we will have @xmath31 and @xmath32 . by using the schrdinger equation",
    "we obtain for the evolution of the amplitudes @xmath33 for any value of @xmath34 .",
    "it can be seen from eq . that @xmath35 is an even function of time and from eq . that @xmath36 is an odd function of time .",
    "hence , if we assume that the @xmath37 , the norm of the state vector at @xmath38 is equal to unity , because the real part of the integral in eq .",
    "this property holds whenever @xmath13 is an even function of time and @xmath14 is an odd function of time . in fig .",
    "[ lzfig ] we compare the evolution of the populations @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the two bare states for the standard lz model and for the one with the additional non - hermitian term @xmath41 .",
    "it can be seen that in the case of the non - hermitian lz model the population transfer is always perfect , regardless of the value @xmath42 of the interaction strength .",
    "however , the smaller the value of @xmath42 , the larger loss / gain rate has to be included .",
    "it should be noted here , that since the hamiltonian is non - hermitian , the norm of the state vector , given by @xmath43 , does not need to be conserved during the evolution .",
    "this property can be seen in fig .",
    "[ lzfig](middle frame ) , where the norm is not conserved during the interaction .",
    "however , because of the symmetry of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the initial and final norm of the state vector is unity . another important point that should be emphasized is that we only consider evolution in a finite time .",
    "since the integral of @xmath35 is divergent , we have to cut it in time in order to prevent the population @xmath39 to increase to values larger than unity . in the case of fig .",
    "[ lzfig ] , the time interval is @xmath46 $ ] . before @xmath47 and after @xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath17 is assumed equal to zero .",
    "we want to note here , that unlike the standard lz model , where it is well known that the two bare energies cross in time , in the non - hermitan lz model , because of the extra imaginary term , the two curves do not cross in the complex plane . in fig .",
    "[ energies ] we show a schematic plot of the bare energies @xmath48 for the standard and non - hermitian lz models and this feature is well illustrated .",
    ", the energies do not cross . ]",
    "it is worth saying that a physical implementation of the non - hermitian shortcut to adiabaticity above designed for the lz model can be accomplished in waveguide optics . as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , lz tunneling with linear crossing of energy levels can be mimicked in a directional coupler with a cubically bent profile for the waveguide axis .",
    "the required gain / loss imbalance between the two waveguides @xmath49 , with @xmath50 provided by eq .",
    ", can be implemented by cascading a purely dissipative coupler with non - uniform propagation loss , and an active coupler with uniform gain , precisely as suggested in a recent paper on pt - symmetric unidirectional reflectionless metamaterials  @xcite .",
    "finally , the non - uniform loss profile @xmath50 can be obtained by evanescent coupling of the waveguide mode with a metallic thin film cover of suitable geometry deposited on top of the passive waveguides , a technique that has been already exploited to produce a sinusoidally - shaped loss profile along the axis of a silicon on silica channel waveguide  @xcite .    as a second example",
    ", we consider the ae model = _ 0 ( t/ ) , = d ( t/ ) , where @xmath51 is the characteristic duration of the interacion and @xmath52 is a real parameter , corresponding to the chirp rate .",
    "we proceed the same way as with the lz model and calculate = , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for the gain / loss function",
    "we obtain = , where again , like for the lz model , we assume that this function is taken within some finite symmetric time interval . in fig .",
    "[ aefig ] we show the population evolution for the ae model with and without the addition of the term @xmath41 . unlike the lz model , here",
    "the function @xmath17 does not vanish at @xmath55 , but tends to a constant value .    , but for the ae model .",
    "the values of the interaction parameters are @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( solid line ) , @xmath58 ( dashed line ) and @xmath59 ( dot - dashed line ) . unlike for the non - hermitian lz model , here the three curves for @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the non - hermitian ae model are undistinguishable . ]",
    "in this work we have proposed a method of non - hermitian shortcut to adiabaticity , that enables to achieve an arbitrarily fast population transfer in a two - state quantum system .",
    "this is performed by introducing a non - hermitian term in the hamiltonian , which has the purpose to cancel the nonadiabatic coupling .",
    "the improvement of the population transfer is explicitly demonstrated for the special cases of the landau - zener and allen - eberly models .",
    "a few major differences between our method and the shortcut technique of hermitian systems should be highlighted . in the standard hermitian shortcuts to adiabaticity @xcite additional fields are used , which couple the bare states in such way that the resultant nonadiabatic coupling is zero .",
    "these techniques allow to speed up the adiabatic evolution , but at the cost of increasing the coupling .",
    "conversely , in the non - hermitian case proposed in our work the population transfer can be made arbitrarily fast , even for an arbitrarily small coupling between the two states , by introducing a complex - valued detuning ( energies ) of the uncoupled system .",
    "this non - hermitian term corresponds to gain or loss ( depending on the sign ) of population in the two bare states .",
    "such terms can be physically realized , for instance , in two coupled optical waveguides with longitudinally - varying gain and loss regions @xcite .",
    "a second feature is that the shortcut to adiabaticity in the non - hermitian model is sensitive to the initial condition of the system . in order to have the norm of the state vector preserved ,",
    "we need to start exactly from @xmath30 $ ] , which in our case is approximately equal to @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "if we deviate from this condition , the technique will still produce complete transfer of population , but without preserving the norm and some extra gain or loss may be introduced . finally , a third and very distinctive difference is that the non - hermitian shortcut to adiabaticity is not symmetric against flipping the initial condition .",
    "as the standard hermitian shortcuts produce complete population transfer both for the initial conditions @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] , our technique demands a change in the sign of @xmath17 ( i.e. the interchange of gain and loss terms ) for the two different situations .",
    "our analysis suggests that adiabatic passage techniques well - developed for hermitian systems can be extended to non - hermitian ones , with extra degrees of freedoms and novel dynamical features .",
    "it is envisaged that our study , which has been focused to the simplest cases of adiabatic passage methods in a two - level system , could stimulate further studies of coherent population transfer techniques of multi - level systems ( such as stirap @xcite ) for non - hermitian systems .",
