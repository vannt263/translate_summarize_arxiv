    "geometrical frustration in electronic degrees of freedom such as spin , charge , and orbit , which is often realized in the stages of highly symmetric crystals , has been one of the major topics in the field of condensed matter physics . in particular , the heavy fermion ( hf ) behavior in y@xmath16sc@xmath17mn@xmath0  [ y(sc)mn@xmath0]@xcite and liv@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite has attracted broad interest , where such a local electronic correlation specific to the highly symmetric pyrochlore structure may be of direct relevance to the formation of the heavy quasiparticle ( qp ) state .",
    "however , despite decades of studies , the microscopic mechanism by which the local correlation is transformed into the heavy qp mass of itinerant @xmath19-electrons in these compounds still remains controversial .    in general , the development of heavy qps accompanies narrowing of the effective band width ( @xmath20 ) or an increase in the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy [ @xmath10 ] .",
    "it is thus expected from a naive consideration based on heisenberg s uncertainty principle that the hf behavior should manifest itself in the spin dynamics as reduction of the spin fluctuation rate ( @xmath8 ) because these quantities are mutually linked by the following relation : @xmath22 since the effective qp mass is directly connected to the dos via the relation @xmath23^{2/3}$ ] for a three - dimensional ( 3d ) fermi gas , studies on the spin fluctuation with particular emphasis on relatively low energies should provide valuable information on the mechanism of heavy qp formation .    as a probe of spin fluctuation , muon spin rotation ( @xmath24sr ) has a unique frequency window with high sensitivity for @xmath25 s@xmath26 , filling the gap between those covered by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and neutron scattering .",
    "this provides promising perspectives for the @xmath24sr study of @xmath19-electron hf - like compounds . here",
    ", we establish that the longitudinal spin relaxation rate ( @xmath4 ) in the above - mentioned compounds exhibits a common feature that it asymptotically becomes independent of temperature upon cooling below a crossover temperature of @xmath27@xmath28 k. this , within the framework of fermionic qps , means that the spin fluctuation rate becomes linearly dependent on temperature , @xmath12 , which is in marked contrast to ordinary metals , where @xmath8 is independent of @xmath3 as determined by the dos at the fermi level .",
    "considering that the transition - metal ions in these compounds comprise a pyrochlore lattice , it is naturally expected that the above - mentioned feature in the spin dynamics will be specific to the relevant lattice structure .",
    "we argue that this is indeed the case in that the underlying spin dynamics can be understood by the spin correlation of the intersecting hubbard chains , which provides a model of the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "this strongly indicates the crucial role of @xmath15 bands that preserve the one - dimensional ( 1d ) character specific to the undistorted pyrochlore lattice at low energies , which is consistent with a theoretical scenario that the 1d-3d crossover due to coupling between these 1d chains developing at low temperatures is the origin of the hf behavior .    in the following",
    ", we present an overview of our @xmath24sr  results for y(sc)mn@xmath0@xcite , ymn@xmath0zn@xmath29in@xmath17,@xcite and liv@xmath0o@xmath1,@xcite where the temperature dependence of @xmath11 is the primary focus .",
    "then , the temperature dependence of the spin fluctuation rate is discussed in connection with a possible scenario for the origin of heavy qps in these compounds .",
    "we also show that the anomalous behavior of @xmath11 is accompanied by strong broadening of the linewidth under a transverse field ( @xmath30 ) , which is not explained by the hyperfine parameters extrapolated from their values at high temperatures@xcite .",
    "as a probe of spin fluctuation in condensed matter , @xmath24sr  is kin to nmr , primarily because of the fact that an implanted muon can be regarded as a light radioisotope of a proton ( @xmath31h ) . nonetheless ,",
    "while the physics behind the mechanism of spin relaxation is common , there are two major factors , i.e. , the time windows of observation ( 10@xmath3210@xmath33 s for nmr , 10@xmath3410@xmath35 s for @xmath24sr ) and the relevant sites ( on - site for nmr , interstitial site for @xmath24sr ) , that make these two techniques distinct ( or even complementary with each other )",
    ". it would be useful to highlight such differences by examining the longitudinal spin relaxation rate ( @xmath36 ) in simple metals .    according to korringa s relation , the spin relaxation induced by @xmath37 band electrons",
    "is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 mhz ) and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 mhz ) are the respective gyromagnetic ratios of an electron and muon .",
