    "<S> a simple physical solution is presented and its implications for dft ( as well as its limitations ) are discussed . for two - electron systems ( a case in which the present solution can be calculated exactly ) , we find that an interpolation between the limit @xmath1 and the opposite limit of infinitely strong repulsion ( @xmath2 ) yields a rather accurate estimate of the second - order correlation energy @xmath3 $ ] for several different densities @xmath4 , without using virtual orbitals . the same procedure is also applied to the be isoelectronic series , analyzing the effects of near - degeneracy . </S>"
