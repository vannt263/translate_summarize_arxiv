    "<S> we derive the inclination of the debonding front ( assumed straight ) , and obtain general analytical equations for the crack trajectory and the conditions for propagation ( see _ supplemental material _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of these equations provide an excellent prediction of the experimental path ( see fig  3c , d , e ) . </S>",
    "<S> some particular analytical solutions are worth mentioning . in the case of a crack interacting with a previous straight cut </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a stable width , @xmath51 corresponding to a debonding front tilted by an angle of @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this relation explains the robust tendency to replicate a crack path at a well defined distance observed in experiments ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) , although the quantitative dependence of @xmath1 with @xmath53 is difficult to capture ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the propagation velocity is now set by @xmath54 , with @xmath55 in the case of a crack rotating around a point ( or around the tip of a straight segment ) , we obtain a circle of radius equal to the width @xmath2 of the symmetric band . </S>",
    "<S> crack velocities are also identical , given by @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> since in our system @xmath56 , cracks rotating around a tip , or paired parallel cracks , propagate at lower velocities than cracks following a straight cut . </S>",
    "<S> a crack following a parallel band thus catches up with the paired cracks as illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> more importantly , in the case where adhesion energy is high enough ( @xmath57 ) , rotation around a sharp turning point ( such as the extreme point of the crescent path ) is not energetically possible , and the front stops . in experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that a secondary delamination front then slowly develops , and triggers the propagation of the returning branch , leading to a crescent alley ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> + three main physical ingredients dictate the different crack patterns : the residual energy density per unit surface @xmath8 , the fracture energy of the film @xmath11 and the adhesion energy for vanishing speed @xmath46 . in our experiments with silicate coatings , @xmath8 and @xmath46 </S>",

    "<S> isolated channel cracks propagate when @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> delamination is energetically favorable when the residual elastic energy overcomes adhesion energy , @xmath61 but this mode of failure requires free boundaries to propagate and the damaged zone is usually confined within limited regions along defects or between channel cracks . </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries corresponding to these classical conditions are drawn as straight lines in fig .  4 , and the pink colored domain </S>",
    "<S> is therefore expected to be stable . </S>",
    "<S> however , the collaborative mechanism occurs within this region usually recognized as safe . </S>",
    "<S> two additional limiting boundaries are introduced to describe these modes : @xmath62 which sets the condition to obtain parallel paired cracks ( brown line ) , and @xmath63 for follower cracks ( black line ) . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are compatible with our experiments ( circles and squares represent the patterns experimentally observed ) although experimental uncertainties do not allow quantitative determination of the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> crescent and paired cracks are also observed in the domain where isolated cracks are possible . </S>",
    "<S> different states can indeed coexist for the same set of parameters depending on nucleation . while spirals are triggered by localized defects , </S>",
    "<S> crescent alleys require relatively long initial cracks to develop and parallel bands are found along rough boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> more complicated interacting structures can also be observed when the density of defects is increased ( fig  1.a ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we do not expect any fracture when @xmath64 , which defines a new , reduced domain for the stability of coatings ( in darker pink in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> systems where residual stresses increase progressively ( for instance as drying takes place ) follow a straight line in this diagram starting from the origin . </S>",
    "<S> the first failure mode encountered is therefore either classical isolated cracks or the collaborative modes if @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this condition quantifies the fact that when adhesion energy is weaker than fracture energy , delamination collaborates with transverse fracture into a cooperative failure mode . </S>",

    "<S> however , collaborative delamination cracks are observed within the light pink domain . </S>",
    "<S> the different patterns are observed for @xmath70 ( paired cracks above the brown curve ) , @xmath71 ( spirals and oscillating crescents above the black limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> different patterns are observed for the same range of physical parameters , depending on nucleation geometries . </S>",
    "<S> we observe crescent patterns with larger amplitude closer to the black limit . ]    </S>",
    "<S> although cracks are usually viewed as a failure , the extreme robustness of the self - replicated patterns induced by the collaborative mode presented here can turn fracture into a design tool . </S>",
    "<S> the patterns form spontaneously along a path determined completely by the geometry of the initiation spot independently from inhomogeneities of adhesion properties ( often difficult to control perfectly ) . </S>",
