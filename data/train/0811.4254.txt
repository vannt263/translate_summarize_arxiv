    "growing requests and needs of users of synchrotron radiation call for further improvements of parameters of specialised synchrotron light sources .",
    "one of the most important parameters is the horizontal natural emittance , @xmath3 ( it also defines , through some coupling , the vertical emittance ) .",
    "its value depends on the magnetic structure ( lattice ) of a storage ring , and first of all  on parameters and arrangement of dipole magnets , which should provide a closed orbit for the electron beam . for achromatic lattices dba ( double bend achromat  two dipole magnets per cell ) , tba , qba ,",
    "where the ` intercell ' regions have zero dispersion , the conditions of natural emittance minimization are well known from the works of teng , and lee , @xcite .",
    "the emittance strongly decreases with increase of the number of dipole magnets in a ring , @xmath4 at that , the size and costs of storage ring grow with @xmath5 as well .",
    "the figure of merit of an insertion device ( i d ) , serving as a sr - source , is defined , however , by the _ effective emittance _ , which depends on dispersion ( or courant - snider invariant ) in the i d straight section .",
    "it turns out that the effective emittance can be lowered if to weaken the dispersion - free condition @xcite .",
    "therefore , the beam optics of some electron rings ( elettra , esrf ) , initially achromatic , of dba kind , was modified ( so called distributed dispersion lattice , or quasi - achromat , dba * ) .    with the aim to further reduce the emittance in esrf , together with the doubling of the number of dipoles , from 64 to 128",
    ", they are considering the possibility to use dipoles with varying ( along the orbit ) magnetic field @xcite .    in this work",
    "the problem of minimization of the effective emittance is to be solved for the case when the lattice cell is symmetric ( with respect to inversion in its center ) and includes magnets of two types : _ internal _",
    "dipoles @xmath6 and a pair of the _ end _ ( or side ) dipoles @xmath7 ; the total number of magnets in a cell is @xmath8 .",
    "modified lattices tba * and dba * correspond to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . in the case",
    "@xmath11 , the internal dipoles can also have non - zero shift ; this case will be denoted as qba**.    dipoles with unequal fields serve as sr sources with different critical energy , i.e , with peak regions in different parts of x - ray spectrum , so they can serve better for different ` classes ' of sr users .",
    "however , large number of free parameters , which describe anisomagnetic cell , makes the search of the best parameters ( when the effective emittance is minimal ) a very difficult problem .    here a possible way , an algorithm to solve this problem is suggested , which divides the problem into a few more simple parts . in principle , this approach allows to consider more complex lattice , with three or even four kinds of dipole magnets .",
    "the horizontal emittance of electrons , @xmath3 , and the effective ( horizontal ) emittance , @xmath12 , are defined by the next expressions , relating to some integrals along the orbit ( they depend on the orbit s radius , @xmath13 , and optics function , including @xmath14-function ) @xcite : [ emi ] _ x = c_q^2 _ x , _ x== , [ emi - eff ] _ eff = c_q^2 _ eff , ^2_eff=_x(_x+ ) . here",
    "@xmath15 is relativistic factor , @xmath16)^2 ; \\ ] ] these are the usual notations of some ring integrals : [ ii ]    l i_2 = ^-2ds ,  i_4 = ^-3(1 + 2k ^2 ) ds , + i_3 = ||^-3ds , i_5=||^-3h ds ;    @xmath17 in ( [ emi - eff ] ) is the courant  snyder invariant in the region of insertion devise , [ ics ] h= ^-1\\{^2+(+)^2 } , @xmath18 ; @xmath19 is dispersion function .    some rings , sources of sr , were designed that the regions of i d would have invariant @xmath17 vanishing ( i.e. , dispersion and its derivative are both zero ) , but in the curse of time , lattice parameters were changed to reach better minimization of the effective emittance ( [ emi - eff ] ) .",
    "integral @xmath20 is small in comparison with @xmath21 , so it can be neglected , in the case of separate function magnets ( dipoles have no quadrupole component , and @xmath22 ) .",
    "so , we seek to minimize the next combination of ring integral : [ emi - eff2 ] ^2_eff= = ; and here one should note that integrals @xmath21 and @xmath23 depends only on the field of dipoles ( radius of the orbit ) , but does not depend on betatron and dispersion functions . on the other hand ,",
    "integrals @xmath24 and @xmath25 are a sum of positive contributions from all magnets ( because the courant - snyder invariant is always positive ) .",
    "therefore this problem of optimization can be attempted to be divided into a few relatively simple steps , that is , to be factorized :    \\(1 ) firstly , we make minimization of a magnet s contribution to @xmath24 with respect to parameters @xmath26 , i.e. , the value of beta - function at its minimum , and the dispersion functions in the point of this minimum ( this point serves as the reference point , zero point of the orbit coordinate @xmath27 in a dipole ) ; for the end magnets , which neighbour i d straight sections and directly define invariant @xmath17 , we minimize their contribution to the sum @xmath28 , because it _ approximates _ in a good way the necessary minimization of the product @xmath29 ( the arithmetic mean majorizes the geometric mean ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the other dipole s parameters  the curvature @xmath30 ( or the field ) , the length or the angle of rotation , @xmath31 , as well as the the coordinate of dipole s center , @xmath0 , or the ( dimensionless parameter ) _ shift _ , @xmath32 ,  should be restricted with the matching condition , which states the equality of the courant  snyder invariants on the exit from a dipole and on the entrance to the next one .",
    "one more restriction is that the orbit is closed , i.e. , the sum of angles @xmath33 of all dipole magnets is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "\\(3 ) after eliminating the angles , one can minimize the effective emittance with respect to the rest ( two or three ) parameters : @xmath35 ( the internal magnets can have nonzero shift @xmath36 , if their number is two ) .",
    "it is well known that the contribution of a dipole magnet to the ( natural ) emittance is minimal when its center coincide with the minimum of beta - function ( besides , this minimum and the dispersion parameters should have definite values depending on the magnet s field @xcite ) . such a magnet can be called _ symmetric _ ( of symmetric arrangement ) , or _",
    "unshifted _ ; otherwise , we have a magnet with a shift .    as a rule , lattices consist of repeating , equal collections of dipole magnets  cells or periods ( or superperiods )",
    ". we will consider quite general case of a periodic lattice of @xmath37 symmetric cells ( inversion in the cell center ) .",
    "every cell contains @xmath38 dipole magnets , including @xmath39 internal magnets @xmath6 ( unshifted , as a rule ) , and two ( one on each side ) end magnets @xmath7 , with a shift @xmath40 .",
    "considering the right half of the cell , we will imply that the shift of the end magnet is positive ( and it is negative in the left half of the cell ) .",
    "the total number of dipoles is @xmath41 ; their rotation angles , @xmath42 , should comply with the requirement : [ vvs ] _",

    "it is assumed that angles @xmath33 are small enough ( for all dipoles of the storage ring ) , so already the first terms of angle expansion gives a sufficient accuracy .",
