    "attempt frequencies were constrained to one order of magnitude using raman spectroscopy data ( where anomalous low - frequency modes are identified with the attempt frequencies @xcite ) , and agree with typical values for similar compounds ( e.g. cui @xcite ) .",
    "the activation energies resulting from the fit are given in the paper .",
    "the approximation of independent defects is most probably adequate for temperatures not very close to @xmath8 , but the reliability of our fitting model can be questioned near @xmath8 , as we suppose that only the number of copper defects grows dramatically .",
    "however , the line shape measurements indicate that indeed copper defects are much more prevalent than mercury  intensity of the @xmath3cu line drops sharply , while @xmath21hg shows no appreciable change ( within the relatively large error margin ) . above @xmath8",
    "the relaxation rate is significantly higher than in the low temperature phase , due to the large number of fast mercury ions . if we assume that the relaxation model of eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the paper is at least approximately valid above @xmath8 , clearly the contribution of mercury ion diffusion will dominate the relaxation rate ( as we know from the absence of motional narrowing in cu that copper motion is much slower , and @xmath83 ) .",

    "the size of this dip in diffusion time dependence provides an estimate of the absolute number of correlated ions .",
    "such behavior is observed in simulation as well  even the same functional dependence ( a stretched exponential ) can be fitted to experimental and simulation results .",
    "it is possible to obtain a good agreement between experiment and simulation in both correlation time and fraction of correlated ions ( for a vacancy fraction of 0.4 and effective copper diffusion coefficient @xmath93 ) , but the simplifying assumption of single copper and mercury jump probabilities makes the stretching parameter of the simulation curve somewhat closer to 1 .",
    "this could be quickly amended by introducing a jump probability distribution by hand , but was deemed physically untransparent .",
    "the agreement between simulation and experiment is already quite impressive in the simple version , and more sophisticated models are needed to account for the finer effects . in absence of trapping , the echo decay should be a simple exponential in @xmath91 , with the decay time equal to the spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath78 .",

    "<S> we obtain direct experimental evidence for this model from a different nmr experiment on mercury  stimulated spin echo ( sse ) measurements ( fig .

    "<S> correct temperature behavior can not be obtained without taking them into account . in contradistinction to glass - forming materials , no slowing down of the correlated dynamics with decreasing temperature is observed in cu@xmath0hgi@xmath1 ; we suspect that this is due to the additional periodic potential , which tends to restore an ordered state ( and succeeds at @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , we believe that a full three - dimensional simulation would show similar cooperative behavior ( with modified vacancy numbers due to a lower percolation threshold ) , but this needs to be proven . more elaborate simulations are needed to better understand these issues .    from our results </S>",
