    "neutrino flavor oscillations @xcite with wavelength comparable to the earth - sun distance @xcite represent a solution @xcite to the deficit of solar @xmath4 s @xcite observed in the four pioneering underground experiments homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , sage @xcite , and gallex @xcite , as compared to the standard solar model predictions @xcite .",
    "the recent superkamiokande data @xcite confirm the deficit , and can be interpreted within the vacuum oscillation hypothesis as well @xcite . the planned borexino solar neutrino experiment @xcite ( in construction ) , designed to detect monochromatic @xmath5be neutrinos ( @xmath6 mev ) , is expected to test this hypothesis with unprecedented sensitivity @xcite .",
    "an update of the current neutrino flux measurements @xcite is given in table  i. figure  1 shows our vacuum oscillation fit to the data of table  i , as obtained from a @xmath7 analysis ( including solar model uncertainties as in @xcite ) .",
    "we have assumed , for simplicity , two neutrino families .",
    "it can be seen that four regions ( a , b , c , and d ) are allowed at 95% c.l .",
    ", the absolute minimum being located within the solution b ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "various tests can be envisaged to discriminate among the four solutions in fig .  1 .",
    "in particular , since the neutrino oscillation length is proportional to the pathlength - to - energy ratio @xmath0 , deviations of event distributions from the expected shape in either @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( or related parameters ) represent direct tests of neutrino vacuum oscillations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that , in general , superkamiokande is more ( less ) sensitive than borexino to @xmath3-related ( @xmath2-related ) spectral shape deviations ; therefore , the two experiments provide complementary tools to study the vacuum oscillation hypothesis .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate in detail the tests of the vacuum oscillation hypothesis that can be performed at superkamiokande and borexino , and their interplay .",
    "the results will be shown in a form that makes easy to derive the experimental accuracy needed to perform a specific test .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the tests of energy spectra deviations , in the light of the recent superkamiokande results . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss in detail the fourier analysis of the signal , building upon our previous work @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii we apply these tests to superkamiokande and borexino , both separately and jointly . in sec .",
    "iv we draw our conclusions . some technical aspects of our analysis are described in the appendix .",
    "both superkamiokande and borexino can measure the energy spectrum of recoil electrons from neutrino scattering .",
    "the standard ( i.e. , no oscillation ) superkamiokande spectrum can be found in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "2 the standard electron energy spectrum in borexino ( details about the inclusion of energy threshold and resolution effects are given in the appendix ) .",
    "the main contribution to the spectrum in fig .",
    "2 is given by the 0.86 mev @xmath5be line , which is responsible for the compton edge at @xmath10 mev .",
    "the edge is smeared by the finite energy resolution .",
    "the rise at low energies is due to @xmath11 neutrinos , while the tail at high energies is basically due to cno neutrinos .",
    "the prospective analysis window is also indicated in fig .  2 .",
    "the standard neutrino fluxes have been taken from @xcite .",
    "distortions of the neutrino energy spectrum due to oscillations are generally reflected ( although somewhat degraded ) in the electron energy spectrum .",
    "an effective parametrization of such distortions is given by the fractional variation of the average kinetic energy @xmath12 of the electron , an approach extensively developed in @xcite and applied to the superkamiokande data in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the analysis @xcite of the most recent ( 374 day ) measurements of the electron spectrum in superkamiokande @xcite gives a fractional deviation @xmath13 such deviation is consistent with zero ( no oscillation ) at the level of @xmath14 , and disfavors scenarios predicting negative values for @xmath15 .",
    "concerning borexino , the expected _ shape _ variations of the energy distribution are very small , since the main contribution to the electron spectrum comes from a monoenergetic source of neutrinos ( @xmath5be ) , rather than from a continuous source as in superkamiokande ( @xmath16b ) .",
    "neutrino oscillations are expected to change significantly the global borexino rate but not its energy spectrum .",
    "the variations of the solar neutrino pathlength @xmath2 due to the eccentricity of the earth orbit produce a geometrical @xmath17 modulation of the neutrino flux .",
    "additional semiannual modulations are expected in the presence of neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the fourier analysis of the measured flux represents an effective tool to study both kinds of @xmath2-related modulations @xcite .    in this section",
    "we outline the fourier analysis of the signal observable in solar neutrino experiments . in the first three subsections",
    ", we describe the general formalism and the results for the `` no oscillation '' and `` @xmath18 oscillation '' cases ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) . in the last two subsections we generalize the analysis to @xmath19 oscillations and",
    "then discuss a useful check of both the symmetry properties and the estimated uncertainties of the signal .",
    "the earth orbit radius , @xmath2 , varies periodically in time @xmath20 around its average value , @xmath21 km , according to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the orbit eccentricity and @xmath24  yr ( @xmath25 at the perihelion ) .",
    "terms of @xmath26 or higher are negligible for our purposes .",
    "the neutrino signal @xmath27 is also , in general , a periodic function . assuming a constant background @xmath28 , the total observed neutrino rate @xmath29 is : @xmath30 for symmetry reasons , the analysis can be restricted to the time interval @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "it is understood that events collected in subsequent half - years must be symmetrically folded in this interval .",
    "the data sample consists then of @xmath32 events collected at different times @xmath33 , with @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath32 equal to the total sum of background and signal events , @xmath35 .",
    "notice that , in general , one can determine @xmath36 and @xmath37 but can not distinguish background and signal on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the expansion of the signal in terms of fourier components @xmath38 reads @xmath39 where @xmath27 is the time - averaged signal @xmath40 the @xmath41-th harmonic corresponds to a period of @xmath42  yr .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath38 reads @xmath43 where eqs .",

    "therefore , to a good approximation , the one - sigma statistical error @xmath47 affecting @xmath38 is given by @xmath48 for _ any _ @xmath41 .",

    "we have made use of this property in eqs .",
    "( [ s][fnexpt ] ) .",
    "the experimental test of such symmetry property is not without merit , since its failure might signal systematic , time - dependent effects , such as unexpected variations of the detection efficiency or of the background level . within our approach",
    ", this is equivalent to check that the `` sine '' fourier components @xmath95 , defined as @xmath96 are identically zero , as they should ( both in the standard case and in the presence of possible oscillations ) : @xmath97 notice that , in eq .",

    "the experimentally inferred @xmath95 s will be distributed around zero with a variance @xmath99 . as far as statistical fluctuations are concerned",
    ", the calculation of @xmath99 is analogous to @xmath100 @xcite and gives : @xmath101 however , as already noticed , the @xmath45 s are generally @xmath46 and thus can be neglected in the above equation .",
    "therefore , the statistical uncertainty @xmath102 is approximately equal for all the @xmath95 s and has the same expression as @xmath103 [ eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) ] .    in conclusion , it is useful to check that the semiannual variations of the solar neutrino signal are indeed symmetric in time .",
    "this implies that the `` sine '' fourier components @xmath95 defined in eq .",
    "( [ gnexpt ] ) should form a distribution with mean value @xmath104 and standard deviation @xmath105 .",
    "this test is universal , i.e.   it is valid with or without oscillation effects .",
    "any deviation of the mean and variance of the @xmath95 distribution from their standard values ( 0 and @xmath106 , respectively ) would indicate the presence ( and the magnitude ) of systematic effects beyond the purely statistical fluctuations of either the background or the signal .",
    "these effects ( if any ) should then be accounted for by the experimentalists , before performing an unbiased analysis of the time variations of the signal .",
    "in this section we analyze the tests of the vacuum oscillation hypothesis that can be performed at superkamiokande and borexino , both separately and jointly .",
    "we consider two observables for each experiment .",

    "figure  3 shows the four solutions a , b , c , and d ( gray regions ) and the no oscillation point ( star ) in the plane charted by the parameters @xmath107 ( the fractional deviation of the mean electron kinetic energy ) and @xmath113 ( the deviation of the first fourier component from its standard value ) .",

    "we can summarize these findings by saying that , under the hypothesis of @xmath18 oscillations , the _ combined _ data of table  i and eq .  ( [ dt ] ) select the solutions a and b in fig .  1 , corresponding to the following approximate ranges ( at 95% c.l . ) for the neutrino mass - mixing parameters : @xmath118 notice that the spread of the above parameters is only about @xmath119 . also notice that @xmath18 maximal mixing @xmath120 is allowed only in a restricted range of @xmath66 ( @xmath121@xmath122 ev@xmath123 ) .",

    ".    an interesting feature of fig .",
    "3 is the tight correlation between the variables @xmath108 and @xmath127 , which parametrize @xmath2-related and @xmath3-related spectral distortions , respectively .",
    "such correlation can be traced to the @xmath0 dependence of the oscillation probability , as emphasized in @xcite .",
    "one can use such correlation to `` predict '' the value of @xmath108 in superkamiokande for a given value of @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ dt ] ) .",
    "more precisely , from fig .  3",
    "one derives that the values of @xmath108 compatible with both the horizontal band and the solution a should lie in the range @xmath128@xmath129 . in other words ,",
    "one expects an enhancement of the semiannual modulations of the neutrino flux ( relatively to the purely geometrical one ) in the range @xmath130=30$]@xmath131 at @xmath132 .",
    "this is a clear prediction that needs , however , several years of data taking at superkamiokande to be tested .      figure  4 shows the four solutions a , b , c , and d ( gray regions ) in the plane charted by the parameters @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( the deviation of the first two fourier components from their standard values ) .",
    "the no oscillation point ( star ) corresponds to the origin .",
    "the amplitude of the second harmonic appears to be generally smaller than the first ; nevertheless , both should be detectable in a sample of a few thousand events .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath135 events , the expected statistical error of @xmath124 and @xmath109 is only about @xmath136 [ see eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) ] , ensuring clear detection of semiannual modulations ( provided that systematics do not dominate the error budget ) .",
    "however , the four solutions a , b , c , d are rather close to each other in the fourier parameter space , and it might be difficult to distinguish among them using only these two variables .    by comparing figs .  3 and 4 , it can be noticed that the solutions a and b ( currently favored by superkamiokande data ) predict rather different values for the first fourier harmonic in superkamiokande and borexino , as a result of the different energy ranges probed by these two experiments . in particular , within solution a it is always @xmath137 , while @xmath133 can be either positive or negative .",
    "therefore , at present the sign of the semiannual variations in borexino is unpredictable .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , both in @xmath18 and @xmath19 oscillations , the fourier component ratio @xmath138 depends only on @xmath66 and not on the mixing angle(s ) [ see eqs .",
    "( [ f2nu ] ) and ( [ f3nu ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , such ratio can constrain the value of @xmath66 in a model - independent way .",
    "figure  5 shows the four solutions a , b , c , and d ( gray regions ) in the four planes charted by the borexino observables @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( @xmath139-axes ) and by the superkamiokande observables @xmath113 and @xmath140 ( @xmath141-axes ) .",
    "also shown is the horizontal band allowed at @xmath114 by the @xmath107 datum of eq .",
    "( [ dt ] ) . within such band , the values of @xmath133 ( as well as those of @xmath134 ) can be either positive or negative , as observed in the previous subsection .",
    "figure  5 shows that the present indeterminacy in the sign of @xmath133 can not be resolved by increasing the accuracy of the superkamiokande data .",
    "the similarity between the upper and lower panels in fig .",
    "5 is due to the tight correlation between the superkamiokande variables @xmath113 and @xmath140 .",
    "this similarity should be reflected in the experimental data , if vacuum oscillations indeed occur .",
    "when experimental data will be available for all the four observables charting the panels in fig .  5 , one of the four solutions should be easily spotted in at least one of the four panels .",
    "however , in the unlucky situation of data points close to the no oscillation case , it might be difficult to distinguish between such case and solution b. the possibility to separate the no oscillation point from solution b would then depend decisively on the reduction of the @xmath140 uncertainty ( see upper panels of fig .  5 ) . in any case",
    ", the reader can judge the discriminating power of the two experiments by drawing prospective data points and error bars in each panel of fig .",
    "we have studied tests of vacuum oscillations of solar neutrinos in the superkamiokande and borexino experiments , both separately and jointly .",
    "the tests are sensitive to either energy or time variations of the neutrino flux .",
    "the interplay between such tests has been investigated , in the light of the most recent data ( 374 day ) from the superkamiokande experiment .",
    "the results have been displayed in a graphical form ( figs .",
    "35 ) that allows to determine easily the experimental accuracy needed to test the vacuum oscillation solution(s ) .",
    "we have found that : ( i ) the total neutrino rates measured by solar @xmath4 experiments can be fitted in four distinct regions of the mass - mixing parameter space ; ( @xmath142 ) two of the four solutions are strongly disfavored by the superkamiokande energy spectrum data ; @xmath143 the energy spectrum data do not discriminate significantly ( at present ) the remaining two solutions between them and from the no oscillation case ; ( @xmath144 the amplitude of semiannual variations of the solar @xmath4 flux in superkamiokande is predicted to be about 3060% in excess of the purely geometric one ( at @xmath145 ) ; @xmath146 the sign of semiannual variations ( due to oscillations ) in borexino is not determined by present data ; @xmath147 the _ joint _ information coming from the energy spectrum data ( superkamiokande ) and from the fourier transform of the solar neutrino rates ( superkamiokande , borexino ) can provide powerful tests of the vacuum oscillation solutions . besides , we have generalized the fourier transform formalism to three - flavor oscillations , and we have discussed a useful check of the time symmetry of the signal .",
