    "the estimation of cosmological parameters has reached an unprecedented level of accuracy since the new data on the cosmic microwave background @xcite,@xcite used in combination with other cosmological observations , such as the snia and galaxy cluster surveys .",
    "recent results show that matter contribution to the total density of the universe is mainly composed of non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "supersymmetric theories generally predict this yet still not observed and mostly non - interacting matter to be composed of wimps , which best motivated candidate is the neutralino @xcite .",
    "many collaborations have developped promising detectors to hunt actively non - baryonic dark matter candidates .",
    "these new detectors have reached significant sensitivity to begin to test regions of the susy parameter space compatible with accelerator and cosmological constraints and improved the upper limits on scalar and axial interaction exclusion plots @xcite . direct detection experiments present common problems such as neutron interaction and radioactive contamination of both sensitive medium and surrounding materials . since early experimental works @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , a superfluid detector has been proposed @xcite for direct detection of non - baryonic dark matter search .",
    "monte carlo simulations have shown that a high granularity detector , a matrix of superfluid cells , would allow to reach a high rejection factor against background events , leading to a low false neutralino event rate .",
    "at ultra - low temperature ( @xmath0 100 @xmath1k ) , is a very interesting medium since it could be used as a highly sensitive bolometer . as a matter of fact , around 100 @xmath1k and at low pressure , is in its superfluid b phase which has an extremely small quasiparticle gap .",
    "the use of superfluid -b is motivated by its very appealing features compared to other materials  : +    *   being a 1/2 spin nucleus , will be mainly sensitive to axial interaction , making this detector complementary to existing ones , mainly sensitive to the scalar interaction .",
    "the axial interaction is largely dominant in all the susy region associated with a substantial elastic cross - section @xcite . *",
    "an ultra - high purity due to its superfluid phase , only   can be dissolved in superfluid   but in an extremely low fraction @xcite . * a high neutron capture cross - section ( @xmath210 barns for 10 kev neutrons ) , implying a clear signature well discriminated from a wimp signal .",
    "* low compton cross - section .",
    "no intrinsic x - rays . * a low detection threshold , less than 1 kev . * a high signal to noise ratio , due to the small energy range expected for a wimp signal .",
    "the maximum recoil energy does only slightly depend on the wimp mass , given that the target nucleus ( @xmath3 ) is much lighter than the incoming @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", the recoil energy range needs to be studied only below @xmath6 , see @xcite .",
    "mache3 project will consist of a 10 kg matrix composed of 1000 cells of 125 @xmath7 filled with superfluid at 100 @xmath8k .",
    "a privileged design is shown on figure  [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "it is based on a hexagonal matrix with a close to a bee nest configuration .",
    "each cylinder is divided in 10 lancaster type @xcite cylindric bolometer cells .",
    "rejection principle relies on the energy release measurement and the correlation among the cells to discriminate background events ( neutrons , @xmath9-rays and muons ) from neutralino signal .",
    "it allows to reject background events given the fact that a wimp fires only one cell with an energy release below 6 kev .",
    "the high granularity combined with energy deposit allows to obtain relatively good rejection as seen on figure  [ fig : rejection ] . for 2.6 mev gammas ,",
    "only one over 5000 mimicks a wimp event , meaning that 99.98% are rejected . concerning neutrons ,",
    "we benefit from the high neutron capture cross - section .",
    "the capture process , @xmath10 , releases 764 kev in one cell .",
    "it allows to reach a very good rejection , 99.90% of 1 mev neutrons are rejected @xcite . in underground environnement , the false event rate is estimated to be less than @xmath210@xmath11 day@xmath11 for neutrons and @xmath210@xmath12 day@xmath11 for muons @xcite .      the elementary component of mache3 is the superfluid cell @xcite .",
    "an experimental test of a small prototype cell has been done with a lead shielding around the cryostat to estimate the contribution of the external natural radioactivity .",
    "the cell was a copper cylindric box ( @xmath13 ) filled with superfluid around 100 @xmath14 .",
    "the detection principle relies on the damping on the vibrating wire resonance .",
    "more precisely , the vibration amplitude decreases when a particle interacts inside the cell .",
    "the thermal diffusion is done through the hole .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "stability in temperature for one week per cycle at t @xmath15 and detection threshold around 1 kev have been obtained .",
    "an experiment with an am - be neutron source has been performed to validate the response of the cell to neutron irradiation .",
    "the capture has been observed @xcite .",
    "a 14% of the total energy released by the capture is lost in scintillation and vortex production . to disentangle these effects , development of a new prototype cell with an additional signal from the temperature change of the cell walls",
    "is in progress .",
    "the detection of cosmic muons during 12 hours has been highlighted as displayed on figure  [ fig : detection ] .",
    "experimental data exhibits a peak at 52 kev .",
    "a geant4 @xcite simulation reproducing the experimental set - up has been developped to estimate the released energy by 2 gev muons crossing through the cell .",
    "simulation presents a clear peak at 67 kev . a shift compared with expectation value",
    "is observed .",
    "the energy loss may be related to uv photon emission and vortex formation @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological study has been done with the darksusy code @xcite , to test performance of mache3 and its complementarity with existing detectors within the framework of a phenomenological supersymmetric model .",
    "a scan on a large range of all free parameters has been done , corresponding to a total number of @xmath16 models .",
    "accelerator constraints as well as cosmological ones have been considered @xcite .    using the darksusy code ,",
    "the @xmath4  -   axial cross - section has been evaluated .",
    "the @xmath4   event rate has then been evaluated for a @xmath17 matrix , to be compared with the background rate @xcite .",
    "a large number of models are giving a rate higher than the estimated false event rate induced by neutrons ( @xmath18 ) , or above the estimated muon background ( @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 background level ( @xmath20 ) is chosen as the lowest reachable limit for mache3 .",
    "models giving a rate higher than the @xmath8 background are selected .",
    "figure  [ fig : susy ] shows how they are distributed in the scalar cross section on proton neutralino mass diagram .",
    "dama region is displayed as well as exclusion curves from edelweiss and cdms and their projections .",
    "it can be seen that many susy models lie below the projected limits of future scalar detectors ( edelweiss @xcite , cdms @xcite ) , while giving an event rate above the value taken as the lowest reachable limit for mache3 .",
    "detection principle and cosmic muon detection in the elementary component of our matrix has been shown .",
    "background rejection has been presented .",
    "it has been highlighted that a @xmath21 high granularity detector ( mache3 ) would allow to obtain , in many susy models , a @xmath4 event rate higher than the estimated background .",
    "mache3 would thus potentially allow to reach a large part of the susy region , not excluded by current collider limits and projection limit of runing detectors .",
    "an experiment on a multicell prototype as seen on figure  [ fig : prototype ] devoted to validate correlation among the cells for background rejection is in progress .",
