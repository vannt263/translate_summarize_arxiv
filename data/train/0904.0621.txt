    "<S> the beam patterns produced by displaced slot elements form a set of basis functions in which the image - plane field distribution can be expanded and the necessary beam formation can be achieved .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we will study limitations on subwavelength imaging imposed by discrete nature of the considered sources . </S>",
    "<S> we will establish a theorem in the space domain that can be seen as an analogy of the well - known kotelnikov ( nyquist - shannon ) sampling theorem in the time domain  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will also outline a possible realization of an imaging system operating exactly on the resolution limit enforced by this theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with considering an infinite planar array of high - frequency line currents in free space . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a cartesian coordinate system with the @xmath0-axis oriented along the currents and the @xmath1-axis perpendicular to the array plane . in these </S>",
    "<S> coordinates the currents are at points @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the period of the array and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the complex amplitudes of the currents are yet unknown , let us denote them @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> then the total electric field at the point @xmath7 produced by this array of currents reads : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 ; the time dependence is of form @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us impose the following condition on the electric field at the plane @xmath12 ( image plane ) : @xmath13 the respective array and the image plane are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ array ] .    physically , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : condition ] ) mean that we would like to concentrate the field at the image plane around point @xmath14 and at the same time have it completely vanishing at discrete points @xmath15 , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> next , we will look for such a distribution of currents that satisfies ( [ eq : condition ] ) .    considering a fourier series with the discrete currents @xmath6 as its coefficients </S>",
    "<S> one can write @xmath17 where @xmath18 is yet unknown function . substituting ( [ eq : fourier ] ) into ( [ eq : field ] ) we obtain @xmath19    next , using the poisson summation formula @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a quickly converging series ; the branch of the square root in ( [ eq : poisson ] ) is such that @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    from ( [ eq : derivation ] ) and ( [ eq : poisson ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath25 from ( [ eq : final ] ) and the condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) it immediately follows that @xmath26 finally , sustituting ( [ eq : solution ] ) into ( [ eq : fourier ] ) we get the complex amplitudes of the currents : @xmath27 where we have introduced the function @xmath28 that we will call _ elementary wavelet_. in terms of it , condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath29 now we can formulate a couple of lemmas .    for any given electric field distribution @xmath30 defined at discrete points @xmath31 in the image plane there </S>",
    "<S> exists a distribution of line currents defined at the points @xmath31 in the source plane that produces exactly the given electric field distribution . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath33 form a complete system of linearly independent functions on an infinite set of discrete points so that any given distribution of line currents @xmath6 can be uniquely expanded into wavelet series @xmath34 [ lemma2 ]    the proof of this lemma is given in appendix .    now from the above lemmas we can conclude that the distribution of the field produced by a planar periodic array of discrete sources is completely determined by the values of the same field taken at corresponding discrete points in any plane parallel to the array plane . indeed , knowing the discrete values of the field one can reconstruct the currents in the source plane with the help of lemma [ lemma1 ] and </S>",
    "<S> then calculate the field at any point of space using  ( [ eq : field ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> lemma [ lemma2 ] makes sure that the source distribution found in this way is unique .    </S>",
    "<S> having said that we arrive at the following theorem which is in a sense analogous to the kotelnikov sampling theorem .    the electric field of the considered planar periodic array of line currents is completely determined by the values of the same field taken at certain discrete points in any plane parallel to the array plane and can be represented by the following formula : @xmath35    as said above </S>",
    "<S> , this formula is the result of substitution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : expansion1 ] ) into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : field ] ) .    from this theorem </S>",
    "<S> we see that it is impossible to produce _ arbitrary _ near - field distributions with an array of currents of a given period . </S>",
    "<S> the set of realizable distributions is determined by ( [ eq : theorem ] ) and is , basically , a set of linear combinations of the fields created by the wavelets of currents ( [ eq : expansion ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the structure period sets a limit on the amount of details that one can expect to observe in a near - field image . </S>",
    "<S> although this fact is rather physically intuitive and has been mentioned in the literature before , the above theorem makes it explicit in mathematical terms .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss some properties of the introduced wavelet functions . </S>",
    "<S> the elementary wavelet is given by  ( [ eq : waveletdef ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the period of the array is small compared to the wavelength and the parameter @xmath36 is large enough , the series @xmath21 converges very rapidly , so that only a few first terms of the series should be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for @xmath37 and @xmath38 it is enough to take only 3 terms of the series .    </S>",
    "<S> example plots of the normalized elementary wavelets for two cases with different values of the parameters are given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ waveletfig](a ,  b ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the normalized @xmath28 is practically purely imaginary , as the real part of it approaches zero for @xmath37 and @xmath38 . on the plot there </S>",
    "<S> are also shown the distribution of current magnitudes of the source introduced by merlin @xcite : @xmath39 and the distribution that we can obtain from our formulas when only a single term of the series ( [ eq : poisson ] ) with @xmath40 is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that when @xmath41 the source proposed by merlin can be seen as a one - term approximation of our formulas . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is valid only for small @xmath42 because @xmath28 decays quicker ( exponentially ) when @xmath43 .    </S>",
    "<S> the field distribution in the image plane is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ waveletfig](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this function reminds of @xmath44 , however for large arguments it decays quicker ( exponentially ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the width of the near - field peak at zero level is @xmath45 , as expected .    </S>",
    "<S> next we would like to consider how the introduced wavelets ( which are certain distributions of line currents ) can be physically realized . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to represent a two - dimensional array of line currents with a grid of thin wires illuminated by an incident plane wave . as we would like to excite currents with alternating phases on the neighboring wires ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ waveletfig](a , b ) ) it is natural to load the wires with alternating reactive loads , so that the effective wire impedances and wire currents will change from wire to wire in the necessary way . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the scheme proposed in @xcite we would like to separate the creation of the phase profile of the currents from the amplitude profile . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the characteristic scale of the amplitude profile @xmath46 can be much larger than the phase change scale @xmath4 . in the example given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ waveletfig](a ) these scales differ by 10 times , so that the phase scale can be subwavelength while the amplitude scale is not . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is more practical to realize the amplitude profile with the conventional optical means by shaping the incident beam with diaphragms and/or lenses , while the phase profile can be realized with wire loading .    as a proof of concept </S>",
    "<S> let us calculate the interaction field and the local field in a wire array with currents distributed proportionally to @xmath28 : @xmath47 $ ] for the case depicted in fig .  [ waveletfig](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction field at the @xmath48-th wire is @xmath49 given the incident field @xmath50 the local field acting on the @xmath48-th wire can be expressed as @xmath51 as we discussed above , we realize the necessary amplitude profile of the currents by shaping the incident field accordingly , so that @xmath52 therefore , the total effective impedance ( including the self - impedance and loading ) per unit length of the @xmath48-th wire has to be @xmath53 the phase of the first term in ( [ eq : ztot ] ) is alternating from wire to wire while its magnitude remains constant . moreover , if @xmath54 is chosen to be in phase with @xmath55 then this impedance term is practically purely reactive ( imaginary ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the second term on wire index is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ waveletfig](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the real part of this term is constant and equals the radiation resistance of a single wire . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for the self - impedance of a thin wire of radius @xmath56 we have @xcite @xmath57 $ ] , where @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> another important property of it seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ waveletfig](b ) is that the imaginary part is also practically constant with  @xmath48   and @xmath38 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for the chosen parameters it happens to be very close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in a real array of wires we can neglect the small difference in this part of the impedance and load _ all _ wires by loads of only two kinds , to account for alternating reactance of the constant magnitude in the first term of @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> when compared to @xcite this greatly simplifies the structure . moreover , our loaded wire grid is periodic with the period @xmath45 , therefore if the beam illuminating the array moves along @xmath60-axis by an integral number of periods , the subwavelength spot produced by the array will also move by the same number of periods . </S>",
    "<S> this important property is missing in the realizations proposed in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , in this letter we have formulated a theorem on subwavelength imaging which is in a sense analogous to the kotelnikov sampling theorem . in the process of derivation of this theorem we solved a problem about a distribution of currents in a two - dimensional array that produces a given subwavelegth near - field spot . </S>",
    "<S> the found distribution of line currents represents an elementary source wavelet . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the source proposed in @xcite can be understood as a one - term approximation of the elementary wavelet derived in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that if the necessary amplitude profile of the currents is realized by shaping the incident field by conventional optical means the remaining phase profile can be produced with a grid of thin wires loaded by reactive loads of only two kinds . when compared to structures considered by other authors </S>",
    "<S> such a periodically loaded wire grid appears to be much simpler to realize . </S>"
