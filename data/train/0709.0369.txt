    "the small mass of the pion , in comparison to that of the vector mesons , suggests that the pion is a collective state of @xmath4 configurations , with many values of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore it is something of a riddle that it is possible to describe the empirical charge form factors of the charged pions satisfactorily with phenomenological wave functions under the assumption that they are pure quark - antiquark states @xcite .",
    "it is then a natural question to ask whether the empirical pion charge form factors can exclude the presence of the expected multiquark configurations in the pion .",
    "the negative parity of the pion requires that in the simplest sea - quark configuration , @xmath0 , at most 3 of the constituents can be in the ground state and that either one of the quarks or one of the antiquarks is raised to the @xmath6state ( or a higher odd@xmath7state ) .",
    "as this is energetically unfavorable it suggests that the probability of that configuration may be small in comparison to that of the @xmath8 component .",
    "the situation is analogous to that in baryons , for which positive parity requires that in a @xmath9 admixture either one of the quarks or the antiquark has to be in the @xmath6state @xcite .    here",
    "the charge form factor of the ( charged ) pion is calculated in an extension of the constituent quark model to include admixtures of the simplest sea - quark configurations @xmath0 in instant form kinematics .",
    "the calculation is made both for the case where one of the quarks and where one of the antiquarks is in the @xmath6state .",
    "it is in both cases found that inclusion of the sea - quark configuration allows a good description of the empirical form factor , even if it represents as much as half of the wave function .",
    "the main point is however , that as soon as there is a non vanishing probability for the sea quark component in the wave function , that component will lead to the dominant contribution to the charge form factor at large values of momentum transfer in the case of instant form kinematics . as a consequence",
    "the fact that it is possible to achieve a quantitatively satisfactory fit to the empirical charge form factor with wave function model for the conventional @xmath8 component alone does not rule out the presence of significant sea - quark components in the pion .",
    "the method of calculating the charge form factor in the constituent quark model with instant form kinematics developed here can readily be extended to sea - quark configurations with larger numbers of sea - quark @xmath8 components .",
    "the configurations of the @xmath0 system that are possible in the pion are described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 contains a description of the pion wave function and the different form factor contributions .",
    "the calculated results for the pion charge form factor are given in section 4 .",
    "finally section 5 contains a summarizing discussion .",
    "the lightest @xmath0 component in the pion meson contains only the light flavor quarks @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which form the fundamental representation of the @xmath12 flavor symmetry .",
    "the flavor - spin - color configurations of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 are listed in table [ qqqq ] by their young patterns .",
    ".the flavor - spin - color configurations of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 pairs . [ qqqq ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the calculated result for the @xmath1 charge form factor",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ pform ] for the case where both antiquarks are in the @xmath15state in the @xmath0 component .",
    "the result indicates that above 1 gev@xmath16 that with these parameters the main form factor contribution arises from the smaller @xmath0 component .",
    "that this should be so is in fact quite natural , as in the case of elastic form factors , the form factor falloff with momentum should depend on @xmath2 divided by the square of the number of involved constituents . in this case",
    "the contribution of the @xmath0 component is very small ( and in fact negative ) : -0.03 fm@xmath16 .",
    "the sign of this contribution depends on the parameter values .    the corresponding calculated results for the @xmath1 charge form factor for the case , where one of the antiquarks is in the @xmath6state are shown in fig .",
    "[ pformp ] .",
    "these results are in fact very similar to those obtained in the former case , where both antiquarks are in the @xmath15state , the main difference being a slightly larger magnitude for the contribution to the mean square radius from the @xmath0 component in the present case ( -0.04 fm@xmath16 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ pformalln ] the form factor is shown as obtained for different values of the probability for the @xmath0 component .",
    "these results were obtained by only slight variation of the 2 parameters in the wave function of the @xmath0 component ( [ owave4q ] ) .",
    "these results show that the present empirical data on the pion charge form factor can allow for a @xmath0 component probability of up to 50% .    for comparison the form factor that is obtained for the pure @xmath18 quark model for the pion",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ pform2q ] .",
    "these results were obtained with the constituent quark mass value 80 mev and with the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 mev in the @xmath8 wave function model ( [ owave2q ] ) .",
    "this shows that the pion charge form factor may be described with such a simple model wave function in instant form kinematics , a result that was noted for the case of front form kinematics in ref.@xcite .",
    "the results of this study shows that the present data for the charge form factor of the charged pions may described as well with inclusion of sea - quark configurations with probabilities up to least 50 % in the covariant constituent quark model with instant form kinematics as without such configurations .    when the sea - quark component is included in the form factor",
    ", that component will give the dominant contribution to the form factor at sufficiently large @xmath2 , which dominates over that from the @xmath18 component , however small its probability .",
    "the @xmath0 component corresponds to structures that have shorter range than the basic @xmath8 component .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[rho20 ] , where the charge density contributions from the @xmath8 and the @xmath0 components , along with their sum , is show for the case , in which the probability of the latter component is 20% . if the probability of the @xmath0 component is taken to be larger , the peak in the profile @xmath21 moves towards that of the @xmath8 component .",
    "the fact that the sea - quark contribution gives the largest contribution to the form factor at large values of momentum transfer is a consequence of the fact that the magnitude of the energy denominator in the expressions for the boost velocities for the constituents ( [ vboosts ] ) grows with the number of constituents .",
    "this implies that the momentum transfer is shared by the largest number of constituents , and in effect , to a smaller relative momentum transfer per constituent .",
    "as the form factor is a monotonically falling function of momentum transfer , the consequence is that the largest contribution at large @xmath2 is given by the component with the largest number of constituents .",
