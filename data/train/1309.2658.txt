    "be / x - ray binaries ( bexrbs ) are stellar systems in which a compact object , almost exclusively a neutron star , orbits a main sequence be star .",
    "these stars are rotating rapidly , causing an enhancement in the equatorial material which in turn , leads to hydrogen emission lines in the spectrum .",

    "the compact object orbits the primary in a highly eccentric orbit and accretes matter from the equatorial outflow .",
    "there are two types of outburst associated with the x - ray emission of bexrbs : type i outbursts have l@xmath8 in the range 10@xmath9 - 10@xmath10 erg  s@xmath1 and occur periodically around the time of the periastron passage of the neutron star .",

    ". a geometry in class iv is immediately ruled out as it requires the blackbody flux to be constant .",
    "similarly , the out of phase pulsations of the power law ( interpreted as the accretion column ) and the blackbody suggests we can also rule rule out a geometry in class i , if the accretion column is located just above the neutron star surface since it will always be eclipsed by the neutron star .",
    "the results from the fitting suggest that we are seeing both of the neutron star poles during a rotation of the neutron star with best - fit values for the angles of ( @xmath45,@xmath82)=(53,70 ) with a @xmath62 of 4.32 for 8 dof .",
    "a soft excess is a common feature in the x - ray spectra of bexrbs .",
    "it is hypothesised that a soft excess is in fact present in all bexrb spectra , though not always detected due to the high intrinsic absorption and flux of some sources .",
    "it is thought to originate from the inner radius of an accretion disc surrounding the neutron star @xcite , however the majority of the blackbody temperatures reported are a factor @xmath9010 lower than that found here ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature and flux of the blackbody component detected in this observation of swift  j045106.8 - 694803 ( @xmath91  kev , @xmath92  erg  @xmath61  s@xmath1 ) along with a distance to the lmc of @xmath93  kpc @xcite implies a blackbody radius of @xmath94=0.5@xmath30.2  km , calculated using the formula @xmath95 .",
    "all errors represent the 90% confidence limits .",
    "this is less than the radius of a neutron star and so emission from the entire accretion disc is clearly not the origin of this excess .    in the last 10 years",
    "a smaller subset of hmxbs have been discovered which are reported to have a `` hot '' ( @xmath96  kev ) thermal excess ( see table [ tab : bex ] ) .",
    "these all have @xmath971  km , suggesting emission from the neutron star polar cap .",
    "interestingly these systems are characterised by long pulse periods ( p>100  s ) and persistent x - ray emission , much like swift  j045106.8 - 694803 .",
    "could this be a selection effect ?",
    "the ability to detect pulsations in a given observation decreases with increasing pulse period .",
    "this could lead to observers requesting longer observations of the longer pulse period pulsars and thus having an greater number of counts in the source spectrum .",
    "this in turn would allow fainter spectral components to be detected .",
    "however , there are several pulsars with both short and long periods that have been observed with a similar or greater number of total counts than seen here which have not shown any evidence for this spectral component ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for recent examples with _ xmm _ ) .",
    "as such we conclude that this can not solely be an observational bias .    thermal emission",
    "is often observed to have the greatest contribution to the soft energy band .",
    "this does not appear to be the case in the spectrum of swift  j045106.8 - 694803 , as the blackbody component contributes @xmath98% of the total flux of the source at energies @xmath99  kev .",
    "lomb - scargle analysis of the 4.5 - 10.0 kev light curve shows no evidence for pulsations , which seems to contradict the hypothesis that the thermal emission originates from the polar cap .",
    "however , simulations of the spectrum s model components suggest that the lack of pulsations is the result of the two components pulsating out phase .",
    "figure [ fig : minmax ] shows the `` hard '' and `` soft '' spectra of swift  j045106.8 - 694803 . despite similar levels of variation in both components , the overall spectrum varies very little above @xmath100  kev .",
    "this reflects the results of the lomb - scargle analysis of the higher energy light curves and also explains the reduction in the pulsed fraction at higher energies , which is usually observed to increase with both increasing energy and decreasing source flux as the regions emitting the x - rays become more compact @xcite . above @xmath9010",
    "kev , the non - thermal component once again dominates the x - ray spectrum .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , then pulsations should once more be detectable at higher energies .",
    "the decomposition of the spectral components has allowed us to demonstrate how the geometry of the neutron star could be constrained should better data become available .",
    "the current values of @xmath45 and @xmath82 are approximate since we assumed a simple blackbody emission model .",
    "more sophisticated modelling is not warranted at this time given the relatively large uncertainties of the pulse profile .",
    "detailed modelling of deeper observations , with better signal - to - noise , could provide an independent measurement of the magnetic field ; furthermore , future polarization studies could even break the degeneracy between @xmath45 and @xmath82 .",
    "@xcite use the pulse period determined in this work along with data from _ swift _ and _ rxte _ to show that swift  j045106.8 - 694803 has a magnetic field above the quantum critical value .",
    "two other accreting pulsars are known with @xmath101 values consistent with a super stong magnetic field , 4u2206 + 54 @xcite and sxp  1062 @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , both of these sources are members of the hot thermal excess population ( see table [ tab : bex ] ) which suggests a possible link between these two phenomena ( although sxp  1062 is also surrounded by a supernova remnant with @xmath102  kev possibly adding to the thermal excess , @xcite ) .",
    "the link between the magnetic field and spin period of a neutron star is well known ( e.g. @xcite ) . for isolated pulsars ,",
    "the relationship is @xmath103 and is due to emission of magnetic dipole radiation . for accretion powered pulsars ,",
    "the torque experienced due to accretion is much stronger than the dipole spin down torque and the relationship is @xmath104 if the neutron star is spinning at its equilibrium period ( i.e. @xmath105 ) . if the neutron stars are not in spin equilibrium , the relationship is more complex ( e.g. @xcite @xmath106 ) .",
    "the `` standard '' relation for radio pulsars also links the neutron star polar cap size to its spin period , @xmath107 , i.e. longer period pulsars have small caps .",
    "if this is extended to the accretion powered pulsars , the relationships above suggest that higher magnetic fields would be found in pulsars with longer periods and imply smaller polar caps .",
    "we have presented detailed analysis of a recent _ xmm - newton _ too observation of the bexrb swift  j045106.8 - 694803 .",
    "the period was determined to be 168.5@xmath30.2  s as of mjd = 56125.0 .",
    "the pulsed fraction decreases with increasing energy , with no detection of the period at energies > 4.5  kev .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is adequately represented by two models , a single component continuum model ( an absorbed powerlaw ) and a two component continuum model ( an absorbed powerlaw and blackbody ) .",
    "the extra blackbody component , though just formally significant , is not necessary for an acceptable fit to the spectrum and the parameters of the _ phabs*vphabs*powerlaw _ model are consistent with those reported for other bexrbs .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain the dramatic decrease in the pulsations with increasing energy with a single component model . a two component model , with anticorrelated pulsations , can account for this behaviour and the anticorrelation of the hardness ratio and pulse profile and implies @xmath45 and @xmath82 values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the high temperature of the blackbody ( @xmath91  kev ) implies a radius of blackbody radius of @xmath6  km , and is attributed to the polar cap of the neutron star .",
    "this is not the first detection of a hot thermal excess in the x - ray spectra of hmxbs ( see table [ tab : bex ] for recent examples ) and interestingly swift  j045106.8 - 694803 shares common characteristics with these sources including persistent low level x - ray emission and a long pulse period ( p>100  s ) .",
    "if confirmed to be the latest member of this emerging class , it would be the brightest and shortest period source .",
    "interestingly , two of the other sources listed in table [ tab : bex ] also have high @xmath101 values , indicating a strong magnetic field .",
    "whilst based on a small sample , this could suggest that there is a link between a hot thermal excess and the magnetic field strength .",
    "further monitoring of the pulse periods of these sources as well as the temperatures of their thermal components could reveal if this is causal or coincidence .",
    "should the blackbody in swift  j045106.8 - 694803 exist , we predict that above 10  kev the pulse period should once more be detectable as the power law becomes the dominant component in the x - ray spectrum once again .    most of the known x - ray pulsars in the small and large magellanic cloud have been detected with _ rxte _ during a @xmath9010  yr monitoring campaign @xcite .",
    "_ rxte _ has a limited response below 2  kev and this particular pulsar , with its soft pulses and low level emission , would not have been detected unless it went into outburst .",
    "detailed analysis of the _ xmm _ survey of the smc @xcite could reveal a further population of these softly pulsating hmxbs .",
