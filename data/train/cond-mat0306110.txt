    "two decades ago , casati , chirikov and guarneri@xcite and berry@xcite have undertaken numerical and analytical studies of the level statistics in rectangular billiards for large quantum numbers ( semiclassical quantization ) .",
    "et al_@xcite demonstrated numerically that the distribution function of the nearest - neighbor energy level spacings is exponential ( obeys poisson law@xcite ) , which is generally the case for classically integrable systems and is well understood theoretically@xcite .",
    "further , they studied the behavior of the level rigidity@xcite in the spectral staircase and showed that , following the initial linear growth with the width of the interval , the rigidity saturates to a constant value .",
    "this behavior was explained by berry@xcite who argued that the width of the interval at which the saturation occurs corresponds to the shortest periodic orbit in the billiard and that the saturation value of the rigidity can be obtained as a sum over the periodic orbits .",
    "subsequently , the results of@xcite have been reproduced with high numerical precision in refs.@xcite and@xcite .    in the previous work@xcite",
    ", we set out to interpret this result in terms of the global level rigidity and , in particular , proposed an ansatz for the level density correlation function that successfully describes the transition from linear to saturation behavior and that is also similar , aside from the energy scale , to its counterparts in the gaussian ensembles ( classically chaotic systems)@xcite,@xcite .",
    "furthermore , our correlation function led us to believe that the variance should exhibit interesting , albeit decaying , oscillations on approach to its saturation value ( by the integral relationship@xcite between the rigidity and the variance - see below - it should be twice that of the rigidity ) .",
    "surprisingly , our numerical calculation indicated that the size of the oscillations of the variance does not decay with the increase of the width of the interval .",
    "further investigation of the level correlation function revealed that a more accurate treatment of large energy scales gives an analytical explanation which is in excellent agreement with the numerical results .",
    "it should be emphasized that the key difference of our numerical procedure relative to@xcite and@xcite is that we averaged over the ratio of the rectangle s sides , as opposed to averaging over the spectrum keeping a fixed ratio of the sides .",
    "indeed , both the onset of saturation and the saturation value scale as a square root of energy , that is depend critically on the position in the spectrum@xcite . consequently , averaging over the spectrum averages over these quantities .",
    "notice , for instance , that the plot of variance in@xcite does show oscillations .",
    "however , because of the averaging procedure , they appear to be decaying and of irregular pattern and did not receive due acknowledgment .",
    "we will consider intervals @xmath0 $ ] , @xmath1 , where the states with energies near @xmath2 have large quantum numbers and can be described semiclassically .",
    "we will denote @xmath3 the spectral staircase@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is unit step function and @xmath6 are energy eigenstates .",
    "more precisely , we will consider the 2d - reduced@xcite spectrum where the systematic energy dependence of @xmath3 has been eliminated due to boundary corrections @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; for a rectangle this dependence can be obtained directly@xcite,@xcite from the energy levels of a particle in a box , eq .",

    ", we make the substitution @xmath11 and , in particular , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ensemble average of @xmath14 ( in the limit of an infinitely large ensemble ) . with such definition of energy (",

    "the energy eigenvalues are @xmath22 and averaging is performed over the ",
    "@xmath9-ensemble ,  that is by sampling the values of @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the rectangle s sides , while keeping @xmath26 , and consequently @xmath27 , constant .",
    "numerically , we use algebraic numbers for @xmath9 to avoid accidental level degeneracies ( we do nt use transcendental numbers because they are too close to rational@xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we will not discuss the distribution of the nearest - neighbor energy level spacings , except to state that our computations@xcite are congruent with those of@xcite,@xcite and@xcite . here",
    ", we will study the correlations and fluctuations in the energy spectrum and , towards this end , the following measures will be used .",
    "first , it is the  level rigidity ",

    "1 shows an example of such a fit .    for the number of levels @xmath31 on the interval @xmath29 $ ] @xmath32 the variance",
    "@xmath33 is another measure of the fluctuations .",
    "clearly , @xmath34 for an infinitely large ensemble .    introducing the mean level spacing @xmath35 as @xmath36 we find that , due to the @xmath31-fluctuations @xmath37 over the intervals @xmath38 narrower than a certain energy scale , the following relationship holds@xcite @xmath39 for classically integrable billiards the latter holds for @xmath40 ( see below ) , so that we can neglect the difference between @xmath35 and @xmath41 only for sufficiently large intervals @xmath42 , in which case we can introduce the limiting value of mean level spacing (  global mean  ) as @xmath43 in what follows we will , unless mentioned otherwise , measure energies in units of @xmath44 ( wherein @xmath45 , as in eq .",
    "( [ cnav_reduced ] ) ) .",
    "general relationships can be established between the fluctuations measures and the correlation function of the level density@xcite , @xmath46 regardless of the specific form of @xmath47 , for instance , @xmath48 using these relationships one can further show that @xmath49 supersedes @xmath50 via an integral relationship@xcite @xmath51 which , again , does not depend on the particulars of the level statistics and level correlations in the semiclassical energy spectrum .    for gaussian ensembles , corresponding to classically chaotic ergodic systems ,",
    "the functional form of the level correlation function @xmath52 is well understood@xcite . denoting @xmath53",
    "we find that it can be written , in most general terms , as @xmath54   \\label{k_gauss}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 the interpretation of these formulas are as follows .",
    "the @xmath57-function term in ( [ k_gauss ] ) describes uncorrelated levels .",
    "the @xmath58-function describes  level repulsion  and has a scale of @xmath44 .",
    "the integrals ( [ int_ck ] ) and ( [ int_k ] ) converge to their values on the scale of @xmath59 and reflect the fact that an overall  level rigidity  develops on the scale of @xmath44 .    indeed , by definition of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and thus @xmath62 where integration is over the entire energy spectrum .",
    "the integral can be converted to the form ( [ int_k ] ) when , given a position in the spectrum @xmath63 , the scale on which the level rigidity ( [ level - rigidity ] ) develops is much smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "( [ k_gauss])-([int_k ] ) show that gaussian ensembles become rigid on the scale of @xmath44 .",
    "this fact can be also observed from the behavior of @xmath49 @xmath64 where the constant @xmath65 depends on the specifics of a gaussian ensemble@xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath28 , @xmath66 is then easily recovered from that of @xmath49 using ( [ delta3_vs_sigma ] ) .",
    "notice that the linear terms in eqs .",
    "( [ sigma_gauss-1 ] ) and ( [ delta3_gauss-1 ] ) originate in the @xmath57-function term in ( [ k_gauss ] ) ( uncorrelated levels ) .    in the semiclassical approach",
    ", @xmath60 is an oscillatory term that can be written as a sum over all periodic orbits@xcite .",
    "berry@xcite used this approach to obtain the following limiting behaviors of @xmath67 for the rectangular box : @xmath68 where the second term gives the  saturation rigidity  @xmath69 and @xmath70 here @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the  winding numbers  of the classical periodic orbits@xcite and the factor @xmath73 differentiates between the self - retracing and non - self - retracing orbits .",
    "notice that both @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the functions of the position @xmath63 in the spectrum ( @xmath76 ) , which is in stark contrast with gaussian ensembles .",
    "the quantum scale @xmath75 for the onset of saturation corresponds to the time of traversal of the shortest classical periodic orbit @xcite , @xmath77 whose length is just twice the length of the rectangle s smaller side and the winding numbers are @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "notice that saturation of @xmath28 to @xmath80 in a rectangle , eqs.([delta3_rectangle-1 ] ) and ( [ delta3_rectangle-2 ] ) , is analogous to  saturation  of @xmath28 to the weak logarithmic dependence for a gaussian ensemble , eqs .",
    "( [ delta3_gauss-1 ] ) and ( [ delta3_gauss-2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , one should expect the level density correlation function for a rectangular box to have the form similar to ( [ k_gauss ] ) , except that the scale of @xmath58 is set by @xmath81 .",
    "indeed , in our previous work@xcite we introduced a simple ansatz that resulted in the following expression for @xmath82 : @xmath83   \\label{k_rectangle - ansatz}\\ ] ] in this form , @xmath84 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ int_k ] ) and is , thus , consistent with the level rigidity developing on the scale of @xmath75 .",
    "evaluation of @xmath28 using eq .",
    "( [ k_rectangle - ansatz ] ) successfully reproduces saturation to @xmath74 on this scale also . for @xmath49 , eq .",
    "( [ k_rectangle - ansatz ] ) predicts@xcite eventual saturation to @xmath85 , but in an oscillatory fashion @xmath86 ( the oscillatory term does not contribute to @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ delta3_vs_sigma ] ) ) .",
    "while successfully describing the onset of the level rigidity and the oscillations of @xmath49 on the scales @xmath87 , the ansatz ( [ k_rectangle - ansatz ] ) does not capture the correct behavior of @xmath49 on scales @xmath88 .",
    "the central result of this work is that the magnitude of the oscillations around @xmath89 is not decaying and that the onset of the level rigidity on the scale of @xmath75 is not , in fact , precise .",
    "this will be shown both numerically and analytically , the latter being based on a more careful analysis of the level correlation function obtained , alternatively , either semiclassically or by the direct use of the explicit form of the level spectrum in the rectangular box .",
    "the analytical expression for the level density correlation function , in the form of the infinite sum , can be obtained in two ways .",
    "first , it can be recovered from the semiclassical derivation of berry in ref.@xcite , as per eqs .",
    "( 23 ) , ( 38 ) , ( 58 ) , and ( 60 ) there . indeed , taking the inverse fourier",
    "transform in the last of these equations , we find @xmath90 _",
    "{ \\alpha \\sim 1 }   \\label{k_rect - apha_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the paragraph following eq .",
    "( 38 ) in@xcite explains the nature of the factor @xmath91 in the above equation ; our interpretation is that the factor of @xmath92 is the intensity factor due to constructive interference between the closed orbit and its time - reversed for non - self - retracing orbits ( both @xmath71 and @xmath72 are non - zero ) .",
    "the latter is crucial for understanding of the change in level correlations due to time - reversal symmetry breaking ( for instance , by a magnetic field ) .",
    "alternatively , one can obtain ( [ k_rectangle ] ) starting directly from eqs .",
    "( [ rho ] ) and ( [ enm ] ) . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "such a formalism was developed for @xmath93 and was generalized to @xmath94 in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is based on the use of the poisson summation formula , whose net effect is to convert the sum over actual levels to the sum over classical periodic orbits .",
    "formally , it is accomplished@xcite,@xcite by converting the sum on @xmath95 to the sum on @xmath96 of the fourier transforms and by neglecting the rapidly oscillating terms , that is harmonic terms whose arguments depend on @xmath63 and change by @xmath97 when @xmath98 change by @xmath99 . as a result one recovers not @xmath100 .",
    "also , we are presently investigating if the coefficient @xmath101 is properly recovered with this technique.]@xcite eq .",
    "( [ k_rectangle ] ) .",
    "notice that in the limit of @xmath102 , the summation over @xmath103 can be replaced by integration over @xmath104 in the entire plane , where @xmath105 converting to polar coordinates , we find @xmath106 that is the first term in eq .",
    "( [ k_rectangle - ansatz ] ) .",
    "notice , however , that in reality the lower limit of @xmath107-integration should not extend to zero since @xmath108 are not simultaneously zero .",
    "the second ( repulsion ) term in eq .",
    "( [ k_rectangle - ansatz ] ) is then obtained using the ansatz@xcite in which the lower cut - off in @xmath109 is chosen at @xmath110 .    in the opposite limit @xmath102 ,",
    "the terms in the series ( [ k_rectangle ] ) become rapidly oscillating with the amplitude rapidly decreasing with the increase of the winding numbers . consequently",
    ", the sum will be dominated by a just few terms with the smallest @xmath108 .",
    "the latter is the reason behind the non - decaying oscillations of @xmath49 that will be discussed below .",
    "combining eqs . ( [ sigma_integral ] ) and ( [ k_rectangle ] ) , we find @xmath111 _",
    "{ \\alpha \\sim 1 }   \\label{sigma_rect - alpha_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for narrow intervals , eq .",
    "( [ sigma_rectangle ] ) reduces to @xmath112 which follows either from eqs .",
    "( [ sigma_integral ] ) and ( [ k_rectangle - limit ] ) or directly from ( [ sigma_rectangle ] ) if summation is replaced with integration using variables ( [ xy_variables ] ) .",
    "it is also consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ delta3_vs_sigma ] ) and ( [ delta3_rectangle-1 ] ) .",
    "2 shows the result of evaluation of @xmath49 using eq .",
    "( [ sigma_rectangle ] ) ( with the upper limit of summation on @xmath108 limited to @xmath113 ) versus the numerical evaluation of @xmath49 for the ensemble of @xmath114 algebraic @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "we also show @xmath49 obtained using the ansatz ( [ k_rectangle - ansatz ] ) of ref.@xcite@xmath116 clearly , the latter adequately describes the transition from the small - scale @xmath117 linear behavior ( [ sigma_rectangle-1 ] ) to scales of @xmath118 , but fails to describe the large - scale behavior,@xmath119 .",
    "on the other hand , the agreement of numerical evaluation with the theoretical result ( [ sigma_rectangle ] ) for all @xmath38 is quite remarkable .",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "first , it was necessary to have a sufficient spread of @xmath9-values ( between @xmath99 and @xmath120 here ) to obtain reliable statistics for large quantum numbers with relatively small @xmath9-ensembles ( @xmath121 values here ) .",
    "however , the dependence on @xmath9 of the relevant parameters is quite weak , through @xmath122 , so for @xmath123 $ ] the difference from an ensemble whose @xmath124-values would be close to a fixed value ( @xmath99 in this particular case ) is not significant .",
    "second , for @xmath125 it is sufficient to limit summation on @xmath108 to @xmath120 and @xmath126 in the double and single sum respectively to obtain a curve which is very close to the full theoretical curve ; as was already explained above this is because the amplitudes of the quickly oscillating terms in the sum rapidly fall off with the increase of @xmath98 .",
    "we now turn to the theoretical curve in fig .",
    "3 that represents the level number variance given by ( [ sigma_rect - alpha_1 ] ) .",
    "it is intended to describe the @xmath9-ensemble such that @xmath127 and it can be effectively reproduced by the superposition of only @xmath128 harmonics : @xmath126 from the double some and @xmath129with commensurate frequencies ) from the single sum .",
    "these are non - decaying oscillations whose amplitude is given by @xmath130 where @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath89 is the mean value of oscillating @xmath49 which is obtained by substituting @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( [ sigma_rectangle ] ) .",
    "the small asymmetry of the positive and negative swings of @xmath49-oscillations , @xmath134 , is due to the asymmetry of the clausen function@xcite @xmath135 , @xmath136 for which @xmath137 .",
    "this function originates in the single sum in eq .",
    "( [ sigma_rect - alpha_1 ] ) , which corresponds to self - retracing orbits .",
    "it is important to point out that if one averages over the range of @xmath9-values , or over the range of @xmath2-values@xcite , the beats that result from a superposition of a continuous range of harmonics will present themselves , over relevant interval widths , as decaying oscillations .",
    "this is due to the corresponding continuous range of the beat frequencies represented by their envelopes .",
    "we now turn to breaking of time reversal symmetry for charged particles due to a magnetic field .",
    "clearly , the condition for the latter is given by @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the flux quantum .",
    "for such fields , the larmor radius is much greater than either side of the rectangle @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , the deviation from the free specular scattering will be small and we can find both the level correlation function and the level number variance via simple substitution @xmath142 in eqs .",
    "( [ k_rectangle ] ) and ( [ sigma_rectangle ] ) . for the @xmath143-ensemble",
    "considered above , @xmath144 is shown in fig .",
    "4 . in this case @xmath145 the increased asymmetry of @xmath49-oscillations underscores the increased relative contribution of the single sum to @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ sigma_rect - alpha_1 ] ) ( self - retracing orbits ) .",
    "the central results of this work are summarized by figs . 2 - 4 .",
    "the first of these graphs shows that the numerical evaluation of the level number variance for a particle in a rectangular box is in excellent agreement with the theoretical result given by eq .",
    "( [ sigma_rectangle ] ) .",
    "the second indicates a non - decaying oscillatory behavior of @xmath49 .",
    "the third shows @xmath146 when the time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "figs . 3 and 4 can be successfully reproduced with just a small number of lowest harmonics in ( [ sigma_rect - alpha_1 ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that , given the center of the interval @xmath2 , @xmath147 exhibits large , reproducible oscillations as a function of the interval width @xmath38 .",
    "the main implication of this result is that while the level rigidity indeed develops on the scale set by @xmath148 , it is accurate only in an approximation where a harmonic is replaced by its average - zero . in other words , ( [ int_k ] )",
    "converges to zero on the scale of @xmath149 only up to a sum of harmonic terms , as implied by eq .",
    "( [ k_rectangle ] ) .",
    "we point out that @xmath49-oscillations are entirely consistent with the near straight line saturation of @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , @xmath28 also exhibit oscillatory behavior around @xmath80 , but it is both parametrically small in @xmath150 and decays as a function of @xmath151 .",
    "this reduction of @xmath28 can be traced , for instance , to integration in eq .",
    "( [ delta3_vs_sigma ] ) .    in the future",
    ", we will investigate the level number variance in a variety of finite - domain and potential problems .",
    "we will also address the explicit dependence of the level correlation function on the magnetic field for a detailed description of the time - reversal breaking transition and to address the orbital magnetism of non - resonant integrable systems .",
    "we are grateful to bernie goodman for numerous discussions and insightful comments .",
