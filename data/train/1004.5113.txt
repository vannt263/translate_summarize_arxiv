    "in this paper we study the relation between the bfkl perturbative resummation of leading logarithms @xcite at high energy and the jimwlk / klwmij evolution @xcite,@xcite equations , which take into account the physics of saturation and multiple scatterings @xcite . with a slight abuse of language we call bfkl the second quantized formulation which leads not only to the bfkl equation for two gluon exchange , but also to the whole set of bkp equations for @xmath0-channel exchanges with an arbitrary number of gluons @xcite .",
    "the basic correspondence between the elements of the two approaches was established in @xcite and we will review it briefly below .    here",
    "we are interested in the question how to relate the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the bfkl hamiltonian and their counterparts in the jimwlk / klwmij theory .",
    "we will show that the eigenfunctions of the jimwlk / klwmij hamiltonians when expanded in taylor series in the appropriate variable ( @xmath2 for jimwlk and @xmath3 for klwmij ) are eigenfunctions of the bfkl hamiltonian .",
    "however most of the bfkl eigenfunctions when resummed into solutions of jimwlk / klwmij are not normalizable . the question which are , and which are not , can not be settled within the bfkl framework .",
    "we also discuss how to calculate higher corrections to the bfkl eigenfunctions . as an example we concentrate on the reggeized gluon @xcite .",
    "we calculate corrections to the reggeized gluon wave function .",
    "we show that terms with up to two gluons in the @xmath0-channel reggeize due to the bootstrap condition inherent in this approach .",
    "we also point out that in the jimwlk / klwmij framework the bootstrap is a necessary consequence of the hermiticity of the jimwlk / klwmij hamiltonian , and does not require a specific form of the emission kernel .",
    "we calculate corrections to the eigenfunction beyond the two gluon exchange approximation and thereby find the screening correction which appears when at least three gluons are exchanged in the @xmath0-channel .",
    "this is an interesting example of the interrelation between the @xmath0-channel unitarity , which is the origin of reggeons and the @xmath1-channel one which is the inherent feature of the jimwlk / klwmij approach .",
    "let us start by recapitulating the jimwlk / klwmij formalism .",
    "in this approach one considers the scattering of a projectile hadron on a hadronic target .",
    "the projectile is described by a distribution of color charge density in the transverse plane @xmath4 , while the target is viewed as an ensemble of the color fields @xmath5 with probability densities @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] respectively .",
    "the second quantized @xmath8 matrix operator is given by its eikonal expression ( see ) @xmath9 and the forward @xmath8 matrix element at rapidity @xmath10 is given by the functional integral @xmath11\\,\\,w^t[\\alpha_t ] \\,\\exp\\left\\{i\\int_{0}^{1 } dy^-\\int d^2x\\,\\rho_p^a(x , y^-)\\,\\alpha_t^a(x , y^-)\\right\\}\\ ] ]    the @xmath8 matrix in the jimwkl approach with averaging specified by . ]    the rapidity evolution of basic physical observables ( including the @xmath8-matrix ) is determined by the second quantized evolution hamiltonian @xmath12 ( the following pertains to the projectile evolution - we drop the subscript on @xmath2 for brevity ) @xmath13=h_{rft}[\\rho , \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\rho}]w[\\rho]\\ ] ] the evolution hamiltonian @xmath12 depends on two unitary matrices , @xmath14 here the field @xmath15 is the projectile color field analogous to @xmath16 .",
    "it is related by a nonlinear transformation to the projectile color charge density @xmath2 @xmath17 with @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19    the @xmath8-matrix at arbitrary rapidity can therefore be represented in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath12 .",
    "its evolution is given by @xmath20w_y^p[\\rho]\\,\\,w^t[\\alpha_t ] \\,\\exp\\left\\{i\\int_{0}^{1 } dy^-\\int d^2x\\,\\rho^a(x , y^-)\\,\\alpha_t^a(x , y^-)\\right\\}\\ ] ]    given the set of complete eigenfunctionals of @xmath12 @xmath21=\\omega_i\\psi_i[\\rho]\\ ] ] one can expand the probability distribution at the initial rapidity @xmath22 as @xmath23=\\sum_i\\gamma_i\\psi_i[\\rho]\\ ] ] and therefore @xmath24 with @xmath25\\,\\,w^t[\\alpha_t ] \\,\\exp\\left\\{i\\int_{0}^{1 } dy^-\\int d^2x\\,\\rho^a(x , y^-)\\,\\alpha_t^a(x , y^-)\\right\\}\\ ] ]    given that the hamiltonian @xmath12 is positive definite @xcite , the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath8-matrix is governed by the lowest lying eigenvalues @xmath26 .",
    "the study of the spectrum of @xmath12 is therefore of direct relevance to understanding the high energy behavior of physical amplitudes .",
    "two limits of hamiltonian @xmath12 have been widely discussed in the literature .",
    "one is valid in the limit of dense projectile , but allows only exchange of two gluons with the target @xcite . in the other limit",
    "one assumes that the projectile is dilute , but resumms all possible multiple interactions of the partons of the projectile with the target @xcite .",
    "the two limiting cases are related by the dense - dilute duality transformation @xcite and have therefore identical spectra . in the rest of this paper",
    "we choose to study the klwmij hamiltonian .",

    "however due to its complexity we will not deal with it in the present paper .    the hamiltonian @xmath36 is the limit of @xmath12 at low color charge density .",
    "the left and right rotation operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 eq.([lr ] ) that appear in eq.([klwmij ] ) are in fact just the color charge density in the hadronic wave function and its conjugate respectively @xcite .    some aspects of the structure of the spectrum of @xmath36 were discussed in @xcite . in particular we know that @xmath36 is positive definite since it can be written as @xmath40 with the hermitian amplitude @xmath41j^b_r(x)\\ ] ] it has two states with zero eigenvalue : @xmath42 the state @xmath43 corresponds to the physical vacuum , that is to the state which is annihilated by the color charge density @xmath44 while @xmath45 represents the black disk state @xmath46 we will find it convenient to work in the basis of eigefunctions of the operator @xmath47 . written in this basis",
    "the wave functionals of the two states are @xmath48 each one of these states sustains a tower of excitations above it .",
    "the rft states `` close '' to @xmath43 correspond to physical qcd states with small number of particles in the projectile wave function .",
    "this interpretation stems from the fact that , as discussed in detail in @xcite the probability distribution @xmath49 has a convenient representation @xmath50=\\sigma[r]\\delta[\\rho]\\ ] ] and thus in the @xmath47 basis @xmath49 is simply a regular function of @xmath47 .",
    "every factor of @xmath47 in @xmath49 corresponds to a gluon in the projectile wave function .",
    "thus expansion of @xmath49 in powers of @xmath51 , is equivalent to expansion in the number of the projectile gluons that scatter on the target .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the eigenstates of @xmath36 which have similar structure , namely in the @xmath47 basis the eigenfunctions are regular functionals of @xmath52 which can be expanded in powers of @xmath51 . since @xmath47 is a regular function of @xmath3 ,",
    "these same states can also be expanded in powers of @xmath3 .",
    "clearly the state @xmath43 is one of those states since the wave function in this case is simply a constant .    on the other hand the state @xmath45 does not fall into this category .",
    "its wave function is not expandable in powers of @xmath51 .",
    "the same is true for other states `` close '' to it .",
    "as explained in @xcite those states correspond to `` holes '' in the black disk and their eigenfunctions are expandable in powers of @xmath2 rather than @xmath53 .",
    "the discussion of this paper pertains directly only to the @xmath43 - like states .",
    "the derivation of the hamiltonian @xmath36 @xcite does not assume anything about the strength of the target fields .",
    "if one interested in the situation when the target fields are small , one can expand @xmath36 in powers of @xmath3 .",
    "the expansion in powers of @xmath3 is equivalent to expansion in powers of the target field , since powers of @xmath3 turn into powers of @xmath16 in the calculation of the scattering matrix eq.([smatrix1 ] ) .",
    "the leading order of this expansion gives @xmath54 , which is the second quantized hamiltonian that generates the high energy evolution in the bfkl framework .",
    "the form of @xmath54 is well known ( see for example @xcite ) . for completeness",
    "we present the derivation of @xmath54 in the appendix , carefully keeping track of the path ordering in the definition of @xmath52 .",
    "although this path ordering is not relevant in many cases @xcite , in general it can not be neglected .",
    "the result is @xmath55\\left[\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\rho^d_y}-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\rho^d_z}\\right]\\rho^b_y\\ ] ] where @xmath56 in the `` normal ordered form '' this reads @xmath57\\left[\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\rho^d_y}-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\rho^d_z}\\right]\\rho^a_x\\rho^b_y+\\int_{xz}\\beta_{xz}\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\rho^a_z}\\rho^a_x\\ ] ] with @xmath58 = \\frac{\\alpha_sn_c } { 2\\pi^2}\\left[\\delta^2(x - z)\\int_u\\frac{1}{u^2}-\\frac{1}{(x - z)^2}\\right]\\ ] ]    the question we want to address is what is the relation between the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath54 and @xmath36 . more importantly , to what extent can we use the results of calculations performed in the framework of bfkl evolution to get information about the spectrum of @xmath36 .",
    "the calculation of the spectrum of @xmath54 is equivalent to solution of the complete set of bkp equations .",
    "the bfkl hamiltonian is a homogeneous function of the coordinates ( @xmath53 ) and momenta ( @xmath2 ) and thus its eigenfunctions are pure powers . taking an eigenfunction in the form @xmath59=\\int_{x_1 ... x_n}g_a^{a_1a_2 ... a_n}(x_1 ... x_n)\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\rho^{a_1}_{x_1}} ... \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\rho^{a_n}_{x_n}}\\ ] ] and acting on it with @xmath54 leads to an eigenvalue equation of the form @xmath60\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sigma_i\\int_x\\beta_{xx_i}g_a^{a_1 ... a ... b ... a_n}(x_1 ... x ... x_n)=\\omega_ag_a^{a_1 ... a_n}(x_1 ... x_n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eqs.([bkp ] ) are precisely the bkp equations @xcite for the rapidity evolution of @xmath61 - gluon exchange in @xmath0-channel .",
    "the index @xmath62 denotes various quantum numbers that characterize the eigenfunction @xmath63 , in particular total momentum , color representation , charge conjugation , parity and so on .    as mentioned above",
    ", expanding @xmath36 and @xmath64 is powers of @xmath3 is equivalent to expanding the @xmath8 matrix eq.([smatrix ] ) in powers of the target color field @xmath16 .",
    "every factor of @xmath16 represents an exchange of a gluon in @xmath0-channel between the projectile and the target .",
    "thus physically , expansion in powers of @xmath3 is equivalent to expansion in the number of gluons exchanged in the @xmath0 - channel @xcite .",
    "consequently , the quantum numbers denoted by the index @xmath62 in eq.([bkp ] ) are the quantum numbers of the @xmath61 - gluon state exchanged in the @xmath0-channel .    for @xmath65 the solution of eq.([bkp ] ) is the reggeized gluon . in this case",
    "the color representation of the exchange is obviously adjoint and the eigenvalues are characterized by the transverse momentum . for the singlet two gluon state , @xmath66 ,",
    "this is the celebrated bfkl equation and the solution is the bfkl pomeron . for arbitrary @xmath61 in the large @xmath67 approximation",
    "these equations have been extensively studied in @xcite where it was shown that the spectrum of the @xmath61 gluon state is described by an integrable spin chain .",
    "although the full spectrum of eq.([bkp ] ) is not known , the salient features are the following .",
    "in the reggeized gluon sector ( @xmath65 ) the eigenvalues are nonnegative . the lowest eigenvalue is vanishing and corresponds to zero transverse momentum exchange @xmath0 .",
    "at nonzero @xmath0 the eigenvalues are logarithmically infrared divergent . for the bfkl pomeron ( singlet @xmath66 exchange )",
    "the lowest eigenvalue is actually negative , corresponding to the growth of the amplitude at high energy with the famous bfkl intercept . at @xmath68",
    "the spectrum is rich .",
    "importantly the lowest eigenvalue for the color singlet exchange is always negative and grows proportionally to @xmath61 , corresponding to the @xmath69 pomeron exchanges this growth is even faster and the absolute value of the most negative eigenvalue is proportional to @xmath70 @xcite . ]",
    "now let us consider @xmath36 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions as noted above are determined by solving @xmath71=\\omega_a\\psi_a[r]\\ ] ] suppose we try to solve this by taylor expanding @xmath72 in powers of @xmath3 .",
    "we thus write @xmath73+\\psi^1_a[\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\rho}]+ ... \\ ] ] to find @xmath64 we need to act on it with @xmath36 also expanded in powers of @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear from the mechanics of the expansion of @xmath39 and @xmath38 given in the appendix , that to all orders in @xmath3 , both the charge densities are proportional to the first power of @xmath2 , and only the power of @xmath3 in @xmath36 grow order by order . therefore the hamiltonian @xmath36 can be written as @xmath74 here the first correction to the hamiltonina , @xmath75 schematically has the form @xmath76 the structure of eqs.([expfu],[expeq ] ) is such that in the leading order the wave function @xmath77 $ ] must be an eigenfunction of @xmath54 .",
    "thus the leading order equation determines @xmath78 completely , and the role of the higher order equations is only to determine the higher order taylor series terms in the expansion of the wave function @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "e.g. having found @xmath80 as an eigenfunction of @xmath54 with eigenvalue @xmath78 , to first order one has @xmath81=\\frac{1 } { \\omega_a - h_{bfkl}}h_1\\psi^0_a\\ ] ] and so on .",
    "it thus appears that the eigenvalues of @xmath36 can be obtained _ exactly _ from the leading order approximation - the bfkl hamiltonian .",
    "the catch however is that we do not know from the bfkl calculation _ per se _ whether the wave function corresponding to a given `` eigenvalue '' will turn out to be normalizable or not . within the bfkl approximation itself ,",
    "none of the wavefunctions are of course normalizable since they are simple monomials of @xmath3 . however only normalizable eigenfunctions of @xmath36 should be used in the expansion of the @xmath8-matrix eqs.([psii],[psiii ] ) .",
    "a similar situation is encountered in simple quantum mechanics .",
    "take for example a one dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath82 let us now try to find its ground state wavefunction in taylor expansion .",
    "we take @xmath83 acting on it with the hamiltonian we get @xmath84 and the schroedinger equation @xmath85 thus for arbitrary @xmath86 we simply have @xmath87 so there is a solution for every possible value of @xmath86 ( in fact there are two solutions for each @xmath86 , but the other one is an odd function of @xmath88 and is outside our initial ansatz ) .",
    "this calculation however does not carry a lot of information since we do not know _ a priori _ which of the so found functions are normalizable when the taylor series is summed to all orders .",
    "we know of course that the spectrum in fact is discreet and therefore most of the `` eigenvalues '' do not correspond to normalizable eigenfunctions .",
    "the situation in the klwmij - bfkl system is similar in this respect . as we have noted above",
    ", @xmath36 is hermitian and positive definite , thus its eigenvalues have to be positive .",
    "on the other hand many of the eigenvalues of @xmath54 are negative ( including of course , the pomeron ) .",
    "we are therefore assured that those eigenvalues do not correspond to normalizable eigenfunctions . as for the positive eigenvalues of @xmath54 ,",
    "it is tempting to surmise that they correspond to normalizable eigenfunctions of @xmath36 .",
    "unfortunately , we have no right to do so .",
    "the question whether resummed taylor series is normalizable or not is very complicated and can not be answered in any finite order of taylor expansion .",
    "we note however that the taylor expansion for @xmath36 is in a subtle way different from that for the harmonic oscillator . in the later case",
    "the leading order of the expansion puts no restrictions at all on possible eigenvalues . in the klwmij case",
    "however , the leading order itself leads to an eigenvalue problem , so that not every @xmath78 is allowed .",
    "even though it is not clear whether the eigenfunctions of @xmath54 give rise to normalizable eigenfunctions of @xmath36 , it is still interesting to illustrate the procedure discussed above by some concrete example . in the following section we will therefore consider higher order in @xmath3 corrections to some eigenfunctions .",
    "we will concentrate on the eigenvalues corresponding to the reggeized gluon , which is the simplest eigenfunction of @xmath54 .",
    "let us look for the eigenstate of @xmath36 which corresponds to the quantum numbers of one gluon exchange .",
    "the state must belong to the adjoint representation of @xmath33 and its wave function when taylor expanded should start with the linear term in @xmath3 .",
    "thus we take @xmath89 acting on it with @xmath54 we obtain the eigenvalue equation @xmath90 this is solved by @xmath91 with the eigenvalue @xmath92 this is nothing but the gluon reggeization .    to calculate first correction to the reggeized gluon state we have to consider @xmath93 which is quadratic in @xmath53 .",
    "we will perform the calculation in a slightly different way which is technically simpler .",
    "we know that the wave function @xmath64 at the end of the day should depend only on @xmath47 .",
    "therefore it makes sense , rather than taking an arbitrary quadratic function , to choose such a function that itself can be obtained from expansion of @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath94 is simply represented as expansion of @xmath47 @xmath95=\\int d^2x\\phi(x)tr \\left(t^ar\\right)_{\\rm first \\ order}\\ ] ] we will take a simple guess @xmath95+\\psi_a^1[\\delta/\\delta",
    "\\rho]=\\int d^2x\\phi(x)tr \\left(t^ar\\right)_{\\rm first+second \\ order}\\ ] ] and will show that it indeed satisfies the klwmij eigenvalue equation to second order in @xmath53 .",
    "the matrix @xmath47 is taken here in the adjoint representation .",
    "we now consider the action of @xmath36 in the state @xmath96 the basic elements we need is the action of the left and right rotation generators on the matrix @xmath47 @xmath97=t^ar(y)\\delta^2(x - y ) ; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ [ j^a_r(x),r(y)]=r(y)t^a\\delta^2(x - y)\\ ] ] with this it is easy to calculate the action of the real and virtual parts of @xmath36 : @xmath98^{cd}j^d_r(y)tr[t^ar_u]=2[r_z-1]^{cd } tr[t^at^cr_xt^d]\\delta(x - y)\\delta(y - u)\\ ] ] and @xmath99[j^c_l(y)-j^c_r(y)]tr[t^ar_u]=tr\\left\\{t^a[t^c,[t^c , r_x]]\\right\\}\\delta(x - y)\\delta(y - u)\\ ] ] hence @xmath100^{cd}tr[t^dt^at^cr_u]+tr\\left\\{t^a[t^c,[t^c , r_u]]\\right\\}\\right\\}\\ ] ] using @xmath101\\right\\}=n_ctr[t^ar_u]\\ ] ] we write @xmath102^{cd}tr[t^dt^at^cr_u]-n_ctr[t^ar_u]\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\alpha } { \\pi^2}\\int_{u , z}k_{uuz}\\phi_u\\left\\{-2[r_z-1]^{cd}tr[t^dt^at^c(r_u-1)]+n_c\\left(tr[t^ar_u]-tr[t^ar_z]\\right)\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now have to expand this to second order in @xmath3 .",
    "the matrix @xmath47 is expanded as @xmath103",
    "the crucial observation is that the first and second order terms come only from the second term in eq.([1glue ] ) . for first order term",
    "this is obvious .",
    "the second order contribution from the first term in eq.([1glue ] ) is proportional to @xmath104\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\rho_u^b}\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\rho_z^e}\\ ] ] however , using the properties of the adjoint su(n ) generators @xmath105 one can easily show that @xmath104=0\\ ] ] and so this contribution vanishes .",
    "thus to second order the eigenvalue equation is @xmath106\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\omega\\int_u\\phi(u)\\left[\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\rho_u^a}+\\frac{i } { 2}f^{abc } \\int_{x^->y^- } \\frac{\\delta } { \\delta\\rho^b(u , x^-)}\\frac{\\delta } { \\delta\\rho^c(u , y^-)}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , this is satisfied as before by @xmath107 of eq.([eigenf ] ) with the eigenvalue eq.([intercept ] ) .",
    "according to our earlier discussion , the eigenvalue determined in the leading order does not change order by order .",
    "an interesting feature of this calculation is that the second order correction to the eigenfunction is the term which describes the two gluon exchange in the @xmath0-channel such that the two gluons are in the octet .",
    "the fact that this term reggeizes precisely in the same way as the one gluon exchange is the essence of the celebrated bootstrap feature in high energy qcd @xcite .",
    "the two @xmath0-channel gluons in the previous calculation are in the antisymmetric adjoint representation .",
    "it is easy to show that two gluons in the symmetric adjoint also reggeize ( see second paper in @xcite ) . to see this",
    "let us consider a similar calculation but take the matrix @xmath47 to be in the fundamental representation .",
    "as before we take @xmath108\\ ] ] where @xmath109 are generators of @xmath110 in the fundamental representation .",
    "the action of @xmath36 on this state is claculated just like before using @xmath111=\\tau^ar_f(y)\\delta^2(x - y ) ; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ [ j^a_r(x),r_f(y)]=r_f(y)\\tau^a\\delta^2(x - y)\\ ] ]    using of completeness relation of fundamental su(n ) generators @xmath112\\ ] ] the properties of fundamental generators @xmath113 and the representation of an adjoint unitary matrix in terms of fundamental matrices @xmath114\\ ] ] one can write @xmath115tr[\\tau^ar_{f}(z)]+n_ctr\\left[\\tau^a\\left(r_{f}(u)-r_{f}(z)\\right)\\right]\\right\\}\\ ] ] the first term on the rhs starts in the order @xmath116 .",
    "thus the eigenvalue equation to second order reads @xmath117\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\omega\\int_u\\phi(u)\\left[\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta\\rho_u^a}+\\frac{1 } { 2 } \\left\\{if^{abc}+d^{abc}\\right\\ } \\int_{x^->y^- } \\frac{\\delta } { \\delta\\rho^b(u , x^-)}\\frac{\\delta } { \\delta\\rho^c(u , y^-)}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again the plane wave eq.([eigenf ] ) is the solution of this equation with the eigenvalue eq.([intercept ] ) .",
    "the second order term proportional to the @xmath118 tensor corresponds to exchange of two @xmath0 - channel gluons in the symmetric adjoint representation . as we have seen in the previous subsection , the antisymmetric octet ( the @xmath119 term ) reggeizes .",
    "thus eq.([symreg ] ) tells us that the symmetric adjoint reggeizes by itself .",
    "this is another example of bootstrap at work .",
    "since the bootstrap plays such an important role in the discussions of high energy amplitudes , it is worth while explaining how and why the bootstrap condition in the klwmij approach is satisfied _ by fiat_.    first off , we note that the bootstrap condition , which leads to reggeization of the two gluon exchange can be stated as the relation between the real part of the kernel of the bfkl equation and the reggeized gluon trajectory@xcite . @xmath120 here @xmath121 is the real part of the bfkl kernel which evolves the color singlet two @xmath0-channel gluon state .",
    "it arises from the first term in @xmath54 eq.([bfklno ] ) . expressing it in",
    "coordinate space in terms of the kernel @xmath122 we have @xmath123\\ ] ] according to eq.([omegabeta ] ) and eq.([eigenf ] ) the fourier transform of @xmath124 into coordinate space is @xmath125 .",
    "fourier transforming the bootstrap condition into the coordinate space we have @xmath126\\ ] ] we can derive this condition directly by considering the eigenvalue equation in the symmetric adjoint channel . take the trial function in the form @xmath127 acting on it by @xmath54 we derive the eigenvalue equation @xmath128&+&\\big[\\beta_{zv}\\psi(z , u)+\\beta_{zu}\\psi(z , v)\\big]\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\omega_q\\psi(u , v)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming that the solution identical to the single gluon exchange @xmath129 exists for all @xmath130 , and taking the integral over @xmath130 we arrive at the configuration space condition eq.([configbootstrap ] ) . ) can not be derived by acting with the bfkl hamiltonian on the color octet antisymmetric two gluon state , even though this state does reggeize .",
    "the reason is that the reggeization of the antisymmetric octet is technically somewhat different form the symmetric one .",
    "the antisymmetric state @xmath131 appears in the wave function @xmath64 in a combination with the one gluon state @xmath132 .",
    "contributions to the two gluon antisymmetric term in the left hand side of the eigenvalue equation eq.([antisreg ] ) arise both from the action of @xmath54 on @xmath131 * and * from the action of @xmath75 on @xmath132 . on the other hand",
    "the action of @xmath75 on @xmath132 does not generate any contributions to the symmetric octet function .",
    "thus the symmetric octet reggeizes by the action of @xmath54 alone , but the antisymmetric state does not . ]    with @xmath125 defined in eq.([beta ] ) , this condition is clearly satisfied .",
    "clearly , the bootstrap condition would be satisfied in the klwmij approach for any functional form of kernel @xmath133 , since the relation between @xmath134 and @xmath135 , eq.([beta ] ) is immutable .",
    "it appears simply due to normal ordering of @xmath54 written in the original form eq.([bfkl ] ) .",
    "thus even if @xmath135 is modified in eq.([bfkl ] ) , the bootstrap condition will still be automatically satisfied .",
    "one can contemplate several reasons for such a modification .",
    "first , higher order corrections in @xmath136 certainly lead to modification of @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "another reason to consider a modification of @xmath135 is the unphysical infrared behavior of perturbative gluon emission which leads to violation of froissart bound @xcite . cutting off long distance tails of the weiszacker - williams field in the emission kernel @xmath135 is a possible `` phenomenological '' solution of this problem @xcite .",
    "one could question in principle the starting point of our discussion - eq.([bfkl ] ) .",
    "however the form eq.([bfkl ] ) is dictated by the hermiticity of @xmath54 .",
    "the real emission part is given by the first term in eq.([bfklno ] ) . by itself",
    "this term is not hermitian , and only with the gluon trajectory term , the second term in eq.([bfklno ] ) , the hermiticity of the hamiltonian is restored .",
    "thus we conclude that the bootstrap condition within the klwmij framework is tantamount to the condition of hermiticity of the hamiltonian which generates the rapidity evolution of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the hermiticity of the hamiltonian is related to the unitarity of the high energy evolution , even though the evolution equation is not a schroedinger equation , but rather a diffusion type equation .",
    "the evolution hamiltonian acts on the probability distribution @xmath49 eq.([evoleq ] ) .",
    "since @xmath137 $ ] has the meaning of probability density , it must be positive definite .",
    "the eigenvalues of the evolution thus better be real , otherwise the `` probability density '' will develop an imaginary part even if one starts with a real and positive distribution at initial rapidity .",
    "this is assured if the evolution hamiltonian is hermitian .    the origin of reggeization , including the gluon rerggeization , is in the @xmath0-channel unitarity .",
    "on the other hand the jimwlk / klwmij approach is formulated in @xmath1-channel and has the most natural interpretation as the evolution of the @xmath1-channel wave function .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see how @xmath0 and @xmath1 channel pictures are interrelated on the example of the gluon reggeization .",
    "the two pictures lead to the equivalent description , if the evolution in rapidity can be described by a hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "we note that the bootstrap equation was used in @xcite to find the generalization of the gluon reggeization for the running qcd coupling case .",
    "the jimwlk / klwmij hamiltonian is of course modified when the running is taken into account .",
    "the practical conclusion from our discussion in this subsection is the following : if we know how to include the running of the qcd coupling in @xmath134 of , then can be used to generalize the full bfkl hamiltonian to the running coupling case .",
    "this idea has been explored in @xcite and led to the `` triumvirate '' structure @xcite .",
    "the same form of the hamiltonian was derived recently in @xcite by direct summation of the feyman diagrams in the dipole approximation . with @xmath138",
    "gives the correct generalization of the jimwlk / klwmij hamiltotian for running qcd coupling both for linear and non - linear term at any value of @xmath67 .",
    "as we have seen above , expansion in powers of @xmath3 is the expansion in number of gluons exchanged in the @xmath0-channel . for example the linear approximation of eq.([regg ] ) allows only one gluon exchange between the partons of the projectile and the target .",
    "diagrammatically the approximate diagonalization discussed in the previous section corresponds to summing the diagrams of fig.[f1 ] .",
    "the evolution therefore allows for emission of an arbitrary number of gluons in the wave function of the projectile , but only for a single gluon exchange between the evolved projectile and the target .",
    "the terms quadratic in @xmath3 are represented in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "the vanishing of the last diagram on fig.[f2 ] leaves the remaining contributions local in transverse coordinate and thereby ensures the reggeization of the two gluon exchange . the third order terms are not local anymore .",
    "in particular one encounters the diagrams of fig.[f3 ] which give a non vanishing bilocal contribution .",
    "klwmij evolution in the approximation where only one gluon exchange in the @xmath0-channel is allowed . ]",
    "klwmij evolution in the approximation which allows exchanges of up to two gluons in the @xmath0-channel . ]    a nonlocal in transverse plain contribution to the eigenfunction with three @xmath0 channel gluon exchanges . ]",
    "reggeization diagramms with arbitrary number of @xmath0-channel gluons that couple to the same parton in the projectile . ]",
    "since the quadratic terms in the expansion of the wave function reggeize in the same way as the linear term , the significant corrections in a sense start form the cubic order .",
    "there is no reggeization of the third order terms in eq.([1glue ] ) nor eq.([regf ] ) , which is another way of stating that three gluon exchange is sensitive to screening corections .",
    "it is thus interesting to calculate the terms of order @xmath116 in the wave function .",
    "although this can be done , the calculation is somewhat tedious . in this section",
    "we will perform a similar calculation , but the one that is easier implemented and has a somewhat more direct meaning in the framework of @xmath36 .",
    "instead of expanding the wave function @xmath139 $ ] in powers of @xmath3 we will expand it in powers of @xmath51 .",
    "this is similar in spirit to @xcite .",
    "since the complete klwmij wave function must depend on @xmath47 , this type of expansion is more direct . to leading order the expansion in @xmath51 and @xmath3",
    "are equivalent . beyond the leading order however they differ both on the calculational and conceptual levels .",
    "expansion in powers of @xmath51 corresponds to the expansion in the number of the projectile partons which participate in scattering . to linear order in @xmath51",
    "our approximation allows only one parton in the projectile wave function to scatter off the target , but it can scatter by exchanging an arbitrary number of @xmath0-channel gluons .",
    "the diagrams which are resummed in this approximation are depicted on fig .",
    "4 . clearly",
    "the leading order expansion in @xmath3 is subsumed in the leading order expansion in @xmath51 , since if we allow only one @xmath0-channel gluon , we also allow only one parton of the projectile to scatter . in higher orders it is",
    "not the case anymore . in this section",
    "we will calculate @xmath140 $ ] correction to the wave function of eq.([quark ] ) .",
    "recall eq.([regf ] ) @xmath141=\\frac{\\alpha } { 2\\pi^2}\\int_{u , z}k_{uuz}\\phi_u\\left\\{tr[1-r^{\\dagger}_{f}(z)r_{f}(u)]tr[\\tau^ar_{f}(z)]+n_ctr\\left[\\tau^a\\left(r_{f}(u)-r_{f}(z)\\right)\\right]\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\frac{\\alpha } { 2\\pi^2}\\int_{u , z}k_{uuz}\\phi_u\\left\\{n_ctr\\left[\\tau^a\\left(r_{f}(u)-r_{f}(z)\\right)\\right]+tr[r_{f}(u)-1]tr[\\tau^ar_{f}(z)]-tr[r^{\\dagger}_{f}(z)-1]tr[\\tau^ar_{f}(z)]+ ... \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the linear term on the rhs is the familiar reggeization term .",
    "we see thus that reggeization is the property of an arbitrary number of gluon exchanges , as long as all the @xmath0-channel gluons couple to * the same parton * ( in this case quark ) in the projectile .",
    "the second term on rhs is second order in @xmath51 .",
    "note that in terms of the expansion in @xmath3 it actually starts with the cubic order .",
    "clearly , to correct the eigenfunction we have to add to our original @xmath142 a term of second order in @xmath51 . guided by the form of the rhs of eq.([hgaf ] )",
    "we take the wave function to second order of the form @xmath143\\nonumber\\\\ g^a_2&=&\\frac{1}{n_c}\\int_{u , v}\\psi(u , v)tr[r^{\\dagger}_f(v)-1]tr[\\tau^ar_f(u)]+\\frac{1}{n_c}\\int_{u , v}\\tilde{\\psi}(u , v)tr[r_f(v)-1]tr[\\tau^ar_f(u)]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will see that this ansatz is general enough to satisfy the eigenvalue equation to second order in the large @xmath67 limit .    in the rest of this section",

    "to summarize we have discussed relationship between the klwmij hamiltonian and its bfkl limit .",
    "eigenfunctions of @xmath36 when expanded to leading order in @xmath3 become eigenfunctions of @xmath54 .",
    "it is however difficult to determine which eigenfunctions of @xmath54 become _ normalizable _ eigenfunctions of @xmath36 when the taylor series is resummed to all orders .",
    "the relation of course pertains only to functions ( functionals ) which are expandable in taylor series in @xmath3 .",
    "we know from the general discussion of @xcite that @xmath36 also has eigenfunctions which do not have such an expansion .",
    "those are states close to the black disk limit . for those states the pertinent expansion is in powers of @xmath2 .",
    "we note that @xmath54 is self dual under the transformation @xmath166 it thus contains eigenstates whose eigenfunctions are monomials in @xmath2 rather than @xmath3 .",
    "the self duality ensures that those have exactly the same spectrum as the eigenfunctions we discussed in the bulk of this paper , even though these states are indeed formally close to the black disk limit    the duality transformation eq.([duality ] ) is the linearized version of eq.([densedilute ] ) which transforms @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "thus the same relation as discussed above exists between the second set of the eigenfunctions of @xmath54 and the eigenfunctions of @xmath37 .",
    "we have also discussed the gluon reggeization and the appearance of the bootstrap condition in the kwlmij formalism .",
    "the bootstrap condition is direct consequence of hermiticity of @xmath167 and as such is a necessary attribute of the approach .",
    "any modification of the emission kernel @xmath133 does not ruin the bootstrap property . since the jimwlk picture is a @xmath1-channel one while the reggeization stems from the @xmath0 channel unitarity",
    ", we conclude that the hermiticity of @xmath167 is the property that reconciles these two approaches .",
    "further we have discussed expansion of the eigenfunctions in powers of @xmath51 rather than powers of @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to expansion in the number of partons in the projectile wave function which participate in the scattering .",
    "we have calculated @xmath140 $ ] correction to the reggeized gluon wave function and found that is has a very simple form in the large @xmath67 limit .",
    "we note in this respect that while the eigenvalue determines the rapidity dependence of the scattering amplitude , the functional form of the wave function determines the impact factor .",
    "this follows from the expansion eq.([psii ] ) which can be written as the overlap of the `` wave function '' characterizing the projectile hadron at the initial rapidity and the eigenfunction of the evolution hamiltonian @xmath168 thus for example the eigenfunction eq.([1glue ] ) will not have zero overlap with a single quark state , while that of eq.([quark ] ) will not overlap with a gluon projectile , since their incoming color representations can not be combined into a singlet .",
    "thus in order for the amplitudes of both , quark and gluon projectiles to have the same energy dependence , there must be a degeneracy in the spectrum of @xmath36 .",
    "we indeed saw this degeneracy explicitly since both eigenfunctions eq.([1glue ] ) and eq.([quark ] ) correspond to the same eigenvalue . on the formal level",
    "this degeneracy is the consequence of the fact that perturbative vacuum breaks the global symmetry of @xmath36 as @xmath169 , the reggeized gluon being `` the goldstone boson '' associated with this breaking @xcite .",
