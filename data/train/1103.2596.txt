    "the process continues until none of the labels change anymore , i.e. an equilibrium is reached . during the course of the algorithm , densely connected sets of nodes form a consensus on some particular label ; thus , at the end , nodes sharing the same label are classified into the same community .",
    "leung  et  al .",
    "@xcite have observed that basic label propagation applied to large ( web ) graphs commonly produces one _ major community _ that occupies most of the nodes .",
    "however , they have shown that the emergence of a major community can be eliminated by using label _ hop attenuation _ technique .",
    "each label @xmath16 has associated an additional score @xmath17 ( initially set to @xmath18 ) that decreases by @xmath19 after each propagation ( @xmath19 is an _ attenuation ratio _ ) . when @xmath17 reaches @xmath20 , the label @xmath16 no longer propagates onward ( see  eq .",
    "( [ eq_alpa ] ) ) , which successfully eliminates the emergence of a major community .",
    "label hop attenuation can be rewritten into an equivalent form that allows altering @xmath19 during the course of the algorithm  @xcite .",

    "hence , @xmath22 when the score @xmath17 is then @xmath23    further analysis in  @xcite has revealed that label hop attenuation has to be coupled with _ node preference _",
    "@xmath24 ( i.e. node propagation strength ) , in order for the algorithm to improve on the basic label propagation .",
    "thus , the label propagation updating rule in  eq .",
    "( [ eq_lpa ] ) is transformed into @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a parameter of the algorithm .",
    "leung  et  al .",
    "@xcite have experimented with node preference equal to the degree of the node ( i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , however , no general analysis was conducted .",
    "the updating rule of label propagation ( eq .  ( [ eq_lpa ] ) ) , or its refinements ( eq .",
    "( [ eq_alpa ] ) ) , might prevent the algorithm from converging  @xcite .",
    "imagine a _",
    "bipartite network _ with two sets of nodes , i.e. red and blue nodes .",
    "let , at some iteration of the algorithm , all red nodes share label @xmath29 and all blue nodes share label @xmath30 .",
    "due to the bipartite structure of the network , at the next iteration , all red , blue nodes will adopt label @xmath30 , @xmath29 respectively .",
    "furthermore , after the next iteration , all nodes will recover their original labels , failing the algorithm to converge .",
    "the problem can be avoided by using _ asynchronous",
    "_ updating  @xcite .",
    "nodes are no longer updated all together , but sequentially , in a random order .",
    "thus , when node s label is updated , ( possibly ) already updated labels of its neighbors are considered ( in contrast to _ synchronous _ updating that considers only labels from the previous iteration ) .",
    "all of the algorithms , presented in the following section , use such asynchronous updating of nodes .",
    "in this section we present different algorithms that employ two unique strategies of community formation , namely , _ defensive preservation _ and _ offensive expansion _ of communities .",
    "first , we briefly present a _",
    "dynamic hop attenuation _ technique in  section  [ sec_hopatt ] .",
    "next , section  [ sec_strats ] introduces and formally discusses the two strategies and associated algorithms ( denoted _ ddalpa _ and _ odalpa _ respectively ) .",
    "last , section  [ sec_kcores ] presents an advanced label propagation algorithm ( denoted _ k - cores _ ) that combines the two strategies in an iterative manner , thus retaining the advantages of both approaches .",
    "label hop attenuation has proven to be a reliable technique for prevention of emergence of a major community ( section  [ sec_lpa ] ) .",
    "still , it is not immediately evident what should the value of attenuation ratio @xmath19 be . in",
    "@xcite authors have obtained good results with values around @xmath31 , however , only a limited set of networks was considered .",
    "we propose a _",
    "dynamic hop attenuation _ technique based on the hypothesisthat hop attenuation should only be employed when a label , or a set of labels , rapidly occupies a large portion of the network ( which could potentially result in a formation of a major community ) .",
    "otherwise , the restriction should be ( almost ) completely relaxed to allow label propagation to reach the equilibrium unrestrained .",
    "the technique would thus retain the dynamics of label propagation , but still successfully prevent the emergence of a major community .",
    "we employ the following hop attenuation strategy . after each iteration ( i.e. sweep through all the nodes ) @xmath19 is set to the proportion of nodes that changed their labels(on the first two iterations @xmath19 is set to @xmath32 and @xmath31 respectively ) . in practice , this results in higher values of @xmath19 in the early iterations of the algorithm , which enables the occurrence of a larger number of ( smaller ) well defined communities , when in the later stages @xmath19 gradually converges to @xmath20 , which refines the communities and preserves only those strongly depicted in the network topology .",
    "moreover , empirical analysis on real - world networks shows that such dynamic strategy successfully eliminates the emergence of a major community ( the exact results are omitted ) .",
    "note that an additional constraint should be imposed to prevent extremely large values of @xmath19 in the late stages of the algorithm ( which , due to the above discussion , indicates some spurious behavior ) .",
    "thus , to ensure convergence , when @xmath19 is greater than @xmath33 ( e.g. @xmath34 ) , we set it to @xmath20 .",
    "leung  et  al .",
    "@xcite have shown that applying node preference ( section  [ sec_lpa ] ) , to alter propagation strength or spread from certain nodes , can greatly improve the performance of the basic label propagation .",
    "nevertheless , our empirical analysis has revealed that different networks favor different strategies for node preference  @xcite .    on small social networks , where high degree nodes reside in the core of each community ( e.g. zachary s karate club network  @xcite ) ,",
    "good performance can be obtained by using _ degree _ or _",
    "eigenvector centrality _",
    "@xcite for node preference .",
    "however , on girvan  and  newman  @xcite benchmark networks with planted partition , where all nodes have equal degree ( on average ) , the measures render useless and are outperformed by _ clustering coefficient _  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , on lancichinetti  et  al .",
    "@xcite benchmark networks superior performance is obtained by using inverted degree or inverted eigenvector centrality .",
    "interestingly , the measures thus complement each node s degree , decreasing the propagation strength from high degree nodes ( and vice - versa ) . in summary",
    ", the analysis has revealed that none of the considered measures is appropriate for general networks ( all different kinds of networks ) .",
    "we have observed that , during the course of the algorithm , applying node preference to the core of each current community ( i.e. to its most central nodes ) can significantly increase the performance on a wide range of real - world networks .",
    "furthermore , the strategy results in a great ability of detecting communities , even when they are only weakly defined . on the other hand , applying node preference to the border of each current community ( i.e. to its edge nodes ) results in an extremely accurate detection , expanding communities that are strongly depicted in the network topology .    based on above observations we propose two algorithms that convey two unique strategies of community formation .",
    "the algorithms estimate the core ( and border ) of each ( current ) community by means of the _ diffusion _ over the network ; and are denoted _ defensive _ and _ offensive diffusion label propagation algorithm _ ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively ) .",
    "let @xmath37 be a value for node @xmath13 thus that nodes in the core of the community have higher values of @xmath38 than border nodes .",
    "the defensive algorithm @xmath35 applies preference ( i.e. propagation strength ) to the core of each community , i.e. @xmath39 , and the updating rule in eq .",
    "( [ eq_alpa ] ) rewrites to @xmath40 on the other hand , the offensive version @xmath36 applies preference to the border of each community , i.e. @xmath41 , and the updating rule becomes @xmath42 during the course of the algorithm , values @xmath38 are estimated using _ random walks _ within each current community .",
    "let @xmath38 be the probability that a random walker , utilized on the community labeled with @xmath9 , visits node @xmath6 ( due to simplicity , we assume that community features _ connectedness _ ) .",
    "@xmath38 can then be computed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the intra - community degree of node @xmath7 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "besides deriving an estimate of the core and border of each community , the rationale here is to formulate label propagation ( i.e. diffusion ) within each of the current communities .",
    "thus , opposed to the algorithm in  @xcite , the main novelty is in considering ( current ) communities , found by the algorithm , to estimate the ( current ) state of the label propagation process and then to adequately alter the dynamics of the process .",
    "comparison of defensive and offensive label propagation on two real - world networks ( see  table  [ tbl_eval_desc ] ) .",
    "revealed communities are shown with pentagonal nodes , when the sizes ( and colors ) of nodes are proportional to the sizes of communities .",
    "defensive propagation produces a larger set of communities that are ( on average ) considerably smaller than those revealed by the offensive propagation.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    defensive and offensive label propagation algorithms result in two unique strategies of community formation , namely , _ defensive preservation _ and _ offensive expansion _ of communities .",
    "the defensive algorithm quickly establishes a larger number of strong community cores ( in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ eq_ddalpa ] ) ) and is able to defensibly preserve them during the course of the algorithm .",
    "this results in an immense ability of detecting communities , even when they are only weakly defined in the network topology . on the other hand ,",
    "the offensive approach produces a much smaller set of communities ( of various sizes ) . laying the pressure on the edge of each community expands ( i.e. enlarges ) those that are strongly depicted in the network topology .",
    "this constitutes a more natural ( offensive ) struggle among communities and results in a great accuracy of the communities revealed .",
    "comparison of the approaches on two real - world networks is shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig_defoff ] ; and for pseudo - code of the algorithms see  alg .",

    "@xmath57    @xmath47      defensive and offensive label propagation ( section  [ sec_strats ] ) convey two unique strategies of community formation .",
    "an obvious improvement would be to combine the strategies , thus retaining the strong detection ability of the defensive approach and high accuracy of the offensive strategy .",
    "however , simply using the algorithms one after another does not attain the desired properties ",
    "any label propagation algorithm , being run until convergence , finds a local optimum ( i.e. local equilibrium ) that is hard to escape from .",
    "raghavan  et  al .",
    "@xcite have already discussed the idea ( however , in different context ) that label propagation could be improved , if one had _ a priori _ knowledge about community cores .",
    "core nodes could then be labeled with the same label , leaving all the other nodes labeled with an unique label .",
    "during the course of the algorithm , the ( uniquely labeled ) nodes would tend to adopt the label of their nearest _ attractor _",
    "( i.e. community core ) and thus join its community .",
    "this would improve the algorithm s stability  @xcite and also the accuracy of the identified communities ( section  [ sec_eval ] ) .",
    "the defensive and offensive label propagation algorithms are thus combined in the following manner ( fig .  [ fig_kcores ] ) .",
    "first , the defensive strategy is applied , to produce initial estimates of the communities and to accurately detect their cores .",
    "all border nodes of each community are then relabeled ( labeled with unique labels ) , so that ( approximately ) one half of the nodes retain their original label .",
    "next , the offensive strategy is applied , which refines the community cores and accurately detects also their borders .",
    "relabeling and offensive refinement are then repeated until the number of communities decreases .",
    "such combined strategy preserves advantages of both , defensive and offensive , label propagation ( section  [ sec_eval ] ) and is denoted _ _ k - cores__algorithm ( due to its resemblance to a well - known _ k - means _ algorithm  @xcite ) .",
    "schematic representation of _ k - cores _ algorithm.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    the core ( and border ) of each community is again estimated by means of ( diffusion ) values @xmath38 ( section  [ sec_strats ] ) .",

    "median _ of values @xmath38 , for nodes in the community @xmath9 , and @xmath16 is an unique label .",
    "hence , the core nodes retain their original labels , when all border nodes are relabeled .",

    "for the use with larger networks , we also briefly present and empirically compare two manners of hierarchical community detection in  section  [ sec_eval_large ] .",
    "the results are assessed using two measures of community structure , namely , _ normalized mutual information _ _ nmi _  @xcite and _ modularity _",
    "@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the latter measures the relative significance of the communities due to a selected _",
    "null model_. let @xmath65 denote the number of edges incident to nodes @xmath66 and let @xmath67 be the expected number of incident edges in the null model .",
    "the modularity then reads @xmath68 where @xmath9 is the identified community ( label ) for node @xmath13 and @xmath19 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the modularity thus measures the fraction of the difference between the number intra - community edges and the expected number of edges in the null model ( @xmath69 $ ] ) .",
    "commonly a random graph with the same degree distribution as the original is selected for the null model .",
    "hence , @xmath70 .",

    "the offensive approach ( _ odalpa _ ) performs considerably better than the basic label propagation ( _ lpa _ ) and can still accurately detect communities , when _ lpa _ already fails . on the other hand , the defensive propagation ( _ ddalpa _ )",
