    "one of the most important quests in particle astrophysics is to identify the sources that produce ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) .",
    "one way to achieve this goal is to directionally correlate uhecr with astrophysical neutrinos .",
    "this correlation would not only indicate us the sites of hadronic acceleration , but also their non single - shot transient nature . on the other hand ,",
    "a positive correlation signal requires sources producing a similar order of fluxes of uhecr ( e.g.protons ) and neutrinos .",
    "this condition is fulfilled by sources with a proton interaction opacity @xmath3 .",
    "meanwhile , sources with @xmath4 or @xmath5 would either produce almost exclusively protons with a small associated neutrino flux or produce only neutrinos , absorbing the corresponding protons , respectively .",
    "a mean free path length can be linked to the interaction between the protons escaping from the source and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , defining the so called gzk sphere of radius @xmath6 mpc  @xcite .",
    "this would give us the limit of the farthest distance of observable uhecr sources , an implicit condition for any correlation analysis .",
    "one key ingredient in a directional correlation analysis between uhecr and neutrinos is to have an accurate determination of the uhecr magnetic deflection .",
    "since the uhecr are charged particles , in their travel to earth , they are going to be deflected due to its interaction with the magnetic field inside and outside the galaxy , the latter being true if they are coming from an extragalactic source .",
    "this type of analysis has been perfomed under different magnetic field hypotheses .",
    "examples include correlation studies between uhecr from the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) and neutrino events from the antares telescope @xcite and between uhecr from telescope array ( ta ) and neutrino events from icecube @xcite .",
    "in all these analyses , an energy independent magnetic deflection has been used .",
    "this kind of estimation is reasonable since we are not certain about the description of the galactic or the extragalactic magnetic field .",
    "however , it is interesting to examine the impact on correlation analyses , calculating the magnetic deflections under different galactic magnetic field models , taking into account energy dependent considerations in their estimations .",
    "following this idea , a study of cosmic ray deflections from centaurus a was proposed in @xcite in which the more recent version of the jansson and farrar @xcite ( jf12 ) magnetic field model has been implemented .",
    "the jf12 is an improved model of the galactic magnetic field , including a regular and random field component .",
    "this model fits very well the wmap7 galactic synchrotron emission map and more than 40,000 extragalactic faraday rotation measurements .",
    "the jf12 model also includes an out - of - plane component and striated - random fields .    in this work",
    "we use four different magnetic field hypotheses : no field , the regular component of the jf12 , the full jf12 field model , and the standard turbulent magnetic field .",
    "these hypotheses are initially used to study the correlation between the telescope array ultra - high energy cosmic ray data @xcite and the icecube-40 neutrino candidates @xcite . since no correlation",
    "is expected , the main analysis of this paper is the comparison of the neutrino flux requirement for a @xmath0 discovery and the @xmath1 cl upper limits , under the four magnetic field hypotheses .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in section 2 we describe the magnetic field models used in this study and we also present the parametrization that we have developed of the angular deflections from the random component of the jf12 field . in sections 3 and 4 we outline the method used to find correlations between uhecr and neutrinos and we describe how to include magnetic field deflections in our statistical analysis . in section 5",
    "we present our results and in section 6 our conclusions .",
    "the angular deflection @xmath7 of an ultrarelativistic particle of charge @xmath8 and energy @xmath9 due to the magnetic field is described by : @xmath10 this formula reflects the inverse proportionality between @xmath7 and @xmath9 which is a key issue for understanding the parameterisation presented in section 3 .     eev .",

    ". these deflections are typically @xmath15 for protons with energy above 40 eev and a propagation distance of order @xmath16 gpc .",
    "meanwhile , deflections caused by the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) , with strength of order @xmath17 g , may be significant .",
    "in fact , this is particularly significant if the cosmic rays are composed by heavy nuclei such as iron and may be deflected by a few tens of degrees even for energies above @xmath18 ev .    for distances up to 500 mpc and energies",
    "@xmath19 ev , typical deflections from egmf are smaller than the resolution of uhecr detectors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if the uhecr sources are within the gzk sphere of radius @xmath6 mpc , we may neglect egmf deflection for energies @xmath20 ev , which is the case in our analysis .",
    "our correlation analysis is mainly tested under two different galactic magnetic field models .",
    "one of these models is the jf12 gmf model @xcite , designed to fit the rotation measures and polarized synchrotron data , as we have already mentioned before .",
    "the jf12 model separates the magnetic field into three components : regular ( coherent ) , striated and purely random fields ( random components ) .",
    "all components extend up to @xmath21 kpc , where @xmath22 is the in - plane radius with origin at the galactic center .",
    "the regular component ( or large - scale field ) is a superposition of three fields : spiral disk field , toroidal halo field and the x - shaped poloidal halo field .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the deflection from the coherent field for a backtracked 57 eev proton .",
    "deflections are stronger for backtracked directions below the galactic plane and are strongest when the particle propagates across the galactic center .",
    "in addition to the regular component of the jf12 , the striated random field is fully aligned to all components of the regular field .",
    "the final component is an isotropic random small - scale field .",
    "the coherence length of these fields is expected to be of order 100 pc or less .",
    "the gmf will be modelled using the best - fit parameters in @xcite and assuming a coherence length of 60 pc for the fully random component .",
    "the other model , which we denote by `` standard '' , was used in ref .",
    "@xcite for similar uhecr - neutrino correlation studies . in this model",
    "the deflections follow a gaussian distribution with width @xmath23 . in @xcite ,",
    "this method was changed to a fisher distribution with an energy dependent concentration parameter .",
    "[ fig2 ]    a secondary contribution of this work is the implementation of a parameterization of the random component of the jf12 gmf model .",
    "this analytic expression would help us in having a better insight into the behaviour of this component while saving computational time in the calculations of our analysis .",
    "this parametrization is valid for small deflections , a condition that restricts the energy range of uhecr , which are protons , to energies greater than 57 eev .",
    "we have chosen protons with this energy since the deflections are going to be small , which is a requirement for our results to be valid .",
    "in addition , for the backtracking method , we have used crpropa 3 @xcite to propagate cosmic rays under the jf12 magnetic field model , using the best fit values given in @xcite , for the coherent field parameters , and in @xcite , for the random field parameters .",
    "( 5 ) ) , which correspond to the additional deflection from the random components of the jf12 field.,scaledwidth=59.0% ]    our procedure for obtaining the parameterisation goes as follows : firstly , for a given initial arrival direction ( observed at the earth ) @xmath24 of a proton with energy @xmath9 , where @xmath25 are in the galactic coordinate system with @xmath26 the galactic longitude and @xmath27 the galactic latitude , we backtrack it through the coherent field to the position @xmath28 . the latter is the final position reached by the proton before it leaves the gmf . secondly ,",
    "starting again from @xmath29 , we backtrack another proton with the same energy @xmath9 through the full magnetic field ( coherent plus random ) until it arrives to its final position @xmath30 , before it exits the gmf .",
    "then the angular distance @xmath7 between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is calculated . after repeating this process over different realizations of the random component of the field",
    ", we may construct a distribution of the angular distance @xmath7 .",
    "to functionally describe the deflection , we have followed @xcite where the random field deflections are given by a fisher distribution . under the small deflection angle hypothesis ,",
    "the probability distribution function @xmath33 of the random field deflections can be described by a rayleigh distribution : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a fit parameter for a given @xmath36 .",
    "we find that the optimal energy dependence of @xmath37 is of the form @xmath38 this energy dependence was tested for energies 57 eev@xmath39200 eev by taking 15 energies logarithmically spaced in this interval .",
    "the parameters @xmath40 are given on a @xmath41 grid distributed uniformly across @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "using the 2500 tabulated points as a sample , the weighted averages ( weight @xmath44 ) are given by @xmath45@xmath46 the distribution @xmath33 also satisfies @xmath47 from eq .",
    "( 5 ) we see that the @xmath48 deflection decreases for higher energies being that for energies above 100 eev it goes like @xmath49 .",
    "the behaviour @xmath50 is therefore recovered in the higher energy regime , in agreement with eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in fact",
    ", this is the reason why there are no terms of order higher than @xmath51 in the expression for @xmath37 . in order to test our proposed parameterization , we display in figure [ fig2 ] a comparison between this one and the numerical simulations , which are based on runge - kutta methods for the @xmath52 of 100 eev protons .",
    "these simulations are performed over 640 realizations of the full jf12 field and with the sky divided into only 49152 arrival directions .",
    "it is clear the excellent agreement between our parameterization and the numerical calculations .    using @xmath33 we can reduce the computational time by up to two orders of magnitude , in comparison with the numerical calculations .",
    "the function @xmath33 only gives information on the angular deflection @xmath7 , leaving for each @xmath7 an allowed region , an annulus , for the final backtracked position .",
    "we assume a symmetrical distribution of the particles in the annulus .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the effect of galactic magnetic deflections on the 69 pao uhecr events and 72 ta events .",
    "these deflections have been obtained due to the regular component , that produce a fixed separation , and the random component , depicted using our parameterization .",
    "it is evident how the greatest deflection given by the random component occurs mainly in the vicinity of the galactic plane .",
    "in order to calculate the correlations between icecube neutrinos and ta uhecrs , we have followed the source stacking method outlined in @xcite .",
    "this method adds up the flux intensities from a group of single sources concentrated in a small region of the sky . for the uhecr",
    ", we consider 72 ta uhecr events with energies @xmath53 eev using surface detector data collected between may 2008 and may 2013 @xcite . we have chosen the energy cut at @xmath54 eev",
    ", since the backtracking method , in which our analysis relies on , is not able to deal with the large gmf deflections produced for energies lower than this limit . for the neutrino sample",
    ", we have used 12877 upward going muon neutrino candidate events recorded by icecube in the 40-string configuration between april 2008 and may 2009 with a livetime of 375.5 days @xcite . while we are aware that there are more recent neutrino samples ( e.g. @xcite ) , the arrival direction of individual events are not available , providing a distribution in zenith angle bins instead .    for the purposes of this study we also work in equatorial",
    "coordinates @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the right ascension and @xmath57 is the declination .",
    "given the geographical location of the icecube neutrino observatory , the declination can be easily related to the zenith angle @xmath58 via the relation @xmath59 . for the galactic magnetic field scenario ,",
    "we study four cases : no field , only with the regular jf12 field , the full jf12 field ( regular plus random components ) and the standard turbulent field .    in order to give a complete picture of our correlation analysis",
    "it is important to comment on the differences between the study in @xcite and ours .",
    "first , in contrast with the magnetic deflections used in @xcite , which are isotropic and independent of cr energy @xmath9 , we are obtaining deflections as a function of @xmath9 and the arrival direction .",
    "the latter is an important difference since the deflections obtained via the backtracking method depend on the magnetic field traversed by the cosmic ray .",
    "second , we are including the deflections from the regular field components that we use for shifting the cosmic ray arrival positions , prior to using them for our correlation analysis .",
    "third , we are considering in our study a variety of gmf models .",
    "the expected number of signal neutrinos @xmath60 is given by : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the livetime , @xmath63 is the icecube muon - neutrino effective area in the 40-string configuration , @xmath64 is the neutrino energy , @xmath58 is the zenith angle , @xmath65 is the muon - neutrino source flux and @xmath66 is the differential solid angle element .",
    "effective areas are averaged over @xmath67 zenith bins as presented in @xcite .",
    "our hypotheses for the neutrino flux are @xmath68 and @xmath69 , based on recent icecube results @xcite . for a better understanding of our results it is important to remark that the @xmath60 is implicitly dependent on declinations since they are dependent on the zenith angle .    to obtain the background we generate @xmath70 pseudo - experiments by scrambling the right ascension in the neutrino data .",
    "centered at each cosmic ray , we define a region of points within an angular distance @xmath71 that we call angular bins of size @xmath71 .",
    "as mentioned before , we include deflections from the regular field components into the cosmic ray positions by shifting them accordingly . for each @xmath71 , the expected count @xmath72 of neutrinos and its",
    "standard deviation @xmath73 are determined assuming a gaussian distribution .",
    "the value of @xmath71 yielding the lowest 90% feldman - cousins confidence level ( cl ) mean upper limit @xmath74 @xcite is calculated , assuming background only .",
    "the value of @xmath74 depends on @xmath75 only .",
    "we then calculate the expected signal @xmath60 based on eq .",
    "( 6 ) , but adding the effects of angular resolution of the experiments by spreading the neutrino source according to a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath76",
    ". we also include an additional spread when dealing with the standard field and the jf12 random field components .",
    "we denote by @xmath77 the expected signal which embodies both effects ( angular resolution and random magnetic field components ) . because our magnetic field models are fixed before applying the analysis , there are no associated trial factors in the calculations .",
    "we find the angular bin size @xmath78 which minimises the model rejection factor mrf=@xmath79 .",
    "for this @xmath78 , we determine the @xmath0 90% cl discovery potential @xmath80 , calculated from the requirement @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is number of events .",
    "we then find the normalisation constant @xmath83 , which gives the strength of the source , from the equation @xmath84 and solving for @xmath85 .",
    "note that while @xmath80 is the expected neutrino count of signal neutrinos summed over all sources , the value of @xmath85 is the strength per source .",
    "we find that for the four gmf model scenarios : no field ( b=0 ) , only with the regular jf12 field ( reg .",
    "jf12 ) , the full jf12 field consisting of the regular plus random components ( full jf12 ) and the standard turbulent field , there is no 5@xmath86 discovery after unblinding the data , being all the observed neutrino events consistent with the background .",
    "this result is expected since the chosen neutrino sample is consistent with atmospheric neutrinos and the compatibility between data and background is clearly shown in figure [ fig4 ] .    in this way , introducing the full jf12 field does not improve the intensity of a correlation signal between uhecr and neutrinos in comparison to other field assumptions . however , and in spite of this result , it is interesting to foresee the impact of choosing a particular gmf model in the values required to satisfy a positive correlation analysis .",
    "for that reason we consider worthwhile to extend our study in order to include the values of @xmath80 and the @xmath1 cl upper limits of the normalisation constant , which we obtain from the relation @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is calculated according to the feldman - cousins prescription .    in tables 1 and 2",
    "we show , for each of the gmf hypotheses , the values of @xmath78 , @xmath80 and the corresponding flux normalization constants @xmath89 and @xmath90 of @xmath80 and @xmath1 cl upper limits respectively .",
    "tables 1 and 2 were obtained by using the 72 ta events and @xmath68/@xmath69 signal respectively .    according to each magnetic field scenario ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath78 and @xmath80 are similar in the sense that , as @xmath78 increases , so does @xmath80 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that @xmath75 and @xmath73 increase with increasing @xmath78 , requiring a larger @xmath80 to get the desired @xmath0 excess above the expected background .",
    "the reason why we get a slightly higher @xmath80 for @xmath91 than the reg .",
    "jf12 case is that the change in declinations , after performing the magnetic field deflections for the reg .",
    "jf12 component , turns out in a variation of @xmath63 and thus in @xmath80 .",
    "the normalisation constant @xmath92 is similar in both the @xmath91 and reg .",
    "jf12 cases because of the negligible change in @xmath78 .",
    "when we compare the full jf12 against the standard scenario , we see that @xmath80 is stronger in the full jf12 but @xmath92 is weaker .",
    "this odd behaviour comes from the different treatment of the magnetic deflections in these models .",
    "as mentioned before , the standard scenario assigns an energy independent deflection , with @xmath93 , which tends to overestimate the random deflections in comparison with the full jf12 ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . as a consequence , for the standard case ,",
    "fewer neutrino events are enclosed within an angular bin size @xmath71 compared to the full jf12 , thus the normalisation constant @xmath92 needs to be higher in order to reach a given value of @xmath80 .",
    "a similar relation is seen in table 2 .",
    "it is also relevant to mention the quantitative differences between the full jf12 and standard field models . in tables 1 and 2 ,",
    "@xmath94 is smaller in the full jf12 by 15% and 17% respectively , indicating that the strength of the point source required for a @xmath0 discovery is somewhat overestimated in the case of the standard field .    regarding the dependence of the power law index @xmath95 on our results , we observe that the relative differences between the normalization constants for different field models are independent of @xmath95 . for the normalization constant itself",
    "we get higher values when @xmath96 .",
    "this can be explained by the steeply falling flux in this scheme , supressing contributions from the highest energy neutrinos at the tail , which have the largest effective area and are the most relevant for @xmath97 .",
    "the values of @xmath80 remain almost intact after a change in @xmath95 , since the effect of this change is subdominant in our procedure .",
    "the results presented in tables 1 and 2 are also shown in figure [ fig4 ] , which is valid because of the negligible differences in @xmath78 between both tables .",
    "the differences in the upper limits is justified by the deviations of the observed numbered of events with respect to its expected background .",
    "if we observe a large excess above the background , a larger flux per source consistent with the observed data are allowed .",
    "for this reason , in the full jf12 scenario , we have an upper limit @xmath98 higher than the other field models .    finally , in table 3 we explore the effects on @xmath80 due to variations of the jf12 field model parameters and compare them to the results of our parameterization , assuming an @xmath99 signal flux and using the 72 ta event data sample .",
    "we chose the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 , where @xmath100 represents the magnetic field strength of the random halo component and @xmath101 modulates the strength of the random striated component with respect to the regular component via the relation @xmath102 .",
    "there is an excellent agreement , of about 1% , between our parameterization and the jf12 numerical simulations , taking its best fit parameters .",
    "we achieve differences of at most @xmath103 after varying both parameters by one standard deviation .",
    "we have made a correlation analysis between the ta uhecr events and the icecube-40 muon neutrino candidates under different gmf model assumptions .",
    "in particular , we have introduced the jf12 model , which expresses our best knowledge of the gmf .",
    "we have not found any correlations between the samples , regardless of the magnetic field hypothesis and the signal flux power law index , being the observed number of neutrino events consistent with the expected background .",
    "the jf12 full field model leads to a @xmath1 cl upper limit that is @xmath104 30% higher compared to the other models .",
    "we note that for the full jf12 field the angular bin size @xmath78 is about 56% higher than the other models , which in turn requires a higher number of signal events @xmath80 to claim a @xmath0 discovery .",
    "in contrast to other assumptions of the magnetic deflection , the jf12 field model incorporates an energy and arrival direction dependence that improves the accuracy of the analysis . in doing so ,",
    "these deflections are not overestimated and leads to a signal strength per source that is weaker by @xmath105 for a @xmath0 discovery .",
    "the latter observation gives us the hope that weaker sources can yield positive correlations given enough time .",
    "the relative differences between our results should stay the same for future measurements .",
    "this analysis hints towards positive correlations due to relaxed flux limits per source with further improvement of the knowledge of the gmf .",
