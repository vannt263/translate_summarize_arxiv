    "@xmath8 gluodynamics at zero temperature is believed to confine since extended vortex degrees of freedom carrying @xmath9 flux are realized in a condensed phase . in lgt one",
    "attempts to localize , configuration by configuration , vortices by center projection , mostly starting from the maximal center gauge ( mcg ) thought to be optimal for that purpose@xcite .",
    "the result , however , @xmath9 flux squeezed into thin @xmath10-vortices , is irreproducible with respect to the gauge copy to which mcg fixing is applied@xcite . in particular",
    ", starting from landau gauge no vortex structure is discovered by subsequent mcg fixing which would allow to understand the area law of wilson loops@xcite .    a gauge independent method of vortex finding is therefore highly desirable .",
    "this was the motivation to explore the capability of coset cooling@xcite for this purpose , complementing other methods making use of the lowest modes of some auxiliary adjoint higgs field ( laplacian center gauge@xcite ) . here , we will report that - instead of fixing the _ confining _ center vortices - the coset cooling method is rather localizing a minimal center vortex content living at the uv scale .",
    "it corresponds to singular fields which carry a finite action density in the continuum limit .",
    "this disagrees with the belief that , approaching the continuum limit , the lattice degrees of freedom can be reduced to gluon fields @xmath11 by expanding @xmath12 around the unit element .",
    "the same observation , based on a new implementation of landau gauge fixing at zero and non - zero temperature , is reported by k.  langfeld@xcite .",
    "coset cooling is relaxation with respect to the _ adjoint _ action which is written for a given link @xmath13 this action tolerates @xmath4 vortex degrees of freedom on the plaquette scale .",
    "the relaxation update consists in replacing @xmath14 by @xmath15 proportional to @xmath16 we have used _ restricted _ coset cooling : when the local gluon action obeys @xmath17 , relaxation of the given link stops .",
    "considering monte carlo ensembles generated at various @xmath6 values , the result of this cooling is rg invariant if and only if the cooling scale @xmath18 is chosen independently of @xmath6 . in the limit @xmath3",
    ", coset cooling leads to a pure @xmath4 configuration .",
    "otherwise , at any finite @xmath19 ( monitoring the residual gluon action density ) , the @xmath4 degrees of freedom are defined by usual center projection @xmath20 .",
    "we consider coset - cooled lattices representing monte carlo ensembles for different @xmath6 as a function of the cooling scale . on one hand , for @xmath22",
    "the wilson action is already strongly concentrated on a subset of plaquettes . on the other hand , at this stage coset - cooled configurations still sustain the full @xmath21 force over distances @xmath23 fm .",
    "the short - range coulomb force due to gluon exchange is already wiped out while extended vortices , which are relevant for the formation of color - electric flux tubes , are still intact .",
    "= 6.6 cm    fig .",
    "1 shows for a @xmath24 lattice how the @xmath21 force measured on coset - cooled configurations changes with decreasing @xmath25 .",
    "data corresponding to various @xmath6 values fall on curves characterized by the cooling scale .",
    "going to smaller @xmath18 , the delayed onset of the string tension can be explained by the suppression of extended vortices with a thickness below the cooling radius .",
    "this is convincing , at least for the cooling scales 1 and 0.71 .",
    "thus the proposed cooling _",
    "does not preserve _ the non - perturbative force at all distances . instead , we have found a method to suppress thick confining vortices below some cooling radius .",
    "this might become useful in future studies of the confinement mechanism . in the following",
    "we will rather concentrate on the singular vortex component ( @xmath26-vortices ) disclosed by the cooling technique .",
    "consider the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath28 which appears as the dimension four vacuum condensate @xmath29 in the operator product expansion .",
    "we found that @xmath30 scales like @xmath5 with @xmath31 for different values of the cooling scale @xmath18 .",
    "2 shows for two values of @xmath18 the dimensionless lattice condensate @xmath32 as a function of @xmath6 . already for finite @xmath19",
    "we find    = 6.6 cm    the condensate @xmath33 as a well defined , rg invariant function of @xmath19 in the continuum limit .",
    "we have tried to describe this condensate as a function of @xmath19 by a fit of the form @xmath34 with ( fit a ) and without ( fit b ) constant @xmath35 .",
    "3 . clearly demonstrates the presence of both @xmath26-vortex and gluon components .",
    "the gluonic contribution @xmath36 to the rg invariant condensate starts to dominate for @xmath37 .",
    "= 6.6 cm    the constant @xmath35 specifies the ultimate @xmath4 vortex content consistent with @xmath38 which is in the ballpark of recent @xmath0 gluon condensate estimates . after landau gauge fixing the density @xmath39 of defect links with @xmath40",
    "has been also found to be rg invariant , @xmath41@xcite .",
    "pure gluodynamics is characterized by a wide gap between the correlation length corresponding to the lowest gauge invariant excitations ( glueballs ) and the confinement scale of few @xmath42 mev . in view of the proposed coset cooling method it is interesting to ask whether removing the coset , i.e. gluon , part distorts the glueball spectrum .",
    "this question has been answered by a comparison of the lowest glueball states in uncooled and coset - cooled gauge field onfigurations reported in ref.@xcite . for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 on a @xmath46 lattice the lowest @xmath47 glueball state ( with mass @xmath48 gev ) and the lowest @xmath49 glueball state ( @xmath50 gev ) , have been identified first on uncooled configurations .",
    "4 demonstrates how the renormalized @xmath47 glueball correlator measured on coset - cooled configurations is fitted by the exponential slope obtained from uncooled @xmath0 correlator data .",
