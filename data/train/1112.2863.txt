    "we have applied the direct variational method within the extended thomas - fermi approximation with effective skyrme - like forces to the description of the radii of nucleon distributions . in our consideration , the thin - skinned nucleon densities @xmath27 and @xmath213 are generated by the profile functions which are eliminated by the requirement that the energy of the nucleus should be stationary with respect to variations of these profiles .",
    "an advantage of the used direct variational method is the possibility to derive the equation of state for finite nuclei : dependence of the binding energy per particle or the pressure on the bulk density @xmath72 .",
    "we have evaluated the partial pressure @xmath214 which includes the contributions from the symmetry and coulomb energies .",

    "[ fig2 ] this fact is demonstrated as a deviation of the radius of the nucleon distribution from the saturation behavior @xmath164 in the nuclei beyond the beta - stability line .",

    "we have pointed that the charge radii of proton distributions show the shell oscillations with @xmath7 which are related to the shell effects in the coulomb energy .",
