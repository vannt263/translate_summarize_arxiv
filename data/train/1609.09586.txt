    "the idea of viewing permutations as enriched trees has been around for several decades in different research communities . for example , the recent enumerative study  @xcite of pattern avoiding permutations , in which _ ( substitution ) decomposition trees _",
    "play a crucial role .",
    "also , the analysis of some sorting algorithms is very linked to tree representations of permutations : _ pq trees _",
    "@xcite appear in the context of graph algorithms and _ strong interval trees _ arise in comparative genomics  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein , for instance ) .",
    "the focus of this article is the study of strong interval trees ( a.k.a .",
    "decomposition trees ) .",
    "their typical shape ( under the uniform distribution ) has been described in  @xcite , showing that they have a very flat , somehow degenerate , shape .",
    "strong interval trees are an essential tool to model and study genome rearrangements .",
    "but contrary to what this average shape shows , the trees associated to permutations that arise in the comparison of mammalian genomes seem to have a richer , deeper structure .",
    "this suggest that trees coming from permutations under the uniform distribution do not adequately represent the trees that arise in genomic comparisons .    in  @xcite , bouvel  _ et al .",
    "_ considered a subclass of strong interval trees selected because they represent what is known as _ commuting scenarios _  @xcite that correspond to the class of _ separable permutations_. this is a first step towards a more relevant model of permutations which arise in genome comparison . by studying asymptotic enumeration and parameter formulas for separable permutations , they proved that the complexity of the algorithm of  @xcite solving the _ perfect sorting by reversals _",
    "problem is polynomial time on separable permutations , whereas this problem is np - complete in general .",
    "furthermore they were also able to describe some average - case properties of the perfect sorting scenarios for separable permutations .",
    "ultimately , a clear understanding of the properties possessed by the strong interval trees that represent the comparison of actual genomes might tell us something about the evolutionary process .",
    "bouvel  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite conclude their study on separable permutations with a suggestion for the next step : strong interval trees with degree restrictions on certain internal nodes .",
    "it is a very controlled way to introduce bias in the distribution of strong interval trees .",
    "this is precisely what we do in this work ; namely , we study strong interval trees where the prime nodes have a bounded number of children . in this work",
    ", we focus on the combinatorial analysis of these restricted sets of trees . they can be completely understood combinatorially and analytically , and so we have access to enumeration and analysis of some tree parameters that are ultimately related to the complexity of computing perfect sorting scenarios , or to properties of these scenarios .",
    "although our initial motivation is the application of combinatorial analysis to a better understanding of models for genome rearrangements , we believe our study has ramifications of independent interest in analytic combinatorics .",
    "indeed , our work reveals a very lush substructure of permutations whose study from an analytical point of view allows us to formulate new questions on the convergence of sequences of combinatorial series .    specifically , we define nested families of trees ( which are almost simple varieties of trees ) whose limit is the set of all strong interval trees .",
    "the components are then families of trees to which we are able to apply a very complete set of tools : asymptotic analysis , parameter analysis , random generation . but the complete set of strong interval trees is not even close to be a simple variety of trees , so that these tools are inaccessible to the full class without working through the size preserving bijection between strong interval trees and permutations .",
    "the question that we ask is then to understand at the analytical level the convergence of algebraic subclasses of a non - analytic class towards the full class .",
    "as we explain in details in our work , this question is naturally asked for strong interval trees , but it could also be considered for other classes such as @xmath0-regular graphs  @xcite or @xmath1-terms of bounded unary height  @xcite .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : general ] we present some very general theorems for asymptotic enumeration and parameter analysis in families of trees counted by leaves , that are widely applicable .",
    "then in section  [ sec : cit ] we describe strong interval trees , a decomposable combinatorial class of trees counted by leaves , in bijection with permutations .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : restrictedcit ] we introduce a filtration of strong interval trees , where we bound the arity of so - called _ prime _ nodes . as discussed in section  [ sec : restrictedcit ] , this filtration has applications in bio - informatics for the study of genome rearrangements .",
    "but it also witnesses an intriguing analytic phenomenon : the convergence of a sequence of ( well - behaved and algebraic ) families of trees towards the ( transcendental and non - analytic ) class of permutations .",
    "section  [ sec : filtration ] establishes some first results in the exploration of this phenomenon .",
    "there are many works which study the average case behavior of tree parameters , where the size of a tree is the number of internal nodes or of both internal nodes and leaves .",
    "the generating functions of these trees satisfy a functional equation of the form @xmath2 , and when @xmath3 satisfies certain conditions , such as analyticity , then there are formulas for inversion , resulting in explicit enumerative results .",
    "a class of trees amenable to this treatment is said to be a _ simple variety of trees_. the subject is exhaustively treated in  section vii.3 of  @xcite .",
    "if , instead , we define the size of a tree as the number of leaves , the generating function satisfies a relation of the form @xmath4 .",
    "the same general theorems on inversion still work , and it suffices to apply them and unravel the results .",
    "even though they are less frequent , these have also been studied in the literature , and the applicability of the inversion lemmas is noted in  example vii.13 of @xcite . in this section",
    "we do this explicitly . in this work ,",
    "when refering to simple varieties of trees , we mean a family of trees where the size is defined as the number of leaves , and whose study falls into the scope of the results of the present section .",

    "our interest is the global shape of the trees , and not the particulars of the internal nodes .",

    "these have for instance significantly fewer prime nodes and are flatter .",
    "a careful statistical analysis would however be necessary to properly invalidate our proposed model .",
    "it would also set a solid basis for the comparison of other proposed models with the data , since this statistical analysis could then be reproduced for other subclasses of strong interval trees defined by finer restrictions .",
    "one of our long term goals on the biological side is to identify the very specific traits which arise in permutations which encode mammalian genome comparisons , and to provide more adequate models .",
    "chauve , mccloskey and mishna  @xcite have taken some preliminary steps in this direction , and a reasonable model might use @xmath14 trees as components to build realistic trees .",
    "note that permutations are very often used to model real - world problems , not only in biology : for instance also in sorting problems in algorithmic",
    ". we can therefore view this goal as part of a larger project : that of defining subclasses of permutations modeling `` well '' the permutations occurring in these real - world contexts ( using for instance strong interval trees ) , and of proving statistically that these models indeed represent well the data .",
    "we now turn to the second aspect of the study of the classes  @xmath14 : understanding the convergence towards the full class @xmath57 , in particular at the level of the asymptotic number of trees in the class .",
    "the example of @xmath57 we have in hand is a particularly instructive one , since the limit is known by other means , namely from the correspondence between @xmath57 and permutations .",
    "this example is also meant to illustrate a more general goal , discussed further in subsection  [ subsec : analytic ] : that of analyzing classes of trees @xmath58 via a filtration  @xmath59 similar to  @xmath14 , especially when @xmath58 fail to be a simple variety of trees because the series governing the number of children available ( our @xmath60 ) is not analytic .      recall that @xmath61 denotes the number of strong interval trees with @xmath62 leaves and arity of prime nodes at most @xmath0 . for any fixed @xmath0 , the asymptotic behavior of  @xmath61",
