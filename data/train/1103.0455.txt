    "a comparison of straizys and lazauskaite @xcite main sequence to bessell and brett @xcite shows a good agreement .",
    "minor deviations are only present for early type stars where straizys and lazauskaite s new relation has systematically bluer @xmath18 colors than bessell and brett . since the difference is only minor and concentrated to the earlier spectral types , which we do not use anyway , we have continued using bessell and brett @xcite .    for the following considerations reference is made to fig .",

    "is confined to a part of the interior of the @xmath0 relation in fig .",
    "we confine the observed @xmath19 sample by the upper straight line that has a slope equal to that of the reddening vector , @xmath20 / @xmath21 , and intersects the main sequence where the giants branch off the main sequence .",
    "the lower confining reddening vector is introduced because the derivative of the @xmath0 relation is almost identical to the slope of the reddening vector implying that the intersection , @xmath22 , is undetermined .    some stars with low or no reddening will be scattered to the blue side of the standard relation by the photometric errors .",
    "the maximum error accepted in the present note is 0.040 mag in each of the three 2mass bands .",
    "the curve to the blue of the standard relation defines the blue limit for the stars included in the sample . in order to exclude most unreddened m - type stars we impose a upper @xmath23 boundary just below the standard relation by shifting the relation by the maximum error , 0.040 mag , in j , h , and k. stars inside the dashed `` polygon '' are accepted for further study .",
