    "the low - energy processes with a hadron participation are permanently in the center of theoretical and experimental activity .",
    "new measurements and more precise experimental data force us to look for and verify new theoretical approaches to describe and understand strong coupling phenomena .",
    "it is well known , an exact theory of ( low - energy ) hadron interactions should be nonperturbative ( np ) .",
    "that is why a lot of hadron characteristics ( effective couplings , formfactors etc . )",
    "are calculated at the level of the fundamental qcd fields , which are submerged into the np vacuum .",
    "in particular , qcd sum rules method operates with some phenomenological np vacuum parameters - non - zero quark and gluon condensates - to simulate manifestations of the vacuum and its affection on hadron characteristics .",
    "effective theories of meson - meson interactions provide an additional possibility to extract information on the low - energy hadron dynamics and structure , accounting for the np vacuum via phenomenological parameters .",
    "there are two well known and widely used methods of effective lagrangian s approach in hadron physics : derivation of the effective lagrangian from the qcd immediately @xcite-@xcite , and the use of various dynamical symmetries to build the basic lagrangian in a phenomenological way @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular , the gauge scheme of vector meson interactions with hadrons was suggested in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the linear sigma model @xmath1 is the most popular and examined approach to the hadron phenomenology , which is used for the effective study of nucleon - nucleon @xcite-@xcite and quark - meson interaction @xcite,@xcite,@xcite-@xcite with regard to the vector meson dominance @xcite-@xcite .",
    "when the fundamental qcd is a starting point , chiral @xmath2 perturbation theory @xcite follows from a low - energy expansion of the qcd green functions in powers of the external momenta and of the ( low ) quark current masses .",
    "this theory leads to an effective low - energy lagrangian , which includes some phenomenological coupling constants and allows to analyze @xmath3 - scattering and pion formfactor as well .",
    "generalization of the theory with @xmath4 symmetry has been done , and it was used , especially , for the calculation of the masses and decay constants for the pseudoscalar octet @xcite -@xcite .",
    "the chiral model can be also deduced from the interacting qcd fields due to some bosonization procedure , transferring the gauge ideas from the quark level qft to the meson one @xcite in the framework of the nambu - jona - lasinio - type lagrangian with the six - quark interaction , suggested by thooft .",
    "in such a way , initial quarks with low current masses transform to the constituent ones with effective masses @xmath5 , including some contribution of the internal gluon substructure of a hadron .",
    "the sigma model at the quark - meson level can be dynamically generated via ( diverged ) quark loops with a cutoff parameter @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therewith , the loops simulate an uprising of the nonperturbative model \" ` condensate `` .",
    "so , the proportionality of pion mass to the ' ' quark condensate \" is restored in the framework of such effective models .",
    "further , to incorporate electromagnetic and strong vectorlike interactions into the effective theory an appropriate vector fields are introduced as the gauge fields .",
    "treatment of the vector mesons as the gauge fields , which realize a dynamical symmetry , allows to diminish some theoretical uncertainty of phenomenological description of the hadron interactions .",
    "effective gauge models can be formulated as the phenomenological ones , based on the specific dynamical symmetry of interactions .",
    "for example , in  @xcite-@xcite the gauge models were successfully used for the consideration of some low - energy aspects of baryon - meson interaction .",
    "it means that the fundamental quantum field principles ( the gauge symmetry ) can be applied to the description of interactions at the different hierarchical levels . in the case under consideration",
    ", it provides a transition from the quark - level sigma model ( @xmath6 ) to the nucleon - level sigma model ( @xmath7 ) ( as it was shown in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xcite , the nonlinear sigma model structure can be derived from the qcd ) .    to construct an effective meson interaction model",
    ", we use the gauge scheme based on @xmath0 group .",
    "this group is the simplest one to consider the light unflavored vector mesons , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , together with the photon , as the gauge fields .",
    "moreover , it has the necessary symmetry to study processes with the vector fields that are mediated by the electromagnetic and strong meson - meson and quark - meson interactions . here",
    ", we consider only the interactions that are insensitive to the chiral structure ( the gauge generalization of corresponding chiral group is in progress ) .",
    "for the case in question , to analyze the strong effects it is sufficient to localize @xmath10 group - the diagonal sum of chiral @xmath11 subgroups of the global @xmath2 .",
    "the extra @xmath12 groups are added for the gauge realization of the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) together with the electromagnetic interaction ( see the next section ) .",
    "it is known , the gauge scheme of vmd is provided by the electromagnetic quanta mixing with @xmath9- and @xmath8- fields . in particular",
    ", this scheme describes some important features of radiative decays of vector mesons .",
    "after the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath13 local symmetry , residual scalar massive degrees of freedom ( higgs fields ) should be interpreted as some observable scalar mesons .",
    "more exactly , they can be associated with the scalar isotriplet @xmath14 and isosinglet @xmath15 ( see the next section ) .",
    "this model reproduces the relation @xmath16 if the quark condensate is taken into account in the equation for the vacuum shift . here",
    ", we deal with the constituent quarks not with the fundamental current ones .",
    "these effective fields in the model are taken as the fundamental representation of the gauge group .",
    "then , ( effective ) quarks degrees of freedom are used to account for the effects of an internal hadron structure in meson - meson interactions .",
    "in fact , quark - meson models ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) are necessary hybrid approaches to reproduce both nonperturbative and structure effects of the low - energy meson interactions .",
    "manifestations of the fundamental hadron components are reproduced by the constituent quarks and mesons , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "then , the last ones have a dual role in the model - they appear both as an external fields ( particles of matter ) and as an effective virtual components of internal hadron vacuum : `` gluon '' degrees of freedom ( @xmath17-meson ) and an excitation of the quark sea ( @xmath18-meson , which is linked with the quark current ) .",
    "so , we deal with the @xmath17 model inspired consideration , which incorporates gauge interactions of vector mesons with the constituent quarks .",
    "this quantum field model is renormalizable `` by the construction '' and it accounts for hadronic internal degrees of freedom as a quantum fields .",
    "in essence , two - level ( quark - meson ) structure of the model realizes an analog of the `` bootstrap '' idea .    in this",
    "work processes of the vector meson decays are only considered .",
    "the gauge sector of the model contains a number of free parameters , which can be fixed from the well measured two - particle decays and masses of vector mesons .",
    "as it will be shown later , the gauge model predictions for the radiative vector meson decays do not contain any free parameters .    as a rule",
    ", the radiative decays @xmath19 and @xmath20 are described in a phenomenological way . within the framework of this gauge model ,",
    "these reactions arise at the tree level .",
    "as it will be shown , there is a good agreement between the theory and the experimental data on the vector meson radiative decays even without loop corrections @xmath21 ( see also @xcite and the section 3 ) .",
    "so , from the direct calculations it follows that these processes can be successfully studied in the gauge field approach .",
    "main contribution of an internal hadron structure into physical processes is described by the quark - meson sector of the model .",
    "this aspect of the model has been tested in @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 decays , which arise due to the quark - meson interaction at the loop level only .",
    "the results of calculations are in a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "analysis of the decay @xmath25 @xcite,@xcite-@xcite is much more cumbersome .",
    "calculations done show that the three - pion decays of @xmath26 and @xmath27 mesons are well described in this model .",
    "the results obtained are in preparation now .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "the gauge field model is described , and some details of calculational procedure are also presented .",
    "numerical results for tree decays @xmath28 and @xmath29 are discussed in section 3 .",
    "we consider loop decays @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 in section 4 .",
    "the gauge model of the low - energy meson interactions is based on the conceptual assumption concerning the transfer of gauge principles from the fundamental quark level to the effective hadron one .",
    "an explicit transfer via the bosonization procedure was described , for example , in @xcite for the case of quark - meson hierarchy levels .",
    "remind also , meson physics follow from the qcd through low - energy expansion of quark green functions in the chiral form @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so , an effective quark - meson theories can be derived from the `` first principles '' .",
    "applicability of the gauge approach to the baryon - meson interaction has been demonstrated in @xcite-@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we show the validity of the gauge scheme with the spontaneous symmetry breaking for the studying of meson - meson and quark - meson effective interactions together with the vector meson dominance .",
    "strong and electromagnetic interactions are united in the gauge scheme , and the simplest variant of corresponding dynamical symmetry is based on @xmath33 group . in a general case ,",
    "the total chiral group of symmetry should be localized to consider both vector and axial - vector mesons . however , for the application of the gauge approach to the @xmath27 and @xmath26 strong and electromagnetic decays only , it is sufficiently to localize the @xmath10 group together with the additional @xmath12 groups .    the @xmath17- model symmetry can be realized in explicitly chiral form as the representation of @xmath2 global group .",
    "then , the quark doublet transformation is : @xmath34    this transformation can be also rewritten in an equivalent form with the same number of independent parameters , @xmath35 and @xmath36 : @xmath37    having regard to the standard structure of the quark interaction with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see the second term in the ( [ e:8 ] ) ) , parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 define transformation properties of @xmath38 multiplet with respect to the global group : @xmath39    as it is seen from the expressions above , the set of @xmath35 parameters corresponds to the diagonal sum of @xmath11 subgroups , i.e. the @xmath10 group . in the model",
    ", just this group is localized to analyze strong interactions of @xmath27 meson triplet .",
    "to introduce @xmath9- singlet and electromagnetic field , we add two extra @xmath12 groups , which should be localized too . certainly , if the total chiral group were localized , axial vector gauge fields will occur as a chiral partners of vector mesons .",
    "however , to describe radiative processes with vector mesons only we restrict ourselves by the localization of above mentioned groups .    here , the triplet @xmath40 , the singlet @xmath17-meson and @xmath41-quarks are the initial fields of matter , where the triplet of pions is the adjoined representation of the @xmath10 gauge group , and the quark doublet , @xmath42 , is the fundamental representation of this one .",
    "remind , the @xmath17 and @xmath18 have a dual nature in the model both due to their contribution to the processes inside a hadron np medium and their manifestations as the real mesons .",
    "note , also , that the @xmath17 field does not related directly with the non - singlet ( flavor ) quark current .",
    "so , we can assume the @xmath43 meson is a `` gluonium '' state , and it can be interpreted as @xmath44 meson @xcite , @xcite-@xcite . at the same time , physical massive scalar fields , emerging from the initial higgs multiplets , can be associated with the scalar mesons : isotriplet @xmath14 and isosinglet @xmath15 ( see below ) .",
    "naturally , this interpretation should be confirmed by the study of the scalar sector .",
    "the detailed analysis of the scalar mesons properties ( masses , couplings , decay widths ) in the gauge model will be done in a forthcoming paper .    from these considerations with an account of the self - action nonlinear terms , the initial model lagrangian can be written as follows : @xmath45 here @xmath46 - is the first generation quark doublet ; @xmath47 - two doublets of complex scalar fields with the hypercharges @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the gauge derivatives and field strengthes are : @xmath51 in principle , the gauge invariant term @xmath52 should be added to the lagrangian .",
    "however , this term can be diagonalized from the very beginning by the orthogonal transformation of the initial @xmath53 and @xmath54 fields .",
    "so , we get the same lagrangian with the redefined @xmath53 and @xmath54 fields",
    ".    there is one further consequence of the @xmath52 term diagonalization .",
    "namely , to describe the realistic processes of decays and the lepton scattering we can introduce interactions of leptons with @xmath55 and @xmath12 fields in the gauge form : @xmath56 where interaction of @xmath54 field with leptons is driven by the phenomenological coefficient @xmath57 .",
    "the last term in the above formula is just the coupling , which is resulted from the diagonalization of @xmath52 term in the initial lagrangian .",
    "thus , the above interaction of leptons with the @xmath54 vector field can be used to describe the decays @xmath58 .",
    "analogous point - like interaction of lepton doublets with scalar doublets is forbidden in the model by the symmetry and renormalizability demands .",
    "physical states are formed by the primary fields mixing when quadratic mass forms of scalar and vector fields are diagonalized . at the tree level ,",
    "the mass forms arise as a result of vacuum shifts : @xmath59 this shift defines the gauge fields masses at the tree level entirely .",
    "it is known , the physical photon has a hadron ( quark ) component , which manifests itself in interactions with meson fields . in the model , an emergence of this primary hadron component in the photon results from the mixing in the gauge sector .",
    "the structure of the vector boson physical states can be illustrated in a tree approximation ( when the mass matrix @xmath60 does not contain any loop corrections ) by the following expressions : @xmath61 where the mixing angle @xmath62 is determined by the diagonalization of the vector fields quadratic form .",
    "due to the mixing ( [ e:11 ] ) the processes with initial `` unphysical '' photon , @xmath63 , receive contributions from intermediate hadron states : @xmath64 some parameters of the mixing can be fixed from the experimental data on the vector meson masses and decay widths .",
    "it will allows to describe decay properties of vector mesons , which are considered in this paper . as it can be seen from the following",
    ", description of vector mesons ( their radiative decays , in particular ) in this gauge scheme is in a good agreement with the experimental data @xcite , confirming the gauge status of @xmath65 and photon .",
    "now , we give the main part of the physical lagrangian which will be used for calculations : @xmath66 in eqs.([e:12a ] ) : @xmath67 here @xmath68 - are tree mixing parameters ( see ( [ e:11 ] ) ) .",
    "note also , from the point of view of this mixing @xmath9- meson is not a pure isoscalar state in the model .",
    "however , the isotriplet admixture to the @xmath9 structure is very small : it is proportional to @xmath69 which is close to zero , as we will see later .",
    "so , the corresponding contribution can be omitted in calculations involving the @xmath9- meson in a good approximation .    as a direct consequences of the model",
    ", we have the following relations : @xmath70    introduction of the vector fields into the theory in a gauge way provides universality of couplings with the vector fields .",
    "an analogous universality of the vector and pseudoscalar meson interactions was analyzed in @xcite in a phenomenological way .",
    "this universality strictly bounds the number of free parameters in the gauge sector of the model .",
    "namely , from ( [ e:12a ] ) it follows that the vector boson interactions with mesons is described by three gauge parameters : @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the way to analyze low - energy quark - meson lagrangians is well known : effective couplings of vector boson interaction with mesons and ( constituent ) quarks are defined by the ( diverged ) quark loops .",
    "in such a way the divergencies are regularized with a cutoff parameter @xmath74 , which , in fact , fixes some np scale of the theory .",
    "an analogous scheme can be applied to the physical lagrangian ( [ e:12a ] ) .",
    "namely , due to renormalizability of the model an effective couplings can be reproduced by the sum of ( bare ) tree and one - loop quark and meson ( logarithmically diverged ) diagrams , which also introduce some np scale ( @xmath75 ) . certainly , to define the effective couplings in this model we should add to the tree vertices all extra loops with scalars ( i.e. not only @xmath76 - triangles as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and to take into account an existence of the mixing angles , @xmath77 and @xmath62 , in the couplings .",
    "then , the sums of ( bare ) tree vertices in ( [ e:12a ] ) and ( logarithmically diverged ) loop corrections are interpreted as the effective phenomenological couplings on the mass shell of external particles .",
    "these couplings incorporate both short - distance and long - distance contributions from the very beginning and their values can be fixed from the data on meson two - particle decays with a sufficient accuracy .",
    "we call them later as the gauge `` tree '' ( on - shell ) vertices having the bare vertices tensor structure",
    ".    then , we can define a transition `` vertex formfactors '' as off - shell corrections to the `` tree '' effective couplings . to have these formfactors , like @xmath78 , @xmath79 etc .",
    ", we should collect all needed loop ( quark and meson ) contributions , which , in general , depend on some np scale and can not be considered in the chiral limit ( cl ) only .",
    "note , formfactor @xmath80 for off - shell quarks has , as it should be , an extra components @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the ( external ) quark momenta .",
    "however , as it follows from a preliminary estimations , the value of @xmath74 in the diagrams of @xmath83 and @xmath84 types can be fitted ( we get @xmath85 ) to provide contributions of the off - shell formfactors into physical parameters ( decay widths and so on ) no more than @xmath86 .",
    "it means , the gauge principle , i.e. the universality of `` tree '' effective gauge couplings takes place in the model with this accuracy .",
    "so , the next order corrections for the diagrams considered can be clearly divided on two types .",
    "first , there are a loop corrections which can not be reduced to contributions into the effective `` tree '' vertices and off - shell transition formfactors .",
    "the role of such loops was studied in @xcite , @xcite , in particular , for the tree level reactions like @xmath87 .",
    "second , the rest loop corrections represent on - shell ( `` tree '' ) and off - shell formfactors with corresponding tensor structure .",
    "approximately , an account of the formfactors can be reproduced by some multiplicative parameter in tree amplitudes .",
    "important , this prescription - an obvious discrimination of an effective tree on - shell constant couplings ( remind , the gauge principle demands the same @xmath78 and @xmath88 tree couplings ) and off - shell formfactors clearly depending on the np cutoff parameter - prevents us from the double - counting in the model .",
    "note , in these formfactors masses of internal particles interpret as the physical ones , i.e. all needed self - energy contributions are taken into account .",
    "therewith , decays like @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath22 are described by finite quark loop diagrams . with a good accuracy",
    ", the vertex couplings in these diagrams can be taken as the effective @xmath88 ( @xmath78 ) tree constants ( not formfactors ) in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "note , these arguments can be applied to the electromagnetic vertices too - the vertices are renormalized by strong interactions , but the ( formfactor ) corrections from quark and meson loops are small in the case under consideration .",
    "this fact is endorsed by calculations of loop processes with on - shell photons , in particular , @xmath22 ( see below ) .",
    "thus , the consistency and supportability of the approach is verified by the results for all types of possible reactions - both at the tree and the loop level .",
    "to fix the set of the gauge physical couplings and vacuum shifts , we use experimentally observable mass spectrum and widths of some two - particle hadronic decays of vector mesons @xcite - in our model these processes occur at the tree level ( remind , they define on - shell `` tree '' couplings ) .",
    "due to the gauge universality , this approach raises the predictability of the model when the vmd processes are considered .",
    "namely , constants @xmath93 , @xmath94 ( or @xmath95 ) and @xmath96 are fixed from the experimental values of @xmath97 @xmath98 and @xmath99 . it should be noted , the last decay takes place due to the mixing ( [ e:11 ] ) only .",
    "then , the value of @xmath71 can be extracted from the relation @xmath100 .",
    "then , for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 decays we use tree formulas of the form : @xmath101 here @xmath102 is @xmath103 or @xmath9-meson , @xmath104 for the @xmath105 decay and @xmath106 for the @xmath9 decay . for the @xmath107 decay @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath109 is the vector meson mass and @xmath110 is the known kallen function .",
    "@xmath111 are @xmath112 or @xmath113 states .",
    "thus , from the experimental data and ( [ e:12c ] ) we get the consistent set of values of these main parameters , which will be used to describe the meson properties in the model : @xmath114    it should be added , the tree form of the mixing ( [ e:11 ] ) is caused by the diagonalization of the real mass matrix ( which is generated by the vacuum shifts without any self - energy contributions ) with the help of the real orthogonal matrix . having real values of the tree gauge couplings , the relative phase in the @xmath78 and @xmath115 channels at the tree level ( see ( [ e:12a ] ) ) can not be reproduced .",
    "experiments , however , indicate that there is a nonzero relative phase shift between amplitudes of @xmath116 and @xmath117 processes ( it is interpreted as a consequence of the @xmath118 mixing in the pion formfactor ) .",
    "to introduce the relative @xmath119 mixing phase in a phenomenological way , physical vector states of @xmath27 and @xmath26 mesons are assumed as a linear combinations of pure isospin states , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , with a complex coefficients @xcite-@xcite . the phase value is fixed by the experiment data @xcite-@xcite . to reproduce the relative phase in the model considered",
    ", we can take into account an imaginary parts of meson ( @xmath122 ) loop corrections to the vertices ( even if imaginary parts of the quark loops throw out in the `` confinement approximation '' ) .",
    "so , we can introduce the needed imaginary part , for example , into the mixing parameters . because the small relative @xmath123 phase is inessential for the processes discussed in this paper",
    ", their absolute values,@xmath124 and @xmath125 can be used instead of tree @xmath94 and @xmath126 in the superposition ( [ e:11 ] ) and also in ( [ e:12a ] ) and ( [ e:12b ] ) .",
    "if the phase is wanted for some process , the necessary phase value can be provided due to presence a sufficient number of free parameters in the scalar sector . as to the scalar meson structure ,",
    "it is possible to describe the mass spectrum and decay channels of the scalar mesons @xmath127 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath14 and @xmath15 due to presence of a sufficient number of free parameters in the sector . to illustrate this statement , in addition to ( [ e:12a ] ) we also give a part of the lagrangian which describes an interaction of the scalar mesons with @xmath18-mesons : @xmath128 this part of the lagrangian contains free coupling constants and it makes possible to describe the dominant decay channels of scalar mesons - @xmath129 and @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "the decay channel @xmath131 is not observed and from the model coupling @xmath132 it follows that @xmath133 .",
    "so , in the scalar sector the residual global @xmath10- symmetry approximately takes place after the shift .",
    "exact symmetry , @xmath134 , is not possible because it forbids the suppressed decay channel @xmath135 , which is observed experimentally . evidently , the inequality @xmath136 , violating the global isotopic @xmath10 symmetry , is related with an account of the electromagnetic interaction in the model .",
    "note , an isotriplet structure of scalar fields @xmath137 occurs in the model physical lagrangian with an accuracy up to small mixing angles , @xmath77 and @xmath62 . from initial higgs doublets with @xmath138 after the spontaneous breaking , two charged scalar combinations arise .",
    "they can be unified with the one of the residual neutral components to constitute the isotriplet , which can be identified with the isotriplet @xmath14 .",
    "to clarify this , we give @xmath139 and @xmath140 parts of the model lagrangian for zero mixing angles , @xmath77 and @xmath62 ( i. e. @xmath141 ) :    @xmath142= \\frac{i}{2}\\ , g_2\\,\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\rho^{\\mu}_{\\alpha}a_{\\beta}\\partial_{\\mu}a_{\\gamma}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here we introduced two isovectors , @xmath143 and @xmath144 . as it is seen from",
    "the folded invariant forms in ( [ e:14a ] ) , we get an exact isotriplet structure of the interaction in the zero mixing approximation",
    ". it is slightly broken by the small mixing with the singlet vector fields .",
    "radiative decays of scalars can be analyzed in the model too . at the tree level two",
    "- photon decays of scalar mesons are absent .",
    "however , these decays can be considered due to the quark and meson loops .",
    "so , the model reproduces the experimental situation in these channels ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed analysis will be given in a next paper .",
    "note , the dominant decay channel @xmath145 can be also described by introduction of an extra term , @xmath146 , into the initial lagrangian .",
    "this term is admissible by the model symmetry .    as to the interpretation of scalar states in terms of quark operators ,",
    "the problem is not solved yet finally .",
    "moreover , it is known that @xmath127 can be interpreted as a ( nearly ) gluonium state ( see , for example , @xcite-@xcite ) , and @xmath147 are not pure two - quark states .",
    "rather , they are often interpreted as a four - quark states with an admixture of gluon and/or @xmath148 components ( see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is clear that an account of the strangeness effects ( in particular , @xmath149 decay ) can not be realized in the frame of the model . to do this",
    ", the gauge symmetry should be extended at least to @xmath150 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , this problem is beyond the scope of this paper and will be considered later . to analyze radiative processes with vector mesons ,",
    "it is enough to consider now the physical lagrangian ( [ e:12a ] ) where the `` tree '' vertices are the effective on - shell constants now .",
    "note that the conception of the gauge and higgs fields components in the model provides the invariance of the physical lagrangian under the @xmath151 transformations .    because of the model two - level structure ( meson - meson and quark - meson ) , interactions at these levels are tested independently in two - particle and three - particle channels .",
    "it is seen from ( [ e:12a ] ) that the meson - meson lagrangian classifies both tree and loop level processes , while the quark - meson interactions occur in the model as loop contributions only .",
    "radiative decays of neutral vector mesons of the type @xmath152 are an object of steady attention during some decades ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and also @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "experimental investigation of these reactions and accompanied theoretical speculations contribute to the understanding of hadron intermediate states and low energy dynamic of meson interactions .    in the channels where",
    "the charged pair @xmath153 is formed , dominant contribution comes from the tree diagrams corresponding to the vector dominance approximation @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the curve ( 2 ) in fig.2 describes the spectrum normalized by the total width , @xmath162 at the tree level only , it does not depend on the model coupling constants if the total width of @xmath8-meson in the denominator is calculated with the `` tree '' values of couplings .",
    "here we used , however , the experimental value of @xmath163 , so the normalized branching depends on the @xmath78 and @xmath164 couplings .",
    "then , consider the curve ( 1 ) representing the model fit of the experimental data with the help of a single free multiplicative parameter .",
    "as it is seen , this fitted curve ( 1 ) improves the description at the photon low energy range .",
    "this improvement can be explained by an account of @xmath165 dependence of couplings ( i.e. an introduction of corresponding off - shell formfactors with the fixed value of np parameter @xmath74 ) . if we consider these formfactors , and the spectrum is normalized on the theoretical @xmath163 , the answer depends on the ratio of @xmath166 formfactors at the different energy scales .",
    "more exactly , in the denominator ( @xmath163 ) this effective coupling is defined on the mass shell of final pions . at the same time , @xmath166 for the spectrum @xmath167 is the `` running coupling '' ( formfactor ) because intermediate pion is off - shell ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "a small correction can arise from the electromagnetic @xmath164- formfactor too .",
    "totally , as it follows from the fit , this multiplicative parameter increases the ratio no more than @xmath168 , due to the formfactors contribution which is approximately @xmath169 .    however , this improvement is ambiguous because of a large uncertainties in calculated and experimental photon spectrum at low energies ( an accurate account of soft photons is important too ) .",
    "note , also , that branching for the decay , which is defined by the curve ( 1 ) , agrees with the experiment data worse than the branching following from the curve ( 2 ) . to describe the spectrum fine structure near @xmath170",
    ", it was suggested to consider the loop corrections ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which , certainly , do not contribute to the formfactors . in any case",
    ", this consideration is reasonable only if the more detailed and reliable experimental data on the photon spectrum are available .",
    "integration of ( [ e:2 ] ) from @xmath171 up to @xmath172 gives the value of partial @xmath8- meson branching @xmath173 which slightly exceeds the experimental value @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "an account of the loop contributions ( with the phenomenological couplings ) leads to the result : @xmath175  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there is some discrepancy between the experimental branching and the one following from the integration of spectrum ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "namely , an excess of @xmath176 over @xmath177 can be caused by the deviation of the theoretical spectrum from the experimental one at the energy @xmath178 , where there are large uncertainty , and at energy range @xmath179 , where the measurements are absent .",
    "so , to test a more detailed model predictions we need in a more precise experimental data .",
    "decay characteristics of the process @xmath180 at the tree level are computed analogously with the following replacement in ( [ e:1 ] ) - ( [ e:3 ] ) : @xmath181 in @xmath182 , and @xmath183 in @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "the partial width for the decay is damped by the small mixing parameter , @xmath186 , so we have @xmath187 and @xmath188 for @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "these estimations do not contradict to the experimental restriction @xmath191  @xcite and agree with the theoretical results of  @xcite .",
    "thus , the same set of the fixed parameters ( the gauge `` tree '' constant and two mixing angles ) describes two different decays which arise at the ( tree ) level .",
    "certainly , loop corrections can be important for the @xmath192 decays due to the smallness of the tree contribution ( see , for example  @xcite , @xcite ) . in an analogy with the results of these papers",
    ", loop corrections can increase @xmath193 up to @xmath194 , which does not contradict again to the upper limit of the experiment .",
    "as it was noted above , an account of the loop corrections to the decay @xmath195 tree width ( see @xcite and @xcite-@xcite ) was intended to describe the photon spectrum fine structure .",
    "however , it increases the discrepancy between the model and experimental values of the total width .",
    "quantitatively , this effect depends on the underlying model .",
    "moreover , in effective theories an account of loop diagrams ( for the tree level processes ) has some additional subtleties connected with the compensation of divergencies and renormalizability . for the processes which take place at the loop level only , these problems are absent  all divergencies are summed to zero when all external lines are on the mass shell @xcite .",
    "an examples of such loop processes will be given in the next section .",
    "the usage of parameters from ( [ e:13 ] ) together with the constants @xmath196 and @xmath197 extracted from the widths of @xmath198 and @xmath199 decays , leads to the correct estimation of the cross section in the peak vicinity , @xmath200 .",
    "as it was noted above , the tree approximation does not describe the resonance curve in this region in details . for the detailed consideration , a relative @xmath123 phase",
    "should be included , but it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in the most papers these decays are defined by the phenomenological vertices which are introduced at the tree level @xcite . in the quark - meson model , radiative decays @xmath201 and three - particle decays @xmath202 occur via quark loops only with the gauge ( tree ) vertices ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "remind , corresponding formfactors depending on some np parameter can be add to the tree couplings . then , if the formfactors had introduced , loop corrections of another type should be considered too .",
    "corresponding one - loop diagrams for the decays @xmath203 are shown in fig.3 , where @xmath204 denote quark fields .",
    "total amplitude for the process @xmath205 has the following form @xmath206 here @xmath207 is the color factor , vertex constant @xmath208 ( @xmath209 is the constant of @xmath210 and @xmath211 interaction , and the goldberger - treiman relation defines the coupling as @xmath212 ) . for the constituent quark mass",
    "we suppose @xmath213 .",
    "@xmath214 is here the special case of the three - point passarino - veltman function @xcite . in a general case for all incoming momenta : @xmath215 where @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 .    using an obvious form of the @xmath220 in ( [ e:4 ] )",

    "in ( [ e:5 ] ) it was used again the goldberger - treiman relation @xmath225 .",
    "then , the constituent quark mass value , which is taken here as a free parameter , can be found from the widths fit .",
    "the decay @xmath226 is described by the diagrams in fig.3 with the corresponding replacement of the coupling constant .",
    "the expression for the width is @xmath227 follows from the isotopic structure of @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 vertices ( [ e:12a])-([e:12b ] ) ( here we omit small terms proportional to @xmath231 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "both the widths are in a good agreement with the experimental data @xcite when the effective quark mass value is @xmath232 : @xmath233 thus , the fitting of two widths by one model parameter - mass of the constituent quark @xmath234 , gives @xmath235 .",
    "remind , we find the widths not in the limit of low ( zero ) external lines ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , but calculate all integrals exactly .",
    "note , this value of @xmath234 is fixed from the fit if we keep nonzero imaginary part of these amplitudes .",
    "it means , we suppose the constituent quarks can create and propagate in a np vacuum domain .",
    "in essence , instead of the known approximation of the `` naive '' confinement ( when the imaginary part of quark loop equals zero `` by hand '' - see @xcite and , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) , we suggest another `` naive '' idea : inside of the np medium real constituent quarks are created by a vector or a ( pseudo ) scalar current and as a free states they run to a distances @xmath236 before annihilation .",
    "so , these quarks can not be an asymptotic states in the model .",
    "the @xmath74 defines a scale where the np medium is capable to transform the ( real ) quark pair into the meson .",
    "possibly , the scale @xmath237 because the @xmath17-meson simulates a scalar `` gluonium '' , which effectively links quarks together in the model .",
    "the same scale @xmath74 should define the diverged parts of the vertices formfactors mediated by the quark and meson loops . as it is seen , the obtained quark mass is significantly lower than the standard value @xmath238 .",
    "the reason is the `` real '' and relatively light constituent quarks attractively interact with each other , exchanging by `` gluoniums '' ( virtual scalar and pseudoscalar meson states ) .",
    "the last ones not only contribute into the quark mass via self - energy diagrams and the quark binding at the large distances ( @xmath236 ) , but also exist outside the hadron vacuum as the real mesons .",
    "in other words , a constituent quark contains only a part of a hadron gluon component , and true gluon core inside of a np vacuum is simulated by the `` gluonium '' .",
    "so , the imaginary parts of amplitudes describe the constituent quark propagation up to the distances , where the np effects are sufficiently large to bind the quarks into a real meson .",
    "attractive forces between the quarks lead to the effective decreasing of their mass .",
    "schematically , for the nucleon and @xmath8- meson masses we can write approximately @xmath239    here,@xmath234 is an effective quark mass and @xmath240 is the mass of the same internal `` gluon '' component of meson and baryon structure , as it is supposed here . instead of explicit fundamental gluon fields , in the effective model",
    "there is @xmath17- meson , which can be interpreted as an effective scalar `` gluionium '' state with a mass close to @xmath240 .    from this system of equations",
    "it follows @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "the latest value nearly coincides with the quark mass assessment resulting from the decay channels analysis .",
    "note that quark mass value @xmath243 and the @xmath244 result from the composite - meson model with the four - quark interaction @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath240 makes it possible to interpret the meson @xmath245 as the ( mostly ) glueball , nonperturbative state @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with an ideas of the gluon nature of @xmath43 meson ( see  @xcite and references therein for the review of scalar meson properties ) . note , the @xmath43 meson was also carefully analyzed supposing it is a @xmath246 state , in  @xcite , for instance .    nevertheless , if we use the `` naive '' confinement approximation of @xcite , @xcite and set the imaginary parts of quark loops zero , from our loop calculations with the tree vertices ( not formfactors ) we get @xmath247 in agreement with the known results of quark - meson models .",
    "an account of the formfactors instead of tree values can increase the quark mass no more than @xmath86 , as we estimate .",
    "certainly , the possibility to keep nonzero imaginary part should be verified for other quark loop amplitudes , for example , for the @xmath248-formfactor .",
    "in particular , from the quark triangles analogous to that describing @xmath249 process , in the low external momenta approximation ( see @xcite , @xcite ) we get the same result as in @xcite .",
    "however , if we integrate the vertex exactly , the results in a various kinematical regions for the external momenta differ from this estimation substantially ( details will be given in a next paper )",
    ".    now let s consider the known decay @xmath22 , which is described by finite triangle quark diagrams too .",
    "direct calculation leads to the following expression for the partial decay width : @xmath250 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where again @xmath212 .",
    "@xmath251 is another special case of the scalar three - point passarino - veltman function . here",
    "the function is reduced to the form @xmath252,\\ ] ] where @xmath253 .",
    "then , from eq.([e:15a ] ) it follows numerically @xmath254 for @xmath255 . if the quark mass value @xmath256 , the width is @xmath257 . in an analogous consideration @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "the decay width in the exact chiral limit ( corresponding to axial anomaly term ) has the value : @xmath258 .",
    "note that from eq.([e:15a ] ) we get the same value in the chiral limit for the @xmath220- function .",
    "the experimental width lies in the interval @xmath259 @xcite .",
    "there are some essential aspects of this result .",
    "first , in the chiral limit , supposing a @xmath260 accuracy for the goldberger - treiman relation , the width calculated does not depend on the quark mass , and our result is coincide with the width from the paper @xcite .",
    "second , exact integration of the amplitude allows , as it would seem , to prefer the value @xmath261 , which provides a better agreement with the experimental data . some important factors , however , should be taken into account for more accurate analysis : a ) a possible violation of the goldberger - treiman relation can be as much as @xmath262 @xcite-@xcite ( it means some weak @xmath165 dependence of @xmath209 ) ; b ) as it was shown in @xcite , the @xmath263 mixing can be noticeable for the case and c ) loop corrections to @xmath264 vertex , i.e. electromagnetic formfactor for off - shell quarks can also be significant in this case .    for example , taking the quark mass equals @xmath265 and decreasing effective @xmath266 coupling by @xmath267 only , for the decay width we get @xmath268 also in a good agreement with the experiment . on the other hand , to make the theoretical width consistent with the data , it is sufficient to decrease the effective electromagnetic coupling @xmath264 no more than @xmath269 .",
    "certainly , the smallness of these contributions into the electromagnetic quark formfactor is provided by the specific value of the np scale , @xmath74 for this formfactor , which is defined by the diverged triangles of @xmath84 and @xmath83 types .",
    "this value of @xmath270 correlates with the np scale , which fixes formfactors of other effective interactions ( @xmath78 , @xmath88 ) .    and",
    "third , in this decay an imaginary part of the amplitude equals zero exactly .",
    "so , for the case we do not need in the `` naive '' quark confinement approximation @xcite , @xcite : to drop imaginary part of the quark loop amplitude .",
    "the linear sigma - model is the most popular approach for the description of low - energy hadron interaction .",
    "we have considered the gauge generalization of this model and include ( effective ) quark degrees of freedom explicitly . in the gauge scheme suggested",
    "the vector meson dominance takes place in the tree - level processes .",
    "the quark - meson sector describes some loop - level processes , when quark structure of mesons plays a noticeable role .",
    "the analysis of the model discussed is not completed yet , in particular , in the scalar sector , which is formed by the higgs degrees of freedom .",
    "we demonstrate a principal possibility to introduce scalar singlets @xmath271 and triplet @xmath14 into the gauge scheme .",
    "the structure of the scalar sector and the study of the scalar mesons decays is in preparation now .",
    "certainly , more detailed description of scalar mesons properties should be realized in @xmath150 extension . to account for the chiral partners of vector mesons , we need in the localization of the total chiral group .",
    "however , the processes , which are considered here , can be analyzed without these extensions .    using an above discussed strategy of the model parameters treatment , we estimate the vertex couplings , avoiding the double counting and keeping the gauge symmetry .",
    "then , the model was applied to some radiative decays of mesons which are intensively discussed in the literature .",
    "the decays @xmath28 and @xmath29 have been considered within the framework of the vmd gauge scheme .",
    "the results are in good accordance with the experimental data .",
    "the radiative decays @xmath272 , @xmath273 and @xmath274 are defined by the quark - meson interaction entirely , i.e. they take place at the loop level only .",
    "for these cases we get results in agreement with the experiment too .",
    "the quark mass value and `` confinement '' at the level of effective quarks are discussed .    from the analysis we fulfilled",
    ", it follows that the radiative decay rates of vector mesons can be calculated with a good accuracy within the framework of the gauge quark - meson model . in other words , quantum field approach to the vmd , supplemented by the quark - meson interaction ,",
    "is a gauge generalization of the linear sigma - model .",
