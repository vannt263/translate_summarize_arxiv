    "asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes represent holographic duals of strongly coupled conformal field theories at finite temperature , and the phase transition phenomena in those backgrounds admit an interpretation as such in the dual boundary theory too .",
    "the interpretation of hawking - page phase transition @xcite of 5-dimensional ads black holes as the phenomenon dual to the confinement / deconfinement transition in the quark - gluon plasma in 4-dimensional yang - mills theory @xcite , and the interpretation of the scalar field condensation around 4-dimensional charged ads black holes as holographic models of superconductors @xcite are two archetypical examples of this general idea .",
    "the relevance of ads black holes in the context of ads / cft correspondence @xcite motivates the seek of tractable models in which the phase transition of higher - dimensional ads black holes coupled to matter fields can be solved explicitly including backreaction .",
    "this is because having such a model would enable one to describe these critical phenomena and analogs analytically .",
    "unfortunately , coming up with such a model is difficult and the catalog of scenarios in which this is under control is actually scant .",
    "nevertheless , surprisingly , a model in which phase transitions of ads black holes in arbitrary dimension @xmath0 does admit an analytic solution is given by general relativity conformally coupled to a real scalar field @xcite .",
    "such hairy black hole solutions in arbitrary @xmath1 were recently found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see @xcite for lower - dimensional analogs ) , and it was argued in @xcite that they serve as models to study the condensation of scalar hair around an asymptotically ads black hole including the backreaction of the field on the metric : above certain critical temperature , the theory undergoes a phase transition whose endpoint turns out to be an asymptotically ads black hole with a scalar field configuration that is regular everywhere outside and on the horizon @xcite . however , the example considered in @xcite failed to model the condensation of the scalar field at low temperature , and it rather exhibited such a transition only at high temperature .",
    "this motivates us to try to modify the ultra - violet behavior of the solution of @xcite in such a way of inducing a phase transition at low temperature .",
    "a natural idea to do so is to charge the hairy black hole under a gauge field : in dimension @xmath1 , this would yield a matter - energy contribution that , at short distance , would dominate over the conformally coupled matter and probably reinforce the backreaction in such a way that a new phase transition actually takes place . as we will see , this intuition turns out to be correct : the simplest scenario to achieve scalar field condensation at low temperature turns out to be coupling the theory of @xcite to a @xmath2 gauge field in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "we will see that the inclusion of charge to the hairy ads black holes of @xcite reinforces the backreaction at short distances in such a way that it triggers a new type of instability at low temperature .",
    "the inclusion of electric charge is also natural from the holographic point of view : within the context of ads / cft , the inclusion of a @xmath2 field in the bulk corresponds to the inclusion of finite chemical potential .",

    "the action of the theory is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the 5-dimensional newton constant .",
    "we will consider @xmath7 , although solutions with the other sign of the cosmological constant are permitted too @xcite .",
    "apart from the cosmological einstein - hilbert and maxwell terms , the theory includes a conformal field theory contribution : the lagrangian density @xmath8 corresponds to the most general action for a real scalar field conformally coupled to gravity that results in second order field equations .",

    "we see from ( [ g2 ] ) that @xmath33 can be thought of as the _ charge _ of the black hole under the scalar field .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth emphasizing that @xmath33 is neither a charge nor hair in the usual sense , as it may only take discrete values , with its absolute value being fixed in terms of the coupling constants . in the case",
    "@xmath40 the solution reduces to the reissner - nordstrm solution in 5-dimensional ads space . in all cases ,",
    "the solution asymptotes to ads at large distance .",
    "the solution for the gauge field takes the electric form @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",

    "while the electric charge of the black hole is given by @xmath31 , its charge under the scalar field is given by @xmath44 .",
    "unlike the former , the net value of the latter charge is fixed in terms of the coupling constants . however , since in particular it can be zero , it has to be regarded as a discrete charge parameter that controls the intensity of the scalar field , which is given by @xmath14 .    apart from the planck length @xmath45 , the problem has three different characteristic length scales that are relevant , namely @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the physical interpretation of these scales is what ultimately enables us to identify a region of the parameter space that yields the desirable critical phenomenon .",
    "while @xmath49 controls the physics of ads black holes at large distances , the interplay between the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 is responsible for the critical behavior of small black holes .    for some ranges of the parameters ,",
    "the solution represents a black hole . due to the form of the metric function ( [ g2 ] ) , these black holes behave as reissner - nordstrm black holes in ads at large distance",
    "however , provided @xmath50 , their behavior is qualitatively different from the general relativity solutions at short distances .",
    "for instance , as observed in @xcite for the uncharged ( _ i.e. _ @xmath51 ) black holes , the case with @xmath52 can present hawking temperature arbitrarily low in ads space and positive specific heat even for small black holes .",
    "we will see here that , in the case of electrically charged solutions , this is also the case for solutions with @xmath53 . in @xcite ,",
    "the solutions with @xmath53 were regarded as pathological due to unphysical behaviors they exhibit at very short distance , such as negative mass configurations .",
    "this was physically interpreted in @xcite as the contribution @xmath54 in the stress - tensor to violate the energy conditions when @xmath33 is positive .",
    "however , here we will show that when the solution is electrically charged such pathologies disappear , even for small charge values .",
    "this is due to the new contribution @xmath55 in the stress - tensor , which is in @xmath1 dimensions is dominant for black holes with small horizons .",
    "the horizons of the black hole ( [ g1])-([g2 ] ) are given by the positive zeroes of the equation @xmath56 ; that is , the positive roots of the polynomial @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "as for the reissner - nordstrm black hole in ads space , the solution above may present inner and outer horizons .",
    "the location of these horizons , denoted @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively , depend on @xmath33 .",
    "two horizons may exist both for positive and negative values of @xmath33 .",
    "the extremal solution corresponds to the case where both horizons coincide , @xmath61 ; this happens when @xmath62    to compute the conserved charges associated to the black hole solution above one may resort to the regge - teitelboim approach in the minisuperspace .",
    "this amounts to consider the ansatz ( [ g1 ] ) and vary the action functional @xmath63 , integrated in a finite time interval @xmath64 , with respect to the shift function @xmath65 and the function @xmath66 .",
    "this yields the value @xmath67 for the mass , and the value @xmath68 for the electric charge , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 are two integration constants .",
    "these results for the conserved charges are re - obtained in the euclidean action formalism where the constants @xmath69 and @xmath70 are found to be zero .",
    "this corresponds to choose ads@xmath71 space as the zero - mass configuration .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable choice .",
    "nevertheless , let us point out that , in some cases , assigning @xmath72 to the ads configuration is not necessary the correct answer .",
    "for instance , in three - dimensional gravity , ads@xmath73 space has actually mass given by @xmath74 ; this is due to the existence of a gap in the black hole spectrum .",
    "one can also find natural to assign the zero mass value to the extremal configuration in some cases .",
    "the hawking temperature associated to the black hole ( [ g1])-([g2 ] ) is given by @xmath75    this value vanishes in the extremal case . in the limit @xmath76 , this reproduces the result for the ads reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "notice that , at certain scales , the contribution that depends on @xmath33 competes with the one that depends on the electric charge @xmath31 . in the case",
    "@xmath51 , the short distance behavior is governed by the @xmath33-dependent term in ( [ t ] ) .",
    "because of that , the temperature of small black holes with @xmath77 diverges .",
    "in contrast , when the electric charge is non - vanishing , the black holes with @xmath53 shares the qualitative behavior of those with @xmath78 at short distance , in the sense that the specific heat changes its sign for small black holes .",
    "for the same reason , one observes from ( [ gasmasa ] ) that the electrically charged solutions with @xmath53 do not exhibit the negative mass spectrum pathology diagnosed in @xcite for the case @xmath79 .",
    "the result for the temperature ( [ t ] ) enables one to consider the euclidean action formalism .",
    "here , we are concerned with the ensemble with fixed charge , and analyze the system at fixed temperature and volume ( the gravitational potential of ads acts as finite - volume reservoir ) .",
    "then , we are interested in the helmholtz free energy @xmath80 . in the semi - classical approximation",
    "this is given by @xmath81 with the period in the euclidean time given by @xmath82 .",
    "the result reads @xmath83    it is worth mentioning that the euclidean action computation of the free energy @xmath84 involves a regularization of the infrared divergence , which can be achieved by background substraction in the standard way ; that is , regularizing with respect to the thermal ads@xmath71 configuration ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in the euclidean action formalism",
    ", the mass is obtained by @xmath85 which agrees with ( [ gasm ] ) for @xmath86 .",
    "analogously , the entropy is given by @xmath87 which can be written as @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "while the first term on the right hand side realizes the bekenstein - hawking area law , the second term is an additive contribution that only depends on @xmath43 and so it only contributes to the entropy of solutions with @xmath90 .",
    "the existence of a additive contribution to the area law in ( [ a ] ) is not a surprise due to the higher - curvature terms couplings in the action , and this contribution will be of crucial importance in our discussion .",
    "the fact that the second term on the right hand side of ( [ a ] ) does not depend on @xmath91 is a direct consequence of the fact that the scalar matter contribution is conformal invariant .",
    "from the result for @xmath84 one can compare the free energy associated to the different ads black hole solutions in relation to that of the thermal ads space .",
    "we are interested in the problem at fixed temperature and fixed effective volume , the latter being provided by ads space ; and we also consider the problem at fixed electric charge . therefore , negative values of ( [ ffromi ] ) correspond to thermodynamically favored configurations relative to thermal ads .",
    "the black hole solution presented here exhibits a rich parameter space , with two continuous variables ( _ i.e. _ @xmath32 , @xmath31 ) and one discrete variable ( _ i.e. _ @xmath92 ) , which seems difficult to explore exhaustively .",
    "however , the physical interpretation of the characteristic length scales involved in the problem ( _ i.e. _ @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ) permits to make an educated search and identify regions of the parameter space in which the critical phenomenon at low temperature actually takes place .",
    "see for instance the figure below , corresponding to the values of the parameters specified in the epigraph : as in @xcite , one verifies the existence of a phase transition at high temperature , which yields a hairy black hole solution with @xmath78 provided @xmath93 is higher than certain critical value .",
    "this is seen from the fact that , at high temperature , the lowest free energy corresponds to the solution with negative values of @xmath33 .    ) as a function of the temperature ( @xmath93 ) corresponding to the values @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 . at high @xmath93",
    "the dominant configuration corresponds to the black hole with @xmath78 . at low @xmath93 , a branch with negative entropy configurations appears . ]",
    "phase transitions from thermal ads to black hole configurations correspond to the points at which the curve of @xmath84 as a function of @xmath93 intersects the axis @xmath98 .",
    "the novel feature that the electrically charged solution presented here exhibits is that , in addition to the high @xmath93 phase transition , the system exhibits a crossing point at low temperature .",
    "this is illustrated by the point d in the figure above .",
    "this is due to the fact that small black holes with @xmath99 change the sign of their specific heat at a critical size governed by the scales @xmath100 and @xmath47 .",
    "this is expressed by the cusp at the point b in the figure ( the line ab and the cusp at b disappear when @xmath51 ) . the configurations on the line ab correspond to solutions with negative entropy .",
    "this strange feature occurs in higher - curvature theories @xcite , and it is due to the contribution of the second term on the right hand side of ( [ a ] ) . in @xcite",
    "the existence of negative entropy configurations was interpreted as a type of instability .",
    "notice that the term of the free energy ( [ ffromi ] ) that dominates at short scales goes like @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , provided the electric charge is non zero , the thermodynamically favored configuration at low temperature is a hairy black hole with positive @xmath33 .    in summary ,",
    "the coupling of the hairy black hole solutions to a @xmath2 gauge field reinforces the backreaction at short distances in such a way that it triggers a new phase transition type instability at low temperature , and this suggests that the endpoint of the transition corresponds to a black hole in ads space with non - vanishing scalar field configuration .",
    "this provides a tractable model to study the phase transition of hairy black holes in ads space in which the backreaction on the geometry can be solved analytically .",
