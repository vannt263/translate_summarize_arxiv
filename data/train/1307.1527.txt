    "the three most abundant solid phase molecular species in the interstellar medium ( ism ) are h@xmath1o , co@xmath1 , and co. the strongest absorptions of all three species are seen in the 2.5  ",
    "5  @xmath0 m region of the spectrum , associated with the stretching mode vibrations of each molecule .",
    "akari was the first space telescope since iso with which it was possible to make spectroscopic observations of the full near infrared ( nir ) range . compared with _",
    "spitzer _ or ground - based observations , akari spectroscopy offers two distinct advantages : simultaneous observation of the stretching mode absorption bands of h@xmath1o , co@xmath1 , and co , and observation of the blue wing of the h@xmath1o stretching mode absorption .",
    "two further benefits of akari are slitless spectroscopy , with spectra simultaneously captured for all objects in the field of view , and exceptional sensitivity , allowing observation of ice spectra on lines of sight towards objects with fluxes approaching 1  mjy .",
    "we present a study of the 2.5  5  @xmath0 m ice absorption spectra towards background stars and young stellar objects ( ysos ) with akari . to date , very few spectroscopic ice studies with akari have been published ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reflecting the difficulty of reducing akari spectral data . in all previous observations ,",
    "ice spectra were derived from a single , relatively bright , object in the field of view . to study background star ice spectra ,",
    "we have extracted data from multiple faint objects in a single observation , requiring the development of a unique data reduction pipeline .",
    "the ultimate aim of our akari observing programme is to map the spatial distribution of the key ice species h@xmath1o , co@xmath1 , and co. a prerequisite , however , is a robust data reduction and analysis method , to ensure the reliable determination of molecular ice column densities over hundreds of objects concurrently .",
    "the first aim of this article is to detail this analysis process .",
    "these data enhance the sample of ice spectra towards background stars and low mass ysos ; our second aim is to test how the chemical processes governing ice formation and evolution are related .    the chemistry of co , co@xmath1 , and h@xmath1o in molecular clouds is intrinsically linked .",
    "solid h@xmath1o is the dominant interstellar ice species , seemingly ubiquitous in the dense , molecular ism @xcite .",
    "this h@xmath1o forms on the surface of silicate dust grains @xcite , most likely through a combination of reactions involving h atoms , o atoms , and oh radicals .",
    "gas phase co is highly abundant in molecular clouds and is commonly used to trace astrophysical conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , unlike h@xmath1o , co accretes onto icy grain surfaces at a rate proportional to the gas density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in a co - rich ice layer .",
    "subsequently , as a function of time , temperature , or other energetic inputs to the ice mantle , the h@xmath1o and co layers can mix , producing a second co ice environment , as illustrated by previous experimental @xcite and observational @xcite work .",
    "both of these co ice environments have been detected in interstellar observations @xcite .",
    "co@xmath1 is believed to form in the solid phase , based upon its low gas phase abundances @xcite .",
    "co@xmath1 ice has been observed towards numerous interstellar environments , including low mass ysos @xcite and background stars @xcite .",
    "laboratory experiments prove that co@xmath1 formation is effective via several energetic @xcite and purely thermal @xcite mechanisms .",
    "recent results imply that the reaction co + oh occurs in competition with h@xmath1o formation ( via h + oh ) , and that some co molecules freeze - out from the gas phase long before co ice is formed .",
    "such postulations can only be tested through concurrent observations of co , co@xmath1 , and h@xmath1o ices .",
    "any sample of ice spectra observed to date has been , necessarily , dictated by both the spectral range and sensitivity of ir telescopes .",
    "low mass ysos have therefore been rather more extensively studied than background stars , beginning with limited iso observations @xcite .",
    "_ spitzer _ , more sensitive than iso , observed many more low mass ysos ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "legacy program `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' ( c2d ) extensively detailed the abundances of co@xmath1 @xcite , h@xmath1o @xcite , ch@xmath4 @xcite , and nh@xmath5 @xcite ices towards a sample of 41 low mass ysos , providing the largest dataset of column density values for these key interstellar molecules @xcite .",
    "an important conclusion of this survey is that the abundances of the major ice species are remarkably similar in different star forming regions , although , for reasons not yet fully determined , the ice composition of minor and volatile species varies extensively .",
    "this suggests that ices form in the quiescent ism , a region probed by ice spectra towards background stars .",

    "the three distinct h@xmath1o profiles identified were : type 1 , in which the red wing is weak compared to the absorption peak at 3  @xmath0 m ; type 2 , in which the long wavelength feature is relatively strong , i.e. a separate shoulder ; and type 3 , containing no ( or very little ) red contribution at all .",
    "similar effects were noted by @xcite , who found two h@xmath1o band profiles in the spectra of intermediate mass ysos in vela : one where the extended red wing was weak relative to the h@xmath1o ice band , and a second where it was stronger . as in @xcite , within each subset of objects the h@xmath1o bands show remarkably similar profiles .",
    "the question is , what are the likely origins of these profile differences ? do these profiles represent distinct physical environments , or have we , rather , sampled a continuum of red wing profiles ?",
    "type 3 is seen only in the spectra of objects 10 and 12 , both of which are background stars and have low spectral flux ( @xmath3  12  mjy at all wavelengths observed ) .",
    "no previous observations exist of h@xmath1o bands without an extended red wing emission .",
    "for these bands , a cde - corrected pure h@xmath1o spectrum appears to fully fit the observed data .",
    "type 2  present in the spectra of objects  1 , 13 , 21 , 22 , 25 and 30 , a sample of only background stars  appears to contain a distinct red shoulder , as opposed to the usual extended red wing .",
    "type 1  present in the spectra of objects  2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 14 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 27 , 28 and 29 , a mixture of ysos and background stars  resembles the `` standard '' water band observed towards many lines of sight @xcite .",
    "the origins of the extended long wavelength feature on the water ice band have often been debated .",
    "a number of suggestions have been made as to its origin , including : the interaction of light with dust grains ( as discussed in ",
    "[ sec - colden ] ) , with the depth and profile of the band changing with grain size , shape , or even as a function of ice mantle thickness @xcite ; an absorption band at 3.54  @xmath0 m , attributed to the c - h stretch of methanol , ch@xmath5oh @xcite ; and aliphatic and aromatic c - h stretches associated with various molecular sources , including polyaromatic hydrocarbons @xcite , larger organic molecules @xcite and the grains themselves @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that , although their sample is statistically limited , a strong correlation is evident between the water ice column density and the optical depth of the extended red wing at 3.25  @xmath0 m , concluding that the carriers of the red wing are directly related to the ice mantle .",
    "a previous study by @xcite also finds a strong correlation between av and the optical depth of the extended red wing at 3.47  @xmath0 m .",
    "neither of these correlations is evident in our data .",
    "however , in comparing the average h@xmath1o ice column densities across types 1 , 2 , and 3 , a clear trend emerges : the column density of h@xmath1o ice in type 3 sources is @xmath41  2.6 times lower than type 1 ; type 2 is @xmath41  1.5 times lower than type 1 .",
    "given that types 3 and 2 only contain background stars whereas type 1 also includes ysos it appears that the profile and depth of the extended red wing could potentially prove to be a reliable evolutionary marker .",
    "within type 1 , whilst the band profiles are identical , the average h@xmath1o ice column densities differ by a factor of 1.7 between the subset of yso objects and the subset of background stars . in comparison ,",
    "the ratio of average column densities between the yso subset in type 1 and the type 2 background stars is 1.9 .",
    "the objects of @xcite were all class i ysos ; the average h@xmath1o column densities associated with their type 1 profile ( i.e. the `` standard '' water band ) is identical to ours ( 2.5  @xmath12  0.9 @xmath10  10@xmath43 , and 2.1  @xmath12  0.5 @xmath10  10@xmath43 molecules @xmath37 , respectively ) .",
    "this provides statistical evidence suggesting that the h@xmath1o band profile also changes with the column density of ice in a particular line of sight .",
    "it has previously been observed that the water ice abundance ( h@xmath1o / h@xmath1 ) in molecular cores increases with dust density at low a@xmath29 @xcite , before reaching a plateau @xcite .",
    "some evidence exists of a further jump in water ice abundance at densities of a few @xmath10  10@xmath44  @xmath45 h@xmath1 , which has been attributed to the removal of one or more water destruction pathways @xcite . from our calculated column densities ,",
    "it is likely that the ysos observed in our survey probe lines of sight with densities near to the plateau , i.e. regions where grain growth and accelerated freeze - out have occurred , whereas the lines of sight towards background stars probe the density - abundance slope at lower densities , similarly to previous observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the evolutionary path from background stars ( probing low density molecular clouds or pre - stellar cores ) to class i low - mass ysos",
    ", it appears that both the grain radii and the ice mantle thickness increase .",
    "however , previous attempts to fully account for the extended red wing with this postulate have failed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observational evidence from other ice species also points towards fundamental differences in the dust present in diffuse and dense ism regions @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the h@xmath1o band of type 3 objects is fully fitted with a cde - corrected h@xmath1o ice profile , suggesting that only h@xmath1o contributes to this absorption feature .",
    "the column densities of h@xmath1o towards these lines of sight are relatively low , with values of 0.7 @xmath10  10@xmath43 and 0.9 @xmath10  10@xmath43 molecules @xmath37 for objects 10 and 12 , respectively . in type 2 objects , the main h@xmath1o band centred at @xmath41 3  @xmath0 m is equally well accounted for by a cde model as the h@xmath1o observed towards type 3 objects , but the column densities of h@xmath1o are , on average , 1.8 times greater .",
    "the water ice band does not have an extended red wing , but rather a distinct shoulder redward of the h@xmath1o band , attributed to additional molecular species present in the ice .",
    "type 2 objects thus likely probe lines of sight towards more evolved regions of molecular cores where surface chemistry has resulted in the formation of species such as ch@xmath5oh , or the hydrogenation of carbon on the grain surface , producing c - h bonds which absorb in this wavelength region .",
    "one further alternative , not widely discussed in the literature , is that on such lines of sight the nitrogen chemistry has evolved , forming nh@xmath5 or at least nh@xmath1 functional groups .",
    "the stretching modes of these transitions would appear close to the h@xmath1o absorption ( e.g. n - h stretching mode of nh@xmath5 at 2.96  @xmath0 m and amides in the region 2.70  ",
    "3.30  @xmath0 m ) .",
    "however , for nh@xmath5 ( at least ) , such transitions would also be accompanied by features associated with the bending and umbrella modes of nh@xmath5 at 6.16 and 9.00  @xmath0 m , respectively @xcite ; these wavelengths lie outside the nir region probed by these akari observations , so no further analysis is possible here .",
    "finally , type 1 objects display the `` standard '' h@xmath1o band profile with an extended red wing ; the distinct shoulder seen in type 2 is still likely to be present ( and thus the additional carriers and molecular species remain ) but is now subsumed by effects in the broad red wing of the oh stretching absorption band .",
    "the average h@xmath1o ice column density on these lines of sight is greater than those of types 3 and 2 .",
    "however , as the fits show , this increase in column density alone can not account for the changes in the red wing profile between types 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "some change in the scattering properties of the ice must also occur , e.g. grain growth and mantle growth occur concurrently .",
    "the profile of the red wing on lines of sight towards ysos is usually attributed to grain growth , accompanied by accelerated freeze - out , which is known to occur in dense cores and regions surrounding ysos , where the density is high enough for the freeze - out timescale to become shorter than the age of the core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is very interesting , therefore , that type 1 includes both ysos and background stars , although the reasons for this have not yet been fully ascertained .",
    "one possibility is that background stars exhibiting this h@xmath1o band profile probe lines of sight through regions of a core that are close to an existing yso , and are thus probing ices and grains which are at a later evolutionary stage than those probed by background stars exhibiting type 2 profiles .",
    "however , from our data this does not seem to be the case .",
    "most of the background star subset of type 1 are either isolated objects , or lie in fields of view containing only background stars . in the only fields of view containing a yso and a background star ( l  1165 , objects 28 ( yso ) and 29 , and lm226 , objects 26 ( yso ) and 25 ) , the pattern is unclear , as object 29 is of type 1 , but object 25 is of type 2 .",
    "perhaps , rather , the background stars in type 1 also probe regions which are more evolved , and are about to undergo star formation , suggesting that proximity to a yso is not the only observational indicator of evolutionary state .    a number of studies have tried to reproduce the extended red wing profile of the h@xmath1o band using mie scattering with an encapsulated grain , changing grain size and mantle thickness @xcite . given that our type 3 and 2 profiles do fit with a cde grain shape model , we opted to continue using the cde fitting with the type 1 profile .",
    "perhaps a scattering model which took into account the evolution of the ice mantle as well as grain growth would be able to more accurately model the changing profile of h@xmath1o bands during the evolution from a molecular cloud to a yso .",
    "the most obvious and widely published candidate molecule to account for the h@xmath1o band shoulders in types 2 and 1 is ch@xmath5oh .",
    "it has previously been observed towards multiple lines of sight including both low mass ysos and background stars @xcite .",
    "as the focus of this article is the analysis and quantification of the h@xmath1o , co@xmath1 and co ice absorption features , further analysis of the h@xmath1o red wing was not performed .",
    "this issue will be addressed in a future article ( suutarinen et al , in preparation ) .",
    "[ [ co ] ] co ~~    the original aim of these observations with akari was to determine the relative column densities of h@xmath1o , co@xmath1 , and co ices , with a view to mapping ices across molecular clouds . given the low spectral resolution of akari , it was not anticipated that the absorption features would be fully resolved , and thus a component fitting method was not envisioned .",
    "however , the profiles of the co bands observed are well enough resolved that fitting components is viable .",
    "the fitting methodology for co was developed by consideration of various possible methods , the most crucial of which are illustrated in figure  [ fig - cogg1 ] . the primary co feature ( 2160  2120 cm@xmath14 )",
    "contains only nine or ten data points , while the akari instrumental profile contains 10 data points .",
    "these data are thus below the nyquist limit for data sampling , and we expect the co feature to be undersampled",
    ". a single component fit of pure co to the primary co feature using a lab spectrum ( with applied cde model , akari instrumental profile and resolution correction ) ( figure  [ fig - cogg1]a ) was discounted as the wings were poorly fitted",
    ". a two component fit of pure co and co in a water environment ( middle component , co@xmath46 , and red component , co@xmath47 , @xcite ) , similar to that first described by @xcite , well described the main co feature , especially the wings ( figure  [ fig - cogg1]b ) , with the reduced chi - squared statistic improving for 74  % of spectra .",
    "however , it did not account for the 2160    2180 cm@xmath14 feature , nor the slight excess in the red wing of the co feature .",
    "previous akari observations showed that gas phase co rovibrational lines might also be present concurrently with the co ice feature @xcite at least on lines of sight towards the edge - on disks they observed . at the akari resolution , these gas phase lines are not resolved , but the possibility of major gas phase co features in absorption was considered , and rejected , based upon a series of model gas phase spectra , one of which is shown in figure  [ fig - cogg1]c . clearly the gas phase features peak where the ice features do not , even at the akari resolution , and they can not account for the extended red wing on the akari co ice features . we conclude that there is very little , if any , gas phase co contribution in our spectra , and do not include a gas phase component in our fit .",
    "the feature between 2160    2180 cm@xmath14 , which is usually attributed to ocn@xmath48 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is included in the overall fit for completeness , although the minor components contributing to this feature are not discussed further in this work . in our spectra , the feature can usually only be fully accounted for by including both an ocn@xmath2 component and the so - called co@xmath49 , co gas - grain , feature @xcite , as illustrated by @xcite .",
    "co@xmath49 represents gas phase co that chemisorbs directly to the bare grain surface during or before formation of the underlying h@xmath1o ice mantle @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig - cogg1]d , the ocn@xmath48 feature alone is not able to fully complete the fit and so , as illustrated in figure  [ fig - cogg1]e , we use both components here . the inclusion of the secondary feature ( 2160",
    "  2180 cm@xmath14 ) to the fit makes no difference to the calculated co column densities for all spectra from which co values were calculated ( nor for 80  % of upper limit values ) .",
    "ultimately , our co ice band fitting was based on a modified version of the well - established four component analysis of @xcite . in our analysis ,",
    "co@xmath47 is replaced by a gaussian calculated from laboratory data @xcite , but co@xmath46 is retained as in @xcite ( a cde - corrected lorentzian at 2139  cm@xmath14 ) . the third co component from @xcite",
    "is omitted , not because it is not necessarily present , but because , given the akari resolution , there is no need to add additional components to a fit , where two components suffice . that only two components are required to fit the main co feature ( co@xmath46 and co@xmath47 )",
    "supports our assertions that arf , and in particular the stacking method , was appropriate for analysis of these data .",
    "the 2160    2180 cm@xmath14 feature , ( the fourth component in the @xcite method ) , was fitted by a gaussian derived from laboratory ocn@xmath48 spectra by @xcite .",
    "in addition , a laboratory spectrum of co gas chemisorbed on a zeolite surface ( ( co@xmath49 , * ? ? ? * ) ) was added to the model , to fit the outlying absorption feature centred at 2175  cm@xmath14 .",
    "co@xmath46 is cde corrected to account for grain shape effects , and the sum of all components is corrected for the akari instrumental line profile .",
    "one key element of the multi - component fitting in @xcite is that all the components are used to fit all the observed spectra , changing only the relative intensities of each component from one line of sight to another .",
    "this is the premise we also adopt here .",
    "the fits of co are presented in figure  [ fig - od-3a ] .",
    "where there is no data in a plot , it is because no data was extracted in this region of the spectrum ( e.g. object  1 )",
    ". where there is only a partial data extraction , the plot is shown , but no fit was made to the data ( e.g. object  11 ) .",
    "interestingly , it is very clear from figure  [ fig - od-3a ] that in at least two objects  objects 4 and object 20  the co ice main peak is fully described by a single pure co component ( co@xmath46 ) .",
    "in fact as table  [ tbl-3 ] shows , up to nine objects fit into this category .",
    "conversely , in objects 8 and 18 , the co ice is fully fitted by only the co@xmath47 . however both these objects provide only upper limits on the co ice column densities , and the identification of a single co ice component is much less compelling than for objects 4 and 20 . given that co ice is formed in low temperature cores ,",
    "where co gas critically freezes - out as densities increase , it is perhaps not surprising to observe objects with only pure co ice present . as the temperature of a core increases ( usually due to the formation of a yso ) , this pure co ice is expected to either desorb or migrate into the pores of the underlying water ice , giving rise to the co@xmath47 @xcite . in the laboratory",
    "it is only possible to detect the spectral feature associated with the co@xmath47 at elevated temperatures @xcite , but it seems unlikely that the lines of sight probed here are particularly warm .",
    "the origins of the co@xmath47 therefore remain debatable , as illustrated recently by @xcite .",
    "the column density of co for the pure component , co@xmath46 , is calculated by : @xmath50 where a@xmath51 = 1.1  @xmath10  10@xmath52  cm molec@xmath14 is the band strength of the bulk material , and @xmath53 is the optical depth at maximum absorption ( equation  3 , @xcite ) .",
    "n(co@xmath47 ) and n(ocn@xmath2 ) are calculated using equation  ( [ eqn : colden ] ) , with band strengths a@xmath47 = 1.1  @xmath10  10@xmath52  cm molec@xmath14 @xcite and a@xmath54 = 1.3  @xmath10  10@xmath42  cm molec@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the column density of the co gas - grain population is calculated by : @xmath55 where a@xmath51 = 4.0  @xmath10  10@xmath56  cm molec@xmath14 is the band strength of the bulk material @xcite , and @xmath57 is the optical depth at maximum absorption .",
    "all column densities calculated for co@xmath47 , co@xmath46 , ocn@xmath2 , and co@xmath49 are presented in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "it should be noted that a@xmath51 is calculated based upon laboratory spectra of a particular ice , using estimations for the parameters of ice thickness and number of molecules on the surface . if astrophysical ices differ in mixture or concentration , the relationship between optical depth and molecular abundance will change , and",
    "thus the relative concentration of one component to another will differ with respect to the values calculated here .",
    "this caveat holds for any interstellar ice column density analysis .",
    "ocn@xmath2 was believed to be formed around ysos , based upon upper limits established by studies of background stars @xcite which suggested that ocn@xmath2 is not found in quiescent clouds .",
    "however , more recent studies have revealed stricter upper limits on ocn@xmath2 towards background stars probing quiescent regions @xcite . as is evident with reference to table  [ tbl-3 ] , an ocn@xmath2 component was fitted towards very few lines of sight ( five ysos and two background stars , all but one of which were upper limits ) .",
    "the co@xmath1 stretching mode is a very deep absorption feature and therefore it can easily become saturated ; it is suspected that this is the case here .",
    "a second challenge in fitting the co@xmath1 ice region at the akari resolution limits , is that across the whole feature there are only 18",
    "  19 data points , which means that the line is not necessarily fully sampled , and potentially that the observed peak position in the spectrum is not coincident with the actual peak absorption .",
    "this also means that it is impossible to fit the co@xmath1 bands with the wings only , unlike in the case of h@xmath1o .",
    "furthermore , like the co@xmath1 bending mode at 15.2  @xmath0 m , the stretching mode of co@xmath1 is very sensitive to the ice mixture , temperature , and other properties , as demonstrated by a number of laboratory experiments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . consequently ,",
    "when fitting the co@xmath1 stretching mode there are a wide range of potential fitting parameters and degenerate solutions .",
    "it is clear from previous akari studies that quantification of co@xmath1 abundances using akari spectra is challenging .",
    "@xcite calculated the co@xmath1 abundance towards massive ysos in the large magellanic cloud as @xmath41  36  % relative to h@xmath1o using a curve of growth method . in observations of co@xmath1 ice on lines of sight towards edge - on disks , @xcite , determining abundances from the integration of a fitted laboratory spectrum , found co@xmath1/h@xmath1o ratios broadly consistent with those published previously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "of course , such differences may be wholly attributable to the types of objects observed  extragalactic yso sources in the case of @xcite ; ice in edge - on yso envelopes and disks in the case of @xcite , where the collapse may have occurred so rapidly that less co freeze - out led to less co@xmath1 formation .",
    "in the two cases cited , co@xmath1 column densities were calculated using a single laboratory component or a curve of growth method . in this work",
    ", we will fit our data with a two component model , to make better fits to the co@xmath1 stretching absorption .",
    "given that previous detailed _ spitzer _ observations have established , from the bending mode feature , that co@xmath1 exists in two environments ( a water - rich ice and a carbon monoxide - rich ice ) towards ysos @xcite and background stars @xcite , it was decided to fit the feature with two laboratory spectra : a co@xmath1:h@xmath1o 14:100 ice at 10  k @xcite and a co@xmath1:co 1:1 ice at 15  k @xcite .",
    "a kramers - kronig analysis @xcite , followed by a cde grain shape model and the akari instrumental line profile were applied to both laboratory spectra before fitting the peak ( excluding the central four data points , as they might not fully describe the maximum absorption ) . from figure  [ fig - od-2a ] , it is clear that the strategy fits the observed data well , including the peak . where there is saturation of the co@xmath1 band , this is also reflected by the fitting , with the wings well described but the final fit illustrating the significant undersampling in the akari data .",
    "the reduced chi - squared statistics were improved for all but one spectrum ( 97  % ) when comparing a two - component fit to fitting a single laboratory spectrum , further justifying our choice of fitting methodology .",
    "column densities were calculated using equation  ( [ eqn : colden ] ) with a  =  7.6  @xmath10  10@xmath52  cmmolecule@xmath14 @xcite , and are presented in table  [ tbl-3 ] . for the ysos in our sample the values obtained are commensurate with those previously reported for low - mass ysos @xcite ; the column densities for the lines of sight towards background sources are generally lower , as found in previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as explained in the introduction to this article , a key aim of these observations was to explore the links between h@xmath1o , co@xmath1 , and co ice column densities , and to test the chemistry relating these species .",

    "our results clearly follow the trends established by previous observations .",
    "both the h@xmath1o and co@xmath1 column densities increase with a@xmath29 , commensurate with the previously calculated critical a@xmath29 values of @xmath41  3 and @xmath41  4 , respectively , although such low extinctions were not probed in this subset of akari observations .",
    "for both h@xmath1o and co@xmath1 we would expect an increase in ice column density with a@xmath29 ; more dust equals , on average , more ice .",

    "figure  [ fig - av / h2o]b shows the column densities of co@xmath1 and co plotted against the column density of h@xmath1o .",
    "overall , the data calculated in this study agree well with literature values ; the relationships between h@xmath1o , co@xmath1 and co in molecular clouds and around ysos are well established and it is important that new data continue to reinforce previous results . as expected , there is no clear relation between the h@xmath1o and co column densities , as the freeze - out and formation mechanisms of each species differ vastly .",
    "however , a linear correlation between the h@xmath1o and co@xmath1 column densities is evident , indicating a potential link in the formation chemistry of these two species .",
    "it is possible that they both share a common chemical starting point ; one route to h@xmath1o formation involves h + oh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one route to co@xmath1 formation involves co + oh @xcite and could account for the co@xmath1 ice observed in quiescent regions @xcite .",
    "recent experimental results show that the relative rates of these two reactions , if occurring concurrently , and if they were the only reactions producing h@xmath1o and co@xmath1 , would generate around 20 times more h@xmath1o than co@xmath1 , assuming that all the reagents were equally available @xcite .",
    "obviously , these conditions may not be satisfied even in a quiescent line of sight .",
    "figure  [ fig - av / h2o]b shows that the h@xmath1o : co@xmath1 ratio is approximately 10:1 , suggesting that other mechanisms must produce the remainder of the observed co@xmath1 . unlike the subset of background stars and low luminosity ysos surveyed here , column density values for low and high mass ysos tend to be much higher ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; corroborating evidence that uv processing or longer timescales promote co@xmath1 formation via more complex co@xmath1 formation mechanisms .",
    "figure  [ fig - ternary ] is a ternary plot showing the relative column densities of all three species on a single plot .",
    "it includes fewer data points than figure  [ fig - av / h2o ] , simply because far fewer studies have been able to ascertain the abundances of all three species towards individual lines of sight .",
    "this figure clearly illustrates the range of background star data and column densities which were probed by this survey .",
    "looking more closely at the three major ice species , more can be learnt about their interlinking chemistries by considering the individual components of each . during this process , it is important to consider all available literature data in order to ascertain general correlations , rather than potentially drawing conclusions based on survey - specific trends .",
    "we first consider the relationship between h@xmath1o column density and the column densities of pure co ( co@xmath46 ) and co in a h@xmath1o - rich ice environment ( co@xmath47 ) in figure  [ fig - cocomponent_vsh2o ] .",
    "it is postulated from laboratory experiments that these two co ice environments promote very different ice chemistries : in the pure co ice the reactions are dominated by successive h atom , o atom and radical additions to the co molecule to form co@xmath1 , hcooh , h@xmath1co and ch@xmath5oh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in the water - rich co ice , photon- and electron - induced chemical processes become more important , firstly because the co molecule is trapped , leading to a co chemistry at temperatures above its desorption energy , and secondly because ( unlike the co molecule ) h@xmath1o can be photodissociated , allowing reaction with co to form co@xmath1 , hcooh , h@xmath1co and ch@xmath5oh as well as many more complex molecules ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is only through observational evidence that we can start to discriminate between these processes and refine gas - grain astrochemical models .",
    "it is clear from analysis of figure  [ fig - cocomponent_vsh2o ] that there is no correlation of h@xmath1o with pure co , which condenses out of the gas phase as a layer on top of the h@xmath1o .",
    "however , for the h@xmath1o - rich phase of the co , as expected , n(co@xmath47 ) increases with n(h@xmath1o ) . @xcite offer evidence for the porosity of h@xmath1o in the ism , as their experiments suggest that the population of co in a h@xmath1o - rich environment develops upon heating of a layered system .",
    "a higher column density of h@xmath1o ice suggests a larger number of pores for the co to migrate into with time or temperature to produce a mixed phase @xcite . as figure  [ fig - cocomponent_vsh2o ] shows , towards ysos",
    "there is generally a higher column density of co in a h@xmath1o - rich environment .",
    "the ice has been present in these regions for longer , so it is therefore more likely that the co has had the time ( or the temperature change ) necessary to migrate into a mixed h@xmath1o layer .",
    "otherwise , background stars would be expected to probe lines of sight with equally high column densities of co@xmath47 .",
    "it is important to note that co@xmath47 is a derived feature , as it can not be measured in isolation in the laboratory .",
    "figure  [ fig - co2component ] illustrates the relationship between the h@xmath1o column density and that of the two components of co@xmath1 ",
    "co@xmath1 in a co - rich ice ( co@xmath59 ) and co@xmath1 in a h@xmath1o - rich ice ( co@xmath60 ) .",
    "when the component column densities from the broader literature , primarily from low and intermediate mass objects , are included in the plot ( open symbols ) , two different correlation gradients are clearly evident , which both scale directly with ice abundance ( albeit at different rates ) suggesting that the dominant formation mechanisms for co@xmath1 in water - rich and water - poor environments are independent of one another .",
    "@xcite generated similar gradient profiles by comparing the total elemental o atom distribution , derived by summing the co , co@xmath1 , and h@xmath1o ice column densities , in the h@xmath1o - rich ( _ polar _ ) and co - rich ( _ apolar _ ) ice phases on extincted lines of sight towards a sample of around ten bright background stars and ysos . they show that the elemental o is uniformly distributed between the water - rich and water - poor ice components , and is well correlated with the dust density , suggesting that the final fraction of o atoms accumulating in interstellar ices is a constant reservoir from cloud to cloud , but that the absolute source to source o atom distribution between the three major ice molecules ",
    "co , h@xmath1o , and co@xmath1  can vary significantly .",
    "they attribute most of this variance to the co@xmath1 population in the water - rich ice component , suggesting that the co@xmath1 ice column densities are invariant with the efficiency of surface chemical pathways , instead reflecting variations in gas phase chemistry ( related to co gas densities ) or photodesorption of the co ice .",
    "our data do not entirely corroborate this conclusion .",
    "the component column densities of co@xmath1 in a co - rich ice ( co@xmath59 ) , derived from our two - component fitting , match very well with previously reported values ( as is the case for the co ice components in figure  [ fig - cocomponent_vsh2o ] ) , providing reassurance in our analysis methods , despite the fitting limitations imposed by the akari resolution discussed in   [ sec - co2 ] .",
    "it is therefore interesting to note that we have sampled a very specific population of co@xmath1 in a h@xmath1o - rich ice ( co@xmath60 ) , which clearly occupy the lower left - hand region of figure  [ fig - co2component ] , commensurate with a handful of previous data points .",
    "it seems therefore that the formation of co@xmath1 in h@xmath1o - rich ices is actually bimodal .",
    "the most likely scenario is that co@xmath1 ices first form via atom and radical surface reactions of co in competition with h@xmath1o formation , producing a limited concentration of co@xmath1 in a h@xmath1o - rich ice ( co@xmath60 ) .",
    "later , a combination of co freeze - out and co migration to the water - rich ice layer , followed by energetic processing of the ices , leads to a second phase of co@xmath1 formation , which then dominates the co@xmath1 in a h@xmath1o - rich ice ( co@xmath60 ) column density .",
    "this is entirely in agreement with the `` early '' and `` late '' formation mechanism model proposed by @xcite , and implies that the co@xmath1:h@xmath1o ratio will vary significantly from source to source ( as indicated by @xcite ) , but that this ratio will initially be dependent on competing surface reaction rates between co , h , and oh to form co@xmath1 and h@xmath1o , then subsequently on the degree to which ice mantles are thermally or energetically processed , rather than the prevailing gas phase conditions . @xcite have very recently illustrated that crystalline co@xmath1-rich ice layers can dominate grain mantles under the unusual circumstances where significant thermal processing occurs in the vicinity of a protostar ( in this case hops-68 ) , on the one hand , therefore , figure  [ fig - co2component ] corroborates the @xcite hypothesis : the component of co@xmath1 ice in the h@xmath1o - rich layer dominates the correlations between the major interstellar ice components .",
    "however , whilst our overall co@xmath1 column densities match well with existing literature values , the fraction of co@xmath1 ice we observe in water - rich environments is relatively small .",
    "previous studies have illustrated that there is not a direct link between co freeze - out and all co@xmath1 formation , as there is no overall correlation in the abundances of total co and total co@xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure  [ fig - covsco2 ]",
    ", the plot of the pure component of co against the co - rich component of co@xmath1 shows no correlation , suggesting that the formation route to co@xmath1 formed in the co layer is not a simple one , and probably not driven only by co reacting with o , h , or oh from the gas phase ; a similar conclusion was reached from our analysis of figure  [ fig - av / h2o]b .",
    "it is likely that the relative co and co@xmath1 populations in the co - rich ice environments are additionally regulated by competing photo - desorption processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig - cocomponent_vsco2 ] shows plots of the column density of the water - rich co@xmath1 component versus the column density of the co components co@xmath46 and co@xmath47 .",
    "it is very clear from these plots that there is a strong link between the column densities of co@xmath1 and co in a h@xmath1o - rich environment ( co@xmath47 ) .",
    "thus , some co@xmath1 must form from co in a h@xmath1o environment . mirroring the relationship established between h@xmath1o and co@xmath1 in a h@xmath1o - rich environment ( figure  [ fig - co2component ] ) ,",
    "background stars probing quiescent lines of sight have the lowest column densities of co in a h@xmath1o - rich environment , while in the more evolved ysos , there is a higher column density , suggesting that co@xmath1 forms from co which has migrated into the h@xmath1o upon formation of a star in the core .",
    "this is key evidence supporting the conclusions of the ice mapping in @xcite .",
    "these data illustrate the links between all of the components present in the co and co@xmath1 absorption features , and the sequence of co@xmath1 formation in molecular clouds and star - forming cores .",
    "the proposed sequence is outlined here : initially , co@xmath1 forms concurrently with h@xmath1o , producing an abundance of co@xmath1 in h@xmath1o .",
    "upon critical freeze - out of co , further co@xmath1 is formed by reactions of co with o , h , and oh , producing a co@xmath1 component in a co - rich ice . with time and , potentially , processing",
    ", some co migrates into the h@xmath1o ice , where it can react to form large column densities of co@xmath1 in a h@xmath1o - rich ice , likely by an energetic route enhanced by uv radiation from a newly formed yso .",
    "in this paper , the 2.5    5  @xmath0 m spectra of 22 background stars and eight ysos have been analysed to determine the column densities of key solid phase molecular species towards those lines of sight . prior to this study",
    ", only one complete spectrum of a background star had been obtained in this wavelength region , a region containing absorption bands for the three most abundant molecules present in interstellar ice .",
    "thus , the addition of 22 spectra towards background stars to the literature provides valuable data to the community , which could help to benchmark the initial conditions in star - forming regions before the onset of star formation .",
    "the analysis of this large sample of data by a rigorous fitting approach reinforces the argument that the methods employed here are possible for large datasets ( as previously shown by e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is not necessary to employ a `` mix and match '' approach using multiple laboratory spectra in order to define the ice characteristics of a wide range of objects .      *",
    "the sensitivity of akari enabled us to probe lines of sight towards objects with fluxes @xmath3  5  mjy , allowing observation of spectra in a previously inaccessible parameter space . *",
    "co@xmath1 and h@xmath1o were found to be ubiquitous where ice was observed , at column densities commensurate with previously reported literature values .",
    "* from the profile of the h@xmath1o ice band , the extended red wing seems to be an evolutionary indicator of both dust properties and the extent to which the ice mantle covers the grain .",
    "* new observations of the co@xmath1 stretching absorption band profiles , and ice column densities for lines of sight towards 21 background stars , have been obtained .",
    "* co ice absorption features were extracted from the spectra of 23 of the 30 lines of sight probed . in at least two objects  objects 4 and 20 ",
    "the co ice absorption band profile is fully described by a single pure co component only . * on 15 lines of sight towards background stars ,",
    "the column densities of all three species h@xmath1o , co@xmath1 , and co were extracted .",
    "* by considering the column densities of co and co@xmath1 in different ice components , it is possible to postulate a co@xmath1 formation scenario involving two or three distinct stages .",
    "the proposed timeline is : early formation concurrent with h@xmath1o ; late formation by energetic routes when co has frozen out and migrated into an h@xmath1o environment ; and the formation of co@xmath1 in the co layer at an uncertain time , and by uncertain mechanisms .    as our knowledge of interstellar solid state ices increases",
    ", many common factors are continuing to emerge in our understanding of their formation and evolution . by surveying ices features in the spectra of faint ysos and background sources ,",
    "we have sampled a further region of parameter space in which ices can be detected .",
    "clearly , even where correlations are evident between one ice species and another , the range of molecular column densities remains vast .",
    "the local environment must , therefore , have a significant effect on ice column density , composition and growth .",
    "even the individual components of a species potentially vary across a cloud . in order to use solid phase molecular species as probes of ice and gas chemistry",
    ", it will be necessary to map their distributions on a 2d spatial scale , as well as making many more observations of both solid phase species and gas phase molecules .",
