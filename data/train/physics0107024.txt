    "the generation of harmonics by atoms and molecules in a laser field is a topic that has been thoroughly studied during the last fifteen years ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the big interest lies in the potential of atoms and molecules in laser fields as sources of short - wavelength and short pulse radiation .",
    "it is well known that when a strong linearly polarized laser field interacts with an atom only odd harmonics are generated . in more complex systems a detailed study of the symmetry transformations is required for predicting which harmonics are allowed or not @xcite . in a recent work",
    "@xcite it was shown that peculiar selection rules can be obtained for molecules which are invariant under a discrete rotational symmetry @xmath4 ( like benzene where @xmath1 ) .",
    "when this kind of molecules interacts with a circularly polarized laser pulse of infinite duration , the selection rules for the harmonics are @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the harmonic order .",
    "this class of molecules is particularly interesting because they can work as a filter , i.e. , the first allowed harmonic is @xmath8 , and therefore , if @xmath0 is large , the emitted frequency can be very high .",
    "all systems whose hamiltonian is invariant under a `` dynamical rotation '' , i.e. , a discrete spatial rotation plus a time translation , generate selection rules of the kind @xmath2 .",
    "together with cyclic molecules another example of such a system is the single atom interacting with two - color laser fields with circular polarizations and frequencies one an integer multiple of the other . in both the molecular and the atomic case it is possible to obtain these selection rules also from the conservation of the angular momentum component perpendicular to the polarization plane .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have presented results from numerical simulations for a benzene model - molecule showing that , when a realistic , finite pulse is taken into account , other lines than those expected from the @xmath9 selection rule can be present . in this paper",
    "we will show that , if embedded in a general group theory treatment , also this case can be understood in a systematic way .",
    "our analysis will allow us to achieve a full understanding of the molecule harmonic spectrum .",
    "moreover , we will show that the field - dressed level scheme can be inferred from the harmonic spectrum .",
    "the particular features and differences of a finite pulse compared to an infinite one will be also addressed .",
    "all the laser fields considered are circularly polarized in the @xmath10-plane , and atomic units are used throughout the paper .",
    "we apply the dipole approximation which is excellent for the laser frequencies and intensities under consideration .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath11 of a cyclic molecule interacting with a single laser field and the hamiltonian @xmath12 of a single atom interacting with two circularly polarized lasers are , from a symmetry point of view , equivalent . both are invariant under certain dynamical rotations .",
    "we will consider only a single electron active .",
    "this assumption does not introduce any loss of generality to our derivations @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath11 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath13 reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the amplitude of the electric field .",
    "if @xmath16 is a model potential for a cyclic molecule with @xmath0 ions the hamiltonian @xmath11 is invariant under the transformation @xcite",
    "@xmath17    in the case of the single atom in the two - color field @xmath12 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the electric field amplitudes of the two laser fields and opposite polarization has been assumed .",
    "the second laser has a frequency that is @xmath21 times the frequency of the first laser , with @xmath21 integer .",
    "it is nice to see that it is really the second laser which generates the particular symmetry .",
    "in fact , all the terms except the last one of @xmath12 , are invariant under the continuous transformation @xmath22 where @xmath23 has , so far , an arbitrary value .",
    "if no other term is present in @xmath12 no harmonics are generated .",
    "forcing also the last term to be invariant under such a transformation leads to @xmath24 therefore the hamiltonian @xmath12 is invariant under the discrete transformation @xmath25 and this is equivalent to the case of a cyclic molecule with @xmath26 .",
    "hence the selection rules for this case are equal to those derived in @xcite for the cyclic molecules , @xmath5 .",
    "the case where the two lasers have the same polarization can be handled with the same method , leading to similar selection rules .",
    "further details will be discussed elsewhere @xcite . in the following the two lasers",
    "are always considered with opposite polarization .",
    "an experiment with the two frequencies @xmath27 and @xmath28 was performed @xcite , and its theoretical aspects were recently discussed within a semiclassical three - step model @xcite .",
    "selection rules for the case of an atom interacting with a circularly polarized field of frequency @xmath27 and a linearly polarized field of frequency @xmath29 were also derived @xcite , confirming numerical results obtained previously @xcite .    in the derivation of the @xmath9-selection",
    "rule one assumes that only a single non degenerate , bound state is involved in the harmonic generation process . with this restriction the selection rules",
    "can be also derived simply with a change of reference frame . in the rotating laser field",
    "frame the observer `` sees '' an ionic potential oscillating with a frequency @xmath29 in a static field ; in the two - color atomic case instead , after the change of frame , the atom is at rest in the static field and it experiences an oscillating field of frequency @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "hence , in this frame the dipole has only fourier components of frequency @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "going back to the laboratory frame where the molecule is at rest , the fourier components are shifted @xmath34 and the selection rules presented in @xcite are obtained . keeping the assumption of a single bound state involved in the process , it is , moreover , possible to derive the same selection rules also arguing about the angular momentum only .",
    "let us first discuss about the cyclic molecule : because of the symmetry of the molecule , an expansion of the ground state in spherical harmonics @xmath35 has to look like @xmath36 , i.e , the ground state is expanded over functions that have the required azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the wavefunction is then invariant under a rotation of @xmath37 .",
    "let us assume that the laser field has a polarization @xmath38 , i.e. , the projection of the angular momentum of a photon on the field propagation direction is equal to 1 .",
    "if a harmonic of polarization @xmath38 is emitted , the molecule , for keeping the symmetry , hence has to absorb @xmath39 photons so that the final change in the projection of the angular momentum is @xmath40 . on the contrary , if the harmonic emitted has polarization @xmath41 , the molecule must absorb @xmath42 photons .",
    "the consequence is that for each @xmath43 the higher harmonic @xmath39 has the same polarization as the laser field , and the lower @xmath42 the opposite one , as it was obtained with the dynamical symmetry method in @xcite . for the atom",
    "the derivation is similar @xcite .",
    "let us assume an electron is in an @xmath44 state ( the quantum numbers @xmath45 and @xmath46 are zero ) .",
    "let the first laser of frequency @xmath27 have a polarization @xmath38 and the second laser of frequency @xmath47 a polarization @xmath41 .",
    "if a harmonic @xmath38 is emitted the sum of all the components along @xmath48 of the angular momentum carried by absorbed photons has to be @xmath49 .",
    "if from the first laser the atom absorbs @xmath50 photons , it must absorb @xmath51 from the second laser .",
    "the total absorbed energy is @xmath52 = \\omega [ ( p-1)(1+\\eta ) + 1]$ ] . since @xmath50 is arbitrary , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 we see that the @xmath55 harmonic is emitted . with the same argument ,",
    "starting from a harmonic of polarization @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath42 .",
    "from a group theory point of view the hamiltonian @xmath56 of a cyclic molecule without the laser field has a symmetry described by the group @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "when the molecule interacts with a laser field which has no temporal envelope its total hamiltonian , given by ( [ ham_mo ] ) , can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the molecule - laser interaction .",
    "first we study the symmetry group of the total hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath56 has the symmetry @xmath57 and @xmath60 is described by @xmath61 , i.e , an extension to infinity of the so called `` cyclic dynamical symmetry group '' @xcite , defined by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the order of the group and the number of its elements .",
    "@xmath64 is the operator already introduced in ( [ rotat ] ) which acts in space and time , and is defined as @xmath65 combining @xmath57 and @xmath61 we have that the symmetry group of the hamiltonian @xmath11 is @xmath66 where @xmath0 is the number of ions in the molecule which determines the discrete rotational symmetry .    because @xmath67 is a cyclic group , it is also abelian , and therefore it has the following properties : ( _ i _ ) each element forms a class by its own and hence there are @xmath0 irreducible representations , ( _ ii _ ) each irreducible representation is one - dimensional , i.e. , the elements are complex numbers .",
    "the group @xmath67 is isomorphic to the well known group @xmath4 and therefore the same character table apply .",
    "it is interesting to look how , from a physical point of view , the symmetry of the molecular hamiltonian changes when the laser field is present .",
    "the group @xmath57 contains @xmath68 elements , i.e. , @xmath0 rotations about an axis of the @xmath0th order , @xmath0 rotations through an angle @xmath69 about horizontal axes , @xmath0 reflections @xmath70 at the vertical planes and @xmath0 rotary - reflection transformations @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "looking at the field - dressed hamiltonian ( [ ham_mo ] ) it appears that only the rotations about the vertical axis are still symmetry transformations .",
    "in fact , the reflection at the vertical planes and the rotations about horizontal axes would require a space - dependent time transformation .",
    "the reflection @xmath72 at the horizontal plane would change the polarization of the laser field .",
    "hence from the @xmath68 possible operations we had for @xmath56 only @xmath0 , i.e. , the rotations about the vertical axis , keep the hamiltonian @xmath11 invariant .    for a certain group @xmath4",
    "the type of its irreducible representations depends on @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 is odd there are one real and @xmath73 complex representations , if @xmath0 is even there are two real and @xmath74 complex representations .",
    "half of the complex representations is the complex conjugate of the other half .",
    "usually in the literature , the two complex conjugated representations are considered equivalent and indicated with e , normally reserved for two - dimensional representations @xcite . in our case , because the hamiltonian ( [ ham_mo ] ) is not time - reversal invariant , these representations are not equivalent .",
    "therefore we have to keep all the @xmath0 representations separated .",
    "we call each of the @xmath0 irreducible representations @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an index between @xmath77 and @xmath73",
    ". the generator of the @xmath76-th representation is given by @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , it follows that the @xmath79-th entry of the @xmath76-th representation is @xmath80 ( the first entry is given by the identity ) . because of the unidimensionality of the representations the product of two representations , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , is the irreducible representation @xmath83 . if @xmath84 , @xmath83 is equivalent to @xmath85 .",
    "thus each entry of the product table is again a representation @xmath75 with @xmath86 .",
    "three conclusions can be drawn now : ( i ) from the definition of the representation generator we have that the complex conjugated representation of @xmath75 is @xmath87 , ( ii ) the representation @xmath88 has all characters equal to 1 ( this is the well known `` totally symmetric irreducible representation '' ) and it is present for every @xmath0 , ( iii ) when @xmath0 is even @xmath89 is the other real representation .",
    "the description given so far in terms of group theory will prove particularly useful later on when we analyze the transitions between the field - dressed states of the molecule .",
    "indeed , whether an electronic transition between two states , each of them corresponding to an irreducible representation , is allowed or not can be determined examining the product of the symmetries of the initial state , the inducing operator , and the complex conjugated of the final state .",
    "if the product leads to the totally symmetric irreducible representation the transition is possible , i.e. , @xmath90 in our notation .",
    "provided the laser pulse is sufficiently adiabatic and the emitting molecules can be considered uncorrelated it is a good approximation to calculate the harmonic spectrum from the fourier - transformed dipole expectation value . with the wavefunction",
    "@xmath91 we can write the probability to get the @xmath7th harmonic as @xmath92 for a system whose hamiltonian is periodic in time with a period @xmath93 we can apply the floquet theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the wavefunction of a certain state of the system can be written as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the so - called quasi - energy and @xmath96 .",
    "the functions @xmath97 are eigenfunction of @xmath98 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath99 in what follows we refer to @xmath97 as a floquet state .",
    "if the system is in a pure floquet state we can derive the selection rules as presented in @xcite .",
    "however , due to pulse shape effects or other perturbations the system might be not in a pure floquet state , but rather in a superposition of them , @xmath100 here , for simplicity , we assume the @xmath101s constant ( or slowly varying ) in time .",
    "the quasi - energies are given by @xmath102 where the real part @xmath103 is the field - dressed energy of the state and the imaginary part @xmath104 corresponds to half the ionization rate .",
    "the latter would lead to finite harmonic line widths of lorentzian shape . in what follows",
    "we will neglect this effect keeping only the real part of @xmath95 for our symmetry analysis .",
    "( [ proba ] ) then becomes @xmath105 we introduce @xmath106 and the following operator @xmath107 noting that the functions @xmath97 form an extended hilbert space @xcite eq .",
    "( [ expan ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath108 where the double brackets stand for integration over time and space .",
    "we can think about the different operators @xmath109 as operators which induce transitions where the initial and the final states can be the same or different .",
    "such transitions are accompanied by the emission of harmonics .",
    "if the system is stable in one floquet state the expansion in ( [ expan2 ] ) reduces to only one term . in particular , when we consider the system being in the floquet ground state @xmath110 , @xmath111 is proportional to the fourier - transform of the expectation value of the dipole calculated with the floquet ground state , i.e. , @xmath112 from ( [ expan2 ] ) , the structure of the dipole spectrum can be derived .",
    "because @xmath113 , @xmath114 and writing the operator @xmath115 explictly we have @xmath116 \\\\ & = & \\hat{g}_\\mp^{(i , j ) } \\left [ \\rme^{\\rmi   \\frac{2\\pi } { n}(n -\\frac{\\delta_i^j}{\\omega } \\mp 1 ) } \\right ] .",

    "also @xmath126 generates a phase . for allowing the emission of a harmonic the product of these three phases",
    "must be the real unity .",
    "consequently , the operator @xmath119 has to belong to the representation @xmath127 . imposing the term in square brackets of eq .",
    "( [ gener ] ) to be equal to the generator of the representation @xmath128 leads to @xmath129 from this follows @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "introducing the extended index @xmath132 , i.e. , the symmetry index minus the field - dressed energy of the state in frequency units , we can rewrite ( [ rules ] ) in the final form@xmath133 where @xmath134 .",
    "varying @xmath7 we force the generic operators @xmath109 to behave under the dynamical rotations according to the different representations @xmath75 of the symmetry group , and for each @xmath135 certain harmonics are emitted . for the special case @xmath136 one obtains @xmath5 , reproducing the results in @xcite .",
    "they have been calculated taking @xmath137 and @xmath138 because the initial and the final state are the same .",
    "@xmath136 behaves according to the totally symmetric representation @xmath88 .",
    "it is worth to be noted that if the energy difference of the field - dressed states corresponding to the irreducible representations @xmath139 and @xmath140 is equal to @xmath141 we have a kind of accidental degeneracy : the lines corresponding to such transition can not be distinguished from those arising from the single state processes .",
    "the operators @xmath109 can behave according to any representation .",
    "hence all couplings between the floquet states of the molecule are in principle possible .",
    "this of course does not mean that they have equal probability to occur .",
    "considering that the ground state corresponds to @xmath88 , and the other @xmath75 represent excited states we can derive the following symmetry properties for the relevant single transitions : ( _ i _ ) @xmath142 : symmetry @xmath88 , ( _ ii _ ) @xmath143 : symmetry @xmath75 , ( _ iii _ ) @xmath144 : symmetry @xmath145 , ( _ iv _ ) @xmath146 : symmetry @xmath147 .",
    "it is evident that when the frequency @xmath27 ( or one of its integer multiples ) of a finite laser pulse is nearly resonant with a transition to a certain state , this state becomes more easily accessible , and therefore transitions involving that state are more likely to happen . on the other hand ,",
    "when the laser frequency is tuned off from all the resonances mostly the field - dressed ground state , i.e. @xmath88 , is involved and it will be the only one giving a significant contribution to harmonic generation .    the fact that selection rules for different initial and final states contain the terms @xmath103 is particularly interesting for the case where the rotating field removes a degeneracy .",
    "the measurement of the distance between the satellite lines arising from the two states gives an estimation of the field - dressed level - splitting .",
    "the benzene molecule has a symmetry @xmath148 , but as long as we consider only functions which are all even or odd with respect to reflection at the molecule plane ( @xmath72 in the standard notation ) it is sufficient to consider only the symmetry operations of the reduced group @xmath149 .",
    "the character table of the group @xmath150 is given in tab .",
    "1 .    connecting the four lowest states of the benzene molecule and the irreducible representations of the group @xmath150 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 leads to the following energetic sequence : @xmath151 ( ground state ) , @xmath154 ( first excited , two - dimensional , i.e. , two - fold degenerated ) , @xmath153 ( second excited , two - fold degenerated ) , @xmath152 ( third excited , non - degenerated ) @xcite . in the ground state @xmath151 and",
    "@xmath154 contain two and four @xmath69-electrons , respectively , and the other levels are empty @xcite .",
    "as it was discussed in the previous section , when the circularly polarized laser field has an infinite duration , the total hamiltonian @xmath155 would belong to the dynamical symmetry group @xmath156 which is isomorphic to @xmath157 .",
    "the character table of the groups @xmath157 and @xmath156 is shown in tab 2 .",
    "for the group @xmath157 the standard notation is reported , for the group @xmath156 instead we use the notation that has been previously introduced . with the laser field",
    "switched on the degeneracies connected to the representations @xmath154 and @xmath153 are removed . if we take for example the degenerated level @xmath158 of the field - free system , in an infinite pulse it is reducible , and knowing the irreducible representations of the group @xmath157 we can easily decompose it into irreducible parts : @xmath159 . the same argument can be applied to the level @xmath160 , @xmath161 .",
    "what is worth to be stressed is that , contrary to the standard case in quantum mechanics textbooks , here the two representations which are complex conjugated , like @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , @xmath165 , correspond to two different energy levels and therefore the so - called \" physically irreducible  representations really generate two independent states .",
    "this particular feature is due to the non - invariance of the total hamiltonian @xmath166 under a time inversion .",
    "a similar case is obtained when a magnetic field is considered .    at this point , with an oscillating field infinite in time , we can think about the field - dressed molecule states in pure terms of @xmath167 , where @xmath168 runs from @xmath77 to @xmath169 .",
    "this system is stable , i.e. , there are no transitions between the states corresponding to different representations , unless external perturbations are present . the selection rules in this case can be derived from the product table , tab .",
    "3 . when the pulse has a finite length we can consider the pulse shape as a perturbation of a system that has a @xmath150 symmetry .",
    "a transition between two states is possible only if the operator inducing the transition has the `` proper '' symmetry . as it can be derived from tab .",
    "1 the representations @xmath151 , @xmath154 , @xmath153 and @xmath152 correspond to rotations of angle @xmath77 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath69 , respectively . in terms of @xmath76",
    "they correspond to @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "in this section we illustrate and test our group theoretical method by applying it to harmonic spectra obtained with the help of _ ab initio _ numerical simulations . in order to keep the numerical effort feasible",
    "we restrict ourselves to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) model where the molecule plane and the rotating electric field are properly represented .",
    "we study a single active electron in a ring - shaped potential with @xmath4 symmetry ( @xmath176 in the benzene case ) .",
    "results from a fully 3d calculation could be quantitatively different but the structure of the spectrum would be the same .",

    "@xmath182 is the parameter which gives the `` degree of smoothness '' of the potential and determines the width of the ground state along the ring .",
    "@xmath183 moves the local maxima of the potential keeping the minima constant ( the parameter @xmath183 is introduced in order to avoid the presence of points where @xmath184 for finite @xmath180 , because that could generate non - physical ionization ) .",
    "finally , @xmath185 is the `` strength '' of the potential . for our simulations we chose @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "we used @xmath185 for tuning the ionization energy of the molecule . for more details about the model and its properties",
    "see @xcite .",
    "when the correct ionization energy for the benzene molecule is taken , the four states are relatively weakly bound and hence , as it has been already discussed in @xcite , for inducing a multiphoton process with a low ionization rate a low frequency is required . as the main aim of the numerical simulations presented in this work is to test _ ab initio _ the analytical derivations discussed in the previous sections , we chose @xmath188 which is less demanding for what concerns the run - time because a higher frequency can be used @xcite .    if with @xmath189 we indicate the field - free energy of the level corresponding to the @xmath190 representation of the @xmath150 group , with @xmath188 the energies of the four states are : @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 , and the energy gaps between the excited states and the ground state are @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 . in order to have a convenient way of referencing we introduce the notation @xmath198 for indicating a transition between the state @xmath199 and @xmath200 and its corresponding line in the spectrum .",
    "@xmath201 is the @xmath76 which gives the transition symmetry .",
    "the lower index distinguishes between the two signs in equation ( [ rules ] ) .",
    "the upper indices specify the initial and the final state , respectively .",
    "the order of the states in the upper index gives information about the sign of the line shift due to the distance between the states .",
    "most of the non - single - state transitions discussed here connect an excited state with the ground state .",
    "transitions between excited states are possible but much less likely to occur .",
    "the position of the lines due to a `` transition '' from the ground to an excited state is @xmath202 , and for the opposite process @xmath203 , where @xmath103 is the distance between the ground state and the state @xmath199 .",
    "when the laser is switched on the states move because of the dynamical stark effect and therefore @xmath103 is given by @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the separation between the two states when no field is present and @xmath206 is the relative shift due to the presence of the oscillating field .    at this point",
    ", as we know the selection rules and the values of the field - free energy intervals @xmath205 , we can predict the structure of a spectrum where also non - single state processes are involved .",
    "the only uncertainty is due to the values of the field shifts @xmath206 .",
    "however , those shifts can be determined by performing several simulations with different laser intensities : when the field is low @xmath206 is small ( in the limit of zero field @xmath207 ) and the lines are located in the proximity of the position expected from the unperturbed level scheme . with increasing field the shift of the states can be followed .",
    "those shifts can become relatively large but the interpretation of the spectrum remains always unambiguous .",
    "an example of a spectrum , where also lines occurring from processes between different states are present , is shown in fig .  1 . there , a sine - square pulse of 40 cycles and frequency @xmath208 interacting with the model molecule has been simulated",
    "the peak field strength @xmath209 was 0.14 .",
    "it is possible to figure out for each peak the transition which generates it .",
    "the same symbol indicates the same process but with different multiplier @xmath43 , i.e. , different number of photons .",
    "a certain process is repeated every @xmath176 frequency units .",
    "the states that together with the ground state play a role are the first and the second excited , i.e. , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 .",
    "the first state generates transitions of type @xmath212 , the second state of type @xmath213 . with the parameters used for the simulation of fig .",
    "1 the role of the second state is more important than that one of the first excited state .",
    "this is mainly related to how strong the resonance with a particular state is . with a different frequency",
    "the relative intensity of the lines connected to the two processes can differ strongly . from the fact that the degeneracies of the states @xmath210 and @xmath211",
    "are removed one could expect more lines than present in fig .  1 .",
    "let us discuss for example about the states @xmath211 , that in our case are the most important role players .",
    "each of the states @xmath211 for a given @xmath43 generates two lines given by @xmath214 and two given by @xmath215 .",
    "therefore eight lines are expected . however , using @xmath216 and @xmath217 to distinguish the two states @xmath153 , we find the shifts @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "considering that @xmath220 it follows that if the difference of the shifts @xmath206 due to the laser field is very small the eight lines are gathered in four couples , each of them containing two very close lines , difficult to resolve .",
    "moreover , what makes the distinction between the two lines in a couple possible is not the absolute value of @xmath206 but the difference between the two shifts . as the two states without field are degenerate , this difference is the splitting generated by the field . with our notation",
    "we have for the first couple of lines , e.g. , @xmath221 .",
    "the same applies for the other three couples .",
    "this explains why in fig .",
    "1 only four lines due to the states @xmath153 are observed .    in order to obtain a larger splitting ,",
    "more easily detectable , we have to study how the shift @xmath206 behaves with respect to the different field parameters .",
    "it was found that with lower frequencies the separation among the states which without field would be degenerate becomes more significant , as one would expect from a ponderomotive scaling .",
    "moreover , it has been observed that the value of each @xmath206 can become relatively large compared to @xmath205 . in fig .",
    "2 we show how the location of certain lines moves when the field is increased .",
    "the dipole spectrum obtained with the lower frequency @xmath222 ( all other parameters the same as before ) is shown in fig .",
    "3 . each of the lines in fig .",
    "1 is splitted in two , confirming our predictions .    in order to investigate the role of pulse shape effects simulations using trapezoidal pulses with different rampings",
    "have been performed . in fig .",
    "4 two spectra for pulses of the same length but with a @xmath223 cycle and @xmath224 cycle ramping , respectively , are reported .",
    "it appears that in both case the overall structure is like in the case of the sine - square pulse .",
    "it is worth to note that when the ramping is shorter , fig .",
    "4b , the relevance of the `` extra '' lines with respect to the @xmath225-lines originating from the single state transitions is higher than in the case of longer ramping , fig 4a .",
    "this is due to the fact that when the ramping is shorter the pulse is less adiabatic and therefore transitions between different floquet states are induced more likely . in the limit of an infinitely long ramping only the lines @xmath226 would be present .",
    "we presented a general group theoretical approach to harmonic generation by systems possessing a discrete rotational symmetry @xmath227 , in particular a ring - shaped molecule in a circularly polarized laser field ( e.g. , benzene ) . in the simple case where",
    "the initial and the final field - dressed electronic states are the same the known selection rule @xmath9 , @xmath3 was obtained .",
    "we demonstrated that this selection rule follows also from a change of reference frame as well as angular momentum conservation in a straight forward manner .",
    "since due to this selection rule less harmonics are allowed within a fixed frequency range such systems might be beneficial for generating short wavelength radiation more efficiently , i.e. , without wasting a vast amount of laser energy in undesired laser harmonics .",
    "however , we showed that in general other harmonics different from the expected ones at the positions @xmath228 are present as well .",
    "those lines carry important information about the laser field - dressed level scheme of the molecule since energy differences between different states are involved .",
    "transitions between field - dressed states occur because the laser pulse has a temporal shape instead of being infinite as assumed in the derivation of the @xmath9-selection rule . for the case of the ring - shaped molecule we showed that our group theoretical method is capable to predict also the position of those extra lines .",
    "this was demonstrated with the help of harmonic spectra obtained by an _ ab initio _ numerical simulation of a benzene model molecule interacting with a finite laser pulse .",
    "the extra harmonics are particularly pronounced in the cases where the laser frequency ( or a multiple of it ) becomes resonant with electronic transitions between field - dressed states .",
    "harmonic peak splittings and shifts were fully understood in the framework of the group theory approach . from the symmetry point of view",
    "the case of a cyclic molecule in a circularly polarized laser field is equivalent to a single atom in a two - color field with one frequency an integer multiple of the other .",
    "of course , the groups representing the unperturbed systems are different .",
