    "<S> we agree with the author that his possible global md minimum is better than our estimate for the particular case @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not enough to conclude that the cm can not help to reduce substantially the computational effort in md or simulated annealing ( sa ) calculations for the following reasons .    1 .   from the monte carlo and md calculations , even for a relatively small number of charged particles </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that the amount of stable configurations grows very rapidly with the number of particles . </S>",
    "<S> sometimes , metastable states with lower ( or higher ) symmetry are found with much higher probability than the true ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this fact was confirmed by the author who _ `` generated 3001 configurations ... '' _ to get just one instance of the improved @xmath3 new tentative ground state , with our prediction for the particle number at the boundary ring : _ </S>",
    "<S> `` ... np = 147 charges are disposed on the border of the disk , in agreement with ref.1''_. evidently , in contrast to his claim , amore has confirmed the usefulness of the cm . </S>",
    "<S> + indeed , the particle number on the boundary ring @xmath4 is one of the key elements for any calculation , since once it is defined , it is necessary to simulate less various configurations ( with a number of charges @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a number of rings , and @xmath8 is a total number of charges . </S>",
    "<S> + in fact , external ring occupations are extremely well predicted with some occasional @xmath9 mismatch by means of the expression @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 $ ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that these expressions are obtained from the systematic cm results . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   in our publication @xcite , in order to obtain our estimate of the md ground state @xmath12 , we generated only 100 configurations with the boundary ring @xmath13 charges , where the internal charges were randomly distributed . </S>",
    "<S> as a result , we have obtained @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the disagreement between the author s new result and our model prediction @xmath15 is still less than @xmath16 ( as we stated in our paper it is @xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the occupations for the external ( approximately circular ) shells are quite accurately predicted within cm for any @xmath8 . in the case of @xmath1 we have obtained @xmath18 , while the analysis of the amore s md ground state yields @xmath19 . this comparison suggests that the effectivity of the cm prediction might be improved if the second ring , the nearest neigbor to the boundary one , should be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   to prove the usefulness of this idea we consider initial configurations characterized by external occupations : @xmath20 ( set 1 ) ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( set 2 ) ; @xmath20 , @xmath22 ( set 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in all cases we have generated 2000 configurations , where @xmath23 particles were initially set on the boundary at @xmath24 , and for two other sets @xmath25 particles have been distributed at @xmath26 . that value was chosen to take into account monopole oscillations around the equilibrium configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining particles were distributed randomly . </S>",
    "<S> + for the set 1 ( fig.[fig1 ] , top panel ) we found the lowest state @xmath27 , that occurs just once . in the middle panel ( set 2 ) </S>",
    "<S> we use two boundary shells @xmath20 , @xmath21 , predicted by the cm partition , and obtain slightly lower state . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ground state is not reached yet . </S>",
    "<S> + the systematic analysis of the cm results leads us to conclusion that the second shell occupation is fitted by the formula @xmath28 $ ] that yields @xmath22 . considering the initial configuration with @xmath20 , @xmath22 ( set 3 ) with randomly distributed internal charges ( fig.[fig1 ] , bottom panel ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain that the ground state @xmath29 occurs three times @xmath30 ) . in other words , with this initialization it appears once every 666 generated configurations . </S>",

    "<S> we recall that for infinite systems the hexagonal lattice has the lowest energy of all two - dimensional wigner bravais crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the decrease of system size places primary emphasis upon system boundaries ( see , for example , discussion in refs.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one needs to understand how the wigner crystallization may settle down , in a particular , in a disk geometry as a function of the number of interacting charged particles . in supplemental material </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results corresponding to the md and the semi - analytical approach for @xmath31 charges . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate a remarkable agreement between two approaches and make it clear how the centered hexagonal lattice ( chl ) evolves with the increase of charge particle number . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we strongly believe that the results obtained by means of our method can be successfully used to feed sa or md calculations with sensible initial configurations , reducing significantly the amount of scanning , normally needed to visit the global energy minima . </S>",
    "<S> 5 .   the systematic manifestation of the chl with the increase of particle number @xmath32 in our cm and md results can be interpreted as the onset of the hexagonal crystallization in the disk geometry . </S>",
    "<S> there is no , however , any manifestation of a phase transition , typical for infinite systems . in a finite system </S>",
    "<S> a crossover takes place from the chl to ring localization with the approaching to the disk boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this ring organization is clearly seen at the boundary in fig.2 presented by the author ( two clear rings ) .    in our paper we have compared the md configuration with the prediction of the cm for the chl at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in our md calculations the clean chl takes place at @xmath33 with the configuration @xmath34 and the minimal energy @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the valence configurations with @xmath36 , @xmath37 form well defined ring structure .    </S>",
    "<S> the increase of particle number disintegrates slowly the chl in the disk geometry , while the hexagonal lattice still exists . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , with each new shell , as soon as a new particle appears at the centre it gives rise to the chl again . since we deal with a finite system , restricted by the circular geometry , the boundary affects the plain symmetrical configurations giving rise to defects .    in conclusion , we disagree with the main outcome of the author s comment formulated in his summary . in order to argue against our model and corresponding conclusions , </S>",
    "<S> it is required a systematic thorough analysis of the system with increasing particle number but not only one particular case . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we have demonstrated that the cm predictions for external rings @xmath38 enable to us to reduce substantially scanning efforts needed to reach the ground state in the md . </S>"
