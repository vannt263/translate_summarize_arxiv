    "ever since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe by the supernova ( sn ) ia observations @xcite , many efforts have been made to understand the mechanism of this accelerated expansion .",
    "although different observations pointed to the existence of dark energy which has negative pressure and contributes about 72% of the matter content of the universe @xcite , the nature of dark energy is still a mystery to us . for a review of dark energy models",
    ", one may refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .    due to the lack of a satisfactory dark energy model",
    ", many parametric and non - parametric model - independent methods were proposed to study the property of dark energy and the geometry of the universe @xcite . in the reconstruction of the deceleration parameter @xmath1 , it was found that the strongest evidence of acceleration happens at redshift @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the sweet spot of the equation of state parameter @xmath3 was found to be around the redshift @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the energy conditions were also used to study the expansion of the universe in @xcite .",
    "the energy condition @xmath5 is equivalent to @xmath6 , and the energy condition @xmath7 is equivalent to @xmath8 for a flat universe .",
    "these conditions give lower bounds on the hubble parameter @xmath9 , and therefore upper bounds on the luminosity distance .",
    "these bounds can be put in the distance modulus - redshift graph to give direct model independent evidence of accelerated expansion . on the other hand , to the lowest order , the luminosity distance @xmath10 is independent of any cosmological model . in the low @xmath11 region ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath10 is degenerate .",
    "so different dark energy models will give almost the same @xmath10 in the low @xmath11 region and the current value @xmath0 of @xmath3 is not well constrained .",
    "that is the main reason why the sweet spot is found to be around @xmath13 . in this paper , we compare two dark energy models which differ only in the low @xmath11 region to further explain the consequence of the degeneracy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we apply the energy conditions to the flat universe to show model independent evidence of accelerated expansion . in section iii",
    ", we use two dark energy models to argue as to why the value of @xmath0 is not good for exploring the property of dark energy .",
    "the energy conditions are applied to the non - flat universe in section iv . in section",
    "v , we conclude the paper with some discussions .",
    "the strong energy condition @xmath5 and @xmath7 tells us that @xmath14    the hubble parameter @xmath15 and the deceleration parameter @xmath16 are related by the following equation , @xmath17d\\ln(1+u)\\right],\\ ] ] where the subscript 0 means the current value of the variable .",
    "therefore , the strong energy condition requires that @xmath18 and @xmath19 for redshift @xmath20 .",
    "note that the satisfying of eq .",
    "( [ sech ] ) guarantees the satisfying of eq .",
    "( [ sech1 ] ) . although eq .",

    "( [ sec ] ) , they are not equivalent . due to the integration effect , we can not derive eq .",
    "( [ sec ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ sech ] ) .",
    "if the strong energy condition is always satisfied , i.e. , the universe always experiences decelerated expansion , then there is a lower bound on the hubble parameter given by eq .",
    "( [ sech ] ) . when eq .",
    "( [ sech ] ) is violated , we conclude that the universe once experienced accelerated expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "if the universe always experiences accelerated expansion , then there is an upper bound on the hubble parameter .",
    "so if the hubble parameter satisfies eq .",
    "( [ sech ] ) , then we conclude that the universe once experienced decelerated expansion .",
    "the satisfying of eq .",
    "( [ sech1 ] ) means that the universe has experienced non - super - acceleration for a flat universe . from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear that these energy conditions can be used to show the evidence of acceleration and super - acceleration in the luminosity distance redshift diagram .",
    "we consider a flat universe first .",

    "( [ sec ] ) , but eqs .",
    "( [ sec ] ) and ( [ upperbound ] ) are not equivalent because the luminosity distance involves integration .",
    "to understand the integration effect , we use the @xmath24cdm model as an example . for @xmath24cdm model ,",
    "the universe experienced accelerated expansion in the redshift region @xmath25 and decelerated expansion in the redshift region @xmath26 . in other words ,",
    "the strong energy condition is violated in the redshift region @xmath25 , and satisfied in the redshift region @xmath26 .",
    "we plot the distance modulus @xmath27 for the @xmath24cdm model in fig .",
    "[ lcdm ] . from fig .",
    "[ lcdm ] , we see that @xmath27 for the @xmath24cdm model is outside the bound given by the lower solid line up to the redshift @xmath28 . of course",
    ", this does mean that we see the evidence of acceleration for the @xmath24cdm model in the high redshift region @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , from this graph it is incorrect to conclude that the strong energy condition was first violated billions of years ago , at @xmath30 in @xcite . for more detailed discussions on the integration effects ,",
    "what we can conclude from this graph are : ( a ) the strong energy condition eq . ( [ sec ] )",
    "leads to the upper bound eq .",
    "( [ upperbound ] ) on the luminosity distance , and the violation of eq .",

    "the solid line corresponds to the bound from the strong energy condition.,width=529 ]    now we are ready to apply the upper bounds ( [ upperbound ] ) to the discussion of the acceleration of the universe .",
    "we plot these upper bounds on @xmath27 in fig .",
    "the lower solid line corresponds to @xmath32 and the upper solid line corresponds to @xmath33 .",
    "if the universe always experiences decelerated expansion , then the distance modulus always stays in the shaded region .",
    "if some or all sn ia data are outside the shaded region , it means the universe has accelerated once in the past . on the other hand , if the universe always experiences accelerated expansion , then the distance modulus always stays above the lower solid line .",
    "if all the sn ia data are inside the shaded region , it means that the universe has once experienced decelerated expansion , but it does not mean that the universe has never accelerated .",
    "therefore , we can see the evidence of acceleration from the distance modulus graph directly without invoking any cosmological model or any statistical analysis .",

    "note that due to integration effect , even if some high @xmath11 sn ia data are outside the shaded region , it does not mean that we see evidence of acceleration in the high @xmath11 region .",
    "it is wrong to conclude that the strong energy condition is violated in the high redshift region @xmath38 .",
    "the correct conclusion is that the strong energy condition was once violated in the past .",
    "we may wonder about the low @xmath11 data . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we see that @xmath27 is almost independent of any model .",

    "we find that @xmath41 and this value is used .",
    "because @xmath27 is almost degenerate in the low redshift region @xmath12 , a current property of dark energy like @xmath0 is not well determined from the sn ia data .",

    "unlike the usual parametrization methods , there is no statistical analysis involved ; all we need to do is to put the sn ia data in the distance modulus - redshift graph and see if there are substantial numbers of sn ia data lying outside or inside the bound given by the strong energy condition .",
