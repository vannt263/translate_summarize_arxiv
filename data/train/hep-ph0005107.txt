    "in the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions aiming at studying the qcd phase transition of hot and dense matter , two - particle correlation is widely used to investigate the characteristics of the space - time evolution in the collision processes @xcite .",
    "it is well known as hanbury - brown twiss effect that the two - particle intensity correlation function contains the information on the `` size '' of the source of emitted particles due to a quantum symmetry . in recent experiments ,",
    "the sizes are estimated from the correlation function through gaussian fitting and the physical meaning of the sizes depends on the fitting function . for an azimuthally symmetric source , the yano - koonin - podgoretski(ykp )",
    "parametrization @xcite is used as one of the fitting functions . in this",
    "parametrization , three of fitting parameters can be regarded as source sizes directly .",
    "this advantage gives us a chance to observe a signature of quark - gluon matter because large emission duration is expected in the case of a first order phase transition @xcite . in the case of the relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the reaction is highly dynamic ; the particle source can not be considered to be static one .",
    "so we analyze the size parameters for pions quantitatively based on a hydrodynamic model which takes into account the longitudinal and transverse expansion and a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "from a hydrodynamic point of view , we consider the pion source as a thermalized one and a completely chaotic source .",
    "hence , the two - particle correlation function is given as @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are momenta of a emitted pion pair and @xmath3 is the interference term .",
    "as usual , we introduce the relative momentum @xmath4 and the average momentum @xmath5 which can be put as @xmath6 by virtue of the cylindrical symmetry . due to the on - shell condition , @xmath7 , only three components of the relative momenta are independent . in the ykp parametrization , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10",
    "are used as the independent components .",
    "then , the fitting function is given by @xmath11 \\right.\\\\   \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\left .",
    "-\\left [       r_0 ^ 2(k^\\mu)+r_\\|^2(k^\\mu )       \\right ]   \\left [    q_\\mu u^\\mu ( k^\\mu )    \\right]^2     \\right\\ } , \\label{ykp}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a four - velocity which has only longitudinal component .",
    "the size parameters to be determined by a fit are @xmath13s @xmath14 .",
    "we may choose a special reference frame where the velocity parameter @xmath15 vanishes ( ykp frame ) , because the three size parameters are invariant under longitudinal boosts . introducing the source function , @xmath16 and the weighted average , @xmath17 the size parameters in this frame ( ykp frame )",
    "are expressed as @xmath18,\\label{r0}\\\\   r_\\|^2(k^\\mu)&=&(\\delta z)^2    -\\frac{2\\beta_\\|}{\\beta_\\bot}\\langle \\tilde{x}\\tilde{z } \\rangle    + \\frac{\\beta_\\|^2}{\\beta_\\bot^2}[(\\delta x)^2-(\\delta y)^2],\\label{rl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    in order to regard the above",
    "@xmath13s as naive source sizes directly , the second term and the third term in the right hand side of eqs.([r0 ] ) and ( [ rl ] ) must be small compared to the first term of each equation . though it has been shown that this condition holds within a class of thermal model @xcite , it is not trivial in other cases .",
    "the case of a hydrodynamic model as a more realistic one is the point of the present paper . in the following ,",
    "we calculate three quantities : hbt radii extracted from the fit to eq.([c2 ] ) , the space - time extensions , eqs.([rt])-([rl ] ) , and the source sizes , the first terms in eqs.([r0 ] ) and ( [ rl ] ) .",
    "+    fig .  1 @xmath23 dependence of ykp radii .",
    "open and closed circles show the experimental data and hbt radii , respectively .",
    "solid lines stand for space - time extensions ( [ rt])-([rl ] ) .",
    "dotted lines stand for source sizes .",
    "( @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 . )     + figure 1 shows @xmath23 dependence of the pion hbt radii .",
    "close circles stand for the hbt radii .",
    "solid lines are space - time extensions which are expected to agree with the hbt radii when only thermal pions are considered .",
    "dotted lines stand for the source sizes ( @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 ) .",
    "as far as @xmath28 and @xmath25 are concerned , those quantities seem to be consistent with one another and well reproduce the na49 experimental results @xcite ( open circles ) . on the other hand , @xmath27 is smaller than the experimental one in spite of the fact our calculation includes a first order phase transition . the time durations @xmath26 agrees with @xmath27 at small @xmath23 .",
    "however , some deviations from @xmath27 can be seen at large @xmath23 region , that means a failure of interpretation of @xmath27 as the time duration .",
    "we find that this difference occurs from the third term in eq.([r0 ] ) .    in eq.([r0 ] ) , the two additional terms means correlation between @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( the second term ) and the thickness of the source ( the third term ) .",
    "though contribution from the second term is small in our model , the third term becomes negative in same order with @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "such a kind of the source is called an `` opaque source '' . the `` opaque '' source",
    "@xcite emits particles dominantly from the surface and the `` transparent '' source emits from whole region .",
    "figure 2 shows the source function ( [ s ] ) projected onto the @xmath32 plane , @xmath33 being normalized as @xmath34 .",
    "note that the average transverse momentum of the emitted pions is parallel to @xmath29 direction in the figure .",
    "the left figure shows _ clearly _ surface emission ; pions are emitted from the crescent region and the source is thinner in the @xmath29 direction than in the @xmath35 direction .",
    "this is the typical property of the opaque source which appears in the factor @xmath36 in eq.([r0 ] ) .",
    "note that this factor also appears in the longitudinal components of the size , eq.([rl ] ) , but the prefactor @xmath37 makes the contribution to @xmath38 small . if we neglected the transverse flow by artificially putting @xmath39 , the source function becomes as shown in the right figure in fig .  2 .",
    "in this case , the source function is proportional to the space - time volume of freeze - out hypersurface . as a consequence of restoration of the azimuthal symmetry which is shown clearly in the figure , the above measure of source opacity vanishes . although the particle emission takes place almost from the thin surface , the source is not opaque in this sense .",
    "when the transverse flow exists , the source function is deformed by thermal boltzmann factor @xmath40 with @xmath41 almost proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , the number of emitted particles increases in the region where @xmath43 ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) and decreases in the region where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this flow effect deforms the surface dominant volume distribution ( right figure ) to the crescent shape ( left figure ) .",
    "2 the source functions as functions of transverse coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath35 for @xmath47 mev and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) . the left figure denotes the source function with the transverse flow .",
    "the right figure denotes the source function _ without _ transverse flow .",
    "+ in summary , we analyze @xmath23 dependence of source parameters of the ykp parametrization based on the relativistic hydrodynamics for the cern - sps 158 gev / a pb+pb collisions .",
    "we obtain the results which are almost consistent with the experiment .",
    "however , the temporal source parameter , @xmath27 , shows smaller value than the experiment .",
    "the source opacity makes the interpretation of @xmath27 as the time duration doubtful at large @xmath23 region .",
    "we find that the source opacity is caused by the transverse flow and the characteristics of the freeze - out hypersurface , the surface dominant freeze - out .",
    "the deviations of our results from the experiment would be improved by including the resonance decay and other effects .",
