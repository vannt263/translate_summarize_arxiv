    "positronium ( ps ) , the bound state of an electron and positron , is a pure quantum electro - dynamical system providing a highly sensitive field for testing bound state quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "the triplet ( @xmath5 ) state of ps , orthopositronium ( o - ps ) , will in most cases decay into three photons due to odd - parity under the c - transformation . because o - ps has a lifetime about 1140 times longer compared to the singlet state , parapositronium ( p - ps ) , this enables direct and precise measurement of the intrinsic decay rate of orthopositronium , @xmath6 @xcite ,",
    "although obtained values are much larger , i.e. , 5.2 and 8.2 experimental standard deviations , than a recent non - relativistic qed calculation ( @xmath7 ) corrected up to @xmath3 @xcite . to elucidate discrepancies ,",
    "a variety of experiments have since been carried out to search for the exotic decay mode of o - ps , resulting in no evidence so far @xcite .    as some fraction of o - ps inevitably results in pick - off annihilations due to collisions with atomic electrons of the target material ,",
    "the observed o - ps decay rate @xmath8 is a sum of the intrinsic o - ps decay rate @xmath6 and the pick - off annihilation rate into @xmath1 s , @xmath9 , i.e. ,    @xmath10    contributions from exotic decays are assumed to be zero because they are confirmed to be less than @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 is proportional to the rate of o - ps collisions with the target materials , i.e. ; @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the density of the target , @xmath15 is the annihilation cross section , and @xmath16 the time dependent velocity of o - ps . due to the thermalization process of o - ps , this necessitates expressing @xmath9 as a function of time whose properties are dependent on the surrounding materials .    in previous measurements",
    "@xcite , @xmath8 s were measured by varying the densities of the target materials ( @xmath14 ) or size of the cavities . for the uniform distribution of o - ps in the cavity",
    ", @xmath9 is depending on the size and shape of the cavity due to the relation , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the average o - ps velocity , @xmath19 is the cavity surface area , and @xmath20 is the volume of the cavity .",
    "the extrapolation to zero gas density or infinite cavity size was expected to yield the decay rate in a vacuum , @xmath21 , under the assumption of quick thermalization with constant o - ps velocity .",
    "however , this assumption contains a serious systematic error as pointed out in reference @xcite in that it would make the obtained decay rate larger than the true value ; i.e. , the time - spectrum fitting was carried out using a simple exponential function , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 represents the flat spectrum of accidental events . in order to cleanly eliminate the contribution from the prompt annihilations and fast p - ps decay component , the decay spectrum needs to be fitted for times after these components decay away .",
    "a somewhat fast , beginning time of the fitting range was adopted to obtain the high statistics : the cavity experiment typically used @xmath24 for all runs @xcite , while the gas experiment @xcite used @xmath25 for all gases except the lowest pressure @xmath26 and neopentane runs .",
    "because it takes several hundred @xmath27 for o - ps to thermalize via elastic collisions with surrounding molecules to an ultimate energy of about @xmath28ev depending on the type of target material @xcite , such fast @xmath29 tends to result in larger values of @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , in the cavity experiment , o - ps is not well thermalized due to the small escape and collision rates .",
    "the new technique called _ the direct @xmath1 correction method _ was introduced to overcome the problem regarding the extrapolation .",
    "the following section briefly explains its concept and procedure .",
    "once a precise thermalization function is obtained , @xmath12 will contain all information about the process .",
    "the population of o - ps at time @xmath30 , @xmath31 can be expressed as @xmath32    the energy distribution of photons from the 3-body decay is continuous below the steep edge at 511  kev , whereas the pick - off annihilation is 2-body which produces a 511  kev monochromatic peak .",
    "energy and timing information are simultaneously measured with high - energy resolution germanium detectors such that @xmath33 can be determined from the energy spectrum of the emitted photon .",
    "providing the ratio is determined as a function of time , the intrinsic decay rate of o - ps , @xmath21 , can be directly obtained by fitting the observed time spectrum .",
    "the direct @xmath1 correction method makes any extrapolation procedure unnecessary and precluding use of the hypothesis of linear dependence at vacuum limit or o - ps behavior at the material surface .",
    "the direct 2@xmath34 correction method first applied in 1995 @xcite provided consistent results with qed predictions , yet several problems remained : ( i ) accuracy was @xmath35 , being worse than those of the other experiments @xcite , ( ii ) decay rates systematically increased before @xmath36 due to an unknown reason , and therefore to remove this uncertainty , final results were obtained using data after @xmath37 , and ( ii ) systematic error regarding the stark effect was not estimated . improving the method by considering these problems will be described in the later sections .",
    "we employed a @xmath38 positron source ( dia . ,",
    "@xmath39 ) with approximate strength of @xmath40 , being sandwiched between two sheets of plastic scintillators ( ne104 ) and held by a cone made of aluminized mylar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the scintillators and mylar were @xmath41- and @xmath42-thick , respectively , corresponding to a total area density of about @xmath43 .",
    "the cone is situated at the center of a cylindrical @xmath44-diameter vacuum container made of @xmath45-thick glass , being filled with @xmath46 powder and evacuated down to @xmath47 torr .",
    "two different types of @xmath0 powder ( nippon aerosil ltd . ) were used ( table  [ table : powder ] ) , with the biggest difference being in the mean distance between grains ( @xmath48 vs. @xmath49 ) such that different pick - off ratio would be obtained . using these powders ,",
    "two 6-month runs were performed ( run1 and 2 ) . to remove water molecules absorbed on the grain surface ,",
    "the powder was heated just before evacuation .",
    ".characteristics of @xmath0 powders used in the measurements . [ cols=\"^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the sources of systematic errors are summarized in table  [ table : systematic ] and each item is depicted in the following discussions .",
    "tdc module related errors : calibration accuracy ( @xmath50 ) and stability of the calibration oscillator ( @xmath51 ) are known as they are product specifications , while integral ( @xmath52 ) and differential ( negligible ) non linearities are evaluated using basic performance of the 2-ghz tdc .",
    "cut condition errors : systematic errors for base - line selections and pile - up rejections were assessed by changing the cut criteria .",
    "the base - line cut was intentionally changed from @xmath53 to @xmath54 where the @xmath55 represents standard deviation of the base - line distribution .",
    "the decay rate results are compared with the nominal result with @xmath56 , and systematic error is estimated as @xmath57 for run1 and @xmath58 for run2 . regarding the pile - up events rejection , the wd - nw cut condition was changed from @xmath59 to @xmath60 to estimate deviation from the nominal condition which is @xmath61  kev , and is estimated as @xmath62 for run1 and @xmath63 for run2 .",
    "the dependence on the energy cut condition and trigger pmt threshold are considered to have a negligible effect .",
    "monte carlo simulation related errors : the predominant contribution to total systematic error is produced by uncertain normalization .",
    "that is , the number of pick - off events are determined by subtracting the normalized 3-@xmath34 spectrum of monte carlo simulation from the o - ps spectrum , where changing the normalization factor affects the @xmath33 values and eventually propagates to the final result . since the sharp fall - off of the 3@xmath34-spectrum at 511  kev",
    "is solely produced by the good ge energy resolution of @xmath64  kev , this subtraction only affects the lower side of the pick - off spectrum such that improper subtraction results in asymmetry of the pick - off spectrum shape .",
    "comparison of the asymmetries of the pick - off peak shape and the prompt peak annihilation spectrum is a good parameter for estimating this systematic error .",
    "the 1  @xmath55 error is assessed as @xmath65 for run1 and @xmath66 for run2 .",
    "other mc simulation related errors : the relative efficiency of the nai(tl ) scintillators , @xmath67 , has an uncertainty of @xmath68 evaluated using a comparison of the energy spectrum of data and that of the simulation which reproduces data within an uncertainty of 2% except for the compton free region where the deviation is 5% ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "@xmath0 powder density in the mc simulation is conservatively changed by @xmath70 although the uniformity is known to be within a few % ; a change resulting in an error of @xmath71  ppm .    stark shift errors : the stark shift stretches the lifetime of ps atoms , i.e. , a perturbative calculation shows that the shift is proportional to a square of the effective electric field @xmath72 such that @xmath73 @xcite , where @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath72 is defined as the root - mean - square electric field sensed by o - ps during its lifetime .",
    "calculations have estimated two contributions exist based on measurements of the electrical charge - up on the primary grains of silica powders and electrical dipole moment on the surface of grains @xcite .",
    "the charge - up is partly intrinsic depending on powder specifications and partly due to positron depositions from the @xmath75 source .",
    "the effect , however , is negligible in both cases , i.e. , on the level of @xmath76 at most .",
    "silanol functional groups on the surface of the powder grain behave as an electrical dipole moment creating an effective field around the grains .",
    "average densities are known to be as @xmath77 and @xmath78 for run 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the effective field can be analytically calculated such that the contribution to the o - ps decay rate is determined to be @xmath79 for run1 and @xmath80 for run2 .",
    "these estimations were confirmed using results from precise hyper - fine - structure ( hfs ) interval measurements of ground state ps in silica powder @xcite , where the interval is proportional to the size of stark effect .",
    "considering the difference in powder densities used , the hfs results are consistent with our estimation .",
    "other sources of systematic errors : error contribution due to the zeeman effect is estimated using the measured absolute magnetic field around the positronium assembly ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "since the 3-@xmath34 pick - off process can only occur at a certain ratio , the calculated relative frequency @xmath82 is consistent with previous measurements @xcite , being @xmath83 for run1 and @xmath84 for run2 .",
    "the probability of the excited state ( n=2 ) of ps is about @xmath85 @xcite , which could make the intrinsic decay rate @xmath86 smaller due to the low decay rate ( @xmath87 )    the above discussed systematic errors are regarded as independent contributions such that the total systematic error can be calculated as their quadratic sum , resulting in @xmath88 , @xmath89 for run1 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 for run2 .",
    "-corrected nrqed prediction @xcite .",
    "small vertical lines on the error bars indicate the size of errors solely due to statistics while error bars represent total ambiguities including systematic errors . ]",
    "the decay rate of o - ps formed in @xmath0 was measured using a direct @xmath1 correction method in which the thermalization effect of o - ps is accounted for and integrated into the time spectrum fitting procedure .",
    "results were obtained using two runs with different types of @xmath0 powders , i.e. , @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xmath94 . based on the results of both runs , a weighted average gave @xmath95 , being 1.8 times more accurate than previous @xmath0 measurement @xcite . while this value agrees well with previous result , it disagrees with recent high - precision measurements , i.e. , by @xmath96 @xcite and @xmath97 @xcite . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : history ] , our value agrees well with the nrqed prediction corrected up to @xmath3 term @xcite .",
    "in fact , the resultant decay rates were confirmed to be independent of fitting start time after @xmath98 for run1(2 ) , and systematic increase in decay rate observed in previous measurement before @xmath36 @xcite was eliminated using the new system ; this improvement directly contributed to reduce the statistical error .",
