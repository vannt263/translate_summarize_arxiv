    "the observational evidence that nonbaryonic dark matter comprises most of the mass in the universe is extremely strong , but the nature of dark - matter particles remains a mystery .",
    "no particle included in the standard model of particle physics has the characteristics required to explain the dark matter . in its original formulation , the standard model described all known particles , including neutrinos , which were assumed to be massless .",
    "the discovery that neutrinos have mass has forced one to go beyond this minimal model : a modest extension of the standard model by gauge singlet fermions can accommodate the neutrino masses . one or more of these gauge - singlet fermions can have majorana masses below the electroweak scale , in which case they appear as sterile neutrinos in the low - energy theory .",
    "if one of the sterile neutrinos has mass in the 120  kev range and has small mixing angles with the active neutrinos ( as expected ) , such a particle is a plausible candidate for dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the same particle could be produced in a supernova explosion , and its emission from a cooling neutron star could explain the pulsar kicks @xcite , could facilitate core collapse supernova explosions  @xcite and can affect the formation of the first stars  @xcite and black holes  @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a strong motivation to search for signatures of sterile neutrinos in this mass range .    the most promising way to discover ( or rule out )",
    "relic sterile neutrinos is with the use of x - ray telescopes ( xrts ) , such as _ suzaku_. the sterile neutrinos can decay radiatively  @xcite and produce a lighter neutrino and a photon amenable to x - ray observation  @xcite .",
    "since this is a two - body decay , a line is expected in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the dwarf spheroidal galaxies are ideal targets for these observations because of their proximity , high dark matter density @xcite , and absence of additional obscuring x - ray sources ( see below ) .",
    "the ursa minor and draco dwarf spheroidals are the optimal targets in this class for large field - of - view x - ray spectroscopic investigation , based on their average dark matter surface densities . from _ xmm - newton _ observations of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal , sterile neutrino line flux limits comparable to the best previous constraints",

    "the _ suzaku _",
    "observatory @xcite provides the most sensitive instruments for current searches for weak sterile neutrino radiative decay lines in the @xmath2 kev bandpass because of its low and stable background @xcite , and the relatively sharp spectral resolution of its ccd spectrometers @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we discuss our analysis of _ suzaku _ observations of the ursa minor system , considerably improving on the _ xmm - newton _ constraints ; a companion article on the draco system is in preparation .",

    "sterile neutrinos may be produced through non - resonant oscillations , as proposed by dodelson and widrow @xcite , and via various other mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "a generic prediction is that relic sterile neutrinos must decay into a lighter neutrino and a photon .",
    "since this is a two - body decay of a particle with mass @xmath0 , decay photons produce an intrinsically narrow line with energy @xmath3 that can be detected using x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "while the decay timescale , @xmath4 , greatly exceeds the hubble time , the emissivity may reach detectable levels in regions of large dark matter concentration .",
    "upper limits on @xmath5 from x - ray observations of the cosmic background @xcite , galaxy clusters @xcite , and m31 @xcite may be complemented and improved by observing dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "there is no consensus as to whether dark matter is cold or warm based on observations of small - scale structure .",
    "cold and warm dark matter reproduce large - scale structure equally well , but differ in their predictions on scales comparable to the free - streaming length .",
    "ly@xmath6 forest clouds provide a tracer population of the perturbation spectrum on the appropriate ( non - linear ) scale that may be used to place an upper limit on the free - streaming length @xcite , and have been interpreted as implying that the mass of the dark matter sterile neutrino , @xmath0 , must be greater than @xmath7kev @xcite for production exclusively by the dodelson - widrow ( dw ) non - resonant mixing mechanism . however , @xmath8-body simulations and observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies imply a lower mass @xcite . in scenarios with alternative production mechanisms that do not involve oscillations ,",
    "sterile neutrinos may effectively be colder , allowing masses as low as 3  kev to be consistent with the ly@xmath6 observations  @xcite . in this case , the photometric and kinematic data from dwarf spheroidal galaxies  @xcite can be satisfied by dark matter in the form of sterile neutrinos with mass between 0.5  kev and 1.3  kev  @xcite .",
    "constraints on sterile neutrino parameters may be further relaxed in mixed dark matter models @xcite and in models where sterile neutrinos are produced in resonant oscillations in the presence of significant lepton asymmetries @xcite . since the sterile neutrino distribution function may substantially deviate from thermal equilibrium @xcite , simple scaling arguments and alterations to the power spectrum ( e.g. , imposing a cutoff )",
    "do not suffice .",
    "new large - scale structure formation simulations with the appropriate revisions are required to re - evaluate the constraints from ly@xmath6 data @xcite .",
    "moreover , their interpretation relies on a thorough understanding of the uncertain thermal and ionization evolution of the intergalactic medium , which may be affected by the properties and interactions of dark - matter particles  @xcite .",
    "hence , we present limits solely derived from our x - ray data .",
    "the sterile neutrino mass and the mixing angle @xmath1 determine the rate of radiative decay to active neutrinos and x - ray photons : @xmath9 .",

    "one may be able to eliminate one of these two parameters by requiring that the total density match that of dark matter in the universe as inferred from observations .",
    "however , given the various possible mechanisms for producing sterile neutrinos , and the possibility that sterile neutrinos may account for some  but not all  dark matter @xcite , one should keep an open mind and search all the available parameter space in the @xmath13 plane .",

    "our analysis generally follows the procedures outlined in `` the suzaku data reduction guide , '' as implemented in heasoft version 6.5.1 .",
    "we recalculate pi values and grades , select event grades ( 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 ) that correspond to x - ray photon events , filter on pixel status ( eliminating bad charge transfer efficiency columns , and rows invalidated by the charge injection process ) and select good time intervals ( gti ) based on pointing , data and telemetry rates , saa proximity ( `` @xmath18 '' ) , and proximity to the earth s limb and illuminated earth ( `` @xmath19 '' ) .",

    "the spectra from the fi chips , xis0 and xis3 , are co - added and a weighted xis0 + 3 response function calculated .",

    "a baseline model is constructed as follows .",
    "( 1 ) we fit the generated nxb spectra ( section 2.2.2 ) over the full 0.4 - 12 kev band with a model consisting of two power - law components plus 10 narrow gaussian lines with energies fixed at values given in the _ suzaku _ technical description .",
    "xis0 + 3 and xis1 spectra are fitted independently at this stage .",
    "( 2 ) next , we partition the bandpass into five intervals ( 0.45 - 0.65 kev , 0.65 - 1.3 kev , 1.3 - 2.6 kev , 2.6 - 5.2 kev , 5.2-e@xmath42 kev , where e@xmath42 = 10.4 kev for xis0 + 3 and 7.6 kev for xis1 ) and refit each nxb spectral segment with the model described above ( including only those lines that fall within the segment under consideration ) , allowing line energies and normalizations to freely vary .",
    "if fits are improved by the inclusion of additional lines , by the replacement of gaussian with lorentzian line profiles , or by introducing finite line widths , these adjustments are implemented .",
    "the partitioning results in two line - free ( 0.65 - 1.3 kev , 2.6 - 5.2 kev ) and two line - rich segments ( 1.3 - 2.6 kev , 5.2-e@xmath42 kev ) with total counts fairly evenly apportioned among these four ( see table 1 for total bandpass counts for each detector ) .",
    "( 3 ) all 10 xis0 + 3 and xis1 nxb sub - spectra are then simultaneously fitted with line energies fixed at their locally determined values and one of the two power laws constrained to be the same for all spectra .",

    "gxb+cxb model components differ only by a constant multiplicative scale factor for xis1 relative to xis0 + 3 , to allow for residual flux cross - calibration offsets .",
    "all nxb line fluxes , one power - law index and two power - law norms are allowed to independently vary in each spectral segment for each detector ( allowing both power - law indices to vary independently did not improve the fits ) . backfitting the best - fit gxb+cxb model components to the nxb - subtracted spectra described above yields acceptable fits",
    "; however , this is not the case when fitting the estimated nxb spectra with the best - fit nxb components .",
    "evidently there are non - negligible ( for our purposes ) differences between the estimated and true nxb .",

    "allowing the full range of nxb+gxb+cxb parameters of interest to vary provides a relatively conservative limit , while also utilizing unbinned , unsubtracted spectra enables us to consider energies for the extra line up to @xmath43 kev ( in xis0 + 3 ) .",
    "the issue of placing upper confidence limits on a quantity bounded from below @xcite is mitigated since we can allow line fluxes to go negative without the total spectrum falling below zero .",

    "this is shown in figure 10 , where our line flux upper limits are compared with the dw predictions .      because different criteria for estimating line flux upper limits are used , a precise comparison with previous results is difficult .",
    "our limits are about a factor of 3 better than those for ursa minor in @xcite over the overlapping bandpass .",
    "the constraints shown in figure 9 are comparable to the combined constraints from the milky way @xcite and m31 @xcite , and slightly tighter than those from the unresolved _ chandra _ cxb @xcite and from the `` bullet '' cluster , 1e 0657 - 56 @xcite .",
    "@xcite compiled and plotted various x - ray limits on the combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we attain a comparable level of sensitivity over the entire 1 - 20 kev mass range with a _ suzaku _",
    "observation of a single object .",
    "with a single _ suzaku _ observation of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal , we have derived limits on the mass and mixing angle of the sterile neutrino dark matter candidate that are comparable to or better than previous constraints .",
    "these limits are illustrated in figure  [ figure : suzaku_limits ] for the case where sterile neutrinos comprise all of the dark matter regardless of how they are produced in the early universe and , in the more general case , when their abundance is not assumed , but is calculated under the assumptions that minimize it .",
    "the best estimate of the total projected dark matter mass within 400 pc of @xmath102 @xmath34 is adopted here .",
    "if solely produced by the dw mechanism , sterile neutrinos can not constitute 100% of the dark matter in ursa minor unless they are less massive than 2.5 kev .",
    "because of its orbit , _ suzaku _ has a lower and more stable background than either the _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ observatories , and its spectrometers have sharper energy resolution .",
    "our approach in deriving limits utilizes the c - statistic to evaluate a very general model fit to the data with minimal pre - processing and no background subtraction .",
    "thus , there are no a priori assumptions about the accuracy of the nxb estimate that we only use to set line energies and shapes , or whether an extra line feature lies above or below the total continuum .",
    "our final limits are those that correspond to a change in the c - statistic that occurred in 1% of our monte carlo simulations",
    ". these factors may account for why our constraints represent only modest improvements over previously published limits despite the more optimal characteristics of _ suzaku_. as the nxb characterization improves , it may be possible to tighten upper limits in the @xmath103 kev regime ; at lower masses , the ubiquity of the gxb will remain a barrier until significantly higher energy resolution is attained ",
    "e.g. , with _",
    "astro - h_.    since there is some uncertainty as to the dynamical state of dwarf spheroidals on an individual basis , x - ray constraints obtained from additional systems are warranted ( e.g. , our paper  in preparation  on the _ suzaku _ observation of the draco system ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has approximately doubled the number of galaxies identified with the local group population and revealed a new sub - population of faint milky way satellites @xcite , including some with very high mass - to - light ratio @xcite that  with the right observational setup  may provide the best targets for investigations of this type .",
    "finally , predictions of the ly@xmath6 forest power spectrum in fully self - consistent large - scale structure simulations with sterile neutrinos can provide complementary constraints in the form of a lower limit on the particle mass .",
    "sterile neutrinos remain a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "for example , a sterile neutrino with a mass of @xmath104 kev and @xmath105 could account for all of the dark matter ( or @xmath106%@xmath107% if produced solely by the dw mechanism ) and explain pulsar kicks @xcite without violating the line flux upper limits .",
