    "the study of @xmath7 violation in @xmath8 mesons is still in its early stages with many contemporary experiments and analyses focussing on the decay @xmath1 .",
    "the interest in this particular channel owes to the observation that the final state @xmath9 is reached by interference of a decay without mixing , @xmath10 , and with mixing , @xmath11 . in principle , this allows for the observation of the @xmath7 violating phase , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the standard model angle in the unitarity triangle for the @xmath14 system .",
    "practically , it is predicted to be small , @xmath15  @xcite , about 20 times smaller in magnitude than the corresponding phase in @xmath16 mixing .",
    "the mixing occurs in the standard model due the nonequivalence of mass and flavor eigenstates and gives rise to particle - antiparticle oscillations .",
    "they are described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark - mixing matrix nowadays established as the leading paradigm for @xmath7 violation .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath14 oscillation follows from the perturbative solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed review of the formalism ) , written as , @xmath17 the complex @xmath18 mass and decay rate matrices , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are hermitian and diagonalization of @xmath21 yields the mass eigenstates @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and decay rates , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are distinct .",
    "the complex numbers , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are related to the matrix elements of @xmath19 and @xmath20 by , @xmath28 \\ ,    \\label{qp}\\ ] ] and satisfy @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30 oscillations in eq .",
    "( [ schroedinger ] ) involve the physical quantities @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the @xmath7 violating phase @xmath33 .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix element @xmath34 is important as it represents the partial width of @xmath14 and @xmath35 decays to common final states and is related to the decay width difference @xmath36 between the two mass eigenstates by , @xmath37 whereas the mass difference in eq .",
    "( [ qp ] ) is proportional to the off - diagonal element @xmath38 , @xmath39 and equals the frequency of the @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "the two mass eigenstates of @xmath40 mesons are expected to be almost pure @xmath7 eigenstates when @xmath41 is negligible , which is the case for @xmath42 and @xmath43 is approximately real in the standard model ( since @xmath44 is very small ) . by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ qp ] ) it follows that @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( to within 1%  @xcite )",
    ". however , experiment seems to indicate that @xmath47 could be as large as 22% for the @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "we shall return to this point shortly in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "the time - dependent @xmath7-violating asymmetry for @xmath48 is defined to be , @xmath49 and can be shown to be written as  @xcite , @xmath50 \\ ! / ( 1 + | \\lambda_{j/\\psi \\phi } \\",
    "|^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided @xmath47 is small and @xmath51 .",
    "we made use of the definition , @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the complex decay amplitude , @xmath54 is the @xmath7 conjugate amplitude and @xmath55 describes @xmath7-even and -odd components in the final state , the separation of which requires an angular analysis  @xcite .",
    "for the so - called third type of @xmath7 violation with and without mixing , one has in addition to @xmath56 also the condition @xmath57 , , the decay amplitude @xmath53 receives penguin contributions from the two ckm terms @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 in the wolfenstein parametrization  @xcite .",
    "the tree diagram also contains the weak phase @xmath61 so that the penguin amplitude proportional to @xmath62 is ckm suppressed and additionally subleading in the strong coupling @xmath63 . as a consequence , neglecting this term , the dominant tree and penguin amplitudes effectively contribute a single overall weak phase which leads to @xmath57 and no _ direct _ @xmath7 violation occurs . ] so that @xmath64 : @xmath65 hence , the asymmetry directly measures the phase differences between particular ckm matrix elements and introduces no uncertainty due to strong interaction phases , which are often of non - perturbative origin and not well known ; namely , the strong interaction effects all cancel exactly since @xmath66 or at least very close to 1 . since @xmath13 is predicted to be very small in the standard model , no appreciable @xmath7 violation should be detected in experiment .",
    "therefore , any large deviation from this prediction could indicate new physics ( np ) contributions manifest in the modified mixing phase : @xmath67",
    "first experimental determinations of @xmath13 have come from the cdf  @xcite and d@xmath4  @xcite collaborations and their initial values hinted at a possible large deviation ( of order @xmath69 if both results are combined ) from the standard model .",
    "the latest d@xmath4 measurements  @xcite of @xmath36 and @xmath13 are only marginally smaller than those in  @xcite and in particular @xmath70ps@xmath71 . however , an updated cdf measurement seems to be more consistent  @xcite with the standard model values .",
    "one is hopeful that lhcb will provide tighter constraints on @xmath13 and @xmath36 in the near future .",
    "it was already mentioned that @xmath7 violation can be measured using angular analyses since the final state @xmath72 is not a @xmath7 eigenstate .",
    "this requires more events to acquire a similar sensitivity to that obtained if the decay proceeds solely via @xmath7-even or @xmath7-odd channels .",
    "the related channel @xmath2 is in that sense advantageous , as the decay is to a single @xmath7-odd eigenstate and does not require an angular analysis . as in the case of @xmath1 , its @xmath7 violating phase",
    "is given by @xmath12 up to higher corrections .",
    "however , as for other scalar mesons , the exact flavor and constituent content is not known to date .",
    "ground state with a non - perturbative kernel beyond the rainbow - ladder truncation determines the mass of the flavor - pure scalar to be @xmath73  mev  @xcite .",
    "a more sophisticated description in terms of a mixing angle between @xmath74 and @xmath75 components has not been realized yet but is feasible .",
    "further improvements include pion- and kaon - loop effects in the non - perturbative kernel which can shift the pole mass by about 8%  @xcite",
    ". in short , viewing scalar mesons , such as the @xmath76 , exclusively as a @xmath77 or @xmath78 state may simply be too naive  @xcite . ] the mass of the @xmath76 is well estimated at @xmath79  mev , yet its width is only poorly known due to the nearby opening of the @xmath80 channel and its dependence on a given final state .",
    "it can be rather narrow in the case of @xmath81 decays and estimates of the width are in the range @xmath82  mev  @xcite . for a general overview of scalar mesons",
    "we refer to the review by c.  amsler _ et al_. in the particle data group book  @xcite and references therein .",
    "it has also been argued that the angular analysis in the decay @xmath1 is complicated by the @xmath83 channel , since it contributes @xmath84-wave @xmath85 pairs which can interfere with those originating from the @xmath86 .",
    "this @xmath84-wave should also be manifest in the appearance of @xmath87 decays . following this observation ,",
    "the level of @xmath84-wave `` contamination '' was proposed to be estimated by the following ratio  @xcite : @xmath88 initial estimates based on similar decays in the charm sector show this ratio to be of the order of @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "these estimates rely on experimental data on @xmath90 and @xmath91 decay rates and seem to indicate that the @xmath84-wave contribution of @xmath92 can not be ignored when analyzing the angle @xmath13 in @xmath48 .",
    "likewise , xie _ et al_. found the effect of an @xmath84-wave component on @xmath12 to be of the order of @xmath93 in the @xmath86 resonance region  @xcite .",
    "a first calculation of this ratio based on decay amplitudes derived in qcd factorization ( qcdf ) and a model calculation of the non - perturbative transition amplitude @xmath94  @xcite are discussed in the following sections .",
    "a treatment of possible @xmath84-wave contributions in experimental analyses was presented in a recent analysis of @xmath13  @xcite . in there",
    ", the cdf collaboration finds that @xmath84-wave contribution within @xmath95 mev about the @xmath86 meson is less that 6.7% at 95% confidence level .",
    "incidentally , these preliminary cdf results  @xcite on @xmath13 and @xmath20 point at a reconciliation with the standard model values and it remains to be clarified which impact on the analyses the additional @xmath84-wave contribution have .",
    "the details of the @xmath96 and @xmath97 decay amplitudes calculated in qcdf can be found in ref .",
    "we here concentrate on the nonperturbative matrix element that emerges from the factorized amplitude .",
    "the amplitude of interest is the heavy - to - light transition between a @xmath14 and the scalar @xmath76 meson which decomposed into lorentz invariants gives rise to two form factors , @xmath98 with @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the matrix element of the @xmath103 transition amplitude is given by a similar decomposition and introduces five more form factors  @xcite .",
    "common relativistic quark - model approaches represent heavy - to - light transition amplitudes by triangle diagrams , a 3-point function between the bethe - salpeter amplitudes ( bsa ) of a heavy @xmath104 and a light @xmath105 meson and the weak coupling represented by the transition amplitude @xmath106 .",
    "this is the generalized impulse approximation , which in the language of dyson - schwinger equations  @xcite is the leading term in their systematic and symmetry preserving truncation : @xmath107 where @xmath108 are ( dressed ) quark propagators , @xmath109 ; @xmath110 ; @xmath111 is the light meson bsa with @xmath112 and the index @xmath113 indicates its possible vector structure .",
    "@xmath114 or @xmath115 is the interaction vertex and @xmath116 is the heavy meson bsa .",
    "the trace is over dirac and color indices .",
    "calculation of these matrix elements in lattice - regularized qcd or with qcd sum rules follows a somewhat different approach based on heavy - light correlation functions .",
    "a brief review on effective and non - perturbative approaches to heavy - light transition form factors and in particular discrepancies between model predictions at large time - like momentum transfer , @xmath117 , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite    as discussed earlier , the lack of a precise constituent picture of the scalar @xmath76 makes a precision calculation of the transition matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ defbs ] ) impossible for the time being .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath118 form factors have recently been obtained in qcd sum rules  @xcite and pqcd  @xcite for @xmath119 , where an extrapolation to the value @xmath120 is required .",
    "they have also been calculated by some of us  @xcite from the constituent quark three - point function , the vertices of which are the weak interaction coupling , @xmath121 , and two bsa for the @xmath8 and @xmath76 mesons . in this relativistic dispersion - relation model , a phenomenological parametrization of the @xmath8",
    "is obtained from the simultaneous calculation of the weak decay constant @xmath122 ( known from lattice - qcd simulations ) . in an attempt to find a suitable form of the @xmath76 bsa , we constrained the mixing angle between strange and non - strange @xmath77 components and appropriate width parameters by means of experimental data on the branching fractions of the decays @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "the scalar @xmath125 and vector @xmath126 form factors are then obtained for any physical time - like momentum transfer @xmath117 and no extrapolation is needed .",
    "we recall that only the vector form factor @xmath126 enters the decay amplitude @xmath127 .",
    "we deduce from the extrapolation parametrization in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath128 , which is compatible with our prediction @xmath129 @xcite within theoretical errors .",

    "( [ rf0phi ] ) , we can predict this ratio in dependence of different inputs in the @xmath96 and @xmath97 decay amplitudes . to account for the main source of uncertainty",
    ", we do so by plotting this ratio as a function of @xmath131 in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "two other sources of uncertainties are included in both figures which are due to the theoretical errors of the vector decay constant , @xmath122 , the scalar decay constant , @xmath132 , defined by @xmath133 and its relation to the vector decay constant @xmath134 . ] and the experimental error on the decay rates @xmath135  @xcite and @xmath136  @xcite .",
    "we plot the evolution of @xmath3 for a rather large window of form factor values , though the domain of interest due to the theoretical estimates @xcite is in the range @xmath137 .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig1 ] , in this particular range the central value of @xmath3 is about @xmath138 which is compatible with the estimates based on the ratio of ( differential ) decay rates , @xmath139  @xcite , depicted by the shaded area .     as a function of the transition form factor @xmath140 based on the @xmath96 and @xmath97 decay amplitudes in eqs .",

    "@xcite for @xmath141 .",
    "the area between the two dashed lines accounts for the uncertainty of the decay constants ( @xmath142 mev and @xmath143 mev ) while the solid lines include in addition the uncertainties on the decay rates @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the single dotted line is the prediction for the central values of the decay constants .",
    "the shaded area between the two dot - dashed horizontal lines represents the window of experimentally motivated estimates for @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    additional short - distance amplitudes @xmath144 , where @xmath145 denotes the helicity of the @xmath9 state , proportional to the dominant ckm term were introduced in the qcdf amplitudes for @xmath96 and @xmath97  @xcite . in a sense , these phenomenological amplitudes mock up other or beyond standard model physics contributions to the decays .",
    "in addition , we assume that whatever these other amplitudes are , they contribute equally to all helicities states of @xmath72 and to @xmath146 , as they originate in the same flavor - changing neutral current , @xmath147 , of the corresponding penguin diagrams : @xmath148 .",
    "generically , we write the amplitudes as , @xmath149 with @xmath150 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath151 are adjusted so they give the best possible agreement with experimental data on @xmath48 , which includes the branching ratio , the longitudinal , parallel and perpendicular polarization fractions , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , and two relative phases , @xmath154 and @xmath155  @xcite .",
    "they are then inserted in the @xmath96 decay amplitude .",
    "the evolution of @xmath3 including the @xmath144 amplitudes as a function of @xmath156 is presented in figure  [ fig2 ] from which it obvious that the ratio is strongly enhanced .",
    "for the same range as previously , @xmath137 , the central value of @xmath3 is of the order @xmath157 . taking into account the theoretical uncertainties this is still within an acceptable range from the estimates in the shaded area .     as in figure  [ fig1 ] but including possible new physics contributions @xmath144 in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) of ref .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    on the other hand , recent first measurements of the ratio @xmath3 , consistent with each other , seem to favor our calculation for @xmath158 and a form factor @xmath159 : @xmath160 where in each case the errors are statistical and systematic , respectively . the calculated value @xmath161",
    "@xcite actually leads to a bigger ratio , @xmath162 , which rises to @xmath163 when the @xmath144 amplitudes are included . clearly , as figure  1 instructs us , if the decays @xmath96 and @xmath97 are merely due to standard model interactions ( save for @xmath164 corrections neglected in our decay amplitudes based on qcdf ) , then @xmath165 is a more likely value for @xmath156 .",
    "if , however , these decays receive contributions from a yet unknown source then it is not plausible that they should be equal in magnitude and phase for both final states unless one admits a rather unrealistic value for @xmath166 .",
    "even if this was the case , the new physics amplitudes @xmath167 must necessarily contribute different phases to the @xmath96 and @xmath48 amplitudes which results in interferences so that @xmath3 comes close the observed values in eq .",
