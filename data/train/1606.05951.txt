    "inflation was proposed to address a series of questions , such as horizon problem , flatness problem , monopole problems and so on .",
    "moreover cosmological inflation is now getting established by all observational data such as the wmap  @xcite and planck space missions  @xcite .",
    "last year , the full - mission planck observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropies constrain the spectral index of curvature perturbations and the tensor - to - scalar ratio to be @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath3 confidence level  @xcite , respectively , which will narrow down some inflation models .    among various ways of inflation models building ,",
    "an interesting framework is embed the inflationary models into a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity , such as supergravity .",
    "however , most of the old inflation models constructed in supergravity  @xcite suffer from the @xmath4 problem  @xcite : the f - term potential is proportional to an exponent factor @xmath5 , which gives a contribution to one of the slow - roll parameter @xmath4 , and breaks the slow - roll condition .",
    "this problem can be solved by several methods  @xcite .",
    "one of the methods is to add a shift - symmetric @xmath6 to the khler potential @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "so the inflaton will not appear in the khler potential , then the exponent factor disappear and guarantee the flatness of the potential . in this case",
    ", one can get the normal chaotic inflation with a power - law potential @xmath8 .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the author extend the nambu - goldstone - like shift symmetry of chiral superfield @xmath9 to a generalized form @xmath10 , then the khler potential is a function of @xmath11 . in order to get a reasonable potential",
    ", one should consider small shift symmetry breaking terms @xmath12 in the khler potential and @xmath13 in the superpotential respectively , with @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is an extra superfield .",
    "then one can get a fraction - power scalar potential @xmath16 , the scalar spectral index @xmath17 and tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath18 can be approximate as @xmath19 , @xmath20@xcite .",
    "since the coefficient of the kinetic term in this model is field - dependent : @xmath21 , it is so called running kinetic term inflation .",
    "the inflection point inflation in the framework of mssm was for the first time realized by the gauge invariant flat directions @xmath22 or @xmath23 @xcite , and developed in @xcite . in ref.@xcite we constructed an inflection point inflationary model with a single chiral superfield , which are consistent with the planck 2015 result . and",
    "after inflation , the model has a non - susy de - sitter vacuum responsible for the recent accelerated expansion of the universe .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the possibility to construct an inflection point inflationary model with a generalized shift symmetry .",
    "we first calculate the general form of the scalar potential with polynomial superpotential in the framework of running kinetic term inflation , then focus on a polynomial superpotential of the form @xmath24 and setup the inflection point inflationary model .",
    "we study the inflationary dynamics and show that the predicted value of the scalar spectral and tensor - to - ratio are consistent with the result of planck 2015 at the @xmath3 confidence level . after the end of inflation ,",
    "the inflaton starts to oscillate around the origin , and then decays into sm particles to reheat the universe .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the next section , we give the general form of the scalar potential with polynomial superpotential . in section 3 ,",
    "we focus on the polynomial superpotential having two terms and setup the inflection point inflationary model . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss the inflationary dynamics of the model .",
    "in this section , we will calculate the scalar potential of polynomial superpotential in the framework of running kinetic term inflation model in supergravity .",
    "in such model , the khler potential satisfy the generalized shift symmetry of chiral superfield @xmath9 : @xmath25 thus it must be a function of @xmath26 : @xmath27 with coefficient @xmath28 is a number of the order of unity . during inflation",
    ", we can prove that @xmath29 is stabilized at the minimum , so the terms with @xmath30 does not change the form of the kinetic term significantly , thus we neglect them@xcite . and for @xmath31 , @xmath29 is stabilized at @xmath32 during inflation .    in order to give a successful inflation ,",
    "a small shift symmetry breaking term are necessary for the khler potential : @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "different from ref.@xcite , we assumed the superpotential to be a more general form @xcite @xmath35 here @xmath36 , and @xmath15 is an extra chiral superfield , which is assumed to be stabilized at @xmath37 by higher order terms in the khler potential .",
    "and @xmath38 with @xmath39 is the gravitino mass , which is assumed much smaller than the hubble parameter during inflation , so it can be dropped in the discussion of the inflationary dynamics .",
    "so the total khler potential are @xmath40 where the dots denote the higher order stabilized term of @xmath15 .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the scalar @xmath9 is determined by superpotential @xmath41 as well as khler potential , which is given by @xmath42 and the scalar potential of the inflaton can be calculated by @xmath43\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{0.4cm}=e^{\\kappa|\\phi|^2+c_1(\\phi^n-\\phi^{n \\dag})-\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi^n-\\phi^{n \\dag})^2}(\\sum_m\\lambda_m|\\phi|^{m})^2 , \\label{infp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the inverse of the khler metric @xmath46    for @xmath47 , the @xmath48-term can be neglected , so we can define @xmath49 , which means that @xmath50 is invariant under a nambu - goldstone like shift symmetry , and then the lagrangian ( 6 ) can be approximated by @xmath51 where we have used @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "because of the shift symmetry , the real component of @xmath50 does not appear in the khler potential , so the potential is considerably flat along the real direction and thus becomes an inflaton candidate .",
    "the imaginary component acquires a mass heavier than the hubble scale and is stabilized at the minimum during inflation .",
    "therefore , we can set @xmath54 and obtain the scalar potential of @xmath55 , which has the form @xmath56 ^ 2 . \\label{infp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in order to construct an inflection point inflationary model , we will focus on a polynomial superpotential having two terms @xmath57 with the powers @xmath58 are integer , and the coefficient @xmath59 is positive without loss of generality , @xmath60 is the phase of the second term .    using eq.(11 ) ,",
    "the scalar potential corresponding to the superpotential ( 12 ) can be written by @xmath61 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{0.4cm}=\\hat{\\lambda}_p^2\\big(\\frac{\\varphi}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big)^{\\frac{2p}{n}}\\big[1 + 2\\xi\\cos\\theta\\big(\\frac{\\varphi}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big)^{\\frac{q - p}{n } } + \\xi^2\\big(\\frac{\\varphi}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big)^{\\frac{2(q - p)}{n}}\\big ] , \\label{infp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the curve of the potential is shown in fig.1 .     with @xmath64(dash line ) , @xmath65 ( solid line ) , @xmath66 ( dot line ) , respectively.,width=384 ]    we could see that if @xmath64 , there are one minimum at @xmath67 and one minimum or zero value at @xmath68 respectively , which is shown in fig.1(dash line ) . as @xmath69 increase ,",
    "the minimum at @xmath67 is uplift . in this case , the initial value of the inflation field should below the local maximum , otherwise the inflaton will be trapped in the false vacuum .",
    "an interest case is that if the parameters @xmath60 satisfies the relation @xmath70 the local maximum and the second minimum will be the same at point @xmath71 , and the false vacuum disappears(solid line ) , this point is called inflection point . at this point , the inflation potential is @xmath72 and both the first and second derivatives of @xmath73 vanish at @xmath74 .",
    "it s worth mentioning that this potential is independent of @xmath75 , so for different @xmath75 , the potential at inflection point are almost the same . and",
    "we will see shortly that since there is a flat plateau at the inflection point @xmath74 , the predicted spectral index as well as the tensor - to - scalar ratio can lie within the @xmath0 confident region allowed by planck 2015 .",
    "when @xmath76 , then the flat plateau disappear , and power law inflation model will be reproduced(dot line ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the potential near the origin is an odd function for some choice of parameters , which will cause undesirable behavior after inflation .",
    "it does nt matter since when the scalar field @xmath77 , the first term of the kinetic term @xmath48 in ( 6 ) become important , so we could nt drop it , and the scalar @xmath9 becomes the dynamical variable .",
    "then the potential in this region is not as in fig.1 , which will have the form @xmath78 . and as @xmath9 decrease , the soft susy breaking mass term @xmath79 will dominates the potential@xcite , so the scalar will oscillate around the origin and reheat the universe .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the inflation potential with inflection point . since the parameter @xmath60 satisfy the relation(14 ) , so for a given @xmath80 and @xmath81 , there are only two free parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
