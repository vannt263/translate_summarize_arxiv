    "planets are known to be able to form in a variety of environments , some of which are believed to be hostile to their genesis . a good illustration of this statement is provided by planets detected in close binary systems , such as @xmath1 cephei ( hatzes 2003 ) .",
    "this eccentric ( @xmath7 ) , relatively small semi - major axis ( @xmath8 au ) system consists of two stars of mass @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "it harbors a giant planet with the projected mass @xmath11 in orbit with semi - major axis @xmath12 au and eccentricity @xmath13 around the primary .    several more such systems of s - type in classification of dvorak ( 1982 ) are known at present ( chauvin 2011 ; dumusque 2012 ) .",
    "two of them  hd 196885 ( correia 2008 ) and hd 41004 ( zucker 2004 ) harbor giant planets in orbits with @xmath14 au",
    ". two more  @xmath2 cen ( dumusque 2012 ) and gl 86 ( queloz 2000 ) host planets at smaller separations , @xmath15 au and @xmath16 au , correspondingly .",
    "these systems exhibit a diversity of planetary masses , with an earth - like planet ( @xmath17 ) orbiting our neighbor @xmath2 cen ( cf .",
    "hatzes 2013 ) , and other binaries hosting gas giants with @xmath18 ( chauvin 2011 ) .",
    "the existence of planets in these tight binaries has been a serious challenge for planet formation theories .",
    "the expectation of inner rather than outward planet migration due to disk - planet interaction ( ward 1986 ) suggests that such planets form in situ , at @xmath19 au ( as we show in this work it is very difficult to form them even further out ) . at these separations",
    "gravitational instability is a very unlikely avenue of planet formation ( rafikov 2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "an alternative model of core accretion ( harris 1978 ; mizuno 1980 ) relies on formation of a massive core by collisional agglomeration of a large number of planetesimals , possibly starting at small , @xmath20 km , sizes .",
    "it is this stage of planetesimal growth in tight binaries that presents significant problems to existing planet formation theories .",
    "indeed , it has been known since the work of heppenheimer ( 1978 ) that an eccentric stellar companion can drive very large planetesimal eccentricities , @xmath21 at au - scale separations .",
    "this would cause planetesimals to collide at high relative speeds of a few km s@xmath22 .",
    "as this is much higher than the escape speed from the surface of even a @xmath23 km object ( about 100 m s@xmath22 ) , collisions between planetesimals should lead to their _ destruction _ rather than growth , introducing a _ fragmentation barrier _ for planet formation ( see  [ sect : coll ] ) .",
    "the theoretical expectation of suppressed planet formation in @xmath24 au binaries has been largely corroborated by recent observations ( wang 2014 ) .",
    "the premise of our present work is that the key to solving the fragmentation barrier puzzle lies in better understanding of planetesimal dynamics .",
    "however , some alternative suggestions have also been considered over the years .",
    "for example , thbault ( 2008 , 2009 ) proposed that tight planet - hosting binaries could have started on more extended orbits , which were subsequently shrunk by interactions with other stars in their birth cluster .",
    "paardekooper & leinhardt ( 2010 ) propose a solution involving a non - standard mode of planetesimal accretion .",
    "it may also be possible that planetesimals are born big ( johansen 2007 ) , with sizes exceeding @xmath25 km , in which case they are safe from collisional destruction from the start .",
    "these possibilities would need to be invoked if we were not able to resolve the fragmentation barrier puzzle by the better treatment of planetesimal dynamics alone , underscoring the importance of this aspect of the problem .",
    "dynamics of planetesimals in binaries are complicated by a plethora of agents affecting their motion .",
    "it has been long realized that both the companion gravity and gas drag affect planetesimal motion ( marzari & scholl 2000 ; thbault 2004 ) .",
    "however , subsequently it has also been understood that these processes alone can not overcome the fragmentation barrier ( thbault 2008 ) .",
    "more recently , it was shown that the gravity of protoplanetary disk in which planetesimals reside has a dominant effect on their dynamics ( rafikov 2013b ; hereafter r13 ) .",
    "the tendency of protoplanetary disks in binaries to become eccentric further complicates this issue , see silsbee & rafikov ( 2013 ; hereafter sr13 ) .    generalizing these efforts ,",
    "rafikov & silsbee ( 2014 ; hereafter paper i ) combined different physical ingredients  gravity of an eccentric disk , perturbations due to the companion star , and gas drag  to present a unified picture of planetesimal dynamics in binaries in _ secular _ approximation .",
    "they came up with analytical solutions for planetesimal eccentricity , and explored the behavior of relative velocities between planetesimals of different sizes .",
    "our present goal is to use these dynamical results to understand planetesimal growth in tight binaries with particular focus on the fragmentation barrier issue .",
    "we couple them with recent understanding of collisional fragmentation based on the work of stewart & leinhardt ( 2009 ) and explore the conditions under which planetesimals can grow unimpeded by fragmentation in situ , i.e. at the present day orbits of planets in tight binaries .",
    "we do this for a variety of different collisional criteria governing planetesimal growth and carefully explore the space of various disk+binary parameters . to summarize our main finding from the start , we find that even in tight binaries planet formation should be possible in _ massive _ protoplanetary disks which are _ only weakly eccentric_.    this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we summarize the main dynamical results of paper i in  [ sect : dyn_sum ] .",
    "we describe our treatment of planetesimal collision outcomes in ",

    "[ sect : bin_pl_form ] .",
    "we summarize our main conclusions in  [ sect : summ ] .",
    "we study planet formation in binaries using a setup similar to sr13 and paper i. the binary with semi - major axis @xmath26 and eccentricity @xmath27 has components with masses @xmath28 ( primary ) and @xmath29 ( secondary ) .",
    "we define @xmath30 .",
    "the primary star is orbited by an eccentric protoplanetary disk , coplanar with the binary orbit .",
    "fluid elements in the disk follow elliptical trajectories with the primary star in the focus .",
    "we adopt a power law dependence of the gas eccentricity @xmath31 as a function of the semi - major axis @xmath32 of a particular ellipse : e_g(a_d)=e_0()^q .",
    "[ eq : e0 ] here @xmath33 is the outer cutoff radius of the disk .",
    "simulations show that in eccentric binaries with @xmath34 , the disk gets truncated at @xmath35 by gravitational perturbations from the companion .",
    "thus , @xmath36 is the eccentricity of fluid trajectories at the outer edge of the disk , @xmath37 .    for simplicity all fluid trajectories are assumed to have _ aligned _ apsidal lines , so that the disk orientation is uniquely defined via a single parameter @xmath38  the angle between the disk and binary apsidal lines .",
    "we let @xmath39 be the disk surface density at the periastron of the fluid trajectory with semi - major axis @xmath32 .",
    "surface density at an arbitrary point in the disk can be uniquely specified once @xmath31 and @xmath39 are known ( statler 2001 ; ogilvie 2001 ; sr13 ) . here",
    "we assume a power law dependence of @xmath40 between @xmath41 and @xmath33 .",

    "we assume a disk with @xmath33 = 5 au .",
    "planetesimals of radius @xmath52 orbit the primary within the disk and are coplanar with it and the binary .",
    "their orbits are described by semi - major axis @xmath53 , eccentricity @xmath54 and the apsidal angle ( w.r.t . the binary apsidal line ) @xmath55 .",
    "the latter two are often combined for convenience into the planetesimal eccentricity vector @xmath56 .",
    "everywhere in this work we assume @xmath57 as well as @xmath58 .",
    "in paper i we obtained a number of important results on the dynamics of planetesimals in binaries in secular approximation , i.e. neglecting short - term gravitational perturbations ( murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "our calculations simultaneously accounted for the gravity of the massive eccentric protoplanetary disk , binary companion , and gas drag .",
    "gravitational perturbations due to the binary companion and the eccentric disk excite planetesimal eccentricity at the rates determined by the eccentricity excitation terms @xmath59 due to binary and @xmath60 due to disk , given by equations ( 7,pi ) and ( 8,pi ) , correspondingly ( `` pi '' means that the referenced equation can be found in paper i ) . at the same time , the axisymmetric component of the gravity of these perturbers drives apsidal precession of planetesimal orbits at rates @xmath61 ( binary , equation ( 5,pi ) ) and @xmath62 ( disk , equation ( 6,pi ) ) .",
    "we invariably find that in disks massive enough to form jupiter mass planets , @xmath63 , planetesimal precession , and often eccentricity excitation , are dominated out to a few au by the gravity of the disk .",
    "this finding is a novel result of r13 , sr13 and paper i.    we showed that in the case of a non - precessing disk with a fixed orientation with respect to the binary apsidal line planetesimal eccentricity @xmath64 is an analytic function of the planetesimal size @xmath65 and system parameters , given by the expressions ( 22,pi)-(28,pi ) , ( 32,pi ) , & ( 33,pi ) .",
    "the latter enter equations through the two key variables  characteristic eccentricity @xmath66 and size @xmath67 , defined by equations ( 29,pi ) and ( 31,pi ) , correspondingly .",
    "dependence of @xmath66 and @xmath67 on the system parameters was explored in great detail .",
    "our analytic solutions allow us to produce maps of the relative eccentricity @xmath68 for pairs of planetesimals of different sizes @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; an example is shown in figure [ fig : coll_outcomes ] .",
    "we also derived a distribution of approach velocities for colliding planetesimals (  8 of paper i ) and shown it to be rather narrow , with the approach velocity @xmath71 constrained to lie within the range @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the local keplerian speed .",
    "thus , maps such as shown in figure [ fig : coll_outcomes ] directly characterize the typical velocity at which planetesimals collide , @xmath74 , and allow us to understand their collision outcomes , see  [ sect : coll ] .",
    "the @xmath75 and @xmath71 maps in figure [ fig : coll_outcomes ] are made for @xmath1 cephei system at @xmath76 au for the standard ( @xmath44 , @xmath49 ) aligned ( @xmath77 ) disk with @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( resulting in @xmath80 correspondingly ) .",
    "one can clearly see that planetesimals exhibit small relative eccentricity in a blue region around the diagonal line @xmath81 .",
    "this low-@xmath75 `` valley '' appears because planetesimals with similar sizes follow similar orbits , and collide with low relative speed .",
    "the valley is narrowest at @xmath82 km ( depending on @xmath66 ) , which corresponds to the characteristic size @xmath67 given by equation ( 31,pi ) . for @xmath83 planetesimals experience apsidal alignment and their relative eccentricities",
    "are lowered by gas drag . for @xmath84 , apsidal alignment",
    "is accomplished by the disk and companion gravity , again resulting in small @xmath75 . on the contrary ,",
    "planetesimals of very different sizes ( upper left and lower right regions ) are not aligned and exhibit high relative eccentricity , with @xmath85 given by equation ( 29,pi ) .",
    "we also obtained some analytical results on planetesimal eccentricity behavior in _ precessing _ disks , see  6 of paper i. we did this in two limiting cases : when binary gravity dominates over that of the disk , and vice versa .",
    "these asymptotic results are used to understand planetesimal growth in precessing disks in ",
    "[ sect : pl_prec ] .",
    "description of the dynamical behavior of planetesimals provided in paper i is used in this work to understand the outcomes of their collisions .",
    "there are different ways in which planetesimal collisional evolution can be characterized . a high - velocity collision is usually considered _ catastrophic _ when the mass of the largest surviving remnant is less than half of the combined mass of objects @xmath86 involved . in this work",
    "we use a fragmentation prescription developed by stewart & leinhardt ( 2009 ) , which suggests that a collision is catastrophically disruptive if & & > 1 , [ eq : coll_prescr ] + & & q_r= , [ eq : qr ] + & & q^*_rd= q_s r_c1 ^ 9_c/(3 - 2)v_coll^2 - 3_c +",
    "q_gr_c1 ^ 3_cv_coll^2 - 3_c , [ eq : qrstar ] where @xmath87 is the appropriately scaled kinetic energy of the collision , @xmath88 is the reduced mass of the colliding objects , and @xmath89 is the collision speed at the moment of contact .",
    "the energy threshold for catastrophic disruption @xmath90 depends on constants @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 related to the material properties of the planetesimals ; @xmath95 is the radius of a sphere with the mass @xmath96 and a density of 1 g @xmath97 . following stewart & leinhardt ( 2009 ) , we use @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 ( in proper cgs units ) for our weak planetesimals and @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath101 for strong ones .    on the other hand ,",
    "even if the condition ( [ eq : coll_prescr ] ) is not satisfied and catastrophic disruption is avoided , collisional growth is not guaranteed  it requires that the largest object ( e.g. @xmath105 ) is not _ eroded _ in a collision .",
    "erosion occurs when the largest remnant is less massive than the more massive body involved in a collision . according to stewart & leinhardt ( 2009 ) erosion happens whenever > 2 ,  m_2<m_1 .",
    "[ eq : erosion ] this condition is far more prohibitive for growth than ( [ eq : coll_prescr ] ) since @xmath106 can be much less than @xmath105 .",
    "growth in a given collision occurs only when the condition ( [ eq : erosion ] ) is violated .",
    "figure [ fig : crit_vel ] illustrates the two collisional criteria ( [ eq : coll_prescr ] ) & ( [ eq : erosion ] ) by showing the critical ( minimum ) relative planetesimal velocity @xmath89 that leads to either catastrophic destruction ( panel a ) or erosion ( panel b ) of the bodies of different sizes .",
    "various curves correspond to different size ratios and internal strengths of the objects involved in a collision .    in the case of catastrophic disruption",
    "critical @xmath89 is a sensitive function of the size ratio of objects involved .",
    "collisions of objects of similar size are clearly more destructive than those of planetesimals with very different sizes as the former are characterized by lower critical @xmath89 . for collisionally strong objects ( solid curves )",
    "we find that most destructive collisions ( requiring the lowest relative speed @xmath107 m s@xmath22 for destruction of equal mass objects ) involve @xmath108 m planetesimals , almost independent of the mass ratio . for collisionally weak objects",
    "this size is @xmath109 m and @xmath110 m s@xmath22 for @xmath111 .    in the case of erosion critical @xmath89",
    "attains minimum values roughly at the same sizes .",
    "however , the dependence on mass ratio is very weak and vanishes in the limit of @xmath112 .",
    "this follows from equation ( [ eq : qr ] ) that demonstrates that in this limit @xmath113 , canceling the dependence on @xmath106 in the right hand side of the condition ( [ eq : erosion ] ) .",
    "this difference in behaviors between the two collisional criteria has important implications as we show next .",
    "we note at this point that critical velocity curves shown in figure [ fig : crit_vel]b are likely to be not applicable for the case of erosion by very small objects . in this limit",
    "one would expect cratering and mass loss from target to be determined by its _ local _ material properties ( housen & holsapple 2009 ) , rather than global ones as suggested by the stewart & leinhardt ( 2009 ) prescription .",
    "then the critical velocity ( in the strength - dominated regime , in the absence of ejecta re - accumulation ) should become independent of the target size as the projectile - to - target size ratio tends to zero ; this is not what figure [ fig : crit_vel]b shows . to avoid this issue in the following",
    "we do not explore erosion in the limit of very large size ratio of colliding bodies , see  [ sect : erode_role ] .",
    "we now couple this understanding of different collisional outcomes with the dynamical results of paper i and proceed as follows .",
    "we compute the relative collision velocity of the two objects @xmath114 as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 , @xmath117 are the sizes of planetesimals with masses @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",
    "note that by using the maximum possible approach velocity @xmath120 for calculating @xmath114 we are being conservative , since the actual approach speed may be as small as @xmath121 , see  [ sect : dyn_sum ] .",
    "the procedure used for calculating relative eccentricity of colliding planetesimals @xmath75 in both the non - precessing and precessing disks is outlined in appendix [ eq : coll_out ] .",
    "maps of @xmath75 , @xmath122 such as the one presented in figure [ fig : coll_outcomes ] show that @xmath75 is a function of @xmath116 , @xmath117 , meaning that the same is true for @xmath114 in our approach .",
    "we can then use these maps to directly illustrate collision criteria for both strong and weak planetesimals . in figure",
    "[ fig : coll_outcomes]a the two regions inside the white boundaries stretching along the @xmath81 line represent the `` zone of destruction '' : planetesimals with sizes falling into this region get catastrophically destroyed in mutual collisions .",
    "the extent of such zone in @xmath52 is indicated with a white arrow , and the largest and smallest planetesimal sizes that get destroyed in collisions are denoted @xmath123 and @xmath124 .    in figure [",
    "fig : coll_outcomes]b black contours delineate `` zones of erosion '' : collisions of objects falling within the corresponding contour result in mass loss by the larger planetesimal , hindering growth .",
    "the extent of the erosion zone is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath125 , which is the _",
    "smallest target - to - projectile size ratio of objects that can get eroded _ in a collision for a given set of system parameters ; see figure [ fig : coll_outcomes]b for illustration of this definition .",
    "the overall morphology of the erosion zone is similar to `` erosion regions '' found by thbault ( 2008 ) in @xmath126 space using numerical integration of planetesimal orbits and fragmentation criteria different from ours , see their figures 2 , 6 , 7 .",
    "note however that our figure [ fig : coll_outcomes]b shows the erosion zone over much broader range of planetesimal sizes .",
    "both the `` islands of destruction '' in figure [ fig : coll_outcomes]a and the `` islands of erosion '' in figure [ fig : coll_outcomes]b exhibit a narrow `` channel '' between them at @xmath81 , where the growth is possible .",
    "this common feature is due to the fact that @xmath127 when @xmath69 and @xmath70 are exactly the same , because @xmath64 is a function of planetesimal size only . at the same time",
    "the general morphologies of the destruction and erosion regions are different  the former does not extend too far from the @xmath81 line because catastrophic destruction of a target planetesimal in collision of very different objects ( either @xmath128 or @xmath129 ) would require very high relative velocity , see figure [ fig : crit_vel]a . on the other hand , erosion is possible even for collisions of highly unequal objects , see figure [ fig : coll_outcomes]b , simply because the critical @xmath89 becomes independent of @xmath130 as @xmath131 .",
    "as expected , for collisionally weak objects both the destruction and the erosion zones are more extended in @xmath126 space , as shown by the dashed contours in figure [ fig : coll_outcomes ] .",
    "the extent of these zones sensitively depends on the value of the eccentricity scale @xmath66 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : coll_e_var ] where the variation of these zones with the characteristic planetesimal eccentricity @xmath66 is shown for strong planetesimals ; the rest of the parameters are as in figure [ fig : coll_outcomes ] . for high value of the disk eccentricity ( at its outer edge )",
    "@xmath132 ( panel a ) one obtains high @xmath133 , which results in very extended destruction and erosion zones .",
    "the former zone has @xmath134 , while for the latter @xmath135 .",
    "in other words , the growth - friendly channel between the two lobes of the erosion zones is extremely narrow , making planetesimal agglomeration highly unlikely in this case .",
    "lowering @xmath36 to 0.03 ( @xmath136 ) as in figure [ fig : coll_outcomes]a shrinks the size of the destruction zone , so that it presents danger for planetesimals within a size range of only about an order of magnitude , @xmath137 . reducing disk eccentricity even further as in figure [ fig : coll_e_var]b ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) we find the catastrophic destruction zone to fully disappear .    at the same time ,",
    "erosion zones tend to persist even in disks with very small eccentricity .",
    "for example , one finds @xmath140 for @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) , see figure [ fig : coll_outcomes]b .",
    "this means that planetesimals in such a disk can not erode a larger object if its mass is @xmath143 times higher .",
    "and in figure [ fig : coll_e_var]b , where the destruction zone vanishes completely , the erosion zone with @xmath144 is still present and may affect growth of planetesimals with radii @xmath145 km .",
    "we now use our understanding of the collisional outcomes described in  [ sect : coll ] to explore the possibility of planetesimal growth in binaries as a function of the two key protoplanetary disk characteristics  disk mass @xmath42 and its eccentricity at the outer edge @xmath36 ( defined by equation ( [ eq : e0 ] ) ; we fix the disk model to have @xmath44 , @xmath49 ) .    in figure [",
    "fig : aligned_maps ] we present maps of collisional outcomes for strong planetesimals in the @xmath146 space .",
    "each map uses parameters of a particular planet - hosting binary  hd196885 , @xmath1 cep , and hd 41004 ( chauvin 2011 )  selected because they host jupiter - mass planets in au - scale orbits .",
    "these maps are computed at the distance from the primary @xmath53 equal to the present - day semi - major axis of the planet ( shown on panels ) ; planet mass is indicated by the vertical red dashed line in each panel .",
    "calculations used to produce this figure assume that the disk is _ aligned _ with the binary , i.e. @xmath77 . effect of non - zero @xmath38 is explored further in  [ sect : disk_orient ] .      for each point in the two - dimensional space @xmath146 we construct the relative velocity distribution for planetesimals of different sizes as shown in figure [ fig : coll_outcomes ] . using this map of @xmath75 and",
    "the recipe provided in ",
    "[ sect : coll ] we determine whether the catastrophic destruction zone ( white contours in figures [ fig : coll_outcomes ] & [ fig : coll_e_var ] ) defined by the condition ( [ eq : coll_prescr ] ) appears in it .",
    "if it does not , then the corresponding points in @xmath146 space in figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] are colored grey .",
    "the resultant grey region in this figure covers part of the parameter space in which catastrophic collisions do not present a danger to planetesimal growth .    in the opposite case ,",
    "when the white contours appear in the @xmath75 maps , catastrophic disruption gets in the way of planetesimal growth . parts of @xmath146 phase space , in which planetesimal growth is interrupted by catastrophic collisions are not colored and lie outside the grey regions in figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] .",
    "even if catastrophic fragmentation is avoided ( i.e. outside of white region in figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] ) , planetesimal growth may still be complicated by the erosion of growing objects in numerous collisions with smaller planetesimals .",
    "to address this issue we check whether for given values of @xmath42 and @xmath36 the erosion condition ( [ eq : erosion ] ) gets satisfied for any @xmath69 , @xmath70 in a corresponding map of @xmath75 ( i.e. whether black contours such as in figures [ fig : coll_outcomes ] & [ fig : coll_e_var ] appear in the @xmath75 map ) .",
    "if it does , we need to decide how dangerous it can be for growth , which is a non - trivial issue .",
    "first , demanding erosion to be _ completely absent _ as a necessary condition for planetesimal growth is likely too conservative .",
    "first , even if some collisions are erosive , planetesimals should still be able to grow provided that the mass gain in non - erosive collisions exceeds the mass loss in erosive impacts .",
    "examination of the erosion zone shape in figures [ fig : coll_outcomes]b & [ fig : coll_e_var ] shows that a body of a given radius gets eroded predominantly by objects much smaller in size , which may be chipping off relatively small total mass even if erosive collisions are numerous . at the same time , collisions with more massive objects of comparable size result in mergers , adding substantial amount of mass and easily resulting in the net mass gain and overall growth of planetesimals . this can naturally be the case if the planetesimal size distribution is such that at all times most mass is concentrated in largest objects .",
    "the exact balance of mass loss and gain depends on the velocity and mass spectrum of colliding planetesimals .",
    "the results of paper i allow us to predict the former .",
    "however , the latter can be known only after a self - consistent calculation of planetesimal coagulation and evolution of the mass spectrum is performed .",
    "such calculation needs to use the improved dynamical inputs from paper i and requires understanding the inclination distribution of planetesimals in binaries , which is one of the key inputs for calculation of their collision rate .",
    "this calculation is beyond the scope of the present work , as our present main goal is simply to understand the general implications of the improved description of planetesimal dynamics ( paper i ) on their collisional evolution .",
    "second , recently windmark ( 2012 ) and garaud ( 2013 ) have shown that planetesimal growth can proceed even in the presence of collisional barriers .",
    "this possibility arises when the coagulation - fragmentation process is treated in a _",
    "statistical _ sense , allowing for a _ distribution of collisional outcomes_. unlike the deterministic approach that is usually employed , this way of treating planetesimal growth allows low probability events  formation of massive objects immune to collisional destruction  to occur , given a large total number of bodies in the system , through a series of  lucky \" collisions .",
    "as a result , some planetesimals can grow even though the majority get destroyed . in our case",
    "this may allow growth if some degree of erosion and even a chance of catastrophic fragmentation ( i.e. @xmath147 , see figure [ fig : coll_outcomes]a ) are present .    to account for these arguments we assume planetesimal growth to be possible in presence of _ some erosion _ , as long as it is not too significant .",
    "more specifically , we will assume that planetesimals can grow ( in a statistical sense ) if the extent of the erosion zone is limited by some _",
    "minimum _ value of the parameter @xmath125 defined in  [ sect : coll ] and figure [ fig : coll_outcomes]b . in this work",
    ", we use a fiducial value _",

    "we choose this particular value of @xmath149 simply for illustrative purposes , while in practice it should be determined based on planetesimal coagulation models ( windmark 2012 ; garaud 2013 ) .",
    "it is also low enough that we do not need to worry about the applicability of the critical velocity curves in figure [ fig : crit_vel]b in the @xmath150 limit , see the discussion in ",
    "[ sect : coll ] .",

    "we assume planetesimal growth to be possible there , despite some degree of erosion in collisions with small objects .",
    "a general conclusion that can be drawn from figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] is that , given our growth criteria , planetesimal accretion may be possible in tight binaries at the semi - major axes of the present day planets , as long as the disk mass is high and the disk eccentricity is low .",
    "growth is also possible along a narrow extension of the colored region towards higher @xmath36 and lower @xmath42 , roughly along the cyan line @xmath152 describing the equality of planetesimal excitation by the binary and the disk .",
    "the origin of this growth - friendly region is connected to the existence of the valley of stability ( see  [ sect : dyn_sum ] ) in aligned disks , which is further discussed in  [ sect : disk_orient ] .",
    "focusing on specific systems , figure [ fig : aligned_maps]c shows that in situ planetesimal growth ( i.e. at the observed semi - major axis of the planet ) is easiest in the hd 41004 system ( zucker 2004 ) .",
    "planetesimal growth in presence of some ( @xmath153 ) erosion ( black region ) is possible in this binary even for @xmath154 , as long as @xmath155 .",
    "the reason for such favorable conditions lies primarily in the relatively small semi - major axis of the planet , @xmath156 au , on which @xmath66 depends very steeply , and the low mass of the primary , @xmath157 , which lowers @xmath73 .",
    "planetesimal growth is most difficult in hd 196885 system ( correia 2008 ) , see figure [ fig : aligned_maps]a .",
    "previously , thbault ( 2011 ) realized that hd 196885 presents the most serious challenge for in situ planetesimal growth .",
    "this is mainly because of the large @xmath158 au , making planetesimal accretion with some erosion possible only in very massive disks with @xmath159 and for @xmath160 .",
    "note that at very high @xmath42 an _ evection resonance _ corresponding to commensurability @xmath161 between the planetesimal apsidal precession and the binary mean motion ( touma & wisdom 1998 ) , can appear in the disk .",
    "this would additionally disturb dynamics of planetesimals and complicate their growth ( see paper i ) .",
    "not too different is @xmath1 cephei ( figure [ fig : aligned_maps]b ) with its high @xmath12 au and @xmath162 : here planetesimal growth with @xmath153 requires @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "alternatively , growth should also be possible if disk parameters fall within the _ valley of stability _",
    "( see  [ sect : disk_orient ] ) , which can be quite wide at its lower right end .",
    "figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] reveals some additional important details .",
    "first , purple vertical lines in figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] mark the location of the _ secular resonance _ , where the planetesimal precession rate @xmath165 becomes zero , see  7.1 of paper i. at the disk mass @xmath166 corresponding to this resonance ( equation ( 49,pi ) ) the value of @xmath66 diverges in secular approximation , meaning that planetesimals collide at very high speeds resulting in their destruction .",
    "second , planet masses ( @xmath167 ) indicated by red dashed lines in figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] never fall below @xmath166 at the corresponding semi - major axis . under the natural assumption @xmath168 we can conclude that the protoplanetary disk mass @xmath42 must have exceeded @xmath166 by at least a factor of several .",
    "based on the results of sr13 and paper i , this inevitably implies that the in situ growth of planetesimal towards forming cores of gas giants should _ always proceed in either dd or db dynamical regimes _ in the classification of sr13 , i.e. when @xmath169 ( to the right from the purple line in figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] ) and _ disk gravity dominates planetesimal precession rate_. this important fact was completely overlooked prior to the work of r13 and sr13 .",
    "next we explore the sensitivity of our results to the different parameters of the calculation , such as the disk orientation (  [ sect : disk_orient ] ) , radial distribution of the gas surface density and eccentricity (  [ sect : disk_model ] ) , distance from the primary (  [ sect : disk_ecc ] ) .",
    "we focus on the @xmath1 cephei system and vary our inputs one by one .",
    "the results are then compared with figure [ fig : aligned_maps]b , allowing us to isolate the most important factors affecting planetesimal growth .",
    "we start by analyzing how planetesimal growth is affected as we vary the disk orientation with respect to the binary apsidal line , quantified via the angle @xmath38 .",
    "an important feature of the perfectly aligned disk visible in figure [ fig : aligned_maps]b is the _ `` safe zone '' _",
    "favorable for growth , which extends towards the upper left corner of the @xmath146 map .",
    "its origin lies in the presence of the dynamical _ `` valley of stability '' _ in the the @xmath146 phase space for aligned disks .",
    "this feature is easily visible in figure 4a of paper i as a narrow region , within which characteristic eccentricity @xmath66 is low . comparing with figure [ fig : aligned_maps]b",
    "we see that the shape of the growth - friendly region in @xmath146 space mirrors the overall morphology of the dynamical valley of stability .",
    "an in - depth discussion of the `` valley of stability '' properties is provided in  7.2 of paper i , where it is shown , in particular that for @xmath170 this valley stretches close to @xmath171 curve ( cyan line in figures [ fig : aligned_maps ] & [ fig_disk_orient ] ) defined by equation ( 52,pi ) , which corresponds to the equality of the planetesimal eccentricity excitation contributions provided by the disk ( @xmath60 ) and the binary companion ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this dynamical feature makes planetesimal growth possible even in low - mass disks with @xmath172 as long as the disk eccentricity @xmath36 takes on a particular value of order several per cent .",
    "the valley of stability vanishes for @xmath173 ( @xmath174 for @xmath1 cep ) because a secular resonance appears at this disk mass driving @xmath66 to very high values and making growth impossible .",
    "however , for even lower disk masses the valley of stability re - emerges , making planetesimal growth possible even in low mass disks ( @xmath175 ) but only at a certain ( narrow ) range of the disk eccentricity @xmath176 given by equation ( 54,pi ) .",
    "as the disk orientation changes away from perfect alignment , the valley of stability starts to shrink .",
    "figure [ fig_disk_orient]a shows that even relatively small misalignment of @xmath177 is enough to eliminate the growth - friendly zone for @xmath178 .",
    "planetesimal growth without _ catastrophic disruption _ is then possible only for @xmath63 , but it may still proceed at disk eccentricity @xmath179 ( upper left of the grey region ) .",
    "growth allowing for _ some erosion _ with @xmath180 requires @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( upper left of the black region ) . at the same time",
    "the overall morphology of the growth - friendly zone remains roughly the same as in the aligned case  a relatively narrow region extending towards the upper left corner of the @xmath146 parameter space .    at @xmath183 growth avoiding",
    "the catastrophic fragmentation is possible if @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "erosion with @xmath186 is not an obstacle for growth only for @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "finally , for an anti - aligned disk ( @xmath189 ) the growth avoiding catastrophic destruction is still possible for @xmath190 , @xmath191 .",
    "planetesimal growth with even modest erosion ( @xmath192 ) is certainly not possible in such a disk if its mass is below @xmath193 .",
    "these results demonstrate that both the valley of stability and the extended region favorable to planetesimal growth in figure [ fig_disk_orient ] are endemic to relatively well - aligned disks .",
    "we conclude that the maximum disk misalignment at which the valley of stability can still facilitate planetesimal growth is @xmath194 .",
    "simulation results regarding the value of @xmath38 for non - precessing disks are rather mixed .",
    "most of the simulations of mller & kley ( 2012 ) are consistent with relatively well - aligned disks and @xmath195 .",
    "this would greatly facilitate planetesimal growth in binaries . at the same time , paardekooper ( 2008 ) and marzari ( 2012 ) find @xmath196 , i.e. anti - alignment .",
    "part of the reason for the discrepancy between the different studies may lie in the method used to determine disk eccentricity ( marzari 2009 )  whether it is based on osculating orbital elements of fluid elements or on fitting the isodensity contours of the disk .",
    "thus , the numerical evidence regarding the actual value of @xmath38 is inconclusive at the moment .      in figure [",
    "fig : model_comparison ] we test the sensitivity of our results on collisional outcomes to other details of the adopted disk model .",
    "namely , we vary power law indices @xmath43 and @xmath197 characterizing @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "comparison with the middle panel of figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] shows that variations of the @xmath200 profile ( i.e. of @xmath43 ) do not induce noticeable changes .",
    "however , results are sensitive to the eccentricity profile  the model with @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) in figure [ fig : model_comparison]b yields higher disk eccentricity @xmath203 at the same semi - major axis and _ for the same _ @xmath36 than the @xmath49 model ( @xmath204 ) , see equation ( [ eq : e0 ] ) .",
    "this has detrimental effect on planetesimal growth and shrinks the size of the growth - friendly zone in the @xmath146 space .",
    "calculations shown in figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] are performed at a single location  present day semi - major axis of the planet in each system . in figures [ fig : map_in_a ] and [ fig : map_in_a_er ] we illustrate how the conditions favorable for planetesimal growth change as the distance to the star is varied .",
    "our discussion of collisional outcomes in  [ sect : coll ] shows that the detrimental effect of catastrophic collisions for planetesimal growth can be characterized by the sizes @xmath123 and @xmath124 of the largest and smallest objects that get destroyed , see figure [ fig : coll_outcomes ] for illustration .",
    "we can describe the effect of catastrophic collisions via the ratio @xmath205 , which exceeds unity whenever such collisions are possible for some planetesimal sizes .",
    "the higher is @xmath205 , the more extended is the catastrophic disruption zone and the more difficult it is for growing planetesimals to avoid being destroyed in such collisions .",
    "the white regions in maps in figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] correspond to @xmath147 , while in the grey regions catastrophic collisions are absent for any planetesimal sizes .    in figure",
    "[ fig : map_in_a ] we illustrate the sensitivity of planetesimal growth to catastrophic disruption by showing the maps of @xmath205 as a function of both the disk mass @xmath42 and the semi - major axis @xmath53 , for several values of the disk eccentricity at its outer edge @xmath36 .",
    "calculation is done for an aligned disk in @xmath1 cep system .    for a high @xmath206",
    "we see two regions favorable to growth ( i.e. the ones where @xmath205 is unity or at least less than @xmath107 ) .",
    "first , there is a thin dark blue band along the @xmath171 ( cyan ) curve , corresponding to the  valley of stability \" , see equation ( 52,pi ) .",
    "second , close to the star planetesimal dynamics is completely dominated by the disk gravity ( dd dynamical regime in classification of sr13 ) , so that @xmath207 , which is small in the inner disk ( for our @xmath49 ) .    for the lower eccentricity models shown in panels ( b ) and ( c ) , most of the dd regime ( high @xmath42 , small @xmath53 , see sr13 ) is favorable for planet formation . it may seem surprising that the @xmath208 case appears to be slightly more favorable than the @xmath209 case .",
    "this is because of the existence of the valley of stability for @xmath210 ( panel b ) , which slightly widens the growth - friendly zone in the dd regime , see  7.2 of paper i.    it is also interesting that the upper left corner of the high-@xmath36 map shown in panel ( a ) is more favorable for planetesimal growth than in maps corresponding to lower @xmath36 .",
    "this is caused by the degeneracy of the particular choice @xmath132 mentioned in  7.2 of paper i ( see equation ( 54,pi ) ) , which causes @xmath66 to be low in the corresponding region ( bb regime in classification of sr13 ) of figure 4c of paper i.    next , in figure [ fig : map_in_a ] we illustrate the sensitivity of planetesimal growth to _ erosion _ by showing the maps of @xmath211 , where @xmath125 is the lowest target - to - projectile size ratio for which erosion is possible for some planetesimal size , see   [ sect : coll ] and figure [ fig : coll_outcomes ] for details .",
    "large values of @xmath211 ( red ) correspond to the situation when erosion occurs only in collisions with very small objects , which do not result in appreciable mass removal from the target .",
    "such collisions are unlikely to prevent planetesimal growth as long as such small objects do not account for the dominant fraction of the disk mass .",
    "one can see that the behavior of @xmath211 in @xmath212 space largely replicates that of @xmath205 in figure [ fig : map_in_a ]  safe zones near the valley of stability , as well as at high @xmath42 and small @xmath53 .",
    "growth - unfriendly regions ( blue ) lie towards higher @xmath53 and at small disk masses .",
    "thus , planetesimal growth is easiest in massive disks and closer to the star .",
    "in this section we analyze planetesimal growth in disks which do not have fixed orientation with respect to the binary orbit but _ precess _ at some rate @xmath213 .",
    "we do this by following the same procedure as in  [ sect : coll ] , but calculating the relative planetesimal velocity using the results of  6 of paper i , see appendix [ eq : coll_out ] .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig : prec_disk ] where we display regions in the @xmath146 space favorable for planet formation at 2 au in @xmath1 cephei for two different values of the disk precession rate @xmath213 , expressed here in units of the local value of the planetesimal precession rate @xmath214 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath214 varies within each panel since it is a function of @xmath42 .",
    "calculations described in appendix [ eq : coll_out ] for the case of precessing disk do not provide an analytical solution for @xmath215 ( here , again , @xmath216 ) , which excludes certain parts of the @xmath146 phase space ( blue bands ) from figure [ fig : prec_disk ] . in the rest of the figure we use the results for strong (  6.1 of paper i ) and weak (  6.2 of paper i ) binary perturbation cases , depending on the circumstances .",
    "this makes our treatment of collision outcomes in precessing disk somewhat approximate .",
    "nevertheless , we can understand the main effects of disk precession on planetesimal collisional outcomes by comparing these results with figure [ fig : aligned_maps]b .",
    "first of all , the valley of stability ceases to exist because disk - secondary apsidal alignment is not possible in a precessing disk .",
    "this tends to reduce the size of the growth - friendly zone in precessing disks , even far from the center of the valley of stability .",
    "second , in the strong binary perturbation regime , below the blue band , planetesimal growth conditions are independent of @xmath213 .",
    "this is because the @xmath64 solutions obtained in  6.1 of paper i for this regime are independent of @xmath213 , since eccentricity excitation by the disk is weak .",
    "the size of the low-@xmath36 growth - friendly region varies only because the extent of the excluded region ( blue band ) depends on @xmath213    third , in the weak binary perturbation regime , above the blue band , the extent of the growth - friendly zone does depend on @xmath213 . to understand this dependence we recall ( see  6.2 of paper",
    "i ) that the overall planetesimal eccentricity scale in a precessing disk is given by @xmath217 , defined by equation ( 45,pi ) . above the blue band @xmath218 , and we can use expressions ( 6,pi ) and ( 8,pi ) for @xmath214 and @xmath219 . recalling that for our disk model with @xmath44 , @xmath49 the coefficients in these expressions are @xmath220 , @xmath221 we can write = 1.5 ( 1-)^-1 - 1 . [ eq : e_c_pr ]",
    "this ratio is equal to 0.5 in a non - precessing disk , when @xmath222 .",
    "a simple analysis of equation ( [ eq : e_c_pr ] ) then shows that @xmath223 and non - zero precession _ suppresses planetesimal eccentricity and relative velocity compared to the case of a non - precessing disk _",
    "[ eq : condit ] given that for high @xmath42 , planetesimal dynamics is in the dd regime , for non - pathological disk models ( i.e. for surface density slope @xmath224 , sr13 ) @xmath225 , i.e. planetesimal apsidal precession is _ retrograde _ relative to its mean motion .",
    "then we conclude from the condition ( [ eq : condit ] ) that _ slow ( @xmath226 ) prograde precession of the disk is favorable for planetesimal growth_. this is indeed seen at the high @xmath42 end of figure [ fig : prec_disk]a , although the magnitude of the effect is small because of the small adopted value of the @xmath227 ( see below for the characteristic value of @xmath228 ) .    on the contrary , retrograde or fast prograde ( @xmath229 ) disk precession _",
    "shrinks _ the size of the growth friendly zone , as demonstrated by figure [ fig : prec_disk]b , c for @xmath230 .",
    "this is a bit counter - intuitive as one may naively expect fast precession to result in effective azimuthal averaging of the disk potential , suppressing planetesimal eccentricity excitation by the non - axisymmetric component of the disk gravity , and lowering @xmath231 in agreement with r13 and sr13 .",
    "however , this argument loses its validity in presence of gas drag , which provides an important contribution to the value of @xmath217 .",
    "for that reason planetesimal growth is facilitated by disk precession only when the somewhat non - trivial condition ( [ eq : condit ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "for our fiducial disk with @xmath44 one finds ( r13 ) |a_d| & = & n_p= n_b^1/2 [ eq : a_d1 ] + & & 0.1 n_b , where the numerical estimate is for the @xmath1 cep parameters and @xmath232^{1/2}$ ] is the mean rate of the binary .    at the same time , simulations of disks in eccentric binaries tend to find a variety of outcomes depending on the detailed physics that goes into the calculations , with both prograde ( okazaki 2002 ; marzari 2009 ) and retrograde ( kley & nelson 2008 ; mller & kley 2012 ) precession possible .",
    "numerical results suggest that typically @xmath233 ( marzari 2009 ; mller & kley 2012 ) , which is considerably slower than @xmath234 evaluated at the semi - major axis of the planet , @xmath235 . in this case , according to figure [ fig : prec_disk]a , even if precession is prograde its effect on planetesimal growth in high - mass disks is going to be small ( or slightly negative mainly through the elimination of the valley of stability in precessing disks ) .    lower mass disks ( @xmath236 ) , containing enough mass to form only terrestrial or neptune - like planets have lower @xmath237 .",
    "if they precess at the slow rates found in simulations they may have @xmath238 satisfied .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig : prec_disk ] , planetesimal growth is strongly suppressed in such low - mass disks .",
    "thus , planetesimal growth in low - mass precessing disks must be rather difficult , at least at separations @xmath239 au .",
    "this is contrary to the non - precessing aligned disk case , in which the existence of the valley of stability permits collisional growth even for @xmath240 , see  [ sect : pl_form ] and figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] .",
    "it is also worth noting that simulations with improved treatment of the gas thermodynamics ( marzari 2012 ; mller & kley 2012 ) and including self - gravity ( marzari 2009 ) tend to produce _ non - precessing _",
    "disks , properties of which we explored in previous section .",
    "thus , disk precession is unlikely to strongly affect our conclusions regarding planetesimal growth in s - type binaries .",
    "apart from the eccentricity evolution , the non - conservative gas drag causes inspiral of planetesimal orbits  an effect that was not accounted for in sr13 .",
    "we now turn our attention to this important issue .",
    "calculation of the radial drift @xmath241 is a more delicate procedure than that of the eccentricity damping . as shown by adachi ( 1976 ) , even in the case of a circular disk one has to account for the radial variation of the gas density @xmath242 when computing @xmath241 .",
    "calculation becomes even more complicated in the case of an eccentric disk with its non - axisymmetric surface density profile .",
    "accounting for the difference in azimuthal velocities of gas and particles that results from the radial pressure gradient can be highly non - trivial in the case of an eccentric disk .",
    "for that reason , we have chosen to describe radial planetesimal drift @xmath241 using an empirical generalization of the appropriate results of adachi ( 1976 ) for the case of an eccentric disk .",
    "this generalization is physically motivated and reduces to the known results in the case of the circular disk with @xmath243 .",
    "namely , we use the equation ( 4.21 ) of adachi ( 1976 ) , in which we simply set @xmath244 and replace @xmath245 with the relative particle - gas eccentricity @xmath246 . as a result , we find a_p=- ( e_r^2+^2)^1/2 , [ eq : rad_drift ] where _ a & = & e_r_d = d^-1 [ eq : tau_a ] + & & 6  c_d^-1 d_p,1 .",

    "the different parameters entering these expressions are the logarithmic slopes of the gas density and temperature @xmath248 and @xmath249 , related via @xmath250 , see equation ( [ eq : sig_0 ] ) .    in this work",
    "we will use power - law temperature profile @xmath251 , with @xmath252 being the gas temperature at 1 au , so that 410 ^ -2 ( ) ^1/2 ( ) ^(1-s)/2 .",
    "[ eq : h / r ] in our calculations we normally take @xmath253 and @xmath254 k ( the central stars of compact planet - hosting binaries are usually somewhat more massive than the sun ) .    note that the characteristic timescale of the radial drift in the case @xmath255 is @xmath256 , which is much longer than the eccentricity damping time @xmath247 . for smaller @xmath246 migration time lengthens even further .",
    "the slowness of the radial drift allows us to treat @xmath53 as a constant while following the evolution of planetesimal eccentricities .",
    "radial drift depends steeply on @xmath246 and can be rather fast for strongly dynamically excited planetesimals . because of the radial pressure support in the gaseous disk resulting in the non - zero value of @xmath257 , @xmath241 does not completely vanish even as @xmath258 .",
    "this is not the case for eccentricity evolution  eccentricity damping naturally vanishes for @xmath259 .    in figure [ fig : t_mig ] we map the migration time @xmath260 in @xmath42-@xmath53 coordinates .",
    "we calculate @xmath261 using equations ( [ eq : rad_drift])-([eq : h / r ] ) for our standard ( aligned ) disk parameters in @xmath1 cephei for two different values of the disk eccentricity and planetesimal size .",
    "these maps clearly show many non - trivial features and significant variation as we change @xmath36 and @xmath52 .",
    "to better understand them we overplot the lines of @xmath262 ( purple ) and @xmath171 ( cyan ) conditions .",
    "interestingly , no significant feature is seen in the @xmath261 maps at the location of the @xmath262 secular resonance .",

    "existence of a localized peak of @xmath261 has important implications for planetesimal growth . in a disk with fixed values of @xmath36 and @xmath42 , planetesimals in the outer parts of the disk",
    "migrate inward until they reach the high-@xmath261 valley . in a narrow range of semi - major axes corresponding to this valley",
    "their radial drift significantly slows down resulting in the local increase of the surface density of solids of different sizes .",
    "given the dramatic local increase of @xmath261 one can expect planetesimal density there to exceed its initial local value by orders of magnitude .",
    "moreover , according to figure 4 of paper i , the high-@xmath261 valley is also the location where @xmath66 becomes very small providing favorable conditions for planetesimal growth .",
    "these points are further discussed in  [ sect : bin_pl_form ] .",
    "now we apply our understanding of planetesimal growth and migration described in previous sections to clarify the circumstances under which planets of different masses can form in disks within binaries .",
    "presence of planets with @xmath167 of order several @xmath6 inevitably implies that their parent protoplanetary disks must have been massive , @xmath63 : disk mass can not be much lower than at least several @xmath6 , otherwise disk simply would not contain enough gas to form these massive objects .",
    "this argument must hold even despite the observational evidence against massive disks in small separation binaries coming from sub - mm observations ( harris 2012 ) .",
    "planet masses indicated by the vertical red lines in figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] are no more than an order of magnitude lower than @xmath42 at the edge of the ( grey ) growth - friendly zone for @xmath272 .",
    "then , under the natural constraint @xmath63 , figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] clearly implies that unimpeded planetesimal growth leading to giant planet formation at au - scale separations in binaries is _ possible provided that disk eccentricity is low _ , @xmath273 .",
    "this is an important requirement for giant planet formation in small separation ( @xmath274 au ) binaries , which is inspired by planetesimal dynamics alone .",
    "it represents one of the key results of this work .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have direct measurements of circumstellar disk eccentricities in young stellar binaries and can not address the @xmath275 constraint directly .",
    "simulations of disks in eccentric binaries with @xmath34 tend to find rather low values of @xmath276 ( marzari 2009 , 2012 ; mller & kley 2012 ; picogna & marzari 2013 ) .",
    "in fact , regly ( 2013 ) claim that for @xmath277 protoplanetary disk does not develop permanent eccentricity in their simulations and deviations from axisymmetry are minimal .",
    "this is in contrast to simulations of disks in circular ( or low-@xmath27 ) binaries , which often demonstrate high @xmath278 ( kley 2008 ; regly 2011 ) .",
    "such dychotomy is likely caused by the smaller truncation radii of the disks in high-@xmath27 binaries ( regly 2011 ) reducing companion perturbation on them .",
    "disks in circular binaries can extend further out , potentially creating conditions for the disk eccentricity excitation via the lubow ( 1991 ) mechanism .",
    "based on this we conclude that the existing numerical results _ are roughly compatible _ with the conditions needed for overcoming the fragmentation barrier and forming giant planets within massive disks ( @xmath63 ) in au - scale orbits , namely , low @xmath36 of order several per cent , see figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] .",
    "note that in very massive disks ( @xmath163 ) this conclusion holds for arbitrary disk orientation as well as in precessing disks , see figures [ fig_disk_orient ] and [ fig : prec_disk ]",
    ".    even in high-@xmath42 disks presence of the valley of stability facilitates planet formation .",
    "figure [ fig : t_mig]a , b shows that in low-@xmath36 , high-@xmath42 systems the region of long migration time @xmath261 corresponds to semi - major axis of @xmath279 au .",
    "this means that planetesimals would _ preferentially accumulate _ at these locations in massive disks by gas - driven radial migration .",
    "corresponding increase of the surface density of solids , combined with the lowered relative velocities of planetesimals at the same locations ( see figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] ) , could considerably facilitate growth of planetary cores .",
    "interestingly , three out of five presently known planet - hosting tight binaries have planets at @xmath280 au , and all three are massive giants with @xmath281 ( chauvin 2011 ) . we suggest that this may be not a coincidence but , possibly , the evidence for in - situ formation of these giants , facilitated by the local pile up of solids , in low - eccentricity ( @xmath155 ) , high mass ( @xmath63 ) disks , which were aligned ( @xmath268 ) with the orbits of their binary companions .",
    "we also speculate that the observed clustering of the binary eccentricity in @xmath1 cep - like systems ( with @xmath274 au ) around @xmath282 ( chauvin 2011 ; dumusque 2012 ) is directly linked to lower disk eccentricities @xmath203 in them , as suggested by simulations ( regly 2011 ) .",
    "these makes such eccentric binaries _ more favorable _ for overcoming fragmentation barrier and forming planets than their circular counterparts . and in highly eccentric systems , @xmath283 , disks would be truncated at the radii too small to contain enough mass for planet formation .",
    "thus , the apparent clustering of @xmath27 of compact ( @xmath274 au ) planet - hosting binaries around @xmath284 may be not coincidental .",
    "formation of terrestrial ( like in @xmath2 cen system , dumusque 2012 ) or neptune - size planets may also proceed in massive disks , in which case the conclusions of  [ sect : giant_good ] would apply directly . at the same time , just based on the mass budget , low - mass planets might also be expected to form in lower mass ( @xmath236 ) disks .",
    "sub - mm observations suggest that such disks are more abundant than their more massive counterparts in binaries with separations of order several tens of au ( harris 2012 ) . however , satisfying the planetesimal growth constraints formulated in ",
    "[ sect : giant_good ] for low @xmath42 becomes problematic , as can be inferred from the presence of extended growth - unfriendly ( white ) zones at small @xmath42 in figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] . according to figures [ fig_disk_orient ] and [ fig : prec_disk ] planetesimal growth is essentially impossible in low-@xmath42 disks which are mis - aligned with the binary orbit or precess .",
    "however , in aligned disks low - mass planet formation may still be possible even for @xmath240 . in such disks the valley of stability ( see figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] ) provides the conditions favorable for planet formation even for @xmath240 and for relatively high @xmath285 . moreover",
    ", disk evolution may naturally drive even high-@xmath42 systems towards the valley of stability at a given semi - major axis . indeed , even if the disk starts at relatively high @xmath285 and high @xmath286 , above the black region in figure [ fig : aligned_maps ] , over time its viscous evolutions will reduce @xmath42 and ultimately bring the disk into the valley of stability , making low - mass planet formation quite natural at this point .    within the localized regions corresponding to the valley of stability",
    "one would again have a combination of both the increased density of solids due to planetesimal accumulation induced by the non - uniform planetesimal drift and the suppression of relative planetesimal velocities .",
    "both factors promote planetesimal growth .",
    "figures [ fig : map_in_a ] & [ fig : t_mig ] clearly show that in low mass disks @xmath287 with relatively high eccentricities @xmath285 such low-@xmath66 and high-@xmath261 regions lie at semi - major axes of 1 - 2 au . earth or neptune - like planets may form there",
    ".    finally , unimpeded planetesimal growth within relatively low mass disks , @xmath175 , may also be possible close to the star , at sub - au separations , provided that the disk has low eccentricity , @xmath273 .",
    "this is seen in figure [ fig : map_in_a ] & [ fig : map_in_a_er ] , which demonstrate small @xmath205 and relatively large @xmath211 at small @xmath53 .",
    "such mode of planet formation may have been responsible for the origin of the earth - mass planet in @xmath2 cen b ( dumusque 2012 ) .",
    "our finding that fragmentation barrier can be overcome , opening a way to planet formation at separations of several au in tight binaries such as @xmath1 cep and @xmath2 cen is opposite to the conclusions of many previous studies ( thbault 2008,2009 ; thbault 2011 ) .",
    "the main reason for this difference is in the role of ( generally non - axisymmetric ) protoplanetary disk gravity , which we account for in secular approximation , while other studies included only gas drag and perturbations from the companion .",
    "as we showed in paper i and in this work this aspect really makes a big difference for the outcome  in disks massive enough to form giant planets , planetesimal precession and eccentricity excitation become dominated by the gravity of the disk rather than of the companion .",
    "thus , it is very important that future studies of planet formation in binaries , including those that self - consistently evolve the disk using direct hydrodynamical simulations , account for the gravitational effect of the disk on planetesimal motion .",
    "this has been previously done in kley & nelson ( 2007 ) and fragner ( 2011 ) but the complexity of planetesimal dynamics including disk gravity has not been explored in sufficient detail in these studies .",
    "on the other hand , some other previous studies have found planetesimal growth in tight binaries to be possible .",
    "marzari & scholl ( 2000 ) arrived at this conclusion by noticing the apsidal phasing of planetesimal orbits by gas drag . but later thbault ( 2008 ) showed the associated reduction of the relative speed @xmath71 to be a consequence of a single planetesimal size approximation .",
    "thbault ( 2006 ) find growth possible for almost circular binaries with small @xmath27 , since in this case eccentricity forcing by the companion vanishes .",
    "however , simulations show that disks tend to develop large eccentricities ( @xmath288 ) in systems with low @xmath27 ( e.g. marzari 2009,2012 ; regly 2011 ) , which , with disk gravity included , would have likely resulted in severe difficulty of forming planets .",
    "we explored planetesimal growth in au - scale orbits within small - separation ( @xmath274 au ) binaries using a newly developed secular description of planetesimal dynamics ( paper i ) , which includes a number of important physical ingredients relevant for this problem  perturbations due to the companion , gas drag , and , most crucially , gravitational effects of an eccentric disk .",
    "we used our results to assess the possibility of planet formation in binaries and arrived at the following conclusions .",
    "* by exploring outcomes of pair - wise planetesimal collisions we identified ranges of planetesimal sizes for which growth by coagulation is suppressed (  [ sect : coll ] ) .",
    "inclusion of disk gravity is very important for properly determining the extent of accretion - unfriendly zones .",
    "* planetesimal growth uninhibited by fragmentation is possible for a broader range of parameters ( @xmath42 and @xmath36 ) in disks , which are _ apsidally aligned _ with the binary orbit (  [ sect : disk_orient ] ) . *",
    "radial drift of planetesimals caused by gas drag is highly non - uniform in aligned disks , with the drift timescale sharply peaking at au - scale separations .",
    "this causes accumulation of planetesimals at the location where their dynamical excitation is weak and provides favorable conditions for their growth (  [ sect : pl_migr ] ) . *",
    "formation of giant planets in observed ( au - scale ) configurations in eccentric binaries like @xmath1 cep is possible in massive and not very eccentric disks , @xmath63 and @xmath155 (  [ sect : giant_good ] ) .",
    "the former condition is consistent with the very existence of massive ( several @xmath289 ) planets in these systems .",
    "the latter is in rough agreement with the results of simulations , revealing low disk eccentricity in eccentric ( @xmath290 ) binaries .",
    "planet formation may be inhibited in circular binaries as simulations show disks to develop high eccentricity in such systems . *",
    "terrestrial and neptune - like planets can form in massive disks just as giant planets can .",
    "their genesis in the low - mass ( @xmath240 ) disks is possible close to the star ( @xmath291 au ) but is generally suppressed further out , at @xmath292 au .",
    "however , if the disk and binary periapses are aligned , low mass planets can also form in low-@xmath42 disks at certain locations ( even at @xmath293 au ) where the radially migrating planetesimals ( 1 ) accumulate and ( 2 ) have low relative velocities , promoting their growth in mutual collisions .",
    "our results provide a natural way of explaining the existence of planets in small separation binaries , such as @xmath1 cep and @xmath2 cen , via the improved understanding of planetesimal dynamics .",
    "this may eliminate the need to invoke more exotic scenarios for forming such systems .",
    "our calculations assessed the possibility of planetesimal growth by exploring just the two possible collision outcomes  catastrophic disruption and erosion by objects of certain sizes .",
    "the full understanding of planetesimal growth in binaries will require a self - consistent coagulation simulation that would evolve the mass spectrum of objects fully accounting for the complexity of their dynamics in binaries .",
