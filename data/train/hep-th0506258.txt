    "quantum field theory at finite temperature was motivated by the increasing interest in studying the properties of matter under extreme conditions as , for example , at very high temperature or density .",
    "the pioneering works joining together the statistical and quantum field theory were developed mainly by matsubara @xcite in a non relativistic context and , the relativistic case by fradkin @xcite who , via the functional approach , studied the different methods for calculating the thermal green s functions as well as the structure of the ward identities in qed@xmath0 . later other works within the thermal field theory appeared @xcite whose principal interest was to explore the possibility of restoring some broken symmetries that occur at zero temperature , as for example the @xmath1 symmetry of weak interaction .",
    "the finite temperature gauge theories and the problems concerning to the choice of a physical gauge and its dependence was analyzed by bernard @xcite , in particular , the free electromagnetic field .",
    "on the other hand , at zero temperature , there is an alternative way to study the properties for the electromagnetic field which is known as the massless duffin - kemmer - petiau ( dkp ) theory @xcite that is not a trivial limit of the massive duffin - kemmer - petiau theory ( dkp ) @xcite that appears as an alternative formalism for the description of the spin 0 and spin 1 particles in a unified formulation .",
    "the dkp theory gives a first order linear equation and it is very similar to the dirac one but the @xmath2 matrices satisfy a different algebraic relation .",
    "the massive and massless case of the theory were considered in the works minkowski , riemann , r - cartan where the equivalence of the dkp theory with the theories like klein - gordon - fock ( kgf ) and maxwell was proved in minkokwski space - time @xcite and studied in curved space - time such as riemann @xcite and riemann - cartan @xcite .    at finite temperature",
    "the massive case is treated in the work @xcite where the bose - einstein condensation is investigated in the spin 0 sector .",
    "the equivalence of many - photons thermal green s functions of the dkp and kgf theories was also proved for the scalar sector @xcite calculating the polarization operator at 1-loop order and , in @xcite is shown the equivalence of many - gluons green s functions in the dkp and kgf statistical quantum field theories    as above mentioned , all accomplished studies on the massless dkp theory were made at zero temperature .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the thermodynamics of the electromagnetic field by using the massless dkp theory .",
    "the paper is organized as following : in section 2 , we give a brief review of the massless dkp formalism considering a theory with only one real dkp field . in section 3",
    ", the constraint analysis is performed for the dkp theory and it has been shown that the model has two first class constraints . in section 4 , we calculate the partition function and , finally , we give our conclusions and commentaries .",
    "the massless dkp theory is described in minkowski space - time by the following lagrangian density @xcite @xmath3where @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 are singular square matrices satisfying the following algebra @xmath8@xmath9due to the singular character of the @xmath6 matrices the transition of the massive case to the massless theory is non trivial and demands a different treatment . on the other hand",
    "the representations of the dkp algebra are reducible and contain the sectors of spin 0 and spin 1 in their structure .    from the lagrangian ( [ d1 ] ) we obtain the equation of motion for the massless dkp field @xmath10it",
    "can be shown that the lagrangian ( [ d1 ] ) and the massless dkp equation remain invariants under the following gauge transformation @xmath11iff the field @xmath12 satisfies the condition @xmath13    when the fields under consideration are no charged we have a real dkp field matrices must been satisfied @xmath14 .  the representation of the @xmath6 matrices for the spin 1 sector is given in the appendix a , where we also included the @xmath7 matrix . ]",
    "@xmath15 , in such situation the lagrangian ( [ d1 ] ) takes the following form @xmath16",
    "we proceed the study of the constraint analysis to the real massless dkp theory from the lagrangian ( [ d8 ] ) which is written as @xmath17as usual we define the canonical momentum @xmath18 as @xmath19from which a set of primary constraints appear @xmath20@xmath21because the two different representations for the @xmath6 matrices we have for the spin @xmath22 sector that @xmath23 and for spin @xmath24 sector that @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian density @xmath27 that follows from the lagrangian ( [ c1 ] ) is given by @xmath28and considering the set of constraints ( [ c3 ] ) we have the primary hamiltonian density @xmath29as @xmath30where @xmath31 are the lagrange multiplier .",
    "the poisson bracket ( pb ) for the primary constraints results in @xmath32to investigate the possibility of obtaining more constraints in the theory we apply the preservation in time of @xmath33 i.e. @xmath34where @xmath35 is the primary hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the stability condition provide @xmath36being @xmath6 singular matrices we conclude that not all @xmath37coefficients can be obtained from the relation ( [ c8 ] ) and more constraints appear .",
    "these new constraints are selected by means of the projector @xmath38 , thus , we obtain @xmath39that are a set of secondary constrains .",
    "when the preservation in time of these secondary constraints is imposed no more constraints appear in the theory .",
