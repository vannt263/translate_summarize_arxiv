    "the pibeta collaboration has proposed an experimental program  @xcite with the aim of making a precise determination of the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 decay rate at the paul scherrer institute ( psi ) .",
    "the proposed technique is designed to achieve an overall level of accuracy in the range of @xmath70.5@xmath4% , improving thus on the present branching ratio uncertainty of 4@xmath4%  @xcite .",
    "the ( 1.025@xmath60.034)@xmath8@xmath9 pion beta decay ( @xmath10 ) branching ratio will be remeasured relative to the @xmath11 times more probable @xmath0@xmath1@xmath12 decay rate , that is known with the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty of @xmath70.40@xmath4%  @xcite .",
    "the standard model description of the @xmath10 decay and its radiative corrections  @xcite enables a stringent test of the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis and the unitarity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix .",
    "the most accurate extraction of the ckm matrix element @xmath13 , based on the superallowed fermi transitions in nuclei , involves the theoretical nuclear overlap corrections that dominate the 0.3@xmath4% total uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of nine different nuclear transition rates confirm the cvc hypothesis at the level of 4@xmath8@xmath14 , but violate the three - generation ckm unitarity condition by more than twice the estimated error  @xcite .",
    "complementary neutron decay experiments yield a result that also differs from unitarity by over two standard deviations , but in the opposite sense  @xcite .",
    "it is of fundamental interest to measure the branching ratio of the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 decay at the 0.5@xmath4% level or better to check the consistency with the nuclear and neutron @xmath15 decay values and the unitary prediction of the minimal standard model ( msm ) .",
    "moreover , the precisely measured @xmath10 branching ratio could be used to constrain masses and couplings of additional neutral gauge bosons in grand unified theories .",
    "if such couplings are directly discovered at future collider experiments , precision low - energy data will be an essential ingredient in extending the msm framework  @xcite .",
    "the central part of the pibeta detector system is a high - resolution , highly segmented fast shower calorimeter surrounding the active stopping target in a near - spherical geometry .",
    "the requirements imposed on the calorimeter design were :    * high energy resolution for effective suppression of background processes ; * high segmentation and fast timing response to handle the high event rates ; * acceptable radiation , mechanical and chemical resistance ; * compact geometry to simplify the operation and reduce the cost .",
    "these design constraints are met in a spherical detector with individual calorimeter modules made from undoped cesium iodide ( csi ) crystals .",

    "after physical measurements crystal surfaces were polished with a mixture of 0.2 @xmath25 m aluminum oxide powder and etylenglycol . next came a measurement of the light output of the fast csi scintillation component ( f ) that is completely decaying in the first 100 ns , relative to the total csi signal ( t ) , integrated in a 1 @xmath25s adc gate .",
    "these measurements were made with unwrapped crystals using air - gap coupled photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) and a tektronix tds 744 digital oscilloscope .",
    "only the crystals with a fast - to - total component ratio ( f / t ) better than 0.7 were accepted .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the maximum fast - to - total ratio was always achieved with unwrapped crystals because all applied wrapping materials absorb more ultraviolet light which dominates the fast component , than visible light .",

    "signals from both ends of the delay line were amplified twenty - fold , discriminated at a threshold of 10 mv and connected to two channels of a time - to - digital converter ( lcr 2229a tdc ) .",
    "the time difference in the two tdc readings identified the fired anode wire .",
    "cathode lines defining the alternate field  @xcite were connected to one `` odd '' ( o ) and one `` even '' ( e ) line , and the signals on these lines were processed by a custom - made electronics unit which added and subtracted the analog pulses  @xcite .",

    "limiting the adc sums to the nearest - neighbor crystals ( six or seven crystal clusters ) the fractional fwhm@xmath130 energy resolution could be parameterized by : @xmath135 for the positrons with the detected peak energy @xmath132 mev and @xmath136 for the monoenergetic photons with the detected peak energy @xmath134 mev ( fig .",

    "the veto shielding cuts decreased both fractions by about 0.3@xmath4% .",

    "the detector response to positrons and photons in the energy range between 10@xmath4mev and 120@xmath4mev is also nonlinear because the volume distribution of the shower energy deposition depends on the incident particle type and the energy .",

    "the corresponding geant simulation of the nonuniform pibeta apparatus for 68.9@xmath4mev @xmath126 and 70.8@xmath4mev @xmath23 s shows that both energy responses will be broadened to the average fwhm@xmath129 of 5.9@xmath4% and 6.9@xmath4% while the associated tail contributions will change only for photon spectra , increasing the low - energy tail by @xmath70.3@xmath4% .",
