    "in extending a result of hayman and pommerenke  @xcite and giving a characterization of analytic functions mapping the unit disk into a given planar domain @xmath7 , stegenga  @xcite came across a dichotomy property of the logarithmic capacity , namely that if @xmath8 is the complement of a planar domain , then its logarithmic capacity density with respect to a radius @xmath9 either tends to @xmath10 or to @xmath3 as @xmath11 .",
    "the property that the complement of @xmath7 has its logarithmic capacity density tending to @xmath3 at global scales characterizes the property that analytic functions from the unit disk to @xmath7 belong to the class @xmath12 .    in @xcite the first author ,",
    "together with itoh , studied such a dichotomy property of the global capacity density for the variational @xmath5-capacity , @xmath13 , in weighted euclidean spaces . in this note",
    "we investigate the same problem in the nonsmooth setting of metric measure spaces , where it is considerably more complicated and subtle .",
    "it turns out that the dichotomy fails in general , and that the shape of balls plays a significant role .",
    "fix @xmath13 and let @xmath14 be an unbounded complete metric measure space with a doubling measure @xmath15 supporting a @xmath5-poincar inequality .",
    "it is known that such a metric space is @xmath16-quasiconvex for some @xmath17 , i.e. , for all @xmath18 , there exists a rectifiable curve @xmath19 connecting @xmath20 and @xmath21 with length @xmath22 .",

    "@xmath23 by @xmath24 where the infimum is taken over all rectifiable curves @xmath19 connecting @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "it follows from the @xmath16-quasiconvexity that @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , arc length with respect to the given distance @xmath26 and with respect to the inner metric @xmath23 are the same , and thus @xmath27 is a geodesic space ( i.e. , @xmath3-quasiconvex ) with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "now let @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we study the following global lower capacity densities @xmath30 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the ordinary and inner balls , respectively , and @xmath33 is the variational capacity ( see ) .",
    "it is easy to see that , as @xmath11 , the limit of @xmath34 and that of @xmath35 are comparable ( see lemma  [ lem : dens = densin ] ) .",
    "however , they have different nature .",
    "we show that @xmath35 has the same dichotomy as in the euclidean case found in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary  1.5 ) , whereas @xmath34 does not have such a dichotomy in general .",
    "more precisely , we have the following two theorems .",

    "[ ref - i ] @xmath36 , 2 .",
    "@xmath37 .",

    "although by the quasiconvexity of @xmath27 , an ordinary ball @xmath42 and an inner ball @xmath43 satisfy @xmath44 and thus are comparable , the ordinary balls may be oddly shaped .",
    "this illustrates the difference between theorems  [ thm : main ] and  [ thm : nodicho ] .",
    "as was observed in @xcite , uniform approximation of capacity from inside plays an important role for the dichotomy of the global capacity density .",
    "such an approximation property can be verified for domains satisfying an interior corkscrew condition , see section  [ sec : aci ] for details . to further understand this phenomenon",
    "we introduce the notion of capacitarily stable collections of sets in section  [ sect - cap - stable ] and show that the dichotomy holds for such collections .",
    "we also give examples of capacitarily stable collections , including one consisting of john domains .",

    "@xmath38 , 2 .",
    "@xmath49 .    furthermore , the two possibilities listed above are independent of @xmath29 , with the exception that the constant @xmath50 depends on @xmath47",
    ".    one may ask if there can be a similar dichotomy for other capacities as well . in @xcite",
    "the first author observed that the riesz capacity of order @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) in the euclidean space has the same dichotomy property . on the other hand ,",
    "we show in example  [ exa : cp ] that the sobolev capacity @xmath53 has neither dichotomy nor weak dichotomy even in the linear case @xmath54 on unweighted @xmath6",

    "we recall some basic estimates for the variational capacity and use them to deduce comparison results for the capacity density functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in section  [ sect - superlevel ]",
    "we deduce an identity for the capacity of superlevel sets for the capacitary potentials .",
    "similar estimates have earlier been obtained in @xcite , but here we obtain an exact identity .    in the subsequent two sections , we give the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] , through the use of a number of simpler lemmas . also theorem  [ thm : main - weak ] is obtained therein . in section  [ sect - counterex ]",
    "we give the key counterexample yielding theorem  [ thm : nodicho ] , and another counterexample showing that there is no dichotomy for the sobolev capacity .",
    "finally , in the last section we define capacitarily stable collections , show that they satisfy a dichotomy , and give examples of such families , including families of john domains and families of domains satisfying the interior corkscrew condition .",
