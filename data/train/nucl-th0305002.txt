    "the photoproduction of light vector meson ( @xmath4 ) is an interesting reaction for many reasons . at high energies ( @xmath5 gev ) it brings information on the dynamics of the pomeron exchange  @xcite . at low energies ( @xmath6 gev ) , its observables are sensitive to the resonance channel and",
    "can be used to obtain some unique information about the structure of baryon resonances , properties of @xmath7-interactions  @xcite , and possible manifestation of the so - called `` missing resonances ''  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of vector - meson photoproductions is an important component of the experimental programs at the electron and photon facilities like thomas jefferson national accelerator facility , the leps at spring-8 .",
    "elsa - saphir at bonn and graal at grenoble .",
    "the @xmath0-meson photoproduction at relatively low energies @xmath8 gev plays particularly important role .",
    "it is expected that in the diffractive region , the dominant contribution comes from the pomeron exchange , since trajectories associated with conventional meson exchanges are suppressed by the ozi - rule .",
    "the exception is the finite contribution of the pseudoscalar @xmath9,@xmath10-meson - exchange channel , but its properties are quite well understood  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the low - energy @xmath0-meson photoproduction may be used for studying the presence of additional trajectories .",
    "candidates are trajectories associated with a scalar meson  @xcite and @xmath11-meson  @xcite containing a large amount of strangeness , glueball  @xcite or other exotic channels  @xcite . but",
    "the relative contributions of these additional processes can not be well defined within regge phenomenology and must be determined from comparisons with experimental data .",
    "spin observables are of crucial importance for such studies . as a matter of fact",
    ", the pomeron exchange amplitude which is inspired by multi - gluon exchange  @xcite contains specific spin - dependence terms which are negligible in @xmath0-meson photoproduction at high energies but become important at a few gev .",
    "these interactions lead to spin - flip processes and give non - trivial behaviour of the spin - density matrix elements even at forward angles .",
    "therefore , the angular distribution of @xmath1 decay can be used as a tool to study the diffractive mechanism , and is complementary to the measurement of unpolarized cross section .",
    "another subject is related to the strange degrees of freedom in a nucleon .",
    "analysis of magnetic  @xcite and electroweak  @xcite moments of baryons show that the @xmath0-meson couples more strongly to the nucleon than expected on the basis of the ozi - rule  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the strange - quark content in the nucleon was indicated by measurements of the @xmath9-nucleon term  @xcite , @xmath0-meson production in proton annihilation at rest  @xcite and deep - inelastic electroweak lepton - nucleon scattering ( see ref .",

    "the backward - angle photoproduction is dominated by @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels of the nucleon and resonant amplitudes and directly related to the strength of @xmath14 and @xmath3-interactions .",
    "the finite - strange content leads to an increase of this strength compared to the expectation based on the standard ozi - rule violation ( ozi - rule - evading interaction  @xcite ) .",
    "this effect must be seen in both unpolarized and spin observables at large momentum transfers .    at forward angles ,",
    "the nucleon and resonant contributions become negligible for @xmath0-meson photoproduction and ozi - rule violation could appear as direct @xmath15-knockout  @xcite from a nucleon .",
