    "the hole - doped antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath0 two - leg ladder is used as a model system , theoretically as well as experimentally , for the two - dimensional cuprate superconductors .",
    "because the spin ladder is quasi one - dimensional it can more easily be treated by numerical and analytical approaches than the full two - dimensional model .",
    "for this reason the spin ladder was subject to many theoretical investigations in recent years @xcite . from a strong coupling perspective",
    "it is reasonable to describe the doped spin ladder by a @xmath2-@xmath3-model @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to derive an effective hamiltonian which describes not only the motion of the magnetic degrees of freedom , i.e. , the triplons @xcite , but also of the charges , i.e. , of the doped holes .",
    "this task is more challenging than the description of the triplons alone because the two kinds of excitations interact strongly and their energy ranges are not separated but they strongly overlap .",
    "hence the excitations are not infinitely long - lived but they decay , at least in certain regions of the brillouin zone .",
    "the technique employed here is the approach of self - similar continuous unitary transformations ( scut ) . in this approach the mapping of the true ground state to a vacuum of elementary excitations",
    "is constructed systematically , details will be explained in sect .",
    "[ chap : scut ] .",
    "the basic idea is to implement a transformation that adjusts itself during the procedure of the diagonalisation depending on the current form of the hamiltonian at this instant of the continuous transformation .",
    "the change of the hamiltonian induced by the transformation is determined by the current magnitude of the non - diagonal elements .",
    "the flowing hamiltonian is given in second quantization , i.e. , it has a certain structure in terms of elementary creation and annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "this formulation incorporates the linked cluster property @xcite automatically .",
    "the scut systematically defines a set of differential equations for the prefactors of the monomials of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the key issue is to construct the flow to the effective hamiltonian in a robust way . due to the energetically overlapping states this goal required modifications @xcite with respect to the previously performed unitary transformations .",
    "thereby we achieved the successful calculation of the dispersion of a single hole .    in sects .",

    "the nearest neighbor hopping is described by the constants @xmath8 ( on the rungs ) and @xmath9 ( along the legs ) .",

    "the spin-@xmath0 ladder is realised in the so called telephone number compounds @xmath10 @xcite . for these systems superconductivity",
    "can be detected under high pressure @xcite .",
    "interactions between the ladders are weak because they result from @xmath11 exchange @xcite . thus the ladders can be considered to be isolated from one other . even if the interladder coupling is taken into account",
    ", the strong frustration of the lattice causes the system to be effectively one - dimensional @xcite .",
    "the dispersions of the magnetic excitations of the complete layer with interladder coupling are similar to those of a single spin ladder .",
    "important magnetic properties of the ladders are investigated in refs .   .",
    "the focus of the present article is the lightly doped spin ladder because this will allow us to address the dynamics of charges .",
    "of course , this system has been investigated previously by many techniques , for instance exact diagonalization @xcite , density - matrix renormalization @xcite , high - order series expansion @xcite , diagrammatic approaches @xcite , and quantum monte carlo @xcite .",
    "hence much is known about the dynamics of a single hole , i.e. , its dispersion , its spectral density and to some extent also about the bound states of two holes .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to establish an approach which generates an effective model for the motion of holes and their interaction with magnetic excitations and other holes .",
    "such a model can be expressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators which create and annihilate holes , i.e. , charge excitations , and triplons , i.e. , magnetic excitations .",
    "the techniques used so far do not yield such an effective model but numerical data for eigen energies and spectral weights .",
    "for this reason we here use the complementary approach of self - similar continuous unitary transformations .    the spin sites in our model ( see fig .",
    "[ ladder ] ) are the @xmath12 orbitals of the copper atoms coupled via the @xmath13 or @xmath14 orbitals of the oxygen atoms , which hybridise with the copper @xmath12 orbitals so that an antiferromagnetic superexchange @xcite is possible .",

    "[ ladder ] ) are not sufficient to describe the magnetic interactions in the system . because the hybridization path around the @xmath16 square plaquettes is strong , the influence of the four - spin interactions belonging to these plaquettes ( i.e.  two neighboring rungs ) is not negligible @xcite .",
    "these interactions are referred to as ring exchange ( also cyclic exchange ) with the coupling @xmath7 ( see fig .  [ ladder ] ) .",
    "actually the complete ring exchange also includes two - spin terms for all two - spin combinations of the four spins on two neighboring rungs . yet the contributions from the terms coupling the spins along the rungs and parallel to the legs are merged with the nearest neighbor terms so that the coupling constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 include these contributions , whereas the terms coupling the spins diagonally can be neglected because their prefactor is only of the order of @xmath17 of @xmath5 @xcite . the complete representation of the ring exchange using spin operators can be found in ref .  .",
    "the hopping of the spins is described by the constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see fig .  [ ladder ] ) .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 already incorporate hardcore properties so that double occupancy is forbidden .",
    "we define the dimensionless quantities @xmath20 which are normalized to @xmath5 .",
    "it is convenient to treat the ladder as a one - dimensional chain of rungs .",
    "there are nine possible local states on a rung @xmath4 of the ladder .",
    "@xmath21    the states without holes are the singlet ( [ singlet ] ) and the triplet states ( [ tripletx]-[tripletz ] ) , for which we use the representation from ref . because the symmetry in spin space is manifest in this representation .",
    "the states consisting of one hole and one spin @xmath0 ( [ hole1]-[hole4 ] ) have the quantum numbers @xmath22 , which is the parity of the state with respect to the symmetry axis of the ladder ( see dashed line in fig .  [ ladder ] ) , and @xmath23 , which indicates whether the @xmath24 component of the spin is up or down .",
    "the double hole state ( [ 2holes ] ) is neglected here because only one - hole states will be considered .",
    "the local energy of @xmath25 is also larger than the energy of the other states .",
    "therefore @xmath25 is expected to be also less important for ladders with low , but macroscopic doping , though it will influence the quantitative results for hole - hole scattering and hole - hole binding .",
    "for the application of the continuous unitary transformation a representation using the creation and annihilation operators for the local states ( [ singlet]-[hole4 ] ) is indicated .",
    "the complete hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the respresentation using these operators can be found in ref .  .",
    "note that the local rung states incorporate hardcore properties .",
    "also the fermionic states exhibit additional hardcore properties which simply result from the fact that each rung can only be in _ one _ particular state .",
    "the excitations are actually dominated by the local states as long as the couplings between the rungs are small .",
    "the magnetic excitations are triplons , i.e. , triplet states dressed with the magnetic interactions with their environment @xcite .",
    "we do not want to use the term `` magnon '' for these magnetic excitations because this term is usually associated with quasiparticles in systems that exhibit long - range magnetic order ( which is not the case for the spin ladder ) .",
    "moreover triplons feature the appropriate threefold degeneracy based on their @xmath26 character @xcite .",
    "we use the method of continuous unitary transformations ( cut ) to obtain an effective hamiltonian @xcite . instead of applying only a single constant unitary transformation that diagonalises the hamiltonian at once or several constant unitary transformations successively ,",
    "a unitary transformation depending on a continuous parameter is applied to the hamiltonian .",
    "this transformation adjusts itself permanently during its application .",
    "discrete transformations must be known explicitly before we can apply them , whereas for the continuous transformation it is sufficient to set up the infinitesimal generator of the transformation .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath27 depending on the continuous parameter @xmath28 transforms the hamiltonian by @xmath29 the generator of the transformation is defined by @xmath30 the generator defines the properties of the transformation .",
    "the derivative of @xmath31 with respect to @xmath28 is given by the so - called flow equation @xmath32\\,\\mathrm{.}\\ ] ] this is actually a system of differential equations ( generically highly coupled ) for the coefficients of the operators appearing in @xmath33 . to achieve the effective hamiltonian the flow equation has to be solved . for a self - similar application of the cut @xcite the hamiltonian",
    "is represented by a sum of different operators @xmath34 , which are products of local operators in second quantization , multiplied by prefactors @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 the operators @xmath34 determine the structure of @xmath33 .",
    "this is the reason why this formulation of the cuts is called self - similar . in particular",
    ", we express the operators @xmath34 in terms of creation and annihilation operators of charge excitations ( holes ) and spin excitations ( triplons ) in the manner introduced previously @xcite .",
    "a reference state , the vacuum , has to be chosen with respect to which these creation and annihilation processes are defined . in our case",
    ", this state is the product of local singlets on the rungs of the ladder . for the undoped ladder",
    "this state is a convenient starting point as seen in many high - order perturbative @xcite and diagrammatic approaches @xcite .",
    "since we focus in this work on single hole dynamics the use of the product of local singlets on the rungs as reference vacuum is well justified .",
    "the differential equations for the @xmath37 are given by the flow equation in the form @xmath38 because an infinite system yields an infinite number of differential equations which can not be solved numerically , we have to apply a truncation to @xmath33 so that a closed system of differential equations is obtained .",
    "we choose a real space truncation because the correlation length is finite for the spin ladder due to the energy gap @xcite .",
    "the concrete truncation scheme is explained in sect .",
    "[ chap : trunc_scheme ] .",
    "it should also be noted that the truncation is only restricted to operators .",
    "there is no truncation of the hilbert space of the states .",
    "thus although operators affecting higher numbers of particles are omitted , the number of particles that can be treated is arbitrarily large . to illustrate this we consider the action of a term in second quantisation , e.g. , @xmath39 , which annihilates one particle and creates two",
    "this term acts not only on the one - particle subspace , but also on the subspaces with more than one particle , e.g.  it changes a four - particle into a five - particle state .",
    "the solution of the flow equation is a rather straightforward numerical integration .",
    "the convergence is monitored during the integration . since all contributions to the generator decrease in case of convergence ,",
    "the absolute values of the concerning coefficients are squared and summed .",
    "the square root of this sum is defined as residual off - diagonality ( rod ) .",
    "it is the norm of the generator and also a measure for the convergence .",
    "the rod is expected to tend to zero for @xmath40 .",
    "note that the term `` off - diagonality '' is meant in a broader sense , i.e.  the definition of the generator determines which elements shall be kept for @xmath40 and these elements are defined as `` diagonal '' parts of the hamiltonian .",
    "the rods depicted in the following are always normalized to the initial rod at @xmath41 .    with the decrease of the rod the wanted effective hamiltonian",
    "is approached .",
    "if the relative rod falls below a certain threshold specifying the precision of the result ( usually @xmath42 ) , the integration can be considered to be completed .",
    "the number of coefficients treated in our actual calculations is of the order up to @xmath43 for the doped spin ladder",
    ".       induced by the pc generator : each coloured ( @xmath44 , @xmath45)-block represents contributions to @xmath31 creating @xmath44 particles after annihilating @xmath45 particles . ]",
    "the particle conserving or pc generator @xmath46 was introduced by mielke for band matrices @xcite for @xmath47 and simultaneously by knetter and uhrig for many - body hamiltonians where @xmath48 counts the number of elementary excitations @xcite .",
    "the indices @xmath49 and @xmath50 label the transition from state @xmath50 to state @xmath49 . these states are eigenstates of an operator @xmath51 , which counts the number of elementary excitations , i.e. , quasi - particles .",
    "the eigen value of @xmath51 for the state @xmath49 is @xmath48 .",
    "the differences between the pc and the wegner generator are discussed by means of simple hamiltonians in ref .  .",
    "in particular the convergence behavior is examined .",
    "the wegner generator @xmath52 $ ] @xcite always leads to a fixed point , but it does not necessarily aim at a quasi - particle picture because degeneracies may hinder the diagonalisation .",
    "the pc generator is not sensitive to degeneracies , but the induced transformation does not always converge for infinite systems .    due to the sign function",
    "the generator ( [ pc generator ] ) contains only terms of the hamiltonian that change the particle number .",
    "terms which decrease the particle number acquire an additional minus sign .",
    "the resulting transformation yields an effective hamiltonian for @xmath40 which conserves the particle number ( see fig .  [ pc cut blocks ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior @xcite of the non - particle - conserving terms , i.e. , @xmath53 , is dominated by @xmath54 because @xmath55 tends to zero for @xmath40 if @xmath53 , the transformation tries to sort the eigenenergies @xmath56 according to the particle number @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath57 holds true for large @xmath28 .",
    "overlapping energies of states with different quasiparticles can hinder the convergence of the flow .",
    "this problem can be solved by excluding terms from the generator @xcite . the ground state or gs generator @xmath58 introduced in ref .",
    "includes only terms that couple to the vacuum @xmath59 of excitations so that in the effective hamiltonian only this vacuum is decoupled from the remaining hilbert space .",
    "then it has become the ground state .",
    "this is sufficient for the calculation of the hole dispersion for the spin ladder if the ground state can be continuously linked to the state without magnetic excitations for a given hole configuration .",
    "this is the case for a single hole at a given momentum close to the minimum of its band .       and @xmath60 .",
    "the cyan ( gray ) dashed lines do not pose a problem because they do not cross the one - particle dispersion .",
    "convergence problems can only be induced by the terms that act on the states with the cyan ( gray ) dotted dispersions , which cross the one - particle dispersion . ]    but even the gs generator encounters convergence problems if the interaction between the rungs becomes too strong , i.e. , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "hence we have developed a generator adaption with a real space restriction of the generator terms .",
    "many terms that remain after the real space truncation of the hamiltonian act on states with discrete energies within the continua ( see fig .   [ generator truncation ] ) .",
    "the divergence of the scut in case of an overlap is not induced by all terms that mediate between overlapping continua , but only by a part of these terms .",
    "thus a stricter real space truncation of the hamiltonian can induce convergence .",
    "however , a stricter truncation causes a larger error for the results of the scut .    therefore we do not apply a stricter truncation to the hamiltonian but we choose a stricter generator .",
    "we emphasize that a restriction of the generator does not imply an approximation .",
    "it only changes the direction of the unitary rotation .",
    "this restriction of the generator is not based on the total extension of the terms , but on the extension of the creation operators and on the extension of the annihilation operators separately .",
    "let us consider the example of an overlap between one- and two - particle energies shown in fig .",
    "[ generator truncation ] .",
    "the terms @xmath63 and @xmath64 are responsible for transitions between the one- and the two - particle subspace .",
    "we choose to restrict the generator based on @xmath65 , which is the distance between the two particles which are created or annihilated . because the one - particle state does not have an extension , it is not relevant for the restriction of the generator .",
    "all terms that have a larger @xmath65 than a certain @xmath66 are excluded from the generator .",
    "note that they are still part of the hamiltonian as long as they meet the truncation criteria for the hamiltonian .",
    "the transformation induced by this restricted generator does not try to sort all eigenenergies ( cf .",
    "[ sorting of the eigen values ] ) , but only those which are captured by the terms in the generator .",
    "therefore the flow may also converge in case of overlapping energies .",
    "the price to be paid is that the subspaces affected by the omitted terms are not completely decoupled from the remaining hilbert space .",
    "thus either an additional diagonalization or a diagrammatic analysis has to be applied to the effective hamiltonian from this scut or the results have to be considered as upper limit for the actual results .",
    "the restriction of the generator can be applied to the pc generator or to any of its adaptions , e.g. , to the gs generator .",
    "the finite energy gap @xmath67 of the triplons @xcite is equivalent to a correlation function which is exponentially decreasing with respect to the distance .",
    "hence a truncation in real space is appropriate .",
    "the extension in real space shall be used as a measure for the physical importance of a term of the hamiltonian . in our quasi one - dimensional spin ladder",
    "the extension of a term is defined as the difference between the smallest and the largest rung index of the local operators within the term .",
    "the simplest way of truncating would be one maximal extension in real space for all terms .",
    "terms exceeding this limit would be omitted .",
    "but this approach is not reasonable in our case .",
    "the number of possible terms increases much more strongly with the maximal extension for terms consisting of more local operators .",
    "however , terms consisting of less operators are usually more important .",
    "hence higher extensions should be taken into account for terms with less operators .",
    "for instance , the coefficient of a one - particle hopping term consisting of two local operators is usually larger than the coefficient of a two - particle interaction term consisting of four local operators if they both have the same extension .",
    "therefore , for the pure triplon terms different maximal extensions @xmath68 are defined in units of the rung distance where @xmath4 is the total number of local operators of the term under study .",
    "because only terms changing the particle number by two or conserving the particle number occur in the initial magnetic hamiltonian , only the @xmath68 with even @xmath4 are meaningful .",
    "by @xmath69 we denote the maximal extension for @xmath70 hole state operators . it does not matter if the term concerned contains additional triplon operators . for terms with triplon and hole state operators",
    ", @xmath69 affects only the hole state operators .",
    "the total maximal extension @xmath71 for these mixed terms depends on the number of triplon operators @xmath72 .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 denotes the maximal number of triplons interacting with holes .",
    "note that @xmath71 with odd @xmath72 have to be taken into account because the triplon number is changed by an odd number if the hole state parity is altered .",
    "additionally a maximal triplon number @xmath74 and a maximal hole number @xmath75 are defined for the operators , i.e. , terms affecting higher triplon numbers than @xmath74 or higher hole numbers than @xmath75 are completely omitted . this truncation scheme is not compulsory .",
    "other schemes could be implemented which use different classifications for the groups of terms sharing the same maximal extension .",
    "since the size of the system of differential equations for the doped ladder grows exponentially with increasing extensions , the truncation for our calculations is fairly strict .",
    "the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 were used for the pure triplon terms because these maximal extensions are sufficient for the undoped case up to @xmath61 .    for the terms including hole operators the truncation used for the scut",

    "the dispersion of a single hole in the absence of triplons can be easily derived from the effective hamiltonian by means of fourier transformation .",
