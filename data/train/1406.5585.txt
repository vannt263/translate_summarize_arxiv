    "locusts and other migrating insects can form cohesive swarms at large population densities , which subsequently travel over huge distances and can have a devastating effect on agriculture .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the mechanisms governing how the population decides collectively on the direction of migration , and the population density at which this occurs .",
    "stochastic models of collective migration can be used to study the population - level effects of individual - level decisions , and can demonstrate sudden changes in collective motion at increased group sizes  @xcite .",
    "investigating the information that an individual may have within a population is an area of active research and is used in modelling efforts  @xcite .",
    "although many existing models produce motion which is qualitatively similar to a variety of forms of collective behaviour  @xcite ( swarming , schooling , flocking etc . )",
    ", very few provide a quantitative comparison to experimental data  @xcite .    to investigate the effects of population density on the swarming of locusts , buhl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed a series of experiments , placing different numbers of locusts in a ring - shaped arena .",
    "they recorded the alignment @xmath0 , which essentially gives the proportion of anticlockwise - moving individuals ( @xmath1 ) subtracted from the proportion of clockwise - moving individuals ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) would indicate that all individuals are moving clockwise ( or anti - clockwise , respectively ) , while @xmath5 represents equal numbers of clockwise - moving and anticlockwise - moving individuals .",
    "the authors observed a rapid transition from disordered to ordered movement as the group size was increased . at low population densities movement",
    "is highly disordered ( fig .",
    "[ figure : experimental_data ] ) . at intermediate densities",
    "the population displays long periods of coherent marching in one direction , punctuated by occasional fast changes in direction ( fig .",
    "[ figure : experimental_data ] ) . at high densities",
    "no direction changes can be seen during the experiment ( fig .",

    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite numerically derived the drift and diffusion coefficients of an assumed underlying stochastic differential equation ( sde ) from the experimental data of buhl _ et al . _",
    "the diffusion coefficient was found to be smaller when the locusts were more aligned ( i.e. close to @xmath6 ) .",
    "the authors adapted a self - propelled particle ( spp ) model  @xcite to include this effect and demonstrated that the adapted model displayed qualitatively similar population - level behaviour to the experimental data . subsequently bode _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed another spp model incorporating particle attraction as well as alignment .",
    "this model inherently generated qualitatively similar drift and diffusion coefficients .",
    "recently biancalani _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used an individual - based model ( ibm ) to describe bistability in foraging ant colonies .",
    "this model demonstrates a kind of bistability where the intrinsic system noise does not simply cause transitions between stable states present in the deterministic formulation , but instead actively constructs the states themselves . in particular",
    ", using a model with two types of individual , who may recruit individuals of the opposing type , or change type at random , the intrinsic noise present in the system is found to be greatest when there are equal numbers of each type of individual and at a minimum when one or other type of individual dominates the population .",
    "the authors analytically derive an sde from the ibm , in which the diffusion coefficient is reduced at the extremes of the domain , similarly to the diffusion coefficient found by yates _",
    "et al . _",

    "we formulate a minimal model that describes the locust experiment  @xcite , following the approach employed by biancalani _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . using a variant of the kramers - moyal expansion @xcite",
    ", we analytically derive an sde directly from this model and thus give formulas for the explicit dependence of the drift and diffusion coefficients on the total number of individuals .",
    "these coefficients indicate that in order to match the experimental data , model locusts must effectively interact with at least two neighbours simultaneously . using a revised coefficient estimation approach we can also derive drift and diffusion coefficients for the experimental data and we use these to estimate model reaction rates consistent with the experimental data .",
    "interestingly , we find that it is not necessary to explicitly incorporate space in our model in order to reproduce the experimentally derived coefficients .",
    "this suggests that the switching behaviour of the locusts is an inherent property of the way they interact with each other and the frequency of those interactions , rather than being a consequence of the particular spatial geometry of the arena .",
    "thus the effect is driven by the density of locusts and their individual interactions .",
    "we quantitatively compare our model against the experimental data by deriving the stationary probability distributions ( spds ) and mean first passage times ( mfpts ) between clockwise and anticlockwise coherent movement .",
    "we consider a population of @xmath7 individuals , split into clockwise - moving ( @xmath8 ) and anticlockwise - moving ( @xmath9 ) populations .",
    "individuals may change direction spontaneously , or decide to change direction as the result of interactions with one or two locusts travelling in the opposite direction .",
    "the model may be summarised in the following system of interactions : @xmath10 thus the rate of transitioning from state @xmath11 to state @xmath12 , @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where we have rescaled the rates @xmath15 for @xmath16 when converting between locust numbers , @xmath8 , and locust proportions , @xmath17 .",

    "hence higher - order interactions between locusts ( _ i.e. _ the @xmath39 interaction ) are required in order for the model to demonstrate the observed coherent motion : long periods of clockwise or anticlockwise movement .",
    "note that including higher - order interactions does not change the qualitative population - level phenomena observed here .",
