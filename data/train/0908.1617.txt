    "the existence of insertions and deletions is well established experimentally .",
    "there has been a recent considerable interest in molecular evolution models of eigen , i.e. , in connected mutation - selection scheme [ 1 - 2 ] , and in the parallel , i.e. ,  decoupled \" mutation schemes [ 3 - 7 ] .",
    "the studies included mean fitness for different fitness landscapes [ 4 - 7 ] , and population distributions under mutation - selection balance constraint [ 8 ] .",
    "since the experimental confirmation of insertion and deletion processes [ 9 ] there have been several studies of molecular evolution models that incorporate base substitutions , insertions , and deletions [ 10 - 12 ] . in this article",
    "we integrate a concept of indels with parallel mutation - selection processes to solve our model with general fitness landscape and derive exact formula for the mean fitness .",
    "in biology research the term indel stands for either insertion alone or deletion alone or both these processes present simultaneously .",
    "indels play an important role in phylogenic analysis in practical population genetics [ 13 ] , where incorrect handling of indels may give unrealistic outcomes .    in the parallel mutation - selection model",
    "any genotype configuration @xmath0 is specified as a sequence of @xmath1 two - valued letters ( alleles ) @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "we denote such configuration @xmath0 by @xmath4 .",
    "probability @xmath5 that configuration @xmath6 occurs in genome , @xmath7 , satisfies @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fitness , and @xmath10 is the mutation rate from @xmath6 to @xmath11 per unit time . for the crow - kimura model [ 4 ] : @xmath12 if the hamming distance @xmath13 is zero , @xmath14 if @xmath15 , and @xmath16 if @xmath17 ; where @xmath18 .    in the models studied here we consider the following three independent parallel processes in the genome : base substitutions , deletions and insertions .",
    "assuming constant genome - variation rates per site , we denote @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 the rates of mutation , insertion , and deletion , respectively , where @xmath22 is the scale length of the genome .",
    "unlike in the well - studied cases of the parallel mutation - selection scheme and the eigen model , now the genome length can be varied . in this paper",
    "we focus only on symmetric fitness landscape , i.e. , when the fitness of the genome is a function of hamming distance from one reference genome sequence .",
    "the fitness is assumed to be either a single - peak function ( i.e. , having one finite discontinuity ) or a smooth function of the hamming distance .    in the first model , analyzed in sec.[ordered ] , we are investigating indels acting in a toy problem when the reference sequence is ordered , i.e. , when it contains only one letter ( either @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) at all positions . obtaining solution to this toy problem",
    "is by no means trivial because neither the maximum principle [ 5 ] nor the hamilton - jacobi method [ 8 ] can be applied directly .",
    "a more realistic case is analyzed in sec.[random ] for random reference sequence when the letters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are randomly distributed along genome length .",
    "for symmetric fitness in parallel mutation - selection model without indels the choice of the reference sequence does not affect the solution , which is a consequence of the existing symmetry of the governing equations .",
    "the introduction of indels to the model breaks this symmetry and the effect of indels acting on sequence space is to change the solution .",
    "this change depends on the choice of the reference sequence .",
    "if we choose as the reference sequence the one with all @xmath25 alleles , the result of deletion is the same for all the n possible position of deleted allele . in case a random reference sequence",
    "we have different results ( sequences ) after different positions of deleted allele . in our model ,",
    "an individual indel event means either insertion or deletion of a single letter in the genome sequence , one at a time , but there may be many indel events during evolution . in this article",
    "we focus on investigating a  successful selection \" phase , i.e. , the phase ( range of parameters ) with majority of population being localized around the reference sequence .",
    "our results are discussed in sec.[discussion ] .",
    "we choose the reference sequence that has all the alleles @xmath23 and the initial distribution of sequences that is symmetric under permutations .",
    "individual configuration is denoted by @xmath26 , where @xmath1 is genome length , and @xmath27 is the number of ( @xmath23)-alleles in the configuration .",
    "the fitness is @xmath28 . considering only one - letter deletion or insertion at a time",
    "there may be three processes that start at @xmath29 and end at @xmath26 :    * simple base substitutions at the rate of @xmath19 . at the beginning",
    "there are @xmath27 configurations @xmath30 and @xmath31 configurations with @xmath32 .",
    "* deletions at the rate of @xmath20 . at the beginning",
    "there are @xmath33 configurations @xmath34 and @xmath33 configurations with @xmath35 . *",
    "insertion at the rate of @xmath21 . at the beginning",
    "there are @xmath27 configurations @xmath36 and @xmath37 configurations @xmath38 .    during base substitutions the letters ( alleles ) change their signs . during deletion one of the letters",
    "disappears . during insertion a new letter ( either @xmath23 or @xmath24 )",
    "is added randomly at any of the @xmath39 positions along the chain .",
    "there are two interests in solving this model , usually treated separately .",
    "one interest concerns to genome growth [ 10 - 12 ] .",
    "the other interest is the study of successive selection phase , which we present here for the case when selections and base - substitutions are accompanied by deletions and insertions .    the occurrence probability @xmath40 denotes a fractional number of configurations @xmath26 in the population .",
    "for symmetric fitness landscape and permutation - symmetric initial distribution , probabilities @xmath40 satisfy the equations @xcite : @xmath41 \\frac{n+1}{n_0 } \\\\ & + \\frac{c}{2 } \\left ( p(n-1,l-1)\\frac{l}{n_0}+p(n-1,l)\\frac{n - l}{n_0 } \\right ) \\\\ & -p(n , l)\\sum_{n',l'}r(n',l')p(n',l ' ) \\binom{n'}{l'}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in case of symmetric fitness landscape , for finding steady - state mean fitness it is sufficient to consider only symmetric evolution .",
    "we solved eq.([e2 ] ) numerically , varying genome length between @xmath42 and @xmath43 subject to @xmath44 .",
    "the numerical results for two values of genome length are presented in fig .  1 .    = 0.1 cm    ( 80,110 ) ( -26,56 )    ( -26,0 )    ( 20,100 ) ( 20,44 )",
    "( 2 ) is slightly modified near the border values of n , as at @xmath43 there are only deletions and at @xmath42-only insertions .",
    "the weighted sum over all equations is zero , where the weights @xmath45 are numbers of configurations with the same @xmath1 and @xmath27 .    for single - peak fitness landscape we set all fitness values to zero but one : @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in continuous - time model , considered in this work , fitness landscape eq.([e3 ] ) can be rescaled by an additive constant , which is a standard procedure in statistical physics . in discrete - time models all fitness values would have to be positive . for base substitutions acting alone without indels , with the choice given by eq.([e3 ] ) the system of eqs.([e2 ] ) decouples , which leads to a single equation for only one master - type ( reference sequence ) probability [ 6 ] from which other probabilities are obtained recursively . when base substitutions and indels are simultaneously acting , for single - peak fitness defined by eq.([e3 ] ) the system eqs.([e2 ] ) does not decouple but , nonetheless , can be reduced to a tractable problem that can be treated analytically .",
    "the reduction procedure is outlined in the next paragraphs .",
    "we consider the following scaling of eqs.([e2 ] ) : @xmath48 since the scaling ( [ e4 ] ) suppresses contributions from all terms @xmath26 for @xmath49 as @xmath50 , after the scaling we obtain a complete set of equations for the class @xmath51 of frequencies .",
    "for example , for @xmath52 we derive from eqs.([e2 ] ) : @xmath53 which is easily verified to be consistent with the scaling ansatz ( [ e4 ] ) .    denoting by @xmath54 a collection of all @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , we write eq.([e2 ] ) for @xmath55 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean fitness , @xmath59 ; and , the elements of matrix @xmath60 are @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is kronecker s symbol . in successful - selection phase",
    "the majority of population is distributed around the configuration @xmath64 .",
    "the details of matrix @xmath60 near the borders at @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , are irrelevant for the computation of the mean fitness in the successful - selection phase in the sense that the mean fitness is insensitive to variations in these border values .",
    "the mean fitness @xmath58 is obtained in the standard way as the largest eigenvalue of @xmath60 by solving the secular equation @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the identity matrix , and @xmath70 .    to calculate @xmath58 within the @xmath71-accuracy we utilize the properties of determinant and in eq.([e7 ] ) , modify the matrix @xmath72 , taking @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "then , we define an auxiliary function @xmath75 by @xmath76 . since @xmath75 is linear we write @xmath77 where @xmath78 ; the matrix @xmath79 is the value of the matrix @xmath60 computed at @xmath80 ; and , @xmath81 is the first derivative of @xmath75 computed at @xmath80 .",
    "because matrix @xmath79 is symmetric and cyclic it is relatively straightforward to write @xmath82 and @xmath81 explicitly : @xmath83 in the thermodynamic limit of large @xmath84 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , the infinite summation on the right - hand - side of eq.([e8 ] ) becomes a contour integral in complex plane .",
    "the left - hand - side of eq.([e8 ] ) is @xmath85 and @xmath86 because of eq.([e7 ] ) .",
    "thus , making the substitution @xmath87 , eq.([e8 ] ) gives the relation between the mean fitness @xmath58 and the fitness @xmath88 of the peak configuration : @xmath89 inverting eq.([e9 ] ) gives the mean fitness @xmath58 and fractional population @xmath90 of the peak configuration : @xmath91 and the error - threshold condition @xmath92 results of eqs.([e3 ] ) and ( [ e10 ] ) are illustrated in fig .",
    "1a .      the sharp - peak fitness defined by eq.([e3 ] )",
    "is an oversimplification as it is believed that realistic fitness landscapes are highly complicated and irregular . as a step towards generalization we consider now fitness that is nonzero at only one @xmath1 value , set to @xmath93 , and at many values of @xmath27 . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the number of the ( @xmath23)-alleles in the genome and hamming distance to the reference configuration is @xmath31 . for this more general fitness",
    "we take @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a smooth function . following a method introduced by baake and wagner @xcite",
    "we transform eqs.([e1 ] ) to a more convenient form with the use of the substitution @xmath96 equations for the weighted fractional populations @xmath97 simplify in the large - genome limit . for the computation of the mean fitness",
    "they are easier to handle than the original eqs.([e1 ] ) .",
    "we have checked rigorously by calculating the distribution @xmath97 that it is a smooth function of @xmath98 for the given @xmath93 , although it is not smooth for all @xmath1 .",
    "assuming that @xmath97 is a smooth function of @xmath99 near @xmath93 and near the location @xmath100 of its maximum , we replace @xmath97 with @xmath101 in the coupled system of equations for @xmath97 that was obtained from eqs.([e1 ] ) after applying transformation ( [ e13 ] ) .",
    "as described for single - peak fitness , this gives a partial decoupling .",
    "for the decoupled part we have the eigenvalue problem @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath70 .",
    "again , the matrix @xmath60 is tri - diagonal . in the limit of large @xmath1 the eigenproblem for @xmath60",
    "gives @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "there is full analogy between this problem and the problem already solved for single - peak function .",
    "quadratic form for the single - peak problem can be obtained from quadratic form for the current problem by performing the mapping : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 . by repeating the steps that lead to eq.([e9 ] )",
    "we derive @xmath110 theoretical results of eqs.([e12 ] ) and ( [ e15 ] ) for quadratic fitness are presented in fig .",
    "1b .      for the ordered reference sequence we assume now nonzero fitness at many @xmath1 and @xmath27 values , i.e. , fitness is a function of both genome length and the number of @xmath111-alleles : @xmath112 we assume that fitness @xmath113 is a smooth function of both its arguments , i.e. , it is also smooth in genome length .",
    "this is in contrast to the model of sec.[ordereda ] where the fitness may change drastically even within one unit of genome length .",
    "as in the previous two examples , to find the mean fitness @xmath58 it is requested in our approach that distribution @xmath114 must have a maximum localized at @xmath1 and @xmath115 .",
    "then , if the maximum exists the system of equations eqs.([e1 ] ) for fractional populations can be partially decoupled at configuration @xmath116 .",
    "this leads to the algebra problem of finding the largest eigenvalue of a matrix , @xmath117 . in analogy with eq.([e14 ] ) , the intermediary result is @xmath118 finally , the mean fitness @xmath58 is the largest eigenvalue @xmath119 that is obtained by solving eqs.([e17 ] ) : @xmath120 note , the final result eq.([e18 ] ) requires finding the maximum in two - dimensional space of arguments @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "in this model a reference sequence contains both @xmath23 and @xmath24 alleles that are randomly distributed along the entire genome length .",
    "single - peak fitness is analyzed in the next paragraph , followed by the extension of the model to general symmetric fitness .    when reference configuration contains a number of pieces with consecutive @xmath123 number of all @xmath111-alleles or all @xmath124-alleles per piece , the mean fitness scales according to @xmath125 since for the random reference sequence we have @xmath126 , eq.([e19 ] ) implies that in this case the number of configurations that return to the initial reference sequence is negligible and can be neglected .",
    "the final result is exactly the same as though there were only base substitutions with the rate @xmath127 : @xmath128 and error threshold condition is @xmath129    for continuous - time eigen s model , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 , the presence of indels modifies error threshold to : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the probability of errorless reproduction of the entire genome .    in general - symmetric - fitness model",
    "the fitness is defined by eq.([e16 ] ) , where we replace @xmath27 by a parameter @xmath134 that explicitly contains hamming distance @xmath135 between the current configuration and reference configuration . here ,",
    "for any genome length @xmath1 there is its reference configuration , thus , the hamming distance @xmath135 is the second independent parameter in the definition of general fitness : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is assumed to be a smooth function of two parameters . by the method outlined in sec.[ordered ]",
    "we obtain the following general result for the mean fitness @xmath138",
    "the toy model with ordered reference sequence and single - peak fitness , studied in sec.[ordered ] , is an interesting case from methodological point of view .",
    "it describes the evolution when there is a desperate difference between genome length @xmath1 and the number @xmath27 of @xmath111-alleles in fractional - population distribution .",
    "genotype frequencies for this class are smooth functions of @xmath27 in the neighborhood of the peak distribution .",
    "error - threshold condition , eq.([e11 ] ) , depends on all the rates in a nonlinear fashion because of the existence of reversal processes introduced by indels , which processes may drive the evolution towards the reference sequence .",
    "this picture is unlike to what we learn from crow - kimura ( parallel ) model without indels , where error threshold depends linearly on the rates . in the generalized model with single - peak fitness ,",
    "studied in sec.[random ] , where the reference sequence is a random sequence of @xmath23 and @xmath24 alleles , the error - threshold formula , eq.([e21 ] ) , simplifies again to that for the crow - kimura model with an efficient base substation rate .",
    "general symmetric - fitness model with random reference sequence , analyzed in sec.[random ] , presents most realistic situation where both genome length and reference sequence are allowed to vary . in this work we investigated only steady - state characteristics of this model .    in our computational approach",
    "we used standard methods of linear algebra to partially decouple a system of evolutionary equations around the peak distribution and find the mean fitness as the largest eigenvalue of the decoupled subsystem .",
    "as the excellent agreement between our analytical and numerical solutions demonstrates ( see fig .",
    "1 ) our methodology has a promise of becoming a routine approach in solving general evolutionary problems with varying genome length , alongside the methods of quantum mechanics @xcite that are good when genome length is fixed , and the methods of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "haploid models with indels that were studied in this work can be extended to diploid evolution models with parallel insertions and deletions .",
    "similar complex models were already considered to study the evolution of gene families via conversion processes @xcite and gene crossover processes @xcite .",
    "the latter mentioned mechanisms could be in principle handled analytically by modern methods @xcite that proved to be successful in treating diploid evolution @xcite .    in evolution research",
    "the models often ignore either selection processes [ 10 - 12 ] or indels [ 2 - 7 ] , however , it is generally accepted that the concurrent selection and indels play an important role in biology .",
    "the models that are capable to describe these two processes as acting simultaneously could give connection with the phylogeny analysis and with the investigation of gene families .",
    "our introductory study of this work shows that it is possible to analytically derive some class of results when selection is accompanied by indels .",
    "in summary , in this work we introduced a method that allows one to investigate a broad class of evolution models .",
    "we solved parallel mutation - selection model with general symmetric - fitness landscapes in case of simultaneously acting base substitutions , insertions and deletions .",
    "our findings indicate that in the steady state of this evolution model the mean fitness depends strongly on the choice of the reference sequence .",
