    "in order to understand abrupt increase in viscosity of liquids approaching the glass transition , it is necessary to understand well the nature of viscosity itself .",

    "one standard approach to calculate viscosity in computer simulations is based on the green - kubo expression that relates viscosity to the integral of the macroscopic stress correlation function @xcite .",
    "properties of the stress correlation function have been extensively studied previously from _ a macroscopic _ perspective @xcite . there have been significantly fewer studies that tried to address how behavior of the system at the atomic level translates into the macroscopic behavior of the stress correlation function @xcite .    the situation is similar with a closely related but somewhat different approach , i.e. , the approach based on considerations of the transverse current correlation function @xcite .",
    "studies of vibrational dynamics in disordered media with the transverse current correlation function are very common and several important results were obtained with it relatively recently @xcite . however ,",
    "in all these studies the transverse current correlation function is treated as a _",
    "macroscopic _ quantity .",
    "thus the relations between the atomic level processes and the macroscopic behavior of the transverse current correlation function remain obscure @xcite .",
    "we previously studied _ atomic level structure _ of the macroscopic green - kubo stress correlation function by decomposing it into correlation functions between the atomic level stresses @xcite .",
    "the approach represents further development of preceding works @xcite .",
    "our data clearly show presence of stress waves in the atomic level stress correlation function and that the stress waves contribute to viscosity @xcite .",
    "however , it was not previously discussed _ how _ stress waves and their properties translate into the observed atomic level stress correlation functions .",
    "it is difficult to address this issue in liquids , even qualitatively , as vibrational and configurational dynamics in liquids are mixed @xcite .",
    "moreover , vibrational and configurational dynamics in disordered media are puzzles by themselves @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , as it appears from the review of the previous literature , the details of the connection between vibrational dynamics and _ the atomic level _ stress correlation function were not addressed previously even for those systems for which it could be done relatively easily , i.e. , for the crystals .",
    "applicability of results obtained from crystal models to liquids , in general , is not expected and should be considered with caution .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that parallels between liquid and solid states can be useful @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to gain at least some qualitative or semiquantitative insight into the connection between the vibrational dynamics of a model liquid and the atomic level stress correlation functions observed in md simulations @xcite , we examine a crystal - like model in which vibrations are represented by plane waves .",
    "considerations in this paper represent further developments and more detailed discussions of some ideas and a model first presented in ref.@xcite .",

    "this analysis is presented in ref.@xcite .",

    "it is useful to address several other issues . in particular , we calculate atomic level stress energies . in this context",
    "we discuss the data from previously published md simulations on liquids and glasses @xcite .    in the framework of the model it is easy to evaluate the peak broadening in the pair distribution function with increasing distance .",
    "calculations show that the peak broadening ( by @xmath0 ) occurs because of the transverse waves , while the contribution from the longitudinal waves only weakly depends on distance .",

    ". we will also utilize debye s model , i.e. , we will change summation over different waves into the integration over the wavevector : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total number of atoms in the system and also the total number of vibrational states for one polarization .",

    "besides the differences mentioned above , it is clear that the contribution to the stress correlation function from the transverse waves observed in md simulation and in the present calculations are qualitatively similar .",
    "in particular , if we consider how intensity changes with increase of time for a given distance we observe at first positive intensity and then negative intensity .    formula ( [ eq;ppcf06 ] ) suggests that the speed of the wave corresponds to the slope of the first boundary between the positive and negative intensities .",

    "we analyze what information could be obtained by performing fourier transforms of these stress correlation functions ( [ eq;ppcf05],[eq;cxycorr04 ] ) .",
    "thus further we consider a function which is structurally similar to the stress correlation functions ( [ eq;ppcf05],[eq;cxycorr04 ] ) : @xmath154 for the shear stress correlation function due to the transverse waves ( [ eq;cxycorr04 ] ) , for example , we have : @xmath155 where @xmath38 is a numerical coefficient .",
    "note that @xmath156 , as we define it , is the correlation function per pair of particles multiplied by @xmath73 .    further we define : @xmath157 from ( [ eq;ftr21x],[eq;ftr11],[eq;ftr12 ] ) we get : @xmath158 where @xmath159 .",
    "thus @xmath160 , for every value of @xmath59 , oscillates in time with the period determined by the dispersion relation .",
    "the decrease in the amplitude of oscillations with increase of time is determined by the damping function @xmath147 ( [ eq;ftr12 ] ) .",
    "if there were no damping function the amplitude of oscillations would remain constant .",
    "the situation with the fourier transform of @xmath156 over time is more complicated . in general , for liquids the damping function is not exponential , but a function that describes different relaxation regimes . for an exponential damping function",
    "it is possible to perform the fourier transform of the integrand in ( [ eq;ftr11 ] ) in a closed analytical form .",

    "transverse current correlation function similarly to how it was done for the atomic level stress correlation function in ref .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to gain an insight into the connection between the atomic level vibrational dynamics and the atomic level green - kubo stress correlation function .",
    "the understanding of this connection is needed to interpret the results of the previous md simulations of a model liquid @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we considered a simple model in which vibrations are plane waves .",
    "such representation of vibrations does not imply that we think that vibrations in liquids or glasses are plane waves .",
    "the situation in disordered materials is much more complex @xcite .",
    "however , the model that we consider is solvable , and it provides the needed insight and a recipe for the analysis in fourier space of the atomic level stress correlation functions obtained in md simulations @xcite .    atoms , as they move , do not decompose their motions into the orthogonal vibrational modes .",
    "instead , they experience forces and stresses . from this perspective",
    ", the comparisons of the atomic level stress correlation functions from different liquids and temperatures may provide valuable and , probably , more physical insights into the atomic scale dynamics than the considerations of the vibrational eigenmodes .",
    "further we discuss why atomic level stress energies obtained in md simulations are significantly larger than the values obtained in this paper . in the framework of the studied model the average atomic level stress energies in the long wavelength approximation and at high temperatures are similar to those in ref.@xcite .    to summarize ,",
    "if the long wavelength approximation is not assumed then the pressure / shear stress energy within the model is approximately 8/3 times smaller than the value obtained from md simulations @xcite .",
    "if the long wavelength approximation is assumed then the pressure stress energy is 2 times smaller than the value from md simulations , while the shear stress energy is approximately equal to the value from md .",
    "please , see also the text preceding to equation ( [ eq;elastc01 ] ) .",
    "the dependencies of the atomic level stress energies on temperature , obtained in md simulations on a liquid and its glass , can be found in fig.3 of ref.@xcite and in fig.5 of ref.@xcite . if @xmath178 ( k ) the system is in a liquid state . if @xmath179 ( k ) ,",
    "the system is in a glass state .",
    "note , in the figures , that at @xmath180 ( k ) the atomic level stress energies have a finite value @xmath181 . at @xmath180 ( k )",
    "there are no vibrations in the classical systems .",
    "thus the values of the atomic level stress energies at @xmath180 ( k ) are determined only by the structural disorder , which also includes variations in the coordination numbers between the different atoms , as can be seen in fig.2 of ref.@xcite .    in our present calculations of the atomic level stress energies , it was assumed that every atom interacts with @xmath1 neighbors .",
    "it was also assumed that @xmath1 is the same for every atom .",
    "but in the previous calculations of the atomic level stress energies with md simulations , no distinction was made between the atoms with different coordination numbers @xcite .",
    "formulas ( [ eq;pressure06],[eq;sepsilon02 ] ) show that average squares of the atomic level stresses are proportional to @xmath1 , while ( [ eq;elastc01 ] ) shows that elastic constants are also proportional to @xmath1 . from this perspective , if all atoms have the same coordination , the atomic level stress energies , which are proportional to the ratio of the average squares of the stresses to the relevant elastic constants , should not exhibit dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "however , in the previous md simulations , the average squares of the stresses and the average values of the elastic constants were obtained by averaging over the atoms with different @xmath1 .",
    "thus a ( large ) part of the average atomic level stress energies obtained in previous md simulations in the glass and in the liquid states might be related to the variations in the coordination numbers between the different atoms .",
    "another possibility might be associated with inapplicability of the spherical approximation for certain coordination numbers or with inapplicability of the plane wave approximation .",
    "atomic level stresses were originally applied to a model of metallic glass in order to describe structural disorder @xcite .",
    "later it was briefly discussed that it might be possible to speak about structural and vibrational contributions to the atomic level stresses @xcite .",
    "however , no systematic attempts to separate structural and vibrational contributions to the atomic level stresses were previously made .",
    "considerations of the atomic level stress energies for the subsets of atoms with different coordination numbers should help to elucidate the roles of structural disorder and vibrational dynamics .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite .    in the glass state , dependencies of the atomic level stress energies on temperature ( obtained in md simulations ) can approximately be described by a formula : @xmath182 .",
    "it is natural to associate @xmath181 with the structural contribution , while @xmath183 with the vibrational contribution .",
    "note that the rates of increase of the atomic level stress energies in the glass obtained from md simulations are larger than the values that we derived in this paper ( see formulas ( [ eq;pressure06 ] ) and ( [ eq;epsilon041 ] ) ) .",
    "note also that , according to the present paper , the rates of increase of the pressure and shear energies should be different .",
    "however , previous md simulations show similar rates .",
    "this can reflect the fact that vibrations in disordered media are not plane waves as we assumed here .",
    "it also can reflect the fact that structural disorder changes even in the glass state .",
    "for example , as temperature increases ( still in the glass state ) there is a weak change in the number of atoms with a given coordination as can be seen in fig.2 of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , this weak change can also be a consequence of the vibrational dynamics",
    ".    in the liquid state temperature dependence of the atomic level stress energies closely follows @xmath184 .",
    "absence of @xmath181 in the last formula suggests that in the liquid state there is no  frozen in \" structural contribution .",
    "thus fig.3 of ref.@xcite and fig.5 of ref.@xcite suggest that it might be possible to speak about vibrational and configurational degrees of freedom in the glass state .",
    "however , in the liquid states these degrees of freedom appear to be completely mixed .    in derivations of the @xmath184 law for the atomic level stress energies , it was assumed that the values of atomic level stresses can vary from @xmath185 to @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "any , in magnitude , contribution to the atomic level stress can come from the repulsive part of the potential for a given coordination number because very large forces can originate from the repulsive core . on the other hand ,",
    "only a limited contribution can come from the attractive part of the potential for a given coordination number .",
    "this also can be the reason why the equipartition result does not hold for a fixed coordination number , but holds when averaging is done over all coordination numbers .",
    "derivation of the equipartition from the boltzmann distribution @xcite implies the presence of ergodicity for every central atom and its coordination shell . in the liquid state , time averaging over every atom is equal to the ensemble average . in the glass state ,",
    "as the coordination numbers of many atoms are fixed on the timescale of a simulation , time average of the stress for every particular atom is not equal to the ensemble average .",
    "thus , breakdown of equipartition of the atomic level stress energies at the glass transition might signal ergodicity breaking .",
    "finally , we note that the total potential energy of the system per atom follows @xmath100 law ( see fig.3 of ref.@xcite ) in the glass state , i.e. , it follows the equipartition law and it grows faster than the energies of the atomic level stresses .",
    "thus , the energies of the atomic level stresses obtained from our calculations here or in the previous md simulations do not capture the total increase in potential energy .    in the liquid state",
    ", the total potential energy grows faster than @xmath100 in the range of temperatures between the glass transition temperature and the potential energy landscape crossover temperature ( see fig.3 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "thus , the total potential energy again grows faster than the energy of the atomic level stresses . in this range of temperatures ,",
    "the total potential energy follows the rosenfeld - tarazona law @xmath187 @xcite , where @xmath188 is the energy at the glass transition .",
    "the value of the coefficient @xmath189 is such that in the studied range of temperatures ( which covers all reasonable temperatures ) , potential energy of a liquid is larger than @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the energies of the local atomic level stresses and the harmonic approximation made in their derivations do not reflect all processes that happen in the model liquid upon heating .",
    "we would like to thank t. egami , v.n .",
    "novikov , and k.a .",
    "lokshin for useful discussions .                                                                                            for transverse waves it is convenient to represent @xmath190 as a linear combination of vectors @xmath191 , @xmath192 which are orthogonal to @xmath193 and to each other .",
