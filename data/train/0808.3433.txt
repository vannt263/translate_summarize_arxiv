    "for a large taxonomic group under stable macroevolutionary conditions , how many species have a mass @xmath0 ?",
    "this question has wide implications for the evolution and distribution of many other species characteristics that correlate strongly with body mass , including life span , life history , habitat , metabolism and extinction risk  @xcite .",
    "extant species , including mammals , birds , fish and insects , exhibit a canonical form of the species mass distribution  @xcite , in which the typical mass is an intermediate value ; for example , in mammals the typical mass is that of the common pacific rat ( _ rattus exulans _ , @xmath1 ) .",
    "larger or smaller species , in turn , are significantly less common , but asymmetrically so : the largest species , such as the extinct imperial mammoth ( _ mammuthus imperator _ ,",
    "@xmath2 ) for terrestrial mammals , are many orders of magnitude larger , while the smallest is only a little smaller , e.g. , the remy s pygmy shrew ( _ suncus remyi _ , @xmath3 ) .    the ubiquity of this distribution of species masses ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic]a ) suggests the existence of a universal evolutionary mechanism .",
    "a theoretical explanation of this distribution may shed light both on the interaction between ecological and macroevolutionary processes  @xcite , and on long - term trends in species mass  @xcite , including cope s rule , the oft - studied notion that species mass tends to increase within a lineage over evolutionary time  @xcite .",
    "clauset and erwin  ( @xcite ) recently showed , by comparing extensive computer simulations with empirical data , that cladogenetic diffusion in the presence of a taxon - specific lower limit on mass @xmath4 and extinction risks that grow weakly with mass , can explain both the canonical form described above , and the precise form of the distribution of terrestrial mammal masses .    here , we present a simplified three - parameter version of the clauset and erwin ( ce ) model for the species mass distribution and solve this model in the steady state . comparing the predictions of this simplified model with species mass data for the same 4002 terrestrial mammals from the late quaternary  @xcite ( henceforth denoted `` recent '' mammals , which includes species that have become extinct during the holocene ) , we reproduce clauset and erwin s results .",
    "we then show that the model s predictions , when appropriately parameterized , are also in good agreement with data for 8617 extant avian species  @xcite .",
    "many models of the variation of species body mass over evolutionary time assume a cladogenetic diffusion process  @xcite where each descendant species mass @xmath5 is related to its ancestor s mass @xmath6 by a random multiplicative factor @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic]b ) , where @xmath7 represents the total selective influence on the descendant species mass from all sources .",
    "clauset and erwin  ( @xcite ) studied a family of such diffusion models , whose form and parameters could be estimated empirically . under their model ,",
    "the evolution of species mass is bounded on the lower end by hard physiological limits , perhaps from metabolic  @xcite or morphological constraints  @xcite , and on the upper end by an extinction risk that increases weakly with mass  @xcite . near the lower limit , however , within - lineage changes to body mass become increasingly biased toward larger masses , i.e. , @xmath9 increases as @xmath10 .    using model parameters estimated from ancestor - descendant data on extinct north american terrestrial mammals since the cretaceous - tertiary boundary  @xcite , clauset and erwin simulated @xmath11 of mammalian body mass evolution and found that the predicted distribution closely matches that of 4002 recent terrestrial mammal species .",
    "they also found that simpler diffusion models , e.g. , those that omitted either the lower limit , an increased extinction risk from increased mass , or the increased bias toward larger masses as @xmath10 , predicted significantly different distributions .",
    "thus , these three mechanisms can explain not only the canonical form of the species mass distribution , but also its taxon - specific shape .",
    "the ce model , however , remains too complex for mathematical analysis , even though it omits many ecological and microevolutionary processes such as interspecific competition , predation , and population dynamics . by simplifying its assumptions slightly",
    ", we can formulate a diffusion - reaction model of species body mass evolution , which retains most of the key features of the ce model and which can be mathematically analyzed .",
    "this model can then be used to make inferences about body mass evolution without resorting to laborious simulations .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the number of species with logarithmic mass @xmath13 at time @xmath14 , i.e. , we transform the ce model s multiplicative diffusion process into an additive diffusion process on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the cladogenesis mechanism leads to two offspring species in which . in the continuum limit , a value @xmath15 ( cope s rule ) corresponds to positive drift velocity in the equation of motion for @xmath12 . in the ce model for terrestrial mammals ,",
    "the drift velocity was estimated from fossil data to increase like @xmath16 near the lower limit on species mass , a feature that clauset and erwin found was necessary to accurately predict the number of small - bodied mammals .",
    "( whether this quarter - power form is related to the quarter - power scaling commonly found elsewhere in the body - size literature  @xcite remains to be seen . ) for mathematical simplicity , however , we will ignore this dependence at the expense of possibly mis - estimating the number of small - bodied species .",
    "we also assume that selection pressures on body mass are roughly independent , implying that the distribution of changes @xmath7 is approximately lognormal ( but see  @xcite ) .",
    "the feature that two offspring are produced at each update step corresponds to a population growth term in the equation of motion that is proportional to @xmath17 itself .",
    "the extinction probability may also be represented by a loss term that is proportional to @xmath17 . for terrestrial mammals , recent empirical studies",
    "@xcite support the assumption that the probability per unit time of a species becoming extinct @xmath18 grows weakly with its mass .",
    "the ce model uses a simple parameterization of this behavior : where @xmath19 , which corresponds to an extinction probability that grows logarithmically with species mass .",
    "is related to the mass of its ancestor @xmath6 by a random multiplicative factor @xmath7 , which represents the total selective influence on species mass from all sources , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   is related to the mass of its ancestor @xmath6 by a random multiplicative factor @xmath7 , which represents the total selective influence on species mass from all sources , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    combining these three elements  diffusion , cladogenesis , and extinction  we may write the continuum equation of motion @xmath12 for the number of species with mass @xmath13 at time @xmath14 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the drift velocity ( strength of cope s rule ) and the variance @xmath23 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "( in physics , eq .   is called the convection - diffusion equation or the fokker - planck equation . ) this equation , however , omits the lower limit on species body mass , which we incorporate momentarily .    the time - dependent equation of motion itself may be useful for studying evolutionary trends in species body mass , or for making inferences about correlated extinction or speciation events . for our purposes , however , we are mainly interested in its stationary solution .",
    "such a steady - state should exist whenever all species within the taxon experience roughly the same set of macroevolutionary selective pressures , i.e. , under stable macroevolutionary conditions . to derive this solution",
    ", we set the time derivative in eq .",
    "to zero to obtain @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath28 .",

    "is @xmath34 , where ai@xmath35 and bi@xmath35 are the airy functions . since there can be no species with infinite mass we may set @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is then determined by the normalization of @xmath38 .",
    "thus we can now write the species mass distribution as : @xmath39 \\enspace .",

    "using the fact that the first zero of the airy function is located at , which we now require to coincide with @xmath42 , gives the constraint @xmath43 which we may solve for @xmath44 . inserting this result into eq .",
    "yields @xmath45 \\enspace , \\label{eq : simple}\\ ] ] as the steady - state solution for the species mass distribution .",
    "if the lower limit @xmath40 is known , this simple - minded model has only two parameters : @xmath46 , associated with the biased diffusion process and @xmath47 , associated with the extinction process .",
    "a positive bias in the diffusion @xmath48 ( cope s rule ) has several systematic effects on the distribution of species masses : it ( i ) pushes the left tail of the distribution away from the lower limit at @xmath40 , ( ii ) shifts the modal mass toward slightly larger values , and ( iii ) extends the right tail of the distribution .",
    "in contrast , increasing @xmath47 implies that species become extinct with greater probability for a given mass @xmath0 , which contracts the right tail of the distribution . for a given bias @xmath46 and number of species @xmath49",
    ", the parameter @xmath47 also set an effective upper limit on the expected maximum observed mass within the taxon without invoking a hard boundary , e.g. , from biomechanical constraints  @xcite .",
    "we now test the predictions of this simple mathematical model using empirical data for 4002 recent terrestrial mammals  @xcite and 8617 birds  @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "we take , the size of the smallest known mammal , and we estimate and ( se ) from alroy s ancestor - descendant data for north american terrestrial mammals  @xcite . incorporating these values into eq .",
    "leaves only @xmath47 unspecified .",
    "a strong test of this model would estimate @xmath47 from fossil data ; however , while studies of extinction among mammals suggest that @xmath50  @xcite , current data does not appear to be sufficiently detailed to give a precise estimate for mammals . instead ,",
    "following clauset and erwin  ( @xcite ) , we choose @xmath47 by minimizing the tail - weighted kolmogorov - smirnov ( wks ) goodness - of - fit statistic  @xcite for the predicted and empirical distributions : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the empirical distribution function and @xmath53 is the predicted cumulative distribution function .",
    "thus , small values of wks correspond to a model that is statistically close to the empirical data everywhere .",
    "we find that two alternative methods of choosing @xmath47 , by numerically matching the modal masses of the model and the empirical data or by matching the expected maximum mass of the model with the observed maximum in the empirical data , produce similar results .     with ( smoothed ) empirical data for 4002 terrestrial mammals from the late quaternary .",

    "body mass estimates were derived using conventional techniques ( for example , dentition techniques for mammals  @xcite ) . for simplicity , differences due to sexual dimorphism , geographic variation , etc .",
    "were ignored or averaged out .",
    "although such differences can be critical for smaller studies , given the scale of our data , in terms of the number of species studied and the wide range of body masses , mild misestimates of body masses are unlikely to change our conclusions unless they are widespread and systematic .",
    "the resulting fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mammals]a ) is in good agreement with the empirical data , except for a slight overestimate of the number of species with mass near @xmath56 , an underestimate of the number near @xmath57 , and a slight misestimate of the number of very small - bodied species .",
    "the deviations in the right tail are also seen in the ce model and may be due to , e.g. , phylogenetically correlated speciation or extinction events in the recent past",
    ". the deviations in the left tail may be due to our omission of the mass - dependence in the drift term @xmath46 identified by clauset and erwin ; however , incorporating this behavior into our diffusion - reaction model is technically non - trivial .",
    "thus , the evolution of mammalian species body masses can largely be viewed as a simple diffusion process , characterized by ( i ) a slight within - lineage drift toward larger masses over evolutionary time ( cope s rule ) , ( ii ) a hard lower boundary on how small body masses can become , and ( iii ) a very soft constraint on large body masses in the form of increased extinction risk .",
    "phrased more conceptually , the left tail of the mammalian body mass distribution is mainly controlled by the lower limit on mass , while the right tail is the result of an evolutionary tradeoff at different timescales : over the short - term , within - lineage increases in body mass offer selective advantages such as better tolerance of resource fluctuations , better thermoregulation , better predator avoidance , etc .",
    "@xcite , while they also increase the long - term risk of extinction  a tradeoff previously identified in the more specific case of carnivorous mammals  @xcite .",
    "unlike mammals , data on most other taxonomic groups are generally not sufficient to yield accurate estimates of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( but see novack - gottshall and lanier  ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "the evolutionary history of mammalian body masses is relatively clear , in part because mammalian fossils are relatively plentiful , are often sufficiently well - preserved that body mass estimates can be made  @xcite , and the distribution of species body masses during an apparently stable evolutionary period is known .",
    "avian species , however , present an interesting case for study using our model : the distribution of extant avian body masses ( fig .",
    "[ fig : birds]a ) is relatively well characterized  @xcite and evidence of a minimum species body mass @xmath4 is reasonable  @xcite",
    ". however , the avian fossil record may be too sparse to yield accurate estimates of @xmath46 and @xmath47  @xcite .    even without estimates of @xmath46 and @xmath47 ,",
    "however , the diffusion model can be used to make quantitative statements about the general character of avian body mass evolution . to demonstrate this , we consider which combinations of the parameters @xmath58 produce `` realistic '' mass distributions , i.e. , those with a small distributional distance to the empirical distribution . in particular , we compute the wks distance between the model and the empirical data over the @xmath54-plane and determine the regions that yield the best fits . to illustrate this technique in a better understood context ,",
    "we first apply it to the data on recent terrestrial mammals , disregarding for the moment that we have an estimate of @xmath46 from fossil data .    ,",

    "title=\"fig : \" ]    the result of this exercise ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mammals]b ) shows that realistic mammalian mass distributions can be produced by a wide , but not arbitrary , variety of biases @xmath46 and extinction risks @xmath47 , including no bias at all , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "this degeneracy , which forms a groove in the @xmath54-plane following roughly @xmath60 with @xmath61 , suggests that part of the difficulty in determining for a particular taxon whether mass evolution is biased toward larger sizes or not ( see for example  @xcite ) is that a positive bias is not a necessary condition for the evolution of realistic mass distributions .",
    "indirect tests of the sign of @xmath46 , based either on the mass distribution within subclades  @xcite or on changes to minimum and maximum masses within a subclade over geologic time  @xcite may be adequate if confounding hypotheses can be eliminated or if an appropriate null model is available .",
    "on the other hand , the most accurate method remains the direct analysis of large amounts of ancestor - descendant data  @xcite , preferably when derived from as realistic a phylogeny as possible .",
    "an alternative approach , however , could use the systematic relationship between @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mammals]b ) to infer @xmath46 from an empirical estimate of @xmath47 .",
    "performing the same analysis with the birds data ( fig .  [",
    "fig : birds]b ) , we find that realistic avian mass distributions are also only produced by particular combinations of parameters , and also that the groove of minimum wks values follows a systematic relationship with the same basic form as that of terrestrial mammals ( fig  [ fig : mammals]b ) , i.e. , @xmath60 with @xmath61 . like mammals",
    ", this groove passes through the point @xmath55 , implying that this test can not rule out the possibility that cope s rule ( @xmath48 ) does not hold for the evolution of birds .",
    "however , there is an important qualitative difference between these two grooves : as a function of @xmath47 , the birds groove grows considerably slower than the mammals groove .",
    "this indicates that for a given diffusion bias @xmath46 , a significantly larger extinction parameter @xmath47 is required to produce a comparably realistic mass distribution . in other words , for a particular body mass @xmath0 , the risk of extinction for an avian species should be substantially higher than for a terrestrial mammal species of the same size .    finally , taking arbitrarily the case of no within - lineage bias and using the fitted value of @xmath47",
    ", we see that the predicted mass distribution for birds is generally in good agreement with the empirical data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : birds]a ) .",
    "the deviations in the left and right tails may make interesting objects for future study .",
    "for instance , the deviations in the left tail persist across the groove of minimum wks values , even for unrealistically large values of @xmath46 .",
    "this behavior lends some support to the hypothesis that the left tail s particular shape is caused by strong physiological constraints on body mass evolution near the avian lower limit  @xcite , which are not included in our model .",
    "additionally , the predicted right tail may fit better , with a slightly smaller estimate of @xmath47 , were recently extinct species included , such as the giant moa ( _ dinornis robustus _ , @xmath62 ) .",
    "with respect to birds , our analysis leads us to make several concrete predictions about their evolution . with terrestrial mammals , avian evolution near the lower limit @xmath4",
    "is highly constrained , but in ways that that differ to some degree from those faced by mammals near their lower limit .",
    "this implies that avian species evolving near this limit should , more often than not , leave larger descendants @xmath15 and that the strength of this tendency should increase strongly as @xmath10 .",
    "body masses of large avian species ( @xmath63 ) , like those for terrestrial mammals , are constrained mainly by extinction risks that increase progressively with body mass . and , species with a mass @xmath0 face a significantly greater long - term risk of extinction than do mammalian species of the same size .",
    "this difference in extinction risk is large enough that an avian species with a mass of roughly @xmath64 should experience an extinction risk comparable to that of a mammalian species roughly 100 times larger ( @xmath2 ) .    from a more conceptual perspective",
    ", the similarity of the results for extant birds and recent terrestrial mammals suggests that their evolutionary histories , in terms of the processes that govern the variation of species body sizes over evolutionary timescales , are fundamentally the same .",
    "the similarity of these distributions to those of other taxonomic groups suggests that this explanation may be universal , although further empirical work is necessary to substantiate this hypothesis .",
    "indeed , recent analyses of fossil data for dinosaurs  @xcite seems to support this view .    on the other hand , although the agreement of the simple diffusion - reaction model given in eq .",
    ", when appropriately parameterized , and the observed mass distributions of recent terrestrial mammals and extant birds is quite good , the model is obviously incomplete in many ways . in particular ,",
    "the number of small - bodied species for both mammals and birds is overestimated by the model , which is likely because we omitted the increased positive bias toward larger sizes identified by clauset and erwin .",
    "additionally , speciation and extinction events are assumed to be independent , and thus the model can not explain fluctuations in the mass distribution caused by phylogenetically correlated extinctions , where entire genera or niches are wiped out by ecological or environmental changes .",
    "we conclude by noting that the model s good agreement with data suggests that it may be a useful way to establish null - expectations in the study of general trends in body mass evolution ( much like diffusion models in population genetics  @xcite ) in the absence of factors such as inter - specific competition , population dynamics , geography , predation , etc .",
    "for instance , the fully time - dependent formulation in eq .   could be used to correctly determine the significance of statistical trends in body masses over evolutionary time  @xcite .",
    "additionally , given the strong correlations between body mass and other species characteristics , this model of body mass evolution may provide a way to unify certain aspects of ecology and evolution .",
