    "the charged lepton flavor violating ( clfv ) processes are known to provide important signals on physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the analysis of search for @xmath4 decays in the cosmic - ray muons by hincks and pontecorvo in 1947 @xcite has given the first upper limit on the branching ratio of clfv processes .",
    "since then , the upper limits of the branching ratios of clfv processes have been improved and now reach around the orders of @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "a unique feature of this process is that both photonic and contact leptonic interaction can be proved , and an experimentally clean signal is expected because the sum of the energies of two electrons is restricted to the muon mass minus the binding energy of the muon in a muonic atom .",

    "it was shown the decay rate increases with the atomic number @xmath2 as @xmath8 .",
    "therefore heavy muonic atoms would provide a great opportunity of clfv search .",
    "however , as is well known , the effects of the coulomb interaction is significant for the ordinary decay of bound muons in heavy nuclei @xcite . since the quantitative evaluation of the decay process is needed in order to disentangle the mechanism of clfv interaction , it is important to update the estimations of ref .",

    "on the other hand , two electrons with the energy of approximately a half of muon mass are emitted in the final state .",
    "the angular momentum of the each electrons is not limited in this process .",
