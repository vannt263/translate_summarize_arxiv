    "the vast majority of galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) host multiple stellar populations ( mps ) characterized by different abundance ratios of selected light elements ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) : some stars share the same light element abundance ratios measured in galactic field stars with similar metallicity , but a large fraction of the cluster population has enhanced n , na , and al and depleted c and o abundances .",
    "the patterns are not random , but anticorrelated variations of the pairs c - n and o - na are commonly observed .",
    "these are generally considered to arise from hot hydrogen burning in a previous generation of more massive stars , as asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite , fast - rotating massive stars @xcite , interacting massive binary stars @xcite , and/or super - massive stars @xcite .",
    "objects with standard composition are commonly denoted as first generation ( fg ) stars , and those with modified chemistry as second generation ( sg ) stars , although the assumption that they are formed in subsequent star formation episodes is sometimes questioned ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in a few gcs",
    "the sg / fg star ratio measured along the red giant branch ( rgb ) is observed to differ from that measured along the agb , with a substantial deficiency of sg stars within the agb population , compared to the rgb @xcite . in principle , this can be explained by taking into account that stars with evolving masses below @xmath0 are expected to fail reaching the agb phase ( the so - called _ agb - manqu _ stars ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) and sg stars are indeed expected to have a lower mass along the hb with respect to fg stars . in fact , since they are typically he - enhanced , they originate from rgb stars with a lower mass and end up , on average , with a lower mass along the hb , if the rgb mass loss is approximately the same for fg and sg sub - populations ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one therefore expects that the agb of gcs with a blue hb should lack at least part of the sg component , compared to what is seen along the rgb .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite , who empirically showed that the number ratio between agb and hb stars ( the @xmath1 parameter ) correlates with the hb morphology , in the sense that clusters with the bluest hb morphology have lower @xmath1 values .",
    "ngc 6752 is a metal - intermediate gc with an extreme blue hb morphology and a low @xmath1 value , and it is claimed to be the most extreme case of a gc lacking sg stars along the agb .",
    "in fact , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c13 ) measured the na abundance of 20 agb stars in this cluster and from the derived [ na / fe ] distribution , they concluded that all objects belong to the fg population . in their interpretation ,",
    "the sg stars fail to reach the agb phase because their hb progenitors are all located at effective temperatures ( @xmath2 ) hotter than the grundahl jump ( at @xmath311 500 k ) and experience a very strong mass loss ( a factor of 20 larger than that suffered along the rgb ) .",
    "an alternative solution has been proposed by @xcite , who argued that the lack of sg agb stars can be explained within the fast - rotating massive stars scenario by assuming very high he abundances ( up to @xmath40.7 ) for the sg objects , that therefore become _ agb - manqu _ stars . on the other hand , by using detailed synthetic hb simulations , @xcite were able to reproduce the star distribution along the hb of ngc 6752 and its observed @xmath1 value assuming the initial he - abundance distribution derived from the cluster main sequence ( @xmath5 between @xmath30.25 and@xmath30.27 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) without invoking any extreme hb mass loss or initial he enhancement .",
    "however , these simulations show that @xmath6 of the agb population should be composed of sg stars , at odds with the claim by c13 .    with the aim of solving this intriguing issue , here we present the chemical abundances of iron and several light elements that we recently determined from high - resolution spectra for the same sample of agb stars discussed in c13 .",
    "the 20 agb stars in ngc 6752 previously studied by c13 have been re - observed ( program 095.d-0320(a ) , pi : mucciarelli ) with the uves spectrograph @xcite mounted at the eso - very large telescope .",
    "we used the dichroic1 mode adopting the gratings 390 blue arm cd#2 and 580 red arm cd#3 with the 1 arcsec slit ( r=  40000 ) .",
    "exposure times range from @xmath310 min for the brightest targets to @xmath325 min for the faintest ones , to obtain pixel signal - to - noise ratios higher than 100 .",
    "the data reduction was performed by using the dedicated eso pipeline , including bias subtraction , flat fielding , wavelength calibration , spectral extraction and order merging .",
    "the chemical analysis has been performed following the same procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the stellar atmospheric parameters have been derived as follows : + ( 1 )  @xmath2 have been derived spectroscopically by requiring no trend between iron abundances and excitation potentials ; + ( 2 )  surface gravities ( log@xmath7 ) have been obtained through the stefan - boltzmann relation , adopting the spectroscopic @xmath2 , the distance modulus ( @xmath8)@xmath9 = 13.13 and color excess e(@xmath10 ) = 0.04 @xcite , and a mass of 0.61 m@xmath11 , according to the median value of the hb mass range estimated by @xcite0.55 m@xmath11 ) median mass .",
    "the adoption of this value decreases log  g by @xmath30.04 , with a negligible impact on the abundances , @xmath30.02 for [ feii / h ] and smaller than 0.01 dex for the other species . ] .",
    "stellar luminosities have been calculated using the bolometric corrections by @xcite and the @xmath12-band magnitudes from the ground - based photometric catalog reduced and calibrated following the procedures described in @xcite ; + ( 3 ) microturbulent velocities ( v@xmath13 ) have been obtained by requiring no trend between iron abundances and line strengths .",
    "the derived values of @xmath2 and v@xmath13 well agree with those by c13 , with average differences @xmath14 = @xmath15 k and @xmath16 = @xmath17 km s@xmath18 .",
    "for log@xmath7 there is a systematic difference @xmath19 = @xmath20 dex , probably due to the different distance modulus and the larger stellar mass adopted by c13 .",
    "the abundances of fe , na , mg , and al have been derived using the classical method of the equivalent widths ( ew ) with the package gala @xcite .",
    "ews have been measured by means of the daospec package @xcite , iteratively launched with the code 4dao@xcite .",
    "the linelist was built using a synthetic reference spectrum calculated at the uves resolution and selecting only transitions predicted to be unblended .",
    "we adopted the atomic data of the last release of the kurucz / castelli compilation for all species except for feii lines , which have been taken from @xcite .",
    "the adopted model atmospheres have been computed with the atlas9 code adopting a global metallicity of [ m / h ] = @xmath21 dex .",
    "the abundances of na have been corrected for nlte effects according to @xcite and consistently with the analysis of c13 . for 7 stars",
    "the al lines at 6696 - 6698@xmath22 are too weak to be detected and only upper limits can be obtained .",
    "the abundances of c , n and o have been measured through the spectral synthesis technique , using the forbidden oxygen line at 6300@xmath22 , and the ch and cn molecular bands at 4300@xmath22 and 3880@xmath22 , respectively . to derive the abundance of n we have taken into account the abundance of carbon measured from the ch band , while for the o abundance we adopted the average c and n abundances thus obtained , together with the measured abundance of ni .",
    "this was done to take into account the close blending of the o line at 6300@xmath22 with a ni transition .",
    "we also checked that the o transition is free from telluric contamination in 19 out of 20 agb stars .",
    "for the star 1620 the contamination is severe and we did not derive the o abundance .    as reference solar abundances we assumed those of @xcite except for c , n and o , for which we assumed the values of @xcite .",
    "the computation of the final abundance uncertainties adds in quadrature two terms .",
    "the first is the error arising from spectral features measurements .",
    "for the abundances derived from ews , this term is obtained for each star by dividing the line - to - line dispersion by the square root of the number of lines used . for the elements analyzed with spectral synthesis",
    ", the fitting procedure is repeated for a sample of 500 synthetic spectra where poissonian noise has been injected to reproduce the noise conditions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the second term is the abundance error arising from atmospheric parameters .",
    "this has been computed by varying each parameter by its 1@xmath23 uncertainty obtained in the analysis . due to the quality of the spectra we found that the typical internal uncertainties for @xmath2 are lower than @xmath335k , while for log  @xmath24 and v@xmath13 we found values lower than 0.1 dex and 0.05 km s@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the derived iron abundance ratios are listed in table [ tab1 ] together with the stellar atmospheric parameters .",
    "we obtain average [ fei / h ] = @xmath25 dex ( @xmath23 = 0.05 dex ) and [ feii / h ] = @xmath26 dex ( @xmath23 = 0.02 dex ) .",
    "the average [ feii / h ] abundance is consistent with the values measured in rgb stars by @xcite , while [ fei / h ] is 0.22 dex lower than the metallicity inferred from fe  ii lines .",
    "such a discrepancy between [ fei / h ] and [ feii / h ] among agb stars is too large to be explained within internal uncertainties and has been observed previously in other gcs @xcite .",
    "the same [ fei / h]-[feii / h ] discrepancy remains also if we adopt the atmospheric parameters quoted in c13 .",
    "note that c13 do not measure directly the fe abundance , but assume the average rgb [ fe / h ] by @xcite for all the targets . with their atmospheric parameters",
    "we derive [ fei / h]=@xmath271.77@xmath280.01 dex ( @xmath23=  0.05 dex ) and [ feii / h]=@xmath271.50@xmath280.01 dex ( @xmath23=  0.02 dex ) .",
    "even if a complete explanation of this effect is still lacking , this _ iron discrepancy _ seems to be a general feature of agb stars in gcs .",
    "significant inhomogeneities in the light element abundances of the studied agb stars are immediately apparent already from the visual inspection of the acquired spectra .",
    "this can be appreciated in figure [ spectra ] , where the ch and cn molecular bands , and o , na , mg and al lines of star 44 and star 65 ( having very similar atmospheric parameters ; see table [ tab1 ] ) are compared .",
    "apart from mg , notable differences in the line strength are well visible for all the other elements .",
    "moreover , the strength of the c and o features appears to anticorrelate with the strength of the n and na lines .",
    "this clearly shows that the two stars are highly inhomogeneous in their light element content .",
    "the abundance ratios obtained for the entire agb sample are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "following the approach discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the abundance ratios have been computed by adopting [ fei / h ] as reference but for o , for which we used [ feii / h ] .",
    "this method provides the best agreement between the abundance ratios in agb and rgb stars of the same cluster .",
    "however , because the origin of the fei - feii discrepancy is still unclear , we will discuss the abundances of agb stars with respect to both hydrogen and iron , to ensure that our results are independent of the adopted normalization of the abundance ratios . with the only exception of mg , for which we find values confined within a narrow range , the abundances of all the other light elements show dispersions well exceeding the internal errors ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this is true not only for the abundance ratios referred to iron , but it also holds for normalizations to hydrogen .",
    "in particular , the measured sodium abundances span a range @xmath29[na / fe]@xmath30[na / h]@xmath31 , for nitrogen we find @xmath29[n / fe]@xmath30[n / h]@xmath32 , and for oxygen we obtain @xmath29[o / fe]@xmath30[o / h]@xmath33 .",
    "the detected inhomogeneities also appear to be mutually correlated .",
    "in fact , figure [ el_corr ] shows clear c - n and o - na anticorrelations , and n - na and na - al correlations , both if we consider the abundance ratios referred to fe , and if we normalize to h. in all cases , the statistical significance , as measured by the spearman rank coefficients @xmath34 , is very high ( values of @xmath34 larger than 0.74 corresponds to non - correlation probabilities lower than @xmath35 ) . in these diagrams , star 44 and star 65 ( see figure [ spectra ] ) reside at two opposite ends , the former being c and o - rich and n , na , al - poor , while star 65 showing a specular pattern .",
    "the existence of such well - defined correlations , by itself , indicates the presence of multiple sub - populations along the agb of ngc 6752 . by definition , in fact , a sample composed exclusively of fg stars ( as suggested by c13 ) would display homogeneous abundances and produce no correlations .",
    "indeed , the detected correlations are perfectly in agreement with those commonly ascribed to fg and sg sub - populations in gcs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ nao ] shows the agb population ( solid blue circles ) of ngc 6752 in the `` standard '' [ na / fe]-[o / fe ] plane . for reference",
    ", we also plot the results obtained for the rgb population of ngc 6752 ( empty red squares , from @xcite ) and several rgb samples in 19 gcs ( gray dots , from @xcite ) .",
    "the agb population of ngc 6752 clearly outlines and follows the anti - correlation stream defined by the rgb samples , thus confirming the existence of sg agb stars in ngc 6752 . to better characterize the cluster sub - populations , in figure [ nao ] we also plot three ellipses corresponding to the values of [ na / fe ] and [ o / fe ] that @xcite , on the basis of their photometric study and the chemical abundances measured by @xcite , associate to the fg , sg and extreme - sg sub - samples in ngc 6752 ( `` populations a , b , and c '' in their nomenclature",
    "; see figure 15 in @xcite ) .",
    "notably , the abundances here determined for the agb population nicely match the fg and sg loci , thus demonstrating that , at odds with the claim by c13 , also sg stars do experience the agb phase in ngc 6752 .",
    "in particular , based on table 1 and figure [ nao ] , we count 13 ( out of 20 ) sg stars , corresponding to @xmath36 of the total agb sample here investigated .",
    "following @xcite , the fg stars in ngc 6752 have standard chemical mixture ( @xmath37 ) , sg stars have moderate enhancement of [ na / fe ] and he ( @xmath38 ) , and a mild depletion of [ o / fe ] , and extreme - sg stars have high [ na / fe ] and he ( @xmath39 ) , and low [ o / fe ] .",
    "our results show that the agb sample is composed of the first two populations only , while the extreme - sg stars are not observed .",
    "nicely , the sg/(fg+sg ) fraction estimated photometrically by @xcite is @xmath40 , in very good agreement with the value ( 65% ) found here .",
    "the lack of the extreme - sg stars along the agb is exactly what the synthetic hb simulations by @xcite predict .",
    "these simulations consider three stellar populations with initial he abundances equal to those quoted by @xcite , and they are able to well reproduce the observed value of the @xmath1 parameter and the hb morphology , magnitude and color distribution , without invoking exceptional mass loss during the hb phase .",
    "they predict that the extreme - sg is the most he - rich population , which populates the bluer end of the hb and produces _ agb - manqu _ objects .",
    "also the observed fraction of fg agb stars ( 35% of the total ) is consistent , within the statistical fluctuations due to the small size of the sample , with the predictions ( @xmath6 ) of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observed fraction of failed agb stars in ngc 6752 can be easily explained within the standard stellar evolution framework , with no need of invoking exceptional mass loss for hb stars hotter than the grundahl jump ( c13 ) , or extremely high ( and inconsistent with the photometric constraints from the main sequence ) initial he abundances for the sg population @xcite .",
    "the results presented here provide firm evidence that the agb population of ngc 6752 includes both fg and sg stars .",
    "while this is in line with similar results obtained from both spectroscopic @xcite and photometric @xcite observations in various gcs , it is in contrast with the findings of c13 .",
    "although a detailed discussion of the origin of the discrepancy with the result by c13 is beyond the scope of this letter , a preliminary comparison between the two samples demonstrates that there is a systematic offset ( @xmath29[na / fe ] @xmath3 0.25 dex ) between the values of [ na / fe ] measured here and those measured by c13 .",
    "this is the main reason why while we count at least 11 stars above [ na / fe ] = 0.18 dex ( the threshold adopted by c13 ) , no stars were found by c13 . on the other hand the clear anticorrelations shown in fig .",
    "[ el_corr ] for the entire set of light elements , clearly indicated the existence of sg stars along the agb of ngc6752 , thus demonstrating that the chemical analysis of a single light element does not allow to draw reliable conclusions about the presence or lack of sg populations .",
    "indeed , the adoption of the classical scheme based on the analysis of light element ( anti)correlations , appears to be the most appropriate spectroscopic way to detect and distinguish fg and sg stars .     as a function of [ o / fe ] for the agb ( filled blue circles , this work ) and rgb stars ( open red squares *",
    "* ) of ngc  6752 .",
    "the results obtained for rgb stars in other gcs @xcite , rescaled to the solar values adopted in this work , are shown as gray dots for reference .",
    "the regions corresponding to the three populations identified by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 15 ) are encircled . ]",

    "<S> we derived chemical abundances for c , n , o , na , mg and al in 20 asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in the globular cluster ngc 6752 . all these elements ( but mg ) </S>",
    "<S> show intrinsic star - to - star variations and statistically significant correlations or anticorrelations analogous to those commonly observed in red giant stars of globular clusters hosting multiple populations . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that , at odds with previous findings , both first and second generation stars populate the agb of ngc 6752 . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with the na abundances of red giant branch stars in the same cluster reveals that second generation stars ( with mild na and he enrichment ) do reach the agb phase . </S>",
    "<S> the only objects that are not observed along the agb of ngc 6752 are stars with extreme na enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> this is also consistent with standard stellar evolution models , showing that highly na and he enriched stars populate the bluest portion of the horizontal branch and , because of their low stellar masses , evolve directly to the white dwarf cooling sequence , skipping the agb phase . </S>"
