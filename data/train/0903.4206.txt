    "the aforementioned bias likely affects the determination of the scale height by other means .",
    "the total number of classical cepheids in the galaxy is estimated to be on the order of @xmath78 .",
    "cepheid variables and young open clusters concentrate in obvious and consistent patterns typical of local spiral arms . the inferred picture of such features both supports and contradicts existing interpretations .",
    "the sagittarius - carina arm is confirmed as a major spiral arm that appears to originate from a different galactic region than suggested previously .",
    "a major feature is also concentrated in cygnus - vulpecula and may continue locally near the sun into the third quadrant , possibly extending into the puppis associations . more work is needed to complete the picture , however .",
    "short - period classical cepheids are shown to be as useful as long - period cepheids as tracers , indicating that stars born in spiral arms remain close to their places of origin for at least @xmath79 myr .",
    "the future _ gaia _ mission @xcite , a next generation follow - up to the _ hipparcos _ mission , should detect a large sample of new cepheids that may help to elucidate the milky way s structure , in addition to the discoveries of new galactic open clusters @xcite .",
    "indeed , a multifaceted approach will likely be needed to clarify the presently available evidence pertaining to the sun s location relative to the main components of the galaxy . the present study appears to support the historic tradition of utilizing cepheid variables in such an endeavour .",
    "we are indebted to leonid berdnikov , laszlo szabados , and the staff of ogle , whose comprehensive work on cepheid variables was invaluable to our analysis , doug welch ( mcmaster cepheid archive ) , michael sallman ( tass ) , grzegorz pojmanski ( asas ) , arne henden and michael saladyga ( aavso ) , brent miszalski ( mash ) , alison doane ( hco ) , carolyn stern grant ( ads ) , and the folks at cds .",
    "reviews by @xcite , @xcite , anton pannekoek , and david higgins , were useful in the preparation of this work .",

    "<S> classical and type ii cepheids are used to reinvestigate specific properties of the galaxy . a new type ii reddening - free cepheid distance parameterization is formulated from lmc cepheids ( ogle ) , with uncertainties typically no larger than 515% . a distance to the galactic centre of @xmath0 kpc is derived from the median distance to type ii cepheids in the bulge ( ogle ) , @xmath1 kpc from a distance to the near side of the bulge combined with an estimated bulge radius of @xmath2 kpc derived from planetary nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> the distance of the sun from the galactic plane inferred from classical cepheid variables is @xmath3 pc , a result dependent on the sample s distance and direction because of the complicating effects of gould s belt and warping in the galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> classical cepheids and young open clusters delineate consistent and obvious spiral features , although their characteristics do not match conventional pictures of the galaxy s spiral pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the sagittarius - carina arm is confirmed as a major spiral arm that appears to originate from a different galactic region than suggested previously . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a major feature is observed to emanate from cygnus - vulpecula and may continue locally near the sun . </S>",
    "<S> significant concerns related to the effects of metallicity on the _ vi_-based reddening - free cepheid distance relations used here are allayed by demonstrating that the computed distances to the galactic centre , and to several globular clusters ( m54 , ngc 6441 , m15 , and m5 ) and galaxies ( ngc 5128 and ngc 3198 ) which likely host type ii cepheids : agree with literature results to within the uncertainties . an additional empirical test is proposed to constrain any putative metallicity dependence of cepheid distance determinations through forced matches of distance estimates to a particular galaxy using both type ii and classical cepheids .    </S>",
