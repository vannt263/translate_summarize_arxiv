    "it is plausible that two years from now the lhc will have collected up to @xmath2 of data in its @xmath3 tev running . among other interesting searches ,",
    "the one focusing on the higgs boson seems to be very promising , since the last projections show an exclusion potential up to a mass of @xmath4 gev for a scalar with the same couplings as the standard model ( sm ) higgs @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it makes sense to ask : what if the lhc does not find anything ? does it means that the higgs paradigm for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is ruled out ?",
    "+ of course the answer is negative , since in many motivated extensions of the sm the lightest scalar of the theory can have very different properties with respect to the sm higgs particle ( different mass and different couplings , affecting both the production cross section and the decay modes ) .",
    "+ in this work we focus on a particular supersymmetric framework , named @xmath0susy @xcite , in which one additional coupling between the two higgs bosons and a singlet @xmath5 of the sm gauge group , @xmath6 , is added to the superpotential in order to raise the higgs boson mass above the lep ii experimental limit @xcite without relying on radiative corrections .",
    "a large coupling @xmath0 at low energies allows to increase the higgs boson mass already at tree level , in such a way that the well known problem of the mssm higgs boson mass with the lep lower bound is easily satisfied and also naturalness is improved @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we analyse a different superpotential with respect to the one studied previously in @xcite , namely the nmssm scale invariant superpotential @xmath7 , which is particularly interesting since it allows to solve the so called @xmath8 problem of the mssm . indeed in this case",
    "the charged higgsino mass term results @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the singlet , that arises thus from the dynamical ewsb .",
    "+ the nmssm has been widely analysed in the literature ( for comprehensive reviews and for lists of references , see @xcite ) , considering usually the case in which @xmath0 is relatively small ( @xmath11 , in order to be compatible with semiperturbativity up to the gut scale ) . in this case",
    "the model has some very interesting features : first of all , the lightest scalar does not need to satisfy the lep bound , as long as its singlet component is sizeable ( in fact its mass can be in the @xmath12 gev range ) .",
    "this can cause the di - photon rate of the lightest higgs particle to be a factor of @xmath13 higher than the sm one due to the reduced couplings to the bottom quark , depending on the various parameters @xcite-@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it seems that in most of the parameter space the most important decay mode of the lightest scalar particle is into a pair of light psudoscalars , so that the possibility of probing the nmssm parameter space relies mainly on the ability to analyse the decays of these light pseudoscalars .",
    "several dedicated studies can be found in the literature ( among the others , @xcite-@xcite-@xcite ) in which it has been shown that with an high integrated luminosity ( probably of the order of @xmath14 ) this decay mode can be properly analysed .",
    "very recently @xcite , it has been pointed out that a @xmath15 mixing ( where @xmath16 is the lightest pseudoscalar ) can represent an efficient way to suppress the @xmath17 decay ( with @xmath18 the lightest scalar ) given an @xmath16 mass in the range @xmath19 gev .",
    "+ in contrast , in the early works about @xmath0susy @xcite , in addition to the increased higgs boson mass ( up to about @xmath1 gev ) , a decoupled singlet allows to have a heavier scalar with the usual couplings of the mssm higgs boson : this was possible at all by suitably choosing the mass term @xmath20 in the superpotential .",
    "moreover , due to the largish @xmath0 , the effects of the virtual higgs bosons exchange on the @xmath21 parameter are positive and automatically of the right size to compensate for the growth of both @xmath21 and @xmath22 due to the heavier mass , so that there is agreement with the electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) for values of @xmath23 not too far from unity .",
    "+ in this work , based on a scale invariant superpotential , we consider a framework which is somehow intermediate . on the one hand",
    "we satisfy the lep bound raising the higgs boson mass up to values around @xmath1 gev already at tree level using a large @xmath0 ; on the other hand , since it is no longer true in general that the singlet can be decoupled , the lightest scalar will not simply be an heavier mssm higgs boson but will have some distinctive features of the nmssm scalars .",
    "as already stated , the model we want to consider has the same structure as the nmssm ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in order to fix the notation , we now briefly describe its structure .",
    "+ the scale invariant model is defined by the following superpotential ( that does not contain any dimensionful parameter , in contrast to the superpotential of the mssm ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a gauge singlet and @xmath26 the usual higgs boson fields . the corresponding scalars are defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath10 are the vevs of the two higgs boson and of the singlet , respectively . + the scalar potential is then given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 for simplicity in what follows we will always assume all the parameters real .",
    "+ the striking feature of our framework is the largish value of @xmath0 compared to the usual nmssm case , that allows us to increase the higgs boson mass already at tree level acting on the f - term of the potential . solving the relevant rge for @xmath0 and @xmath31 @xcite",
    ", one finds that , insisting in keeping perturbativity up to at least @xmath32 tev , at the low energy scale we must have @xcite @xmath33 in contrast to @xmath34 following from the requirement of perturbativity up to the gut scale .",
    "we will discuss later the sign of the relevant parameters .",
    "+ since the tree level upper bound on the higgs mass is now @xcite-@xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : mass ] for a brief discussion of the mass matrices ) @xmath35 it is clear that for high values of the @xmath0 coupling the higgs boson mass can easily be raised at the level of @xmath36 gev , so that from now on we will use @xmath37 . + we will now discuss all the relevant constraints that we have to impose in order to find the allowed region in parameter space , namely the stability of the potential , conservation of electromagnetism , absence of spontaneous cp violation and absence of unrealistic minima .      as usual in the nmssm the potential is always stable , while the condition of unbroken electromagnetism is @xmath38 the issue of spontaneous cp violation has to be treated carefully , since the requirement of real parameters does not imply cp conservation in the scalar sector .",
    "this follows from the fact that while with an @xmath39 transformation we can always set @xmath40 , in general both @xmath41 and @xmath10 are complex parameters ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "we thus want @xmath44 to be an absolute minimum .",
    "the only part of the neutral scalar potential that depends on the two phases is the one trilinear in the scalar fields : @xmath45 which follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tot_pot])-([eq : pot_parts ] ) after the insertion of the complex vevs .",
    "+ from the matrix of second derivatives one obtains the conditions for @xmath44 to be a local minimum : @xmath46 although it can be shown that non trivial extremal points exists , these points are always local maxima @xcite . depending on the signs of the parameters involved , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cp ] ) we can summarize the situation as follows @xcite :    * if @xmath47 and @xmath48 , then @xmath44 is always a minimum ; * if @xmath47 and @xmath49 then @xmath44 is a minimum if @xmath50 and the denominator is positive ; * if @xmath47 and @xmath51 then @xmath44 is a minimum if @xmath52 ; * if @xmath53 and @xmath51 then @xmath44 is a minimum if @xmath54 and a positive denominator ;    comparing now the point @xmath44 with @xmath55 , it is easy to show that in the cases previously listed @xmath44 is always an absolute minimum and not only a local minimum . + it is useful to analyse if all the signs of the parameters are physical or if we can fix some of them . to this end",
    ", we notice that the neutral part of the potential is invariant under the transformations @xmath56 this allow us to fix the sign of @xmath0 and @xmath41 , but not those of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath10 and @xmath31 that are thus physical .",
    "in what follows we will always choose @xmath59 ( and @xmath40 as already said ) .",

    "with the lhc machine taking data and with the promising projection of a higgs boson discovery potential up to a mass of @xmath4 gev with an integrated luminosity of @xmath2 , it is interesting to consider what happens in models in which the higgs boson is non standard . in this work we focused on the @xmath0susy framework , in which the higgs boson mass is raised already at tree level in order to satisfy the lep bound without relying on radiative corrections . for definitiveness",
    ", we studied the particular case of a scale invariant superpotential , in contrast to was what done in @xcite .",
    "+ the difference between the two cases is evident : while the lightest scalar in @xcite is essentially an heavier standard higgs boson , since both the production rate and the branching ratio into gauge bosons are approximately the standard ones , the one in the scale invariant case have a very different behaviour , especially in the production rate .",
    "indeed , while there are regions in parameter space in which the decays are dominated by those into gauge bosons , the production rate from gluon gluon fusion is always reduced at least of the @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , we saw that whenever the @xmath61 and @xmath62 decay modes are open they dominate over all the other channels . while in the first case we have to deal with an invisible decay mode , the higgs search of the lightest scalar via the cascade @xmath63 seems to be viable with an integrated luminosity of @xmath14 @xcite , unfortunately surely out of the reach of the first lhc run .",
