    "future high energy @xmath7 colliders @xcite are likely to make available the possibility to operate also in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mode @xcite",
    ". this last mode will allow the experimental study of the bosonic sector of the electroweak lagrangian @xcite , triple and quartic gauge boson couplings as well as the coupling of gauge bosons with the higgs particle if it is light enough to be produced .",
    "the most abundant final state to be studied will be w pair production .",
    "this process is allowed at the tree level and , since the production rate is dominated by @xmath10 channel virtual w exchange , the cross section becomes nearly constant for a center of mass energy above @xmath11 gev . with the aimed luminosity in the range of @xmath12 inverse femtobarns per year about one millions of w pairs per year are expected .    because of the high statistic and of the relatively clean environment provided by a leptonic collider , a good accuracy in the theoretical prediction will be necessary .",
    "since the w boson is shortlived , the experimental signature for w pair production is via its decay products , mostly four fermions in the final state . therefore one has to compute the rate for the process @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    "i compute , at tree level , the rate for the process |_e e^- u |d [ pro ] discussing in some detail the comparison with the _ narrow width _ approximation and with the calculation which includes only the contribution of the subset of doubly resonant diagrams .",
    "i carry on the comparison both at the level of total cross section and of differential distributions .",
    "the amplitude for the process ( [ pro ] ) is computed using a new technique which , in collaboration with _ f. caravaglios _",
    "@xcite , i have recently developed . exploiting the relation between the one - particle irreducible green functions generator @xmath14 and the connected green functions generator @xmath15 we have proposed a simple numerical algorithm to compute tree level scattering amplitudes . we have then implemented the algorithm in a fortran code alpha which presently uses the standard electroweak lagrangian ( qcd is not included yet ) and can compute any scattering amplitude in this framework , in a fully automatic way .",
    "we have used the alpha code to obtain the rates for the processes @xmath7 _ into four fermions _ which are of relevance for the lep200 experiments and our results are in complete agreement , within the statistical error of the montecarlo integration ( typically less than one per mille ) , with the results obtained using more conventional methods @xcite .",
    "this provides the most stringent test of our algorithm and of our code : it is important to stress here that the calculation of the matrix element of any of these processes is entirely automatic ; to study a different process we had to change only an input file specifying the type and number of particles involved .",
    "the input values , which will be used in the present paper , for particles masses , widths and for the electroweak coupling constants are reported in table [ ew ] .",
    "the running width scheme is used , namely the w propagator @xmath16 is taken as _",
    "w^ = [ rw ] where @xmath17 is the w four momentum , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the w mass and width respectively , and @xmath20 is the riemann @xmath21 function : it is equal to one for positive @xmath22 and zero otherwise .",
    "input parameters for the electroweak lagrangian .",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the electron @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks masses respectively , @xmath18 and @xmath19 the w mass and width , @xmath28 is the weinberg angle and @xmath29 is the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "tree level relationships among the parameters of the standard model electroweak lagrangian are assumed . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as it stands the calculation that i have presented is not gauge invariant .",
    "the reason is that the introduction of a finite and running w width as in ( [ rw ] ) explicitly breaks gauge invariance .",
    "several strategies have been proposed to restore gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "the most satisfactory appears to be the one inspired by field theoretical arguments , namely the inclusion in the input lagrangian of the one loop contribution of fermion loops to the imaginary part of the gauge bosons self couplings @xcite .",
    "however , although straightforward , this strategy is a bit cumbersome to be implemented since it requires the introduction of complicated form factors which considerably slow down the computational speed .",
    "therefore to study the quantitative impact of the breaking of the gauge invariance induced by ( [ rw ] ) i have used a trick to restore gauge invariance which is easier to implement and does not affect computational time , the so called _ fudge _ @xcite scheme , namely one first computes the matrix element with zero w width and therefore in a fully gauge invariant way , and only at the very end multiplies the result for a common factor @xmath30 , _ fdg= [ lfdg ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 being the neutrino , electron , @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks four momenta respectively .",
    "the disadvantage of this scheme is that it grossly mistreats the non resonant contribution as well as resonant non - resonant interference when @xmath37 or @xmath38 are close to the w mass .",
    "however in view of the good agreement between the resonant and the full calculation when invariant mass cuts are applied one can hope that this does not induce sizable errors .",
    "the results are displayed in table [ tggcut ] and in figg .",
    "when angular cuts are applied , no appreciable difference with respect to the full calculation in the running width scheme is observed thus suggesting that the breaking of the gauge invariance from ( [ rw ] ) does not affect the numerical results in an important way .",
    "if no cut is applied a small difference appears and it is not possible to determine , at this level , whether this is due to the already mentioned caveats of the _ fudge _ scheme or to the gauge violation effect .",
    "ultimately one has to perform the calculation in the most appropriate way using the best gauge restoration scheme which is available , however the shown comparison suggests that , to study the experimental data , it is possible to use a computation with the explicit breaking of the gauge invariance ( [ rw ] ) and only at the very end of the analysis to check the results with a theoretically more satisfactory calculation .",
    "i have addressed the calculation of the process @xmath39 at the tree - level by means of the alpha code .",
    "the rate is dominated by w pairs production and decay and a sizable contribution comes also from the exchange of an almost on shell @xmath10 channel virtual charged fermions ( always linked to the emission of a charged fermions collinear to the incoming photons ) . at the high center of mass energies ( @xmath40 tev ) typical of future linear colliders",
    "the w bosons are boosted in the laboratory frame and , since they are produced mainly in the beam direction because of the dominant contribution from @xmath10 channel virtual w exchange , also their decay products are emitted mainly along the beam direction .",
    "the result of the full calculations exhibits important differencies with respect to the _ narrow width _",
    "approximation ( see ( [ ww ] ) ) which has been used up to now in the discussion in the literature .",
    "there is an important dependence on the cuts on the invariant mass of the reconstructed w : requiring this mass to be within a 5 , 10 and 18 gev interval of the measured w mass one obtains differencies of about 16 % and 24 % for the total rate . also the approximation based on the subset of doubly resonant diagrams appears in general to be unsatisfactory leading to discrepancies larger than 10 % .",
    "however when _ both _ invariant mass and angular cuts are applied ( this is impossible for purely leptonic final states ) the complete calculation and the the contribution of doubly resonant diagrams only are much closer to each other .",
    "a final remark is in order here : although the computation has been presented for a fixed center of mass energy it is a straightforward matter to allow for a variable energy for the colliding photons and therefore the whole calculation can easily be adapted to become an event generator for the future @xmath9 collider .      99 , desy 92 - 123b , ed .  p.  zerwas",
