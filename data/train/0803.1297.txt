    "there has been much attention to the molecular bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) which is a versatile playground not only for cold atomic physics experiments but also for other research areas , such as condensed matter theory as well as quantum field theory .",
    "it is no longer a pure bose system as the molecular bec can be a system of bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "this makes the theoretical structure rich and colorful . to realize the molecular bec , one must create stable molecules with long lifetime . in the recent experiments  @xcite , the technique of feshbach resonance plays an important role in the creation of molecules . since the molecules created through such a technique usually suffer from fast decay due to the vibrational excitation , the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) in photoassociation  @xcite has been regarded as an effective approach to create ground - state molecules .",
    "the success of stirap technique requires the existence of a coherent population trapping ( cpt ) state which can be followed adiabatically  @xcite .",
    "such a condition can be fulfilled for linear @xmath2 systems by appropriately choosing laser frequencies . however , for the system with inter - particle interactions , the two - photon resonance condition dynamically changes when population is transferred from atomic states to molecular states .",
    "this makes the cpt state more difficult to be followed adiabatically .",
    "the adiabatic property was studied by means of adiabatic fidelity in a recent theoretical work  @xcite for a simplified model of monoatomic system without inter - particle interaction .",
    "it is worthwhile to appropriately define the adiabatic fidelity to study the adiabatic property for a more realistic system , such as the diatomic system which has been realized in serval experiments  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider systems consisting of fermionic atoms in different hyperfine states and their compounded molecules coupled through the stirap technique aided by feshbach resonance .",
    "we discuss systems of @xmath0li and @xmath1k as concrete examples . in section  [ sec : general ] , we model the systems with inter - particle interaction and derive the dynamical equations for them .",
    "we make a general consideration on the symmetry and the relevant conservation law , and then introduce the definition of fidelity for our system . in section  [ sec",
    ": cpt - state ] , we look for solutions of the cpt state . in section  [ sec : efficiency ] , we calculate the conversion efficiency for @xmath1k atoms and @xmath0li atoms , respectively , and discuss the corresponding features . in section  [ sec : fidelity ] , we study the relation between the atom - to - molecule conversion efficiency and the adiabatic fidelity for cpt state .",
    "we also study the effect of the decay of quansibound molecules and compare the difference between @xmath1k and @xmath0li systems .",
    "our results are briefly summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider that two species of fermionic atoms are converted into stable molecules via the stirap technique aided by feshbach resonance . here",
    "we use @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for the states of the free atoms in the open channel , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the quasibound and ground molecular states in the close channel , respectively .",
    "a pair of ferimonic atoms are coupled with the quasibound molecular state @xmath5 through a feshbach resonance , where the coupling strength is denoted by @xmath7 and the detuning by @xmath8 .",
    "additionally , the sates @xmath5 and @xmath6 are coupled with each other through a laser field with the coupling strength @xmath9 and detuning @xmath10 .",
    "since the system is a fermi - bose mixture whose hilbert space actually carries out the representation of a graded unitary group su@xmath11 , it will be an arduous work to study the dynamics of the system by means of the heisenberg equation of motion . whereas , with the help of mean - field langrange density  @xcite , one can investigate the dynamics conveniently , @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the kinetic energy term of the @xmath14th component and @xmath15 . here",
    "the coefficients @xmath16 are the interaction strengths between particles with @xmath17 being the reduced mass and @xmath18 the @xmath19-wave scattering length .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq : lag ] ) is no more invariant under a simultaneous global phase transformation due to the presence of the atom - to - molecule conversion term . as the lagrangian does not include the term flipping the two fermionic components into each other , their corresponding phase parameters are not necessarily the same in general .",
    "one can find that the lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) is invariant under the phase transformation , @xmath20 with @xmath21    following the formulism of noether theorem , we evaluate the variation of the action caused by the infinitesimal phase transformation @xmath22 , @xmath23 for simplicity in the above expression , we omitted the subscripts of @xmath24 labelling different components , abbreviated @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 with @xmath29 . because of , explicitly , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and their complex conjugations , we derive the following result , @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 the system is invariant under the transformation eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) such that @xmath37 , which gives rise to two conserved currents .",
    "@xmath38    in the present paper , we focus on uniform system ( @xmath39 ) and hence neglect the kinetic and trapping potential terms",
    ". then the conservation law eq .",
    "( [ eq : conserved - currents ] ) reads @xmath40 , @xmath41 , which implies that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are determined by @xmath44 , the volume of the system , together with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the initial numbers of species @xmath47 and @xmath48 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "here we assume there are no molecules at the initial time in the system .    to guarantee the compatibility with the constraints given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraints ] ) , we introduce two lagrange multipliers @xmath51 and @xmath52 into the mean - field lagrange density eq .",

    "now we are in the position to introduce a proper definition of fidelity for our system .",
    "as our system is a four - component system of bose - fermi mixture which is related to a graded unitary group su@xmath11 , we need to define the fidelity carefully as it must obey several basic properties  @xcite . equation ( [ eq : constraint - redef ] ) actually provides us the normalization condition @xmath68 which can be expressed as the following form @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes @xmath71 .",
    "one might think of a naive expression for the @xmath72-matrix , @xmath73 .",
    "however , because the relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : normalization ] ) should be invariant under the transformation given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) , just like that the conventional inner product in quantum mechanics is invariant under the u(1 ) transformation , the simplest correct expression of the @xmath72-matrix ought to be @xmath74 as a result , a nature definition of fidelity of a state labelled by @xmath63 with that labelled by @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 where the @xmath72-matrix was given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "clearly , such a definition fulfills @xmath77 , which means the phase transformation given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) does not vary the magnitude of fidelity ; and the fidelity of a state with itself is always the unit @xmath78 which is just the normalization condition .",
    "now we consider the stationary states where we neglect the decay of quasibound molecules ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath79 ) .",
    "we know that the existence of stationary solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : de ] ) requires the system satisfies the adiabatic approximation condition . once the adiabatic approximation is valid , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath80 , the time - evolution equations ( [ eq : de ] ) become algebraic ones for @xmath63 s , namely , @xmath81 although it is difficult to find the exact solutions of the above equations , one can easily obtain a set of steady state solutions for eq .",
    "( [ eq : station ] ) by taking @xmath82 .",
    "such a state is called coherent population trapping ( cpt ) state which yields , @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",

    "for such a laser field , at the initial time ( @xmath90 ) , we have @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which implies there are no molecules in the system at the initial time . at the final time ( @xmath89 ) , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 ; whereas @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 . with the help of initial values of @xmath102 and their asymptotic values at final time ,",
    "it is easy to find that those fermionic atoms , in the presence of their counterparts , can be converted into molecules if the cpt states can be followed adiabatically .",
    "the residual atoms can not be converted into molecules due to the lack of counterpart atoms .",
    "after the numerical calculation in next section , we will go back to study whether the cpt state can be followed adiabatically with the help of the useful concept , adiabatic fidelity .",
    "we know that there are two sorts of fermionic atoms @xmath0li and @xmath1k in the group of alkali - metal atoms .",
    "they have been converted into molecules in experiments successfully through the bare feshbach resonance  @xcite . in those experiments , 60% to 80% of @xmath1k atoms and",
    "no more than 85% of @xmath0li atoms can be converted into molecules . for @xmath0li atoms , the atom - to - molecule conversion efficiency via",
    "bare feshbach resonance is lower than that via stirap technique aided by feshbach resonance , which is in contrast to the case for @xmath1k atoms . due to the difference in atomic properties , the atom - to - molecule conversion efficiency differs for different atoms even if the same technique is applied .",
    "now we evaluate the atom - to - molecule conversion efficiency , respectively , for @xmath0li and @xmath1k atoms with concrete magnetic and laser fields .",
