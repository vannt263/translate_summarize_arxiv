    "boutet de monvel s calculus @xcite is a pseudodifferential calculus on manifolds with boundary .",
    "it includes the classical differential boundary value problems as well as the parametrices to elliptic elements .",
    "many operator - algebraic aspects of this algebra ( spectral invariance , noncommutative residues and traces , composition sequence , @xmath14-theory ) have been studied recently @xcite .",
    "the problem of identifying this algebra as the pseudodifferential algebra ( or as an ideal of one ) of a lie groupoid may be the key to an effective application of the methods of noncommutative geometry .",
    "if that is acomplished , one could then seek for extensions of the calculus , and for a better understanding of its index theory @xcite .",
    "basic definitions and certain facts about boutet de monvel s algebra are recalled in section  [ bdmc ] .",
    "the groupoid approach to pseudodifferential calculus was developed in noncommutative geometry , following the seminal work of a. connes for foliations @xcite .",
    "the guiding principle in that approach is that the central object in global analysis is a groupoid . to study a particular situation , for a class of singular manifolds for instance",
    ", one needs to define a groupoid adapted to the context and then use the general pseudodifferential tools for groupoids , as developed in @xcite .",
    "this has been applied to the context of manifolds with corners , with the goal of studying melrose s @xmath15-calculus ( see @xcite ) .",
    "groupoids were defined whose pseudodifferential calculi recover the @xmath15-calculus and the cusp - calculus .",
    "basic definitions and certain facts about pseudodifferential calculus on groupoids are recalled in section  [ psi ] .",
    "the starting point of this work is the following result ( see @xcite ) : the kernel of the principal symbol map for boutet de monvel s calculus is equal to the norm closure @xmath16 of the ideal of singular green operators . since in the pseudodifferential calculus on a groupoid",
    ", the @xmath6-algebra of the groupoid is the kernel of the principal symbol map , this gives a hint that finding a groupoid whose @xmath6-algebra is @xmath17 could give some insight about the relationship between the boutet de monvel algebra and groupoid pseudodifferential algebras .    besides , @xmath16 fits into a short exact sequence ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7 ) ) : @xmath18 which is similar to that for pseudodifferential operators on smooth manifolds : @xmath19 in section  [ sgoi ] , we show that @xmath2 is actually morita - equivalent to the norm - closure @xmath7 of the algebra of pseudodifferential operators on the boundary . since @xmath2 is a stable , it is thus isomorphic to @xmath20 .    on the other hand , we define in section [ gr - sgo ] a groupoid whose @xmath6-algebra contains an ideal @xmath21 which fits in an extension analoguous as that of @xmath20 . by showing in section [ main ] that the @xmath22-theory elements induced by these extensions coincide , we infer from a theorem by voiculescu that @xmath2 and @xmath21 are isomorphic .",
    "let @xmath23 denote a compact manifold of dimension @xmath24 with boundary @xmath25 and interior @xmath26 .",
    "given a pseudodifferential operator @xmath27 , defined on an open neighborhood @xmath28 of @xmath23 , and @xmath29 , one defines @xmath30 as equal to the restriction to @xmath26 of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the extension of @xmath33 to @xmath28 which vanishes outside @xmath23 . in general",
    ", singularities may develop at the boundary , and one gets only a mapping @xmath34 .",
    "one says that @xmath27 has the _ transmission property _ if the image of the truncated operator @xmath35 is contained in @xmath36 ( a subspace of @xmath37 ) .",
    "this was defined by boutet de monvel in @xcite , where he proved that the transmission property for a classical ( polyhomogoneous ) pseudodifferential operator is equivalent to certain symmetry conditions for the homogeneous components of the asymptotic expansion of its symbol at the boundary .",
    "later @xcite , he constructed an algebra whose elements are operators of the form @xmath38 where @xmath27 is a pseudodifferential operator on @xmath23 satisfying a condition that ensures the transmission property , @xmath39 is a pseudodifferential operator on @xmath25 , while @xmath1 , @xmath14 and @xmath40 belong to classes of operators he then defined and named , respectively , singular green , poisson and trace operators .",
    "we call an operator as in ( [ bdmo ] ) a boutet de monvel operator . for detailed expositions of his calculus ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "a boutet de monvel operator has an _ order _ , roughly the usual order of pseudodifferential operators .",
    "the entries @xmath40 and @xmath1 have , moreover , an integer _ class _ assigned to them .",
    "the class of a trace operator is related to the order of the derivatives that appear in the boundary - value conditions it prescribes .",
    "one must assign a class also to singular green operators due to the fact that the composition @xmath41 is a singular green operator .",
    "there exist isomorphisms between suitable sobolev spaces such that the composition of a given operator of arbitrary order and class with one of them has order and class zero .",
    "for index theory purposes it is therefore sufficient to consider operators of order and class zero .",
    "these form an adjoint invariant subalgebra of the algebra @xmath42 of all bounded operators on a suitable hilbert space @xmath43 . adopting the definition of order in @xcite for @xmath14 and @xmath40 , we here choose @xmath44 .",
    "if , as does grubb @xcite , one keeps the original definition ( which makes more sense if one needs general @xmath45 estimates ) then one must take a sobolev space of order @xmath46 over the boundary .",
    "boutet de monvel operators can also be defined as mappings between smooth sections of vector bundles .",
    "if @xmath47 is a bundle of positive rank over @xmath23 , and @xmath48 is an arbitrary bundle over @xmath25 , then the algebra of all boutet de monvel operators of order and class zero acting between sections of @xmath47 and @xmath48 is morita equivalent ( * ? ? ? * section 1.5 ) to the algebra obtained by taking a rank - one trivial bundle over @xmath23 and the zero - bundle over @xmath25 .",
    "this partly justifies , again if one is interested in index theory , to consider only the operators appearing in the upper - left corner of the matrix in ( [ bdmo ] ) and to assume , as we did at the beginning , that the bundle over @xmath23 is @xmath49 .",
    "the problem of computing the fredholm index of a boutet de monvel operator acting between sections of different bundles over each side can be reduced to the case of equal bundles on both sides by a device developed by boutet de monvel @xcite , recalled in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.1 ) .",
    "let us now explain what a singular green operator @xmath1 is , in the case of order and class zero and of a rank - one trivial bundle over @xmath23 .",
    "its distribution kernel is smooth outside the boundary diagonal ; i.e , if @xmath50 , and if we denote by @xmath51 the operator of mulitiplication by @xmath52 , then @xmath53 and @xmath54 are integral operators with smooth kernels .",
    "the push - forward of @xmath1 by a boundary chart is an operator - valued - symbol pseudodifferential operator on the variables tangential to the boundary , as we describe below .",
    "it is perhaps worth stressing , however , that it is in general not a pseudodifferential operator on all variables , because of its particular way of acting on the normal variable .    given @xmath55 , @xmath56 , let @xmath57 denote the vector - valued fourier transform of @xmath33 with respect to the @xmath58 first variables , @xmath59 in local coordinates for which the boundary corresponds to @xmath60 and the interior to @xmath61 , @xmath1 is given by @xmath62 the integrals in ( [ ft ] ) or in ( [ defg ] ) should be regarded , for fixed @xmath63 or @xmath64 , respectively , as @xmath65-valued integrals . for each @xmath66 ,",
    "@xmath67 in ( [ defg ] ) is an integral operator with kernel @xmath68 equal to the restriction to @xmath69 of a function belonging to the schwartz space of rapidly decreasing functions on @xmath70 .",

    "it follows from the rules of boutet de monvel s calculus that @xmath73 is an algebra and that @xmath75 is an ideal in @xmath73 .    in the sequel",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to coordinate changes which preserve the variable @xmath76 , i.e. , we choose a normal coordinate . then two * -homomorphisms are defined on @xmath73 , the principal symbol and the boundary principal symbol : @xmath77 the principal symbol of a given @xmath74 is , by definition , the usual principal symbol of @xmath27 @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the leading term in the aymptotic expansion of the symbol of @xmath27 .    at a point @xmath80 in @xmath13 , the boundary principal symbol of @xmath35 is defined to be the truncated fourier multiplier @xmath81 of symbol @xmath82 .",
    "the boundary principal symbol of @xmath83 is the integral operator @xmath84 with the rapidly decreasing kernel @xmath85 , where @xmath86 denotes the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath87 , cf .",
    "* ( 1.2.39 ) ) . then @xmath88 maps @xmath75 into @xmath89 , with the ideal @xmath90 of compact operators on @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath91 and @xmath2 denote the norm closures of @xmath73 and @xmath75 , respectively ; and let @xmath92 denote the set of all compact operators on @xmath93 .",
