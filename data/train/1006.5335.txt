    "understanding the nature of dark matter is a key issue in contemporary particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "one of the prime candidates are the weakly interacting massive particles - wimps .",
    "most of the dark matter models predict that wimps interact only gravitationally and weakly with matter , thus forming cold relic halos around massive astronomical objects .",
    "though there is convincing evidence for dark matter from cosmology and astronomy , wimp interactions on ordinary matter are exceedingly rare and therefore direct detection of dark matter particles is very difficult and to - date no uncontroversial signal has been discovered @xcite,@xcite . from the experimental point of view , noble liquids , such as argon and xenon , are one of the best options for large wimp direct detection experiments .",
    "they combine the possibility of reaching ton - scale target masses , low energy threshold ( in the kev ) , and the necessary discrimination power against background .",
    "the argon dark matter experiment ( ardm ) was initiated in 2004 and is being developed at cern .",
    "the goal of the project is to assemble and operate the 1 ton scale double phase ( liquid - gas ) argon detector with independent readout of the primary scintillation light and the ionization charge .",
    "the principle of design and operation of the ardm detector is described in section [ secardmdesign ] .",
    "the conceptual design of the ardm experiment is illustrated in fig.[fig.design ] .",
    "a vacuum insulated , stainless steel dewar , 200 cm high and 100 cm in diameter , contains a sensitive mass of 850 kg of liquid argon . in order to create a strong uniform electric field along a vertical drift of the length of 120 cm ,",
    "a greinacher ( cockroft - walton ) chain keeps the cathode , placed at the bottom of the sensitive region , and the field shaping rings at the proper voltage .",
    "fourteen 8  low background photo multiplier tubes ( pmt ) , suitable for cryogenic operation , are used for light readout .",
    "they are placed below the cathode grid . in liquid argon ,",
    "the scintillation light is produced in a narrow bandwidth around 128 nm , in the vuv region , which is not directly detectable by the pmts and needs to be wavelength - shifted .",
    "the pmts are coated with tpb ( tetraphenylbutadiene ) that shifts the wavelength from the vuv to the visible part of the spectrum ( 420 nm ) .",
    "most of the direct scintillation light hits the sides of the detector rather than the pmts , therefore to enhance the light yield the sides of the detector are covered with tpb coated reflectors .",
    "the charge readout system is positioned above the liquid surface , in the argon vapor .",
    "this system extracts the ionization charge from the liquid phase into the vapor phase , provides charge multiplication and finally detects the induced signals on a segmented anode .",
    "charge multiplication is necessary in order to produce a detectable signal over noise for ionizing events with energies as low as few kevs .",
    "a multi - stage system of large electron multipliers ( lem ) can provide the necessary thousandfold charge multiplication .",
    "this lem readout system is being developed on a smaller scale in dedicated setup ( see section [ seclem ] ) . in order to drift free electrons in liquid argon over lengths of a meter",
    ", the concentration of electronegative impurities in liquid argon must be extremely small @xcite better than a part per billion ( ppb ) .",
    "this level of purity is obtained by recirculating the argon through a custom made copper filter .",
    "for the complete description and design details of the ardm detector see @xcite,@xcite .",
    "design and working principle of the double - phase argon dark matter detector.,title=\"fig : \" ]   design and working principle of the double - phase argon dark matter detector.,title=\"fig : \" ]      the ardm detector was filled with liquid argon for the first time in may 2009 .",
    "the run lasted for over a month .",
    "the light readout system was only partially completed and was deployed with 7 pmts in place .",
    "the goals of this month long run were : test of the cryogenic system ( cool down and stable operation ) , achieve good and stable liquid argon purity , commissioning and stable operation of the available light readout system , provide a preliminary measurement of the light yield , develop data reconstruction and provide data for benchmarking the monte carlo simulation .",
    "measurements of the light collection efficiency were performed with two gamma sources , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "data were taken in a variety of trigger configurations .",
    "figure [ fig.gammy ] shows the energy spectrum in units of photoelectrons ( p.e . ) from the exposure to @xmath2na .",
    "the 511 kev gamma rays were externally tagged through detection of the coincident 1274 kev and 511 kev gammas , the latter emitted back - to - back , with a nai counter . from these measurements , a light yield of 0.5 p.e./kev was determined for this partially instrumented detector .",
    "offline it was determined that the rms noise is approximately 2 p.e .",
    "for the 7 pmts , providing an energy threshold of few kevs . for a preliminary description of the measurements",
    "see also @xcite .",

    "a 3 l setup dedicated to r&d work for the lem readout has been built and has been in operation for the past two years @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is a scaled down version of the full ardm detector , with a pmt installed below the cathode , extraction grids at the liquid - vapor interface , lem for charge multiplication in the ar vapor and a segmented anode for readout .",
    "charge multiplication happens in the lem holes , where there is a high enough electric field to start townsend multiplication @xcite @xcite . a picture and a sketch of the small lem - tpc with one stage lem device is shown in figure [ fig.lemfoto ] .",
    "a lem is a thick macroscopic hole multiplier manufactured with standard pcb techniques .",
    "several different lems have been tested in this setup , differing for their geometrical parameters , manufacturers , or both .",
    "event shown here ( fig.[fig.event ] ) is for a one - stage lem , 1 mm thick , double - sided copper - clad plate drilled with a regular pattern of 500 @xmath3 m diameter holes , with a distance of 800 @xmath3 m between the centers of the neighboring holes .",
    "the lem itself is segmented ( strips with 6 mm pitch ) , and after the lem the charge is readout by a segmented anode , with strips ( 6 mm pitch ) oriented orthogonally with respect to lem s strips , thus providing x - y readout .     photograph ( left ) and schematics ( right ) of the argon lem - tpc 3 lt setup.,title=\"fig : \" ]   photograph ( left ) and schematics ( right ) of the argon lem - tpc 3 lt setup.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this double phase argon lem - tpc allows the reconstruction of the position of the ionizing event ( the value of third coordinate is assigned based on drift time ) . as an example , figure [ fig.event ] shows a typical cosmic muon track registered during double phase operation .",

    "the ardm detector has had a first run in spring 2009 , which allowed to test and commission the cryogenic system and a partially completed light readout system .",
    "more tests are foreseen for the remaining of year 2010 , with the fully completed light readout system in place .",
    "the detector will be operated as a full double phase lar tpc , with a direct readout of the ionization charge .",
    "after completion of the r&d and commissioning phase , ardm will be moved to an underground , low background location to start the dark matter science phase .",
